<text>The Professional Football Researchers Association (PFRA) is an organization of researchers whose mission is to preserve and, in some cases, reconstruct professional American football history. It was founded on June 22, 1979 in Canton, Ohio by writer/historian Bob Carroll and six other football researchers and is currently headed by an executive committee led by its president, George Bozeka, and executive director Leon Elder. Membership in the organization includes some of professional football&#x27;s foremost historians and authors. The organization is based in Guilford, New York.

The PFRA publishes books and a bimonthly magazine, The Coffin Corner, devoted to topics in professional football history. The organization also gives out awards each year for outstanding achievement in the field of football research.

==&quot;The Coffin Corner&quot;==

&quot;The Coffin Corner&quot; is a semimonthly magazine devoted to topics in professional football history. PFRA members publish their research findings in the articles, regardless of prior writing experience. In the case of newer authors and first-time contributors, the magazine&#x27;s editors assist, anonymously, in helping develop the narratives for publication. The $35.00 annual membership in the organization includes a subscription to six issues of &quot;The Coffin Corner&quot;, as well as access to the &quot;Members Only&quot; section of their website, which contains detailed research on a variety of pro football subjects.

== Books ==
In cooperation with McFarland &amp; Company, the PFRA is now working on the third installment in its &quot;Great Teams in Pro Football History&quot; series, edited by George Bozeka. Individual members of the association volunteer to author the different chapters, profiling in detail the players, the coaching staff, the preseason, regular season and postseason, and other elements of a team&#x27;s season. &quot;The 1966 Green Bay Packers: Profiles of Vince Lombardi&#x27;s Super Bowl I Champions&quot; was released in 2016, and &quot;The 1958 Baltimore Colts: Profiles of the NFL&#x27;s First Sudden Death Champions&quot; followed in 2018. Writing is underway for the chapters of a book about the 1951 Los Angeles Rams season, was released in 2022. The fourth book, about the 1964 Buffalo Bills season, will follow in 2024.

==Committees and research projects==

The PFRA maintains ongoing database projects, with committees of members who update the record as information develops, or as it is discovered in the course of research. Select committees may be disbanded as their work is completed.

;All-America Football Conference: (chair: Ken Crippen)
;Hall of Very Good Committee: The Hall of Very Good highlights outstanding players not in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. (chair: Andy Piascik)
;Biography Committee: Responsible for writing biographies of every NFL player. (chairs: Greg Tranter, Jeffrey J. Miller, George Bozeka)
;Education Committee: Collects and develops educational problems involving football for use in schools. (chair: Neal Golden)
;Linescore Committee: Responsible for compiling linescores for all professional games played since 1920. (chair: Gary Selby)
;Gamebooks Committee: The goal of the PFRA Gamebooks Committee is to collect gamebooks and play-by-play accounts for all of the games in NFL history. These can be a valuable tool for researchers, but acquiring them can be an arduous task. The goal is to share the collective efforts of a number of researchers and pool the results in one location, hopefully to foster future research. (chairs: Giovanni Malaty and Rupert Patrick)
;Membership Committee: For the PFRA&#x27;s internal purposes.
;Pre-NFL Pro Football Committee: Researches all professional football prior to 1920, such as the Ohio League, Western Pennsylvania Professional Football Circuit, the Chicago and Philadelphia circuits, and the New York Pro Football League. (chair: Roy Sye)
;Uniforms: Compiles all information on NFL, AFL and AAFC uniforms from 1933 to the present. (chair: Tim Brulia)

<text>Ernst Gräfenberg (26 September 1881 – 28 October 1957) was a German-born physician and scientist. He developed the intrauterine device (IUD), and studied the role of the woman&#x27;s urethra in orgasm. The G-spot is named after him.

==Career==
Gräfenberg studied medicine in Göttingen and Munich, earning his doctorate on 10 March 1905. He began working as a doctor of ophthalmology at the university of Würzburg, but then moved to the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the University of Kiel, where he published papers on cancer metastasis (the &quot;Gräfenberg theory&quot;), and the physiology of egg implantation. In 1910 Gräfenberg worked as a gynaecologist in Berlin, and by 1920 was quite successful, with an office on the Kurfürstendamm. He was chief gynaecologist of a municipal hospital in Britz, a working-class Berlin district, and was beginning scientific studies of the physiology of human reproduction at Berlin University.

During the First World War, he was a medical officer, and continued publishing papers, mostly on human female physiology. In 1929 he published his studies of the &quot;Gräfenberg ring&quot;, the first IUD for which there are usage records.

17th-century, Dutch physician Regnier de Graaf described female ejaculation and referred to an erogenous zone in the vagina that he linked with the male prostate; this zone was later reported by Gräfenberg. The term &quot;G-Spot&quot; was coined by Frank Addiego et al. in 1981, named after Gräfenberg, even though Gräfenberg&#x27;s 1940s research was dedicated to urethral stimulation. In 1950, Gräfenberg stated, &quot;An erotic zone always could be demonstrated on the anterior wall of the vagina along the course of the urethra.&quot;

When Nazis assumed power in Germany, Gräfenberg, a Jew, was forced in 1933 to resign as head of the department of gynaecology and obstetrics in the Berlin-Britz municipal hospital. In 1934, Hans Lehfeldt attempted to persuade him to leave Nazi Germany; he refused, believing that since his practice included wives of high Nazi officials, he would be safe. He was wrong and was arrested in 1937 for having smuggled out a valuable stamp from Germany. On 9 November 1938, he was sentenced to three years imprisonment by the Landgericht Berlin and received a large fine for this alleged offense. Until 15 August 1940 he was imprisoned in the Brandenburg-Görden Prison. Margaret Sanger ransomed him from prison, whereupon he went to the U.S. and opened a practice in New York City. Among others, the German novelist Erich Maria Remarque helped Gräfenberg to build his new existence in the U.S.

==Personal life==
Gräfenberg was born in Adelebsen near Göttingen, Germany, the son of Salomon Gräfenberg (1834–1918) and Minna Gräfenberg (née Eichenberg; 1845–1910). Ernst&#x27;s father owned an iron wares business in Adelebsen and served as the head of the Jewish community there from 1868 to 1882, and as an Adelebsen community council member (Bürgervorsteher) from 1889 to 1893. In 1893 the family moved to Göttingen, where Ernst attended the municipal high school, or Gymnasium, later known as the .

Gräfenberg was briefly married to writer Rosie Waldeck. He died largely unnoticed on 28 October 1957 in New York City, but the Jewish weekly &quot;Aufbau&quot; published an obituary. He was buried on the Ferncliff Cemetery.

<text>Sclerocarya birrea ( , meaning &quot;hard&quot;, and , &quot;nut&quot;, in reference to the stone inside the fleshy fruit), commonly known as the marula, is a medium-sized deciduous fruit-bearing tree, indigenous to the miombo woodlands of Southern Africa, the Sudano-Sahelian range of West Africa, the savanna woodlands of East Africa and Madagascar.

==Description==
The tree is a single-stemmed species with a broad, spreading crown. It is distinguished by its grey mottled bark and can grow up to 18 meters tall, primarily in low altitudes and open woodlands. The distribution of this species throughout Africa and Madagascar has followed the Bantu in their migrations. There is some evidence of human domestication of marula trees, as trees found on farm lands tend to have larger fruit size.

The fruits, which ripen between December and March, have a light yellow skin (exocarp), with white flesh (mesocarp). They fall to the ground when unripe and green in colour, and then ripen to a yellow colour on the ground. They are succulent and tart with a strong and distinctive flavour. Inside is a walnut-sized, thick-walled stone (endocarp). These stones, when dry, expose the seeds by shedding 2 (sometimes 3) small circular plugs at one end. The fruits are drupes with a single seed encased within their endocarp, although up to four seeds can be present. The seeds have a delicate nutty flavour and are much sought-after, especially by small rodents who know to gnaw exactly where the plugs are located.

The trees are dioecious. Male trees produce multiple male flowers on a terminal raceme. These have red sepals and petals, and about 20 stamens per flower. On rare occasion a male flower can produce a gynoecium, turning it bisexual. Female flowers grow individually on their own pedicel and have staminodes. The leaves are alternate, compound, and imparipinnately divided. The leaflet shapes range from round to elliptical.

==Taxonomy and etymology==
&quot;Sclerocarya birrea&quot; is divided into three subspecies: subsp. &quot;birrea&quot;, subsp. &quot;afra&quot; and subsp. &quot;multifoliolata.&quot; These subspecies are differentiated by changes in leaf shape and size. Subsp. &quot;birrea&quot; is found in northern Africa, subsp. &quot;afra&quot; is found in southern Africa, and subsp. &quot;multifoliolata&quot; is only found in Tanzania.

The generic name &quot;Sclerocarya&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek words &#x27;skleros&#x27; meaning &#x27;hard&#x27; and &#x27;karyon&#x27; meaning &#x27;nut&#x27;. This refers to the hard pit of the fruit. The specific epithet &#x27;birrea&#x27; comes from the common name &#x27;birr&#x27;, for this type of tree in Senegal. The marula belongs to the same family, Anacardiaceae, as the mango, cashew, pistachio and sumac, and is closely related to the genus &quot;Poupartia&quot; from Madagascar.

Common names include jelly plum, cat thorn, morula, cider tree, marula, maroola nut/plum, and in Afrikaans, maroela.

==Subspecies==
Three subspecies are accepted:
*&quot;Sclerocarya birrea&quot; subsp. &quot;afra&quot; – Kenya to Namibia and KwaZulu-Natal, Madagascar, and Mayotte
*&quot;Sclerocarya birrea&quot; subsp. &quot;birrea&quot; – West Africa to Ethiopia and Tanzania
*&quot;Sclerocarya birrea&quot; subsp. &quot;multifoliolata&quot; – Tanzania

==Uses==
===Traditional uses===
The fruit is traditionally used for food in Africa, and has considerable socioeconomic importance. The fruit juice and pulp are mixed with water and stored in a container over 1–3 days of fermentation to make marula beer, a traditional alcoholic beverage. The alcoholic distilled beverage (morula) made from the fruit is referenced in the stories of the South African writer Herman Charles Bosman. Marula oil is used topically to moisturise the skin, and as an edible oil in the diet of San people in Southern Africa. The marula tree is protected in South Africa.

===Commercial uses===
On an industrial level the fruit of the marula tree is collected from the wild by members of rural communities on whose land the trees grow. This harvest and sale of fruit only occur over two to three months, but is an important source of income to poor rural people, especially women. The fruit is delivered to processing plants where fruit pulp, pips, kernels and kernel oil are extracted and stored for processing throughout the year.

===Uses by other species===
The marula fruit is eaten by various animals in Southern Africa. Giraffes, rhinoceroses and elephants all browse on the marula tree, with elephants in particular being a major consumer. Elephants eat the bark, branches and fruits of the marula, which may limit the spread of the trees. The damaged bark, due to browsing, can be used to identify marula trees as elephants preferentially target them. Elephants distribute marula seeds in their dung. In the documentary &quot;Animals Are Beautiful People&quot; by Jamie Uys, released in 1974, some scenes portray elephants, ostriches, warthogs and baboons allegedly becoming intoxicated from eating fermented marula fruit, as do reports in the popular press. While the fruit is commonly eaten by elephants, the animals would need a huge amount of fermented marulas to have any effect on them, and other animals prefer the ripe fruit.

The marula fruit has been suggested to be the food of choice for the ancestral forest-dwelling form of the fruit fly &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, which was much more selective about which fruit they preferred than the flies that have self-domesticated to live near to humans. The ancestral fruit flies are triggered by the ester ethyl isovalerate in the marula fruit.

<text>Amarula is a cream liqueur from South Africa. It is made with sugar, cream and the fruit of the African marula tree (&quot;Sclerocarya birrea&quot;) which is also locally called the elephant tree or the marriage tree. It has an alcohol content of 17% by volume (34 proof). It has had some success at international spirit ratings competitions, winning a gold medal at the 2009 San Francisco World Spirits Competition. It has the taste of slightly fruity caramel.

==History==
Amarula was first marketed by Southern Liqueur Company of South Africa (the current trademark owners and wholly owned subsidiary of Distell Group Limited) as a liqueur in September 1989, the Amarula spirit having been launched in 1983.

==Flavors==
# Amarula Cream Liqueur 17% ABV

# Raspberry, Chocolate &amp; African Baobab Cream Liqueur 15.5% ABV (launched in 2019)
# Amarula Vanilla Spice Cream Liqueur 15.5% ABV
# Amarula Vegan Liqueur 15.5% ABV
# Khanyisa Limited Edition 15.5% ABV - Proceeds go towards rehabilitating Khanyisa, an orphaned albino baby elephant cruelly injured in a poacher&#x27;s snare.

==Elephant-associated marketing==
African bush elephants enjoy eating the fruit of the marula tree. Because of the marula tree&#x27;s association with elephants, the distiller has made them its symbol and supports elephant conservation efforts, co-funding the Amarula Elephant Research Programme at the University of Natal, Durban. For marketing efforts, it produces elephant-themed collectible items.

The brand supports elephant research to protect elephants and conserve the population. In 2002, the Amarula Elephant Research Program (AERP) was launched under the direction of Rob Slotow, a professor at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban, South Africa. This primarily researches the way of life, the range of movement and the behavior of the African elephant with the aim of protecting the habitat of the elephants and securing their future in the wild.

<text>USS &quot;Albacore&quot; (AGSS-569) is a unique research submarine that pioneered the American version of the teardrop hull form (sometimes referred to as an &quot;&quot;Albacore&quot; hull&quot;) of modern submarines. The revolutionary design was derived from extensive hydrodynamic and wind tunnel testing, with an emphasis on underwater speed and maneuverability. She was the third vessel of the United States Navy to be named for the albacore.

Her keel was laid down on 15 March 1952 by the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard of Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 1 August 1953, sponsored by Mrs. J. E. Jowers, the widow of Chief Motor Machinist&#x27;s Mate Arthur L. Stanton, lost with the second &quot;Albacore&quot; (SS-218), and commissioned on 6 December 1953 with Lieutenant Commander Kenneth C. Gummerson in command.

The effectiveness of submarines in World War II convinced both the Soviet Navy and the United States Navy that undersea warfare would play an even more important role in coming conflicts and dictated development of superior submarines. The advent of nuclear power nourished the hope that such warships could be produced. The effort to achieve this goal involved the development of a nuclear propulsion system and the design of a streamlined submarine hull capable of optimum submerged performance.

==Development==
Late in World War II, committees on both sides of the Iron Curtain studied postwar uses of atomic energy and recommended the development of nuclear propulsion for ships. Since nuclear power plants would operate without the oxygen supply needed by conventional machinery, and since techniques were available for oxygen generation and carbon dioxide removal, submarine designers turned their attention to vessels which could operate for long periods without surfacing. Veteran submariners visualized a new type of submarine in which surface performance characteristics would be completely subordinated to high submerged speed and agility. In 1949 a special committee began a series of hydrodynamic studies which led to a program within the US Bureau of Ships to determine what hull form would be best for submerged operation. The David Taylor Model Basin in Maryland tested a series of designs. The best two—one with a single propeller and the other with dual screws—were then tested in a wind tunnel at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia. To avoid interference from the various departments of the Navy, Admiral Momsen proposed to build a submarine as a practice target for aircraft carriers to practice Anti-submarine Warfare against, and directed the Bureau of Ships to design an unarmed sub for speed. The single-screw version was adopted, and construction of an experimental submarine to this design was authorized on 25 November 1950. The hull of the &quot;Albacore&quot; utilized HY-80 high-strength steel with a yield strength of , although this was not initially used to increase the diving depth relative to other US submarines. HY-80 remained the standard submarine steel through the &quot;Los Angeles&quot; class. Other components were made from high-tensile steel (HTS). This ship was classified as an auxiliary submarine (AGSS-569) and named &quot;Albacore&quot;. In this instance, AGSS stands for Auxiliary General Submersible Submarine which for the U.S. Navy meant the first hull of its kind for the fleet.

==Evaluations==

Following preliminary acceptance trials, the new submarine departed Portsmouth on 8 April 1954 for shakedown training. She began the first cycle of a career in which she experimented extensively with a given configuration and then returned to Portsmouth for extensive modifications to evaluate different design concepts, to help the Navy develop better hull configurations for future submarines. On this initial cruise, she operated out of New London, Connecticut, before sailing for Key West, Florida, to conduct operations out of that port and in Cuban waters. She returned to Portsmouth on 3 July for more than a year of trials in cooperation with the David Taylor Model Basin. Throughout these operations, she underwent repairs and modification to eliminate technical problems. It was found during these early sea trials &quot;Albacore&quot; could operate at the same maximum speed as the older modernized Guppy-type submarines with half the shaft horsepower.

The submarine departed Portsmouth on 12 October 1955 and sailed via Block Island for Key West, where she arrived on 19 October 1955 to commence antisubmarine warfare evaluation and to provide target services to the Operational Development Force&#x27;s Surface Antisubmarine Development Detachment. On 4 November 1955, Admiral Arleigh Burke, Chief of Naval Operations, embarked on &quot;Albacore&quot; for a brief demonstration cruise. Lord Mountbatten accompanied Admiral Burke on the cruise. On 19 November 1955, &quot;Albacore&quot; sailed for a rendezvous point off the Bahamas where she conducted special operations until 24 November 1955 and then returned to Portsmouth.

From December 1955 to March 1956, &quot;Albacore&quot; underwent stern renewal. Until this time, her propeller had been surrounded by the rudder and stern plane control surfaces. With her &quot;new look&quot;, she resembled a blimp, with her propeller aft of all control surfaces.

Operation with her new stern configuration started in April 1956, and continued until late in the year. In May, &quot;Albacore&quot; visited New York City and participated in the television production &quot;Wide, Wide World&quot;, during which she submerged, with an underwater camera mounted on her forecastle, the first live telecast of a submarine while diving.

==More tests==

In November 1956, &quot;Albacore&quot; reentered the shipyard for engine conversion. She departed New London on 11 March 1957, for operations out of San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. The submarine returned to Boston, Massachusetts, on 2 April 1957 and operated locally out of Boston and Portsmouth until entering the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard early in 1958 for an overhaul which lasted until June.

The ensuing tests emphasized sound reduction and included extensive evaluation of Aqua-Plas, a sound-damping elastic which had been applied to the ship&#x27;s superstructure and tank interiors. In October 1958, her bow planes were removed to further reduce noise. The submarine ended the year with a fortnight&#x27;s run to Halifax, Nova Scotia, and back to serve as a target ship for Canadian warships.

In 1959, a newly designed 14-foot propeller was installed and tested. &quot;Albacore&quot; sailed south late in May and, after operating in the British West Indies for two weeks, proceeded to Key West to serve as a target for the Surface Antisubmarine Development Detachment. After returning north, she spent much of the remainder of 1959 and most of 1960 undergoing widely varied tests for the David Taylor Model Basin. One of the more unusual tests consisted of evaluating a concave bow sonar dome.

Subsequent post-1959 design went into the &quot;Barbel&quot;-class submarine design, of which three boats were produced. These three submarines looked generally the same as Albacore, although longer. Only one survives today, the USS &quot;Blueback&quot; (SS-581).

==Reconfigurations==

On 21 November 1960, the ship entered Portsmouth for a major overhaul and conversion in which she received: a new, experimental, X-shaped tail for increased control; 10 dive brakes around her hull, a new bow which included modified forward ballast tanks, new sonar systems, and a large auxiliary rudder in the after part of her sail. Following the completion of this work in August 1961, she operated along the east coast learning the effect of her new configuration and equipment upon her capabilities and performance.

In 1962, she received a newly developed DIMUS sonar system and, on 7 December 1962, work began on her fourth major conversion which included the installation of concentric contra-rotating propellers, a high-capacity silver-zinc battery and a larger main motor. New radio equipment, BQS-4 and BQR-2 sonars, an emergency recovery system, and a new main ballast tank blow system were also added. After work was completed in March 1965, &quot;Albacore&quot; prepared for deployment to Florida waters to study the results of her changes. This was the second time that she achieved a world record speed for submarine travel, submerged. She returned to Portsmouth on 8 October 1965 and continued to evaluate her capabilities under the new configuration. On 1 August 1966, she reentered the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard to replace the silver-zinc battery and to shorten the distance between the contra-rotating propellers — work which lasted into August 1967.

Standardization and machinery tests in the Gulf of Maine during September were followed by evaluation of towed sonar arrays off Port Everglades, Florida, in October and November, followed by acoustics trials in the Tongue of the Ocean, a deep channel in the Central Bahama Islands.

On 1 January 1968, the submarine returned to Portsmouth for a modification of her propulsion system which kept her in the navy yard until 19 April. Following a month of trials in the Gulf of Maine, she headed south for evaluation of her new MONOB I and AUTEC systems and of Fly-Around-Body (FAB) Phase I equipment in the Tongue of the Ocean. She returned to Portsmouth on 24 August 1968 for AUTEC de-instrumentation and installation of FAB Phase II equipment. Following evaluation of this new gear in the Gulf of Maine, the &quot;Albacore&quot; returned to Portsmouth on 30 September and entered reduced operating status pending the results of further studies on the feasibility of using her thereafter for further research.

The sub remained mostly inactive until 2 February 1970, when she began an overhaul in drydock and modifications to prepare her for Project SURPASS, researching the use of polymer mixed with fresh water to reduce drag, sponsored by the Naval Ship Research and Development Center at Carderock, Maryland. The ship left drydock on 16 April 1971, commenced sea trials on 22 July 1971, and completed them in August 1971. Early in October, she operated off Provincetown, Massachusetts, to calibrate her sonar and radar equipment.

==Decommissioning==

After frequent diesel engine failures had caused repeated delays in her operations, her deployment in support of Project SURPASS was canceled, and preparations for her deactivation were begun. She used the General Motors EMD 16-338 lightweight, compact, high-speed &quot;pancake&quot; engine. These had also been used on the , but were replaced on them due to problems, and their &quot;pancake&quot; engines were used as spare parts (the engines were not replaced on &quot;Albacore&quot; due to space constraints). The unreliability of the engines and lack of spares led to the decommissioning of &quot;Albacore&quot; as further cannibalized parts became unavailable.

A dockside retirement ceremony was held at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard on 1 September 1972, attended by Rear Adm. J. Edward Snyder, who delivered comments on behalf of Robert A. Frosch, Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research and Development, referring to &quot;Albacore&quot; as &quot;the submarine that gave its body to science.&quot; &quot;Albacore&quot; was decommissioned on 9 December 1972 and laid up at the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility in the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 May 1980.

==Phases==
Operational history of the &quot;Albacore&quot; consisted of five phases (and an unrealized sixth phase):
* Phase I / project SCB 56 (December 1953 to December 1955)
** Bow planes, control surfaces aft of propeller, 11-foot diameter propeller, dorsal rudder
* Phase II / SCB 182 (March 1956 to November 1960)
** Control surfaces forward of propeller, 14-foot diameter propeller, dorsal rudder removed
* Phase III / SCB 182A (August 1961 to December 1962)
** X-stern, dive brakes, larger dorsal rudder
* Phase IV (March 1965 to February 1970)
** Aft pressure hull enlarged and surrounding ballast tanks eliminated to accommodate two main propulsion motors, contra-rotating propellers, silver zinc battery
* Phase V (April 1971 to September 1972)
** Bow and amidships polymer ejection manifolds and sail seawater intake scoop for Project SURPASS
* Phase VI (unrealized)
** Hull would be lengthened 12-feet to accommodate larger, more reliable diesels

==Legacy==
A non-profit group, the Portsmouth Submarine Memorial Association, was formed to bring the &quot;Albacore&quot; back to Portsmouth and place her on permanent display, designed to be on dry land so the entire submarine would be visible. The &quot;Albacore&quot; was towed back to Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in April 1984, by an Army Reserve tugboat in a journey of that took 70 hours.

In May 1985, she was moved across Portsmouth Harbor towards a permanent display site. The move was difficult, as a railway trestle had to be removed and a temporary cut, large enough to float her through, had to be made across a four-lane road. During the move, the &quot;Albacore&quot; struck bottom three times, followed by a catastrophic derailment of the temporary marine railway that had been constructed to bring her out of the water. The &quot;Albacore&quot; was left grounded in mud, short of her final resting place. Months later, a temporary cofferdam was constructed, she was re-floated, and on 3 October 1985, she was successfully placed in her permanent display cradle. After significant volunteer work to prepare her for display, the &quot;Albacore&quot; opened to the public on 30 August 1986.

&quot;Albacore&quot;″s service as an active experimental submersible for more than two decades steadily increased the Navy&#x27;s knowledge of both theoretical and applied hydrodynamics which it used in designing faster, quieter, more maneuverable and safer submarines. The Navy&#x27;s effort to build hulls capable of optimum operation while submerged was wedded to its nuclear propulsion program in the submarine &quot;Skipjack&quot; which was laid down in the spring of 1956, and these two concepts have complemented each other in the design of all of the Navy&#x27;s subsequent submarines.

&quot;Albacore&quot; is located at Albacore Park, 600 Market Street, Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and is open to the public. At this time, the Visitors Center at the USS Albacore Museum is under construction to expand their exhibit space. Inside the current Visitor Center, there is a small exhibit space that includes information regarding the USS Albacore, the USS Dolphin, the USS Thresher, and other maritime histories. The new portion of the Visitor Center is going to be a combination of maritime history of the Piscataqua region and submarine history covering the diesel age into the nuclear revolution. This means that the exhibit space in the original museum is going to focus entirely on the USS Albacore and her history. Artifacts from the USS Albacore Museum&#x27;s Archive are going to be on display for the first time in some instances and will serve to expand the knowledge and history of the USS Albacore. She is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and was designated a National Historic Landmark on 11 April 1989. In 2005, the United States Submarine Veterans of World War II inducted the &quot;Albacore&quot; into the Submarine Hall of Fame. In 2016, the basin area around the submarine at Albacore Park was completely reconstructed.

<text>More than 100 complete translations into English languages have been produced.
Translations of Biblical books, especially passages read in the Liturgy can be traced back to the late 7th century, including translations into Old and Middle English. 

== Old English ==

The Old English language started first from the Angle-Jute-Saxon invaders/settlers in the South and Eastern regions and evolved influenced by Anglo-Danish invaders/settlers in the North and Eastern Danelaw, to the extent that an Icelandic saga around the year 1000 said the language of England was the same as Norway and Denmark. It largely replaced the Neo-Brittonic languages and residual Anglo-Latin-using pockets.

While there were no complete translations of the Bible in the Old English period, there were many translations of large portions during this time. Parts of the Bible were first translated from the Latin Vulgate by a few monks and scholars. Such translations were generally in the form of prose or as interlinear glosses (literal translations above the Latin words).

Very few complete translations existed during that time. Most of the books of the Bible existed separately and were read as individual texts. Translations of the Bible often included the writer&#x27;s own commentary on passages in addition to the literal translation.

Aldhelm, Bishop of Sherborne and Abbot of Malmesbury (639–709), is thought to have written an Old English translation of the Psalms.

Bede (&quot;c.&quot; 672–735) produced a translation of the Gospel of John into Old English, which he is said to have prepared shortly before his death. This translation is lost; we know of its existence from Cuthbert of Jarrow&#x27;s account of Bede&#x27;s death.

In the 10th century an Old English translation of the Gospels was made in the Lindisfarne Gospels: a word-for-word gloss inserted between the lines of the Latin text by Aldred, Provost of Chester-le-Street. This is the oldest extant translation of the Gospels into an English language.

The &quot;Wessex Gospels&quot; (also known as the &quot;West-Saxon Gospels&quot;) are a full translation of the four gospels into a West Saxon dialect of Old English. Produced in approximately 990, they are the first translation of all four gospels into English without the Latin text.

In the 11th century, Abbot Ælfric translated much of the Old Testament into Old English. The &quot;Old English Hexateuch&quot; is an illuminated manuscript of the first six books of the Old Testament (the Hexateuch).

== Middle English ==

There are no known complete translations (pandects) from early in this period, when Middle English emerged after Anglo-Norman replaced Old English (Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Danish) as the aristocratic and secular court languages (1066), with Latin still the religious, diplomatic, scientific and ecclesiastical court language, and with parts of the country still speaking Cornish, and perhaps Cumbric.

The Ormulum is in Middle English of the 12th century. Like its Old English precursor from Ælfric, an abbot of Eynsham, it includes very little Biblical text, and focuses more on personal commentary. This style was adopted by many of the original English translators. For example, the story of the Wedding at Cana is almost 800 lines long, but fewer than 40 lines are in the actual translation of the text. An unusual characteristic is that the translation mimics Latin verse, and so is similar to the better known and appreciated 14th-century English poem &quot;Cursor Mundi&quot;.

Richard Rolle (1290–1349) wrote an English Psalter. Many religious works are attributed to Rolle, but it has been questioned how many are genuinely from his hand. Many of his works were concerned with personal devotion, and some were used by the Lollards.

Theologian John Wycliffe (c. 1320s–1384) is popularly credited with translating what is now known as Wycliffe&#x27;s Bible, though it is not clear how much of the translation he himself did. Released in 1382, this was the first known complete translation of the Bible into English. This translation came out in two different versions. The earlier version (&quot;EV&quot;) is characterised by a strong adherence to the word order of Latin, and is more difficult for native English speakers to comprehend. The later version (&quot;LV&quot;) made more concessions to the native grammar of English. 

Around the same period there were several other translations, which partially survive, such as the Paues &quot;Fortheenth Century Middle English New Testament&quot;.

== Early Modern and Modern English ==


=== Early Modern English ===
Early Modern English Bible translations are of between about 1500 and 1800, the period of Early Modern English. This was the first major period of Bible translation into the English language.

This period began with the introduction of the Tyndale Bible. The first complete edition of his New Testament was in 1526. William Tyndale used the Greek and Hebrew texts of the New Testament (NT) and Old Testament (OT) in addition to Jerome&#x27;s Latin translation. He was the first translator to use the printing press – this enabled the distribution of several thousand copies of his New Testament translation throughout England. Tyndale did not complete his Old Testament translation.

The first printed English translation of the whole Bible was produced by Miles Coverdale in 1535, using Tyndale&#x27;s work together with his own translations from the Latin Vulgate or German text. After much scholarly debate it is concluded that this was printed in Antwerp and the colophon gives the date as 4 October 1535. This first edition was adapted by Coverdale for his first &quot;authorised version&quot;, known as the Great Bible, of 1539.

Other early printed versions were the Geneva Bible published by Sir Rowland Hill in 1560. This version is notable for being the first Bible divided into verses and which negated the Divine Right of Kings; the Bishop&#x27;s Bible (1568), which was an attempt by Elizabeth I to create a new authorised version; and the Authorized King James Version of 1611.

The first complete Catholic Bible in English was the Douay–Rheims Bible, of which the New Testament portion was published in Rheims in 1582 and the Old Testament somewhat later in Douay in Gallicant Flanders. The Old Testament was completed by the time the New Testament was published but, due to extenuating circumstances and financial issues, it was not published until nearly three decades later, in two editions: the first released in 1609, and the rest of the OT in 1610. In this version, the seven deuterocanonical books are amongst the other books, as in the Latin Vulgate, rather than kept separate in an appendix.

=== Modern English ===
While early English Bibles were generally based on a small number of Greek texts, or on Latin translations, modern English translations of the Bible are based on a wider variety of manuscripts in the original languages, mostly Greek and Hebrew.

The translators put much scholarly effort into cross-checking the various sources such as the Septuagint, Textus Receptus, and Masoretic Text. Relatively recent discoveries such as the Dead Sea scrolls provide additional reference information. Some controversy has existed over which texts should be used as a basis for translation, as some of the alternate sources do not include phrases (or sometimes entire verses) which are found only in the Textus Receptus.

Some say the alternate sources were poorly representative of the texts used in their time, whereas others claim the Textus Receptus includes passages that were added to the alternate texts improperly. These controversial passages are not the basis for disputed issues of doctrine: they tend to be additional stories or snippets of phrases. Many modern English translations, such as the New International Version, contain limited text notes indicating where differences occur in original sources.

A somewhat greater number of textual differences are noted in the New King James Bible, indicating hundreds of New Testament differences between the Nestle-Aland, the Textus Receptus, and the Hodges edition of the Majority Text. The differences in the Old Testament are less well documented, but they do contain some references to differences between consonantal interpretations in the Masoretic Text, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and the Septuagint. Even with these hundreds of differences, however, a more complete listing is beyond the scope of most single-volume Bibles.

=== Individual translations ===

=== Jewish translations ===

Jewish English Bible translations are modern English Bible translations that include the books of the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) according to the Masoretic Text, and according to the traditional division and order of Torah, Nevi&#x27;im, and Ketuvim.

Jewish translations often also reflect traditional Jewish interpretations of the Bible, as opposed to the Christian understanding that is often reflected in non-Jewish translations. For example, Jewish translations translate עלמה &quot;‘almâh&quot; in Isaiah 7:14 as &quot;young woman&quot;, while many Christian translations render the word as &quot;virgin&quot;.

While modern biblical scholarship is similar for both Christians and Jews, there are distinctive features of Jewish translations, even those created by academic scholars. These include the avoidance of Christological interpretations, adherence to the Masoretic Text (at least in the main body of the text, as in the new Jewish Publication Society (JPS) translation) and greater use of classical Jewish exegesis. Some translations prefer names transliterated from the Hebrew, though the majority of Jewish translations use the Anglicized forms of biblical names.

The first English Jewish translation of the Bible into English was by Isaac Leeser in the 19th century.

The JPS produced two of the most popular Jewish translations, namely the JPS &quot;The Holy Scriptures&quot; of 1917 and the NJPS &quot;Tanakh&quot; (first printed in a single volume in 1985, second edition in 1999).

Since the 1980s there have been multiple efforts among Orthodox publishers to produce translations that are not only Jewish, but also adhere to Orthodox norms. Among these are The Living Torah and Nach by Aryeh Kaplan and others, the Torah and other portions in an ongoing project by Everett Fox, and the ArtScroll Tanakh.

== Approaches to translation ==
Modern translations take different approaches to the rendering of the original languages of approaches. The approaches can usually be considered to be somewhere on a scale between the two extremes:
* Formal equivalence (sometimes called literal translation) in which the greatest effort is made to preserve the meaning of individual words and phrases in the original, with relatively less regard for its understandability by modern readers. Examples include the King James Version, English Standard Version, Literal Standard Version, Revised Standard Version, New Revised Standard Version and New American Standard Bible.
* Dynamic equivalence (or functional equivalence, sometimes paraphrastic translation) in which the translator attempts to render the sense and intent of the original. Examples include The Living Bible and The Message.

Some translations have been motivated by a strong theological distinctive. In the Sacred Name Bibles the conviction that God&#x27;s name be preserved in a Semitic form is followed. The Purified Translation of the Bible promotes the idea that Jesus and early Christians drink grape juice not wine. The Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses&#x27; &quot;New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures&quot; renders the tetragrammaton as &quot;Jehovah&quot; throughout the Old Testament, and it uses the form &quot;Jehovah&quot; in the New Testament including — but not limited to — passages quoting the Old Testament even though it does not appear in the Greek text.

=== Single source translations ===
While most translations attempt to synthesize the various texts in the original languages, some translations also translate one specific textual source, generally for scholarly reasons. A single volume example for the Old Testament is &quot;The Dead Sea Scrolls Bible&quot; () by Martin Abegg, Peter Flint and Eugene Ulrich.

&quot;The Comprehensive New Testament&quot; () by T. E. Clontz and J. Clontz presents a scholarly view of the New Testament text by conforming to the Nestle-Aland 27th edition and extensively annotating the translation to fully explain different textual sources and possible alternative translations.

&quot;A Comparative Psalter&quot; () edited by John Kohlenberger presents a comparative diglot translation of the Psalms of the Masoretic Text and the Septuagint, using the Revised Standard Version and the New English Translation of the Septuagint.

R. A. Knox&#x27;s Translation of the Vulgate into English is another example of a single source translation.

=== Alternative approaches ===
Most translations make the translators&#x27; best attempt at a single rendering of the original, relying on footnotes where there might be alternative translations or textual variants. An alternative is taken by the Amplified Bible. In cases where a word or phrase admits of more than one meaning the Amplified Bible presents all the possible interpretations, allowing the reader to choose one. For example, the first two verses of the Amplified Bible read:

In the beginning God (Elohim) created [by forming from nothing] the heavens and the earth. The earth was formless and void &quot;or&quot; a waste and emptiness, and darkness was upon the face of the deep [primeval ocean that covered the unformed earth]. The Spirit of God was moving (hovering, brooding) over the face of the waters.
== Popularity in US ==
The Evangelical Christian Publishers Association release monthly and annual statistics regarding the popularity of different Bibles sold by their members in the United States. In 2023, the top 10 best-selling translations were the following:

Sales are affected by denomination and religious affiliation. For example, the most popular Jewish version would not compete with rankings of a larger audience. Sales data can be affected by the method of marketing. Some translations are directly marketed to particular denominations or local churches, and many Christian booksellers only offer Protestant Bibles, so books in other biblical canons (such as Catholic and Orthodox Bibles) may not appear as high on the CBA rank.

A study published in 2014 by The Center for the Study of Religion and American Culture at Indiana University and Purdue University found that Americans read versions of the Bible as follows:

# King James Version (55%)
# New International Version (19%)
# New Revised Standard Version (7%)
# New American Bible (6%)
# The Living Bible (5%)
# All other translations (8%)

<text>A Spanish creole (), or Spanish-based creole language, is a creole language (contact language with native speakers) for which Spanish serves as its substantial &quot;lexifier&quot;.

A number of creole languages are influenced to varying degrees by the Spanish language, including varieties known as Bozal Spanish, Chavacano, and Palenquero. Spanish also influenced other creole languages like Annobonese, Papiamento, and Pichinglis.

Any number of Spanish-based pidgins have arisen due to contact between Spanish and other languages, especially in America, such as the used by the Panare people of Venezuela and Roquetas Pidgin Spanish used by agricultural workers in Spain. However, few Spanish pidgins ever creolized with speakers of most pidgins eventually adopting Spanish or other language as their main tongue.

==Spanish creole languages==

===Bozal Spanish===
Bozal Spanish is a possibly extinct Spanish-based creole language that may have been a mixture of Spanish and Kikongo, with Portuguese influences. Attestation is insufficient to indicate whether Bozal Spanish was ever a single, coherent or stable language, or if the term merely referred to any idiolect of Spanish that included African elements.

Bozal Spanish was spoken by African slaves in the Spanish Caribbean and other areas of South and Central America from the 17th century up until its possible extinction at around 1850. It&#x27;s influenced the variety spoken in the Chota Valley in Ecuador, and a Spanish-based creole is still spoken in the Bolivian Yungas.

===Chavacano===

Chavacano (also Chabacano) is a group of Spanish-based creole language varieties spoken in the Philippines that emerged during the 18th century following the colonization of the Spaniards in the Philippines. While Chavacano refers to a large number of varieties, there are three main varieties: Ternate, Manila/Cavite, and Zamboanga.Ternate and Manila/Cavite are Northern dialects from Manila Bay on Luzon Island, while Zamboanga is a Southern dialect from Mindanao Island; both of these dialects are genetically related. The variety found in Zamboanga City has the largest number of speakers and is considered to be the most stable while the other varieties are considered to be either endangered or extinct (i.e. Ermitaño).

Creole varieties are spoken in Cavite City and Ternate (both on Luzon); Zamboanga, Cotabato and Davao (on Mindanao), Isabela City and other parts of province of Basilan and elsewhere. According to a 2007 census, there are 2,502,185 speakers in the Philippines. It is the major language of Zamboanga City.

While the different varieties of Chavacano are mostly intelligible to one another, they differ slightly in certain aspects such as in the usage of certain words and certain grammatical syntax. Most of the vocabulary comes from Spanish, while the grammar is mostly based on the Austronesian structure. In Zamboanga, its variant is used in primary education, television, and radio. Recently English and Filipino words have been infiltrating the language and code-switching between these three languages is common among younger speakers.

The name of the language stems from the Spanish word &quot;Chabacano&quot; which roughly means &quot;tasteless&quot;, &quot;common&quot;, or &quot;vulgar&quot;, this Spanish word, however, has lost its original meaning and carries no negative connotation among contemporary speakers.

For more information see the article on Chavacano, or the Ethnologue Report on Chavacano.

===Palenquero===
Palenquero (also Palenque) is a Spanish-based creole spoken in Colombia.

The ethnic group which speaks this creole consisted only of 2,500 people in 1989.

It is spoken in Colombia, in the village of San Basilio de Palenque which is south and east of Cartagena, and in some neighborhoods of Barranquilla.

The village was founded by fugitive slaves (Maroons) and Native Americans. Since many slaves had been only slightly exposed to contact with European people, the &quot;palenqueros&quot; spoke creole languages derived from Spanish and from their ancestral African languages.

Spanish speakers are unable to understand Palenquero. There is some influence from the Kongo language of the Democratic Republic of Congo. In 1998, only 10% of the population younger than 25 spoke Palenquero. It is most commonly spoken by the elderly.

For more information see the Ethnologue Report on Palenquero.

==Spanish-influenced creole languages==

===Annobonese Creole===
The Annobonese Creole, locally called Fa d&#x27;Ambö (Fa d&#x27;Ambu or even Fá d&#x27;Ambô) is a Portuguese-based creole, similar to Forro, with some borrowings from Spanish. It is spoken by 9,000 people on the islands of Ano Bom and Bioko, in Equatorial Guinea. In fact, Fa d&#x27;Ambu shares the same structure of Forro (82% of lexicon).

In the 15th century, the island was uninhabited and discovered by Portugal but, by the 18th century, Portugal exchanged it and some other territories in Africa for Uruguay with Spain. Spain wanted to get territory in Africa, and Portugal wanted to enlarge even more the territory that they saw as the &quot;New Portugal&quot; (Brazil). Nevertheless, the populace of Ano Bom was against the shift and was hostile toward the Spaniards. This hostility, combined with their isolation from mainland Equatorial Guinea and their proximity to São Tomé and Príncipe—just 400 km from the island—has assured the maintenance of its identity.

Fa d&#x27;Ambu has gained some words of Spanish origin (10% of lexicon), but some words are dubious in origin because Spanish and Portuguese are closely related languages.

===Papiamento===
Papiamento is spoken in the Dutch Caribbean. It is a Portuguese-based creole, with a large influence from Spanish, some influence from Dutch and a little from Indigenous American languages, English and African languages. Spoken in Aruba, Bonaire, Curaçao, by 341,300 people in 2019. It was made the official language, alongside Dutch and English, in 2007.

Today, the Venezuelan Spanish influence is very strong, especially on the Aruban dialect, but, due to the similarities between the Iberian Romance languages, it is difficult to ascertain whether a certain feature is derived from Portuguese or from Spanish.

===Pichinglis===
Pichinglis is spoken on Bioko island, Equatorial Guinea.
It originated with the arrival of Krio speakers from the mainland.
Krio is a creole that derives most of its vocabulary from English, but the Spanish colonization of Guinea exerted Spanish influence on its lexicon and grammar.

<text>The Euler angles are three angles introduced by Leonhard Euler to describe the orientation of a rigid body with respect to a fixed coordinate system.

They can also represent the orientation of a mobile frame of reference in physics or the orientation of a general basis in three dimensional linear algebra.

Classic Euler angles usually take the inclination angle in such a way that zero degrees represent the vertical orientation. Alternative forms were later introduced by Peter Guthrie Tait and George H. Bryan intended for use in aeronautics and engineering in which zero degrees represent the horizontal position.

==Chained rotations equivalence==

Euler angles can be defined by elemental geometry or by composition of rotations (i.e. chained rotations). The geometrical definition demonstrates that three composed &quot;elemental rotations&quot; (rotations about the axes of a coordinate system) are &quot;always&quot; sufficient to reach any target frame.

The three elemental rotations may be extrinsic (rotations about the axes &quot;xyz&quot; of the original coordinate system, which is assumed to remain motionless), or intrinsic (rotations about the axes of the rotating coordinate system &quot;XYZ&quot;, solidary with the moving body, which changes its orientation with respect to the extrinsic frame after each elemental rotation).

In the sections below, an axis designation with a prime mark superscript (e.g., &quot;z&quot;″) denotes the new axis after an elemental rotation.

Euler angles are typically denoted as &quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot;, &quot;γ&quot;, or &quot;ψ&quot;, &quot;θ&quot;, &quot;φ&quot;. Different authors may use different sets of rotation axes to define Euler angles, or different names for the same angles. Therefore, any discussion employing Euler angles should &quot;always&quot; be preceded by their definition.

Without considering the possibility of using two different conventions for the definition of the rotation axes (intrinsic or extrinsic), there exist twelve possible sequences of rotation axes, divided in two groups:

* Proper Euler angles 
* Tait–Bryan angles .

Tait–Bryan angles are also called Cardan angles; nautical angles; heading, elevation, and bank; or yaw, pitch, and roll. Sometimes, both kinds of sequences are called &quot;Euler angles&quot;. In that case, the sequences of the first group are called &quot;proper&quot; or &quot;classic&quot; Euler angles.

==Classic Euler angles==
The Euler angles are three angles introduced by Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler (1707–1783) to describe the orientation of a rigid body with respect to a fixed coordinate system.
===Geometrical definition===
The axes of the original frame are denoted as &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot; and the axes of the rotated frame as &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;Z&quot;. The geometrical definition (sometimes referred to as static) begins by defining the line of nodes (N) as the intersection of the planes &quot;xy&quot; and &quot;XY&quot; (it can also be defined as the common perpendicular to the axes &quot;z&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; and then written as the vector product &quot;N&quot; = &quot;z&quot; × &quot;Z&quot;). Using it, the three Euler angles can be defined as follows:

* formula_1 (or formula_2) is the signed angle between the &quot;x&quot; axis and the &quot;N&quot; axis (&quot;x&quot;-convention – it could also be defined between &quot;y&quot; and &quot;N&quot;, called &quot;y&quot;-convention).
* formula_3 (or formula_4) is the angle between the &quot;z&quot; axis and the &quot;Z&quot; axis.
* formula_5 (or formula_6) is the signed angle between the &quot;N&quot; axis and the &quot;X&quot; axis (&quot;x&quot;-convention).

Euler angles between two reference frames are defined only if both frames have the same handedness.

===Conventions by intrinsic rotations===
Intrinsic rotations are elemental rotations that occur about the axes of a coordinate system &quot;XYZ&quot; attached to a moving body. Therefore, they change their orientation after each elemental rotation. The &quot;XYZ&quot; system rotates, while &quot;xyz&quot; is fixed. Starting with &quot;XYZ&quot; overlapping &quot;xyz&quot;, a composition of three intrinsic rotations can be used to reach any target orientation for &quot;XYZ&quot;.

Euler angles can be defined by intrinsic rotations. The rotated frame &quot;XYZ&quot; may be imagined to be initially aligned with &quot;xyz&quot;, before undergoing the three elemental rotations represented by Euler angles. Its successive orientations may be denoted as follows:

* &quot;x&quot;-&quot;y&quot;-&quot;z&quot; or &quot;x&quot;0-&quot;y&quot;0-&quot;z&quot;0 (initial)
* &quot;x&quot;′-&quot;y&quot;′-&quot;z&quot;′ or &quot;x&quot;1-&quot;y&quot;1-&quot;z&quot;1 (after first rotation)
* &quot;x&quot;″-&quot;y&quot;″-&quot;z&quot;″ or &quot;x&quot;2-&quot;y&quot;2-&quot;z&quot;2 (after second rotation)
* &quot;X&quot;-&quot;Y&quot;-&quot;Z&quot; or &quot;x&quot;3-&quot;y&quot;3-&quot;z&quot;3 (final)

For the above-listed sequence of rotations, the line of nodes &quot;N&quot; can be simply defined as the orientation of &quot;X&quot; after the first elemental rotation. Hence, &quot;N&quot; can be simply denoted &quot;x&quot;′. Moreover, since the third elemental rotation occurs about &quot;Z&quot;, it does not change the orientation of &quot;Z&quot;. Hence &quot;Z&quot; coincides with &quot;z&quot;″. This allows us to simplify the definition of the Euler angles as follows:

* &quot;α&quot; (or &quot;φ&quot;) represents a rotation around the &quot;z&quot; axis,
* &quot;β&quot; (or &quot;θ&quot;) represents a rotation around the &quot;x&quot;′ axis, 
* &quot;γ&quot; (or &quot;ψ&quot;) represents a rotation around the &quot;z&quot;″ axis.

===Conventions by extrinsic rotations===
Extrinsic rotations are elemental rotations that occur about the axes of the fixed coordinate system &quot;xyz&quot;. The &quot;XYZ&quot; system rotates, while &quot;xyz&quot; is fixed. Starting with &quot;XYZ&quot; overlapping &quot;xyz&quot;, a composition of three extrinsic rotations can be used to reach any target orientation for &quot;XYZ&quot;. The Euler or Tait–Bryan angles (&quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot;, &quot;γ&quot;) are the amplitudes of these elemental rotations. For instance, the target orientation can be reached as follows (note the reversed order of Euler angle application):

* The &quot;XYZ&quot; system rotates about the &quot;z&quot; axis by &quot;γ&quot;. The &quot;X&quot; axis is now at angle &quot;γ&quot; with respect to the &quot;x&quot; axis.
* The &quot;XYZ&quot; system rotates again, but this time about the &quot;x&quot; axis by &quot;β&quot;. The &quot;Z&quot; axis is now at angle &quot;β&quot; with respect to the &quot;z&quot; axis.
* The &quot;XYZ&quot; system rotates a third time, about the &quot;z&quot; axis again, by angle &quot;α&quot;.

In sum, the three elemental rotations occur about &quot;z&quot;, &quot;x&quot; and &quot;z&quot;. Indeed, this sequence is often denoted &quot;z&quot;-&quot;x&quot;-&quot;z&quot; (or 3-1-3). Sets of rotation axes associated with both proper Euler angles and Tait–Bryan angles are commonly named using this notation (see above for details).

If each step of the rotation acts on the rotating coordinate system XYZ, the rotation is intrinsic (&quot;Z-X&#x27;-Z&quot;&quot;). &quot;Intrinsic&quot; rotation can also be denoted 3-1-3.

===Signs, ranges and conventions===
Angles are commonly defined according to the right-hand rule. Namely, they have positive values when they represent a rotation that appears clockwise when looking in the positive direction of the axis, and negative values when the rotation appears counter-clockwise. The opposite convention (left hand rule) is less frequently adopted.

About the ranges (using interval notation):

* for &quot;α&quot; and &quot;γ&quot;, the range is defined modulo 2 radians. For instance, a valid range could be .
* for &quot;β&quot;, the range covers radians (but can not be said to be modulo ). For example, it could be or .

The angles &quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot; and &quot;γ&quot; are uniquely determined except for the singular case that the &quot;xy&quot; and the &quot;XY&quot; planes are identical, i.e. when the &quot;z&quot; axis and the &quot;Z&quot; axis have the same or opposite directions. Indeed, if the &quot;z&quot; axis and the &quot;Z&quot; axis are the same, &quot;β&quot; = 0 and only (&quot;α&quot; + &quot;γ&quot;) is uniquely defined (not the individual values), and, similarly, if the &quot;z&quot; axis and the &quot;Z&quot; axis are opposite, &quot;β&quot; =  and only (&quot;α&quot; − &quot;γ&quot;) is uniquely defined (not the individual values). These ambiguities are known as gimbal lock in applications.

There are six possibilities of choosing the rotation axes for proper Euler angles. In all of them, the first and third rotation axes are the same. The six possible sequences are:
# &quot;z&quot;1-&quot;x&quot;′-&quot;z&quot;2″ (intrinsic rotations) or &quot;z&quot;2-&quot;x&quot;-&quot;z&quot;1 (extrinsic rotations)
# &quot;x&quot;1-&quot;y&quot;′-&quot;x&quot;2″ (intrinsic rotations) or &quot;x&quot;2-&quot;y&quot;-&quot;x&quot;1 (extrinsic rotations)
# &quot;y&quot;1-&quot;z&quot;′-&quot;y&quot;2″ (intrinsic rotations) or &quot;y&quot;2-&quot;z&quot;-&quot;y&quot;1 (extrinsic rotations)
# &quot;z&quot;1-&quot;y&quot;′-&quot;z&quot;2″ (intrinsic rotations) or &quot;z&quot;2-&quot;y&quot;-&quot;z&quot;1 (extrinsic rotations)
# &quot;x&quot;1-&quot;z&quot;′-&quot;x&quot;2″ (intrinsic rotations) or &quot;x&quot;2-&quot;z&quot;-&quot;x&quot;1 (extrinsic rotations)
# &quot;y&quot;1-&quot;x&quot;′-&quot;y&quot;2″ (intrinsic rotations) or &quot;y&quot;2-&quot;x&quot;-&quot;y&quot;1 (extrinsic rotations)

===Precession, nutation and intrinsic rotation===

Precession, nutation, and intrinsic rotation (spin) are defined as the movements obtained by changing one of the Euler angles while leaving the other two constant. These motions are not expressed in terms of the external frame, or in terms of the co-moving rotated body frame, but in a mixture. They constitute a mixed axes of rotation system, where the first angle moves the line of nodes around the external axis &quot;z&quot;, the second rotates around the line of nodes &quot;N&quot; and the third one is an intrinsic rotation around &quot;Z&quot;, an axis fixed in the body that moves.

The static definition implies that:

* &quot;α&quot; (precession) represents a rotation around the &quot;z&quot; axis,
* &quot;β&quot; (nutation) represents a rotation around the &quot;N&quot; or x′ axis, 
* &quot;γ&quot; (intrinsic rotation) represents a rotation around the &quot;Z&quot; or z″ axis.

If &quot;β&quot; is zero, there is no rotation about &quot;N&quot;. As a consequence, &quot;Z&quot; coincides with &quot;z&quot;, &quot;α&quot; and &quot;γ&quot; represent rotations about the same axis (&quot;z&quot;), and the final orientation can be obtained with a single rotation about &quot;z&quot;, by an angle equal to .

As an example, consider a top. The top spins around its own axis of symmetry; this corresponds to its intrinsic rotation. It also rotates around its pivotal axis, with its center of mass orbiting the pivotal axis; this rotation is a precession. Finally, the top can wobble up and down; the inclination angle is the nutation angle. The same example can be seen with the movements of the earth.

Though all three movements can be represented by a rotation operator with constant coefficients in some frame, they cannot be represented by these operators all at the same time. Given a reference frame, at most one of them will be coefficient-free. Only precession can be expressed in general as a matrix in the basis of the space without dependencies of the other angles.

These movements also behave as a gimbal set. Given a set of frames, able to move each with respect to the former according to just one angle, like a gimbal, there will exist an external fixed frame, one final frame and two frames in the middle, which are called &quot;intermediate frames&quot;. The two in the middle work as two gimbal rings that allow the last frame to reach any orientation in space.

==Tait–Bryan angles==

The second type of formalism is called Tait–Bryan angles, after Scottish mathematical physicist Peter Guthrie Tait (1831–1901) and English applied mathematician George H. Bryan (1864–1928). It is the convention normally used for aerospace applications, so that zero degrees elevation represents the horizontal attitude. Tait–Bryan angles represent the orientation of the aircraft with respect to the world frame. When dealing with other vehicles, different axes conventions are possible.

===Definitions===

The definitions and notations used for Tait–Bryan angles are similar to those described above for proper Euler angles (geometrical definition, intrinsic rotation definition, extrinsic rotation definition). The only difference is that Tait–Bryan angles represent rotations about three distinct axes (e.g. &quot;x&quot;-&quot;y&quot;-&quot;z&quot;, or &quot;x&quot;-&quot;y&quot;′-&quot;z&quot;″), while proper Euler angles use the same axis for both the first and third elemental rotations (e.g., &quot;z&quot;-&quot;x&quot;-&quot;z&quot;, or &quot;z&quot;-&quot;x&quot;′-&quot;z&quot;″).

This implies a different definition for the line of nodes in the geometrical construction. In the proper Euler angles case it was defined as the intersection between two homologous Cartesian planes (parallel when Euler angles are zero; e.g. &quot;xy&quot; and &quot;XY&quot;). In the Tait–Bryan angles case, it is defined as the intersection of two non-homologous planes (perpendicular when Euler angles are zero; e.g. &quot;xy&quot; and &quot;YZ&quot;).

===Conventions===
The three elemental rotations may occur either about the axes of the original coordinate system, which remains motionless (extrinsic rotations), or about the axes of the rotating coordinate system, which changes its orientation after each elemental rotation (intrinsic rotations).

There are six possibilities of choosing the rotation axes for Tait–Bryan angles. The six possible sequences are:

* &quot;x&quot;-&quot;y&quot;′-&quot;z&quot;″ (intrinsic rotations) or &quot;z&quot;-&quot;y&quot;-&quot;x&quot; (extrinsic rotations)
* &quot;y&quot;-&quot;z&quot;′-&quot;x&quot;″ (intrinsic rotations) or &quot;x&quot;-&quot;z&quot;-&quot;y&quot; (extrinsic rotations)
* &quot;z&quot;-&quot;x&quot;′-&quot;y&quot;″ (intrinsic rotations) or &quot;y&quot;-&quot;x&quot;-&quot;z&quot; (extrinsic rotations)
* &quot;x&quot;-&quot;z&quot;′-&quot;y&quot;″ (intrinsic rotations) or &quot;y&quot;-&quot;z&quot;-&quot;x&quot; (extrinsic rotations)
* &quot;z&quot;-&quot;y&quot;′-&quot;x&quot;″ (intrinsic rotations) or &quot;x&quot;-&quot;y&quot;-&quot;z&quot; (extrinsic rotations): the intrinsic rotations are known as: yaw, pitch and roll
* &quot;y&quot;-&quot;x&quot;′-&quot;z&quot;″ (intrinsic rotations) or &quot;z&quot;-&quot;x&quot;-&quot;y&quot; (extrinsic rotations)

===Signs and ranges===

Tait–Bryan convention is widely used in engineering with different purposes. There are several axes conventions in practice for choosing the mobile and fixed axes, and these conventions determine the signs of the angles. Therefore, signs must be studied in each case carefully.

The range for the angles &quot;ψ&quot; and &quot;φ&quot; covers 2 radians. For &quot;θ&quot; the range covers radians.

===Alternative names===
These angles are normally taken as one in the external reference frame (heading, bearing), one in the intrinsic moving frame (bank) and one in a middle frame, representing an elevation or inclination with respect to the horizontal plane, which is equivalent to the line of nodes for this purpose.

===As chained rotations===

For an aircraft, they can be obtained with three rotations around its principal axes if done in the proper order and starting from a frame coincident with the reference frame. 

* A yaw will obtain the bearing, 
* a pitch will yield the elevation, and
* a roll gives the bank angle. 

Therefore, in aerospace they are sometimes called yaw, pitch, and roll. Notice that this will not work if the rotations are applied in any other order or if the airplane axes start in any position non-equivalent to the reference frame.

Tait–Bryan angles, following &quot;z&quot;-&quot;y&quot;′-&quot;x&quot;″ (intrinsic rotations) convention, are also known as nautical angles, because they can be used to describe the orientation of a ship or aircraft, or Cardan angles, after the Italian mathematician and physicist Gerolamo Cardano, who first described in detail the Cardan suspension and the Cardan joint.

==Angles of a given frame==
A common problem is to find the Euler angles of a given frame. The fastest way to get them is to write the three given vectors as columns of a matrix and compare it with the expression of the theoretical matrix (see later table of matrices). Hence the three Euler Angles can be calculated. Nevertheless, the same result can be reached avoiding matrix algebra and using only elemental geometry. Here we present the results for the two most commonly used conventions: &quot;ZXZ&quot; for proper Euler angles and &quot;ZYX&quot; for Tait–Bryan. Notice that any other convention can be obtained just changing the name of the axes.

===Proper Euler angles===
Assuming a frame with unit vectors (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;Z&quot;) given by their coordinates as in the main diagram, it can be seen that:

:formula_7

And, since
:formula_8
for formula_9 we have
:formula_10

As formula_11 is the double projection of a unitary vector,
:formula_12
:formula_13

There is a similar construction for formula_14, projecting it first over the plane defined by the axis &quot;z&quot; and the line of nodes. As the angle between the planes is formula_15 and formula_16, this leads to:

:formula_17
:formula_18

and finally, using the inverse cosine function,

:formula_19
:formula_20
:formula_21

===Tait–Bryan angles===
Assuming a frame with unit vectors (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;Z&quot;) given by their coordinates as in this new diagram (notice that the angle theta is negative), it can be seen that:

:formula_22

As before,
:formula_23
for formula_24 we have
:formula_25

in a way analogous to the former one:

:formula_26
:formula_27

Looking for similar expressions to the former ones:

:formula_28
:formula_29
:formula_30

===Last remarks===
Note that the inverse sine and cosine functions yield two possible values for the argument. In this geometrical description, only one of the solutions is valid. When Euler angles are defined as a sequence of rotations, all the solutions can be valid, but there will be only one inside the angle ranges. This is because the sequence of rotations to reach the target frame is not unique if the ranges are not previously defined.

For computational purposes, it may be useful to represent the angles using . For example, in the case of proper Euler angles:

:formula_31
:formula_32

==Conversion to other orientation representations==
Euler angles are one way to represent orientations. There are others, and it is possible to change to and from other conventions. Three parameters are always required to describe orientations in a 3-dimensional Euclidean space. They can be given in several ways, Euler angles being one of them; see charts on SO(3) for others.

The most common orientation representations are the rotation matrices, the axis-angle and the quaternions, also known as Euler–Rodrigues parameters, which provide another mechanism for representing 3D rotations. This is equivalent to the special unitary group description.

Expressing rotations in 3D as unit quaternions instead of matrices has some advantages:

* Concatenating rotations is computationally faster and numerically more stable.
* Extracting the angle and axis of rotation is simpler.
* Interpolation is more straightforward. See for example slerp.
* Quaternions do not suffer from gimbal lock as Euler angles do.

Regardless, the rotation matrix calculation is the first step for obtaining the other two representations.

===Rotation matrix===
Any orientation can be achieved by composing three elemental rotations, starting from a known standard orientation. Equivalently, any rotation matrix &quot;R&quot; can be decomposed as a product of three elemental rotation matrices. For instance:
formula_33
is a rotation matrix that may be used to represent a composition of extrinsic rotations about axes &quot;z&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, (in that order), or a composition of intrinsic rotations about axes &quot;x&quot;-&quot;y&quot;′-&quot;z&quot;″ (in that order). However, both the definition of the elemental rotation matrices &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;Z&quot;, and their multiplication order depend on the choices taken by the user about the definition of both rotation matrices and Euler angles (see, for instance, Ambiguities in the definition of rotation matrices). Unfortunately, different sets of conventions are adopted by users in different contexts. The following table was built according to this set of conventions:

# Each matrix is meant to operate by pre-multiplying column vectors formula_34 (see Ambiguities in the definition of rotation matrices)
# Each matrix is meant to represent an active rotation (the composing and composed matrices are supposed to act on the coordinates of vectors defined in the initial fixed reference frame and give as a result the coordinates of a rotated vector defined in the same reference frame).
# Each matrix is meant to represent, primarily, a composition of intrinsic rotations (around the axes of the rotating reference frame) and, secondarily, the composition of three extrinsic rotations (which corresponds to the constructive evaluation of the R matrix by the multiplication of three truly elemental matrices, in reverse order).
# Right handed reference frames are adopted, and the right hand rule is used to determine the sign of the angles &quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot;, &quot;γ&quot;.
For the sake of simplicity, the following table of matrix products uses the following nomenclature:
# &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;Z&quot; are the matrices representing the elemental rotations about the axes &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot; of the fixed frame (e.g., &quot;X&quot;&quot;α&quot; represents a rotation about &quot;x&quot; by an angle &quot;α&quot;).
# &quot;s&quot; and &quot;c&quot; represent sine and cosine (e.g., &quot;s&quot;&quot;α&quot; represents the sine of &quot;α&quot;).

These tabular results are available in numerous textbooks. For each column the last row constitutes the most commonly used convention.

To change the formulas for passive rotations (or find reverse active rotation), transpose the matrices (then each matrix transforms the initial coordinates of a vector remaining fixed to the coordinates of the same vector measured in the rotated reference system; same rotation axis, same angles, but now the coordinate system rotates, rather than the vector).

The following table contains formulas for angles &quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot; and &quot;γ&quot; from elements of a rotation matrix formula_35.
==Properties==

The Euler angles form a chart on all of SO(3), the special orthogonal group of rotations in 3D space. The chart is smooth except for a polar coordinate style singularity along . See charts on SO(3) for a more complete treatment.

The space of rotations is called in general &quot;The Hypersphere of rotations&quot;, though this is a misnomer: the group Spin(3) is isometric to the hypersphere &quot;S&quot;3, but the rotation space SO(3) is instead isometric to the real projective space RP3 which is a 2-fold quotient space of the hypersphere. This 2-to-1 ambiguity is the mathematical origin of spin in physics.

A similar three angle decomposition applies to SU(2), the special unitary group of rotations in complex 2D space, with the difference that &quot;β&quot; ranges from 0 to 2. These are also called Euler angles.

The Haar measure for SO(3) in Euler angles is given by the Hopf angle parametrisation of SO(3), formula_36, where formula_37 parametrise formula_38, the space of rotation axes.

For example, to generate uniformly randomized orientations, let &quot;α&quot; and &quot;γ&quot; be uniform from 0 to 2, let &quot;z&quot; be uniform from −1 to 1, and let .

===Geometric algebra===
Other properties of Euler angles and rotations in general can be found from the geometric algebra, a higher level abstraction, in which the quaternions are an even subalgebra. The principal tool in geometric algebra is the rotor formula_39 where formula_40angle of rotation, formula_41 is the rotation axis (unitary vector) and formula_42 is the pseudoscalar (trivector in formula_43)

===Higher dimensions===
It is possible to define parameters analogous to the Euler angles in dimensions higher than three.
 In four dimensions and above, the concept of &quot;rotation about an axis&quot; loses meaning and instead becomes &quot;rotation in a plane.&quot; The number of Euler angles needed to represent the group is , equal to the number of planes containing two distinct coordinate axes in &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space.

In SO(4) a rotation matrix is defined by two unit quaternions, and therefore has six degrees of freedom, three from each quaternion.

==Applications==

===Vehicles and moving frames===

Their main advantage over other orientation descriptions is that they are directly measurable from a gimbal mounted in a vehicle. As gyroscopes keep their rotation axis constant, angles measured in a gyro frame are equivalent to angles measured in the lab frame. Therefore, gyros are used to know the actual orientation of moving spacecraft, and Euler angles are directly measurable. Intrinsic rotation angle cannot be read from a single gimbal, so there has to be more than one gimbal in a spacecraft. Normally there are at least three for redundancy. There is also a relation to the well-known gimbal lock problem of mechanical engineering.

When studying rigid bodies in general, one calls the &quot;xyz&quot; system &quot;space coordinates&quot;, and the &quot;XYZ&quot; system &quot;body coordinates&quot;. The space coordinates are treated as unmoving, while the body coordinates are considered embedded in the moving body. Calculations involving acceleration, angular acceleration, angular velocity, angular momentum, and kinetic energy are often easiest in body coordinates, because then the moment of inertia tensor does not change in time. If one also diagonalizes the rigid body&#x27;s moment of inertia tensor (with nine components, six of which are independent), then one has a set of coordinates (called the principal axes) in which the moment of inertia tensor has only three components.

The angular velocity of a rigid body takes a simple form using Euler angles in the moving frame. Also the Euler&#x27;s rigid body equations are simpler because the inertia tensor is constant in that frame.

===Crystallographic texture===

In materials science, crystallographic texture (or preferred orientation) can be described using Euler angles. In texture analysis, the Euler angles provide a mathematical depiction of the orientation of individual crystallites within a polycrystalline material, allowing for the quantitative description of the macroscopic material. 
The most common definition of the angles is due to Bunge and corresponds to the &quot;ZXZ&quot; convention. It is important to note, however, that the application generally involves axis transformations of tensor quantities, i.e. passive rotations. Thus the matrix that corresponds to the Bunge Euler angles is the transpose of that shown in the table above.

===Others===

Euler angles, normally in the Tait–Bryan convention, are also used in robotics for speaking about the degrees of freedom of a wrist. They are also used in electronic stability control in a similar way.

Gun fire control systems require corrections to gun-order angles (bearing and elevation) to compensate for deck tilt (pitch and roll). In traditional systems, a stabilizing gyroscope with a vertical spin axis corrects for deck tilt, and stabilizes the optical sights and radar antenna. However, gun barrels point in a direction different from the line of sight to the target, to anticipate target movement and fall of the projectile due to gravity, among other factors. Gun mounts roll and pitch with the deck plane, but also require stabilization. Gun orders include angles computed from the vertical gyro data, and those computations involve Euler angles.

Euler angles are also used extensively in the quantum mechanics of angular momentum. In quantum mechanics, explicit descriptions of the representations of SO(3) are very important for calculations, and almost all the work has been done using Euler angles. In the early history of quantum mechanics, when physicists and chemists had a sharply negative reaction towards abstract group theoretic methods (called the &quot;Gruppenpest&quot;), reliance on Euler angles was also essential for basic theoretical work.

Many mobile computing devices contain accelerometers which can determine these devices&#x27; Euler angles with respect to the earth&#x27;s gravitational attraction. These are used in applications such as games, bubble level simulations, and kaleidoscopes.

<text>A plunger is a device driven by or against fluid pressure. In plumbing, the term plunger commonly refers to handheld tools used to clear blockages in drains and pipes. Plumbing plungers consist of a rubber suction cup attached to a stick (&quot;shaft&quot;) usually made of wood or plastic. A different bellows-like design is usually constructed of plastic. Alternate names for plumbing plungers include &quot;force cup&quot;, &quot;plumber&#x27;s friend&quot; or &quot;plumber&#x27;s helper&quot;.

In musical performance, tools called plungers are used to mute trumpets and trombones. A plunger may also refer to a component of a device that generates fluid flow, such as in a medical syringe or a French press coffee brewer. 

== History ==
The plumbing plunger was invented in 1874 by New York confectioner John Hawley, with the flattened rim added in 1876. The invention is referred to in the patent as a &quot;vent-clearer&quot;, and was marketed as a &quot;force cup&quot;.

== Applications ==

=== Plumbing ===

==== Use ====
For the common plunger, the cup is pushed down against the drain opening, either pressing hard into the drain to force air in or pushing down until the rubber cup is flattened. The cup is then pulled out, creating a vacuum to pull blockage material upward and dislodge waste or other material. 

==== Shape and function ====
The cup of a kitchen plunger looks like a rubber ball cut in half with a flared edge, while the toilet plunger&#x27;s cup looks more like a distorted bowl, tapered on one half, with a large opening on the bottom.

A plunger is much more effective with water in the pipe, as water does not compress and thus transmits more of the applied force than does air. When a plunger alone is ineffective, it can be supplemented by a chemical drain cleaner for sinks and tubs; or a plumber&#x27;s snake for stubborn clogs, and clogs of the main line or toilet.

=== Syringes ===
In syringes, plungers are constrained to linear motion as they are pulled and pushed within an outer tube or &quot;barrel.&quot; The plunger allows the syringe to take in or expel fluid through an orifice at the open end of the barrel. In disposable syringes, the plunger is often made of plastic with a rubber tip that seals between itself and the barrel.

<text>The Potomac Company (spelled variously as Patowmack, Potowmack, Potowmac, and Compony) was created in 1785 to make improvements to the Potomac River and improve its navigability for commerce. The project is perhaps the first conceptual seed planted in the minds of the new American capitalists in what became a flurry of transportation infrastructure projects, most privately funded, that drove wagon road turnpikes, navigations, and canals, and then as the technology developed, investment funds for railroads across the rough country of the Appalachian Mountains. 

In a few decades, the eastern seaboard was crisscrossed by private turnpikes and canals were being built from Massachusetts to Illinois ushering in the brief seven decades of the American Canal Age. The Potomac Company&#x27;s achievement was not just to be an early example, but of being significant also in size and scope of the project, which involved taming a mountain stream fed river with icing conditions and unpredictable freshets (floods).

==Geography==
The Potomac Company built five skirting canals around the major falls of the Potomac opening the river to commercial bulk goods traffic from the Chesapeake Bay mouth to Cumberland, Maryland in the Cumberland Narrows notch leading west across the Alleghenies, where it intersected Nemacolin&#x27;s Trail near Braddock&#x27;s Road, later made the first National Road, today&#x27;s U.S. Route 40. 

When completed, bulk goods could ship by wagon out of the Pennsylvania and Virginia Alleghenies plateau country downhill to the river port where the canal allowed boats and rafts to float downstream towards Georgetown, a significant port of the time on the Potomac River, now an upscale bedroom community and college town within the District of Columbia. The company had been championed by prominent men of both Maryland and Virginia, including George Washington, who was its first president, as well as an investor in the company. Tobias Lear, Washington&#x27;s personal secretary, was its chairman for a period. Other principals of the company included Thomas Johnson of Maryland.

==History==

The Potomac Company&#x27;s charter stated that its goal was linking the East Coastwith the Old Northwest, including the Ohio Country, by building a canal up through a water gap through the Allegheny Front into the nearer frontiers connecting to the headwaters of either the Ohio River tributaries, the Cheat, or Monongahela Rivers. It had an early and more immediate goal of improving the navigability of the Potomac River, by building canals and navigations around a succession of blocking rapids or falls of the lower and middle Potomac River. In this latter goal, it succeeded. 

The larger endeavor, connecting coastal communities with the blossoming trans-Allegheny settlements, was championed by Benjamin Franklin and other Founding Fathers, and became a pet project for the nation&#x27;s first president, George Washington, who had experience on West Virginia and Western Pennsylvania from his days as frontier surveyor and militia officer and saw these regions ultimately fail due to insufficient capitalization, an unstable American economy, a lack of sufficient investors, a lack of government aid from a poor and young federal government, and conflicts between states. Although the company charter was surrendered to the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company in 1828, its curtailment has overall minor significance only as in that it serves as an example of how a deficient amount of support from the responsible leadership balancing the federal government can seem to undermine a large, desirable infrastructure project that is a conceptual overreach, or could attract sufficient private funding. Its apparent failure, on the other hand, can be understood as a project which gave way to a superior technology, as railways came along and grew up before the slow subscription system of stocks common to the day attracted sufficient funding. In the day, men of means and many such officials of the early Federalist U.S. government were very conscious of the desirable effects of building transportation infrastructure to link the near west and tie it to the eastern seaboard. As settlers poured west over the mountains after the Revolutionary War, serious concerns arose that newly settled lands would become financially tied better to and so make arrangements with Spanish, French, or British colonies to the west, south, and Canada, and given a look at water communication, the risk was very real. Hence, from the start, the fledgling Constitutional Republic was conscience of benefits that could accrue from its involvement in developing infrastructure in the fledgling republic but was unable to generate revenues to boost such efforts. The rare exception in the era receiving federal public works monies was over a decade later and deemed far less risky, the Cumberland Turnpike conversion into a migration wagon road and the first National Highway, later to become US 40.

While slim flat bottom river boats called bateaux could be poled up-river in even the shallowest of waters, they could not traverse the fall line, the area where an upland region (continental bedrock) and a coastal plain (coastal alluvia) meet, typically in waterfalls or cascades of successive rapids.

One of the major constructions of the Potomac Company was the Patowmack Canal. A major engineering feat of the time, the Potomack Canal permitted boats to navigate around Great Falls, where the Potomac River drops a treacherous 75 feet through the unnavigable Mather Gorge.

After 21 years, the Potomack Canal was sold, along with the other assets of the Potomac Company to the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company, which built a canal on the opposite, Maryland side of the Potomac River.
As early as 1749 many leaders in Maryland and Virginia had been interested in making the Potomac River into a major transportation route to the trans-Appalachian West. Advocates included Philadelphia resident Ben Franklin, who advocated many other waterway improvements as well as being vital to develop American industries and enhance trade with the interior frontiers of the days before the French and Indian War to combat the influence of New France (in Pennsylvania and) across the Appalachians. The project to improve the Potomac was seen as a major opportunity strategically (it would transport troops to the frontier with the French or the Indians more rapidly) and economically (it would increase fur trade and improve real estate values). A lack of technology, a severe shortage of labor, conflicts with foreign and colonial powers, and internal rivalries would prevent the project from being started until the 1780s, thirty years later.

In 1784, a year after the Treaty of Paris was signed, George Washington and Horatio Gates traveled to Annapolis to seek the state&#x27;s assent to the project. Washington urged Virginia Governor Benjamin Harrison to bring the matter to the Virginia Assembly, citing the &quot;commercial and political importance&quot; of the project. Washington&#x27;s formidable reputation in the U.S. during the time after the Revolution persuaded the governor to present a letter to the Virginia Assembly asking for support for the project. The Virginia Assembly appointed Washington, Gates, and Thomas Blackburn commissioners to seek Maryland&#x27;s agreement. Washington&#x27;s subsequent visit to Annapolis was successful and led to the incorporation of the Potomac Company in 1784 Maryland and 1785 in Virginia. These meetings would continue and have a major impact on national development as the navigations on the Potomac were in regular use supporting coal from Cumberland to Georgetown until 1929; in 1908 the Inland Waterways Commission notes the following significance:

While it was not the first or only project started after the end of the American Revolution, its incorporation was a milestone because it was the first project that connected different regions and required the cooperation of multiple state governments. While the Potomac Company&#x27;s charter eventually failed, the Maryland and Virginia acts of incorporation were very similar—the company stated it was going to raise 220,000 Spanish dollars (50, 000 pounds sterling) through 500 shares and also stated its plan and timeline. In the charter, the Potomac Company had three years to clear the upper Potomac, and ten years to build bypass canals and locks around the Little and Great Falls (a distance of 175 miles). Both states passed additional laws to go further—building roads and connecting headwaters to link the Potomac River to the Ohio River.

The Potomac Company originally wanted to hire only free labor, but due to the shortage of labor, the directors hired free, indentured, and slave labor to build the locks and canals and deepen the river. James Rumsey, well known for his work with steam-propelled riverboats, was hired as the project&#x27;s chief engineer.

There was a large conflict with Virginia Governor Henry Lee III (father of Robert E. Lee), who purchased of land around Great Falls (he named it &quot;Matildaville&quot; after his wife) to build a warehouse for goods being transported down the Potomac (predicting the route would quickly become profitable after the project&#x27;s completion). The legal troubles of the Potomac Company kept its lawyers in and out of court constantly.

The decline in public confidence in the project led to a more difficult economic position because the Potomac Company relied on individually buying shares for funds. Maryland and Virginia continued funding the Potomac Company&#x27;s project beyond the original contract. However even continued investment by Maryland, Virginia, and some individuals could not offset growing expenses due to poor technical advice, labor problems, poor planning, and incessant repair work. The work was stop and go because of the continuous need to raise more money. At many points in the project&#x27;s history (for example in) all work would stop as the company begged for economic assistance, settled lawsuits, and revised its plan.

Three of the canals, at Seneca Falls, House Falls (near Harpers Ferry), and Payne&#x27;s Falls (Shenandoah) did not need locks, and were completed. The Little Falls canal was more difficult, and as a money-saving measure, wooden locks were used.

In February 1802, the locks at Great Falls were completed, and the Potomac Company was expected to be immediately profitable. Also in 1802, the Patowmack Canal was completed after 17 years of construction. However, the poor snow in the winter of 1801-1802 and little spring rain in 1802 meant the river was too shallow to navigate that year. The late realization of these unanticipated problems caused the company to give up its earlier goal to link the Potomac and the Ohio Valley, and the new goal was to improve other rivers in the watershed such as the Shenandoah, the Monocacy, and Antietam Creek. At Harpers Ferry, Virginia (since 1863, West Virginia) the Company built the Shenandoah Canal in the Shenandoah River, creating Virginius Island, an industrial center.

A commission in 1821 agreed that water transport in the Potomac valley would only be possible with a still-water canal, and the Potomac Company announced it could not fulfill its charter. Virginia created the Potomac Canal Company. Maryland incorporated the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company in 1825, and Congress quickly approved its charter.

In 1817, fellow directors elected John Mason of Analostan Island, and son of President Washington&#x27;s mentor and fellow Founding Father George Mason IV as director. This last president served for eleven years before the corporation&#x27;s assets were merged into the more successful Chesapeake and Ohio Canal.

==Economic impact==
The failure of the Potomac Company to make the Potomac River navigable does not mean that that project was without serious economic implications. The failure of the Potomac Company was largely attributed to a lack of federal support and oversight, and the U.S. government was much more careful to support interstate infrastructure projects after that. The significance of transportation in such a large country cannot be understated, and the failure of such a large project made clear that expensive (but in the long term, profitable) infrastructure projects would not be achieved without support from the federal government.

Further, the Potomac Company&#x27;s plan made it possible for the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company to take over and complete the project. These two regions were linked, and goods and services moved through the Potomac for nearly a century.

==Legacy==
In his will, Washington left fifty shares toward the endowment of a university in the District of Columbia. The shares were lost, however.

The Potomac Company, an investment bank based in Philadelphia, is not related in any way to the original Potomac Company referenced above.

<text>Halldór Ásgrímsson (pronounced ; 8 September 1947 – 18 May 2015) was an Icelandic politician, who served as prime minister of Iceland from 15 September 2004 to 15 June 2006 and was the leader of the Progressive Party from 1994 to 2006.

==Education and early life==
Halldór studied at the Co-operative College in Bifröst, and became a certified public accountant in 1970. He later completed graduate commerce studies at the Universities of Bergen and Copenhagen, and worked as a lecturer at the University of Iceland from 1973 to 1975.

==Political career==
He represented the Eastern constituency as a member of the Althing (Icelandic Parliament) from 1974 to 1978 and from 1979 to 2003, when he was elected to represent the Reykjavík North constituency. Over the years, he has served in a large number of ministerial portfolios, namely as Minister of Fisheries from 1983 to 1991, Minister of Justice and Ecclesiastical Affairs from 1988 to 1989, Minister for Nordic Cooperation from 1985 to 1987 and 1995 to 1999 and Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1995 to 2004. As Minister of Foreign Affairs, Halldór put Iceland on the Coalition of the Willing, the alliance supporting the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

Halldór took over as prime minister on 15 September 2004, succeeding Independence Party leader Davíð Oddsson, while Davíð replaced Halldór as Foreign Minister.

On 5 June 2006, following poor results for his party in the 2006 Icelandic municipalities elections, Halldór announced his resignation as prime minister and stated that he intended to step down as leader of the Progressive Party in August 2006, and leave politics all together. Geir H. Haarde, the Foreign Minister of Iceland, succeeded him on 15 June 2006.

Halldór Ásgrímsson&#x27;s successor as Progressive Party leader was Jón Sigurðsson, Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism, who was elected at the party&#x27;s convention in August 2006. At the convention Halldór ended his political career with an emotional and dynamic farewell speech to the party. Halldór resigned as MP after the convention; he was the longest serving MP at the time.

On 31 October 2006, Halldór was chosen as the Secretary-General of the Nordic Council of Ministers. Halldór Ásgrímsson was an Honorary Member of The International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation. 

He died of a heart attack at a Reykjavík hospital in May 2015. His casket was carried by prime minister, Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson and his long-life partner, Davíð Oddsson.

<text>Student-centered learning, also known as learner-centered education, broadly encompasses methods of teaching that shift the focus of instruction from the teacher to the student. In original usage, student-centered learning aims to develop learner autonomy and independence by putting responsibility for the learning path in the hands of students by imparting to them skills, and the basis on how to learn a specific subject and schemata required to measure up to the specific performance requirement. Student-centered instruction focuses on skills and practices that enable lifelong learning and independent problem-solving. Student-centered learning theory and practice are based on the constructivist learning theory that emphasizes the learner&#x27;s critical role in constructing meaning from new information and prior experience.

Student-centered learning puts students&#x27; interests first, acknowledging student voice as central to the learning experience. In a student-centered learning space, students choose what they will learn, how they will pace their learning, and how they will assess their own learning by playing the role of the facilitator of the classroom. This is in contrast to traditional education, also dubbed &quot;teacher-centered learning&quot;, which situates the teacher as the primarily &quot;active&quot; role while students take a more &quot;passive&quot;, receptive role. In a teacher-centered classroom, teachers choose what the students will learn, how the students will learn, and how the students will be assessed on their learning. In contrast, student-centered learning requires students to be active, responsible participants in their own learning and with their own pace of learning.

Usage of the term &quot;student-centered learning&quot; may also simply refer to educational mindsets or instructional methods that recognize individual differences in learners. In this sense, student-centered learning emphasizes each student&#x27;s interests, abilities, and learning styles, placing the teacher as a facilitator of learning for individuals rather than for the class as a whole.

==Background==

Theorists like John Dewey, Jean Piaget and Lev Vygotsky, whose collective work focused on how students learn, have informed the move to student-centered learning. Dewey was an advocate for progressive education, and he believed that learning is a social and experiential process by making learning an active process as children learn by doing. He believed that a classroom environment in which students could learn to think critically and solve real world problems was the best way to prepare learners for the future.

Carl Rogers&#x27;s ideas about the formation of the individual also contributed to student-centered learning. Rogers wrote that &quot;the only learning which significantly influences behavior [and education] is self discovered&quot;. Maria Montessori was also a forerunner of student-centered learning, where preschool children learn through independent self-directed interaction with previously presented activities.

Self-determination theory focuses on the degree to which an individual&#x27;s behavior is self-motivated and &#x27;self-determined&#x27;. When students are allowed to gauge their learning, learning becomes an incentive, thus more meaningful. Placing students at the center of the classroom allows them to gauge their own self-worth which creates a higher degree of intrinsic motivation.

Student-centered learning means inverting the traditional teacher-centered understanding of the learning process and putting students at the center of the learning process. In the &quot;teacher-centered&quot; classroom, teachers are the primary source for knowledge. On the other hand, in &quot;student-centered&quot; classrooms, active learning is strongly encouraged. Armstrong (2012) claimed that &quot;traditional education ignores or suppresses learner responsibility&quot;.

A further distinction from a teacher-centered classroom to that of a student-centered classroom is when the teacher acts as a facilitator, as opposed to an instructor. In essence, the teacher&#x27;s goal in the learning process is to guide students into making new interpretations of the learning material, thereby &#x27;experiencing&#x27; content, reaffirming Rogers&#x27; notion that &quot;significant learning is acquired through doing&quot;.

Through peer-to-peer interaction, collaborative thinking can lead to an abundance of knowledge. In placing a teacher closer to a peer level, knowledge and learning is enhanced, benefitting the student and classroom overall. According to Lev Vygotsky&#x27;s theory of the zone of proximal development (ZPD), students typically learn vicariously through one another. Scaffolding is important when fostering independent thinking skills. Vygotsky proclaims, &quot;Learning which is oriented toward developmental levels that have already been reached is ineffective from the viewpoint of the child&#x27;s overall development. It does not aim for a new stage of the developmental process, but rather lags behind this process.&quot;

==Student-centered assessment==
One of the most critical differences between student-centered learning and teacher-centered learning is in assessment. Student-centered learning typically involves more formative assessment and less summative assessment than teacher-centered learning. In student-centered learning, students participate in the evaluation of their learning. This means that students are involved in deciding how to demonstrate their learning. Developing assessment that supports learning and motivation is essential to the success of student-centered approaches.

==Application to Elementary and Secondary Education==
In the U.S. the principles of student-centered instruction have been promoted as a way to improve engagement and boost achievement through their inclusion in the Common Core. Student-centered instruction has been shown to be related to increased mathematics engagement. Additionally, there is evidence that using student-centered instruction raises mathematics achievement.

==Application to higher education==
Student-centered learning environments have been shown to be effective in higher education. They have been defined specifically within higher education as both a mindset and a culture within a given educational institution and as a learning approach broadly related to, and supported by, constructivist theories of learning. They are characterised by innovative methods of teaching which aim to promote learning in communication with teachers and other learners and which take students seriously as active participants in their own learning and foster transferable skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and reflective thinking. The revised European Standards and Guidelines for Quality Assurance (ESG) approved by the Ministerial Conference in Yerevan on 15 May 2015 include the following passage on student-centred learning: &quot;Institutions should ensure that the programmes are delivered in a way that encourages students to take an active role in creating the learning process, and [should ensure] that the assessment of students reflects this approach.&quot;

A research university in Hong Kong sought to promote student-centered learning across the entire university by employing the following methods:
* Analysis of good practice by award-winning teachers, in all faculties, to show how they made use of active forms of student learning.
* Subsequent use of the analysis to promote wider use of good practice.
* A compulsory teacher training course for new junior teachers, which encouraged student-centered learning.
* Projects funded through teaching development grants, of which 16 were concerned with the introduction of active learning experiences.
* A program-level quality enhancement initiative that utilized a student survey to identify strengths and potential areas for improvement.
* Development of a model of a broadly based teaching and learning environment influencing the development of generic capabilities to provide evidence of the need for an interactive learning environment.
* The introduction of program reviews as a quality assurance measure.

The success of this initiative was evaluated by surveying the students. After two years, the mean ratings indicating the students&#x27; perception of the quality of the teaching and learning environment at the university all rose significantly. The study is one of many examining the process of implementing student-centered pedagogies in large institutions of higher education.

<doc id="411512" wikidata="Q1784385" url="?curid=411512" title="Cymatics">
<text>Cymatics (from ) is a subset of modal vibrational phenomena. The term was coined by Swiss physician Hans Jenny (1904–1972). Typically the surface of a plate, diaphragm, or membrane is vibrated, and regions of maximum and minimum displacement are made visible in a thin coating of particles, paste, or liquid. Different patterns emerge in the excitatory medium depending on the geometry of the plate and the driving frequency.

The apparatus employed can be simple, such as the Chinese spouting bowl, in which copper handles are rubbed and cause the copper bottom elements to vibrate. Other examples include the Chladni plate and the so-called cymascope.

==History==
On July 8, 1680, Robert Hooke was able to see the nodal patterns associated with the modes of vibration of glass plates. Hooke ran a bow along the edge of a glass plate covered with flour, and saw the nodal patterns emerge.

The German musician and physicist Ernst Chladni noticed in the eighteenth century that the modes of vibration of a membrane or a plate can be observed by sprinkling the vibrating surface with a fine dust (e.g., lycopodium powder, flour or fine sand). The powder moves due to the vibration and accumulates progressively in points of the surface corresponding to the sound vibration. The points form a pattern of lines, known as &quot;nodal lines of the vibration mode&quot;. The normal modes of vibration, and the pattern of nodal lines associated with each of these, are completely determined, for a surface with homogeneous mechanical characteristics, from the geometric shape of the surface and by the way in which the surface is constrained.

Experiments of this kind, similar to those carried out earlier by Galileo Galilei around 1630 and by Robert Hooke in 1680, were later perfected by Chladni, who introduced them systematically in 1787 in his book &quot;Entdeckungen über die Theorie des Klanges&quot; (Discoveries on the theory of sound). This provided an important contribution to the understanding of acoustic phenomena and the functioning of musical instruments. The figures thus obtained (with the aid of a violin bow that rubbed perpendicularly along the edge of smooth plates covered with fine sand) are still designated by the name of &quot;Chladni figures&quot;.

==Work of Hans Jenny==
In 1967 Hans Jenny, a student of the anthroposophist Rudolf Steiner, published the first of two volumes in German entitled &quot;Kymatic&quot;; the second was published posthumously in 1972.) In 2001, MACROmedia Publishing created a composite of these two volumes in English. Quite recently, in March 2024, they reissued an extensively revised version of this composite edition with notes and commentaries by leading experts in the fields of acoustics, the arts, and sound therapies.) He showed the evolution of harmonic images by subjecting inert substances to oscillating sound waves. His substantial body of work based on rigorous scientific methodology, developed Chladni&#x27;s experiments, highlighting intricate, organic, harmonic images that reflected many universal patterns found throughout nature and especially living organisms. Jenny spread powders, pastes, and liquids on a metal plate connected to an oscillator which could produce a broad spectrum of frequencies. The substances were organized into different structures characterized by geometric shapes typical of the frequency of the vibration emitted by the oscillator. According to Jenny, these structures, reminiscent of the mandala and other forms recurring in nature, would be a manifestation of an invisible force field of the vibrational energy that generated it. He was particularly impressed by an observation that imposing a vocalization in ancient Sanskrit of &quot;Om&quot; (regarded by Hindus and Buddhists as the sound of creation) the lycopodium powder formed a circle with a centre point, one of the ways in which &quot;Om&quot; had been represented.

In fact, for a plate of circular shape, resting in the centre (or the border, or at least in a set of points with central symmetry), the nodal vibration modes all have central symmetry, so the observation of Jenny is entirely consistent with well known mathematical properties. From the physical-mathematical standpoint, the form of the nodal patterns is predetermined by the shape of the body set in vibration or, in the case of acoustic waves in a gas, the shape of the cavity in which the gas is contained. The sound wave, therefore, does not influence at all the shape of the vibrating body or the shape of the nodal patterns. The only thing that changes due to the vibration is the arrangement of the sand. The image formed by the sand, in turn, is influenced by the frequency spectrum of the vibration only because each vibration mode is characterized by a specific frequency. Therefore, the spectrum of the signal that excites the vibration determines which patterns are actually nodally displayed. The physical phenomena involved in the formation of Chladni figures are best explained by classical physics.

==Influences on art and music==
Devices for displaying nodal images have influenced visual arts and contemporary music. Artist Björk created projections of cymatics patterns by using bass frequencies on tour for her album &quot;Biophilia&quot;. Similarly, painter and musician Perry Hall uses vibrations from an electric bass to create cymatic patterns in tanks of paint, which he films (the Sound Drawings). 

Hans Jenny&#x27;s book on Chladni figures influenced Alvin Lucier and helped lead to Lucier&#x27;s composition &quot;Queen of the South&quot;. Jenny&#x27;s work was also followed up by Center for Advanced Visual Studies (CAVS) founder György Kepes at MIT. His work in this area included an acoustically vibrated piece of sheet metal in which small holes had been drilled in a grid. Small flames of gas burned through these holes and thermodynamic patterns were made visible by this setup.

In the mid-1980s, visual artist Ron Rocco, who also developed his work at CAVS, employed mirrors mounted to tiny servo motors, driven by the audio signal of a synthesizer and amplified by a tube amp to reflect the beam of a laser. This created light patterns which corresponded to the audio&#x27;s frequency and amplitude. Using this beam to generate video feedback and computers to process the feedback signal, Rocco created his &quot;Andro-media&quot; series of installations. Rocco later formed a collaboration with musician David Hykes, who practiced a form of Mongolian overtone chanting with The Harmonic Choir, to generate cymatic images from a pool of liquid mercury, which functioned as a liquid mirror to modulate the beam of a Helium-Neon laser from the sound thus generated. Photographs of this work can be found in the Ars Electronica catalog of 1987.

Contemporary German photographer and philosopher Alexander Lauterwasser has brought cymatics into the 21st century using finely crafted crystal oscillators to resonate steel plates covered with fine sand and to vibrate small samples of water in Petri dishes. His first book, &quot;Water Sound Images&quot;, translated into English in 2006, features imagery of light reflecting off the surface of water set into motion by sound sources ranging from pure sine waves to music by Beethoven, Karlheinz Stockhausen, electroacoustic group &quot;Kymatik&quot; (who often record in ambisonic surround sound) and overtone singing. The resulting photographs of standing wave patterns are striking. Lauterwasser&#x27;s book focused on creating detailed visual analogues of natural patterns ranging from the distribution of spots on a leopard to the geometric patterns found in plants and flowers, to the shapes of jellyfish and the intricate patterns found on the shell of a tortoise.

Composer Stuart Mitchell and his father T.J. Mitchell claimed that Rosslyn Chapel&#x27;s carvings supposedly contain references to cymatics patterns. In 2005 they created a work called &quot;The Rosslyn Motet&quot; realised by attempting to match various Chladni patterns to 13 geometric symbols carved onto the faces of cubes emanating from 14 arches.

The musical group The Glitch Mob used cymatics to produce the music video &quot;Becoming Harmonious (ft. Metal Mother)&quot;.

Influenced by yantra diagrams and cymatics, artist and fashion designer Mandali Mendrilla created a sculpture dress called &quot;Kamadhenu&quot; (Wish Tree Dress III) the pattern of which is based
on a Yantra diagram depicting goddess Kamadhenu.

Aphex Twin suggests learning more about cymatics in reference to &#x27;master tuning of 440 Hz&#x27; in a conversation with synth-maker Tatsuya Takahashi.

Since 2010, the art collective Analema Group creates participatory performances in which cymatic patterns are produced digitally in real-time by the audience.

In 2014 musician Nigel Stanford produced &quot;Cymatics&quot;, an instrumental and music video designed to demonstrate the visual aspects of cymatics.

In 2016 songwriter and former Arizona State Quarterback Samson Szakacsy created &quot;The Drawing Machine&quot; by turning a subwoofer over face up, with thick paper on top and paint pens hanging overhead from fishing wire, as the vibration of his songs to moved the pens to produce fractal-like flower patterns. He then brought the Drawing Machine on tour and had each set draw live to portray how music looks. This cymatics demonstration can be viewed in this video.

Contemporary American painter Jimmy O&#x27;Neal created his own cymascope, which he has used to produce various works of public art. One such painting is 511.95 Hz of wine, a large-scale mural based on the pattern created when tracing a finger around the rim of a nearly-empty wine glass.

In 2020 an official medal was issued by the Royal Dutch Mint to mark the 65th anniversary of the Eurovision Song Contest hosted by the city of Rotterdam . A 3D scanner was able to capture the cymatics shapes of a vibrating dish filled with water from the Maas river. To create the coin, all the historical winning songs from previous contests were mixed together and emitted through a speaker.video,

The logo and theme art for Eurovision 2022 is based on cymatics.

The main title sequence for &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power&quot; is inspired by cymatics.

==Influences in engineering==
Inspired by periodic and symmetrical patterns at the air-liquid interface created by sound vibration, P. Chen and coworkers developed a method to engineer diverse structures from microscale materials using liquid-based templates. This liquid-based template can be dynamically reconfigured by tuning vibration frequency and acceleration.

<doc id="411523" wikidata="Q1665554" url="?curid=411523" title="List of Intel chipsets">
<text>This article provides a list of motherboard chipsets made by Intel, divided into three main categories: those that use the PCI bus for interconnection (the 4xx series), those that connect using specialized &quot;hub links&quot; (the 8xx series), and those that connect using PCI Express (the 9xx series). The chipsets are listed in chronological order.

== Pre-chipset situation ==
An earlier chipset support for Intel 8085 microprocessor can be found at MCS-85 family section.

Early IBM XT-compatible mainboards did not yet have a chipset, but relied instead on a collection of discrete TTL chips by Intel:
* the 8284 clock generator
* the 8288 bus controller
* the 8254 programmable interval timer
* the 8255 parallel I/O interface
* the 8259 programmable interrupt controller
* the 8237 DMA controller
==Early chipsets==
To integrate the functions needed on a mainboard into a smaller number of ICs, Intel licensed the ZyMOS POACH chipset for its Intel 80286 and Intel 80386SX processors (the 82230/82231 High Integration AT-Compatible Chip Set). The 82230 covers this combination of chips: 82C284 clock, 82288 bus controller, and dual 8259A interrupt controllers among with other components. The 82231 covers this combination of chips: 8254 interrupt timer, 74LS612 memory mapper and dual 8237A DMA controller among with other components. Both set were available US$60 for 10 MHz version and US$90 for 12 MHz version in quantities of 100. This chipset can be used with an 82335 High-integration Interface Device to provide support for the Intel 386SX.

[1] The 975X chipset supports only ×16 PCI Express (electrically) in the top slot when the slot below it is unpopulated. Otherwise it and the lower slot (both attached to the Memory Controller Hub) operate at ×8 electrically.

[2] Only later revisions of the 975X chipset boards support Core 2 processors. See MSI 975X Platinum (MS-7246) rev 1.0 (first release), and MSI 975X Platinum Powerup revision (MS-7246) rev 2.1 (released autumn 2006) as example. source: https://web.archive.org/web/20210515170458/http://ixbtlabs.com/articles2/mainboard/msi-975x-platinum-powerup-edition-i975x.html 
Officially 975X supports a maximum of 1066 MT/s FSB. Unofficially, third-party motherboards (Asus, Gigabyte) support certain 1333FSB 45 nm Core2 processors, usually with later BIOS updates.
As for Celeron and Celeron D support, some boards and revisions support it, some not. (see upper example, MSI Powerup Edition has reintroduced back Celeron support, probably due to later released Core2-based Celerons, which were often more powerful than higher clocked Netburst Pentiums 4.

[3] The 975X chipset technical specification shows only DDR2-533/667 memory support. Actual implementations of 975X do support DDR2 800.

[4] VT-d is inherently supported on these chipsets, but may not be enabled by individual OEMs. &quot;Always&quot; read the motherboard manual and check for BIOS updates. X38/X48 VT-d support is limited to certain Intel, Supermicro, DFI (LanParty) and Tyan boards. VT-d is broken or non existent on some boards until the BIOS is updated. Note that VT-d is a chipset Memory Controller Hub technology, not a processor feature, but this is complicated by later processor generations (Core i3/i5/i7) moving the MCH from the motherboard to the processor package, making only certain I series CPUs support VT-d.
===Core 2 mobile chipsets===

* 1 Unofficially this chipset support 5 GB.
* 2 Officially only 4 GB is supported. Unofficially many laptops with this chipset support 8 GB.
* 3 Low power mode, HD playback mode and Full performance mode respectively.

===Southbridge 9xx and 3/4 Series chipsets===

==5/6/7/8/9 Series chipsets==
The Nehalem microarchitecture moves the memory controller into the processor. For high-end Nehalem processors, the X58 IOH acts as a bridge from the QPI to PCI Express peripherals and DMI to the ICH10 southbridge. For mainstream and lower-end Nehalem processors, the integrated memory controller (IMC) is an entire northbridge (some even having GPUs), and the PCH (Platform Controller Hub) acts as a southbridge.

===LGA 1156===

Chipsets supporting LGA 1156 CPUs (Lynnfield and Clarkdale).

Not listed below is the 3450 chipset (see Xeon chipsets) which is compatible with Nehalem mainstream and high-end processors but does not claim core iX-compatibility. With either a Core i5 or i3 processor, the 3400-series chipsets enable the ECC functionality of unbuffered ECC memory. Otherwise these chipsets do not enable unbuffered ECC functionality.

===LGA 1155===

Chipsets supporting LGA 1155 CPUs (Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge). The PCIe 2.0 lanes from the PCH ran at 5 GT/s in this series, unlike in the previous LGA 1156 chips.

The Cougar Point Intel 6 series chipsets with stepping B2 were recalled due to a hardware bug that causes their 3 Gbit/s Serial ATA to degrade over time until they become unusable. Stepping B3 of the Intel 6 series chipsets will have the fix for this. The Z68 chipset which supports CPU overclocking and use of the integrated graphics does not have this hardware bug, however all other ones with B2 did. The Z68 also added support for transparently caching hard disk data on to solid-state drives (up to 64 GB), a technology called Smart Response Technology.

* 1 For Sandy Bridge mainstream desktop and business platforms. Sandy Bridge CPUs provide 16 PCIe 2.0 lanes for direct GPU connectivity.
* 2 For Ivy Bridge mainstream desktop platform. Ivy Bridge CPUs provide 16 PCIe 3.0 lanes for direct GPU connectivity and additional 4 PCIe 2.0 lanes.

=== LGA 1150 ===

Chipsets that support LGA 1150 CPUs are listed below. Haswell and Haswell Refresh CPUs are supported by all listed chipsets; however, a BIOS update is usually required for 8-Series &quot;Lynx Point&quot; motherboards to support Haswell Refresh CPUs. Broadwell CPUs are supported only by 9-Series chipsets, which are usually referred to as &quot;Wildcat Point&quot;.

The C1 stepping of the &quot;Lynx Point&quot; chipset contains a buga system could lose connectivity with USB devices plugged into USB 3.0 ports provided by the chipset if the system enters the S3 sleep mode.

===LGA 1366, LGA 2011, and LGA 2011-v3===

Single socket chipsets supporting LGA 1366, LGA 2011, and LGA 2011-v3 CPUs. Please consult List of Intel Xeon chipsets for further, multi-socket, chipsets for these sockets.

* 1 X58 South Bridge is ICH10/ICH10R.
* 2 X58 TDP includes the X58 IOH TDP in addition to the ICH10/ICH10R TDP.
* 3 For Sandy Bridge enthusiast desktop platform. Sandy Bridge CPUs will provide up to 40 PCIe 3.0 lanes for direct GPU connectivity and additional 4 PCIe 2.0 lanes. NOTE : This reference number 4 is on X79, which is a Sandy bridge -E, not Sandy Bridge, and PCIe 3.0 only is enabled when an Ivy Bridge-E CPU or Xeon E-5 series is used.
* 4 For Haswell enthusiast desktop platform. Haswell CPUs will provide up to 40 PCIe 3.0 lanes for direct GPU connectivity and additional 4 PCIe 2.0 lanes.

===LGA 2066===

Chipsets supporting LGA 2066 socket for Skylake-X processors and Kaby Lake-X processors.

The C621 Chipset also supports LGA 3647 socket for Skylake-SP as well as Cascade Lake-W and Cascade Lake-SP processors.

===Dedicated mobile chipsets===
All Core-i series mobile chipsets have an integrated south bridge.

=== On-package mobile chipsets ===
Every 4th Generation Intel Core and 5th Generation Intel Core processor based on Mobile U-Processor and Y-Processor Lines has an on-package Platform Controller Hub.

== 100/200/300 Series chipsets ==
* All support Intel VT-d and do not support PCI.

===LGA 1151 rev 1===

The 100 Series chipsets (codenamed &quot;Sunrise Point&quot;), for Skylake processors using the LGA 1151 socket, were released in the third quarter of 2015.

The 200 Series chipsets (codenamed &quot;Union Point&quot;) were introduced along with Kaby Lake processors, which also use the LGA 1151 socket; these were released in the first quarter of 2017.

===LGA 1151 rev 2===
While Coffee Lake shares the same socket as Skylake and Kaby Lake, this revision of LGA 1151 is electrically &quot;incompatible&quot; with 100 and 200 series CPUs.

The 300 Series chipsets were introduced along with Coffee Lake processors, which use the LGA 1151 socket; the enthusiast model was released in the last quarter of 2017, the rest of the line was released in 2018.

===Xeon chipsets===
C232 and C242 chipsets do not support CPU integrated GPUs, as they lack FDI support. Officially they support only Xeon processors, but some motherboards also support consumer processors (6/7th generation Core for C230 series, 8/9th generation Core for C240 series and its Pentium/Celeron derivatives).

=== Dedicated mobile chipsets ===

=== On-package mobile chipsets ===

==400/500 Series chipsets==
===LGA 1200===

LGA 1200 is a CPU socket designed for Comet Lake and Rocket Lake desktop CPUs. Like its predecessors, LGA 1200 has the same number of pins its name would suggest: 1200. Under the hood, LGA 1200 is a modified version of LGA 1151, its predecessor. It features 49 additional protruding pins that are used to improve power delivery and provide support for eventual updates with I/O features.
* † Connection to the CPU will be reduced to DMI 3.0 ×4 if a Comet Lake CPU is installed. DMI 3.0 ×8 is only available with Rocket Lake CPUs.
* ‡ Mainboards advertised as H410 and B460 with Rocket Lake support use other 400-series chipsets. (such as H470)

<text>Because ballet became formalized in France, a significant part of ballet terminology is in the French language.
==A==

===À la seconde===
() (Literally &quot;to second&quot;) If a step is done &quot;à la seconde&quot;, it is done to the side. &#x27;Second position&#x27;. It can also be a balance extending one foot off the ground in ‘Second Position’.

===À la quatrième===
() One of the directions of body, facing the audience (&quot;en face&quot;), arms in second position, with one leg extended either to fourth position in front (&quot;quatrième devant&quot;) or fourth position behind (&quot;quatrième derrière&quot;).

===À terre===
() Touching the floor; on the floor.

===Adagio===
Italian, or French &quot;adage&quot;, meaning &#x27;slowly, at ease.&#x27;
# Slow movements performed with fluidity and grace. 
# One of the typical exercises of a traditional ballet class, done both at barre and in center, featuring slow, controlled movements. 
# The section of a &quot;grand pas&quot; (e.g., &quot;grand pas de deux&quot;), often referred to as &quot;grand adage&quot;, that features dance partnering.

===Allegro===
(; meaning &#x27;happy&#x27;) 
# Brisk, lively motion. An attribute of many movements, including those in which a dancer is airborne (e.g., &quot;assemblé&quot;, &quot;changement&quot;, &quot;entrechat&quot;, &quot;sauté&quot;, &quot;sissonne&quot;, &quot;soubresaut&quot;).
# Used in ballet to refer to all jumps, regardless of tempo.
# A category of exercises found in a traditional ballet class, e.g. petit allegro (small, generally fast jumps) and grand allegro (large, generally slower jumps).

===Allongé===
(; meaning &#x27;elongated.&#x27;) Refers to a foot and leg position when the toes and knees are extended and elongated, rather than forming the usual soft curve. Can also refer to a similar arm position.

===Aplomb===
The apparent elegance and precision exhibited by a confident, accomplished dancer.

===Arabesque===
In dance (particularly ballet), arabesque (French: [aʁabɛsk]; literally, &quot;in Arabic fashion&quot;) is a body position in which a dancer stands on one leg (the supporting leg) with the other leg (the working leg) extended, straight, behind the body. The arm positions can vary and are generally allongé. The foot of the supporting leg may be flat on the floor, on the ball of the foot (demi-pointe/relevé), or on the tips of the toes (en pointe).

===Arrondi===
(; meaning &#x27;rounded&#x27;) A position of the hand. Rounded, in contrast with &quot;allongé&quot; (&#x27;stretched out&#x27;, as in arabesque).

===Assemblé===

(; literally &#x27;assembled&#x27;) Sometimes also &quot;pas assemblé&quot;. A jump that takes off from one foot and lands on two feet. When initiated with two feet on the ground (e.g. from fifth position) the working leg performs a &quot;battement glissé&quot;/&quot;dégagé&quot;, brushing out. The dancer launches into a jump, with the second foot then meeting the first foot before landing. A petit assemblé is when a dancer is standing on one foot with the other extended. The dancer then does a small jump to meet the first foot. 

===Attitude===

() A position in which a dancer stands on one leg (the &quot;supporting&quot; leg) while the other leg (&quot;working&quot; leg) is raised and turned out with knee bent to form an angle of approximately 90° between the thigh and the lower leg. The height of the knee versus the foot and the angle of the knee flexion will vary depending on the techniques. The working leg can be held behind (&quot;derrière&quot;), in front (&quot;devant&quot;), or to the side (&quot;à la seconde&quot;) of the body. The alignment of the thigh compared to the midline in Attitude derrière will vary depending on the techniques. The foot of the supporting leg may be flat on the floor, en demi-pointe (ball of the foot), or en pointe (tips of the toes). The standing leg can be straight or bent (&quot;fondu&quot;).

===Avant, en===
(; meaning &#x27;forwards&#x27;) A movement towards the front, as opposed to &quot;en arrière&quot;, which is conversely a movement towards the back. For example, a step travelling &quot;en avant&quot; moves forwards towards the audience, as in &quot;sissonne en avant&quot;.

===Arrière, en===
(; meaning &#x27;backwards&#x27;) A movement towards the back, as opposed to &quot;en avant.&quot;

==B==

===Balancé===

(; &quot;balanced&quot;) A rocking sequence of three steps—&quot;fondu&quot;, &quot;relevé&quot;, &quot;fondu&quot; (down, up, down)—executed in three counts. Before the first count, one foot extends in a &quot;dégagé&quot; to second position (&quot;balancé de côté&quot;) or to the front (&quot;balancé en avant&quot;) or rear (&quot;balancé en arrière&quot;). The second foot in the sequence (in any direction) assembles behind the first to relevé in fifth or fourth position.

===Balançoire===
(; &quot;swing [children&#x27;s toy]&quot;) Swinging the working leg between front (devant) and back (derrière) through first position, usually in conjunction with &quot;grands battements&quot; or &quot;attitudes&quot; and involving seesaw like shifting of the upper body in opposition to the legs. Similar to en cloche.

===Ballerina===
(Italian) A principal female ballet dancer in a ballet company. Ballerinas get more lead roles, which are referred to as principal roles as they are generally danced by principal dancers. Soloists also often dance in principal roles, but most of the time not in the first cast of the show (i.e. the cast that performs the most shows)

===Ballerino===
An informal term for male dancers in a ballet company in Italy.

===Ballet===

French word meaning a ballet performance, a ballet work, a ballet company and possibly the ballet dance genre, although the expression &quot;danse classique&quot; also exists for the latter meaning, is less equivocal and is more commonly used when referring to the learning of this dance.

===Ballet technique===
The foundational principles of body movement and form used in ballet.

===Balletomane===
A ballet fan or enthusiast. The word is of Russian origin c. 1930, with the suffix &quot;-mane&quot; coming from &quot;maniya&quot; (mania).

===Ballon===
Showing lightness of movement in leaps and jumps. A dancer exhibiting &quot;ballon&quot; will appear to spring effortlessly, float in mid-air, and land softly like a balloon.

===Ballonné===
In classical ballet, the term ballonné is a step where the leg is extended (can be front, side, or back) at 45 degrees. The knee is then bent and the foot brought to a sur le cou-de-pied position. This can also be done as a relevé or jump.

===Ballotté===
A ballotté is a jumping step in classical ballet that consists of coupé dessous and small developpés performed with a rocking and swinging movement. The step can be performed with the leg extensions at 45 or 90 degrees.

===Barre===

A sturdy horizontal bar, approximately waist height, used during ballet warm-up exercises and training. Fixed barres are typically mounted on 
-covered walls; portable barres can be relocated as needed. Used for balance, not support. A barre is a tool, not a necessary item to dance.

===Battement===
An alternating side-to-side movement of the working (non-supporting) leg. Typically performed in multiples, quickly and in rapid succession so that the working foot appears to be fluttering or vibrating.

===Batterie===
() A general term for jumps in which the legs open slightly sideways and close (crossed in fifth position) multiple times, alternating feet. (See &quot;Battu.)

===Battu===
(; meaning &#x27;beaten&#x27;) A movement with an extra beating of the feet included, as in &quot;jeté battu&quot;.

===Brisé===
(; literally &#x27;broken&#x27;) A jump consisting of an &quot;assemblé&quot; traveling either forward (en avant) or backward (en arrière), with an extra beat that &quot;breaks&quot; the jump in its travel. To execute a brisé en avant, the dancer demi-pliés in fifth position and brushes the back leg (through first position) to the front, then springs into the air and brings the second foot to meet it in the back before switching to the front to land, creating a beating action with the legs. In a brisé en arrière, the process is reversed, with the front leg brushing to the back and beating to land in front.

===Bras croisé===

(; literally &#x27;crossed arms&#x27;) Arm placement in which one arm is extended in second position away from the audience while the other is curved in first position (Cecchetti fourth position &quot;en avant&quot; or RAD/French third position).

===Bravura===
() A flashy, showy and elaborate style of dance that involves a lot of elaborate steps and style to similar music. Usually during a key solo.

===Bourrée===
Quick movement of the feet, can be performed on pointe or on demi-pointe. The dancer straightens one leg (the leg in back) and bends a leg and picks it up(the leg in front). Then the bent leg is straighted on the floor and the straight leg is picked off the floor and bent. These steps are repeated over and over again. The dancer looks as if he or she is flying across the floor.

==C==

===Cabriole===

(; meaning &#x27;caper.&#x27;) An allegro step in which the extended legs are beaten in the air. Cabrioles are divided into two categories: petite, which are executed at 45 degrees, and grande, which are executed at 90 degrees. The working leg is thrust into the air, the underneath leg follows and beats against the first leg, sending it higher. The landing is then made on the underneath leg. Cabriole may be done devant, derrière and à la seconde in any given position of the body such as croisé, effacé, écarté, and so on.

===Cambré===
(; literally &#x27;arched.&#x27;) A bending at the waist in any direction, forward, backward, or to the side.
===Chaînés===
(; &#x27;chained&#x27;, plural.) Also known as &quot;chaînés turns&quot;, a common abbreviation for &quot;tours chaînés déboulés&quot;, a series of quick, 360 degree turns that alternate the feet while traveling along a straight line or in a circular path. Each foot performs a half turn, with feet held in a tight first position en pointe or demi-pointe.

===Changement de pied===
(; literally &#x27;change, changing.&#x27;) A jump in which the feet change positions in the air. For example, beginning in fifth position with the right foot front, &quot;plié&quot;, jump switching the right leg to the back, and land in fifth position with the left foot front. In the Vaganova vocabulary, &quot;petit changement de pieds&quot; indicates a &quot;changement&quot; where the feet barely leave the floor.

===Chassé===

(Literally &#x27;chased.&#x27;) 
# A sliding movement forward, backward, or sideways with both legs bent, then springing into the air with legs straight and together. It can be done either in a gallop or by pushing the leading foot along the floor in a &quot;plié&quot; to cause an upward spring. It is typically performed in a series or as part of a combination of other movements.
# A sliding movement as described above, but without the jump aspect. Instead, the leading foot is pushed along the floor in plié as described above, as a transition into another movement or position.

===Cloche, en===
(; meaning &#x27;like a bell.&#x27;) Refers to brushing through first position from fourth devant or fourth derrière to the opposite fourth with the upper body held upright. Can be done continuously, as is often done with grands battements and attitudes. Similar to Balançoire, which additionally allows seesaw like upper-body shifting in counterpoint to the legs.

The Vaganova system may refer to &quot;en cloche&quot; as &quot;passé la jambe&quot; or &quot;battement passé la jambe&quot;.

===Coda===
(); literally &#x27;tail&#x27;). The concluding segment of a performance or suite of dances comprising a &quot;grand pas&quot; (e.g., grand pas de deux). A particularly large or complex coda may be called a &quot;grand coda&quot;. If a large group of dancers participate, the terms &quot;coda générale&quot; or &quot;grand coda générale&quot; may be used.

===Corps de ballet===
The ensemble of a ballet company, especially the ensemble apart from the featured dancers. Being a part of the corps means one is neither a soloist nor a principal dancer.

===Coryphée===
() In some systems, a dancer of higher rank than a member of the corps de ballet, performing in small ensembles and small solo roles but not ranked as a soloist.

===Côté, de===
(; &#x27;sideways.&#x27;) A movement traveling to the side.

===Cou-de-pied===
(; &#x27;neck of the foot.&#x27;) Position of the arched working foot raised to, and resting on, the ankle. This could be in front ([&quot;conditional&quot;] &quot;devant&quot;), behind (&quot;derrière&quot;), or wrapped (&quot;sur le cou-de-pied&quot;: arch of the foot wrapped around the ankle with the heel in front of the ankle and the toes behind, often interchangeable with the devant/conditional position), depending on the activity and the school/method of ballet.

===Coupé===
(; meaning &#x27;cut.&#x27;) Coupé is both a step and action. It is commonly executed from &quot;cou-de-pied&quot; front to &quot;cou-de-pied&quot; back or vice versa. It may also be done from an extended leg position into &quot;fondu&quot; or directly through fifth position (as in concluding a &quot;jeté&quot;). Coupé can only be performed through a closed leg position.

The Vaganova School rarely uses the term &quot;coupé&quot; except as the preparation for specific allegros. Rather, &quot;tombé through fifth position&quot; is more commonly used.

In the United States, &quot;coupé&quot; may be used to denote the position &quot;cou-de-pied,&quot; not unlike &quot;passé&quot; is used to denote the position &quot;retiré&quot; in addition to the action of passing through retiré.

===Couru===
(; &#x27;run,&#x27; past participle, as in &#x27;making small quick steps.&#x27;) In most cases, this holds the calves together and the feet in a tight fifth position en pointe or demi-pointe and travels forward, backward, or to either side. E.g. &quot;pas de bourrée couru&quot; (also called bourrée for short).
(; meaning &#x27;crossed.&#x27;) One of the positions of the body or &quot;épaulement&quot;. Facing one of the corners of the stage, the body presents at an oblique angle to the audience, such that the audience can see still both shoulders and hips. The working leg may be crossed to the front (devant) or to the back (derrière).

&quot;Croisé&quot; is used in the third, fourth, and fifth positions of the legs. A dancer is in &quot;croisé devant&quot; if at a 45 angle to the audience, the downstage leg (closest to the audience) is working to the front and the arms are open in third or fourth with the downstage arm being the one in second. A dancer is in &quot;croisé derrière&quot; if at a 45 degree angle to the audience, the upstage leg (farthest from the audience) is working to the back and the arms are open in third, fourth, or allongé in arabesque with the upstage arm being the one out towards second, e.g. &quot;arabesque croisée&quot; or Russian fourth arabesque. &quot;Croisé derrière&quot; in the Russian school alternatively has the upstage leg working to the back, but the downstage arm out to second.

Examples of &quot;croisé&quot;: the front leg is the right leg and the dancer is facing the front-left corner of the stage; or the front leg is the left, and the dancer is facing his/her front-right corner.

===Croix, en===
(; meaning &#x27;in the shape of a cross.&#x27;) Term often used during barre exercises to indicate that a step is done to the front, to the side, to the back, and then again to the side (as in the shape of a cross), finishing closed in either first or fifth position.

===Dedans, en===
(; &#x27;inwards.&#x27;) Inside movement.
# Circular movement where a leg that starts at the back or the side moves towards the front. For the right leg, this is a counter-clockwise circle. For the left leg, this is a clockwise circle. For example, in a &quot;rond de jambe en dedans&quot;, starting from first position, the foot first extends to &quot;tendu&quot; back, then moves to &quot;tendu&quot; to the side, and then &quot;tendu&quot; front, and back in again to first position.
# Turning motion in the direction of the supporting leg. In a &quot;pirouette en dedans&quot;, the dancer would turn to their right if their left leg was lifted, or vice versa. Opposite of &quot;en dehors&quot;.

===Dégagé===
(; &#x27;disengaged.&#x27;) Common abbreviation for &quot;battement dégagé,&quot; the foot of the working leg sharply brushes through the floor through tendu pointed in the air 45 degrees or lower. Dégagé is part of the (initiating) execution of jumps such as jeté, assemblé, brisé, and glissade.

Primarily a Cecchetti/RAD term, this is known as &quot;battement tendu jeté&quot; in the Russian School or &quot;battement glissé&quot; in the French School.

===Dehors, en===
(; &#x27;outwards.&#x27;) Circular movement where a leg that starts at the front or the side moves towards the back. For a right working leg, this is a clockwise circle. For example, in a &quot;rond de jambe en dehors&quot;, starting from first position, the foot (either left or right) would first extend &quot;tendu&quot; front, move to &quot;tendu&quot; to the side, and then &quot;tendu&quot; back, and back in again to first position. In a &quot;pirouette en dehors&quot;, the body turns in the direction of the working leg (the leg raised in &quot;retiré passé&quot;). Opposite of &quot;en dedans&quot;.

===Demi===
(; meaning &#x27;half.&#x27;) Applied to &quot;plié&quot;, &quot;pointe&quot;, and other movements or positions to indicate a smaller or lesser version.

===Demi-détourné===
() A pivoted half turn executed on both feet. For example, if starting right foot front in fifth position, demi-plié and relevé onto demi-pointe while pivoting a half turn inwards/&quot;en dedans&quot; towards the direction of the back foot (here left). The feet will have now changed position with the left foot in front in fifth position.

===Demi-pointe===
() Supporting one&#x27;s body weight on the balls of one or both feet, heels raised off the floor.

===Derrière===
(; literally &#x27;behind.&#x27;) At or to the back. For example, a &quot;battement tendu derrière&quot; is a &quot;battement tendu&quot; to the rear.

===Dessous===
(; literally &#x27;under.&#x27;) Used to indicate that the front leg should be brought to close behind the other leg during a step. For example, &quot;assemblé&quot;, &quot;pas de bourrée&quot;, and &quot;glissade&quot; can be designated as &quot;under&quot; or &quot;dessous&quot;.

===Dessus===
(; literally &#x27;over.&#x27;) Used to indicate that the back leg should be brought to close in front of the other leg during a step. For example, &quot;assemblé&quot;, &quot;pas de bourrée&quot;, and &quot;glissade&quot; can be designated as &quot;over&quot; or &quot;dessus&quot;.

===Devant===
(; literally &#x27;front.&#x27;) Facing or moving to the front, as in &quot;tendu devant&quot; or &quot;attitude devant&quot;.

===Développé===

() Common abbreviation for &quot;temps développé&quot;. A movement in which the leg is lifted to cou-de-pied or retiré and then fully extended outward, passing through &quot;attitude&quot;. It can be done to the front (&quot;devant&quot;), to the side (&quot;à la seconde&quot;), or to the back (&quot;derrière&quot;).

===Double===
(; &#x27;double.&#x27;) Making two of a movement, such as in &quot;double rond de jambe en l&#x27;air&quot;.

==E==

===Écarté===
(; literally &#x27;spread,&#x27; as in &#x27;separated.&#x27;) One of the basic positions of the body facing the audience at an oblique angle and with the downstage leg open to the side of the body, along the other diagonal, either touching the floor or &quot;en l&#x27;air&quot;. The arm on the same side as the working leg (i.e. the downstage arm) is raised &quot;en haut&quot; and the other arm is in second position. The gaze is directed to the raised arm along the same diagonal

In schools that recognize an &quot;écarté derrière&quot;, such as the French school, &quot;écarté devant&quot; is described above, and &quot;écarté derrière&quot; differs in having the working leg in second being on the same side as the corner the body is facing, i.e. the upstage leg is the working leg; the upstage arm is &quot;en haut,&quot; and the gaze is directed down the length of the arm in second.

===Échappé===
(; literally &#x27;escaped.&#x27;) A movement done from a closed (first or fifth) position to an open (second or fourth) position. There are two kinds of &quot;échappés&quot;: &quot;échappé sauté&quot; and &quot;échappé sur les pointes&quot; or &quot;demi-pointes&quot;. In an &quot;échappé sauté&quot;, a dancer takes a deep &quot;plié&quot; followed by a jump in which the legs &quot;escape&quot; into either second (usually when initiating from first position) or fourth position (usually when initiating from fifth position) landing in &quot;demi-plié&quot;. In &quot;échappé sur le pointes/demi-pointes&quot; a dancer begins with a deep &quot;plié&quot;, springs onto &quot;les pointes&quot; or &quot;demi-pointes&quot;, ending in either second position (when starting from first position) or fourth (when starting from fifth) with knees straight. The dancer may or may not return to the initial position, depending on the choreography.

===Élevé===
(; &#x27;raised, lifted.&#x27;) Rising to &quot;pointe&quot; or &quot;demi-pointe&quot; from straight legs and flat feet. This term is used in some schools in contrast with relevé (in effect, &#x27;relifted&#x27;), which is taken to indicate a rise from plié (bent knees). In other schools (French, Russian, textbook Cecchetti), &quot;relevé&quot; covers both these concepts.

===Emboîté===
# A small traveling step (en avant or en arrière) where each leg is alternately brought to cou-de-pied, passing the previous standing leg in doing so. Both legs shoot straight downward in the air, and land on one foot in cou-de-pied. This step is often done turning (&quot;en tournant&quot;), where each jump rotates 1/2 turn.
# A traveling series of jumps where each leg is alternately brought to attitude devant in the air, each foot passing the previous one in alternating.
# A series of small walks done on pointe or demi-pointe, traveling either forward (&quot;en avant&quot;) or backward (&quot;en arrière&quot;); the dancer stands in sous-sus and brushes one leg to the side, then closes it in the opposite position (front or back) of where it started, and repeats this motion several times in succession, alternating legs.
# A variation on the typical tour piqué/piqué turn, where the dancer does 1/2 piqué turn as usual, then, without coming off relevé, steps onto the previously working leg and lifts the previously supporting leg to retiré to finish the turn. This can be done several times in succession. (See &quot;Piqué turn.&quot;)

===En===
(; meaning &#x27;in.&#x27;) A preposition used in description of a dancer&#x27;s position (e.g., &quot;en plié&quot;, &quot;en relevé&quot;, &quot;en pointe&quot;) or holding the meaning &#x27;towards&#x27; when describing direction of a movement (&quot;en avant&quot;, &quot;en arrière&quot;, &quot;en dedans&quot;, &quot;en dehors&quot; = &#x27;to the front,&#x27; &#x27;to the back&#x27;, &#x27;to the inside,&#x27; &#x27;to the outside&#x27;).

===Entrechat===
(; from Italian &quot;intrecciata&quot;, &#x27;intertwined.&#x27;) &quot;A step of beating in which the dancer jumps into the air and rapidly crosses the legs before and behind.&quot; In an &quot;entrechat quatre&quot; (&#x27;four&#x27;), starting from fifth position, right foot front, a dancer will jump up with legs crossed, execute a changement beating the right thigh at the back of the left thigh, then bring the right leg in front again beating the front of the left thigh, and land in the same position as started. In an &quot;entrechat six&quot; (&#x27;six&#x27;), three changes of the feet are made in the air, ultimately changing which foot is in front. Even-numbered entrechats indicate the number of times the legs cross in and out in the air: a regular changement is two (one out, one in), entrechat quatre is two outs, two ins; six is three and three; huit is four and four. Odd-numbered entrechats refer to the previous number, but done landing on one foot with the other in cou-de-pied: for example, an &quot;entrechat cinq&quot; (five) is the same as an entrechat-quatre, but done landing on one leg.

===Entrée===
# The initial part of a &quot;grand pas&quot;, which serves as an introduction for the suite of dances comprising the grand pas.
# The initial appearance of a lead character or characters of a ballet on stage.

===Épaulé===
(; &#x27;shouldered.&#x27;) One of the positions of the body or &quot;épaulement&quot; where the body is at an oblique angle to the audience, the downstage arm is &quot;allongé&quot; in front and the downstage shoulder appears prominent to the audience as the downstage leg works to the back (e.g. second arabesque).

===Épaulement===
(; &#x27;shouldering.&#x27;) Rotation of the shoulders and head relative to the hips in a pose or a step. This term relates only to the movement of the body from the waist up. The head generally looks over shoulder that is forward (downstage).

===Étoile===
The leading ballet dancer in a company.

==F==

===Face, en===
(; &#x27;facing, in front of.&#x27;) &quot;En face&quot; indicates facing something directly, generally the audience.

===Failli===
( &#x27;given way&#x27;, past participle.) A slide or brush-through transition step following a preceding jump or position. &quot;Failli&quot; is often used as shorthand for a &quot;sissonne (ouverte +pas) failli,&quot; indicating a jump from two feet landing on one (&quot;sissonne&quot;) with the back foot then sliding through to the front (&quot;chassé passé&quot;), and this is often done in conjunction with an assemblé: &quot;(sissonne) failli assemblé&quot;. E.g. From croisé, the upstage leg opens behind on the sissonne as the body changes direction in the air to land ouverte effacé; the back leg which is now downstage slides through in a chassé passé to fourth in front, ending the dancer croisé the corner opposite the original. This chassé passé is the (pas) failli. An assemblé (dessus/over) to the opposite corner would reorient the body back to its original position. &quot;Failli&quot; phrased with &quot;arabesque&quot; indicates the brushed follow-through of an arabesqued leg from elevated behind to fourth in front as lead-in to a following step.

===First position (feet)===
Turned out legs with the feet pointing in opposite directions, heels touching.

===Fermé, fermée===
(; &#x27;closed.&#x27;) Converse of ouvert(e) (&#x27;open&#x27;). Fermé may refer to positions (the first, fifth, and third positions of the feet are positions fermées), limbs, directions, or certain exercises or steps. Example: a &quot;sissonne fermée&quot; ends with closed legs, as opposed to a &quot;sissonne ouverte,&quot; which lands on one leg with the other (generally) extended.

===Fish dive===

A partnering dance lift, often performed as part of a pas de deux, in which the male dancer supports the female in a poisson position.

===Flic flac===
() Familiar French term for battement fouetté à terre. A step where the foot of the working leg sweeps flexed across the floor from pointed à la seconde (en l&#x27;air, as in dégagé) to pointed at cou-de-pied devant or derrière.
===Fondu===

(; literally &#x27;melted.&#x27;)

# Abbreviation for &quot;battement fondu&quot;, a lowering of the body made by bending the knee of the supporting leg, the working leg extending out à terre or in the air. Saint-Léon wrote, &quot;Fondu is on one leg what a plié is on two.&quot; &quot;Fondu&quot; at the barre often refers to battement fondu développé, where the supporting leg begins fondu with the foot of the working leg at cou-de-pied; the working leg extends out through a petit développé as the supporting leg straightens.
# A term used to modify any one-legged position in order to indicate a bent supporting leg (e.g. arabesque fondu).

===Fouetté===

(; literally &#x27;whipped.&#x27;) &quot;Fouetté&quot; itself refers to a move where a quick pivot on the supporting leg changes the orientation of the body and the working leg. E.g. A 180-degree or 90-degree fouetté could involve a working leg beginning extended elevated in front; the supporting leg rising onto demi-pointe or pointe quickly executing a &quot;half&quot; turn inside/en dedans, leading to the working leg ending in arabesque and the body now facing the opposite direction or stage direction. (This brand of action can be seen in both tour jetés and waltz turns (&quot;pas de valse en tournant&quot;).) A fouetté could also change the leg/body orientation from, for example, en face à la seconde to épaulé (second) arabesque/croisé first arabesque or effacé devant, if outside/en dehors, via a 45-degree turn.

&quot;Fouetté&quot; is also common shorthand for fouetté rond de jambe en tournant (pictured here &quot;en dehors&quot;). A fouetté turn is a turn that begins with the supporting leg in plié. As the supporting foot transitions to &quot;demi-pointe&quot; or &quot;pointe&quot;, in an en dehors turn, the working leg extends forward and then whips around to the side as the working foot is retracted to the supporting knee in retiré, creating the impetus to rotate one turn. The working leg returns out of retiré nearing the end of a single rotation to restart the entire leg motion for successive rotations.

===Fouetté jeté===
() A leap that begins with a &quot;fouetté&quot;.

===Frappé===

(; &#x27;struck.&#x27;) Abbreviation of &quot;battement frappé.&quot; Action of extending the working foot out from cou-de-pied. In Cecchetti, RAD, and American ballet, on flat, this action involves brushing a flexed (or non-pointed relaxed) foot from cou-de-pied through the floor, the ball of the foot (lightly) striking as extending out pointed through dégagé. In the Russian school, a pointed foot at cou-de-pied extends directly out to dégagé height without brushing through the floor. On demi-pointe, Cecchetti employs the Russian style of non-brushed pointed foot directly out. Other schools may use a flexed foot without the strike or a non-brushed pointed foot on demi-pointe.

Frappés are commonly done in singles, doubles, or triples. Double and triple frappés involve tapping the foot (flexed or pointed) at both cou-de-pied devant (or wrapped) and derrière before extending out. (E.g. Double frappé front would be cou-de-pied back, cou-de-pied front, dégagé front. Double frappé back would be front, back, [dégagé] back. Triple frappé front would be front, back, front, [dégagé] front.)

===Fifth position===

A posture in which the feet are turned outward. With one foot in the front and one in the back, you will make fifth position. The front foot is usually facing horizontal while the back foot is diagonal. It does not matter which foot is in the front or back, as long as they are turned out. You can do pirouettes, changements, frappés, plies, and much more with fifth position.

==G==

===Gargouillade===
A complicated jump involving a pas de chat with a double rond de jambe.

===Glissade===

(; literally &#x27;glide.&#x27;) A traveling step starting in fifth position from &quot;demi-plié&quot;. The leading foot brushes out to dégagé as weight bears on the trailing leg, weight is shifted to the leading leg via a jump and the trailing foot extends out of plié into degagé. The leading foot lands tombé and the trailing foot slides in to meet the leading foot in fifth position demi-plié. A &quot;glissade&quot; can be done &quot;en avant&quot;, &quot;en arrière&quot;, &quot;dessous&quot; (leading front foot ends back), &quot;dessus&quot; (leading back foot ends front), or without a changement of feet.

===Glissade précipitée===

(; &quot;precipitated glide&quot;.) A quick &quot;glissade&quot; generally done leading into a following step, such as with &quot;glissade jeté&quot; or &quot;glissade assemblé&quot;.

===Grand écart===
(; literally &quot;big gap&quot;.) Opening the legs to 180°, front or sideways. Known as &#x27;spagat&#x27; in German or &#x27;the splits&#x27; or &#x27;jump splits&#x27; in English.

===Grand plié===
() A full &quot;plié&quot; or bending of the knees. Throughout the movement, the pelvis should be kept neutral, the back straight and aligned with the heels, the legs turned out, and the knees over the feet. From standing to bent this should be fluid. A purpose of the grand plié is to warm up the ankles and stretch the calves. In a grande plié the heels come off the ground in first, fourth, and fifth position.

===Grand jeté===

() A long horizontal jump, starting from one leg and landing on the other. Known as a split in the air. It is most often done forward and usually involves doing full leg splits in mid-air. It consists basically of a &quot;grand écart&quot; with a moving jump. The front leg brushes straight into the air in a &quot;grand battement&quot;, as opposed to from &quot;développé&quot; (or an unfolding motion). The back leg follows making the splits in the air. It can be performed &quot;en avant&quot; (forward), &quot;à la seconde&quot; (to the side), &quot;en arrière&quot; (backward), and &quot;en tournant&quot; (turning en dedans). The dancer must remember to hit the fullest split at the height of the jump, with weight pushed slightly forward, giving the dancer a gliding appearance.

===Grand pas===
A suite of individual dances that serves as a showpiece for lead dancers, demi-soloists, and in some cases the &quot;corps de ballet&quot;. Often regarded as the pièce de résistance of a ballet. It usually consists of an &quot;entrée&quot;, a &quot;grand adage&quot;, and a &quot;coda&quot;, which brings the suite to a conclusion. After the adage, it may include a dance for the &quot;corps de ballet&quot; (often referred to as the &quot;ballabile&quot;), variations for demi-soloists, variations for lead ballerina and danseur, or some combinations of these.

Various types of &quot;grand pas&quot; are found in ballet, including:
* A &quot;grand pas d&#x27;action&quot; is one that contributes to a ballet&#x27;s story. 
* In a &quot;grand pas classique&quot;, classical ballet technique prevails and no character dances are included.
* A &quot;grand pas de deux&quot; serves as the &quot;pièce de résistance&quot; for the principal male and female characters of a full-length ballet.
* A grand pas danced by three or four dancers is a &quot;grand pas de trois&quot; or &quot;grand pas de quatre&quot;, respectively.

==H==

===Hortensia===

&quot;A male dancer&#x27;s step in which the dancer jumps into the air with the legs drawn up, one in front of the other, then reverses their position [...] several times before landing with the feet apart again.&quot; This step can look akin to swimming in air.

==J==

===Jeté===
(; &#x27;thrown.&#x27;) A leap in which one leg appears to be thrown in the direction of the movement (en avant, en arrière, or sideways). There are several kinds of &quot;jetés&quot;, including &quot;jeté / jeté ordinaire&quot; (RAD) / &quot;pas jeté&quot; (Rus.), &quot;grand jeté&quot;, and &quot;tour jeté&quot; (ABT) / &quot;grand jeté en tournant&quot; (Fr./Cecc.) / &quot;jeté entrelacé&quot; (Rus.), or the common compound step &quot;coupé jeté (en tournant)&quot;.

* Jeté (&quot;jeté ordinaire/pas jeté&quot;) refers to a jump initiated en plié, with the pointed working foot brushing out in dégagé from cou-de-pied (derrière) to seconde (action similar to a non-Russian-style flat frappé), weight being transferred via a jump propelled by pushing off the standing leg from plié, the leading leg landing tombé and the foot of the other/former standing leg ending cou-de-pied (derrière). Some schools (including ABT at one point) may still refer to this as a &quot;petit jeté&quot;.
* Grand jeté: see &quot;grand jeté&quot;, a jump initiated with a grand battement en avant of the leading leg while pushing off the trailing leg from plié (usually led into by some moving step such as chassé, glissade en avant, or pas couru), the trailing leg brushing to grand battement derrière while in the air, the jump ultimately landing on the leading leg. Resembles the splits (en l&#x27;air).
* Tour jeté / jeté en tournant (&#x27;turn&#x27;/&#x27;interlaced&#x27;) is a grand jeté done turning: a jump initiated with a grand battement en avant of the leading leg, followed by a fouetté turning the direction of the body 180 degrees and the trailing leg brushing through to a grand battement derrière, the jump landing arabesque with the leading leg now the standing (landing) leg.
* Coupé jeté en tournant is a compound step, usually done in multiples &quot;en manège&quot; (&#x27;in a circle&#x27;), of a coupé (changing the supporting foot) initiating the first quarter of a turn leading into a grand jeté completing the 360-degree rotation of the turn.
* Petit jeté in RAD and the French school refers to a one-footed changement passing through cou-de-pied and is what other schools refer to as a changement emboîté.

==M==

===Manèges===
Manèges is a classical ballet term meaning “circular.” It describes when a dancer does steps in a circular pattern around the stage.

Usually, manèges will be a repetition of one or two steps, but can also be a combination of several. For example, a coupé jeté manèges is typically done by a male dancer in a coda of a classical pas de deux. Ballerinas will often do piqué manèges in a variation or also in a coda.

==O==

===Ouvert, ouverte===
(; &#x27;open, opened.&#x27;) Converse of &quot;fermé(e)&quot; (&#x27;closed&#x27;). &quot;Ouvert&quot; may refer to positions (the second and fourth positions of the feet are positions ouvertes), limbs, directions, or certain exercises or steps. In the French School, this term is used to indicate a position or direction of the body similar to

==P==

===Partnering===
Dancing performed by a pair of dancers, typically a male and a female, in which the pair strives to achieve a harmony of coordinated movements so that the audience remains unaware of the mechanics. A dance that is focused on a single pair of partnering dancers is a pas de deux. For a male dancer, partnering may involve lifting, catching, and carrying a partner, and providing assistance and support for leaps, promenades and pirouettes.

===Pas===
(; literally &#x27;step.&#x27;) A dance, or a suite of dances as in &quot;grand pas&quot;.

===Pas de basque===
(; &#x27;step of the Basques.&#x27;) Halfway between a step and a leap, taken on the floor (&quot;glissé&quot;) or with a jump (&quot;sauté&quot;); it can be done moving toward the front or toward the back. This step can also be found in Scottish highland dance.

Starting in fifth position &quot;croisé&quot;, a dancer executes a &quot;plié&quot; while brushing the downstage leg out to &quot;tendu&quot; front. The downstage leg does a &quot;demi rond de jambe&quot; to the opposite corner while the body turns to face that corner. Weight is quickly transferred to that brushed leg, now upstage, allowing the dancer to pass the newly downstage leg through first position via a &quot;chassé passé&quot; to fourth devant, ending &quot;croisé&quot; the new corner, and finishing by bringing the upstage leg in to close fifth.

===Pas de bourrée===

(; &#x27;step of bourrée.&#x27;) A quick sequence of movements beginning with extension of the first leg while demi-plié, closing the first leg to the second as both transition to relevé (demi-pointe or pointe), extending the second leg to an open position while relevé, and closing the first leg to the second in demi-plié (or optionally with legs straight if performed quickly or as the final step of an enchainement). Variants include: 
* pas de bourrée derrière – &#x27;behind&#x27; / pas de bourrée devant – &#x27;front&#x27; 
* pas de bourrée dessus – &#x27;over,&#x27; initially closing the working foot in front / pas de bourrée dessous – &#x27;under,&#x27; initially closing the working foot behind
* pas de bourrée en arriere – &#x27;traveling backward&#x27; / pas be bourrée en avant – &#x27;traveling forward&#x27;
* pas be bourrée en tournant en dedans – &#x27;turning inward&#x27; / pas de bourrée en tournant en dehors – &#x27;turning outward&#x27;
* pas de bourrée ouvert – &#x27;open,&#x27; an &quot;open-&gt;closed-&gt;open&quot; sequence 
* pas de bourrée piqué – &#x27;pricked,&#x27; with working leg quickly lifted after pricking the floor
* pas de bourrée couru – &#x27;running,&#x27; also &#x27;flowing like a river&#x27;

===Pas de chat===

(; &#x27;step of the cat.&#x27;) A traveling sideways jump where while mid-air the legs are successively bent, brought to retiré, feet as high up as possible, knees apart. The Dance of the Cygnets from &quot;Swan Lake&quot; involves sixteen &quot;pas de chat&quot; performed by four dancers holding hands, arms interlaced.

In the Cecchetti and French schools, this may be referred to as a &quot;saut de chat&quot; (&#x27;jump of the cat&#x27;).

====Grand pas de chat====
A jump where the leading leg extends forward through &quot;grand battement&quot; (a &quot;French &quot;pas de chat&quot;&quot;) or &quot;développé&quot; (an &quot;Italian &quot;pas de chat&quot;&quot;) and the trailing leg remains in &quot;retiré&quot; until landing.

====&quot;Russian&quot; pas de chat====
A jump where the legs are successively brought to attitude derrière instead of retiré. This variant of the pas de chat appears in several Petipa ballets (e.g. the fourth variation in Paquita).

===Pas de cheval===
(; &#x27;step of the horse.&#x27;) A movement of the leg (when extended) through first or fifth position, to &quot;cou-de-pied&quot; and then energetically out to a &quot;pointe tendue&quot; through a petit développé.

===Pas de deux===
(&#x27;Step of two.&#x27;) A dance duet, usually performed by a female and a male dancer.

===Pas de poisson===
(; &#x27;step of the fish.&#x27;) A type of &quot;soubresaut&quot;, or a jump without a change of feet. From fifth position, a dancer executes a deep &quot;demi-plié&quot; and then jumps arching the back with straight legs behind, so that the body is curved like a fish jumping out of water. Also called &quot;temps de poisson&quot;.

===Pas de quatre===
(&#x27;Step of four.&#x27;) A dance by four dancers.

===Pas de trois===
(&#x27;Step of three.&#x27;) A dance by three dancers.

===Pas de valse===
(; &#x27;waltz step.&#x27;) A sequence of three steps—&quot;fondu, relevé, elevé&quot; (down, up, up)—always advancing (like a march), done in three counts to music generally in time, traveling in any direction or while turning (&quot;en tournant&quot;). The feet do not assemble (or &quot;cross each other&quot;) on any step as occurs in a balancé; each step instead passes the last.

===Passé===

(; literally &#x27;passed.&#x27;) Passing the working foot through from back to front or vice versa. Generally used to refer to &quot;retiré passé&quot;, indicating passing the foot of the working leg past the knee of the supporting leg (on, below, or above) from back to front or front to back. &quot;Retiré passé&quot; may initiate or complete by sliding the working foot up or down the supporting leg from or to the floor, may be executed directly from an open position such as in &quot;pirouette&quot; from fourth, or may transition from knee to another position such as &quot;arabesque&quot; or &quot;attitude&quot; (as in &quot;développé&quot;). A chassé can also pass through from back to front as in (&quot;sissonne&quot;) failli: &quot;chassé passé.&quot;
===Penché===

(; &#x27;tilted&#x27;.) Tilting the body forward about the hip of the supporting leg so that the head is lower than the working leg, as in &quot;arabesque penché&quot;. Doing a split while standing on one foot. The dancer lifts the leg more than 90 degrees.

===Petit saut===
(; &#x27;small jump.&#x27;) A small jump, in which the feet do not change positions in mid-air; also called &quot;temps levé sauté&quot; in the Vaganova vocabulary.

===Piqué===
(; meaning &#x27;pricked.&#x27;) A movement in which the raised, pointed foot of the working leg is lowered so that it pricks the floor and then either rebounds upward (as in &quot;battement piqué&quot;) or becomes a supporting foot. In the latter case, it may be used to transfer a stance from one leg to the other by stepping out directly onto an &quot;en pointe&quot; or &quot;demi-pointe&quot; foot and often immediately precedes a movement that entails elevating the new working leg, such as a &quot;piqué arabesque&quot;.

In Cecchetti and RAD, the term posé is used instead of &quot;piqué&quot; outside of the battement: &quot;piqué arabesque&quot; and ABT &quot;piqué turn/tour piqué&quot; (&quot;en dedans&quot;) / Rus. &quot;tour dégagé&quot; = RAD/Cecc. &quot;posé arabesque&quot; and &quot;posé turn/posé en tournant&quot;.

===Piqué turn===
A &quot;tour piqué&quot; or piqué turn is a traveling turn executed by the leg stepping out onto an en pointe or demi-pointe foot becoming the supporting leg while the working leg moves from plié to retiré derrière, if an en dedans turn, or retiré devant, if an en dehors turn. In fast piqué turns, petit retiré may be executed instead (i.e. working foot at cou-de-pied). Most commonly done en dedans, piqué turns en dehors are also referred to as &quot;lame ducks&quot;.

===Pirouette===

() A non-traveling turn on one leg, of one or more rotations, often starting with one or both legs in &quot;plié&quot; and rising onto &quot;demi-pointe&quot; or &quot;pointe&quot;. The non-supporting leg is generally held in &quot;retiré devant&quot; (&#x27;front&#x27;)—when initiated from fourth, this would be a retiré passé—but could also be held in other positions such as &quot;seconde&quot;. Pirouettes are most often executed &quot;en dehors&quot;, turning outwards in the direction of the working leg, but can also be done &quot;en dedans&quot;, turning inwards in the direction of the supporting leg. (e.g. &quot;En dehors&quot; turns clockwise (to the right) if the right leg is working and the left leg supporting/standing.) Spotting is employed to help maintain balance. A pirouette may return to its starting position or finish in &quot;arabesque&quot; or &quot;attitude&quot;.

In other genres of dance, such as jazz or modern, it is common to see pirouettes performed with legs &quot;parallel&quot; (i.e. sixth position) instead of turned out as in ballet.

===Plié===
(; literally &#x27;bent.&#x27;) A smooth and continuous bending of the knees outward with the upper body held upright.
In demi-plié, (in a first, second, fourth, and fifth position) a dancer bends the knees while maintaining turnout. While in a demi-plié position one must remember to have proper alignment. Head over shoulders, shoulders over hips over knees and knees over feet. When initiating a demi-plié one must pull up and resist against going down. Lengthening from the center and back of the head and pressing down through the floor through the balls of the feet. As you are bending your knees you have to maintain the proper alignment and make sure that the knees are going over the big toe. Creating proper turn out by rotating the inner thighs forward and you go down. Making sure to keep the pelvis in line as you go down and up so that you do not release your seat and stick your chest forward. at the same time engaging your core (stomach) by pressing your naval towards your spine. The knees bending directly above the line of the toes without releasing the heels from the floor. As soon as the bottom of the bend is reached, the bend is reversed and the legs are straightened.

In grand plié, (in first, second, fourth, and fifth position) While doing a grand-plié position one must remember to have proper alignment. Head over shoulders, shoulders over hips over knees and knees over feet. When initiating a grand-plié one must pull up and resist against going down. Lengthening from the center and back of the head and pressing down through the floor through the balls of the feet. As you are bending your knees you have to maintain the proper alignment and make sure that the knees are going over the big toe. Heels come off the ground past demi-plié with the feet ending in a demi-pointe at the bottom of the bend. Making sure to create proper turn out by rotating the inner thighs forward and you go down. Making sure to keep the pelvis in line as you go down and up so that you do not release your seat and stick your chest forward, and at the same time engaging your core(stomach) by pressing your navel towards your spine. As soon as the bottom of the bend is reached, the bend is reversed and the legs are straightened. *Note: Heels do not come up off the floor in a second position.
===Pointe, en===

() Supporting one&#x27;s body weight on the tips of the toes, usually while wearing structurally reinforced pointe shoes.

===Pointe technique===
The part of classical ballet technique that concerns pointe work (dancing on the tips of the toes).

===Pointe work===
Performing steps while on the tips of the toes, with feet fully extended and wearing pointe shoes, a structurally reinforced type of shoe designed specifically for this purpose. Most often performed by women.

=== Poisson ===
(; literally &#x27;fish.&#x27;) A body position in which the back is arched and legs are crossed in fifth position or the working leg is held retiré. This position may be assumed while jumping or in partnering lifts, as in a fish dive.

===Port de bras===
(; &#x27;carriage of the arms.&#x27;) An exercise for the movement of the arms (and in some schools, the upper body) to different positions. For example, a basic &quot;port de bras&quot; exercise could move from fifth &quot;en bas&quot; (&#x27;low&#x27;) (i.e. &quot;bras bas&quot; or &quot;preparatory position&quot;) to first arm position, to second arm position, back down to fifth en bas. A full &quot;port de bras&quot; could move from &quot;en bas&quot; to &quot;en haut&quot; (&#x27;high&#x27;, i.e. overhead) and back down. Port de bras movements vary by school and by action.

The phrase &quot;port de bras&quot; is used in some schools and parts of the world to indicate a bending forward, backward, or circularly of the body at the waist, generally to be followed by bringing the upper body back to center/upright again, e.g. &quot;port de bras forward&quot;, &quot;port de bras back&quot;, &quot;circular port de bras/grand port de bras&quot;. Bending at the waist is otherwise known as cambré.

===Posé===
; A term of the Cecchetti school and RAD. From a &quot;fondu&quot;, a dancer steps with a straight leg onto an &quot;en pointe&quot; or &quot;demi-pointe&quot; foot, then brings the working leg to &quot;cou-de-pied&quot;, so that if the step is repeated, the working leg will execute a &quot;petit développé&quot;. This can be done in any direction or turning (the later also known as tour piqué).

===Positions of the arms===
There are two basic positions of the arms. In one, the dancer keeps the fingers of both arms almost touching to form an oval/round shape, either near the hips, at navel level, or raised above the dancer&#x27;s head. In the other, the arms are extended to the sides with the elbows slightly bent. These positions may be combined to give other positions.

Different schools, such as Vaganova, French, and Cecchetti, Russian often use different names for similar arm positions. The Russian school names three arm positions while the other schools name five.
* Bras bas (&#x27;arms low&#x27;) (RAD)/bras au repos (&#x27;at rest&#x27;) (French), preparatory position (Rus.), or fifth en bas (Cecc.) holds the arms low and slightly rounded near the hip.
* First position holds the arms round or oval in front of the body somewhere between the naval and breastbone (depending on the school and movement), the fingertips of the hands approaching each other. In Cecchetti, the hands stay a little lower at tutu height.
* Second position in all schools holds the arms extended out to the side, the inner part of the upper arm parallel to the ground with the forearms and palms facing the audience. The roundness and shoulder height of the arms varies by school.
* Third position in the French/RAD schools holds one arm in second with the other arm in first. The Russian equivalent of this may be &quot;petit bras&quot;.
** Third position in Cecchetti holds one arm in a Cecchetti first and the other arm in &quot;demi-seconde&quot;.
** Third position in the Russian school holds both arms slightly rounded overhead. This is equivalent to fifth position (en haut) in other schools.
* Fourth position or fourth &quot;ouvert&quot; (&#x27;open&#x27;) consists of one arm &quot;en haut&quot; (&#x27;high,&#x27; i.e. raised overhead) and the other open to second position. This is called &quot;fourth en haut&quot; in Cecchetti. The Russian school does not designate a fourth position; the Russian equivalent may be &quot;grand bras&quot;.
** Fourth position &quot;croisé&quot; (&#x27;crossed&#x27;) or &quot;Spanish fourth&quot; in Cecchetti consists of one arm &quot;en haut&quot; and the other held in first position/Cecchetti &quot;fifth en avant&quot;.
* Fifth position in the French/RAD schools and &quot;fifth en haut&quot; in Cecchetti holds the arms &quot;en haut&quot; slightly rounded, fingertips approaching each other. This is called third position in the Russian school, which does not designate a fifth (or fourth) position. Cecchetti also recognizes a &quot;fifth en bas&quot;, the preparatory/bras bas position in other schools, and a &quot;fifth en avant&quot;, arms rounded between naval/chest height, known as first position in other schools.

Additionally:
* Demi-bras (&#x27;half arms&#x27;) holds the arms between first and second position, outstretched with palms presented towards the audience.
* Demi-seconde (&#x27;half second&#x27;) holds the arms low out to the side as if grazing the tutu, palms generally down.

===Positions of the body===
There are eight to eleven positions of the body in ballet, eight in Cecchetti and RAD and ten or eleven in the Russian and French schools. The general positions are croisé, à la quatrième, effacé, à la seconde, écarté, and épaulé. Cecchetti and RAD&#x27;s eight include &quot;croisé devant, à la quatrième devant, effacé (devant), à la seconde, croisé derrière, écarté, épaulé,&quot; and &quot;à la quatrième derrière&quot;. The Russian school further divides &quot;effacé&quot; and &quot;épaulé&quot; into &quot;effacé devant, effacé derrière, épaulé devant&quot;, and &quot;épaulé derrière&quot;, and the Russian arm positions on &quot;croisé derrière&quot; are the converse of Cecchetti/RAD&#x27;s. In addition, the French school further divides &quot;écarté&quot; into &quot;écarté devant&quot; and &quot;écarté derrière&quot;.

===Positions of the feet===
The standard, basic placements of feet on the floor. Modern-day classical ballet employs five positions, known as the first position, second position, third position, fourth position, and fifth position.

===Pulling Up===
Pulling up is critical to the simple act of rising up on balance and involves the use of the entire body. The feeling of being simultaneously grounded and &quot;pulled up&quot; is necessary for many steps in ballet. To pull up, a dancer must lift the ribcage and sternum but keep the shoulders down, relaxed and centered over the hips, which requires use of the abdominal muscles. In addition, the dancer must stabilize the pelvis, maintaining a neutral position, and keep the back straight to avoid arching and going off balance.

===Petit Battement===

Petit battement is when a ballet dancer swiftly moves his/her leg in front then behind their calf. This motion is normally done at the barre during warm-up. A more advanced dancer would only move their knee, to complete this action.

==Q==

===Quatre===
() Four of something, as in &quot;pas de quatre&quot; (a dance by four dancers).

===Quatrième===
() Meaning &#x27;fourth&#x27;.

==R==

===Renversé===
() An attitude presented on a turn.

===Relevé===

(; &#x27;raised, lifted.&#x27;) Rising onto the balls (&quot;demi-pointe&quot;) or toes (&quot;pointe&quot;) of one or both feet. See also élevé.

===Relevé lent===
(; &#x27;lifted slowly.&#x27;) Abbreviation of &quot;battement relevé lent&quot;. Term from the Russian school indicating raising the leg slowly from pointe tendue to 45 degrees or higher off the ground. Contrasts with &quot;(battement) tendu jeté&quot;, aka &quot;dégagé&quot;, in which the leg brushes out propulsively from a high position through tendu to elevated off the ground, and &quot;(temps) développé&quot;, in which the leg passes through retiré (or petit retiré) to &quot;à la hauteur&quot; or &quot;demi-hauteur&quot;, i.e. elevated off the ground.
===Retiré===

() A position of the working leg in which the leg is raised turned out and bent at the knee to the side so that the toe is located directly in front of (retiré devant) or behind (retiré derrière) the supporting knee. This is commonly used in pirouettes and as an intermediate position in other movements such as &quot;développé&quot; front.

===Révérence===
(; &#x27;reverence, bow.&#x27;) A bow, curtsy, or grand gesture of respect to acknowledge the teacher and the pianist after class or the audience and orchestra after a performance. After a classical ballet, a bow or choreographed révérence may be performed in character.

===Revoltade===
() A bravura jump in which one lands on the leg from which one pushes off after that leg travels around the other leg which is lifted to a level that is parallel with the floor. There are several variants, the passing leg may pass around the lifted leg in a passé position, or it may be extended and parallel to the lifted leg, or it may be extended and close to perpendicular to the lifted leg. This last variant is also known as a 540.
===Rond de jambe===
(; meaning &#x27;leg circle.&#x27;) Half-circle made by the pointed foot, from fourth front or back through second position to the opposite fourth and returning through first position again to repeat, in effect tracing out the letter &quot;D&quot;. Starting front going back is called &quot;rond de jambe en dehors&quot; while starting back and going front is called &quot;rond de jambe en dedans&quot;.
*Rond de jambe à terre/par terre: (&#x27;on the ground.&#x27;) The extended leg with pointed toe remains on the ground to sweep around in a semi-circle.
*Rond de jambe attitude: the leg is swung around from front to side and into attitude position behind as the supporting foot goes en pointe. (See also attitude.)
*Rond de jambe en l&#x27;air: (&#x27;in the air.&#x27;) The leg is lifted and sustained to the side (&quot;à la seconde&quot;), with movement being limited to below the knee. If the thigh is held at 90 degrees from the body, the toe draws a circle approximately between the knee of the supporting leg and second position in the air. If the thigh is held lower (e.g. 45 degrees), the circle is drawn to the calf of the supporting leg. This is commonly done in singles, doubles, and/or sauté.
*Grand rond de jambe (en l&#x27;air): the leg is extended and sustained at &quot;grand battement&quot; height to draw a semi-circle in the air.
*Demi-grand rond de jambe (en l&#x27;air): the leg is extended and sustained off the ground while moving from fourth devant or derrière to second or vice versa, thus drawing only half of the full semi-circle.

===Royale===
() Another name for &quot;changement battu.&quot; A changement with a beating of the legs preceding the foot change. Example: with the right foot in front in fifth position, plié, jump, beat the right thigh against the left (back thigh) and continue with a changement moving the right leg to behind the left, landing fifth position left foot front.

==S==

===Sauté===
(; literally &#x27;jumped.&#x27;) Used to indicate a step executed jumping, e.g. &quot;sauté arabesque&quot; is an &quot;arabesque&quot; performed while jumping on the supporting leg.

===Saut de chat===
() In RAD and American ballet, &quot;saut de chat&quot; refers to a jump similar to a grand jeté differing in that the front leg extends through a développé instead of a grand battement. This is called a &quot;grand jété développé&quot; in other schools.

In the French and Cecchetti schools, &quot;saut de chat&quot; refers to what RAD/ABT call a &quot;pas de chat&quot;.

=== Scáfuri ===
A rise, from flat to demi-pointe (from the balls to the tips of both feet), usually done multiple times in quick succession where the legs are turned out in a grand pas position.

===Second position (feet)===
Legs turned out with feet pointing in opposite directions and heels at least shoulder-width apart.

===Sickle===
A term that refers to the reverse of a winging, indicating a foot where the heel is too far back so the toes are in front of the ankle and heel, breaking the line of the leg at the ankle. If a dancer sickles an &quot;en pointe&quot; or &quot;demi-pointe&quot; foot, the ankle could collapse to the outside, resulting in a sprain. A working foot should be straight to the side and mildly winged to the front or back.

===Sissonne===

() Although commonly thought to mean a scissor step, sissonnes are in fact named after the originator of the step.
There are many types of sissonne, but all push off the floor with two feet and land on one. 
A sissone simple/ ordinaire devant starts in fifth position, shows fifth position in the air and lands in cou-de-pied devant. A sissonne fermée (close) has the dancer perform a medium to large jump from two feet, springing in any direction and leaving an extended leg behind, the ‘fermé’ is then a fast closing of the extended leg back into fifth position. A sissonne ouverte (open) will finish in the extended position. 
Advanced dancers can often be seen splitting their legs in a sissonne fermée and ouverte, this has perhaps led to some believing sissonne to be a ‘scissor step’. For reference, ‘scissors’ in French is ‘Ciseaux’ [see-ZOH]. 
Pas de ciseaux [pah duh see-ZOH] - a scissor step, is in advanced step in which following a temps levé from the left leg with the right leg devant, the legs pass each other at the height of the jump and the left leg is then immediately thrust backwards to land on the right leg with the left leg in arabesque (en fondue).

===Soubresaut===
() A sudden spring or small jump from both feet, traveling forward in either first, third, or fifth position and landing on both feet in the same position as they started.

===Sous-sous===
(; literally &#x27;under-under.&#x27;) A relevé, or rise, into a tight fifth position, feet touching and ankles crossed, giving the appearance of one foot with two heels. A term from the Cecchetti school, sus-sous (&#x27;over-under&#x27;) is the equivalent term in the French and Russian schools.

===Soutenu en tournant===
(; &#x27;sustained.&#x27;) Similar to &quot;tours chaînés (déboulés)&quot;, a &quot;soutenu&quot; turn is a turn usually done in multiples in quick succession. The dancer first executes a &quot;demi-plié&quot; while extending the leading leg in &quot;tendu&quot;, stepping onto that leg en pointe/demi-pointe (making it the standing leg), then bringing the other leg to fifth position in front of the standing leg and finally turning (effectively, an unwinding motion). At the end of the rotation, the originally crossed-over foot in front should now be in fifth position behind.

Common abbreviation of &quot;assemblé soutenu en tournant&quot; (Cecc.). This is known as a &quot;glissade en tourant&quot; in the Russian school.

When done at the barre en demi-pointe to switch sides, only half a turn is done instead of a full turn, and the foot does not extend out into tendu. Differs from a &quot;détourné&quot; in that there is a repositioning of the feet on finishing (and a crossing action, if not initiated in fifth) vs. just a pivot to half turn.

===Split===
A configuration of the legs in which the legs are extended in opposite directions, either to the side (&quot;straddle&quot; split) or with one leg forward and the other back (&quot;front&quot; split). This is employed in various movements, including grand jeté and arabesque penchée.

===Sur le cou-de-pied===
(; literally &#x27;on the neck of the foot.&#x27;) The arched working foot is placed wrapped at the part of the leg between the base of the calf and the beginning of the ankle. On the accent devant (front), the heel of the working foot is placed in front of the leg, while the toes point to the back, allowing the instep (&quot;cou-de-pied&quot; in French) of the working foot to hug the lower leg. On the accent derrière (back), the heel of the working leg is placed behind the leg with the toes pointing to the back. The action of alternating between devant and derrière is seen in a petit battement.

==T==

===Tendu===

(; literally &#x27;stretched.&#x27;) Gradually extending the working leg to the front (&quot;tendu devant&quot;), side, or back, passing from flat to demi-pointe to point where only the toes are touching the floor (&quot;tendu à terre&quot;), or only the pointed toes are elevated (&quot;en l&#x27;air&quot;). A common abbreviation for &quot;battement tendu&quot;.

===Tights===
Most ballet dancers wear tights in practices and performances unless in some contemporary and character dances or variations.

===Temps levé===
(; literally &#x27;time raised.&#x27;) A term from the Cecchetti school indicating a hop on one foot while the other is raised in any position. The instep is fully arched when leaving the ground and the spring must come from the pointing of the toe and the extension of the leg after the &quot;demi-plié&quot;.

In the Cecchetti method, the specifically indicates a spring from fifth position while raising one foot to &quot;sur le cou-de-pied&quot;. In the Russian and French schools, this is known as &quot;sissonne simple&quot;.

===Temps levé sauté===
(; literally &#x27;time raised jumped.&#x27;) A term from the Russian school. This can be executed with both feet from first, second, third, fourth, or fifth position starting with a &quot;demi-plié&quot;, leading to a jump in the air that lands with the feet in the same position as they started. (Otherwise known as simply a &quot;saut&quot; or &quot;sauté&quot;.) This can also be performed from one foot, while the other maintains the same position it had before starting the jump (i.e. the same as &quot;temps levé&quot;).

===Temps lié===
(; &#x27;time linked.&#x27;) A term indicating the transfer of weight from one leg to another by shifting through to the position without any sort of gliding or sliding movement.

===Tours en l&#x27;air===

(; literally &#x27;turn in the air.&#x27;) A jump, typically done by males, with a full rotation in the air. The landing can be on both feet, on one leg with the other extended in &quot;attitude&quot; or &quot;arabesque&quot;, or down on one knee as at the end of a variation. A single &quot;tour&quot; is a 360° rotation, a double is 720°. Vaslav Nijinsky was known to perform triple &quot;tours en l&#x27;air&quot;.

===Tombé===
(; literally &#x27;fallen.&#x27;) The action of falling, typically used as a lead-in movement to a traveling step, e.g. &quot;pas de bourrée&quot;. A &quot;tombé en avant&quot; begins with a &quot;coupé&quot; to the front moving to a dégagé to fourth position devant, the extended foot coming down to the floor with the leg en plié, shifting the weight of the body onto the front leg and lifting the back leg off the floor in dégagé (to fourth derrière). A &quot;tombé&quot; through second starts with a dégagé of the leading leg to second position, the leading foot coming to the floor with the leg in plié, and the trailing leg lifting off the floor in dégagé to (the opposite-side) second position. A &quot;tombé en avant&quot; can also be initiated with a small sliding hop instead of a coupé.

In the Vaganova school, the full term is &quot;sissonne ouverte tombée&quot;.

===Triple Runs===
One big step, followed by two little steps, that can be done in a circle.

===Turnout===

Rotation of the legs at the hips, resulting in knees and feet facing away from each other.

===Tutu===
A classic ballet skirt, typically flat at the waist or hip level, made of several layers of tulle or tarlatan.

==V==

=== Variation ===
A dance typically done solo.

=== Virtuoso ===
A dancer with great technical ability and skill.

==W==

===Waltz===
A sequence of steps performed in sync with waltz music, as in &quot;pas de waltz en tournant&quot;.

<text>A drain cleaner, also known as drain opener, refers to a person, device, or product used to unblock sewer pipes or clear clogged wastewater drains. This term typically applies to chemical, enzymatic, or mechanical tools such as commercial chemical cleaners, plumber’s snakes, drain augers, bio-enzyme solutions, or toilet plungers. In some contexts, it may also refer to a plumber or professional who specializes in drain cleaning and maintenance. 

Chemical drain cleaners, plungers, handheld drain augers, and air burst drain cleaners are typically used to address clogs in single drain, such as sinks, toilets, tubs, or shower drains. These tools are effective at removing soft obstructions like hair and grease that accumulate near the drain inlet. However, excessive use of chemical drain cleaners can lead to pipe damage. In contrast, enzymatic drain cleaners rely on natural enzymes to break down organic matter such as grease, hair, and food particles, offering a more environmentally friendly solution that avoids harsh chemicals.

If more than one plumbing fixture is clogged then electric drain cleaners, battery powered drain cleaners, sewer jetters or such mechanical devices are usually required to clear obstructions along the entire length of the drain piping system, that is, from fixture drain inlets through the main building drains and lateral piping outside the building to the collector sewer mains.

== History ==
The history of drain cleaners parallels the development of common drain systems themselves. As a result, there is not an extensive history of cleaners in the US, as municipal plumbing systems were not readily available in middle-class American homes until the early 20th century. Prior to this time, Americans often discarded the dirty water collected in basins after use. Limited piping systems gradually developed with lead materials, but after WWI when the poisonous properties of lead became more well-known, piping was reconstructed with galvanized iron.

Galvanized iron is actually steel covered in a protective layer of zinc, but it was soon discovered that this zinc layer naturally corroded due to exposure to the atmosphere and rainwater, as well as cement, runoff, etc. Once corrosion occurred down to the base metal, porous plaques and rust would form, leading to sediment build-up that would gradually clog these drains.

The problems with corroding galvanized iron pipes eventually led to their replacement by copper or plastic (PVC) piping by the 1960s. Natural substances such as hair, grease, or other oils continued to be an issue in drain clogs, encouraging the development of chemical drain cleaners as well as mechanical tools to clear drains.

==Chemical drain openers==

These commercial products usually contain corrosive acids or alkalis to unclog organic materials, including proteins, lipids and carbohydrates. 

==Enzyme drain cleaners==
Enzyme drain cleaners are biodegradable cleaning solutions designed to clear clogs and maintain drainage systems by employing natural enzymatic reactions. 

The enzymatic process facilitates the decomposition of these materials into smaller, water-soluble molecules, which are then more easily flushed without harming the plumbing infrastructure or the environment. While enzyme drain cleaners are effective for regular maintenance and preventing minor clogs, they may not be suitable for severe blockages.

==Handheld drain augers==

Handheld drain augers are typically designed to clean portions of a drain within of the drain opening. The springy, flexible cable of a handheld drain auger is pushed into a drain while the operator rotates a drum that anchors the cable. Similar to handheld augers, drain rods can be used for clearing blockages in long, straight runs of pipe.

Many handheld augers have cables which are thin enough to pass through common sink traps, but manufacturers do not recommend using handheld drain augers in toilets because of their potential to scratch ceramic surfaces. Instead, a special closet auger (from &quot;water closet&quot;) should be used.

Advantages of handheld drain augers include low relative cost and ready availability of these tools in hardware stores. However, drawbacks include a reach that is normally limited to , and the potential for the twisting cable to scratch the ceramic surfaces of plumbing fixtures. They are also only effective on small-diameter pipes () rather than main sewer pipes ().

Safety considerations include protective gloves and eye protection, and practicing good hygiene after coming into contact with drain fluids.

==Air burst drain cleaners==

Air burst drain cleaners use accelerated carbon dioxide, air or other gas to rupture the clog membrane. Accelerated gas creates a force on standing water that can dislodge clogs that accumulate close to drain openings.

Advantages of air burst drain cleaners include the potential to immediately clear clogs and slow-running drains, in contrast to chemical cleaners that can take more time to work. Air burst cleaners can dislodge obstructions that are further away from drain openings than can a plunger, and in contrast to drain augers do not risk scratching the ceramic surfaces of sinks, bathtubs and toilets.

Disadvantages of air burst drain cleaners include a limited cleaning range in pipes that do not contain standing water and, in general, ineffectiveness for unclogging blocked main sewer drains.

Safety considerations for air burst drain cleaners include a requirement to wear eye protection and, when using an air burst cleaner that uses compressed gas cartridges, careful handling of unused cartridges.

==Hydro-mechanical drain cleaners==
Hydro-mechanical drain cleans use high-pressure water to break up obstructions and flush these smaller particles down the drain.

Most municipal building codes mandate that drain plumbing increase in diameter as it moves closer to the municipal sewer system. i.e., most kitchen sinks evacuate water with a -inch drain pipe, which feeds into a larger 4-inch drain pipe on the main plumbing stack before heading to a septic tank or to the city sewage system. This means that, barring intrusion by tree roots or other debris into buried piping, the vast majority of household drain clogs occur in the smallest-diameter piping, usually in the pop-up or drain trap, where they can be reached easily by a hydro-mechanical device&#x27;s water hose.

Advantages of hydro-mechanical drain cleaners are their eco-friendliness (most use only tap water), their ability to dislodge and remove clogs like sand or cat litter that &#x27;back-fill when using a conventional snake, and their friendliness to plumbing joints. Unlike air-burst cleaners, hydro-mechanical drain cleaners do not pressurize plumbing joints. On some models of hydro-mechanical drain cleaner both hot and cold water can be used, providing added cleaning power for fat, protein, or other easily melting drain clogs.

Disadvantages of hydro-mechanical drain cleaners included limited reach into drain plumbing, and the necessity of a water source to act as the motive agent.

Safety considerations for hydro-mechanical drain cleaners include the risk of injury from high-pressure water coming into contact with skin or delicate areas of the body (i.e., eyes, and face).

== Electric drain cleaners ==

Electric drain cleaners, also called plumber&#x27;s snakes, use the mechanical force of an electric motor to twist a flexible cable or spring in a clockwise direction and drive it into a pipe. Electric drain cleaners are commonly available with cable lengths of up to and can go as far as 

Advantages of electric drain cleaners include the ability to clean long sections of sewer drain, the ability to remove solid objects such as tree roots and jewelry, and ready availability through hardware stores and tool rental counters. Machines using springs can easily negotiate multiple 90-degree bends while maintaining their effectiveness and without damaging the pipe.

Disadvantages of electric drain cleaners include high relative cost and weight, and the considerable physical effort that may be required to control the cable.

Safety considerations for electric drain cleaners include the requirement to wear work gloves and eye protection, to carefully control the cable during operation to avoid overstressing it, to use appropriate caution when working around rotating machinery, and to use properly grounded electrical outlets.

== Battery powered drain cleaners ==

==Sewer jetters==


Sewer jetting is the process of shooting high powered streams of water through the drain, down into the sewer in order to blast away any debris blocking the passage of water. This is more effective than using a snake, blades, or even drain rods because, first the water is shot at such a high intensity that the force isn&#x27;t even comparable to manual labour, secondly the water is much more capable of bending around curved or angular pipes to reach all the tight spots.

A sewer jetter is composed of a controlled high-pressure water source such as a pressure washer or reciprocating displacement pump, a flexible high-pressure line (called a jetter hose, which connects the high-pressure engine to the mini-reel) of up to hundreds of metres (several hundred feet) in length, the Mini-Reel (a hose reel which can be taken a distance from the engine) and a nozzle that uses hydraulic force to pull the line into sewer drains, clean the sides of pipes, and flush out residue. High-pressure sewer jetters can be mounted on trolleys, inside vans or on trailers. The power of a sewer jetter ranges from to . 

Sewer jetter nozzles come in different sizes and applications; a bullet-type nozzle with a streamlined profile can clear a hole for the larger root cutting nozzle. Root-cutter nozzles are designed to cut roots with a spinning nozzle that shoots a jet stream horizontally inside the pipe. High pressure sewer jetters with root-cutting nozzles can clear a hole through the center of a root-infested sewer line and with its rear-facing jet streams cut the roots and clean the pipe walls, flushing the root debris through the sewer line. The sewer jetter has been labeled as a technological advancement of the plumber&#x27;s snake (also known as an electric eel) drain clearing method.

Portable sewer jetters and pressure washer sewer jetter attachments are primarily used by service personnel and homeowners to remove soft obstructions throughout the length of a building&#x27;s sewer drain and to prevent the recurrence of clogs by cleaning the sides of drain pipes and flushing out residue. Pressure washer sewer jetter attachments are generally lower in cost and weight than electric drain cleaners with an equivalent reach, and can present a lower risk of scratching plumbing fixtures.

Truck and trailer-mounted sewer jetters used by municipalities and larger service companies benefit from the high hydraulic horsepower delivered by powerful displacement pumps and so can remove tree roots and other solid obstructions.

Advantages of sewer jetters include the relative ease of penetrating long sewer lines and the ability to remove residue that accumulates along the sides of sewer pipes, thereby reducing the need for subsequent drain cleaning.

Disadvantages of pressure washer sewer jetter attachments and many portable jetters include an inability to extract tree roots and other hard obstructions. Disadvantages of truck- and trailer-mounted sewer jetters include high relative cost and weight, and the requirement for extensive training to comply with manufacturers&#x27; safety guidelines.

Safety considerations for sewer jetters include a requirement to wear protective gloves and eye protection, to avoid contact with sewer drain fluids, and to ensure that the jetter nozzle operates only inside the sewer pipe. Furthermore, larger truck- and trailer-mounted units that operate with sufficient power to cut tree roots require extensive training and strict adherence to manufacturers&#x27; safety guidelines to avoid serious injury.

<text>The Simple Life is an American reality television series starring Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie. It depicts the two wealthy socialites, as they struggle to do menial, low-paying jobs such as cleaning rooms, farm work, serving meals in fast-food restaurants, and working as camp counselors. The series premiered on December 2, 2003, on Fox, and concluded on August 5, 2007, on E!. A falling-out between Hilton and Richie in 2005 led the series to be cancelled by Fox following its third season. It was eventually picked up by E!, which aired its fourth and fifth seasons. &quot;The Simple Life&quot; helped catapult Hilton and Richie into international stardom, and maintained a consistently high viewership throughout its run on both networks. It also spawned a number of international remakes.

==Series overview==

In the first season, Paris and Nicole agreed to leave behind their cellphones, credit cards and celebrity status to move in with the Leding family in Altus, Arkansas for a month. The second season follows the two socialites traveling across the United States in a pink pickup truck (driven by Paris), pulling an airstream trailer, and participating in such activities as catching craw fish, working as maids in a nudist resort, and sausage-making. In the third season, Paris and Nicole take various internships with companies along the East Coast of the United States. For the fourth season, both women alternated in the &quot;wife&quot; role to a different family every episode, in a similar manner to &quot;Wife Swap&quot;. The fifth and final season follows Hilton and Richie working as counselors at Camp Shawnee. 

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==Production and broadcast==
===Development===

The idea for &quot;The Simple Life&quot; was generated in Fox&#x27;s comedy department. Brad Johnson, Senior Vice President of comedy development, said &quot;The Simple Life&quot; was born out of a challenge from Fox Television Entertainment Group Chairman, Sandy Grushow, and News Corp. President and Chief Operating Officer, Peter Chernin, to find another way to do comedies outside of the traditional sitcom format. 

&quot;The areas that seemed simplest and cleanest was to go back to those high-concept 1960s sitcoms and say let&#x27;s do them for real&quot;, Johnson said. &quot;The Simple Life&quot; was inspired by &quot;Green Acres&quot;, a sitcom about a New York society couple who moved to a farm. Johnson said they originally thought of moving an entire family to the South. Cameras would observe as the former socialites, deprived of access to their bank accounts and Beemers, attempt to get a job, buy groceries, and fit in with average Americans. At the same time the comedy department was developing the idea, Paris Hilton was meeting with the studio&#x27;s casting department. Sharon Klein, senior VP of casting at the studio, said she was immediately fascinated by Hilton and wanted to do a show with her. &quot;I&#x27;m used to meeting with actors who are putting on a facade&quot;, Klein said. &quot;She was so real. She was funny. At that first meeting she did not come off stupid. She was in her own reality and not embarrassed to talk about it. There was a sweetness to her.&quot;

The two departments talked and realized they had their show: Send Paris Hilton and her sister Nicky, who had never worked a day in their lives, to live and work on a farm. At the time, the studio was working closely with Mike Darnell, head of reality programming at Fox, who liked the idea. &quot;They wanted to see stilettos in cow shit,&quot; Klein said. Paris was convinced to come on board, however Nicky, being somewhat shy to the limelight at the time, opted out. Paris told some media that she was in talks to do the show by herself, but ultimately, Fox decided the city-living cast had to be a duo. Paris allegedly asked several close friends on board, including Kimberly Stewart and Band Aid heiress, Casey Johnson. After Johnson declined, Hilton ended up making the agreement with Nicole Richie.

===Production and initial airing on Fox===
Fox hired Bunim-Murray Productions to produce the series. The first season was filmed from April to May 2003, in Altus, Arkansas, and the 8-episode first season premiered on December 2, 2003. During its airing, Fox added two extra episodes, one of which was a reunion special. The second season was filmed from March to April 2004, and aired from June 16 to August 5, 2004, and consisted of 10 episodes (plus a television special). The special, titled &quot;The Simple Life – The Stuff We Weren&#x27;t Allowed To Show You&quot;, aired on November 17, 2004. It showcased several cut scenes from the season (some of which appear on its DVD release) as well as preview clips for the third season. Filming for the third season took place from October to November 2004. It aired from January 25 to May 12, 2005, consisting of 16 episodes.

===Fox cancellation and move to E!===
In an interview with &quot;USA Today&quot;, Hilton confirmed the rumor that she and Nicole were no longer friends, and that Nicole would not be part of the fourth season. However, Fox Network head Peter Ligouri told the 2005 Television Critics Association press tour in Los Angeles that Paris and Nicole were actually both contracted for another two seasons, and that Paris and Nicole are, in his words &quot;TV professionals, who will be ready to work together when the time comes.&quot; Fox ultimately canceled its plans for any further seasons of &quot;The Simple Life&quot; in October 2005, both because it had filled its mid-season show quota, and because Paris and Nicole had had the falling out as friends.

After it was dropped by Fox, other networks, such as NBC, UPN, The WB, VH1, and MTV were all reported to be interested in obtaining the rights to air new seasons of the show. On November 28, 2005, E! announced that they had picked up &quot;The Simple Life&quot; and had ordered production go ahead on the fourth season, along with the rights to re-air the first three seasons. Filming for the new season began February 27, 2006. It premiered on June 5, 2006. The fifth and final season of &quot;The Simple Life&quot; debuted on Memorial Day, on May 28, 2007, and ended on August 5, 2007.

===Final cancellation by E!===
On July 30, 2007, E! announced that they had canceled the show, stating: &quot;&quot;The Simple Life&quot; has been a wonderful addition to the E! Schedule for two years and we will always be grateful to Paris and Nicole for their hard work and graciousness.&quot; That day, at the premiere of &quot;Rush Hour 3&quot;, Hilton herself said that, &quot;It&#x27;s been a great five years and we had so much fun, but I&#x27;m happy to end it at that,&quot; suggesting she had opted out of any continuation of the series. Distribution rights to &quot;The Simple Life&quot; are held by Disney-ABC Domestic Television.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Despite a significant criticism of reality television and the scrutiny that both Hilton and Richie faced throughout &quot;The Simple Life&quot; run, the series received moderately positive reviews from critics, who generally highlighted its tongue-in-cheek humour in spite of its vacuous nature. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the first season an approval rating of 69% based on 16 reviews. The site&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;&quot;The Simple Life&quot; is an incredibly vapid show, but there is no denying that Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie are downright entertaining.&quot; Writing for &quot;Variety&quot;, Brian Lowry considered that the series was &quot;made palatable and watchable because the primary objects of derision are heiress/party girls Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie. Easy-to-promote concept plays like a light-hearted romp, where mercifully [...] nobody has learned much of anything&quot;. Ken Tucker, for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, gave the series a &quot;B&quot; rating and asserted that &quot;the producers know precisely what tone to take&quot;. &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; editor Melanie McFarland remarked: &quot;Hilton and Richie try to bring Beverly fabulousness, and brattiness, to the country folk. They fail miserably. We all get a good laugh. At least their unapologetic shallowness and good-natured mental incapacity carry the thing through&quot;.

===U.S. television ratings===
The December 2, 2003 debut of &quot;The Simple Life&quot; drew 13 million viewers, increasing Fox&#x27;s adults 18-49 rating a &quot;phenomenal&quot; 79%. The second episode showed a growth in ratings, reaching 13.3 million viewers. An audience of 9.8 million viewers watched the series&#x27; second-season premiere on June 16, 2004. After moving to E!, the series&#x27; fourth season premiered on June 4, 2006, drawing 1.3 million viewers. While &quot;those ratings would have been dismal for Fox, it was actually more than four times E!&#x27;s prime-time average&quot;. According to &quot;TV Week&quot;, &quot;ratings more than tripled from the network&#x27;s average&quot; in key adult demographic groups.

===Awards and recognition===
==Home media==
&quot;The Simple Life&quot; first season received a DVD release in the United States on January 20, 2004, which included the bonus episode and the reunion episode. The second season was released to DVD on November 2, 2004, and was accompanied by a CD-soundtrack. The DVD of the third season was released in the United States on March 19, 2006. The series&#x27; first and fourth seasons were added to the iTunes Store on July 28, 2006. The fourth season was officially released to DVD on December 26, 2006. The fifth and final season&#x27;s DVD was released on January 22, 2008. It contained no special features and not even the extended version of the first episode that was only shown on the premiere. This season also became available for download on iTunes, where a compilation of camp songs dubbed &quot;The Simple Life: Camp Songs&quot; was released on August 13, 2007.

==Media impact ==
===International remakes===

Paris and Nicole&#x27;s rural misadventures on &quot;The Simple Life&quot; proved so popular with U.S. viewers that a number of international remakes have been produced. 

===Spin-offs===

In 2005, NBC produced a reality series titled &quot;I Want To Be a Hilton&quot;, which took the idea of &quot;The Simple Life&quot;, and reversed it. Hosted by Kathy Hilton, Paris&#x27; mom, the show saw several contestants from rural country and suburban areas having to perform certain tasks ranging from dog grooming to a fashion show and organizing a charity event, while learning etiquette and manners. The finalist of the competition received a prize package that included a $200,000 trust fund, a new apartment, wardrobe and the opportunity to live the life of high society for one year. Paris and Nicky guest starred in an episode, and Paris&#x27;s dog Tinkerbell (who appeared in &quot;The Simple Life&quot;) also took part. 

A new incarnation of &quot;The Simple Life&quot; nearly occurred, in a developed spin-off that, following negotiations, was set to air on E!, featuring Kelly Osbourne and Kimberly Stewart in Paris and Nicole&#x27;s shoes. However, the series was not picked up after Kelly opted out of the project following a few days&#x27; shooting, branding it &quot;demeaning and juvenile&quot;.

===Similar series===
&quot;The Simple Life&quot; has also been emulated by other television productions. E!&#x27;s &quot;Filthy Rich: Cattle Drive&quot; (2005) shared various unquestionable similarities with &quot;The Simple Life&quot;, and centered on sending several well-known young socialites (including Kourtney Kardashian and Brittny Gastineau, among others) to live on a rural ranch, minus cellphones and other luxuries they have come to swear by. MTV produced &quot;Exiled!&quot; (2008), which took eight former stars of &quot;My Super Sweet 16&quot;, who have grown up spoiled, self-involved and without any idea about real work, and sent them to live in third-world countries to teach them a lesson in how hard life can be for other people. 

In the United Kingdom, Channel 4 broadcast &quot;Princess Nikki&quot; (2006), a series based on the foundations of &quot;The Simple Life&quot;, starring reality television star Nikki Grahame, who rose to fame after her popularity on popular reality show &quot;Big Brother 7&quot;. This included Nikki taking on jobs such as being a farmer, an extreme cleaner and a sewage worker. South Korean television channel KBS2 has produced a reality-variety show, titled &quot;Invincible Youth&quot; (2009–2012) which is loosely based on &quot;The Simple Life&quot;, consisting of various K-pop girl group members.

<text>USS &quot;Pogy&quot; (SSN-647), a , was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the pogy, or menhaden.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Pogy&quot; was awarded on 23 March 1963, and her keel was laid down on 5 May 1964 by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation at Camden, New Jersey. She was launched on 3 June 1967, under the sponsorship of Mrs. George Wales. She was the last ship launched by New York Shipbuilding which went out of business shortly afterwards. On 5 June 1967, the contract for her construction was canceled, and she was towed to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in an incomplete state and laid up.

On 7 December 1967, the contract for construction of &quot;Pogy&quot; was reassigned to Ingalls Shipbuilding Corporation of Pascagoula, Mississippi, and the incomplete submarine was towed to that shipyard on 8 January 1968 for completion. Seven days underway, from Philadelphia to Pascagoula the tow line broke and Pogy was adrift. &quot;Pogy&quot; was commissioned on 15 May 1971. The seven-year time span from keel laying to commissioning was the longest construction time in history for an American submarine. This record was exceeded by USS Seawolf (SSN-21) when she was commissioned in July 1997.

==Service history==
&quot;Pogy&quot; put to sea on 22 April 1975 for local operations. On 27 April 1975, about off the coast of Oahu in the Hawaiian Islands, her lookout sighted a capsized sailboat drifting out to sea, and the crew quickly rescued the boat″s owner. He had been in the water for about an hour, and his only injuries were scrapes and bruises incurred while being hoisted up the rough side of the submarine. The same day, &quot;Pogy&quot; conducted SINKEX 1-75, a test of a warshot Mark 48 torpedo against a target submarine. She intercepted the decommissioned hulk of submarine drifting on the surface and carrying a noisemaker for the torpedo to home on acoustically. &quot;Pogy&quot; verified positions using her periscope, then dived to about to shoot the torpedo. Interior Communications Electrician IC1(SS) Joseph J. Varese, who had earned his Submarine Warfare insignia on &quot;Carbonero&quot;, and was now leading petty officer of &quot;Pogy&quot;″s Interior Communications Division, was given the honor of throwing the firing switch to shoot the torpedo. A few minutes later, &quot;Pogy&quot; transmitted the traditional message: &quot;SIGHTED SUBMARINE SANK SAME&quot;.


On 25 August 1996, &quot;Pogy&quot; deployed in support of SCICEX-96 experiments. In October 1996, she transited the Bering Strait and began collecting thousands of water samples from over a hundred locations under the polar ice cap in the Arctic Ocean. She continuously recorded ocean currents and water salinity and temperature, and surfaced 19 times through the ice cap to measure surface conditions before returning to San Diego, California, on 26 November 1996.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Pogy&quot; was decommissioned and simultaneously struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 11 June 1999. Her scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington, was completed on 12 April 2000.

==Commemoration==
&quot;Pogy&quot;″s diving plane fins can be seen as part of The Fin Project at Pelican Harbor Park in Miami, Florida.

Pogy&#x27;s Ballast Control Panel is on display at the Submarine Force Museum in Groton, CT. There is a plaque on the rear wall of the exhibit denoting it as such.

== USS &quot;Pogy&quot; in fiction ==
In the 1984 Tom Clancy novel &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;, &quot;Pogy&quot; and the attack submarine escort the fictitious defecting Soviet Navy ballistic missile submarine &quot;Red October&quot;. However, &quot;Pogy&quot; is not mentioned or depicted in the 1990 film &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;.

<text>The New Mexico Corrections Department (NMCD; ) is a state agency of New Mexico, headquartered in unincorporated Santa Fe County, near Santa Fe. It the department operates corrections facilities, probate and parole programs, a prisoner reentry services, and an offender database.

==Facilities and security levels==
This list includes detention facilities in New Mexico which house state prisoners. There are no federal prisons in New Mexico and the list does not include county jails located in the state.

==1980 riot==
&quot;See more: New Mexico State Penitentiary riot&quot;

The Penitentiary of New Mexico Prison Riot, which took place on the weekend of February 2 and 3, 1980, was the most violent prison riot to date in the history of the American prison system. During an inmate takeover lasting only 36 hours, 33 inmates were killed and 12 officers were held hostage by prisoners who had escaped from a dormitory in the main unit, the southern half of the prison. Inmates were brutally butchered, dismembered, burned alive with torches and hung up in the cell house for display. Although taking many years, this riot eventually led to several changes in New Mexico&#x27;s prison system, including a modern inmate classification system modeled after the U.S. Federal Bureau of Prisons, as well as the closing of the prison cellhouses and dormitories that were in use at the time of the riot.

<doc id="411541" wikidata="Q123086" url="?curid=411541" title="Hat-trick">
<text>A hat-trick or hat trick is the achievement of a generally positive feat three times in a match, or another achievement based on the number three.

==Origin==
The term first appeared in 1858 in cricket, to describe H. H. Stephenson taking three wickets with three consecutive deliveries. Fans held a collection for Stephenson, and presented him with a hat bought with the proceeds. The term was used in print for the first time in 1865 in the &quot;Chelmsford Chronicle&quot;. The term was eventually adopted by many other sports including hockey, association football, Formula 1 racing, rugby, and water polo.

==Use==

===Bat and ball games===

==== Baseball ====
In the past, the term was occasionally used to describe when a player struck out three times in a baseball game, and the term &quot;golden sombrero&quot; was more commonly used when a player struck out four times in a game.

In recent years, hat trick has been more often used to describe when a player hits three home runs in a game.

For example, on 29 August 2015, Toronto Blue Jays fans celebrated Edwin Encarnación&#x27;s third home run of the game by throwing hats onto the field, similar to the tradition in ice hockey.

==== Cricket ====

A hat-trick occurs in cricket when an individual bowler takes three wickets with consecutive deliveries in the same match.

=== Football codes ===

==== Association football ====
A hat-trick occurs in association football when a player scores three goals (not necessarily consecutive) in a single game, whereas scoring two goals (in a single match) is called a brace. In common with other official record-keeping rules, all goals scored during the regulation 90 minutes, plus extra time if required, are counted but goals in a penalty shootout are excluded from the tally. The fastest recorded time to score a hat-trick is 70 seconds, a record set by Alex Torr in a Sunday league game in 2013. The previous record of 90 seconds was held by Tommy Ross playing for Ross County against Nairn County on 28 November 1964. The record of the youngest player ever to score a hat-trick was set by Ntinos Pontikas in 1996, while Pelé in 1958 became the youngest to achieve a hat-trick in the FIFA World Cup.

The first hat-trick achieved in an international game was by Scottish player John McDougall, against England on 2 March 1878. German Erwin Helmchen scored 141 official hat-tricks in his career with Pelé having 92. American player Bert Patenaude scored the first hat-trick in the FIFA World Cup, against Paraguay in the inaugural event in 1930. Three hat-tricks have been scored in a World Cup final: by Geoff Hurst for England in the 1966 final against West Germany, by Carli Lloyd for the USA against Japan in the 2015 Women&#x27;s World Cup final and by Kylian Mbappé for France in the 2022 final against Argentina. Lloyd&#x27;s was, at 16 minutes, the fastest from kick-off in any World Cup match. However, the fastest World Cup hat-trick, as measured by time between goals, belongs to Fabienne Humm of Switzerland, who scored in the 47th, 49th and 52nd minutes against Ecuador in the 2015 group stage.

Traditionally, a player who scores a hat-trick is allowed to keep the match ball as a memento.

===== Perfect hat-trick =====
Football has also extended the term, with a perfect hat-trick being when a player scores one right-footed goal, one left-footed goal and one headed goal within one match. In Germany and Austria, the term &quot;() Hattrick&quot; (flawless hat-trick) refers to when a player scores three goals in a row in one half without the half-time break or a goal scored by another player interrupting the performance.

==== Gaelic football ====
In Gaelic football, a hat-trick can refer to goals &quot;or&quot; to points scored.

Eoin Liston scored a second-half hat-trick in the 1978 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final.

Michael Quinlivan scored a second-half hat-trick against Armagh in the final game of the 2017 National Football League to secure promotion to Division 2 for Tipperary.

Jack McCaffrey&#x27;s total of 1–3 in the 2019 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final (drawn game) involved a &quot;classic hat-trick&quot; of points, sent over the bar with fist and both feet.

Cillian O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s four goals (accompanied by nine points) in the 2020 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship semi-final at Croke Park broke the 5–3 record set by Johnny Joyce of Dublin in 1960 and matched with 3–9 by Rory Gallagher of Fermanagh in 2002 for the highest individual scorer in any championship football match.

David Clifford scored a hat-trick against Galway in the opening round of the 2021 National Football League.

==== Gridiron football ====
The term hat-trick is only occasionally used in gridiron football, usually for rhetorical flourish in sports writing. Usually an offensive player scoring three touchdowns in a single game is awarded a hat-trick.

Additionally, the term is applied to a defensive player, often an edge rusher, who in a single scrimmage play performs a sack which causes the quarterback to fumble, and then recovers that fumble. 

==== Rugby football ====
In both codes of rugby football (rugby union and rugby league) a hat-trick is when a player scores three or more tries in a game. In rugby union, a related concept is that of a &quot;full house&quot; (scoring a try, conversion, penalty goal, and drop goal) in a single game. When a player scores two tries, this is often referred to as a brace. As with association football, it is common to award the match ball to a player who scores a hat-trick.

Ken Irvine and Frank Burge both scored 16 hat-tricks in Australian first grade rugby league.

Shaun Johnson scored a hat-trick in under 6 minutes against the Canberra Raiders in 2013, and in the 2017 Rugby League World Cup, Valentine Holmes scored a double hat-trick (6 tries) against Fiji.

=== Handball ===
In handball, if a player scores thrice in a game, a hat-trick is made.

===Hockey===

In field hockey and ice hockey, a hat trick occurs when a player scores three goals in a single game. A hat trick in ice hockey, as it is known in its current form, culminates with fans throwing hats onto the ice from the stands. The tradition is said to have begun among fans in the National Hockey League around the 1950s,
with several conflicting legends from the Canadian cities of Toronto, Montreal, and Guelph of various hatmakers offering a free hat to players who scored a hat trick.

In 1946, the Biltmore Hat Company in Guelph sponsored the Guelph Biltmore Mad Hatters, a junior affiliate team of the NHL&#x27;s New York Rangers. When a Mad Hatters player recorded a Hat Trick, hats were thrown on the ice and the player received a new Biltmore fedora after the game to honor his accomplishment.

Wayne Gretzky holds the NHL record for the most hat tricks in a career with 50. Harry Hyland scored the league&#x27;s first hat trick, in the league&#x27;s first game on 18 December 1917, in which Hyland&#x27;s Montreal Wanderers defeated the Toronto Arenas 10–9.

====Variations====
In ice hockey, a natural hat trick occurs when a player scores three consecutive goals, uninterrupted by any other player scoring for either team. The NHL record for the fastest natural hat trick is 21 seconds, set by Bill Mosienko in 1952 for the Chicago Blackhawks.

A Gordie Howe hat trick is a tongue-in-cheek play on the feat. It is achieved by scoring a goal, getting an assist, and getting into a fight, all in the same game. Namesake Gordie Howe himself only recorded two in his NHL career. Rick Tocchet accomplished the feat 18 times in his career, the most in NHL history.

In October 1995, Florida Panthers captain Scott Mellanby scored a rat trick, the term coined by teammate John Vanbiesbrouck. Prior to the game, Mellanby killed a rat in the Panthers&#x27; locker room with his hockey stick, and proceeded to score a pair of goals later that night. When Mellanby scored a hat trick in a later game, some Florida fans threw plastic rats onto the ice, a tradition that continued for all Panthers&#x27; goals throughout the 1996 playoffs. Due to the resulting game delays caused by the necessary clean-up of the plastic rats, the league eventually banned the activity and modified Rule 63 to impose a minor penalty against the home team for a violation. The more traditional practice of fans throwing hats onto the ice following genuine hat tricks remains exempt from this penalty.

===Lacrosse===
In lacrosse, like other sports with goal scoring, hat tricks occur when a player scores three goals in one game. Fans rarely throw hats onto the playing surface to acknowledge them due to their frequent occurrences in a game. When a player scores six goals in one game, it is referred to as a sock trick.

===Motor racing===
In motor racing, three successive race wins, winning the same event three times in a row, or securing pole position, fastest lap and race victory in one event may all be referred to as a hat-trick.

===Water polo===
In water polo, if a player scores thrice in a game, a hat-trick is scored.

<doc id="411551" wikidata="Q189582" url="?curid=411551" title="Narmer">
<text>Narmer (, may mean &quot;painful catfish&quot;, &quot;stinging catfish&quot;, &quot;harsh catfish&quot;, or &quot;fierce catfish&quot;; ) was an ancient Egyptian king of the Early Dynastic Period, whose reign began at a date estimated to fall in the range 3173–2987 BC. He was the successor to the Protodynastic king Ka. Many scholars consider him the unifier of Egypt and founder of the First Dynasty, and in turn the first king of a unified Egypt. He also had a prominently noticeable presence in Canaan, compared to his predecessors and successors. Neithhotep is thought to be his queen consort or his daughter.

A majority of Egyptologists believe that Narmer was the same person as Menes.

==Historical identity==
Although highly interrelated, the questions of &quot;who was Menes?&quot; and &quot;who unified Egypt?&quot; are actually two separate issues. Narmer is often credited with the unification of Egypt by means of the conquest of Lower Egypt by Upper Egypt. Menes is traditionally considered the first king/pharaoh of Ancient Egypt, and is identified by the majority of Egyptologists as the same person as Narmer – although a vigorous debate also proposes identification with Hor-Aha, Narmer&#x27;s successor, as a primary alternative.

The issue is confusing because &quot;Narmer&quot; is a Horus name while &quot;Menes&quot; is a Sedge and Bee name (personal or birth name). All of the King Lists which began to appear in the New Kingdom era list the personal names of the kings, and almost all begin with Menes, or begin with divine and/or semi-divine rulers, with Menes as the first &quot;human king&quot;. The difficulty is aligning the contemporary archaeological evidence which lists Horus names with the king lists that list personal names.
Two documents have been put forward as proof either that Narmer was Menes or alternatively Hor-Aha was Menes. The first is the &quot;Naqada Label&quot; found at the site of Naqada, in the tomb of Queen Neithhotep, often assumed to have been the mother of Horus Aha. The label shows a serekh of Hor-Aha next to an enclosure inside of which are symbols that have been interpreted by some scholars as the name &quot;Menes&quot;. The second is the seal impression from Abydos that alternates between a &quot;serekh&quot; of Narmer and the chessboard symbol, &quot;mn&quot;, which is interpreted as an abbreviation of Menes. Arguments have been made with regard to each of these documents in favour of Narmer or Hor-Aha being Menes, but in neither case is the argument conclusive.
The second document, the seal impression from Abydos, shows the serekh of Narmer alternating with the gameboard sign (&quot;&quot;), together with its phonetic complement, the &quot;n&quot; sign, which is always shown when the full name of Menes is written, again representing the name &quot;Menes&quot;. At first glance, this would seem to be strong evidence that Narmer was Menes. However, based on an analysis of other early First Dynasty seal impressions, which contain the name of one or more princes, the seal impression has been interpreted by other scholars as showing the name of a prince of Narmer named Menes, hence Menes was Narmer&#x27;s successor, Hor-Aha, and thus Hor-Aha was Menes. This was refuted by ; but opinions still vary, and the seal impression cannot be said to definitively support either theory.


Two necropolis sealings, found in 1985 and 1991 in Abydos (Umm el-Qa&#x27;ab), in or near the tombs of Den(called the Den seal impressions) and Qa&#x27;a(called the Qa&#x27;a sealing),() show Narmer as the first king on each list, followed by Hor-Aha. The Qa&#x27;a sealing lists all eight of the kings of what scholars now call the First Dynasty in the correct order, starting with Narmer. These necropolis sealings are strong evidence that Narmer was the first king of the First Dynasty, hence the same person as Menes.

==Name==
The complete spelling of Narmer&#x27;s name consists of the hieroglyphs for a catfish (&quot;&quot;) and a chisel (&quot;&quot;), hence the reading &quot;Narmer&quot; (using the rebus principle). This word is sometimes translated as &quot;raging catfish&quot;. However, there is no consensus on this reading. Other translations of the adjective before &quot;catfish&quot; include &quot;angry&quot;, &quot;fighting&quot;, &quot;fierce&quot;, &quot;painful&quot;, &quot;furious&quot;, &quot;bad&quot;, &quot;evil&quot;, &quot;biting&quot;, &quot;menacing&quot;, and &quot;stinging&quot;. Some scholars have taken entirely different approaches to reading the name that do not include &quot;catfish&quot; in the name at all, but these approaches have not been generally accepted.

Rather than incorporating both hieroglyphs, Narmer&#x27;s name is often shown in an abbreviated form with just the catfish symbol, sometimes stylized, even, in some cases, represented by just a horizontal line. This simplified spelling appears to be related to the formality of the context. In every case that a &quot;serekh&quot; is shown on a work of stone or an official seal impression, it has both symbols. But, in most cases, where the name is shown on a piece of pottery or a rock inscription, just the catfish, or a simplified version of it appears.

Two alternative spellings of Narmer&#x27;s name have also been found. On a mud sealing from Tarkhan, the symbol for the &quot;&quot;-bird (Gardiner sign &quot;G47&quot; &quot;duckling&quot;) has been added to the two symbols for &quot;Narmer&quot; within the serekh. This has been interpreted as meaning &quot;Narmer the masculine&quot;; however, according to Ilona Regulski, &quot;The third sign (the [&quot;ṯꜣj&quot;]-bird) is not an integral part of the royal name since it occurs so infrequently.&quot; Godron suggested that the extra sign is not part of the name, but was put inside the serekh for compositional convenience.

In addition, two necropolis seals from Abydos show the name in a unique way: While the chisel is shown conventionally where the catfish would be expected, there is a symbol that has been interpreted by several scholars as an animal skin. According to Dreyer, it is probably a catfish with a bull&#x27;s tail, similar to the image of Narmer on the Narmer Palette in which he is shown wearing a bull&#x27;s tail as a symbol of power.

==Reign==
The date commonly given for the beginning of Narmer&#x27;s reign is c. 3100 BC. Other mainstream estimates, using both the historical method and radiocarbon dating, are in the range c. 3173–2987 BC.

===Unification of Upper and Lower Egypt===
The famous Narmer Palette, discovered by James E. Quibell in the 1897–1898 season at Hierakonpolis, shows Narmer wearing the crown of Upper Egypt on one side of the palette, and the crown of Lower Egypt on the other side, giving rise to the theory that Narmer unified the two lands. Since its discovery, however, it has been debated whether the Narmer Palette represents an actual historic event or is purely symbolic. Of course, the Narmer Palette could represent an actual historical event while at the same time having a symbolic significance.

In 1993, Günter Dreyer discovered a &quot;year label&quot; of Narmer at Abydos, depicting the same event that is depicted on the Narmer Palette. In the First Dynasty, years were identified by the name of the king and an important event that occurred in that year. A &quot;year label&quot; was typically attached to a container of goods and included the name of the king, a description or representation of the event that identified the year, and a description of the attached goods. This year label shows that the Narmer Palette depicts an actual historical event. Support for this conclusion (in addition to Dreyer) includes Wilkinson and Davies &amp; Friedman. Although this interpretation of the year label is the dominant opinion among Egyptologists, there are exceptions including Baines and Wengrow.

Archaeological evidence suggests that Egypt was at least partially unified during the reigns of Ka and Iry-Hor (Narmer&#x27;s immediate predecessors), and perhaps as early as Scorpion I. Tax collection is probably documented for Ka and Iry-Hor. The evidence for a role for Scorpion I in Lower Egypt comes from his tomb Uj in Abydos (Upper Egypt), where labels were found identifying goods from Lower Egypt. These are not tax documents, however, so they are probably indications of trade rather than subjugation. There is a substantial difference in the quantity and distribution of inscriptions with the names of those earlier kings in Lower Egypt and Canaan (which was reached through Lower Egypt), compared to the inscriptions of Narmer. Ka&#x27;s inscriptions have been found in three sites in Lower Egypt and one in Canaan. Iry-Hor inscriptions have also been found in two sites in Lower Egypt and one in Canaan. This must be compared to Narmer, whose &quot;serekhs&quot; have been found in ten sites in Lower Egypt and nine sites in Canaan (see discussion in &quot;Tomb and Artefacts&quot; section). This demonstrates a qualitative difference between Narmer&#x27;s role in Lower Egypt compared to his two immediate predecessors. There is no evidence in Lower Egypt of any Upper Egyptian king&#x27;s presence before Iry-Hor. The archaeological evidence suggest that the unification began before Narmer, but was completed by him through the conquest of a polity in the north-west Delta as depicted on the Narmer Palette.

The importance that Narmer attached to his &quot;unification&quot; of Egypt is shown by the fact that it is commemorated not only on the Narmer Palette, but on a cylinder seal, the Narmer Year Label, and the Narmer Boxes; and the consequences of the event are commemorated on the Narmer Macehead. The importance of the unification to ancient Egyptians is shown by the fact that Narmer is shown as the first king on the two necropolis seals, and under the name Menes, the first king in the later King Lists. Although there is archaeological evidence of a few kings before Narmer, none of them are mentioned in any of those sources. It can be accurately said that from the point of view of Ancient Egyptians, history began with Narmer and the unification of Egypt, and that everything before him was relegated to the realm of myth.

===Peak of Egyptian presence in Canaan===
According to (quoted in Eusebius (Fr. 7(a))), &quot;Menes made a foreign expedition and won renown.&quot; If this is correct (and assuming it refers to Narmer), it was undoubtedly to the land of Canaan where Narmer&#x27;s &quot;serekh&quot; has been identified at nine different sites. An Egyptian presence in Canaan predates Narmer, but after about 200 years of active presence in Canaan, Egyptian presence peaked during Narmer&#x27;s reign and quickly declined afterwards. The relationship between Egypt and Canaan &quot;began around the end of the fifth millennium and apparently came to an end sometime during the Second Dynasty when it ceased altogether.&quot; It peaked during Dynasty 0 through the reign of Narmer. Dating to this period are 33 Egyptian &quot;serekhs&quot; found in Canaan, among which 20 have been attributed to Narmer. Prior to Narmer, only one &quot;serekh&quot; of Ka and one inscription with Iry-Hor&#x27;s name have been found in Canaan. The &quot;serekhs&quot; earlier than Iry-Hor are either generic &quot;serekhs&quot; that do not refer to a specific king, or are for kings not attested in Abydos. Indicative of the decline of Egyptian presence in the region after Narmer, only one &quot;serekh&quot; attributed to his successor, Hor-Aha, has been found in Canaan. Even this one example is questionable, Wilkinson does not believe there are any &quot;serekhs&quot; of Hor-Aha outside Egypt and very few &quot;serekhs&quot; of kings for the rest of the first two dynasties have been found in Canaan.

The Egyptian presence in Canaan is best demonstrated by the presence of pottery made from Egyptian Nile clay and found in Canaan, as well as pottery made from local clay, but in the Egyptian style. The latter suggests the existence of Egyptian colonies rather than just trade.

The nature of Egypt&#x27;s role in Canaan has been vigorously debated, between scholars who suggest a military invasion and others proposing that only trade and colonization were involved. Although the latter has gained predominance, the presence of fortifications at Tell es-Sakan dating to Dynasty 0 through early Dynasty 1 period, and built almost entirely using an Egyptian style of construction, demonstrate that there must have also been some kind of Egyptian military presence.

Regardless of the nature of Egypt&#x27;s presence in Canaan, control of trade to (and through) Canaan was important to Ancient Egypt. Narmer probably did not establish Egypt&#x27;s initial influence in Canaan by a military invasion, but a military campaign by Narmer to re-assert Egyptian authority, or to increase its sphere of influence in the region, is certainly plausible. In addition to the quote by Manetho, and the large number of Narmer &quot;serekhs&quot; found in Canaan, a recent reconstruction of a box of Narmer&#x27;s by Dreyer may have commemorated a military campaign in Canaan. It may also represent just the presentation of tribute to Narmer by Canaanites.

===Neithhotep===
Narmer and Hor-Aha&#x27;s names were both found in what is believed to be Neithhotep&#x27;s tomb, which led Egyptologists to conclude that she was Narmer&#x27;s queen and mother of Hor-Aha. Neithhotep&#x27;s name means &quot;Neith is satisfied&quot;. This suggests that she was a princess of Lower Egypt (based on the fact that Neith is the patron goddess of Sais in the Western Delta, exactly the area Narmer conquered to complete the unification of Egypt), and that this was a marriage to consolidate the two regions of Egypt. The fact that her tomb is in Naqada, in Upper Egypt, has led some to the conclusion that she was a descendant of the predynastic rulers of Naqada who ruled prior to its incorporation into a united Upper Egypt. It has also been suggested that the Narmer Macehead commemorates this wedding. However, the discovery in 2012 of rock inscriptions in Sinai by Pierre Tallet raise questions about whether she was really Narmer&#x27;s wife. Neithhotep is probably the earliest non-mythical woman in history whose name is known to us today.

==Tomb and artifacts==
===Tomb===
Narmer&#x27;s tomb in Umm el-Qa&#x27;ab near Abydos in Upper Egypt consists of two joined chambers (B17 and B18), lined in mud brick. Although both Émile Amélineau and Petrie excavated tombs B17 and B18, it was only in 1964 that Kaiser identified them as being Narmer&#x27;s. Narmer&#x27;s tomb is located next to the tombs of Ka, who likely ruled Upper Egypt just before Narmer, and Hor-Aha, who was his immediate successor.

As the tomb dates back more than 5,000 years, and has been pillaged, repeatedly, from antiquity to modern times, it is amazing that anything useful could be discovered in it. Because of the repeated disturbances in Umm el-Qa&#x27;ab, many articles of Narmer&#x27;s were found in other graves, and objects of other kings were recovered in Narmer&#x27;s grave. However, Flinders Petrie during the period 1899–1903, and, starting in the 1970s, the German Archaeological Institute (DAI) have made discoveries of the greatest importance to the history of Early Egypt by their re-excavation of the tombs of Umm el-Qa&#x27;ab.

Despite the chaotic condition of the cemetery, inscriptions on both wood and bone, seal impressions, as well as dozens of flint arrowheads were found. (Petrie says with dismay that &quot;hundreds&quot; of arrowheads were discovered by &quot;the French&quot;, presumably Amélineau. What happened to them is not clear, but none ended up in the Cairo Museum.) Flint knives and a fragment of an ebony chair leg were also discovered in Narmer&#x27;s tomb, all of which might be part of the original funerary assemblage. The flint knives and fragment of a chair leg were not included in any of Petrie&#x27;s publications, but are now at the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology (University College London), registration numbers &quot;UC35679, UC52786&quot;, and &quot;UC35682&quot;. According to Dreyer, these arrowheads are probably from the tomb of Djer, where similar arrowheads were found.

It is likely that all of the kings of Ancient Egypt buried in Umm el-Qa&#x27;ab had funerary enclosures in Abydos&#x27; northern cemetery, near the cultivation line. These were characterized by large mud brick walls that enclosed space in which funerary ceremonies are believed to have taken place. Eight enclosures have been excavated, two of which have not been definitely identified. While it has yet to be confirmed, one of these unidentified funerary enclosures may have belonged to Narmer.

===Artifacts===

Narmer is well attested throughout Egypt, southern Canaan and Sinai: altogether 98 inscriptions at 26 sites. At Abydos and Hierakonpolis Narmer&#x27;s name appears both within a &quot;serekh&quot; and without reference to a &quot;serekh&quot;. At every other site except Coptos, Narmer&#x27;s name appears in a &quot;serekh&quot;. In Egypt, his name has been found at 17 sites: 
* 4 in Upper Egypt: Hierakonpolis, Naqada, Abydos, and Coptos
* 10 in Lower Egypt: Tarkhan, Helwan, Zawyet el&#x27;Aryan, Tell Ibrahim Awad, Ezbet el-Tell, Minshat Abu Omar, Saqqara, Buto, Tell el-Farkha, and Kafr Hassan Dawood
* 1 in the Eastern Desert: Wadi el-Qaash
* 2 in the Western Desert: Kharga Oasis and Gebel Tjauti

During Narmer&#x27;s reign, Egypt had an active economic presence in southern Canaan. Pottery sherds have been discovered at several sites, both from pots made in Egypt and imported to Canaan and others made in the Egyptian style out of local materials. Twenty &quot;serekhs&quot; have been found in Canaan that may belong to Narmer, but seven of those are uncertain or controversial. These &quot;serekhs&quot; came from eight different sites: Tel Arad, En Besor (Ein HaBesor), Tell es-Sakan, Nahal Tillah (Halif Terrace), Tel Erani (Tel Gat), Small Tel Malhata, Tel Ma&#x27;ahaz, and Tel Lod,

Narmer&#x27;s &quot;serekh&quot;, along with those of other Predynastic and Early Dynastic kings, has been found at the Wadi &#x27;Ameyra in the southern Sinai, where inscriptions commemorate Egyptian mining expeditions to the area.

===Nag el-Hamdulab===
First recorded at the end of the 19th century, an important series of rock carvings at Nag el-Hamdulab near Aswan was rediscovered in 2009, and its importance only realized then. Among the many inscriptions, tableau 7a shows a man wearing a headdress similar to the White Crown of Upper Egypt and carrying a scepter. He is followed by a man with a fan. He is then preceded by two men with standards, and accompanied by a dog. Apart from the dog motif, this scene is similar to scenes on the Scorpion Macehead and the recto of the Narmer Palette. The man, equipped with pharaonic regalia (the crown and scepter), can clearly be identified as a king. Although no name appears in the tableau, Darnell attributes it to Narmer, based on the iconography, and suggests that it might represent an actual visit to the region by Narmer for a &quot;Following of Horus&quot; ritual. In an interview in 2012, Gatto also describes the king in the inscription as Narmer. However, Hendricks (2016) places the scene slightly before Narmer, based, in part on the uncharacteristic absence of Narmer&#x27;s royal name in the inscription.

<doc id="411556" wikidata="Q2485390" url="?curid=411556" title="Missouri Route 141">
<text>Route 141, also known as Woods Mill Road in parts of St. Louis County, is a state highway located in the western St. Louis metropolitan area. Its northern terminus is at Route 370 in Bridgeton; its southern terminus is at U.S. Route 61/U.S. Route 67 in Arnold, in Jefferson County. The northern stretches of the highway are often referred to as the Maryland Heights Expressway or Earth City Expressway.

==Route description==
For the majority of its duration, Route 141 is a divided highway with four to eight lanes.

===Jefferson County===

In Jefferson County, Route 141 is a four-lane highway. It has a southern terminus at U.S. Route 61/U.S. Route 67 in Arnold. At this point, it is an at-grade route with business driveways and traffic lights. It continues northwest and has a hybrid SPUI and diamond interchange with I-55. After the interchange, it becomes a rural highway with two lanes on each side of a wide grass median. While nearing the Meramec River, the highway has an at-grade intersection with Old Missouri State Road. After this intersection, the grassy median ends and the road is instead separated by a Jersey barrier. The route then has a diamond interchange with the Route 21 freeway. After this interchange, Route 141 again sports a wide grassy median. It continues north and crosses the county line into Fenton in St. Louis County.

===St. Louis County===
Route 141 enters St. Louis County in Fenton. It has an interchange with Route 30 and widens into a six- to eight-lane divided highway. Heading north, Route 141 passes a plaza to the left that includes various restaurants. After the plaza, Route 141 heads into a suburban area and has at-grade interchanges with several collector roads. The highway heads northeast and has an interchange with Interstate 44 in Valley Park. Shortly after this interchange, Route 141 crosses the Meramec River and the Meramec River Greenway and enters Valley Park.

In Valley Park, Route 141 passes over, and then under, a pair of railroad tracks and has several at-grade intersections with local road. Heading north, the highway passes the Valley Park water tower and abruptly turns northwest. The road then enters Twin Oaks and has a SPUI with Big Bend Road. Shortly after the interchange, Route 141 enters Manchester. The road weaves through suburban areas, and after an at-grade intersection with Carmen Road, Route 141 gains outer roads in both directions. The highway then has a SPUI with Missouri Route 100 (Manchester Road) while heading directly north. After this interchange, Route 141 has an at-grade intersection with a plaza containing a Costco and a Walmart Supercenter.

Past the intersection, Route 141 serves as a border between Missouri River Township and Ballwin. The highway continues to mainly serve suburban areas. The road weaves northeast and enters Town and Country. Route 141 then has a hybrid trumpet interchange with Clayton Road and briefly becomes a controlled-access highway. Woods Mill Road serves as an outer road. The freeway ends at a signalized hybrid interchange with Interstate 64/US 40/US 61. Maryville University is located to the east. Route 141 subsequently clips the eastern edge of Chesterfield and passes St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital.

Past this point, Route 141 becomes a controlled-access freeway. It has a SPUI with Ladue Road (Route AB). The highway curves northeastwards, passing Parkway Central High School, which is located to the west of the road. Shortly after passing the school, Route 141 curves back northward and heads through a wooded area. Subsequently, Route 141 as a SPUI interchange with Route 340 (Olive Boulevard). Route 141 becomes elevated after the interchange, crossing over Creve Coeur Creek and several other streams, and passing a neighborhood to the west. Route 141 then crosses Waterworks Road and railroad tracks, entering Maryland Heights. The name of the road changes to Maryland Heights Expressway. Shortly after entering Maryland Heights, Route 141 has a SPUI with Route 364, After that, Route 141 passes Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre, and has an interchange with Interstate 70, and the highway splits between north and southbound and reconnecting at Route 180 (St Charles Rock Road) 

The highway meets its northern terminus after the interchange with Route 370 at Missouri Bottom Road.

==History==
Old Highway 141 was a two-lane road built in the 1930s. The idea of an newer, divided highway carrying the Route 141 designation dates to the 1970s, when regional highway planners adopted the idea of an &quot;outer belt&quot; west of I-270. In 1976, Frank Kriz, then the district state highway engineer, called 141 an &quot;old ridge-runner.&quot; The highways had traffic jams due to suburban growth. That same year, construction began for a new, four-lane Highway 141 in Jefferson County. Subsequent progress included a new bridge over the Meramec River at Valley Park in 1986 and a new interchange at Manchester Road in 1999. The section of Route 141 between Interstate 64 and the St. Louis County/Jefferson County line was upgraded to six lanes in a project completed in 2003.

===Extension===
In August 2012, a six-lane realignment opened between Ladue Road and Page Avenue (Route 364), with interchanges at Ladue, Olive (Route 340), and Page. The section between Page and Olive (tentatively titled the Page-Olive Connector), which was constructed by St. Louis County has been turned over to the Missouri Department of Transportation and designated as Route 141. Maryland Heights Expressway (the section from Page north to I-70) and Earth City Expressway (the section from I-70 north to its terminus at Route 370) have also been designated as 141. As such, Route 141 now runs from US 61/67 in Arnold to Route 370 in Bridgeton.
The Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) in cooperation with the St. Louis County Department of Highways and Traffic (DHT) expanded Route 141. 1 between just south of Ladue Road (Route AB) to Olive Boulevard (Route 340). DHT extended Route 141 from Olive Boulevard to the Page Avenue Extension (Route 364) at the Maryland Heights Expressway which links to the Earth City Expressway which continues north to Route 370 where it then turns into Missouri Bottom Road via Aubuchon Road. SPUIs were constructed at Ladue Road and Olive Blvd. There were some construction constraints with the part of the project between Olive and Page. DHT held studies of the environment to decide how to maneuver construction without disturbing some of the native wetlands in the corridor. During heavy rain, the current intersection at Creve Coeur Mill Road and Olive has the potential to flood, and most of the area along Creve Coeur Mill Road are either wetlands or farmland that lies in a flood plain.

St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley had called the project &quot;one of St. Louis County&#x27;s largest and most important infrastructure improvements this decade.&quot; The economic impact of the construction project was not nearly as massive as the upgrading and realignment project on Interstate 64/Highway 40. This construction project was estimated to have a $20 billion economic impact and create over 170,000 jobs during the 2010 decade.

<doc id="411557" wikidata="Q617924" url="?curid=411557" title="Battle of Olpae">
<text>The Battle of Olpae took place during the Peloponnesian War in 426 BC, between armies led by Athens and Sparta.

In 426, 3,000 hoplites from Ambracia invaded Amphilochian Argos in Acarnania on a gulf of the Ionian Sea and occupied the fort of Olpae. The Acarnanians asked for help from both the Athenian general Demosthenes, and the 20 Athenian ships located nearby under the command of Aristotle and Hierophon. The Ambraciots asked for help from Eurylochus of Sparta, who managed to march his army past the Acarnanians without being observed. After this, Demosthenes arrived in the gulf below Olpae with his ships, 200 hoplites, and 60 archers. He joined with the Acarnanian army and set up camp in a ravine opposite Eurylochus, where both sides made preparations for five days. As the Ambraciot and Peloponnesian army was larger, Demosthenes set up an ambush with 400 hoplites from Acarnania, to be used when the battle began. 

Demosthenes formed the right wing of the Athenian-led army with Athenian and Messenian troops, with the centre and left wing formed by the Acarnanians and Amphilochians. Eurylochus formed the left wing of his army, directly facing Demosthenes, with the Ambraciots and Mantineans forming the rest of the line. When the battle began, Eurylochus quickly outflanked Demosthenes and was about to surround him when the Acarnanians began their ambush, causing panic among the other troops when Eurylochus was killed. The Ambraciots defeated the left wing of the Acarnanians and Amphilochians, chasing them back to Argos, but they were themselves defeated by the rest of the Acarnanians when they returned. Demosthenes lost about 300 men, but emerged victorious when the battle was completed later that night.

The next day, Menedaius, who had taken command when Eurylochus was killed, attempted to arrange a truce with Demosthenes. Demosthenes would only allow the leaders of the army to escape. This was psychological warfare by Demosthenes &quot;...to discredit the Lacedaemonians and Peloponnesians with the Hellenes in those parts, as traitors and self-seekers&quot;. However, some of the Ambraciots attempted to flee with Menedaius and the other commanders. The Acarnanians chased them, allowed Menedaius to escape as agreed, and killed about 200 Ambraciots.

Meanwhile, Demosthenes learned that a second army from Ambracia was marching towards Olpae. These Ambraciots set up camp on the road to the fort at Idomene, having no knowledge of the defeat of the previous day. Demosthenes surprised them there at night, pretending to be the other Ambraciot army, and killed most of them; the rest fled to the hills or into the sea where they were captured by the 20 Athenian ships. Overall, the Ambraciots lost about 1,000 men over the two days. 

Although Demosthenes could have easily taken Ambracia, he did not, because his allies feared a strong Athens in that region and so the Acarnanians and Ambraciots signed a 100-year peace treaty with them.

<text>The South Dakota Department of Corrections is the agency that operates state prisons in the US state of South Dakota. It has its headquarters in Pierre.

==Adult prisons==
* Mike Durfee State Prison in Springfield
* South Dakota State Penitentiary and its Jameson Annex, both in Sioux Falls
* South Dakota Women&#x27;s Prison in Pierre (inmate capacity 452)
* Rapid City Minimum Center in Rapid City
* Yankton Minimum Center in Yankton

==Juvenile corrections==
The South Dakota corrections system includes the Juvenile Corrections System, its network of juvenile facilities.

The State Treatment and Rehabilitation Academy (STAR Academy) is located in unincorporated Custer County, south of Custer on U.S. Highway 385. STAR Evergreen High School serves as the middle and high school for delinquent youth. The STAR campus includes several units. The STAR Admissions Unit processes new arrivals. The Youth Challenge Center and the Patrick H. Brady Academy serve young men. The QUEST and Excel programs serve young women.

The West Farm in unincorporated Minnehaha County, near Sioux Falls, serves as the juvenile transitional care facility for boys who are about to go back into their communities. 
STAR Academy and Patrick H Brady Academy closed in April 2016. All juveniles are housed in private placements supervised by Juvenile Community Corrections staff.

==Prison gang activity==
Over the ten years leading to 2010, prison staff identified approximately 150 different gangs in South Dakota&#x27;s state prisons. Of those, eight are currently active at the South Dakota State Penitentiary in Sioux Falls. Most have racial allegiances, like the Gangster Disciples, an African American street gang; and the Sureños, a Hispanic street gang. Warden Doug Weber told KSFY-TV that two gangs actually formed at the South Dakota State Penitentiary: the Family Brotherhood is an Aryan gang and the Red Brotherhood is a Native American gang.

<doc id="411562" wikidata="Q1758090" url="?curid=411562" title="Xmas">
<text>Xmas (also X-mas) is a common abbreviation of the word &quot;Christmas&quot;. It is sometimes pronounced , but &quot;Xmas&quot;, and variants such as &quot;Xtemass&quot;, originated as handwriting abbreviations for the typical pronunciation . The &#x27;X&#x27; comes from the Greek letter , which is the first letter of the Greek word (), which became &quot;Christ&quot; in English.
The suffix &quot;-mas&quot; is from the Latin-derived Old English word for Mass.

There is a common misconception that the word &quot;Xmas&quot; stems from a secularizing tendency to de-emphasize the religious tradition of Christmas, by taking the &#x27;Christ&#x27; out of &quot;Christmas&quot;. Nevertheless, the term&#x27;s usage dates back to the 16th century, and corresponds to Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran and Anglican liturgical use of various forms of chi-rho monogram. In English, &quot;X&quot; was first used as a scribal abbreviation for &quot;Christ&quot; in 1100; &quot;X&#x27;temmas&quot; is attested in 1551, and &quot;Xmas&quot; in 1721.

==Style guides and etiquette==
The term &quot;Xmas&quot; is deprecated by some modern style guides, including those at &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and the BBC. Millicent Fenwick, in the 1948 &quot;Vogue&#x27;s Book of Etiquette&quot;, states that &quot;&#x27;Xmas&#x27; should never be used&quot; in greeting cards. &quot;The Cambridge Guide to Australian English Usage&quot; states that the spelling should be considered informal and restricted to contexts where concision is valued, such as headlines and greeting cards. &quot;The Christian Writer&#x27;s Manual of Style&quot;, while acknowledging the ancient and respectful use of &quot;Xmas&quot; in the past, states that the spelling should never be used in formal writing.

==History==

===Use in English===

Early use of &quot;Xmas&quot; includes Bernard Ward&#x27;s &quot;History of St. Edmund&#x27;s college, Old Hall&quot; (originally published ). An earlier version, &quot;X&#x27;temmas&quot;, dates to 1551. Around 1100 the term was written as in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;. &quot;Xmas&quot; is found in a letter from George Woodward in 1753. Lord Byron used the term in 1811, as did Samuel Coleridge (1801) and Lewis Carroll (1864). In the United States, the fifth American edition of William Perry&#x27;s &quot;Royal Standard English Dictionary&quot;, published in Boston in 1800, included in its list of &quot;Explanations of Common Abbreviations, or Contraction of Words&quot; the entry: &quot;Xmas. Christmas.&quot; Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. used the term in a letter dated 1923.

Since at least the late 19th century, &quot;Xmas&quot; has been in use in various other English-language nations. Quotations with the word can be found in texts first written in Canada, and the word has been used in Australia, and in the Caribbean. &quot;Merriam-Webster&#x27;s Dictionary of English Usage&quot; stated that modern use of the term is largely limited to advertisements, headlines and banners, where its conciseness is valued. The association with commerce &quot;has done nothing for its reputation&quot;, according to the dictionary.

In the United Kingdom, the former Church of England Bishop of Blackburn, Alan Chesters, recommended to his clergy that they avoid the spelling. In the United States, in 1977 New Hampshire Governor Meldrim Thomson sent out a press release saying that he wanted journalists to keep the &quot;Christ&quot; in Christmas, and not call it Xmas—which he called a &quot;pagan&quot; spelling of &#x27;Christmas&#x27;.

===Use of &quot;X&quot; for &#x27;Christ&#x27;===
The abbreviation of Christmas as &quot;Xmas&quot; is a source of disagreement among Christians who observe the holiday.

The December 1957 &quot;News and Views&quot; published by the Church League of America, a conservative organization co-founded in 1937 by George Washington Robnett, attacked the use of Xmas in an article titled &quot;X=The Unknown Quantity&quot;. The claims were picked up later by Gerald L. K. Smith, who in December 1966 claimed that Xmas was a &quot;blasphemous omission of the name of Christ&quot; and that &quot;&#x27;X&#x27; is referred to as being symbolical of the unknown quantity&quot;. Smith further argued that the Jewish people had introduced Santa Claus to suppress New Testament accounts of Jesus, and that the United Nations, at the behest of &quot;world Jewry&quot;, had &quot;outlawed the name of Christ&quot;. There is, however, a well documented history of use of &quot;Χ&quot; (actually the Greek letter ) as an abbreviation for &quot;Christ&quot; and possibly also a symbol of the cross. The abbreviation appears on many Orthodox Christian religious icons.

Dennis Bratcher, writing for Christian website &quot;The Voice&quot;, states &quot;there are always those who loudly decry the use of the abbreviation &#x27;Xmas&#x27; as some kind of blasphemy against Christ and Christianity&quot;. Among them are evangelist Franklin Graham and former CNN contributor Roland S. Martin. Graham stated in an interview:

Roland Martin likewise relates the use of &quot;Xmas&quot; to his growing concerns of increasing commercialization and secularization of one of Christianity&#x27;s highest holy days. Bratcher posits that those who dislike abbreviating the word are unfamiliar with a long history of Christians using X in place of &quot;Christ&quot; for various purposes.

The word &quot;Christ&quot; and its compounds, including &quot;Christmas&quot;, have been abbreviated in English for at least the past 1,000 years, long before the modern &quot;Xmas&quot; was commonly used. &quot;Christ&quot; was often written as &#x27;Xρ&#x27; or &#x27;Xt&#x27;; there are references in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; as far back as 1021. This &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;P&#x27; arose as the uppercase forms of the Greek letters (Ch) and (R) used in ancient abbreviations for (Greek for &quot;Christ&quot;). The Chi-Rho, an amalgamation of the two Greek letters rendered as &#x27;☧&#x27; (Unicode character ) is a symbol often used to represent Christ in Catholic, Protestant, and Orthodox Christian Churches.

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (&quot;OED&quot;) and the &quot;OED Supplement&quot; have cited usages of &quot;X-&quot; or &quot;Xp-&quot; for &#x27;Christ-&#x27; as early as 1485. The terms &quot;Xtian&quot; and less commonly &quot;Xpian&quot; have also been used for &#x27;Christian&#x27;. The &quot;OED&quot; further cites usage of &quot;Xtianity&quot; for &#x27;Christianity&#x27; from 1634. According to &quot;Merriam-Webster&#x27;s Dictionary of English Usage&quot;, most of the evidence for these words comes from &quot;educated Englishmen who knew their Greek&quot;.

In ancient Christian art, and are abbreviations for Christ&#x27;s name. In many manuscripts of the &quot;New Testament&quot; and icons, &#x27;Χ&#x27; is an abbreviation for , as is XC (the first and last letters in Greek, using the lunate sigma); compare IC for Jesus in Greek.

====Other uses of &quot;X(t)&quot; for &#x27;Chris(t)-&#x27;====
Other proper names containing the name &#x27;Christ&#x27; besides those mentioned above are sometimes abbreviated similarly, either as &quot;X&quot; or &quot;Xt&quot;, both of which have been used historically, e.g., &quot;Xtopher&quot; or &quot;Xopher&quot; for &#x27;Christopher&#x27;, or &quot;Xtina&quot; or &quot;Xina&quot; for the name &#x27;Christina&#x27;.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, &quot;Xene&quot; and &quot;Exene&quot; were common spellings for the given name &#x27;Christine&#x27;. The American singer Christina Aguilera has sometimes gone by the name &quot;Xtina&quot;. Similarly, Exene Cervenka has been a noted American singer-songwriter since 1977.

This usage of &#x27;X&#x27; to spell the syllable &quot;kris&quot; (rather than the sounds &quot;ks&quot;) has extended to &quot;xtal&quot; for &#x27;crystal&#x27;, and on florists&#x27; signs to &quot;xant&quot; for &#x27;chrysanthemum&#x27;, even though these words are not etymologically related to &quot;Christ&quot;: &quot;crystal&quot; comes from a Greek word meaning &#x27;ice&#x27; (and not even using the letter ), and &quot;chrysanthemum&quot; comes from Greek words meaning &#x27;golden flower&#x27;, while &quot;Christ&quot; comes from a Greek word meaning &#x27;anointed&#x27;.

<text>New Lanark is a village on the River Clyde, approximately from Lanark, in Lanarkshire, and some southeast of Glasgow, Scotland. It was founded in 1785 and opened in 1786 by David Dale, who built cotton mills and housing for the mill workers. Dale built the mills there in a brief partnership with the English inventor and entrepreneur Richard Arkwright to take advantage of the water power provided by the only waterfalls on the River Clyde. Under the ownership of a partnership that included Dale&#x27;s son-in-law, Robert Owen, a Welsh utopian socialist and philanthropist, New Lanark became a successful business and an early example of a planned settlement and so an important milestone in the historical development of urban planning.

The New Lanark mills operated until 1968. After a period of decline, the New Lanark Conservation Trust (NLCT) was founded in 1974 (now known as the New Lanark Trust (NLT)) to prevent demolition of the village. By 2006 most of the buildings have been restored and the village has become a major tourist attraction. It is one of six UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Scotland and an Anchor Point of ERIH – the European Route of Industrial Heritage.

== History ==
The New Lanark cotton mills were founded in 1786 by David Dale in a brief partnership with Richard Arkwright. Dale was one of the self-made &quot;Burgher Gentry&quot; of Glasgow who, like most of this gentry, had a summer retreat, an estate at Rosebank, Cambuslang, not far from the Falls of Clyde, which have been painted by J. M. W. Turner and many other artists. The mills used the recently developed water-powered cotton spinning machinery invented by Richard Arkwright. Dale sold the mills, lands and village in the early 19th century for £60,000, payable over 20 years, to a partnership that included his son-in-law Robert Owen. Owen, who became mill manager in 1800, was an industrialist who carried on his father-in-law&#x27;s philanthropic approach to industrial working and who subsequently became an influential social reformer. New Lanark, with its social and welfare programmes, epitomised his Utopian socialism (&quot;see also Owenism&quot;). The town and mills are important historically through their connection with Owen&#x27;s ideas, but also because of their role in the developing Industrial Revolution in the UK and their place in the history of urban planning.

The New Lanark mills depended upon water power. A dam was constructed on the Clyde above New Lanark and water was drawn off the river to power the mill machinery. The water first travelled through a tunnel, then through an open channel called the lade. It then went to a number of water wheels in each mill building. It was not until 1929 that the last waterwheel was replaced by a water turbine. Water power is still used in New Lanark. A new water turbine has been installed in Mill Number Three to provide electricity for the tourist areas of the village.

In Owen&#x27;s time some 2,500 people lived at New Lanark, many from the poorhouses of Glasgow and Edinburgh. Although not the grimmest of mills by far, Owen found the conditions unsatisfactory and resolved to improve the workers&#x27; lot. He paid particular attention to the needs of the 500 or so children living in the village (one of the tenement blocks is named Nursery Buildings) and working at the mills, and opened the first infants&#x27; school in Britain in 1817, although the previous year he had completed the Institute for the Formation of Character.

The mills thrived commercially, but Owen&#x27;s partners were unhappy at the extra expense incurred by his welfare programmes. Unwilling to allow the mills to revert to the old ways of operating, Owen bought out his partners. In 1813 the Board forced an auction, hoping to obtain the town and mills at a low price but Owen and a new board (including the economist Jeremy Bentham) that was sympathetic to his reforming ideas won out.

New Lanark became celebrated throughout Europe, with many statesmen, reformers and royalty visiting the mills. They were astonished to find a clean, healthy industrial environment with a content, vibrant workforce and a prosperous, viable business venture all rolled into one. Owen&#x27;s philosophy was contrary to contemporary thinking, but he was able to demonstrate that it was not necessary for an industrial enterprise to treat its workers badly to be profitable. Owen was able to show visitors the village&#x27;s excellent housing and amenities, and the accounts showing the profitability of the mills.

As well as the mills&#x27; connections with reform, socialism and welfare, they are also representative of the Industrial Revolution that occurred in Britain in the 18th and 19th centuries and which fundamentally altered the shape of the world. The planning of employment in the mills alongside housing for the workers and services such as a school also makes the settlement iconic in the development of urban planning in the UK.

In 1825, control of New Lanark passed to the Walker family when Owen left Britain to start settlement of New Harmony in the US. The Walkers managed the village until 1881, when it was sold to Birkmyre and Sommerville and the Gourock Ropeworks (although they tried unsuccessfully to sell the mills and the town in 1851). They and their successor companies remained in control until the mills closed in 1968.

The town and the industrial activity had been in decline before then, but after the mills closed migration away from the village accelerated, and the buildings began to deteriorate. The top two floors of Mill Number 1 were removed in 1945 but the building has since been restored and is now the New Lanark Mill Hotel. In 1963 the New Lanark Association (NLA) was formed as a housing association and commenced the restoration of Caithness Row and Nursery Buildings. In 1970 the mills, other industrial buildings and the houses used by Dale and Owen were sold to Metal Extractions Limited, a scrap metal company. In 1974 the NLCT (now the NLT) was founded to prevent demolition of the village. A compulsory purchase order was used in 1983 to recover the mills and other buildings from Metal Extractions after a repairs notice had been served in 1979. This was because of the state of repair of the buildings despite their listing as historic buildings that required their legal preservation in 1971. They are now controlled by the NLT, either directly through the Trust or through wholly owned companies (New Lanark Trading Ltd, New Lanark Hotel Ltd and New Lanark Homes). By 2005 most of the buildings had been restored and the village has become a major tourist attraction.

== Living conditions ==

In the mid 19th century, an entire family would have been housed in a single room. Some sense of such living conditions can be obtained by visiting the reconstructed Millworkers House at New Lanark World Heritage Site or the David Livingstone Centre at Blantyre.

David Dale, who founded New Lanark, was also involved in the mills at Blantyre. Only one tenement row has survived in Blantyre, and that building is now a museum. This is mostly devoted to David Livingstone, who was born there in 1813, both examples include re-creations of the single-room living conditions of the time at New Lanark, featuring trundle beds for children such as Livingstone would have used. The David Livingstone Centre is 18 miles by road from New Lanark, between Glasgow and Hamilton.

The living conditions in the village gradually improved, and by the early 20th century families would have had the use of several rooms. It was not until 1933 that the houses had interior cold water taps for sinks and the communal outside toilets were replaced by inside facilities.

From 1938 the village proprietors provided free electricity to all the homes in New Lanark, but only enough power was available for one dim bulb in each room. The power was switched off at 10 pm Sunday-Friday, 11 pm Saturday. In 1955 New Lanark was connected to the National Grid.

== New Lanark today ==
It has been estimated that over 400,000 people visit the village each year. The importance of New Lanark has been recognised by UNESCO as one of Scotland&#x27;s six World Heritage Sites, the others being Edinburgh Old and New Towns, Heart of Neolithic Orkney, St Kilda, the Antonine Wall and the Forth Bridge. The mills and town were listed in 2001 after an unsuccessful application for World Heritage listing in 1986.

About 130 people live in New Lanark. Of the residential buildings, only Mantilla Row has not been restored. Some of the restoration work was undertaken by the NLA and the NLCT. Braxfield Row and most of Long Row were restored by private individuals who bought the houses as derelict shells and restored them as private houses. Seven houses in Double Row have been externally restored by the NLCT and are being sold for private ownership. In addition to the 21 owner-occupied properties in the village there are 45 rented properties which were let by the NLA, which was a registered housing association. The NLA also owned other buildings in the village. In 2009 the NLA was wound up as being financially and administratively unviable, and responsibility for the village&#x27;s tenanted properties passed to the NLCT.

In 2009 Clydesdale Bank released a new series of Scottish banknotes, of which the 20-pound note features New Lanark on its reverse.

Considerable attention has been given to maintaining the historical authenticity of the village. No television aerials or satellite dishes are allowed in the village, and services such as telephone, television and electricity are delivered though buried cables. To provide a consistent appearance all external woodwork is painted white, and doors and windows follow a consistent design. Householders used to be banned from owning dogs, but this rule is no longer enforced.

Some features introduced by the NLT, such as commercial signage and a glass bridge connecting the Engine House and Mill Number Three, have been criticised. The retention of a 1924-pattern red telephone box in the village square has also been seen as inappropriate.

The mills, the hotel and most of the non-residential buildings in the village are owned and operated by the NLT through wholly owned companies.

==Historic maps==
A 1911 Ordnance Survey map is available from the National Library of Scotland.

== Buildings ==

*Braxfield Row, built c1790 – a tenement block converted to ten owner-occupied houses, nine are four-storey and one five-storey.
*Long Row, built c1790 – a tenement block converted to 14 three-storey houses. Ten are owner occupied and four are tenanted.
*Double Row, built c1795 – a tenement block of seven four-storey houses and one five-storey that were occupied from the 1790s to the 1970s. They originally contained back-to-back apartments. The side facing the river was also known as Water Row. Seven of the houses have been externally renovated to be sold as single occupancy homes. Number seven is known as the &#x27;Museum Stair&#x27; and is designated a Scheduled Monument, due to the remarkable survival of original artefacts and materials such as fireplaces, sinks, &#x27;set-in&#x27; beds, remnants of wallpaper and linoleum.
*Mantilla Row, built c1795 – a tenement block demolished when it became structurally unsafe. New foundations and some walls have been laid, but the row has not been completely rebuilt.
*Wee Row, built c1795 – a tenement block converted to a youth hostel in 1994. It was once operated by the Scottish Youth Hostels Association but is now managed by the New Lanark Mill Hotel. Closed and to be sold 
*New Buildings, built 1798 – a four-storey building containing the bell tower. The bell, which once summoned the workers to the mills, is now sounded at midnight on the last day of the year. The building contains a museum and tenanted flats.
*Nursery Buildings, built 1809 – a three-storey building that has been converted to tenanted flats. It was once used to house the orphan children who worked in the mills.
*Caithness Row, built 1792 – a three-storey tenement block that has been converted to tenanted flats. Caithness is a district in the Scottish Highlands and the row was supposedly named after a group of Highlanders recruited to work in the mills.
*Village Church, built 1898 – now used for social purposes and named the Community Hall. Has since fallen into disrepair and has become structurally unsafe.
*Mill Number One, built 1789 – originally built in 1785 and started spinning in March 1786. It burnt down on 9 October 1788 and was rebuilt in 1789. In 1802 the mill had three waterwheels driving 6556 spindles. In 1811 558 people, 408 of them female, worked in the mill. In 1945 it had its top two floors removed. The building became derelict and was renovated and rebuilt as the New Lanark Mill Hotel. The hotel opened in 1998.
*Waterhouses, built c1799-1818 – a row of one- and two-storey buildings next to Mill Number One, converted into holiday flats.
*Mill Number Two, built 1788 – in 1811 it had three waterwheels and employed 486 people, 283 of them women. It was widened in 1884–5 to accommodate ring frames. The extension is the only brick faced building in the village. It is now used for tourist purposes.
*Mill Number Three, built 1790–92 – known as &#x27;the jeanies house&#x27; and contained a large number of water powered jennies. It burned down in 1819 and was rebuilt circa 1826–33. In 1811 it employed 398 people, 286 of them women. It is now used for tourist purposes. It also contains a water turbine that generates electricity for parts of the village.
*Mill Number Four, built circa 1791-3 – initially used as a storeroom and workshop. It also housed &#x27;275 children who have no parents&#x27; (Donnachie and G. Hewitt). It was destroyed by fire in 1883 and has not been rebuilt. In 1990 a waterwheel was brought from Hole Mill Farm, Fife, and installed on the site of the mill.
*Institute for the Formation of Character, built 1816 – a four-storey building that is now used for tourism and business purposes.
*Engine House, built 1881 – attached to the Institute for the Formation of Character and contains a restored steam engine.
*School, built 1817 – a three-storey building that is now a museum. It housed the first school for working-class children in Scotland.
*Mechanics Workshop, built 1809 – a three-storey building that once housed the craftsmen who built and maintained the mill machinery.
*Dyeworks, built ? – originally a brass and iron foundry with its own waterwheel. It now contains shops and a visitor centre.
*Gasworks with octagonal chimney, built by 1851 – used as a store.
*Owens House, built 1790 – used as a museum.
*Dales House, built 1790 – used as business premises.
*Mill Lade – dug to carry water from the River Clyde to power the mill machinery.
*Graveyard – on the hill above New Lanark, between the village and the visitors&#x27; car park. Many of the first villagers are buried there.
*1 &amp; 2 New Lanark Road (locally known as the twin houses) – two opposing two-storey gatehouses some distance from the village. These marked the entrance to New Lanark. They are now in private ownership.

== Visiting New Lanark ==

There is a large paid parking car park on the outskirts of the village. Only disabled visitors may park in the village. The walk from the car park down to the mill village provides a worthwhile panoramic view. There is a bus service [Number 135] from Lanark station bus stance. The railway station has half-hourly services from Glasgow. New Lanark is just over one mile from the Lanark rail and bus stations. The walk is mainly downhill and well signposted.

The village has a four-star hotel [the New Lanark Mill Hotel], holiday flats [the Waterhouses], and Wee Row which provides hostel type accommodation. There are restaurants and shops in the village, and a visitors&#x27; centre. All are owned and operated by the New Lanark Conservation Trust.

The Clyde walkway long-distance footpath passes through the village and the Scottish Wildlife Trust&#x27;s visitor centre for the Falls of Clyde Nature reserve is based in a group of mill buildings.

<text>Kidsgrove is a town in the borough of Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, England, on the Cheshire border. It is part of the Potteries Urban Area, along with Stoke-on-Trent and Newcastle-under-Lyme. It has a population of 26,276 (2019 census). Most of the town is in the Kidsgrove ward, whilst the western part is in Ravenscliffe.

==History==

From the 18th century, Kidsgrove grew around coal mining, although the pits have now closed. Clough Hall Mansion in the town is now demolished.

The engineer James Brindley cut the first Harecastle Tunnel on the Trent and Mersey Canal near the town; Thomas Telford cut the second. Kidsgrove also marks the southern extremity of the Macclesfield Canal. There is a legend regarding a headless ghost that is said to haunt the Harecastle Tunnel. The ghost is said to be that of a young woman who was murdered inside the tunnel. She is referred to as the &quot;Kidsgrove Boggart&quot;.

R.J. Mitchell, the designer of the Spitfire fighter aircraft, was born in Butt Lane, Kidsgrove.

Kidsgrove was made an urban district in 1904 with the abolition of the Wolstanton Rural District, including the parishes of Kidsgrove and Newchapel. Talke, previously part of the Audley Urban District, was added in 1932. 

Kidsgrove is served by Kidsgrove railway station which was opened by the North Staffordshire Railway on 9 October 1848 as &quot;Harecastle&quot;, later becoming &quot;Kidsgrove Central&quot;. This railway station is still open as a junction (now &quot;Kidsgrove&quot;). However, there were two other stations on the closed loop line namely Kidsgrove Liverpool Road, opened 15 November 1875 and Market Street Halt, opened 1 July 1909.

In 1975, kidnapping victim Lesley Whittle was kept in Bathpool Park, south of Kidsgrove, in an air ventilation shaft from a disused coal mine. She was kept in the shaft for several weeks, with a noose around her neck, and was hanged. Donald Neilson, the killer known as the &quot;Black Panther,&quot; was later convicted of murdering her after repeated delays in getting the ransom.

The town has a library, post office, health centre (just outside of the main town), and supermarkets (Tesco, Lidl, Aldi). Market Street has a Home Bargains, smaller shops and many fast food restaurants. Schools include The King&#x27;s Church of England Academy, Kidsgrove Secondary School known more locally as Maryhill High School, Kidsgrove Primary School known more locally as Maryhill Primary School, St John&#x27;s Catholic School and others.

The town used to house the English Electric site on West Avenue, Nelson Industrial Estate. Over the years it went through various name changes: GEC, CEGELEC, Alstom, Converteam before finally General Electric. GE closed the Kidsgrove site in 2016 and the last remaining original building has since been demolished, leaving only the recently erected warehouse which is now under use of another company.

==Transport==
The First Potteries Bus Route numbers 7/7A, 3 and 4A buses each have terminuses in Kidsgrove, and the railway connects Kidsgrove railway station with Crewe, Manchester and Stoke-on-Trent. The Trent and Mersey Canal runs through the town. Kidsgrove is also home to a portion of the A50 road and is very close to the A34 and the A500.

==Sport==
Kidsgrove Athletic F.C. play in the .

Kidsgrove has a rugby club and a cricket club.

==Media==
Since the town is close to the Cheshire-Staffordshire border, local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North West and ITV Granada that broadcast from Salford taking television signals being received from the Winter Hill TV transmitter. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Stoke, Hits Radio Staffordshire &amp; Cheshire, Greatest Hits Radio Staffordshire &amp; Cheshire, 6 Towns Radio and HitMix Radio, a community based radio station. The Sentinel is the town&#x27;s local newspaper. 

==Kidsgrove Scouts==
Kidsgrove is home to the 1st Kidsgrove Scout Group in the district of Potteries North and were established in 1910. The group has undertaken regular tours to the DCA World Championships in the US.

==Local governance==
Kidsgrove is situated in North West Staffordshire on the Cheshire border and is part of the Borough of Newcastle-under-Lyme.

The Wards of Kidsgrove &amp; Ravenscliffe, Butt Lane &amp; Talke and Newchapel &amp; Mow Cop are in the Stoke-on-Trent North Parliamentary Constituency represented by Jonathan Gullis and whilst parts of Mow Cop currently sit within Staffordshire Moorlands Parliamentary Constituency, whose M.P. is Karen Bradley, the area would move into Stoke-on-Trent North under the Boundary Review currently underway.

Kidsgrove has a Town Council of twenty members, separated into four Wards, Talke and Butt Lane, Kidsgrove Central &amp; Ravenscliffe, Hardings Wood and Newchapel &amp; Mow Cop. Kidsgrove Town Council was created in 1974 when Kidsgrove Urban District Council was abolished when the area was absorbed by Newcastle Under Lyme Borough Council under the Local Government Act 1972. Kidsgrove has a mayor who is elected by the Town Council every 12 months. This position is mainly a civic role, and the Mayor acts as an ambassador for Kidsgrove. Kidsgrove Town Council is based at Kidsgrove Town Hall.

==Rotary Kidsgrove==
Founded on 15 January 1969 and presented with its charter on 2 July the same year, the Rotary Club of Kidsgrove (RCK) has been active within the community whether fundraising, volunteering or helping out local projects for over 50 years. The club is also part of District 1210 within Rotary International in Britain and Ireland.

Originally meeting in the Masonic Hall and Institute in the town, the group now gets together at the Red Bull, Church Lawton.

During November RCK hold a bonfire night and fireworks at Clough Hall Park and during December they can be seen on the streets of Kidsgrove with their Santa float, collecting for local good causes.

In April 2012 RCK were also announced as the Rotary International in Britain and Ireland winners of the Club Online Presence Award. This was the first time the award has been presented and recognises the achievements the group have made through their website and a variety of social media avenues in the year.

<text>Science and technology studies (STS) or science, technology, and society is an interdisciplinary field that examines the creation, development, and consequences of science and technology in their historical, cultural, and social contexts.

==History==
Like most interdisciplinary fields of study, STS emerged from the confluence of a variety of disciplines and disciplinary subfields, all of which had developed an interest—typically, during the 1960s or 1970s—in viewing science and technology as socially embedded enterprises. The key disciplinary components of STS took shape independently, beginning in the 1960s, and developed in isolation from each other well into the 1980s, although Ludwik Fleck&#x27;s (1935) monograph &quot;Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact&quot; anticipated many of STS&#x27;s key themes. In the 1970s Elting E. Morison founded the STS program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which served as a model. By 2011, 111 STS research centers and academic programs were counted worldwide.

=== Important key points ===
*History of technology, that examines technology in its social and historical context. Starting in the 1960s, some historians questioned technological determinism, a doctrine that can induce public passivity to technologic and scientific &quot;natural&quot; development. At the same time, some historians began to develop similarly contextual approaches to the history of medicine.
* History and philosophy of science (1960s). After the publication of Thomas Kuhn&#x27;s well-known &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot; (1962), which attributed changes in scientific theories to changes in underlying intellectual paradigms, programs were founded at the University of California, Berkeley and elsewhere that brought historians of science and philosophers together in unified programs.
*Science, technology, and society. In the mid-to-late-1960s, student and faculty social movements in the U.S., UK, and European universities helped to launch a range of new interdisciplinary fields (such as women&#x27;s studies) that were seen to address relevant topics that the traditional curriculum ignored. One such development was the rise of &quot;science, technology, and society&quot; programs, which are also—confusingly—known by the STS acronym. Drawn from a variety of disciplines, including anthropology, history, political science, and sociology, scholars in these programs created undergraduate curricula devoted to exploring the issues raised by science and technology. Feminist scholars in this and other emerging STS areas addressed themselves to the exclusion of women from science and engineering, focusing instead on critiquing gendered power dynamics in prior STS research.
*Science, engineering, and public policy studies emerged in the 1970s from the same concerns that motivated the founders of the science, technology, and society movement: A sense that science and technology were developing in ways that were increasingly at odds with the public&#x27;s best interests. The science, technology, and society movement tried to humanize those who would make tomorrow&#x27;s science and technology, but this discipline took a different approach: It would train students with the professional skills needed to become players in science and technology policy. Some programs came to emphasize quantitative methodologies, and most of these were eventually absorbed into systems engineering. Others emphasized sociological and qualitative approaches, and found that their closest kin could be found among scholars in science, technology, and society departments.

During the 1970s and 1980s, universities in the US, UK, and Europe began drawing these various components together in new, interdisciplinary programs. For example, in the 1970s, Cornell University developed a new program that united science studies and policy-oriented scholars with historians and philosophers of science and technology. Each of these programs developed unique identities due to variations in the components that were drawn together, as well as their location within the various universities. For example, the University of Virginia&#x27;s STS program united scholars drawn from a variety of fields (with particular strength in the history of technology); however, the program&#x27;s teaching responsibilities—it is located within an engineering school and teaches ethics to undergraduate engineering students—means that all of its faculty share a strong interest in engineering ethics.

===The &quot;turn to technology&quot; (and beyond)===
A decisive moment in the development of STS was the mid-1980s addition of technology studies to the range of interests reflected in science. During that decade, two works appeared &quot;en seriatim&quot; that signaled what Steve Woolgar was to call the &quot;turn to technology&quot;. In a seminal 1984 article, Trevor Pinch and Wiebe Bijker showed how the sociology of technology could proceed along the theoretical and methodological lines established by the sociology of scientific knowledge. This was the intellectual foundation of the field they called the social construction of technology. Donald MacKenzie and Judy Wajcman primed the pump by publishing a collection of articles attesting to the influence of society on technological design (&quot;Social Shaping of Technology&quot;, 1985). Social science research continued to interrogate STS research from this point onward as researchers moved from post-modern to post-structural frameworks of thought, Bijker and Pinch contributing to SCOT knowledge and Wajcman providing boundary work through a feminist lens.

The &quot;turn to technology&quot; helped to cement an already growing awareness of underlying unity among the various emerging STS programs. More recently, there has been an associated turn to ecology, nature, and materiality in general, whereby the socio-technical and natural/material co-produce each other. This is especially evident in work in STS analyses of biomedicine (such as Carl May and Annemarie Mol) and ecological interventions (such as Bruno Latour, Sheila Jasanoff, Matthias Gross, Sara B. Pritchard, and S. Lochlann Jain).

==Important concepts==
=== Social construction(s)===
Social constructions are human-created ideas, objects, or events created by a series of choices and interactions. These interactions have consequences that change the perception that different groups of people have on these constructs. Some examples of social construction include class, race, money, and citizenship.

The following also alludes to the notion that not everything is set, a circumstance or result could potentially be one way or the other. According to the article &quot;What is Social Construction?&quot; by Ian Hacking, &quot;Social construction work is critical of the status quo. Social constructionists about X tend to hold that:
# X need not have existed, or need not be at all as it is. X, or X as it is at present, is not determined by the nature of things; it is not inevitable
Very often they go further, and urge that:
# X is quite as bad as it is.
# We would be much better off if X were done away with, or at least radically transformed.&quot; 
In the past, there have been viewpoints that were widely regarded as fact until being called to question due to the introduction of new knowledge. Such viewpoints include the past concept of a correlation between intelligence and the nature of a human&#x27;s ethnicity or race (X may not be at all as it is).

An example of the evolution and interaction of various social constructions within science and technology can be found in the development of both the high-wheel bicycle, or velocipede, and then of the bicycle. The velocipede was widely used in the latter half of the 19th century. In the latter half of the 19th century, a social need was first recognized for a more efficient and rapid means of transportation. Consequently, the velocipede was first developed, which was able to reach higher translational velocities than the smaller non-geared bicycles of the day, by replacing the front wheel with a larger radius wheel. One notable trade-off was a certain decreased stability leading to a greater risk of falling. This trade-off resulted in many riders getting into accidents by losing balance while riding the bicycle or being thrown over the handlebars.

The first &quot;social construction&quot; or progress of the velocipede caused the need for a newer &quot;social construction&quot; to be recognized and developed into a safer bicycle design. Consequently, the velocipede was then developed into what is now commonly known as the &quot;bicycle&quot; to fit within society&#x27;s newer &quot;social construction,&quot; the newer standards of higher vehicle safety. Thus the popularity of the modern geared bicycle design came as a response to the first social construction, the original need for greater speed, which had caused the high-wheel bicycle to be designed in the first place. The popularity of the modern geared bicycle design ultimately ended the widespread use of the velocipede itself, as eventually it was found to best accomplish the social needs/social constructions of both greater speed and of greater safety.

=== Material semiotics ===
With methodology from ANT, feminist STS theorists built upon SCOT&#x27;s theory of co-construction to explore the relationship between gender and technology, proposing one cannot exist separately from the other. This approach suggests the material and social are not separate, reality being produced through interactions and studied through representations of those realities. Building on Steve Woolgar&#x27;s boundary work on user configuration, feminist critiques shifted the focus away from users of technology and science towards whether technology and science represent a fixed, unified reality. According to this approach, identity could no longer be treated as causal in human interactions with technology as it cannot exist prior to that interaction, feminist STS researchers proposing a &quot;double-constructivist&quot; approach to account for this contradiction. John Law credits feminist STS scholars for contributing material-semiotic approaches to the broader discipline of STS, stating that research not only attempts to describe reality, but enacts it through the research process.

=== Sociotechnical imaginaries (STIs) ===
Sociotechnical imaginaries are what certain communities, societies, and nations envision as achievable through the combination of scientific innovation and social changes. These visions can be based on what is possible to achieve for a certain society, and can also show what a certain state or nation desires. STIs are often bound with ideologies and ambitions of those who create and circulate them. Sociotechnical imaginaries can be created by states and policymakers, smaller groups within society, or can be a result of the interaction of both.

The term was coined in 2009 by Sheila Jasanoff and Sang-Hyun Kim who compared and contrasted sociotechnical imaginaries of nuclear energy in the USA with those of South Korea over the second half of the 20th century. Jasanoff and Kim analyzed the discourse of government representatives, national policies, and civil society organizations, looked at the technological and infrastructural developments, and social protests, and conducted interviews with experts. They concluded that in South Korea nuclear energy was imagined mostly as the means of national development, while in the US the dominant sociotechnical imaginary framed nuclear energy as risky and in need of containment.

The concept has been applied to several objects of study including biomedical research, nanotechnology development and energy systems and climate change. Within energy systems, research has focused on nuclear energy, fossil fuels, renewables as well as broader topics of energy transitions, and the development of new technologies to address climate change.

=== Sociotechnical systems theory ===
Social technical systems are an interplay between technologies and humans, this is clearly expressed in the sociotechnical systems theory. To expound on this interplay, humans fulfill and define tasks, then humans in companies use IT and IT supports people, and finally, IT processes tasks and new IT generates new tasks. This IT redefines work practices. This is what we call the sociotechnical systems. In socio-technical systems, there are two principles to internalize, that is joint optimization and complementarity. Joint optimization puts an emphasis on developing both systems in parallel and it is only in the interaction of both systems that the success of an organization arises. The principle of complementarity means that both systems have to be optimized. If you focus on one system and have bias over the other it will likely lead to the failure of the organization or jeopardize the success of a system. Although the above socio-technical system theory is focused on an organization, it is undoubtedly imperative to correlate this theory and its principles to society today and in science and technology studies.

According to Barley and Bailey, there is a  tendency for AI designers and scholars of design studies to privilege the technical over the social, focusing more on taking &quot;humans out of the loop&quot; paradigm than the &quot;augmented intelligence&quot; paradigm.

Recent work on artificial intelligence considers large sociotechnical systems, such as social networks and online marketplaces, as agents whose behavior can be purposeful and adaptive. The behavior of recommender systems can therefore be analyzed in the language and framework of sociotechnical systems, leading also to a new perspective for their legal regulation.

=== Technoscience ===
Technoscience is a subset of Science, Technology, and Society studies that focuses on the inseparable connection between science and technology. It states that fields are linked and grow together, and scientific knowledge requires an infrastructure of technology in order to remain stationary or move forward. Both technological development and scientific discovery drive one another towards more advancement. Technoscience excels at shaping human thoughts and behavior by opening up new possibilities that gradually or quickly come to be perceived as necessities.

=== Technosocial ===
&quot;Technological action is a social process.&quot; Social factors and technology are intertwined so that they are dependent upon each other. This includes the aspect that social, political, and economic factors are inherent in technology and that social structure influences what technologies are pursued. In other words, &quot;technoscientific phenomena combined inextricably with social/political/economic/psychological phenomena, so &#x27;technology&#x27; includes a spectrum of artifacts, techniques, organizations, and systems.&quot; Winner expands on this idea by saying &quot;in the late twentieth-century technology and society, technology and culture, technology and politics are by no means separate.&quot;

====Examples====
* Ford Pinto – Ford Motor Company sold and produced the Pinto during the 1970s. A flaw in the automobile design of the rear gas tank caused a fiery explosion upon impact. The exploding fuel tank killed and injured hundreds of people. Internal documents of test results proved Ford CEO Lee Iacocca and engineers were aware of the flaw. The company decided to ignore improving its technology because of profit-driven motives, strict internal control, and competition from foreign competitors such as Volkswagen. Ford Motor Company conducted a cost-benefit analysis to determine if altering the Ford Pinto model was feasible. An analysis conducted by Ford employees argued against a new design because of increased cost. Employees were also under tight control by the CEO who rushed the Pinto through production lines to increase profits. Ford finally changed after public scrutiny. Safety organizations later influenced this technology by requiring stricter safety standards for motor vehicles.
* DDT/toxins – DDT was a common and highly effective insecticide used during the 1940s until its ban in the early 1970s. It was utilized during World War 2 to combat insect-borne human diseases that plagued military members and civilian populations. People and companies soon realized other benefits of DDT for agricultural purposes. Rachel Carson became worried about widespread use on public health and the environment. Rachel Carson&#x27;s book &quot;Silent Spring&quot; left an imprint on the industry by claiming the linkage of DDT to many serious illnesses such as cancer. Carson&#x27;s book drew criticism from chemical companies who felt their reputation and business threatened by such claims. DDT was eventually banned by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) after a long and arduous process of research on the chemical substance. The main cause for the removal of DDT was the public deciding that any benefits were outweighed by the potential health risk.
* Autopilots/computer-aided tasks (CATs) – From a security point of view the effects of making a task more computer-driven is in the favor of technological advance because there is less reaction time required and computational error than a human pilot. Due to reduced error and reaction times flights on average, using autopilot, have been shown to be safer. Thus technology has a direct impact on people by increasing their safety, and society affects technology because people want to be safer so they are constantly trying to improve the autopilot systems.
* Cell phones – Cell phone technology emerged in the early 1920s after advancements were made in radio technology. Engineers at Bell Laboratories, the research, and development division of AT&amp;T discovered that cell towers can transmit and receive signals to and from many directions. The discovery by Bell Labs revolutionized the capabilities and outcomes of cellular technology. Technology only improved once mobile phone users could communicate outside of a designated area. First-generation mobile phones were first created and sold by Motorola. Their phone was only intended for use in cars. Second-generation mobile phone capabilities continued to improve because of the switch to digital. Phones were faster which enhanced the communication capabilities of customers. They were also sleeker and weighed less than bulky first-generation technology. Technological advances boosted customer satisfaction and broadened cell phone companies&#x27; customer base. Third-generation technology changed the way people interact with others. Now customers had access to Wi-Fi, texting and other applications. Mobile phones are now entering into the fourth generation. Cellular and mobile phones revolutionized the way people socialize and communicate in order to establish a modern social structure. People have affected the development of this technology by demanding features such as larger screens, touch capabilities, and internet accessibility.
* Internet – The internet arose because of extensive research on ARPANET between various universities, corporations, and ARPA (Advanced Research Project Agency), an agency of the Department of Defense. Scientists theorized a network of computers connected to each other. Computing capabilities contributed to developments and the creation of the modern-day computer or laptop. The internet has become a normal part of life and business, to such a degree that the United Nations views it as a basic human right. The internet is becoming larger, one way is that more things are being moved into the digital world due to demand, for example, online banking. It has drastically changed the way most people go about daily habits.

===Deliberative democracy===
Deliberative democracy is a reform of representative or direct democracies which mandates discussion and debate of popular topics which affect society. Deliberative democracy is a tool for making decisions. Deliberative democracy can be traced back all the way to Aristotle&#x27;s writings. More recently, the term was coined by Joseph Bessette in his 1980 work &quot;Deliberative Democracy: The Majority Principle in Republican Government&quot;, where he uses the idea in opposition to the elitist interpretations of the United States Constitution with emphasis on public discussion.

Deliberative democracy can lead to more legitimate, credible, and trustworthy outcomes. Deliberative democracy allows for &quot;a wider range of public knowledge&quot;, and it has been argued that this can lead to &quot;more socially intelligent and robust&quot; science. One major shortcoming of deliberative democracy is that many models insufficiently ensure critical interaction.

According to Ryfe, there are five mechanisms that stand out as critical to the successful design of deliberative democracy:
*Rules of equality, civility, and inclusivity may prompt deliberation even when our first impulse is to avoid it.
*Stories anchor reality by organizing experience and instilling a normative commitment to civic identities and values, and function as a medium for framing discussions.
*Leadership provides important cues to individuals in deliberative settings and can keep groups on a deliberative track when their members slip into routine and habit.
*Individuals are more likely to sustain deliberative reasoning when they have a stake in the outcomes.
*Apprenticeship teaches citizens to deliberate well. We might do well to imagine education as a form of apprenticeship learning, in which individuals learn to deliberate by doing it in concert with others more skilled in the activity.

==== Importance ====
Recently, there has been a movement towards greater transparency in the fields of policy and technology. Jasanoff comes to the conclusion that there is no longer a question of if there needs to be increased public participation in making decisions about science and technology, but now there need to be ways to make a more meaningful conversation between the public and those developing the technology.

==== In practice ====
Bruce Ackerman and James S. Fishkin offered an example of a reform in their paper &quot;Deliberation Day.&quot; The deliberation is to enhance public understanding of popular, complex and controversial issues through devices such as Fishkin&#x27;s deliberative polling, though implementation of these reforms is unlikely in a large government such as that of the United States. However, things similar to this have been implemented in small, local governments like New England towns and villages. New England town hall meetings are a good example of deliberative democracy in a realistic setting.

An ideal deliberative democracy balances the voice and influence of all participants. While the main aim is to reach consensus, deliberative democracy should encourage the voices of those with opposing viewpoints, concerns due to uncertainties, and questions about assumptions made by other participants. It should take its time and ensure that those participating understand the topics on which they debate. Independent managers of debates should also have a substantial grasp of the concepts discussed, but must &quot;[remain] independent and impartial as to the outcomes of the process.&quot;

===Tragedy of the commons===
In 1968, Garrett Hardin popularised the phrase &quot;tragedy of the commons.&quot; It is an economic theory where rational people act against the best interest of the group by consuming a common resource. Since then, the tragedy of the commons has been used to symbolize the degradation of the environment whenever many individuals use a common resource. Although Garrett Hardin was not an STS scholar, the concept of the tragedy of the commons still applies to science, technology, and society.

In a contemporary setting, the Internet acts as an example of the tragedy of the commons through the exploitation of digital resources and private information. Data and internet passwords can be stolen much more easily than physical documents. Virtual spying is almost free compared to the costs of physical spying. Additionally, net neutrality can be seen as an example of tragedy of the commons in an STS context. The movement for net neutrality argues that the Internet should not be a resource that is dominated by one particular group, specifically those with more money to spend on Internet access.

A counterexample to the tragedy of the commons is offered by Andrew Kahrl. Privatization can be a way to deal with the tragedy of the commons. However, Kahrl suggests that the privatization of beaches on Long Island, in an attempt to combat the overuse of Long Island beaches, made the residents of Long Island more susceptible to flood damage from Hurricane Sandy. The privatization of these beaches took away from the protection offered by the natural landscape. Tidal lands that offer natural protection were drained and developed. This attempt to combat the tragedy of the commons by privatization was counter-productive. Privatization actually destroyed the public good of natural protection from the landscape.

===Alternative modernity===
Alternative modernity is a conceptual tool conventionally used to represent the state of present western society. Modernity represents the political and social structures of society, the sum of interpersonal discourse, and ultimately a snapshot of society&#x27;s direction at a point in time. Unfortunately, conventional modernity is incapable of modeling alternative directions for further growth within our society. Also, this concept is ineffective at analyzing similar but unique modern societies such as those found in the diverse cultures of the developing world. Problems can be summarized into two elements: inward failure to analyze the growth potentials of a given society, and outward failure to model different cultures and social structures and predict their growth potentials.

Previously, modernity carried a connotation of the current state of being modern, and its evolution through European colonialism. The process of becoming &quot;modern&quot; is believed to occur in a linear, pre-determined way, and is seen by Philip Brey as a way to interpret and evaluate social and cultural formations. This thought ties in with modernization theory, the thought that societies progress from &quot;pre-modern&quot; to &quot;modern&quot; societies.

Within the field of science and technology, there are two main lenses with which to view modernity. The first is as a way for society to quantify what it wants to move towards. In effect, we can discuss the notion of &quot;alternative modernity&quot; (as described by Andrew Feenberg) and which of these we would like to move towards. Alternatively, modernity can be used to analyze the differences in interactions between cultures and individuals. From this perspective, alternative modernities exist simultaneously, based on differing cultural and societal expectations of how a society (or an individual within society) should function. Because of different types of interactions across different cultures, each culture will have a different modernity.

===Pace of innovation===
The pace of innovation is the speed at which technological innovation or advancement is occurring, with the most apparent instances being too slow or too rapid. Both these rates of innovation are extreme and therefore have effects on the people that get to use this technology.

===No innovation without representation===
&quot;No innovation without representation&quot; is a democratic ideal of ensuring that everyone involved gets a chance to be represented fairly in technological developments.

* Langdon Winner states that groups and social interests likely to be affected by a particular kind of technological change ought to be represented at an early stage in defining exactly what that technology will be. It is the idea that relevant parties have a say in technological developments and are not left in the dark.
* Spoken about by Massimiano Bucchi
* This ideal does not require the public to become experts on the topics of science and engineering, it only asks that the opinions and ideas be heard before making drastic decisions, as talked about by Steven L. Goldman.

===Legacy thinking===

Legacy thinking is defined as an inherited method of thinking imposed from an external source without objection by the individual because it is already widely accepted by society.

Legacy thinking can impair the ability to drive technology for the betterment of society by blinding people to innovations that do not fit into their accepted model of how society works. By accepting ideas without questioning them, people often see all solutions that contradict these accepted ideas as impossible or impractical. Legacy thinking tends to advantage the wealthy, who have the means to project their ideas on the public. It may be used by the wealthy as a vehicle to drive technology in their favor rather than for the greater good.
Examining the role of citizen participation and representation in politics provides an excellent example of legacy thinking in society. The belief that one can spend money freely to gain influence has been popularized, leading to public acceptance of corporate lobbying. As a result, a self-established role in politics has been cemented where the public does not exercise the power ensured to them by the Constitution to the fullest extent. This can become a barrier to political progress as corporations who have the capital to spend have the potential to wield great influence over policy. Legacy thinking, however, keeps the population from acting to change this, despite polls from Harris Interactive that report over 80% of Americans to feel that big business holds too much power in government. Therefore, Americans are beginning to try to steer away from this line of thought, rejecting legacy thinking, and demanding less corporate, and more public, participation in political decision-making.

Additionally, an examination of net neutrality functions as a separate example of legacy thinking. Starting with dial-up, the internet has always been viewed as a private luxury good. Internet today is a vital part of modern-day society members. They use it in and out of life every day. Corporations are able to mislabel and greatly overcharge for their internet resources. Since the American public is so dependent upon the internet there is little for them to do. Legacy thinking has kept this pattern on track despite growing movements arguing that the internet should be considered a utility. Legacy thinking prevents progress because it was widely accepted by others before us through advertising that the internet is a luxury and not a utility. Due to pressure from grassroots movements the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has redefined the requirements for broadband and internet in general as a utility. Now AT&amp;T and other major internet providers are lobbying against this action and are in large able to delay the onset of this movement due to legacy thinking&#x27;s grip on American culture and politics.

For example, those who cannot overcome the barrier of legacy thinking may not consider the privatization of clean drinking water as an issue. This is partial because access to water has become such a given fact of the matter to them. For a person living in such circumstances, it may be widely accepted to not concern themselves with drinking water because they have not needed to be concerned with it in the past. Additionally, a person living within an area that does not need to worry about their water supply or the sanitation of their water supply is less likely to be concerned with the privatization of water.

This notion can be examined through the thought experiment of &quot;veil of ignorance&quot;. Legacy thinking causes people to be particularly ignorant about the implications behind the &quot;you get what you pay for&quot; mentality applied to a life necessity. By utilizing the &quot;veil of ignorance&quot;, one can overcome the barrier of legacy thinking as it requires a person to imagine that they are unaware of their own circumstances, allowing them to free themselves from externally imposed thoughts or widely accepted ideas.

* Technological pessimism – The opinion that technology has negative effects on society and should be discouraged from use.
* Technological neutrality – &quot;maintains that a given technology has no systematic effects on society: individuals are perceived as ultimately responsible, for better or worse, because technologies are merely tools people use for their own ends.&quot;
* Technological determinism – &quot;maintains that technologies are understood as simply and directly causing particular societal outcomes.&quot;
* Scientism – The belief in the total separation of facts and values.

== Academic programs ==
STS is taught in several countries. According to the STS wiki, STS programs can be found in twenty countries, including 45 programs in the United States, three programs in India, and eleven programs in the UK. STS programs can be found in Canada, Germany, Israel, Malaysia, and Taiwan. Some examples of institutions offering STS programs are Stanford University, University College London, Harvard University, the University of Oxford, Mines ParisTech, Bar-Ilan University, and York University. In Europe the European Inter-University Association on Society, Science and Technology (ESST) offers an MA degree in STS through study programs and student exchanges with over a dozen specializations.

==Professional associations==
The field has professional associations in regions and countries around the world.

===In Europe===
* In Europe, the European Association for the Study of Science and Technology (EASST) was founded in 1981 to &quot;improve scholarly communication and exchange in the field&quot;, &quot;increase the visibility of the subject to policy-makers and to the general public&quot;, and &quot;stimulate and support teaching on the subject at all levels&quot;. Similarly, the European Inter-University Association on Society, Science and Technology (ESST) researches and studies science and technology in society, in both historical and contemporary perspectives.
* In European nation states and language communities, a range of STS associations exist, including in the UK, Spain, Germany, Austria, Turkey. In some states, several formal associations exist.
** For instance, in 2015, the UK-based Association for Studies in Innovation, Science and Technology (AsSIST-UK) was established, chaired by Andrew Webster (York) and Robin Williams (Edinburgh) principally to foster stronger integration between the innovation studies and STS fields. In 2021 it had a membership of 380. It holds annual conferences and has built strong links to policy practitioners in Westminster.
**In Italy, STS Italia – The Italian Society for Social Studies of Science and Technology was founded in 2005. Its mission is &quot;to build up an Italian network of researchers oriented to study Science and Technology starting from the social dynamics which characterize and interweave science and technology themselves&quot;.
**In Sweden, the Swedish Network for Science and Technology Studies was founded in 2006, at the first national Swedish Conference for STS, &quot;STS Dagarna&quot;.
**In Germany several STS associations exist, including the Gesellschaft für Wissenschafts- und Technikforschung, founded in 1987 or the stsing network, labelled &quot;Doing Science and Technology Studies in and through Germany&quot;, founded 2020, a early career research network called INSIST and various STS-related sub-groups of the larger disciplinary associations (like sociology).

===In Asia===
* The Asia Pacific Science Technology &amp; Society Network (APSTSN) primarily had members from Australasia, Southeast and East Asia and Oceania. APSTSN is not currently active.
* In Japan, the Japanese Society for Science and Technology Studies (JSSTS) was founded in 2001.
* The Australasian Science and Technology Studies Network (AusSTS) was founded in 2017 based at Deakin University. AusSTS now has several nodes in Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand and holds an annual workshop.
* In India, the Science and Technology Studies-India Network (STS-IN) was formed in December 2023. The Inaugural workshop was held on December 14 and 15, 2023, at Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad.

===In Latin America===
* Estudios Sociales de la Ciencia y la Tecnología (ESOCITE) is the biggest association of Science and Technology studies. The study of STS (CyT in Spanish, CTS in Portuguese) here was shaped by authors like and Jorge Sabato and in Argentina, José Leite Lopes in Brazil, Miguel Wionczek in Mexico, Francisco Sagasti in Peru, Máximo Halty Carrere in Uruguay and Marcel Roche in Venezuela.

===In North America ===
* Founded in 1975, the Society for Social Studies of Science initially provided scholarly communication facilities, including a journal (&quot;Science, Technology, and Human Values&quot;) and annual meetings that were mainly attended by science studies scholars. The society has since grown into the most important professional association of science and technology studies scholars worldwide. The Society for Social Studies of Science members also include government and industry officials concerned with research and development as well as science and technology policy; scientists and engineers who wish to better understand the social embeddedness of their professional practice; and citizens concerned about the impact of science and technology in their lives.
* Founded in 1958, the Society for the History of Technology initially attracted members from the history profession who had interests in the contextual history of technology. After the &quot;turn to technology&quot; in the mid-1980s, the society&#x27;s well-regarded journal (&quot;Technology and Culture&quot;) and its annual meetings began to attract considerable interest from non-historians with technology studies interests.
* Less identified with STS, but also of importance to many STS scholars, are the History of Science Society, the Philosophy of Science Association, and the American Association for the History of Medicine.
* Additionally, within the US there are significant STS-oriented special interest groups within major disciplinary associations, including the American Anthropological Association, the American Political Science Association, the National Women&#x27;s Studies Association, and the American Sociological Association.

<doc id="411594" wikidata="Q339016" url="?curid=411594" title="Distinguished Conduct Medal">
<text>The Distinguished Conduct Medal was a decoration established in 1854 by Queen Victoria for gallantry in the field by other ranks of the British Army. It is the oldest British award for gallantry and was a second level military decoration, ranking below the Victoria Cross, until it was discontinued in 1993 when it was replaced by the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross. The medal was also awarded to non-commissioned military personnel of other Commonwealth Dominions and Colonies.

==Institution==
The Distinguished Conduct Medal was instituted by Royal Warrant on 4 December 1854, during the Crimean War, as an award to warrant officers, non-commissioned officers and men of the British Army for &quot;distinguished, gallant and good conduct in the field&quot;. For all ranks below commissioned officer, it was the second highest award for gallantry in action after the Victoria Cross, and the other ranks equivalent of the Distinguished Service Order, which was awarded only to commissioned officers.

Prior to its institution, there had been no official medal awarded by the British Crown in recognition of individual acts of gallantry in the Army. The Meritorious Service Medal, established in 1845 to reward long serving warrant officers and sergeants, was awarded several times up to 1854 for gallantry in action, although this was not the medal&#x27;s main purpose. One earlier award specifically for acts of gallantry by other ranks was the unofficial Sir Harry Smith&#x27;s Medal for Gallantry, instituted by Major General Sir Harry Smith in 1851. Although the British government initially disapproved of Sir Harry&#x27;s institution of the medal, it subsequently paid for it and thereby gave it recognition, but not official status.

The Distinguished Conduct Medal was awarded with a gratuity, that varied in amount depending on rank, and given on the recipient&#x27;s discharge from the Army.

Since January 1918 recipients have been entitled to the post-nominal letters DCM.

A bar to the medal, introduced in 1881, could be awarded in recognition of each subsequent act of distinguished conduct for which the medal would have been awarded.

During the First World War, concern arose that the high number of medals being awarded would devalue the medal&#x27;s prestige. The Military Medal was therefore instituted on 25 March 1916 as an alternative and lower award, with the Distinguished Conduct Medal reserved for more exceptional acts of bravery. Around 25,000 Distinguished Conduct Medals were awarded during the First World War, with approximately 1,900 during the Second World War.

==Eligibility==
The Distinguished Conduct Medal could also be awarded to military personnel serving in any of the Sovereign&#x27;s forces in the British Empire, with the first awards to colonial troops made in 1872, to the West India Regiment. Members of the Indian Army remained ineligible since they could receive the Indian Order of Merit and, from 1907, the Indian Distinguished Service Medal.

From September 1916, members of the Royal Naval Division were made eligible for military decorations, including the Distinguished Conduct Medal, for the war&#x27;s duration. Otherwise, it remained an exclusively Army award until 1942, when other ranks of the Royal Navy, Royal Air Force and the Navies and Air Forces of the Dominions and Colonies also became eligible for distinguished conduct in action on the ground.

In 1979 eligibility for a number of British awards, including the DCM, was extended to permit posthumous awards. Until that time, only the Victoria Cross and a mention in dispatches could be awarded posthumously.

==Adoption==
In May 1894, Queen Victoria authorised Colonial governments to adopt various military medals for award to their local military forces. The Colony of Natal and the Cape Colony introduced this system in August and September 1894 respectively, and the Transvaal Colony followed in December 1902, while Australia, Canada and New Zealand also adopted the medal. However, only the Natal and Canada versions were finally awarded.

A territorial version of the Distinguished Conduct Medal was approved for the Union of South Africa in 1913, but was never awarded. More than 300 members of the Union Defence Forces were awarded the applicable British versions of the decoration during the two World Wars.

In 1903 specific African Distinguished Conduct Medals were established for the King&#x27;s African Rifles and the Royal West African Frontier Force. These were superseded by the British Distinguished Conduct Medal in 1943.

These colonial Distinguished Conduct Medals were of the same design as the British version, with an additional territorial or unit inscription on the reverse, in a curved line above the regular inscription.

==Discontinuation==
In the aftermath of the 1993 review of the British honours system, which formed part of the drive to remove distinctions of rank in respect of awards for bravery, the Distinguished Conduct Medal was discontinued, as was the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal and the award, specifically for gallantry, of the Distinguished Service Order. These three decorations were replaced by the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross, to serve as the second level award for gallantry for all ranks of all the Arms of the Service.

After the Second World War, most Commonwealth countries created their own honours system and no longer recommended British awards. The last Distinguished Conduct Medal awards for the Canadian Army were for Korea. The last Australian DCM award was announced in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; on 1 September 1972 for Vietnam, as was the last New Zealand award, announced on 25 September 1970. Canada, Australia and New Zealand replaced the DCM in the 1990s, as part of the creation of their own gallantry awards under their own honours systems.

==Order of wear==
In the order of wear prescribed by the British Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood, the Distinguished Conduct Medal ranks on par with the Distinguished Conduct Medal (Natal) and takes precedence after the Air Force Cross and before the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal.

==Description==


The medal was struck in silver and is a disk, in diameter and thick. The suspender of all versions is of an ornamented scroll pattern. The manner of attachment of the suspender to the medal varied between medal versions and, on early versions, allows the medal to swivel.&lt;br&gt;All medals awarded bear the recipient&#x27;s number, rank, name and unit on the rim.

;Obverse
There were eight variants of the obverse:
* The original Victorian obverse shows a Trophy of Arms, designed by Benedetto Pistrucci, incorporating a central shield bearing the Royal Coat of Arms without any inscription, as also seen on early Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal. From 1902, after the accession of King Edward VII, the effigy of the reigning monarch replaced the trophy of arms, with the respective titles of the monarch inscribed around the perimeter:
* King Edward VII – &quot;EDWARDVS VII REX IMPERATOR&quot;.
* King George V, bareheaded – &quot;GEORGIVS V BRITT: OMN: REX ET IND: IMP:&quot;.
* King George V, crowned – &quot;GEORGIVS•V•D•G•BRITT•OMN•REX•ET•INDIÆ•IMP•&quot;. Issued for awards in the 1930s.
* King George VI – There were two versions, with those inscribed &quot;GEORGIVS VI D:G:BR OMN REX ET INDIAE IMP:&quot; awarded during the Second World War and immediately after, and &quot;GEORGIVS VI DEI GRA: BRITT: OMN: REX FID: DEF:&quot; current from the late 1940s. This second type was awarded, instead of the Elizabeth II version, to Canadians during the Korean War.
* Queen Elizabeth II – Two versions, with those inscribed &quot;ELIZABETH II D:G:BR:OMN: REGINA F:D:&quot; awarded in the mid-1950s and &quot;ELIZABETH II DEI GRATIA REGINA F.D&quot; awarded thereafter until 1993.

;Reverse
The reverse of all versions is smooth, with a raised rim, and bears the inscription &quot;FOR DISTINGUISHED CONDUCT IN THE FIELD&quot; in four lines, underlined by a laurel wreath between two spear blades.

;Bars
The bar for a second or subsequent award is straight and also of silver. Bars awarded between 1881 and mid–1916 bear the month and year of the subsequent award, while those awarded after mid–1916 bear a laurel-spray and no date. In undress uniform or on occasions when only ribbons are worn, a silver rosette is worn on the ribbon to indicate the award of each bar.

;Ribbon
The ribbon is 32 millimetres wide and dark crimson, with a 10 millimetres wide navy blue band in the centre.

==Recipients==
All awards of the Distinguished Conduct Medal were notified in the London Gazette and, during the First World War, citations were generally also included.

From 1854 to 1914 3,529 medals and 13 second award bars were awarded. Of these, about 808 medals were awarded for the Crimean War and 2,092 for the Second Boer War, with some of the latter being the Edward VII version. During the Boer War, six medals were awarded posthumously and six dated bars were awarded, three of them to recipients who had won their first Distinguished Conduct Medal in this war.

For the First World War, 24,620 medals as well as 472 first bars and nine second bars were awarded, with 46 further awards for the period 1920–39.

For the Second World War, 1,891 medals and nine first bars were awarded.

Post War, a total of 153 DCMs were earned between 1947 and 1979, including 45 to Australian and New Zealand forces for service in Vietnam. A further 25 awards were made after 1979, nine for service in Northern Ireland, eight for the South Atlantic, and eight for the Gulf War, including a number of retrospective awards up to 2006.

Honorary awards of the Distinguished Conduct Medal were made to members of allied forces, including 5,227 for the First World War and 107 for the Second World War. (Lists of WW1 awards to allied forces are kept in country specific files within the WO 388/6 series at Kew, and were published in 2018.)

;Australia
Beginning in the Second Boer War, the Distinguished Conduct Medal has been awarded to 2,071 members of the Australian Army and to three members of the Royal Australian Air Force. Thirty first Bars were awarded, all to members of the Army and the majority for actions during the First World War. The last award to an Australian was made in 1972, arising from the Vietnam War.

;Canada
The medal was first awarded to a Canadian on 19 April 1901. Altogether, there were 2,132 awards to Canadian Army and Royal Canadian Air Force personnel, 38 first Bars and one second Bar.

;New Zealand
Between 1899 and 1970, 525 awards of the Distinguished Conduct Medal were made to New Zealanders.

;South Africa
More than 300 Distinguished Conduct Medals were awarded to South Africans during the two World Wars.

<text>Gemini 11 (officially Gemini XI) was the ninth crewed spaceflight mission of NASA&#x27;s Project Gemini, which flew from September 12 to 15, 1966. It was the 17th crewed American flight and the 25th spaceflight to that time (includes X-15 flights over 100 kilometers (62 mi; 54 nmi)). Astronauts Pete Conrad and Dick Gordon performed the first direct-ascent (first orbit) rendezvous with an Agena Target Vehicle, docking with it 1 hour 34 minutes after launch; used the Agena rocket engine to achieve a record high-apogee Earth orbit; and created a small amount of artificial gravity by spinning the two spacecraft connected by a tether. Gordon also performed two extra-vehicular activities for a total of 2 hours 41 minutes.

==Crew==
===Backup crew===

*Period: 101.52 min

===Docking===
* Docked: September 12, 1966, 16:16:00 UTC
* Undocked: September 14, 1966, 16:55:00 UTC

===Space walk===

**Start: September 13, 1966, 14:44:00 UTC
**End: September 13, 1966, 15:17:00 UTC
**Duration: 33 minutes
* Gordon – EVA 2 (stand up)
**Start: September 14, 1966, 12:49:00 UTC
**End: September 14, 1966, 14:57:00 UTC
**Duration: 2 hours and 8 minutes

==Objectives==
* Perform a direct-ascent rendezvous with the Agena Target Vehicle on the first orbit in support of Project Apollo. This would simulate a Lunar Module rendezvous with the Command/Service Module after a lunar landing.
* Use the Agena rocket engine to put the combined craft in a high-apogee elliptical orbit.
* Perform two extra-vehicular activities.
* Demonstrate passive attitude stabilization of the two spacecraft connected by a tether and create artificial gravity by spinning the combined craft.
* Perform miscellaneous scientific experiments.
* Perform a computer-controlled atmospheric reentry to a precision splashdown point.

==Flight==

The direct-ascent rendezvous and docking with the Agena vehicle was achieved approximately 94 minutes after lift-off, depending on the on-board computer and radar equipment with only minimal assistance from ground support.

Gemini 11 used the rocket on its Agena target vehicle to raise its apogee to , the highest Earth orbit ever reached by a crewed spacecraft at the time. The perigee was , and maximum velocity (at perigee) was . The apogee record stood until the until Polaris Dawn in 2024; men have achieved greater distances from Earth by flying to the Moon in the Apollo program. The maximum operational altitude of the Space Shuttle was much lower, at for the STS-31 flight in 1990. The September 2021 SpaceX flight of Inspiration4, while having an apogee higher than most Space Shuttle flights, only reached .

The crew docked and undocked four times and still had sufficient Gemini maneuvering fuel for an unplanned fifth rendezvous. They did not remain in the high orbit, but changed it back to a near-circular one at .

Gordon&#x27;s first EVA, planned to last for two hours, involved fastening a tether, stored in the Agena&#x27;s docking collar, to the Gemini&#x27;s docking bar for the passive stabilization experiment. Gordon achieved this, but as with previous Gemini EVAs, trying to work for an extended period proved more fatiguing than in ground simulation, and the EVA had to be terminated after only half an hour.

The passive stabilization experiment proved to be troublesome. Conrad and Gordon separated the craft in a nose-down (i.e., Agena-down) position, but found that the tether would not be kept taut simply by the Earth&#x27;s gravity gradient, as expected. They were able to generate a small amount of artificial gravity, about 0.00015 g, by firing their side thrusters to slowly rotate the combined craft like a slow-motion pair of bolas.

Gordon successfully performed a second EVA standing up with his head and shoulders out of the hatch to photograph the Earth, clouds, and stars. This was not tiring and lasted more than two hours.

===Scientific experiments===
The 12 scientific experiments were:
* Mass Determination: To test a technique and accuracy of a direct-contact method of determining the mass of an orbiting object, in this case the Agena Target Vehicle.
* Night Image Intensification: To test the usefulness and performance of a low-light-level television system as a supplement to unaided vision in observing surface features primarily when such features are in darkness and spacecraft pilots are not dark-adapted.
* Power Tool Evaluation: To evaluate man&#x27;s capability to perform work tasks in space, including the comparison of ability to work tethered and untethered, and to evaluate the performance of the minimum-reaction power tool.
* Radiation and Zero G Effects on Blood and Neurospora: To determine whether weightlessness enhances the effects of radiation on human white blood cells and &quot;Neurospora crassa&quot; fungi.
* Synoptic Terrain Photography: To obtain high-quality photographs for research in geology, geophysics, geography, oceanography, and related fields.
* Synoptic Weather Photography: To obtain selective high-quality photographs of clouds to study the fine structure of the Earth&#x27;s weather system.
* Nuclear Emulsion: To study the cosmic radiation incident on the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, to obtain detailed chemical composition of the heavy primary nuclei, and to search for rare particles.
* Airglow Horizon Photography: To measure by direct photography the heights at which atomic oxygen and sodium layers occur in the upper atmosphere.
* Ultraviolet Astronomical Camera: To test the techniques of ultraviolet photography under vacuum conditions and to obtain ultraviolet radiation observations of stars in wavelength region of 2,000 to 4,000 angstroms by spectral means.
* Ion Wake Measurement: To determine and measure the ion and electron wake structure and perturbation of the ambient medium produced by an orbiting vehicle, and to study the changes in the ion flux and wake caused by thruster firings.
* Earth-Moon Libration Region Photography: To investigate the regions of the L4 and L5 libration points of the Earth–Moon system to determine the possible existence of clouds of particulate matter orbiting the Earth in these regions (Kordylewski clouds).
* Dim-Light Photography and Orthicon: To obtain photographs of various faint and diffuse astronomical phenomena.

===Reentry===
The mission ended with the first totally automatic, computer-controlled reentry by the U.S., which brought Gemini 11 down from its recovery ship USS &quot;Guam&quot;, only from the planned position.

Astronaut recovery was done by United States Navy Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron 3.

The Gemini 11 mission was supported by 9,054 United States Department of Defense personnel, 73 aircraft, and 13 ships.

==Insignia==

Since Conrad and Gordon were both members of the US Navy, the embroidered mission patch was designed in Navy colors: blue and gold. Stars are used to mark the major milestones of the mission. The first orbit Agena rendezvous is marked by a small gold star just above the Earth, to the left. The Agena docking is marked by a large star on the left. The star at the top marks the record high apogee reached by Gemini 11. Note that the scale is greatly exaggerated; their maximum altitude of is roughly the distance from St. Louis to Cape Kennedy. Finally, the star on the right marks Dick Gordon&#x27;s spacewalk. The docking, record apogee and spacewalk are also shown on the patch by the Agena, orbital apogee path and spacewalking astronaut.

==Potential lunar missions==

Gemini 11&#x27;s record altitude was ultimately the result of an internal race to the Moon. As early as 1961, NASA&#x27;s Jim Chamberlin and McDonnell Aircraft had advocated using Gemini spacecraft to get to the Moon sooner than Apollo. Their proposals considered using Centaur rockets to boost the Gemini on a circumlunar trajectory (similar to the Soviet&#x27;s Zond program), lunar orbit missions using Centaur rockets for translunar injection and Agena for lunar orbit insertion, and even lunar landing missions using Gemini in place of the Apollo Command Module and a small open-cockpit Langley Light LM in place of the Apollo Lunar Module. Multiple Titan or Saturn IB rockets, and even the abandoned Saturn C-3 were considered as the launch vehicles.

Pete Conrad liked these ideas and together with McDonnell corporations strongly advocated his Gemini 11 to be circumlunar. Discretely called &#x27;Gemini - Large Earth Orbit&#x27;, the plan would use a Titan IIIC-launched Transtage. The Gemini 11 crew would be launched with the Titan II GLV as they did in reality, and would dock with the Transtage, which would then boost them to translunar velocity. Conrad managed to stir Congressional interest, but NASA administrator James Webb informed them that any extra funds Congress cared to appropriate for such a project would be better spent accelerating the Apollo program. After further internal struggles, Conrad finally got NASA approval for the Agena on his Gemini 11 flight to boost him onto two record highly elliptical 1,370 km orbits. This high flight was the only remnant of lunar Gemini.
==Spacecraft location==
The spacecraft is on display at the California Science Center in Los Angeles, California.

<doc id="411597" wikidata="Q1138584" url="?curid=411597" title="Balanitis">
<text>Balanitis is inflammation of the glans penis. Balanoposthitis is the proper term when the foreskin is also affected. Balanitis on boys in diapers must be distinguished from redness caused by ammoniacal dermatitis.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;balanitis&quot; is from the Greek &quot; &quot;, literally meaning &#x27;acorn&#x27; because of the similarity in shape to the glans penis. &quot;-Itis&quot; is a suffix from the Greek for &#x27;inflammation&#x27;. &quot;Posthe&quot; is the Greek word meaning &#x27;foreskin&#x27;.

==Signs and symptoms==
* Small red erosions on the glans (first sign)
* Redness of the foreskin
* Redness of the penis
* Other rashes on the head of the penis
* Foul smelling discharge
* Painful foreskin and penis

===Complications===
Recurrent bouts of balanitis may cause scarring of the preputial orifice; the reduced elasticity may lead to pathologic phimosis. Further complications may include: 
* Stricture of urinary meatus
* Phimosis
* Paraphimosis

==Causes==

Inflammation has many possible causes, including irritation by environmental substances, certain medications, physical trauma, and infection such as bacterial, viral, or fungal. Some of these infections are sexually transmitted, however a yeast infection, &quot;Candida balanitis&quot;, is generally not categorized as such.

It is less common among males who are circumcised; in many cases, a dysfunction of the foreskin is a causal or contributing factor. Both not enough cleaning and too much cleaning can cause problems.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis may include careful identification of the cause with the aid of a good patient history, swabs and cultures, and pathological examination of a biopsy.

=== Types ===
* Zoon&#x27;s balanitis, also known as &quot;Balanitis Circumscripta Plasmacellularis&quot; or &quot;plasma cell balanitis&quot; (PCB), is an idiopathic, rare, benign penile dermatosis for which circumcision is often the preferred treatment. Zoon&#x27;s balanitis has been successfully treated with the carbon dioxide laser; and more recently, Albertini and colleagues report the avoidance of circumcision and successful treatment of Zoon&#x27;s balanitis with an . Another study, by Retamar and colleagues, found that 40 percent of those treated with CO2 laser relapsed.
* Circinate balanitis, also known as balanitis circinata, is a serpiginous annular dermatitis associated with reactive arthritis.
* Pseudoepitheliomatous keratotic and micaceous balanitis

==Treatment==
Initial treatment in adults often involves simply pulling back the foreskin and cleaning the penis. However, some topical antibiotic and fungal ointments may be used for treatment for mild cases. Depending upon severity, hydrocortisone and other steroidal creams may be used upon consultation.

==Epidemiology==
Balanitis &quot;is a common condition affecting 11% of adult men seen in urology clinics and 3% of children&quot; in the United States; globally, balanitis &quot;may occur in up to 3% of uncircumcised males&quot;.

==Other animals==

In dogs, balanoposthitis is caused by a disruption in the integumentary system, such as a wound or intrusion of a foreign body. A dog with this condition behaves normally, with the exception of excessive licking at the prepuce, and a yellow green, pus-like discharge is usually present.

In sheep (rams/wethers), ulcerative enzootic balanoposthitis is caused by the &quot;Corynebacterium renale&quot; group (&quot;C. renale, C. pilosum &amp; C. cystidis&quot;).

For the condition in bulls, caused by a virus see Bovine herpesvirus 1.

Balanoposthitis is believed to have contributed to the decline to near-extinction of the marsupial Gilbert&#x27;s potoroo.

<doc id="411607" wikidata="Q2889191" url="?curid=411607" title="Battle of Magdhaba">
<text>The Battle of Magdhaba took place on 23 December 1916 during the Defence of Egypt section of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign in the First World War. The attack by the Anzac Mounted Division took place against an entrenched Ottoman Army garrison to the south and east of Bir Lahfan in the Sinai desert, some inland from the Mediterranean coast. This Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) victory against the Ottoman Empire garrison also secured the town of El Arish after the Ottoman garrison withdrew.

In August 1916, a combined Ottoman and German Empire army had been forced to retreat to Bir el Abd, after the British victory in the Battle of Romani. During the following three months the defeated force retired further eastwards to El Arish, while the captured territory stretching from the Suez Canal was consolidated and garrisoned by the EEF. Patrols and reconnaissances were carried out by British forces, to protect the continuing construction of the railway and water pipeline and to deny passage across the Sinai desert to the Ottoman forces by destroying water cisterns and wells.

By December 1916, construction of the infrastructure and supply lines had sufficiently progressed to enable the British advance to recommence during the evening of 20 December. By the following morning, a mounted force had reached El Arish to find it abandoned. An Ottoman Army garrison in a strong defensive position was located at Magdhaba, some inland to the south east, on the Wadi al-Arish. After a second night march by the Anzac Mounted Division (Australian and New Zealand Mounted Division), the attack on Magdhaba was launched by Australian, British and New Zealand troops against well-entrenched Ottoman forces defending a series of six redoubts. During the day&#x27;s fierce fighting, the mounted infantry tactics of riding as close to the front line as possible and then dismounting to make their attack with the bayonet supported by artillery and machine guns prevailed, assisted by aircraft reconnaissance. All of the well-camouflaged redoubts were eventually located and captured and the Ottoman defenders surrendered in the late afternoon.

==Background==
At the beginning of the First World War, the Egyptian police who had controlled the Sinai Desert were withdrawn, leaving the area largely unprotected. In February 1915, a German and Ottoman force unsuccessfully attacked the Suez Canal. After the Gallipoli Campaign, a second joint German and Ottoman force again advanced across the desert to threaten the canal, during July 1916. This force was defeated in August at the Battle of Romani, after which the Anzac Mounted Division, also known as the A. &amp; N. Z. Mounted Division, under the command of the Australian major general Harry Chauvel, pushed the Ottoman Army&#x27;s Desert Force commanded by the German general Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein out of Bir el Abd and across the Sinai to El Arish.

By mid-September 1916 the Anzac Mounted Division had pursued the retreating Ottoman and German forces from Bir el Salmana along the northern route across the Sinai Peninsula to the outpost at Bir el Mazar. The Maghara Hills, south west of Romani, in the interior of the Sinai Desert, were also attacked in mid-October by a British force based on the Suez Canal. Although not captured at the time, all these positions were eventually abandoned by their Ottoman garrisons in the face of growing British Empire strength.

===Consolidation of British territorial gains===
The British then established garrisons along their supply lines, which stretched across the Sinai from the Suez Canal. Patrols and reconnaissances were regularly carried out to protect the advance of the railway and water pipeline, built by the Egyptian Labour Corps. These supply lines were marked by railway stations and sidings, airfields, signal installations and standing camps where troops could be accommodated in tents and huts. At this time the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) had a ration strength of 156,000 soldiers, plus 13,000 Egyptian labourers.

===Ottoman positions in the Sinai===
The Ottoman Army&#x27;s Desert Force commanded by Kress von Kressenstein which operated in the Sinai region was sustained and supported by their principal desert base at Hafir El Auja, located on the Ottoman side of the Egyptian-Ottoman frontier. Hafir el Auja was linked to Beersheba, Gaza, and northern Palestine by road and railway.

This major German and Ottoman base in the central Sinai desert, supplied and supported smaller garrisons in the area with reinforcements, ammunition and rations, medical support, and periods of rest away from the front line. If left intact, the Ottoman forces at Magdhaba and Hafir el Auja could seriously threaten the advance of the EEF along the north route towards Southern Palestine.

===Problems with the advance to El Arish===

====Water====

The area of oases which extended from Dueidar, from Kantara along the Darb es Sultani, along the old caravan route, and on to Salmana from Kantara could sustain life. But from Salmana to Bir el Mazar, ( from Kantara) there was little water, and beyond the Mazar area there was no water, until El Arish was reached on the coast from Kantara.

Before the British advance to El Arish could begin, the stretch without a water supply between El Mazar and El Arish had to be resolved. By mid-December 1916, the pipeline&#x27;s eastward progress made it possible to store sufficient water at Maadan and it was also possible to concentrate sufficiently large numbers of Egyptian Camel Transport Corps camels and their drivers to carry water forward from Maadan in support of an attacking force.

====Conditions====
The campaign across the Sinai desert required great determination, as well as conscientious attention to detail by all involved, to ensure that ammunition, rations and every required pint of water and bale of horse fodder was available when needed. While the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s main desert base at Hafir el Auja was more centrally located, the British Empire base was some to the west of El Arish; almost at the limits of their lines of communication. Mounted operations so far from base in such barren country were extremely hazardous and difficult.

For these long-range desert operations, it was necessary for all supplies to be well-organised and suitably packaged for transportation on camels, moving with the column or following closely behind. It was vital that the soldiers were well trained for the conditions. If a soldier became isolated, they might die in the burning desert sun during the day, or bitter cold at night. If a water bottle was accidentally tipped up or leaked, it could mean no water for its owner, for perhaps 24 hours in extreme temperatures.
In these extreme and difficult conditions, mounted troops of the EEF worked to provide protective screens for the construction of the infrastructure, patrolling the newly occupied areas and carrying out ground reconnaissance to augment and verify aerial photographs, used to improve maps of the newly occupied areas.

===British War Office policy===
The British War Office&#x27;s stated policy in October 1916 was to maintain offensive operations on the Western Front, while remaining on the defensive everywhere else. However, the battle of attrition on the Somme, coupled with a change of Britain&#x27;s prime minister, with David Lloyd George succeeding H. H. Asquith on 7 December, destabilised the status quo sufficiently to bring about a policy reversal, making attacks on the Central Powers&#x27; weak points away from the Western Front desirable. The commander of the EEF, General Sir Archibald Murray, was encouraged to seek success on his eastern frontier, but without any reinforcements. He thought that an advance to El Arish was possible, and that such an advance would threaten forces in the southern Ottoman Empire and, if not prevent, at least slow the transfer of German and Ottoman units to other theatres of war from the Levant.

===Creation of Eastern Force and Desert Column===
After the victory at Romani, Murray moved his headquarters back from Ismailia on the canal to Cairo. This move to Cairo was to enable him to be in a more central position to carry out his duties and responsibilities which extended from the Western Frontier Force, waging a continuing campaign against the Senussi in Egypt&#x27;s Western Desert, to the Eastern Force in the Sinai. Another consequence of the victory was that Major General H. A. Lawrence, who had been in command of the Northern Sector of the Suez Canal defences and Romani during the battle, was transferred to the Western Front.

As a consequence of pushing the German and Ottoman forces eastwards away from the canal, during October, Lieutenant General Charles Dobell was appointed to command the newly created Eastern Force. With his headquarters at Kantara, Dobell became responsible for the security of the Suez Canal and the Sinai Peninsula.

Dobell&#x27;s Eastern Force consisted of two infantry divisions, the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division commanded by Major General W. Douglas and the 52nd (Lowland) Division commanded by Major General W. E. B. Smith, as well as the Anzac Mounted Division, a mounted infantry division commanded by Chauvel, the 5th Mounted Brigade commanded by Brigadier General E. A. Wiggin and the Imperial Camel Brigade commanded by Brigadier General Clement Leslie Smith. Murray considered this force to be under strength by at least a division for an advance to Beersheba, but felt he could gain El Arish and form an effective base on the coast, from which further operations eastwards could be supplied.

In October Chauvel was granted six weeks&#x27; leave, and he travelled to Britain on 25 October, returning to duty on 12 December 1916. While he was away Desert Column was formed and on 7 December 1916, five days before Chauvel&#x27;s return, Murray appointed the newly promoted Lieutenant General Sir Phillip Chetwode commander of the column. As a major general, Chetwode had been in command of cavalry on the Western Front, where he was involved in pursuing retreating Germans after the First Battle of the Marne.

On formation, Chetwode&#x27;s Desert Column consisted of three infantry divisions, the 53rd (Welsh) Division, currently serving in the Suez Canal Defences and commanded by A. E. Dallas, and the 42nd (East Lancashire) and the 52nd (Lowland) divisions. Chetwode&#x27;s mounted force consisted of the Anzac Mounted Division, the 5th Mounted Brigade and the Imperial Camel Brigade.

==Prelude==

By early December 1916, construction of the railway had reached the wells at Bir el Mazar, the last water sources available to the EEF before El Arish. Bir el Mazar was about halfway between Kantara on the Suez Canal and the Egyptian-Ottoman territorial border. British intelligence had reported Ottoman Army plans to strengthen the garrison at Magdhaba, by extending the railway (or light rail) south east from Beersheba (and Hafir el Auja) towards Magdhaba.

===Advance to El Arish===
Mounted patrols to the outskirts of El Arish discovered 1,600 well-entrenched Ottoman troops holding the town, supported by forces based to the south-east on the banks of the Wadi el Arish at Magdhaba and Abu Aweigila.

On 20 December, a week after Chauvel returned from leave, the advance to El Arish began when the Anzac Mounted Division left Bir Gympie at 21:45. They moved out without the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, which was in the rear assisting with patrolling the lines of communication stretching back to Kantara on the Suez Canal. So it was the 1st and 3rd Light Horse Brigades, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, the 5th Mounted Brigade and the newly formed battalions of the Imperial Camel Brigade with the mountain guns of the Hong Kong and Singapore Camel Battery which made the trek to El Arish.

On the day they set out, Australian airmen reported that the garrisons at El Arish and Maghara Hills, in the centre of the Sinai, appeared to have been withdrawn.
As the Anzac Mounted Division approached Um Zughla at 02:00 on 21 December, a halt was called until 03:30 when the column continued on to El Arish. At 07:45, the advanced troops entered the town, unopposed, to contact the civil population and arrange water supplies for the mounted force. One prisoner was captured, while lines of observation were set up, which maintained a close watch over the country east and south of the town. By 16:00 the 1st and 3rd Light Horse, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles and the Imperial Camel Brigades were in bivouac at El Arish, the only casualties during the day being two members of the 1st Light Horse Brigade, who were blown up by a stranded mine on the beach.

The day after El Arish was occupied, on 22 December, the leading infantry brigade of the 52nd (Lowland) Division reached the town and, together with the 5th Mounted Brigade, garrisoned the town and began fortifying the area. At 10:00, Chetwode landed on the beach opposite the Anzac Mounted Division Headquarters to begin his appointment as commander of Desert Column. Chetwode reported that he had arranged a special camel convoy with rations and horse feed to arrive at El Arish at 16:30 that day, with a view to the Anzac Mounted Division advancing on Magdhaba, away. (On the following day 23 December, the first supplies to be transported to El Arish by ship from Port Said were landed.) With essential rations organised, Chauvel led the mounted division out of El Arish at 00:45 on the night of 22/23 December towards Magdhaba, after reconnaissances had established that the retreating Ottoman force from El Arish had moved to the south east along the Wadi el Arish towards Magdhaba.

===Ottoman force===
After their retreat from El Arish, the Ottoman garrison withdrew down the Wadi el Arish south east of El Arish, to Magdhaba and Abu Aweigila, about another further away from the coast, on the banks of the wadi. At Magdhaba the garrison had increased from 500 to about 1,400 Ottoman soldiers; there may have been as many as 2,000, consisting of two battalions of the 80th Infantry Regiment (27th Ottoman Infantry Division but attached to the 3rd Ottoman Infantry Division for most of 1916). These two battalions, the 2nd Battalion, commanded by Izzet Bey, of about 600 men and the 3rd Battalion, commanded by Rushti Bey, were supported by a dismounted camel company and two squads from the 80th Machine Gun Company. (The remainder squads of the 80th Machine Gun Company had been moved north to Shellal.) The defending force was also supported by a battery of four Krupp 7.5 cm Gebirgskanone M 1873 guns (on loan from the 1st Mountain Regiment), since the 80th Regiment&#x27;s own artillery battery was stationed at Nekhl. Also attached to the Ottoman garrison at Magdhaba were a number of support units, including elements of the 3rd Company of the 8th Engineer Battalion, 27th Medical Company, 43rd Mobile Hospital and the 46th Cooking Unit. The garrison was under the command of Kadri Bey, the commanding officer of the 80th Infantry Regiment.

The series of six well-situated and developed redoubts making up the strong Ottoman garrison position at Magdhaba reflected considerable planning; the redoubts were almost impossible to locate on the flat ground on both sides of the Wadi el Arish. Clearly, the move of the Ottoman garrison from El Arish had not been a sudden, panicked reaction; indeed it was first noticed by Allied aerial reconnaissance planes as early as 25 October.
These fortified redoubts, which were situated on both sides of the wadi, were linked by a series of trenches. The whole position, extending over an area of about from east to west, was more narrow from north to south. On 22 December 1916, the day before the attack, the garrison had been inspected by Kress von Kressenstein, commander of the Ottoman Desert Force, who drove from his base at Hafir el Auja. At the time he expressed satisfaction with the garrison&#x27;s ability to withstand any assault.

Von Kressenstein&#x27;s satisfaction that the garrison could withstand any assault may have had something to do with its remoteness. Magdhaba was about from the British railhead and from El Arish. There were two other important pieces of information von Kressenstein did not have. Firstly, he would have been unaware of the speed, flexibility and determination of the Australian, British and New Zealand mounted force, which they were about to demonstrate. Secondly, the arrival of the new British commander, Chetwode, and his staff and their vital forward planning to organise the necessary logistical support for an immediate long range attack by the Anzac Mounted Division.

===British Empire force===
Chauvel&#x27;s force for the attack on Magdhaba consisted of three brigades of the Anzac Mounted Division; 1st Light Horse Brigade (1st, 2nd and 3rd Light Horse Regiments), the 3rd Light Horse Brigade (8th, 9th and 10th Light Horse Regiments), the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade (Auckland, Canterbury and Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiments), together with three battalions from the Imperial Camel Brigade in place of the 2nd Light Horse Brigade. These nine regiments and three battalions were supported by the Inverness and Somerset Artillery Batteries, Royal Horse Artillery, and the Hong Kong and Singapore Artillery Battery.
This force, which may have been 7,000 strong, moved out from El Arish just after midnight, following an unexpected delay caused by incoming infantry columns of the 52nd (Lowland) Division, which crossed the long camel train carrying water which followed the mounted division. Nevertheless, the Anzac Mounted Division (riding for forty minutes, dismounting and leading their horse for ten minutes and halting for ten minutes every hour) reached the plain from Magdhaba, at about 05:00 on 23 December. The column had been successfully guided by brigade scouts, until the garrison&#x27;s fires had become visible for about an hour during their trek, indicating the Ottomans did not expect an attacking force to set out on a second night march, after their ride to El Arish.

====Aerial support====
Aerial reconnaissances were routinely carried out; one carried out on 15 November by the Australian Flying Corps made a detailed reconnaissance behind enemy lines over the areas of El Kossaima, Hafir el Auja and Abu Aweigila, taking 24 photographs of all camps and dumps.

The Royal Flying Corps&#x27;s 5th Wing under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel P B Joubert de la Ferté stationed at Mustabig supported the Anzac Mounted Division. The Wing was a composite formation of the No. 14 Squadron and the Australian Flying Corps&#x27;s No. 1 Squadron. It was ordered to provide close air support, long-range scouting and long-range bombing. One British and ten Australian planes had dropped a hundred bombs on Magdhaba on 22 December and during the battle bombed and machine gunned the area, but targets were difficult to find.

====Medical support====
The evacuation of wounded had been reviewed following the problems encountered during the Battle of Romani, with particular attention given to the development of transport by railway. By the time the advance to El Arish occurred in December 1916, two additional hospital trains were available on the Sinai railway, and medical sections had been deployed at the following:
:close to the battlefield at railhead, where the immobile sections of divisional field ambulances could accommodation 700 casualties,
:at Bir el Abd No. 24 Casualty Clearing Station (CCS), which could accommodate 400 cases, and Nos. 53 and 54 CCS could each accommodate 200,
:at Bir el Mazar No. 26 CCS, which could accommodate 400 cases,
:at Mahamdiyah No. 2 (Australian) Stationary Hospital with 800 beds,
:at Kantara East No. 24 Stationary Hospital with 800 beds.

==Battle==
At 06:30 the No. 5 Wing attacked the Ottoman defences, drawing some fire which revealed the locations of machine guns, trenches and five redoubts. The redoubts were arranged around the village, which protected the only available water supply in the area. During the day, pilots and their observers provided frequent reports; fourteen were received between 07:50 and 15:15, giving estimated positions, strength, and movements of the Ottoman garrison. These were most often given verbally by the observer, after the pilot landed near Chauvel&#x27;s headquarters, as the aircraft did not at this time have wireless communication.

The main attack, from the north and east, was to be made by the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, commanded by Brigadier General Edward Chaytor, which moved in line of troop columns. The New Zealanders were supported by a machine gun squadron armed with Vickers and Lewis guns, and the 3rd Light Horse Brigade all under the command of Chaytor. This attack began near the village of Magdhaba and the Wadi El Arish, on the virtually featureless battleground, when the British Empire artillery opened fire at the same time as Chaytor&#x27;s group moved towards the Ottoman garrison&#x27;s right and rear.

Chauvel&#x27;s plan of envelopment quickly began to develop. Despite heavy Ottoman fire, Chaytor&#x27;s attacking mounted troops found cover and dismounted, some about from the redoubts and entrenchments, while others got as close as . At the same time, units of the Imperial Camel Brigade were moving straight on Magdhaba, in a south easterly direction, following the telegraph line, and by 08:45 were slowly advancing on foot, followed by the 1st Light Horse Brigade, in reserve.
Chauvel&#x27;s envelopment was extended at 09:25, when Chaytor ordered a regiment to circle the entrenched positions and move through Aulad Ali, to cut off a possible line of retreat to the south and south east. The 10th Light Horse Regiment with two sections of the brigade Machine Gun Squadron, led by Brigadier General J. R. Royston, commander of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, succeeded in capturing Aulad Ali and 300 prisoners.

The Ottoman artillery batteries and trenches were difficult to locate, but by 10:00 the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade was advancing towards the firing line. At this time, an aerial report described small groups of the Magdhaba garrison beginning to retreat, and as a result the still-mounted reserve, the 1st Light Horse Brigade, was ordered to move directly on the town, passing the dismounted Imperial Camel Brigade battalions on their way. After meeting severe shrapnel fire as they trotted over the open plain, they were forced to take cover in the Wadi el Arish where they dismounted, continuing their advance at 10:30 against the Ottoman left. Meanwhile, the battalions of the Imperial Camel Brigade, continued their advance over the flat ground for , section by section, covering fire provided by each section in turn.

By 12:00 all brigades were hotly engaged, as the 3rd Light Horse Brigade&#x27;s 10th Light Horse Regiment continued their sweep round the garrison&#x27;s right flank. An hour later, the right of the Imperial Camel Brigade battalions had advanced to reach the 1st Light Horse Brigade and 55 minutes afterwards, fierce fighting was beginning to make an impact on the Ottoman garrison. Reports continued of small numbers of Ottoman troops retreating, but by 14:15 the 10th Light Horse Regiment was continuing its trek after capturing Aulad Ali; moving across the Wadi el Arish, round Hill 345 to attack the rear of Redoubt No. 4. By 14:55 the frontal attack by the Imperial Camel Brigade was within of the Ottoman defences and, together with the 1st Light Horse Brigade, at 15:20, they attacked No. 2 redoubt. Ten minutes later the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, with fixed bayonets, attacked the trenches to the east of some houses and the 10th Light Horse Regiment, by now advancing from the south, captured two trenches on that side, effectively cutting off any retreat for the Ottoman garrison.
By 16:00 the 1st Light Horse Brigade had captured No. 2 redoubt, and Chaytor reported capturing buildings and redoubts on the left. After a telephone call between Chauvel and Chetwode, pressure continued to be exerted and an attack by all units took place at 16:30. The Ottoman garrison held on until the dismounted attackers were within , but by that time, there was no doubt that the Ottoman garrison was losing the fight, and they began to surrender in small groups. All organised resistance ceased ten minutes later and as darkness fell, sporadic firing petered out, while prisoners were rounded up, horses collected and watered at the captured wells. Then Chauvel rode into Magdhaba and gave the order to clear the battlefield.

At 23:30 the Anzac Mounted Division&#x27;s headquarters left Magdhaba with an escort and arrived in El Arish at 04:10 on 24 December 1916.

===Casualties and captures===
Of the 146 known British Empire casualties, 22 were killed and 124 were wounded. Five officers were killed and seven wounded, and 17 other ranks were killed and 117 wounded. Included in the 146 figure, which may have been as high as 163, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade suffered the loss of two officers and seven other ranks killed and 36 other ranks wounded.

No more than 200 Ottoman soldiers escaped before the surviving garrison of between 1,242 and 1,282 men were captured. The prisoners included the 80th Regiment&#x27;s commander Khadir Bey, and the 2nd and 3rd Battalions commanders, Izzat Bey, Rushti Bey among 43 officers. Over 300 Ottoman soldiers were killed; 97 were buried on the battlefield, and 40 wounded were cared for.

==Aftermath==

With the victory at Magdhaba the occupation of El Arish was secure. This was the first town captured on the Mediterranean coast and infantry from the 52nd (Lowland) Division and the 5th Mounted Yeomanry Brigade quickly began to fortify the town. The Royal Navy arrived on 22 December 1916, and supplies began landing on the beaches near El Arish on 24 December. After the arrival of the railway on 4 January 1917 followed by the water pipeline, El Arish quickly developed into a major base for the EEF.

Aerial reconnaissance found Ottoman forces moving their headquarters north from Beersheba, while the garrison at their main desert base of Hafir El Auja was slightly increased. Other Ottoman outposts at El Kossaima and Nekhl remained, along with their strong defensive system of trenches and redoubts at El Magruntein defending Rafa on the frontier between Egypt and the southern Ottoman Empire.

===Return to El Arish===
Chauvel&#x27;s force had left El Arish the previous night, carrying one water bottle per man. Additional water was organised by Desert Column staff and sent from El Arish to Lahfan, and a water convoy from Lahfan, ordered to move to Magdhaba at 15:10 on the day of battle, was reported to be on its way at 15:20.

After filling up from the water convoy after its arrival at Magdhaba, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles and 3rd Light Horse Brigades left to ride back to El Arish in their own time.

Material assistance was given to the returning columns by the 52nd (Lowland) Division, in form of the loan of camels, water fantasses, sandcarts and gun horse teams, the latter going out on the commanding generals&#x27; initiative to meet the returning teams.

===Clearing the battleground===
At a dressing station set up west of Magdhaba, by the New Zealand Field Ambulance Mobile Section and the 1st Light Horse Field Ambulance, 80 wounded were treated during the day of battle. Field ambulances performed urgent surgery, gave tetanus inoculations, and fed patients. On the night after the battle, treated wounded were evacuated in sandcarts and on torturous cacolets to El Arish, with the No. 1 Ambulance Convoy assisting.

Part of the 1st Light Horse Regiment, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel C. H. Granville, with two squadrons of the Auckland Mounted Rifle Regiment plus one squadron from the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, bivouacked for the night at Magdhaba. A convoy of supplies was ordered from El Arish to support these troops, who continued clearing the battlefield the following morning. The remaining 44 British Empire and 66 Ottoman Empire wounded, collected on 23 and 24 December, were taken to an Ottoman hospital within the Magdhaba fortifications, before being sent to the dressing station. From there, at 17:00 the ambulance convoy set out on its march to the receiving station.

The convoys of wounded were met a few miles from El Arish by infantry with sandcarts lent by the 52nd (Lowland) Division, so the wounded who had endured the cacolets travelled in comfort to the receiving station, arriving at 04:00 on 25 December. The 52nd (Lowland) Division supplied medical stores and personnel to assist, but although arrangements were made for evacuation to the railhead two days later, evacuation by sea was planned. This had to be postponed due to a gale with rain and hail on 27 December and it was not until 29 December that the largest single ambulance convoy organised in the campaign, 77 sandcarts, nine sledges and a number of cacolet camels, moved out in three lines along the beach with 150 wounded. A few serious cases, who had not been ready to be moved, were evacuated the following day to begin their journey to Kantara on the Suez Canal.

===Recognition===
In an address to the troops after the battle, Chetwode expressed his appreciation for the mounted rifle and light horse method of attack. He said that in the history of warfare he had never known cavalry to not only locate and surround the opponent&#x27;s position, but to dismount and fight as infantry with rifle and bayonet.

On 28 September 1917 Chauvel, who by this time had been promoted by Allenby to command three mounted divisions in Desert Mounted Corps, wrote to General Headquarters:

<text>Comstock is an unincorporated community located in Val Verde County, Texas, United States, approximately 20 miles northwest of Del Rio on U.S. 90. It is the town nearest to Seminole Canyon, which has been a site of human habitation for 9,000 years. In 2010, Comstock had a population of 475 residents.

==History==
Comstock was founded &quot;circa&quot; 1883 on the Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railway as the line drove west toward El Paso. Although first platted as Sotol City, it was later named for John Comstock, a railroad dispatcher.

The town was located near a natural lake, which was used for the town&#x27;s water supply, but which today is only intermittent. The town was granted a post office in 1888, but its remote location and limited resources kept the town from growing quickly. Comstock was at the height of its activity between 1888 and 1910, when the Deaton Stage Line operated between the town&#x27;s railroad depot and the city of Ozona, some 60 mi (100 km) north. The depot at Comstock did not long outlast the stagecoach line, and although the names on the businesses have changed, little has changed in the town in 70 years. 

Amtrak’s Sunset Limited passes through the town on Union Pacific tracks, but makes no stop. A stop is located 30 miles to the south in Del Rio.

==Seminole Canyon State Park and Historic Site==
Seminole Canyon State Park and Historic Site has cave drawings and other evidence of settlement dating from the early Archaic period, around 7000 BC. Later remains include stone circles and cairns of the late Prehistoric, and even 19th-century remains from the construction of the Southern Pacific, one of the nation&#x27;s first transcontinental railroads.

==Education==
Comstock is served by the Comstock Independent School District.

The whole county is served by Southwest Texas Junior College according to the Texas Education Code.

<text>Gemini 12 (officially Gemini XII) was a 1966 crewed spaceflight in NASA&#x27;s Project Gemini. It was the 10th and final crewed Gemini flight (Gemini 1 and Gemini 2 were uncrewed missions), the 18th crewed American spaceflight, and the 26th spaceflight of all time, including X-15 flights over . Commanded by Gemini VII veteran James A. Lovell, the flight featured three periods of extravehicular activity (EVA) by rookie Edwin &quot;Buzz&quot; Aldrin, lasting a total of 5 hours and 30 minutes. It also achieved the fifth rendezvous and fourth docking with an Agena target vehicle.

Gemini XII marked a successful conclusion of the Gemini program, achieving the last of its goals by successfully demonstrating that astronauts can effectively work outside of spacecraft. This was instrumental in paving the way for the Apollo program to achieve its goal of landing a man on the Moon by the end of the 1960s.

==Launch==

Liftoff of the Atlas/Agena Target Vehicle occurred at 2:07:59 PM EST, and of the Gemini/Titan spacecraft at 3:46:33 PM EST, on November 11. This holds the record for the quickest turnaround between two orbital launches from the United States, at one hour and 39 minutes. All launch vehicle systems performed nominally during powered flight, but at staging, there was a recurrence of the first stage oxidizer tank rupture first seen on Gemini 10&#x27;s launch. On Gemini 12, the fuel tank appeared to have also ruptured as a white cloud was seen emitting from the spent stage along with the orange nitrogen tetroxide. Another episode of &quot;Green Man&quot; also occurred at SECO, referring to pitch gyrations caused by pressure buildup in the second stage protective skirt.

==Objectives==
At the completion of the previous Gemini flight, the program still had not demonstrated that an astronaut could work easily and efficiently outside the spacecraft. Prior to the Gemini XII mission, other astronauts from previous missions of the Gemini Program had attempted EVAs. However, their successes were limited due to a lack of proper restraints and insufficient techniques. In preparation for Gemini XII new, improved restraints were added to the outside of the capsule, and a new technique—underwater training—was introduced, which would become a staple of future space-walk simulation. The main purpose of the Gemini XII mission was to find and test new ways to work outside of a spacecraft safely and effectively. Aldrin&#x27;s two-hour, 20-minute tethered space-walk, during which he photographed star fields, retrieved a micrometeorite collector and did other chores, at last demonstrated the feasibility of extravehicular activity. Two more stand-up EVAs also went smoothly, as did the by-now routine rendezvous and docking with an Agena which was done &quot;manually&quot; using the onboard computer and charts when a rendezvous radar failed. The climb to a higher orbit, however, was canceled because of a problem with the Agena booster.

During orbital injection, the GATV engine experienced a drop in turbopump speed lasting about 2.5 seconds. After this, pump performance returned to normal. Telemetry data indicated erratic pump speeds, but engine performance did not reflect this. The anomaly was later found as a brief 30 psi drop in the thrust chamber of the rocket. The mission had planned for an orbital maneuver into a higher orbit but the drop in pressure raised some concerns. Ground controllers decided not to risk the planned orbital boost maneuver since the exact reason for the pump slowdown was unclear. Following Gemini 12&#x27;s reentry and during the GATV&#x27;s 63rd orbit, they attempted to fire the propulsion system, but a stuck fuel valve prevented engine start from occurring.

It was suspected that a turbopump bearing failure caused the anomalous conditions during orbital injection, followed by heating and melting of pump components. The inability of ground controllers to start the engine during the 63rd orbit was possibly due to melted or loose debris blocking the fuel valve and preventing its operation. The telemetry data falsely reporting erratic pump speed was concluded to be debris being knocked around and affecting the data probes.

The 1994 book and documentary &quot;Moon Shot&quot;, as well as the 2008 documentary &quot;When We Left Earth: The NASA Missions&quot;, credits the spacewalk innovations, including the underwater training, to Aldrin himself. However, the 2016 article &quot;Inventing Underwater Training for Walking in Space,&quot; by Michael Neufeld reveals that neutral buoyancy experimentation began at aerospace companies and at NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia a few years before the first Gemini mission had even flown.

Gemini 12 was designed to perform rendezvous and docking with the Agena target vehicle, to conduct three extra-vehicular activity (EVA) operations, to conduct a tethered stationkeeping exercise, to perform docked maneuvers using the Agena propulsion system to change orbit, and demonstrate an automatic reentry.

When Gemini 12 was being planned, one of the possibilities raised was the potential for the flight to be run in conjunction with the first Apollo mission, which had been tentatively scheduled for the last quarter of 1966. By May 1966, delays in making Apollo ready for flight just by itself, and the extra time needed to incorporate compatibility with the Gemini, made that impractical. This became moot when slippage in readiness of the Apollo spacecraft caused the last-quarter 1966 target date to be missed, and the Apollo mission was rescheduled for February 21, 1967. 
===Experiments===

The 14 scientific experiments were (1) frog egg growth under zero-g, (2) synoptic terrain photography, (3) synoptic weather photography, (4) nuclear emulsions, (5) airglow horizon photography, (6) UV astronomical photography, and (7) dim sky photography. Two micrometeorite collection experiments, as well as three space phenomena photography experiments, were not fully completed.

===Reentry===
The capsule was controlled on reentry by computer and splashed down 4.8 kilometers from its target. The crew were taken aboard the aircraft carrier .

The Gemini 12 mission was supported by the following U.S. Department of Defense resources; 9,775 personnel, 65 aircraft and 12 ships.

Postflight medical examination disclosed no unusual conditions in either astronaut. Both were slightly exhausted and dehydrated due to problems with the spacecraft&#x27;s water supply system forcing them to reduce their fluid intake on the last day of the mission and Lovell had a mild case of pinkeye.

==Insignia==

The patch&#x27;s unique orange and black colors are a link to the flight&#x27;s original scheduled date close to Halloween. The Roman numeral XII is located at the 12 o&#x27;clock position on the face of a clock, with the Gemini spacecraft pointing to it like the hour hand of a clock. This represents the position of Gemini 12 as the last flight of the Gemini program. With the Apollo project following this last flight of the Gemini program, the ultimate objective—the Moon—is symbolized by the crescent on the left.

==Spacecraft location==

After several years at the Museum of Transport and Technology, in Auckland, New Zealand, the spacecraft was returned to the United States. It is now on display at the Adler Planetarium, Chicago, Illinois. Lovell and Aldrin were reunited with the spacecraft on November 9, 2006 during the opening for Adler&#x27;s &quot;Shoot for the Moon&quot; exhibit, almost 40 years after the mission launched.

<text>Bad Gandersheim (Eastphalian: &quot;Ganderssen&quot;) is a town in southern Lower Saxony, Germany, located in the district of Northeim. , it had a population of 9,492.

Bad Gandersheim has many half-timbered houses and is located on the German Timber-Frame Road (). The town contains an airport as well.

== Geography ==
The town of Bad Gandersheim lies between the Leine Uplands, Weser Uplands, and Harz Foreland in the valley of the Gande River, into which its tributary, the Eterna, empties within the town&#x27;s territory. To the north lies the Heber Ridge. The borough is predominantly hilly. The Harz Mountains begin about east of the town, and to the west is the Leine Graben ().

=== Borough divisions ===
The borough of Bad Gandersheim consists of the following subdivisions based on the surrounding villages:
==History==
The town dates back to 852, when Gandersheim Abbey, a house of secular canonesses, was created in nearby Brunshausen by Liudolf, Duke of Saxony and his wife Oda. The first abbey church () in the town proper was begun in 856. In 990 the abbey received the market and tax rights. During the 10th century, Gandersheim was one of the most important towns of Saxony; the first German poet Hrosvit (Roswitha) lived and worked here until 973. In 1159 Gandersheim was first mentioned as a town.

When a mineral spring was discovered in 1240, Pope Gregory IX initiated the erection of the Holy Spirit hospital. Around 1330, the Dukes of Brunswick built a castle as a secular counterbalance to the abbey church. This building serves today as the magistrates&#x27; court and youth correctional facility.

In the late 19th century, the town began to become known for the curative powers of its mineral springs, and in 1932 Gandersheim received the official right to call itself a spa town, thus &quot;Bad&quot; Gandersheim, on account of these springs.

In the summer of 1926 there was a three-day &quot;Roswitha Memorial Celebration in 1000-year old Gandersheim&quot;. This was the first time the medieval author was used as a symbolic figure for the town. Similar celebrations took place in 1930 and 1933; these had clear national-socialist themes: &quot;German Culture&quot; versus &quot;Jewish-Communist Decadence.&quot;

During World War 2, from October 1944 to April 1945, the town was the site of a subcamp of the Buchenwald Concentration Camp that produced aircraft parts.

In 1952, the town celebrated the 1100-year jubilee of the founding of the monastery by Liudolf. A history play, &quot;The Song of Gandersheim,&quot; was presented in the market square. This was the unofficial prelude to the summer festival &quot;Gandersheimer Domfestspiele&quot;, which has been presented yearly on the plaza in front of the abbey church since 1959. Since this time, it has established itself as Lower Saxony&#x27;s largest professional summer theatre festival. In 2006, its four major productions were attended by approximately 55,000 theatre visitors.

In 2004, Klaus Weineck established Weineck Engineering, which produced the Weineck Cobra from 2006-2011. The engineering firm, produced 15 cars before going bankrupt do to lack of orders for the car.

<text>The Karelides are an ancient mountain chain located between Eastern Finland and Lapland. It forms the current hill zone of Eastern Finland and Lapland&#x27;s arctic hills, splitting central Finland. The Karelides formed about two billion years ago, when thick sandstone formations were tilted and folded during an orogeny involving a collision of continental plates. Subsequent erosion has left a ridge of resistant quartzite, which has stood there for millions of years. The Karelides were once around 4km high but have been all but eroded to the point where only a peneplain remains.

The mountains in the north-west corner of Finnish Lapland belong to the more recent Scandinavian Mountains and are higher than other Finnish mountains. The third mountain group is the Svecofennides, which run from Southern Finland to Sweden.</text><links>

<text>David Francis Cargo (January 13, 1929 – July 5, 2013) was an American attorney and politician who served as the 22nd governor of New Mexico between 1967 and 1971.

== Early life and education ==
Cargo was born in Dowagiac, Michigan, the eldest of three children of Francis and Mary Harton Cargo. He received a Bachelor of Arts (1951), Master of Arts (1953), and in 1957, a L.L.B., all from the University of Michigan.

== Career ==

He represented the Albuquerque area in the New Mexico House of Representatives from 1963 to 1967, when he was elected governor at the age of thirty-seven. As a representative he won one of the first lawsuits forcing proportional representation in the state legislature. He remains one of the youngest governors elected to date in U.S. history, along with Harold Stassen in Minnesota (1938), Bill Clinton in Arkansas (1978), Christopher &quot;Kit&quot; Bond and Matt Blunt in Missouri (1972) and (2004), respectively, and Bobby Jindal in Louisiana (2007).

Cargo ran for Governor in 1966, facing Clifford J. Hawley of Santa Fe in the Republican primary. In 1966, Cargo won with 17,836 (51.8 percent) to Hawley&#x27;s 16,588 (48.2 percent). He improved his primary performance in 1968, when he defeated Hawley, 28,014 (54.9 percent) to 23,052 (45.1 percent).

Cargo won the general election of 1966, narrowly defeating Democrat Gene Lusk. Cargo received 134,625 votes (51.7 percent) to Lusk&#x27;s 125,587 (48.3 percent). Running again in 1968, Cargo won by an even smaller margin, 160,140 (50.5 percent) to Democrat Fabian Chavez Jr.,&#x27;s 157,230 ballots (49.5 percent).

As governor, Cargo established the state film commission, which brought millions of dollars in revenue to the state of New Mexico. Cargo established ties to Hollywood and was even asked to appear in several films. In 1971, he made a cameo appearance in &quot;Bunny O&#x27;Hare&quot;, starring Bette Davis and Ernest Borgnine, as well as in &quot;Up in the Cellar&quot; (1970), starring Larry Hagman and Joan Collins. During his first campaign for governor, he was known as &quot;Lonesome Dave.&quot;

On May 8, 1970, Cargo sent National Guard troops to the UNM campus when Jane Fonda spoke to an estimated 700 protesters. Gathered to protest the Vietnam War and the Kent State massacre that had happened just four days earlier, the National Guard was given orders to end the protest and bayonetted 11 people, including students who were not part of the protest. A class action lawsuit was brought against Cargo and individual guardsmen by six of the bayonetting victims. A jury in Albuquerque eventually sided with Cargo, the National Guard, and the other politicians involved leaving victims to pay their own medical bills.

Cargo could not seek a third two-year term in 1970 due to term limits. Cargo ran for the U.S. Senate in 1970, but he lost the Republican primary to Anderson &quot;Andy&quot; Carter. Carter polled 32,122 (57.8 percent) to Cargo&#x27;s 17,951 (32.3 percent). Andy Carter then lost the general election to incumbent Democrat Joseph Montoya. Cargo ran unsuccessfully for New Mexico&#x27;s other Senate seat in 1972 but again lost the primary, this time to the eventual winner, Pete Domenici.

From 1973 to 1985, Cargo lived in Lake Oswego, Oregon, and ran unsuccessfully for Oregon State Treasurer in 1984, placing third in the Republican primary won by appointed incumbent Bill Rutherford.

After returning to New Mexico, Cargo won the Republican nomination for Congress in 1986 for New Mexico&#x27;s 3rd congressional district but was defeated by the incumbent, Democrat Bill Richardson. Cargo ran for mayor of Albuquerque in 1989 but placed third, and thus did not advance to the top-two runoff. In 1993 he ran again but lost to Martin Chávez. He tried for a gubernatorial comeback in 1994 but finished in fourth place with 13 percent in the primary and lost to the eventual winner, Gary Johnson. Cargo made his final race in 1997 when he again contested the Albuquerque mayoralty, but he finished third and lost to Jim Baca.

Cargo continued to practice law in Albuquerque. In 2010, he wrote an autobiography titled &quot;Lonesome Dave&quot;.

The Library for the Luna Community College site in Mora, NM is named after David Cargo.

== Personal life ==
Cargo and his wife, Ida Jo, had five children: Veronica, David, Patrick, Elena and Eamon.

Cargo died at the age of eighty-four of complications of a stroke which he had two years earlier.

<doc id="411625" wikidata="Q2741119" url="?curid=411625" title="Powelliphanta">
<text>Powelliphanta is a genus of large, air-breathing land snails, pulmonate gastropods in the family Rhytididae, found only in New Zealand. They are carnivorous, eating invertebrates, mostly native earthworms. Often restricted to very small areas of moist forest, they are prey to introduced mammalian predators, and many species are threatened or endangered.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Powelliphanta&quot; was originally described by A. C. O&#x27;Connor in 1945 as a subgenus of the kauri snails, &quot;Paryphanta.&quot; They were named &quot;in recognition of the great service rendered to the study of the family by Mr A. W. B. Powell&quot;, and from their similarity to &quot;Paryphanta&quot;.


In 1977 Climo raised &quot;Powelliphanta&quot; to genus rank, retaining just two species in &quot;Paryphanta&quot;. There are at least 21 species and 51 subspecies within the genus. The relationship between the species is complex, and it has been suggested that the group &quot;Powelliphanta gilliesi-traversi-hochstetteri-rossiana-lignaria-superba&quot; forms a ring species.

==Distribution==
Powelliphanta are endemic to New Zealand, ranging in the North Island from Lake Waikaremoana to the Kāpiti Coast, and in the South Island from the Marlborough Sounds to Fiordland and Southland. Their greatest diversity is in the mountains of northwest Nelson and north Westland. Some species have an extremely restricted distribution, such as &quot;Powelliphanta gilliesi brunnea&quot;, which is only found in a remnant of coastal forest.

==Habitat==
These snails live mostly in moist native forest. Some live in lowland forest, such as &quot;P. traversi traversi&quot;, which is nationally endangered and has its own 10 ha reserve of kahikatea forest and raupo swamp near Levin. Other species live in upland forest, or even under tussock grasses above the treeline. Several species only inhabit forests on limestone soils; they require calcium to build their shells and eggs, and this is obtained from eating invertebrates (including other snails) which have taken up calcium from the limestone environment. &quot;Powelliphanta&quot; require a moist environment because, unlike other land snails, they cannot seal off their shells with a protective mucous membrane.

==Description==

The largest species, &quot;Powelliphanta superba prouseorum,&quot; has a shell up to across and can weigh . The striking delicately patterned shells of &quot;Powelliphanta&quot; come in an array of shades, from brown or red to yellow or black. The structure of these shells is very delicate, with a very thin layer of calcium carbonate, covered by a thicker chitinous outer layer. These snails need moist surroundings, otherwise the outer layer (periostracum) dries, shrinks and cracks; this sometimes happens in museum shells of this genus which have been stored dry.

==Life habits==
&quot;Powelliphanta&quot; are carnivorous, eating mostly earthworms or slugs. They are nocturnal, and during the day live buried under leaf litter and logs. &quot;Powelliphanta&quot; uses a rudimentary radula to devour their prey: a tongue-like belt of teeth, which scrapes chunks of flesh into the oesophagus. Far from being swallowed whole, prey are subjected to prolonged radulation.

&quot;Powelliphanta&quot; can live for 20 years or more, and are slow to mature, reaching sexual maturity around 5–6 years of age. They are hermaphrodites, having both male and female sex organs. They lay 5 to 10 large (bean-sized) eggs a year, which have a thin pink calcium carbonate shell, like a tiny bird&#x27;s egg. Eggs take 2–6 months to hatch in lowland species, 12–14 months for high-altitude species.

==Fossil record==
Originating more than 235 million years on the supercontinent Gondwana, these snails have been isolated in New Zealand since it separated from Australia about 80 million years ago, and have evolved into numerous distinct species.

==Conservation status==

Most of these snails are under serious threat or even in danger of extinction. Their main natural predator is the weka, but they have no defences against introduced mammalian predators, such as brushtail possums (&quot;Trichosurus vulpecula&quot;), pigs, hedgehogs, and rats. Possums have been shown to eat up to 60 snails in one night. Habitat modification and trampling by introduced animals like goats, deer, and cows is also a threat.

Controlling predatory mammals is now critical to the survival of &quot;Powelliphanta&quot;, and many recovery plans are being undertaken by the Department of Conservation. After aerial application of 1080 poison, &quot;P. &quot;Anatoki Range&quot;&quot; numbers increased threefold at sites in Kahurangi National Park, with large numbers of juveniles present. Prior to applying 1080, there were 54 snails found on a 500 sq grid. One year after the 1080 drop, 147 snails were found on the same plot. Between 1994 and 2010, a series of three aerial 1080 operations over 3430 ha of the Ruahine Forest Park resulted in significant increases in &quot;Powelliphanta marchanti&quot;.
The subspecies &quot;Powelliphanta gilliesi brunnea&quot; and &quot;Powelliphanta traversi otakia&quot; are the most threatened. The IUCN Red List states for &quot;Powelliphanta marchantii&quot; a lower risk, near threatened.

It is illegal since 1982 to collect shells of &quot;Powelliphanta&quot;; collecting live animals for their shells may have made some species rarer, but some species also need to feed on discarded shells to recycle their calcium lining.

==Species==
Species within the genus &quot;Powelliphanta&quot; include:
==Cultural relevance==
A &quot;Powelliphanta&quot; illustrated by Dave Gunson appeared on a New Zealand 40-cent postage stamp, issued October 1997.

<text>Lieutenant junior grade is a junior commissioned officer rank used in a number of navies.

==United States==
Lieutenant (junior grade), commonly abbreviated as LTJG or, historically, Lt. (j.g.) (as well as variants of both abbreviations), is a junior commissioned officer rank of the United States Navy, the United States Coast Guard, the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps (NOAA Corps). LTJG has a US military pay grade of O-2, and a NATO rank code of OF-1. The rank is also used in the United States Maritime Service. The NOAA Corps&#x27;s predecessors, the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps (1917–1965) and the Environmental Science Services Administration Corps or ESSA Corps (1965–1970), also used the rank.

Lieutenant (junior grade) ranks above ensign and below lieutenant and is equivalent to a first lieutenant in the other uniformed services (the Army, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Space Force) and sub-lieutenant in the Royal Navy and the navies of many Commonwealth countries.

Promotion to LTJG is governed by Department of Defense policies derived from the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act of 1980. DOPMA guidelines suggest all &quot;fully qualified&quot; ensigns should be promoted to LTJG. The time for promotion to LTJG is a minimum of two years after commissioning in the Navy or 18 months in the Coast Guard. Lieutenants, junior grade typically lead petty officers and non-rated personnel, unless assigned to small aircraft or on staff duty. A LTJG&#x27;s usual shipboard billet is as a division officer.

<text>Marc Gabriel Charles Gleyre (2 May 1806 – 5 May 1874), was a Swiss artist who was a resident in France from an early age. He took over the studio of Paul Delaroche in 1843 and taught a number of younger artists who became prominent, including Henry-Lionel Brioux, Jean-Léon Gérôme, George du Maurier, Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Louis-Frédéric Schützenberger, Alfred Sisley, Auguste Toulmouche, and James McNeill Whistler.

==Life==
Gleyre was born in Chevilly, near Lausanne. His parents died when he was eight or nine years old, and he was brought up by an uncle in Lyon, France, who sent him to the city&#x27;s industrial school. He began his formal artistic education in Lyon under Bonnefond, before moving to Paris, where he enrolled at the École des Beaux-Arts under Hersent. He also attended the Académie Suisse and studied watercolour technique in the studio of Richard Parkes Bonington. He then went to Italy, where he became acquainted with Horace Vernet and Louis Léopold Robert. 

It was through Vernet&#x27;s recommendation that he was chosen by the American traveller John Lowell Jr. to accompany him on his journeys round the eastern Mediterranean, recording the scenes and ethnographic subjects they met with. They left Italy in spring 1834 and visited Greece, Turkey and Egypt, where they remained together until November 1835, when Lowell left for India. Gleyre continued his travels around Egypt and Syria, not returning to France until 1838. He returned to Lyons in shattered health, having been attacked with ophthalmia, or inflammation of the eye, in Cairo, and struck down by fever in Lebanon.

On his recovery he proceeded to Paris and, establishing a modest studio in the rue de Université, began carefully to work out the ideas which had been slowly shaping themselves in his mind. Mention is made of two decorative panels &quot;Diana leaving the Bath&quot;, and a &quot;Young Nubian&quot; as almost the first fruits of his genius; but these did not attract public attention until much later, and the painting by which he practically opened his artistic career was the &quot;Apocalyptic Vision of St John&quot;, sent to the Salon of 1840. This was followed in 1843 by &quot;Evening&quot;, which received a medal of the second class, and afterwards became widely popular under the title &quot;Lost Illusions&quot;. It depicts a poet seated on the bank of a river, with his head drooping and a wearied posture, letting his lyre slip from a careless hand, and gazing sadly at a bright company of maidens whose song slowly fades from his ear as their boat is borne slowly from his sight.

In spite of the success of these first ventures, Gleyre retired from public competition, and spent the rest of his life in quiet devotion to his artistic ideals, neither seeking the easy applause of the crowd, nor turning his art into a means of aggrandizement and wealth. After 1845, when he exhibited the &quot;Separation of the Apostles&quot;, he contributed nothing to the Salon except the &quot;La Dance des bacchantes&quot; in 1849. Yet he worked steadily and was productive. He had an &quot;infinite capacity of taking pains&quot;, and when asked by what method he attained to such marvelous perfection of workmanship, he would reply, &quot;En y pensant toujours&quot;. Many years often intervened between the first conception of a piece and its embodiment, and years not infrequently between the first and the final stage of the embodiment itself. A landscape was apparently finished; even his fellow artists would consider it done; Gleyre alone was conscious that he had not &quot;found his sky&quot;.

Gleyre became influential as a teacher, taking over the studio of Paul Delaroche – then the leading private teaching atelier in Paris – in 1843. His students included Jean-Léon Gérôme, Jean-Louis Hamon, Auguste Toulmouche, Whistler and several of the Impressionists: Monet, Renoir, Sisley, and Bazille. He did not charge his students a fee, although he expected them to contribute towards the rent and the payment of models. They were also given a say in the running of the school.

Though he lived in almost complete retirement from public life, he took a keen interest in politics, and was a voracious reader of political journals. For a time, under Louis Philippe, his studio had been the rendezvous of a sort of liberal club. To the last—amid all the disasters that befell his country—he was hopeful of the future, &quot;la raison finira bien par avoir raison&quot;. It was while on a visit to the Retrospective Exhibition, opened on behalf of the exiles from Alsace and Lorraine, that he died suddenly on 5 May 1874. He had never married.

He left unfinished the &quot;Earthly Paradise&quot;, a picture, which Taine described as &quot;a dream of innocence, of happiness and of beauty—Adam and Eve standing in the sublime and joyous landscape of a paradise enclosed in mountains&quot;, a worthy counterpart to &quot;Evening&quot;. His other works include &quot;Deluge&quot;, which represents two angels speeding above the desolate earth from which the destroying waters have just begun to retire, leaving visible behind them the ruin they have wrought; the &quot;Battle of the Lemanus&quot;, a piece of elaborate design, crowded but not encumbered with figures, and giving fine expression to the movements of the various bands of combatants and fugitives; the &quot;Prodigal Son&quot;, in which the artist has ventured to add to the parable the new element of mother&#x27;s love, greeting the repentant youth with a welcome that shows that the mother&#x27;s heart thinks less of the repentance than of the return; &quot;Ruth and Boaz&quot;; &quot;Ulysses and Nausicaa&quot;; &quot;Hercules at the Feet of Omphale&quot;; the &quot;Young Athenian,&quot; or, as it is popularly called, &quot;Sappho&quot;; &quot;Minerva and the Nymphs&quot;; &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot;; &quot;Daphnis and Chloë&quot;; and &quot;Love and the Parcae&quot;. He also left a considerable number of drawings and watercolours, and a number of portraits, among which is the sad face of Heinrich Heine, engraved in the &quot;Revue des deux mondes&quot; for April 1852. In Clement&#x27;s catalogue of his works there are 683 entries, including sketches and studies.

<doc id="411636" wikidata="Q7361" url="?curid=411636" title="Emperor Huai of Jin">
<text>Emperor Huai of Jin (; 284 – March 14, 313), personal name Sima Chi (司馬熾), courtesy name Fengdu (豐度), was an emperor of the Jin dynasty.

Emperor Huai was captured in July 311 (Disaster of Yongjia) and later executed in 313 under the order of Liu Cong, ruler of the Xiongnu state of Han-Zhao.

==As Prince of Yuzhang and crown prince==
Sima Chi was one of the youngest sons of Sima Yan, the founding emperor of Jin, by his concubine Consort Wang Yuanji (王媛姬). Just prior to Emperor Wu&#x27;s death in May 290, Prince Chi was created the Prince of Yuzhang on 22 December 289. During the early stages of the War of the Eight Princes during the reign of his developmentally disabled half-brother Sima Zhong, unlike the other princes fighting for power, Prince Chi did not involve himself in political or military matters, but spent his time studying history instead.

In late 304, when Emperor Hui was forcibly taken from the capital Luoyang to Chang&#x27;an, then under the control of the regent Sima Yong Prince of Hejian, Prince Chi was forced to accompany the emperor. In February 305, when his more ambitious half-brother Sima Ying the crown prince was demoted back to Prince of Chengdu by Sima Yong, Prince Chi was created crown prince to replace him. He was initially going to decline the honor, believing that his nephew Sima Tan the Prince of Qinghe and one-time crown prince should be returned to that position, but was persuaded to accept by his associate Xiu Su (). Later, after Sima Yue the Prince of Donghai defeated Sima Yong in 306, Crown Prince Chi accompanied Emperor Hui and returned to Luoyang.

In January 307, Emperor Hui was poisoned. (Most historians believe that Sima Yue ordered the murder, but there is no conclusive evidence.) Emperor Hui&#x27;s wife, Yang Xianrong, believing that she would not be honored as empress dowager if her brother-in-law inherited the throne, tried to have Sima Tan declared emperor; she was rebuffed by Sima Yue, however, and Crown Prince Chi succeeded to the throne as Emperor Huai. Emperor Huai honored her with the title &quot;Empress Hui,&quot; but not empress dowager. He created his wife Crown Princess Liang Lanbi empress.

==Reign==
Emperor Huai was commonly regarded as an intelligent man, and he tried to institute reforms that he felt would allow the empire to recover from the ravages of the War of the Eight Princes and the subsequent Wu Hu and agrarian uprisings. However, Sima Yue maintained a tight grip on power and would not allow the emperor to exercise much actual authority.

On 8 May 307, Emperor Huai created Sima Tan&#x27;s brother (and therefore fellow son of Emperor Huai&#x27;s half-brother Sima Xia () the Prince of Qinghe) Sima Quan () crown prince. (His apparent conclusion, at the young age of 23, that he should make a nephew his heir, may indicate that he considered himself infertile.)

In spring 307, Sima Yue left Luoyang and set up headquarters at Xuchang (許昌, in modern Xuchang, Henan), but continued to control the government remotely. In 309, Sima Yue, concerned about Emperor Huai&#x27;s increasing exercise of authority, made a sudden return to Luoyang and arrested and executed a number of Emperor Huai&#x27;s associates, including Emperor Huai&#x27;s uncle Wang Yan (). Other than privately mourning them, there was nothing that Emperor Huai could do. Sima Yue further disbanded the imperial guards and put his own personal forces in charge of protecting the emperor.

For all of Sima Yue&#x27;s assertion of authority, he could not stop Han, under its generals Liu Cong the Prince of Chu (the son of Han&#x27;s emperor Liu Yuan), Liu Yao the Prince of Shi&#x27;an (Liu Yuan&#x27;s nephew), Wang Mi (), and Shi Le (), from disrupting Jin rule throughout northern and central China and gradually wearing out Jin forces and capturing Jin cities and towns. In late 309, he managed to fight off a joint attack by Liu Cong and Wang on Luoyang, but that victory was the exception to Han&#x27;s inexorable advances. After Liu Yuan died in 310 and was succeeded by Liu Cong, Han renewed its attacks on the Luoyang region. Meanwhile, Sima Yue continued to alienate other generals and officials, and when Liu Kun (), the military commander of Bing (并州, roughly modern Shanxi) proposed to him the plan of an attack on the Han capital Pingyang (平陽, in modern Linfen, Shanxi) in conjunction with the powerful Xianbei chieftain Tuoba Yilu () the Duke of Dai, Sima Yue was fearful of a backstabbing attack by some of these warlords and therefore did not accept Liu&#x27;s plan. Indeed, when Emperor Huai and Sima Yue sent out calls for the various governors to come to Luoyang&#x27;s aid later that year, there were few responses. Sima Yue became uncertain of himself, and late in 310 left Luoyang with virtually all of the central government&#x27;s remaining troops, along with a large number of officials, effectively stripping Luoyang and Emperor Huai bare of their defenses, except for a small detachment commanded by Sima Yue&#x27;s subordinate He Lun (), intended as much to monitor as to protect Emperor Huai. From that point on, Luoyang was left even without a police force and became largely a city abandoned to bandits and thugs.

Emperor Huai soon entered into a plan with Gou Xi (苟晞), the military commander of Qing Province (青州, modern central and eastern Shandong), who had been dissatisfied with Sima Yue, to overthrow Sima Yue&#x27;s yoke. Sima Yue discovered this plan, but was unable to wage a campaign against Gou. He grew ill in his anger and distress, and died in April 311. The generals and officials in his army, instead of returning to Luoyang, headed east toward Sima Yue&#x27;s principality of Donghai (roughly modern Linyi, Shandong) to bury him there. He Lun, upon hearing about Sima Yue&#x27;s death, also withdrew from Luoyang and sought to join that force. However, both were intercepted by Shi Le and wiped out. Shi, declaring that Sima Yue had caused the empire much damage, burned Sima Yue&#x27;s body. Sima Yue&#x27;s sons were all captured and presumably killed by Shi.

Sima Yue&#x27;s death, however, only left Emperor Huai even more vulnerable to Han attacks. Gou sent a force to welcome Emperor Huai to move the capital to Cangyuan (倉垣, in modern Kaifeng, Henan), and Emperor Huai was going to do so, but his officials all still missed Luoyang and did not want to leave. Soon, however, the famine that had already overtaken Luoyang got even more severe. Emperor Huai resolved to head for Cangyuan, but with Gou&#x27;s force having already left Luoyang, was unable to even leave the palace without being attacked by bandits, and therefore was forced to return to the palace. In summer 311, knowing that Luoyang was defenseless, the Han generals Liu Yao, Wang Mi, Shi Le, and Huyan Yan converged on Luoyang, and they easily captured Emperor Huai on 13 July, in what is known as the Disaster of Yongjia. A large number of Jin nobility was slaughtered, although Emperor Huai was, for the time being, spared and delivered to the Han capital Pingyang, to be presented to the emperor Liu Cong. Liu Cong created Emperor Huai the Duke of Ping&#x27;a.

==After capture by Han-Zhao==
For one and a half years, the former Jin emperor lived a humiliating existence in the Han capital. In 312, Liu Cong promoted him to the title of the Duke of Kuaiji. Once, after inviting the duke to a feast, Liu Cong commented on a meeting they had while the former emperor was still the Prince of Yuzhang, leading to a notable colloquy. Liu Cong first stated,

:&quot;When you were the Prince of Yuzhang, I had once visited you with Wang Ji (王濟). Wang praised me, and you said, &quot;I have long heard of your fame.&quot; You showed me the music that you had written, and then asked me and Wang to write lyrics for them. We wrote lyrics praising you, and you liked them. Then, we spent some time shooting arrows; I hit the target 12 times, and both you and Wang hit nine times. You gave me gifts of a mulberry bow and a silver inkstone. Do you still remember?&quot;

The duke responded, &quot;How can I forget? What I regret is not realizing that I was in the presence of a dragon.&quot; Liu Cong, impressed by the flattery, then asked, &quot;How is it that your clan members slaughtered each other?&quot; The duke replied:

:&quot;This is not a human matter, but was the will of Heaven. The great Han was going to receive divine favor, so our clan eliminated itself for Han. If our clan members could follow the directives of Emperor Wu and remain united, how could Your Imperial Majesty become emperor?&quot;

Liu Cong was impressed, and they spent all night talking. The next day, Liu Cong gave one of his favorite concubines to the duke as a gift, creating her as the Duchess of Kuaiji.

In 313, however, the former emperor would suffer his death. At the imperial new year celebration, Liu Cong ordered him to serve the high level officials wine, and former Jin officials Yu Min () and Wang Juan () could not control their emotions at seeing his humiliation, and cried out loudly. This made Liu Cong angry, and he falsely accused Yu and Wang, along with a number of former Jin officials, of being ready to betray Pingyang and offer it to the Jin general Liu Kun. He then executed those former Jin officials and poisoned the former emperor.

<text>Einbeck (; Eastphalian: &quot;Aimbeck&quot;) is a town in the district Northeim, in southern Lower Saxony, Germany, on the German Timber-Frame Road.

== History ==

===Prehistory===
The area of the current city of Einbeck is inhabited since prehistoric times. Various artifacts have been unearthed in the city of Einbeck itself and in the little villages and lost villages around it over the years. They date back to the Paleolithic Era.

=== Medieval period ===
In the Early Middle Ages a number of villages existed along the river Ilme in the middle Leine valley before Einbeck was founded. On January 1, 1158 Einbeck was first mentioned in a deed of Friedrich Barbarossa, which mentioned &quot;… in loco qui Einbike vocatur …&quot;. and related to a transfer of an estate in the 11th century. Count Udo of Katlenburg owned an estate on the bank of a brook, the Krummes Wasser (crooked water). His grandson founded the stift Sankt Alexandri, that subsequently developed into an important sanctuary. On the other side of this brook a market town developed at the end of the 12th century, mainly due to convenient access for traffic. A church was built there as well, the market church (St. Jacob). The floodplain between market and stift was filled in and covered with buildings. The market and stift were walled in and a moat was built. In 1252 Einbeck received a town charter and a town council was established. In 1279 the town received through its sovereign, Heinrich Mirabilis, an extension of its town charter. Einbeck was topographically extended and a town wall is mentioned that enclosed the market church St. Jacob and the stift St. Alexandri. St Jacob was (and is) located in the center of the city around the &#x27;old market&#x27;, St. Alexandri was built only some hundred meters away. Extensions were called the &#x27;new market&#x27;, first mentioned 1389 as was the &#x27;new town&#x27;. The new town received its own church, St. Mary, first mentioned 1318.

==== Beer ====
The city gained importance during the reign of the dukes of Grubenhagen. Smaller villages as Oldendorf or Tiedexen were deserted and inhabitants moved inside the city walls. Written evidence about the export of Einbecker beer dates back to 1351. The beer was brewed in larger houses that had the entitlement to brew. These houses are still easily identified through their arched wide doors, necessary to move in the brewing kettle, called a brewing pan. The organization of the process and the marketing of the beer was led by the city council. Einbeck joined the Hanse in 1368 thus broadening the distribution area which now reached from Antwerp in the west to Riga in the east and from Stockholm in the north to Munich in the south. In Munich the name Einbeck was mispronounced as &quot;oan bock&quot; (a billy goat), and when the ducal brewhouse copied the taste, Bock style beer was born.

==== Monasteries ====

In the 14th and 15th centuries a number of monasteries were created: Sisters of Maria and Magdalen, an Austin hermit monastery, and a monastery of the Order of the Poor Ladies. A system of sconces and towers were built outside the city walls as an early warning system against enemies. This time was a golden age for Einbeck and it was one of the largest cities in Northern Germany.
=== Modern period ===
In July 1540 the city of Einbeck was nearly completely destroyed by a fire, which was started by an arsonist. What role the religious upheaval following the very recently introduced reformation played is unknown. Convicted of the crime, the arsonist, Heinrich Diek, was tortured and died while being publicly displayed in an iron cage. This cage is still on display in the town hall. As the town had been quite wealthy before the fire, it was rebuilt very fast. Einbeck joined the Schmalkaldic League, a system of military defence of Lutheran princes and cities, which was a very costly exercise. In 1549 a fire once again swept through the city. This time the southern part of the city was mainly affected and 580 houses burned down. In 1580 the city council signed the Formula of Concord which completed reformation. In 1597 the plague took a huge death toll. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War the city was occupied by enemy troops during 1632 and 1641 and some hundred houses destroyed. During the Seven Years&#x27; War, (known as the French and Indian War in North America), the city gates were taken down and most of the city walls were destroyed.

This all led to times of economic and political vulnerability. As the neighbouring village Rotenkirchen developed into the administrative seat of the area, its sovereign was able to curb the autonomy of Einbeck. Later Einbeck became a garrison for infantry units, which eased its economic difficulties. During the Napoleonic Wars it became the administrative seat of the district of Einbeck from 1807 to 1813. In 1826 the area around St. Maria burned down, replaced by a new county courthouse “Amtsgericht”. After Prussia won the war against the Kingdom of Hannover in 1866, barracks for the Prussian Army were built, now the &#x27;New Town Hall&#x27; and administrative building of the city council. Einbeck initially resisted plans to connect itself to the railway line Hannover – Kassel, but in 1879 a line between Salzderhelden and Einbeck was built. In 1885 Einbeck was made seat of the newly formed county of Einbeck. Beginning in 1890 the bicycle manufacturing and trading company of August Stukenbrok developed into the largest mail order business in Germany, although it later went into receivership during The Great Depression in 1931. In 1896 the garrison was closed and the building used as a technical college until 1907.

Einbeck was hit hard by the economic difficulties following the end of World War I, and from 1930 on, its citizens leaned toward non-democratic parties. During the last free vote before Hitler took power, the National Socialists (NSDAP) had a share of 40.9% of the electorate in Einbeck. During the pogrom of November 1938 NSDAP followers set fire to the Synagogue in the Bismarckstraße. Of the 58 Jewish citizens of Einbeck; 21 emigrated outside of Germany, 32 were killed or died of disease in concentration camps, three committed suicide, and five have not been able to be traced. A month before German surrender, the city manager of Einbeck (without permission from his superiors) gave over the city to United States troops on April 9, 1945. This helped Einbeck to survive the war physically undamaged.

In 1946, the population of Einbeck doubled through the influx of displaced persons from the former Eastern territories of Germany, mainly from Silesia. This led to a boom in the construction of new residential houses and later, industrial buildings as well. Residential housing expanded the city in an easterly direction, while industrial building grew to the south. Some substantial companies did set up shop in Einbeck, the largest today (2023) being KWS.

In 1971 the villages Holtensen, Hullersen, Immensen, and Odagsen were incorporated into the city of Einbeck, while the county of Einbeck was disbanded in 1974. At the same time Einbeck incorporated further 27 villages from the old counties of Einbeck, Gandersheim, and Northeim. Einbeck is administratively a &#x27;Medium Centre&#x27;, which means it provides services like high school, hospital‚ notary public, local court, etc. In 2005 a fire destroyed one historical building and damaged five more. Seven years later two more heritage-listed buildings were destroyed by fire.

On October 19, 2011, the city council adopted a resolution to incorporate the neighbouring community of Kreiensen beginning January 1, 2013. 
Einbeck therefore is the legal successor of Kreiensen and it grew substantially again in terms of territory and population.

==Geography==
Einbeck has 46 municipalities, which were previously independent villages. The city lies directly south of the Hube (hills), where the Ilme flows into the Leine. In January 2013, the former municipality Kreiensen joined Einbeck.

===Climate===
==Economy==
Einbeck had various industries over time that came and went. Yet from very early on beer has been the product Einbeck is famous for over many centuries, still sold under the brand &quot;Einbecker Bier&quot;. Einbeck is the birthplace of bock beer, a beer with a high alcohol content. In medieval times a brewmaster from Einbeck was hired to brew „Einpöckisch Bier“ in Munich. The name was corrupted and developed into „Oanpock“, and subsequently into „Bock“. The export of beer was a very important business so that in the harbour city of Hamburg Einbeck had its own distribution center (and pub), called the Eimbeck&#x27;sches Haus. A brewery is still operating in Einbeck under the name &quot;Einbecker Brewery&quot;. The company is listed on the Hanover Stock Exchange.

Another business in Einbeck has a very long tradition: &quot;Einbecker Blaudruck&quot;, a traditional way to print on fabric. The privately owned business was founded in 1638 and is the oldest business of the kind still in existence in Europe.

A worldwide business headquartered in Einbeck is &quot;KWS SAAT AG&quot;, listed in the German SDAX. It grew out of breeding seed for sugar beet and is now a full line seed supplier to the farming industry worldwide. KWS operates more than 60 subsidiaries worldwide with sales of close to 1 billion € and a total of 3,800 employees. The main research and development activities are based in Einbeck.

&quot;Kayser Automotive Systems&quot; is an international supplier of components for the car industry. Kayser is a family business headquartered in Einbeck. A branch of the car component supplier &quot;Dura Automotive Systems&quot; is active in Einbeck. &quot;E. Oppermann&quot; is a family controlled international belt webbing manufacturer. The chain manufacturer &quot;Renold&quot; has its German subsidiary in Einbeck. &quot;Kurt König&quot; is a service and sales company for building and construction machinery.

== Politics ==

=== City council ===
A by-election was held on 20 January 2013 for the city council and all village councils due to the incorporation of the former community of Kreiensen into the city of Einbeck. The results were as follows:
=== Former city managers ===
* 1948–1981 Heinrich Keim
* 1981–1992 Georg Lampe
* 1992–1997 Bernd Röll

=== Full-time mayors ===
* 1 January 1998 until 31 October 2006: Martin Wehner (SPD)
* 1 November 2006 until 24 January 2013: Ulrich Minkner (SPD)
* since 24 January 2013: Sabine Michalek (CDU)

== Suburbs ==
Of the 32,000 inhabitants of Einbeck only about 15.000 live in the city of Einbeck, the next largest suburb is Kreiensen with about 2,500 inhabitants. The city of Einbeck began to incorporate the first neighbouring villages in 1971, a larger batch followed in 1974. In 2013 Einbeck incorporated Kreiensen which itself had previously incorporated 15 villages. So the geographical size of Einbeck is unusually large. In total Einbeck has 46 suburbs since 2013:

== Culture ==


The historical center of Einbeck provides a nearly complete example of a late medieval town built in the half-timbered construction method. This is why Einbeck was made part of the German Timber-Frame Road.

After the fire of July 1540, that nearly destroyed all residential buildings, the city was very swiftly rebuilt during the next 15 years. The year of construction is very often carved into the frames. This is why a very similar style of buildings is found in the center of the city. The old cellars or basements below the buildings, not affected by the fire, were re-used to build the new houses in the same place. A very pretty example is the northern side of Tiedexer Straße, The wide arched doors, necessary to go in out with a wagon, can be seen here. More than half of these buildings had entitlements to brew.

Einbeck is famous for its piano stage. Every winter it hosts the international piano academy „Feuerwerk“, every spring young pianists from all Germany compete in the Einbecker Klavierfrühling competition. Both events are established and led by the Lithuanian concert pianist and pedagogue Gintaras Januševičius. There are plenty of piano recitals hosted around the year, with both professional and amateur performers on stage. Since 2019 the city brands itself as &quot;Klavierstadt“ (“Piano City“).

==GAPP==
For many years, the city&#x27;s high school has had an exchange programme, known as GAPP or German-American Partnership Program, with Roy High School and Ogden High School (Utah) in Utah. Every other year Einbeck students fly to Roy in October to spend two weeks with host families and attend Roy and Ogden High Schools. After their two-week stay the German students travel to places in the US such as Moab, Las Vegas and California. The Roy and Ogden High students visit Einbeck every other year during their summer break.

Since 2002, Einbeck has been a twin town with Keene, New Hampshire, USA. A delegation of high school football (soccer) players, coaches and city officials visited Keene on July 1, 2010 and spent a week touring the city, playing exhibition games and watching the World Cup with the locals.

==Twin towns==

Einbeck is twinned with:

* Thiais, France (1962)
* Artern, Germany (1990)
* Patschkau, Paczków, Poland (1992)
* Keene, United States (2002)
* Wieselburg, Austria (1987)
==Transport==

===Road===
There is direct access to Federal Highway “B 3” Bundesstraße 3 running in a north–south direction, connecting Hannover to Kassel, each about away. Until the 1994 “B 3” ran through the city centre, but there is now a bypass open.

Access to National Motorway “A 7” Bundesautobahn 7 is about away. “A 7” connects Flensburg, on the German/Danish border, with Reutte in Austria and roughly runs in a north–south direction as well.

===Rail===
The Einbeck-Salzderhelden station is located on the Hanoverian Southern Railway part of the main North–South railway between Hanover and Kassel. Services run at approximately hourly intervals.

The larger railway station in Einbeck is Kreiensen, which provides in addition to the services mentioned above, train connections to the West (Holzminden, Altenbeken) and North East (Seesen, Goslar, Brunswick).

In 2018 the railway station Einbeck Mitte in the city centre of Einbeck reopened after 34 years. Today there is an hourly train service between Einbeck Mitte and Salzderhelden and six additional through services between Einbeck Mitte and Göttingen in both directions.

The closest high speed train station is Göttingen, about away. Göttingen can be reached from Salzderhelden in hourly intervals.

Einbeck has a small railway company, Ilmebahn, which runs rail freight services.

===Bus===
Einbeck is part of a transport association in the South of Lower Saxony, VSN, which connects virtually all smaller villages with the cities in South Lower Saxony. Ilmebahn, the local transport company runs local bus services, as does RBB (Regionalbus Braunschweig).

===Air===
The next international airport is Hannover Airport, with connections to major European cities. This airport can be reached by train. A smaller airport mainly for holiday travelers Kassel-Calden is about away.

<text>The Volvo 164 is a 4-door, 6-cylinder luxury sedan unveiled by Volvo at the Paris Motor Show early in October 1968 and first sold as a 1969 model. 146,008 164s were built before the car was succeeded by the mid-size luxury 264 in 1975, although some sources state 153,179 were built). The 164 was Volvo&#x27;s first venture into the luxury segment since the end of PV 60 production in 1950, and was the first six-cylinder Volvo since the PV800 last produced in 1958.

==History==
Jan Wilsgaard designed what would eventually become the 164 in the late 1950s as a concept car called the P358 and powered by a V8 engine. The front styling somewhat resembles the Wolseley 6/99 and the Volvo P1900., more so by the Ferrari 375 Agnelli, which influenced the Jaguar XJ as well.

In 1968 Volvo introduced the 164 as a luxury version of their 140 series. The wings, the grille, the front bumper, the bonnet, the headlamp bezels, and the front indicators were all unique to the 164; to accommodate the long 3-litre 6-cylinder engine the 164&#x27;s wings and bonnet were longer than those of the 4-cylinder 140, but the overall height and width of the 164 were the same as the 140 series. The interior featured a simulated woodgrain dashboard face and leather seating surfaces. Introduced the same year as the BMW E3, the 164 was Volvo&#x27;s answer to the Mercedes-Benz 250 and Jaguar XJ6. The 164 compared favourably in terms of fuel economy with similarly sized 6-cylinder European cars such as the BMW 530.

in 1972 an update saw the introduction of fuel injection to the 164 with the B30E (high compression) and B30F (low compression) engines which utilised Bosch D-Jetronic injection. Also for 1972 the dash was slightly revised with he introduction of a centre console and some of the dash switches, as well as the clock, were moved to it as well as being redesigned. The flush mounted pull style door handles also appeared for the 1972 model year.

In 1973 the 164 received a major facelift including new rear and side lamps, a new grille and front bumper, and a new instrument cluster and dashboard which included air ducts.

In 1974 the doors were revised and strengthened and the vent wings were eliminated due to the panel vents introduced in 1973, and the 164 became one of the earliest cars to offer heated seats. The instrument cluster changed slightly with the introduction of the bulb failure indicator and the fuel gauge received revised markings with the 1/2 mark moved to the centre of the gauge and the red reserve section shrinking significantly. Underneath, the floor pan was revised and the fuel tank was moved from the boot floor to closer to the rear axle for better protection in the case of an accident.

A limited edition of the 164, the 164TE was made only in 1974 and only for 3 markets, Great Britain, Germany and Australia. The 164TE had extra accessories fitted as standard, being air conditioning, 4 speaker 8 track player with radio, headlight wipe/wash system, rear head rests, rear reading lamps and a fully carpeted boot with lighting. This more upmarket version was only available in 3 colours, being metallic light blue (colour 111), metallic copper (colour 105) and metallic teal (colour 115).

For 1975 (1976 in America and Japan) the 164 was replaced by the 264 which was powered by the PRV 2.7-liter V6 engine. The PRV engine was not immediately able to meet Federal emissions standards, so the 164 was kept in limited production for one more year for the American and Japanese markets – although only small numbers were sold. The 164 received new, larger six-panel rear lamps sometime during the 1975 model year, electronic ignition, new seats, electric windows in the front, a new style of badging, extensive changes to the rear suspension, and the parking brake handle was moved from outboard to inboard of the driving seat. Due to much of the changes coming from the 200 series, as the 200 series switched to metric bolt patterns, the 164 uses a mix of imperial and metric bolt patterns on the car.

==Engine and powertrain==
The 164 was powered by a 3-litre overhead-valve B30 engine, a 6-cylinder derivative of the B20 4-cylinder engine that powered most other Volvo models.

1969–1971 models were all equipped with dual Zenith Stromberg 175CD2SE constant-depression carburettors. In 1972, Bosch&#x27;s first volume-production electronic fuel injection system, D-Jetronic, was offered as optional equipment. Carburettors were dropped and &quot;D-Jet&quot; became standard equipment for the 1974 model year. Cars equipped with the fuel injection were badged as 164E models, the &quot;E&quot; standing for &quot;einspritzung&quot; (German for &quot;injection&quot;). Like other fuel-injected Volvos, the 164E models gave improved performance and driveability with less toxic exhaust than their carburettored counterparts.

Performance:

Volvo 164E DIN. Acc 0–100 km/h 8.7 sec. Acc 0–160 km/h 24.4 sec. Top speed 193.5 km/h.

==Transmission==
Transmission options included a manual 4-speed M400 gearbox, which was known as the M410 when equipped with the optional electrically operated Laycock de Normanville overdrive. Both the M400 and M410 had Volvo&#x27;s &quot;remote control&quot; shift mechanism, which used a conventionally short, vertical shift stick placed between the front seats; manual-shift models other than the 164 and the P1800 continued until 1971 to use Volvo&#x27;s direct-control shifter with an extremely long, almost horizontal shift lever with its pivot point well under the dashboard. A 3-speed automatic transmission, the BW35 made by Borg-Warner, was also offered. The automatic shift selector was mounted on the steering column from 1969 through 1971, and on the floor from 1972 through 1975. Despite its rough operation and inefficiency, the BW35 was popular in the North American and Australian markets.

==Body and chassis==
The 164 was offered only as a 4-door sedan, and shares many body and chassis components with the 144. From the cowl rearward, body sheetmetal is identical with the exception of the remote shifter transmission tunnel, which was added to the 140 series in 1972. The front of the 164 was extended 6 cm and the wheelbase gained 10 cm to accommodate the length of the 6-cylinder engine.

==Descendants==
When developing the Volvo 262C coupé in the mid-seventies, Volvo employed a 164 as a testbed. The resulting two-door &quot;162&quot; with a chopped and vinyl-covered roof—features that were eventually applied to the 262C—is on permanent display at the Volvo Museum in Gothenburg, Sweden. As of 2016, the Volvo counterpart of the 164 is the S90.

<doc id="411644" wikidata="Q486556" url="?curid=411644" title="Dassel">
<text>Dassel is a town in southern Lower Saxony, Germany, located in the district Northeim. It is located near the hills of the Solling mountains.

==Geography==
The city covers an area of . Buildings and streets make up about 10% of this area while 26% are covered with forests like Ellensen Forest and 62% are in agricultural usage, especially for cereals and rapeseed cultivation. For this, the local soil horizon provides suitable conditions as sediments below the soil layer are made up of loess. Dassel is located in the temperate climate zone.

==History==
Dassel dates back to the year 860 when it was mentioned in a deed of the Imperial Abbey of Corvey. In 1022, Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor, in another deed referred to Dassel church. By about 1113, Dassel became a base of the counts of Dassel, whose name is derived from the name of the settlement. As the county of Dassel ceased to exist in 1310, Dassel was sold to Siegfried II, bishop of the diocese of Hildesheim. Shortly thereafter, in 1315, he provided his acquisition with town rights because the surrounding region belonged to the principality of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, thus to enemies of the bishop of Hildesheim. Once given town rights, inhabitants of Dassel built a defensive wall. Town administration operated from Hunnesrück Castle, on a nearby hill. That caste was occupied by the dukes of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel as a result of the Hildesheim Diocesan Feud in 1521. Duke Eric I ordered to tear down Hunnesrück castle and had the Erichsburg castle built instead. Dassel was administrated from there until 1643. As a result of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Dassel was merged with the diocese of Hildesheim in 1643. The bishops had new administration buildings built in a place called Hunnesrück, situated between the destroyed Hunnesrück castle and the Erichsburg. Throughout those centuries, these circumstances restrained Dassel from proper development and it was thus overcome by the neighboring city of Einbeck that was founded later than Dassel. In addition, parts of the city were destroyed in fires in the 19th century. In that time, some inhabitants started to weave linen or to trade with it, while others emigrated to USA. At the beginning of the 20th century Dassel had 1462 inhabitants. Around 1920 the number of inhabitants amounted to 1601. During World War II the town remained undamaged. Therefore, several expellees settled in Dassel. On March 1, 1974, Dassel was merged with several other small municipalities of the Ilme valley. The new borough now covers the area of the historic County of Dassel, which ceased to exist in 1310. On 15 April 2010 Dassel and its incorporated villages had 11434 inhabitants of whom 2597 lived in the historic town of Dassel itself.

==Main Sights==
* St. Laurence&#x27;s Church from 1447, a gothic building with Renaissance time mural.
* Catholic St. Michael&#x27;s Church, built in a classicist style in 1847, is sightworthy because of several masterpieces of art, e.g. a baroque altar and a baptismal font dating from 1700.
* Old Town Hall at the Market Place, built in 1817. Opposite there is a sightworthy old mill (&quot;Stadtmühle&quot;) founded in 1558 and built of reddish sandstone. It was used as a mill until 1969.
* Medieval wall surrounding the old town center. Close to the new town hall, which was built in the 1970s outside the historic center, a sightworthy gothic arch can be seen. Next to it the house &quot;An der Stadtmauer 4&quot; includes the last tower of the medieval wall, the Baldertower 
* Dassel has many well-preserved half-timbered houses, e.g. in &quot;Neue Strasse&quot; and &quot;Obere Strasse&quot; streets.
* Former Jewish Cemetery on &quot;Sievershaeuser Strasse&quot; road. About 20 well-preserved gravestones can be seen. Some of them have Hebrew inscriptions.
* Former train station, a half-timbered building constructed at the end of the 19th century. When the railway line was closed, it was transformed into a residential building.
* Forge &quot;Blankschmiede&quot;, dating from 1727 and renovated 1988-93. Now it is a museum. Teichplatz 2.
* Museum of the County of Dassel (&quot;Museum der Grafschaft Dassel&quot;), Teichplatz 1.

==Education==
The &quot;Gymnasium&quot; (college preparatory school) in Dassel is named after Paul Gerhardt. The other general schools are two primary schools (elementary schools), and a secondary school (&quot;Realschule&quot;), which is named after Rainald von Dassel.

==Notable people==

* Rainald of Dassel, (1120-1167), archbishop
* Carl Busse (1772-1829), in the first decades of the 19th century was a pastor in various northern German towns and wrote during this time numerous theological treatises.
* Wilhelm Busch (1832-1908), the humorous poet lived intermittently from 1846 to 1897 in the district Lüthorst
* Heinrich Düker (1898-1986), 1946-1947 mayor of Göttingen, psychologist

==Transportation==
Dassel was the endpoint of a private railway line from Einbeck since 1883. Its length amounted to 13.1 km. In 1975, the line was closed for passenger transport, and in 2003 for goods as well. Afterwards the railway line was replaced by a bus line. The former train station which was transformed into a residential building is well preserved.

Dassel is easily accessible by bus from the neighbouring towns of Einbeck and Stadtoldendorf.

<doc id="411645" wikidata="Q7274026" url="?curid=411645" title="Reuben Swinburne Clymer">
<text>Reuben Swinburne Clymer (November 25, 1878 - June 3, 1966) was an American occultist and modern Rosicrucian Supreme Grand Master of the FRC (Fraternitas Rosae Crucis), perhaps the oldest continuing Rosicrucian organization in the Americas. He practiced alternative medicine, and wrote and published works on it as well as (his version of) the teachings of Paschal Beverly Randolph (1825-1875), alchemy, nutrition, religion, sex magic and spiritualism. This led to a number of conflicts with Harvey Spencer Lewis (1883-1939) and the AMORC (Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis), FUDOSI, Aleister Crowley, and even the American Medical Association.

== Life ==
Clymer was born in Quakertown, Pennsylvania. He studied medicine in Chicago, Illinois, and registered as an osteopath in New York in 1910. His work with alternative medicine regularly brought him into trouble with the United States government and the American Medical Association (AMA). Clymer was investigated by the AMA&#x27;s Journal Bureau of Investigation in 1923. They commented that &quot;our records fail to show that this man ever regularly graduated by any reputable medical college.&quot; Clymer was listed as a graduate of the &quot;Independent Medical College&quot; in Chicago, 1898. However, this was a diploma mill which sold diplomas to anyone.

Clymer operated the &quot;International Academy of the Natural and Sacred Science&quot; from Union City, Michigan, which offered a course in the &quot;Natural System of Healing&quot;. This was a mail-order scheme and the degrees &quot;M.D. and &quot;D.O.&quot; were sold. Clymer was also involved with a school known as &quot;The Philosophers of the Living Fire&quot; which offered a mail-order scheme to obtain bogus degrees. A fraud order was issued by the United States postal authorities against the school &quot;for obtaining additional sums of money from credulous persons.&quot;

As an osteopath, he opposed vaccination, and claimed that meat was the primary cause of cancer, and (especially when combined with beans, bread, potatoes, and beer) immorality and insanity.

Clymer promoted a pescatarian diet. He opposed the consumption of red meat which he believed was toxic. In 1917, &quot;The Rose Cross Aid Cook Book&quot; was authored by Clara Witt which conformed to the dietary advice of Clymer and reflected Rosicrucian theology. In 1919, Clymer authored &quot;Diet: The Way to Health&quot;. He commented that &quot;Meat, of any nature, is entirely unnecessary for either the maintenance of health or for the restoration to health of those who have become weak and ill. Fish and other sea food, milk and other dairy products, and eggs, will take the place of meat, and these do not contain the unhealthy ingredients or the acids and toxins contained in meat.&quot;

=== Randolph and the FRC ===
Clymer joined the FRC in 1897, becoming a grand master of it in 1905 at age 27.

In either 1900 or 1904, Clymer got into publishing with his Philosophical Publishing Company, which he used to keep Paschal Beverly Randolph&#x27;s books in print well into the 20th century. Clymer was deeply influenced by Randolph, of whom he created a hagiographic (and mostly fictitious) history. Clymer claimed that his occult orders were founded by Randolph (although many were completely unrelated), tying their already mostly fictional histories together under Randolph, particularly the Hermetic Brotherhood of Light orders in Quakertown.

Clymer created a more consistent and palatable belief system from Randolph&#x27;s thoughts, cleaning up the problematic sex magic practices Randolph espoused at times, as well as Randolph&#x27;s self-contradictions on numerous points. The pseudo-history assembled by Clymer cast Randolph as the legitimate heir of an ancient Rosicrucian tradition in America. This was accomplished by turning many people Randolph mentioned running into members of various occult organizations secretly connected to ancient Egyptian Rosicrucians, known members into masters of groups they were members of, and an unknown young man who met Eliphas Levi into none other than a young Randolph. If Clymer lacked a starting point or could not fill a plot hole, he claimed that such gaps were the result of the destruction of records by enemies of Randolph&#x27;s (and Clymer&#x27;s) Fraternitas. In addition to the standard claims of Western Occultism of ties to famous Neoplatonists, alchemists, magicians, Clymer also connected Randolph&#x27;s &quot;order&quot; to Abraham Lincoln, Napoleon III, Alexandre Saint-Yves d&#x27;Alveydre, Papus, Albert Pike, and the Count of St. Germain. Although Clymer apparently believed his biography of Randolph to be absolutely historical, it is understood now to be largely fictitious.

According to Clymer, Randolph founded the FRC in 1858, with control passing onto Freeman Dowd in 1875, then Edward Brown in 1907, then Clymer in 1922. Unlike a number of fraternal orders (particularly the Shriners), Clymer explicitly denied that Rosicrucians had any special ornamentation or jewelry. As a result, the FRC is noted for its lack of self-promotion and advertising.

Other organizations founded by Clymer include the Church of Illumination, the College of the Holy Grail, and the Sons of Isis and Osiris. The Church of Illumination serves as an outer body for the FRC, spreading its teachings under the name of &quot;Divine Law&quot; in hopes of bringing about a new era through symbolic alchemy.

=== Rivalry with Harvey Spencer Lewis and AMORC ===
Clymer&#x27;s claim to being the true leader of American Rosicrucianism put Clymer in direct competition with Harvey Spencer Lewis, founder of the AMORC (Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis). This competition was turned to bitter rivalry thanks to disagreement on the role of sex in magic, both sides accusing the other of perverse teachings, while holding that the sexual practices they advocated were enlightened and pure. Clymer&#x27;s views, largely lifted from Randolph, were that bodily fluids produced by a married couple needed to be regularly exchanged for the physical and spiritual health of each partner.

Clymer and Lewis competed for the attention of different national branches of the OTO (Ordo Templi Orientis) for official ties, with both finding comparable success and neither being able to use their ties to the O.T.O. to claim legitimacy over the other. When Lewis co-founded FUDOSI (which recognized Lewis&#x27;s AMORC as the true heirs of American Rosicrucianism), Clymer co-founded FUDOFSI with Constant Chevillon and Jean Bricaud (which favored Clymer&#x27;s FRC), and claimed that Lewis&#x27;s FUDOSI was a failed and mistaken grab at legitimization. In response to these attacks, AMORC published material calling Clymer&#x27;s ideas &quot;some of the weirdest notions that a human mind ever harboured,&quot; further pointing out that his positions were &quot;self-appointed and self-devised.&quot; Clymer retaliated by raising suspicion about Lewis&#x27;s doctorate, accusing Lewis of hocking inauthentic works, and (due to Lewis&#x27;s association with Aleister Crowley) practicing black magic. Crowley initially responded by offering to help Lewis fight Clymer, though Crowley&#x27;s later attempt to claim control of Lewis&#x27;s AMORC resulted in a rift between them.

The American rivalry eventually created a rift in European Rosicrucianism as well.

=== Later life ===
By 1939, Lewis&#x27;s death and legal attacks by the American Medical Association brought the rivalry between Clymer and AMORC to an end. Clymer continued to practice alternative medicine and lead the FRC until his death in 1966, when he was succeeded by his son Emerson Myron Clymer (October 16, 1909 - October 4, 1983).

== Writings ==
Clymer&#x27;s more popular writings include &quot;A Compendium of Occult Law&quot;, &quot;Mysteries of Osiris&quot;, and &quot;The Rosicrucian Fraternity in America&quot; (2 vols., 1935-1936). &quot;The Rosicrucian Fraternity in America&quot;, with emphasis on a single fraternity, was an attack on AMORC and Lewis.

He also translated some works of Ludovico Maria Sinistrari, though changing Sinistrari&#x27;s incubi and succubi to elementals and suggesting that the virgin birth of Jesus was the result of a Salamander impregnating Mary.

Clymer wrote books on nutrition (such as &quot;Dietetics&quot; and &quot;Diet, the Way to Health&quot;), as well as authorizing a &quot;Rose Cross Aid&quot; cookbook. In 1904, he wrote an anti-vaccinationist pamphlet titled &quot;Vaccination Brought Home to You&quot;, which documented two cases of children&#x27;s bad reactions to vaccines. A review by the &quot;Cleveland Medical and Surgical Reporter&quot; noted that &quot;the statements of the author are made so manifestly from the stand-point of rank prejudice that they do not deserve the name of arguments.&quot;

== Legacy ==

Clymer&#x27;s involvement in new religious movements, the drama that invariably followed Clymer and similar leaders (such as Father Divine), inspired a number of early 20th century detective stories, such as Dashiell Hammett&#x27;s &quot;The Dain Curse&quot;.

Clymer&#x27;s works are also standard reading for American Rosicrucians, and his interest in medicine is continued by the FRC to this day, with the Beverly Hall headquarters housing chiropractic and naturopathic clinics. His prolific writing about Paschal Beverly Randolph and his teachings remain influential in the study of Randolph, in part because little is known about Randolph.

<doc id="411647" wikidata="Q2394302" url="?curid=411647" title="Steve Forbert">
<text>Samuel Stephen Forbert (born December 13, 1954) is an American pop/folk singer-songwriter. His 1979 song &quot;Romeo&#x27;s Tune&quot; reached No. 11 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart. It also spent two weeks at No. 8 in Canada. Forbert&#x27;s first four albums all charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, with &quot;Jackrabbit Slim&quot; certified gold in Canada. In 2004, his &quot;Any Old Time&quot; album was nominated for a Grammy Award in the Best Traditional Folk category. Forbert has released 21 studio and 3 live albums.

Forbert&#x27;s songs have been recorded by several artists, including Rosanne Cash, Keith Urban, Marty Stuart and Webb Wilder. In 2017, a tribute album, &quot;An American Troubadour: The Songs of Steve Forbert&quot;, was released, with covers of his songs by twenty-one artists. Bob Harris of &quot;BBC Radio 2&quot; said Forbert has &quot;One of the most distinctive voices anywhere.&quot;

In September 2018, he released his self-penned memoir, &quot;Big City Cat: My Life in Folk Rock&quot;, with editor Therese Boyd. It accompanied the release of his 19th studio album &quot;The Magic Tree&quot; on Blue Rose Music.

==Early life==
Forbert was born in Meridian, Mississippi, United States. As a child, he fell in love with music, even playing air guitar in a pretend band he called The Mosquitos. Due to a fascination with Top 40 radio, he proclaimed himself a &quot;music junkie.&quot; At 17, he started writing songs. After high school, he attended junior college and worked as a truck driver. Forbert moved to New York City in 1976 to experience the punk rock scene of the 1970s. There he performed on the street to passersby in Greenwich Village, and had early shows as a singer with a guitar and harmonica at punk club CBGB before moving on to folk venues Kenny&#x27;s Castaways and Folk City.

==Musical career==
Forbert signed a recording contract with Nemperor in 1978, and they released his debut album &quot;Alive on Arrival&quot; that year. While some, like &quot;Village Voice&quot;, called him &quot;the new Dylan,&quot; of any comparison to Bob Dylan, he said, &quot;You can&#x27;t pay any attention to that. It was just a cliché back then, and it&#x27;s nothing I take seriously. I&#x27;m off the hook – I don&#x27;t have to be smarter than everybody else and know all the answers like Bob Dylan.&quot;

Even though the sleeve of his second album &quot;Jackrabbit Slim&quot; stated that &quot;Romeo&#x27;s Tune&quot; is &quot;dedicated to the memory of Florence Ballard&quot;, the song is not really about the Supremes singer who died in 1976. The song, which went to No. 11, was actually written about a girl from Forbert&#x27;s hometown of Meridian, Mississippi, but was dedicated to Ballard because, as Forbert explained, &quot;that seemed like such bad news to me and such sad news. She wasn&#x27;t really taken care of by the music business, which is not a new story.&quot; The piano part on &quot;Romeo&#x27;s Tune&quot; was played by former Elvis Presley pianist Bobby Ogdin.

&quot;Jackrabbit Slim&quot; was recorded completely live at Quadrophonic Studio in Nashville, Tennessee, and the record was produced by John Simon, who had worked with the Band. &quot;Jackrabbit Slim&quot; peaked at No. 54 in the UK Albums Chart. The album reached No. 20 on the Billboard Top 200 album chart.

Forbert also had a cameo appearance in Cyndi Lauper&#x27;s &quot;Girls Just Want To Have Fun&quot; video, playing her boyfriend.

In 1984, Forbert had a disagreement with his record company Nemperor and contractual issues prevented him from recording for a number of years afterwards. His 1988 album, &quot;Streets of This Town&quot;, and the 1992 followup &quot;The American in Me&quot;, were released by Geffen Records. They received significant airplay.

In the years following, Forbert recorded more albums of songs he wrote and sang, accompanied by his guitar. He maintained a constant touring presence as well.

By 1985, Forbert sought out new inspiration and relocated to Nashville. His tribute album to Jimmie Rodgers, &quot;Any Old Time,&quot; was nominated for a 2004 Grammy Award in the Best Traditional Folk category. In 2006, he was inducted into the Mississippi Music Hall of Fame, and in 2007, Keith Urban covered his hit &quot;Romeo&#x27;s Tune.&quot; The same year, Forbert&#x27;s music was featured in the film &quot;Margot at the Wedding&quot; starring Nicole Kidman.

Forbert wrote new music in support of the Occupy Wall St. movement. He also began doing photography using an old LG phone. An exhibit of his cell phone photographs opened at the Tinney Contemporary Art Gallery in Nashville in September 2011.

In 2012, he joined Blue Corn Music, and they released &quot;Over With You&quot;, produced by Chris Goldsmith (the Blind Boys of Alabama), that same year. Musical backing on the record included Ben Sollee on cello and bass, with Ben Harper guesting on guitar on several tracks. &quot;American Songwriter&quot; stated &quot;it&#x27;s all lovely, melancholy, lyrically moving and beautifully performed&quot; and &quot;Like Warren Zevon, Gram Parsons, Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, and Bruce Springsteen, Steve Forbert has left his unmistakable imprint on the landscape of American music.&quot;

After the destruction caused by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, Forbert released a music video, &quot;Sandy,&quot; to raise awareness about the storm and its aftermath.

In 2013, Blue Corn Music re-released Forbert&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;Alive on Arrival&quot; and its gold-certified follow-up &quot;Jackrabbit Slim&quot;. That year marked the 35th anniversary of the release of &quot;Alive on Arrival&quot;, and Forbert played that album in its entirety at a number of shows. &quot;Alive on Arrival&quot; was profiled as one of the greatest debut albums ever in the book &quot;Please Allow Me To Introduce Myself&quot;.

Forbert&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Big City Cat: My Life in Folk-Rock&quot; (PFP Publishing, 2018), was edited by Therese Boyd and released in September 2018. The book covers his four-decade-long career. To accompany the book, at the same time, Forbert released &quot;The Magic Tree&quot; album on Blue Rose Music. The twelve tracks were culled from demos and new material, and builds on his pop and folk rock style. Joining Forbert on &quot;The Magic Tree&quot; is longtime accompanying guitarist Clay Barnes and the album was produced by Karl Derfler.

== Personal life ==
In the early 1980s, Forbert moved to the Asbury Park area of the Jersey Shore. There, he married, had children, and in 2001 divorced. That same year, he renewed a relationship with Diane DeFazio.

In 2017 Forbert received a cancer diagnosis. As a result, he had one kidney removed, received chemotherapy and was able to be diagnosed as cancer free.

<text>Moringen is a town in the district Northeim, in the southern part of Lower Saxony, Germany. The town consists of the center Moringen and eight surrounding villages, Fredelsloh being one of them.

==History==
The town and its villages were founded over a thousand years ago.

It is the seat of a psychiatric hospital, founded in late 19th century. During World War II the hospital was emptied and used by the Nazis as the Moringen concentration camp. Today it is again a psychiatric hospital.

==Economy==
Among the larger firms operating in the community is Piller, a maker of industrial fans. The Northeim district&#x27;s major waste landfill is in Moringen.

<text>Sarcoptes scabiei (/sɑː&quot;r&quot;ˈkɒptiːz skeɪˈbiːaɪ/ Traditional English pronunciation of Latin) or the itch mite is a parasitic mite found in all parts of the world that burrows into skin and causes scabies. Humans become infested by &quot;Sarcoptes scabiei&quot; var. &quot;hominis&quot;; other mammals can be infested with different varieties of the mite. They include wild and domesticated dogs and cats (in which it is one cause of mange), ungulates, wild boars, bovids, wombats, koalas, and great apes.
The Italian biologists Giovanni Cosimo Bonomo and Diacinto Cestoni showed in the 17th century that scabies is caused by &quot;Sarcoptes scabiei&quot;; this discovery of the itch mite in 1687 marked scabies as the first disease of humans with a known microscopic causative agent. The disease produces intense, itchy skin rashes when the impregnated female tunnels into the stratum corneum of the skin and deposits eggs in the burrow. The larvae, which hatch in three to 10 days, move about on the skin, moult into a nymphal stage, and then mature into adult mites. The adult mites live three to four weeks in the host&#x27;s skin.

==Clinical significance==
The action of the mites moving within the skin and on the skin itself produces an intense itch that may resemble other types of allergic reaction in appearance. A delayed Type IV hypersensitivity reaction to the mites, their eggs, or scybala (packets of feces) occurs approximately 30 days after infestation. The presence of the eggs produces a massive allergic response that, in turn, produces more itching. Individuals who already are sensitized from a prior infestation can develop symptoms within hours.

&quot;Sarcoptes&quot; is a genus of skin parasites, and part of the larger family of mites collectively known as &quot;scab mites&quot;. They are also related to the scab mite &quot;Psoroptes&quot;, also a mite that infests the skin of domestic animals. Sarcoptic mange affects domestic animals and similar infestations in domestic fowls cause the disease known as &quot;scaly leg&quot;. The effects of &quot;S. scabiei&quot; are the most well-known, causing &quot;scabies&quot;, or &quot;the itch&quot;. The adult female mite, having been fertilized, burrows into the skin (usually at the hands or wrists, but other parts of the body may also be affected), and lays its eggs.

The burrowing is carried out using the mouth parts and special cutting surfaces on the front legs. While these are being used, the mite anchors itself with suckers on its feet. Eggs are laid in small numbers as the mite burrows, and, as these hatch, six-legged larvae climb out on to the skin and search for hair follicles, where they feed and moult (discard old cuticles to grow). In the hair follicles, the larvae show the first nymphal stages, with eight legs.

In the nymphal stages, the creature feeds and moults, and if male, gives rise to the adult. In the case of females, another moult occurs before adulthood. The female has more moults than a male, so takes longer—17 days compared to 9 to 11 days for a male—to reach adulthood. The female is about twice the size of the male.

Although the life-cycle is only about two weeks, individual patients are seldom found to have more than about a dozen mites on them. Even so, this number can cause agonising itching, especially at night, and severe damage to the skin often comes as a result of scratching, in particular by the introduction of infective bacteria, which may lead to impetigo or eczema.

The eggs are laid by the female at a rate of about two to three eggs a day for about two months. About 2% of the British population is thought to be infested with these mites, which take about 25 minutes to an hour to burrow into the skin. 

The best conditions in which to harbor &quot;S. scabiei&quot; is in areas with frequent skin-to-skin contact, such as the hands and wrists, as the mites are transmitted by skin contact with carriers, and they very easily spread. Infestations of &quot;S. scabiei&quot; are commonly found in pigs. They significantly depress growth and feeding rate, but usually die out in around five days in typical farm conditions. However, once in a herd, the mites are very difficult to eliminate without great measures taken.

==Morphology==

Adult scabies mites are spherical, eyeless mites with four pairs of legs (two pairs in front and two pairs behind). They are recognizable by their oval, ventrally flattened and dorsally convex tortoise-like bodies and multiple cuticular spines. No demarcation into cephalothorax or abdomen occurs, and the mite&#x27;s surface has folds covered with short bristles. The front legs end in long, tubular processes known as suckers, and the hind legs end in long bristles. The male has suckers on all legs except the third pair, which distinguishes it from the female. Females are long and wide, and males are just over half that size.

==Life cycle==
The scabies mite &quot;Sarcoptes scabiei&quot; var. &quot;hominis&quot; goes through four stages in its lifecycle: egg, larva, nymph, and adult.

Upon infesting a human host, the adult female burrows into the &quot;stratum corneum&quot; (outermost layer of skin), where she deposits two or three eggs per day. These oval eggs are long and hatch as larvae in three to four days. A female can lay up to 30 eggs, then dies at the end of a burrow. Upon hatching, the six-legged larvae migrate to the skin surface and then burrow into molting pouches, usually into hair follicles, where vesicles form (these are shorter and smaller than the adult burrows). After three to four days, the larvae molt, turning into eight-legged nymphs. This form molts a second time into slightly larger nymphs, before a final molt into adult mites. Adult mites then mate when the male penetrates the molting pouch of the female. Mating occurs only once, as that one event leaves the female infertile for the rest of her life (one to two months). The impregnated female then leaves the molting pouch in search of a suitable location for a permanent burrow. Once a site is found, the female creates her characteristic S-shaped burrow, laying eggs in the process. The female will continue lengthening her burrow and laying eggs for the duration of her life.

<text>Balbina Steffenone (also spelled Bina or Steffanone or Steffenoni, 1825–1896) was a 19th-century soprano.

Born in Turin, Kingdom of Sardinia, she studied in Bologna under Teresa Bertinotti, debuting as Lucia in &quot;Macerata&quot; in 1842. After singing across Italy, she spent the years 1845 to 1847 singing at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, then went to North America, where she stayed for seven years. Her appearances ranged from Boston to Mexico City and Havana, where she remained a principal in the company under Giovanni Bottesini around 1850 with whom she was involved in the second performance of the National Anthem of Mexico in September 1854.

She sang in the American premiere of &quot;Il trovatore&quot; at the Academy of Music in New York, sharing the roles of Leonora and Ines in the production. On her return from Cuba in 1855, when she played Lucrezia Borgia in the opera, &quot;The New York Times&quot; called her &quot;one of the few worth welcoming back again&quot;; but critic Richard Grant White wrote that her voice had deteriorated into &quot;a bewildered shriek&quot;.

She continued her career in Europe, appearing in Vienna in 1859 and Naples in 1860–61, where she created Errico Petrella&#x27;s &quot;Morosina&quot;. She is reported to have retired in 1862, but also to have taken part in the première of Vincenzo Battista&#x27;s &quot;Giovanna di Castiglia&quot; at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples in 1863.

She died in Naples in 1896.

<text>Baloo (from &quot;bhālū&quot; &quot;bear&quot;) is a main fictional character featured in Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; from 1894 and &quot;The Second Jungle Book&quot; from 1895. Baloo, a sloth bear, is the strict teacher of the cubs of the Seeonee wolf pack. His most challenging pupil is the &quot;man-cub&quot; Mowgli. Baloo and Bagheera, the panther, save Mowgli from Shere Khan, the tiger, and endeavour to teach Mowgli the Law of the Jungle in many of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; stories.

==Name and species==
He is described in Kipling&#x27;s work as &quot;the sleepy brown bear&quot;. Robert Armitage Sterndale, from whom Kipling derived most of his knowledge of Indian fauna, used the Hindi word &quot;Bhalu&quot; for several bear species, though Daniel Karlin, who edited the Penguin reissue of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; in 1987, states that, with the exception of colour, Kipling&#x27;s descriptions of Baloo are consistent with the sloth bear, as brown and Asian black bears do not occur in the Seoni area where the story takes place. Also, the name &quot;sloth&quot; can be used in the context of sleepiness. Karlin states, however, that Baloo&#x27;s diet of &quot;only roots and nuts and honey&quot; is a trait more common to the Asian black bear than to the sloth bear. Nevertheless, this may be single observation only; according to the dietary habits of sloth bears, while sloth bears prefer termites and ants (which is also described as Baloo&#x27;s special treat in &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;), their main sources of food are honey and fruits most of the year. In the 1967 Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, he&#x27;s portrayed as a sloth bear, while in the Russian version, he&#x27;s portrayed as an Asian black bear. In the 1994 remake of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, Baloo is depicted as a cinnamon bear, while live-action television shows and films often have Baloo as an American black bear. In the 2016 adaptation, Baloo is stated to be a sloth bear by Bagheera, though his appearance is similar to that of a Himalayan brown bear. Though this subspecies of the brown bear is absent from historical records on Seoni, it might have ranged across most of northern India.

Another possibility is that this character was named after Balochistan Bear, a sub-species of Asiatic black bear, which can be found around Baluchistan mountain range of Pakistan and India. Another strong supporting fact to this theory is that Balochistan bears love to eat bananas and other fruits. In several scenes of the &quot;Jungle Book&quot;, Baloo is shown to be eating bananas and prickly pears.

==Pronunciation==
In the &quot;Author&#x27;s Notes in the Jungle Books&quot;, Kipling gives the pronunciation of the name as ; although it is also commonly pronounced .

==In film, television, and theatre==
===Disney versions===
Baloo, based on Kipling&#x27;s creation, has appeared in various Disney productions, starting with the company&#x27;s 1967 feature-length animated film adaptation of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;. In this version, Baloo (voiced by Phil Harris) is portrayed as a friendly, even-tempered character who lives a responsibility-free lifestyle, seemingly far removed from the law teacher in Kipling&#x27;s book. Like in the novel, Baloo is one of Mowgli&#x27;s mentors and friends. Baloo is also patient and strong; his only apparent weakness is that he&#x27;s ticklish. Baloo is initially opposed to bringing Mowgli to the Man Village, wanting to raise him as a son. However, when Bagheera explains that Mowgli is easy prey for Shere Khan the tiger and that he&#x27;s not safe in the jungle, even with Baloo&#x27;s diligent protection, Baloo realizes he has a point and agrees to tell Mowgli the difficult truth. Mowgli turns on Baloo and runs away, prompting him and Bagheera to split up and search for the boy. Baloo isn&#x27;t seen again until the climax of the film, when he sees Mowgli preparing to battle Shere Khan. Baloo attempts to stop the tiger, but almost gets killed in the process. After Mowgli follows a girl into the village and decides to stay there, Baloo is slightly disappointed, but is ultimately relieved that Mowgli is safe at last. He and Bagheera then return to the jungle as they sing a reprise of &quot;The Bare Necessities&quot; together.

Baloo returns in the 2003 animated sequel &quot;The Jungle Book 2&quot; in which he is voiced by John Goodman. He is eager to reunite with Mowgli, in spite of Bagheera&#x27;s exasperation and the return of a vindictive Shere Khan, humiliated by his previous defeat at Mowgli&#x27;s hands. He sneaks into the Man Village at night after eluding Bagheera and Colonel Hathi&#x27;s herd to visit Mowgli and takes him off into the jungle after being caught by the village girl, now given the name Shanti, who felt bad for getting Mowgli in trouble and unknowingly saves him from Shere Khan, who also came to the village. This leads Shanti, Ranjan, and some of the other villagers to go into the jungle to search for him. Mowgli tells Baloo all about the negative aspects of the village while hiding the positive feelings he also has about the place. When Baloo makes fun of Mowgli&#x27;s life in the village and scares Shanti like Mowgli asked him to, he unintentionally hurts Mowgli&#x27;s feelings and annoys him. Baloo and Shanti continue to hate each other until they both say they&#x27;re trying to save Mowgli from Shere Khan (who ambushed Mowgli when he went after Shanti and Ranjan to apologize) during an argument. From then on, they acknowledge one another as friends. After he, Mowgli, and Shanti trap Shere Khan under a statue on a rocky outcrop in a lava lake, Baloo understands that Mowgli&#x27;s place is in the village and sadly says good-bye to him. However, it is revealed the next day that Mowgli, Shanti, and Ranjan have the village leader&#x27;s permission to visit the jungle as they please (presumably because, with Shere Khan gone, the jungle is now &quot;certified as safe&quot;). The film ends with Baloo, Shanti, and Mowgli singing a reprise of &quot;The Bare Necessities&quot; while Ranjan plays with Bagheera.

Baloo became a popular character after the success of the Disney films. He was made famous by the song &quot;The Bare Necessities&quot;, sung by Phil Harris, in which he tells Mowgli how to live off the land and still have a life of luxury.

In a 1978 live-action sketch titled &quot;The Wonderful World of Ernie&quot; from &quot;Morecambe and Wise&quot;, which parodied &quot;I Wan&#x27;na Be Like You (The Monkey Song)&quot;, Baloo is played by Eric Morecambe using a full costume, although lip-synching to Phil Harris&#x27;s original recording.

====&quot;TaleSpin&quot; (1990–1991)====
In the 1990 Disney animated TV series &quot;TaleSpin&quot;, Baloo (voiced by Ed Gilbert) is the main character of the series and is based primarily on the character from Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, but he wears a flight cap and a khaki shirt. He&#x27;s also more humanoid in appearance as he has four-fingered hands as opposed to his &quot;Jungle Book&quot; rendition&#x27;s claws. He has an easy-going and cheeky personality just like the &quot;Jungle Book&quot; version. Although juvenile, scruffy, directionless, and a slacker, he is also an excellent pilot and capable of dangerous aerial maneuvers. He flies a cargo plane called the &quot;Sea Duck&quot;. He will also bravely come to the aid of people in need of help. Some of his mannerisms survive from &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, including his nickname of &quot;Papa Bear&quot;, and he also calls his young sidekick, Kit Cloudkicker &quot;Little Britches&quot; much like he did to Mowgli.

====1994 live-action film====
In the 1994 Disney live-action film version of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, Baloo, like all the other animals featured, does not speak. He is portrayed by an American black bear named Casey. He first meets Mowgli as a cub when Mowgli finds him trapped inside a broken log. Mowgli frees him and they become fast friends. In a later scene, while Mowgli is escorting his childhood sweetheart Katherine &quot;Kitty&quot; Brydon through the jungle, Baloo appears and playfully wrestles with Mowgli, in the process temporarily scaring Kitty until Mowgli introduces his jungle friends to her. In a later tussle against soldiers working for Captain William Boone, Baloo is shot and left for dead, but Mowgli finds him and locates Dr. Julius Plumford to save his life. In the final scene, after Boone&#x27;s defeat, Dr. Plumford is shown to have successfully saved Baloo and is seen standing with Baloo beside a waterfall.

====&quot;Jungle Cubs&quot; (1996–1998)====
In the 1996 Disney animated TV series &quot;Jungle Cubs&quot;, Baloo (voiced by Pamela Adlon) is a kind-hearted and genial cub. He likes to play with his friends (including his best friend Louie) and sometimes plays tricks on Bagheera in order to snap the latter out of his serious attitude. Ed Gilbert voices the character as an adult on three animated segments featured on the VHS releases of the series.

====&quot;The Jungle Book: Mowgli&#x27;s Story&quot; (1998)====
Baloo appears in the 1998 live-action film &quot;The Jungle Book: Mowgli&#x27;s Story&quot;, voiced by Brian-Doyle Murray. His role in the film is similar to the 1967 animated version, but like the original novel, he also becomes Mowgli&#x27;s teacher (alongside Bagheera) in which he teaches him how to hunt in the jungle and defend against Shere Khan.

====Stage adaptation (2013)====
Disney&#x27;s 2013 stage adaptation of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, directed by Mary Zimmerman, features Kevin Carolan as Baloo.

====&quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (2016)====
In the 2016 version of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, Baloo is voiced by Bill Murray, and appears as a Himalayan brown bear, although Bagheera mockingly refers to him as a sloth bear. Baloo claims to hibernate, which would suggest a brown bear, but Bagheera gets him to admit that he just &quot;naps a lot&quot;.

Baloo first appears when Kaa is about to devour Mowgli and rescues him from the python before she can eat him. Baloo then takes Mowgli back to his cave and tells him to help him gather honey in exchange for saving his life. Eventually, Baloo and Mowgli form a strong attachment with Mowgli deciding that he wants to stay with Baloo until the winter season arrives. When Bagheera shows up, Mowgli reveals that he wants to live with Baloo. Baloo then speaks with Bagheera, and Baloo reluctantly agrees to send Mowgli away to the Man-village so he is safe from Shere Khan. To this end, he says he and Mowgli were never friends, hoping his lie will coerce Mowgli into going to the Man-village. However, before Mowgli can decide, monkeys under the command of King Louie, a &quot;gigantopithecus&quot;, abduct him. Baloo and Bagheera track the monkeys back to their temple and fight them off long enough for Mowgli to hide from Louie. The ensuing chase results in Louie&#x27;s apparent death. When Mowgli learns of Akela&#x27;s death by Shere Khan from Louie, he angrily decides to face Shere Khan, and steals a torch from the man-village, accidentally starting a fire in the jungle. Baloo and Bagheera follow him in close pursuit and help to distract Shere Khan alongside Raksha and the rest of Mowgli&#x27;s wolf pack so that Mowgli can set a trap that later kills Shere Khan. After Shere Khan is defeated and the fire extinguished, Mowgli is last seen sometime later with Baloo and Bagheera, having at last found his true home in the jungle.

====&quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot;====
Baloo makes a cameo appearance in the 2022 film &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot;, where he was voiced by Steven Curtis Chapman. In the film, it was stated that he was originally from &quot;TaleSpin&quot; before appearing in &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; reboot.

====&quot;Once Upon a Studio&quot;====
In the 2023 short &quot;Once Upon a Studio&quot;, Baloo is shown with Mowgli singing the verses for the song &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot;. In the short he is voiced by Jim Cummings who previously voiced him in an animated non-Disney version of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; released by GoodTime Video in 1990.

===Japanese anime (1989)===
In 1989 Japanese anime television series &quot;Jungle Book Shōnen Mowgli&quot;, also based on &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, Baloo (voiced by Banjō Ginga in Japanese and A.J. Henderson in the English dub) is more faithfully depicted as a strict teacher of Mowgli, not above getting physical in his displeasure when the boy is being difficult. Like his Disney self, he is a sloth bear by species. In the episode &quot;The Cold Fang&quot;, Akela reveals that Baloo lost his mother and sibling to a pack of Dholes, which became the reason for his serious nature.

===Live action series (1998)===
In the live-action TV series &quot;&quot; based on the original &quot;Jungle Book&quot; stories, Baloo is once again given a more sensible personality faithful to that of the books.

===2010 animated series (2010–2020)===
In the Indian animated TV series &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, Baloo (voiced by Jimmy Hibbert and David Willis) is once again given a more conservative personality faithful to that of the books. He is also depicted in this series as wearing glasses and, like his Disney self, as a tall and obese himalayan brown bear with a bipedal gait.

===&quot;Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle&quot; (2018 film)===
In the 2018 live-action film &quot;&quot;, Baloo was voiced and motion-captured by Andy Serkis who also served as the film&#x27;s director. Like his book counterpart, Baloo serves as Mowgli&#x27;s primary teacher. Serkis has also described this incarnation of Baloo as almost being akin to a drill sergeant who pushes Mowgli to understand the rules of the jungle. When teaching Mowgli, he often advises him not to interact with the Bandar-log. When Mowgli is attacked near the finish line by Bagheera during the rite of passage, Baloo calls him off before it goes too far. Though Mowgli says that Bagheera cut him off, Baloo advises Mowgli not to let his guard down, meaning he had still failed. After Mowgli leaves upset, Baloo furiously scolds Bagheera for being too aggressive and cutting into the test; Bagheera revealed that he failed Mowgli on purpose so that he would go to the man village to be safe from Shere Khan. Baloo, feeling that Bagheera betrayed Mowgli and caused him to fail in being a teacher to him, gets into a physical altercation with the panther, saying that Bagheera was not the only one to care about Mowgli and showing underneath the gruff exterior, the bear did care. Both stop their fighting however when Bhoot, Mowgli&#x27;s albino wolf cub friend, informs them that the Bandar-log had made off with Mowgli. The two of them manage to rescue Mowgli from the Bandar-log, Shere Khan, and Tabaqui with the help of Kaa. When Akela orders Mowgli to leave the lair after he used fire to drive off Shere Khan and Tabaqui, Baloo is saddened to see him go. In the climax of the film, Baloo is among the animals that witness Mowgli&#x27;s duel with Shere Khan outside the man village which ends with the death of Shere Khan.

<text>Helen O&#x27;Connell (May 23, 1920 – September 9, 1993) was an American singer, actress, and hostess, described as &quot;the quintessential big band singer of the 1940s&quot;.

==Early life==
Born in Lima, Ohio, O&#x27;Connell grew up in Toledo, Ohio. By the time she was 15, she and her older sister, Alice, were singing duets in clubs and hotels and on radio stations in Toledo.

==Career==
O&#x27;Connell launched her career as a big-band singer with Larry Funk and his Band of a Thousand Melodies. She was singing with Funk&#x27;s band in Greenwich Village when Jimmy Dorsey&#x27;s manager discovered her.

O&#x27;Connell joined the Dorsey band in 1939 and achieved her best selling records in the early 1940s with &quot;Green Eyes&quot;, &quot;Amapola&quot;, &quot;Tangerine&quot; and &quot;Yours&quot;. In each of these Latin-influenced numbers, Bob Eberly crooned the song which Helen then reprised in an up-tempo arrangement. O&#x27;Connell was selected by &quot;DownBeat&quot; readers as best female singer in 1940 and 1941 and won the 1940 &quot;Metronome&quot; magazine poll for best female vocalist. In a 1993 obituary article, the Associated Press described O&#x27;Connell as &quot;the darling of GIs during World War II&quot;.

O&#x27;Connell retired from show business upon her first marriage in 1943. When her marriage ended in 1951, she resumed her career, achieving some chart success and making regular appearances on radio and television. O&#x27;Connell sang duets with Bing Crosby, Johnny Mercer, and Dean Martin. In 1953, O&#x27;Connell and Bob Eberly headlined &quot;TV&#x27;s Top Tunes&quot;, a summer replacement program for Perry Como&#x27;s CBS television show. The program also featured Ray Anthony and his orchestra. In March 1955 O&#x27;Connell visited Australia as a support act on the landmark tour headlined by singer Johnnie Ray, which set a new box office record for Australia that stood until the 1964 visit by The Beatles (and during which local media also reported that O&#x27;Connell was romantically linked with Ray). O&#x27;Connell also was the featured singer on &quot;The Russ Morgan Show&quot; on CBS TV in 1956. In 1957, she had her own 15-minute program, &quot;The Helen O&#x27;Connell Show&quot;, twice a week on NBC.

O&#x27;Connell was one of the first &quot;girls&quot; on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Today Show&quot;, commenting at the time: &quot;I wasn&#x27;t hired as a singer, I was hired as a talker, a pleasant switch.&quot; She had that role from 1956 to 1958.

In 1961, she co-hosted the Desilu-NBC program &quot;Here&#x27;s Hollywood&quot;, conducting interviews with celebrities, often in their own homes. O&#x27;Connell co-hosted the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants with Bob Barker from 1972 to 1980 and was nominated for an Emmy Award in 1976 for her coverage of the Miss Universe pageant. . She also sang the National Anthem for Super Bowl XV in 1981. O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s 1942 recording of &quot;Brazil&quot; with the Jimmy Dorsey Orchestra was a 2009 addition to the Grammy Hall of Fame.

In 1977, O&#x27;Connell was invited to join the &quot;4 Girls 4&quot; show comprising Rosemary Clooney, Margaret Whiting and Rose Marie. The format was that each member performed solo for 30 minutes and finally they all joined up together to sing as a group for about ten minutes. The act was very successful for several years and toured all over the USA. Whiting and Rose Marie left the group and were replaced by Martha Raye and Kay Starr with the show being renamed The New 4 Girls. The group finally disbanded in 1989.

In 1992, O&#x27;Connell was featured along with The Andrews Sisters and Kay Starr in the KCET special &quot;Those Fabulous 40s&quot;. Her final performance was at the Valley Forge Music Festival in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, on August 14, 1993.
