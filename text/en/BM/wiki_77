<text>The Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) is a species of bottlenose dolphin. This dolphin grows to long, and weighs up to . It lives in the waters around India, northern Australia, South China, the Red Sea, and the eastern coast of Africa. Its back is dark grey and its belly is lighter grey or nearly white with grey spots.

The Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin is generally smaller than the common bottlenose dolphin, has a proportionately longer rostrum, and has spots on its belly and lower sides. It also has more teeth than the common bottlenose dolphin — 23 to 29 teeth on each side of each jaw compared to 21 to 24 for the common bottlenose dolphin.

Much of the old scientific data in the field combine data about the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin and the common bottlenose dolphin into a single group, making it effectively useless in determining the structural differences between the two species. The IUCN lists the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin as &quot;near threatened&quot; in their Red List of endangered species.

== Taxonomy ==
Until 1998, all bottlenose dolphins were considered members of the single species &quot;T. truncatus&quot;. But in that year, the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin was recognized as a separate species. Both species are thought to have split during the mid-Pleistocene, about 1 million years ago.

Some evidence shows the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin may actually be more closely related to certain dolphin species in the genera &quot;Stenella&quot; and &quot;Delphinus&quot;, especially the Atlantic spotted dolphin (&quot;S. frontalis&quot;), than it is to the common bottlenose dolphin. However, more recent studies indicate that this is a consequence of reticulate evolution (such as past hybridization between &quot;Stenella&quot; and ancestral &quot;Tursiops&quot;) and incomplete lineage sorting, and thus support &quot;T&quot;. &quot;truncatus&quot; and &quot;T. aduncus&quot; belonging to the same genus.

The Burrunan dolphin (&quot;T. (aduncus) australis&quot;) has been alternately considered its own species, a subspecies of &quot;T. truncatus&quot;, or a subspecies of &quot;T. aduncus&quot;. Following the results of a 2020 study, the American Society of Mammalogists presently classifies it as a subspecies of &quot;T. aduncus&quot;. The same study delineated 3 distinct lineages within &quot;T. aduncus&quot; which could each be their own subspecies: an Indian Ocean lineage, an Australasian lineage, and the Burrunan dolphin. The Society for Marine Mammalogy does not recognize the Burrunan dolphin as a distinct species or subspecies, citing the need for further research.

==Description==
Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins are very similar to common bottlenose dolphins in appearance. Common bottlenose dolphins have a reasonably strong body, moderate-length beak, and tall, curved dorsal fins; whereas Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins have a more slender body build and their beak is longer and more slender. The Indo-Pacific population also tends to have a somewhat lighter blue colour and the cape is generally more distinct, with a light spinal blaze extending to below the dorsal fin. However, although not always present, the most obvious distinction can be made with the presence of black spots or flecks on the bellies of adults of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins, which are very rare in common bottlenose dolphins. Their teeth can number between 23 and 29 in each upper and lower jaw, and are more slender than those of common bottlenose dolphins. Size of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins can vary based on geographic location; however, its average length is long, and it weighs up to . The length at birth is between .

The local population centering Mikura-jima is claimed to be a distinct form or species.

==Diet==
Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins feed on a wide variety of fish and cephalopods (particularly squid).

In one study, researchers looked at the feeding ecology of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins by analyzing the stomach contents of ones that got caught in the gillnet fisheries off Zanzibar, Tanzania. The prey items found in the stomach contents included 50 species of bony fish and three species of squid. From their results, the researchers concluded the most important prey group was fish, which accounted for 87% of the total number of prey items consumed and occurred in 24 of 26 stomachs examined. Cephalopods comprised the other 13% of prey items and were found in 13 of the 26 stomachs. The remains of some crustaceans were also found; they hypothesize, however, they were consumed secondarily, since a number were found intact in the fish prey stomachs and therefore were not included in the diet analysis.

==Behavior==

Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins live in groups that can number in the hundreds, but groups of five to 15 dolphins are most common. In some parts of their range, they associate with the common bottlenose dolphin and other dolphin species, such as the humpback dolphin.

The peak mating and calving seasons are in the spring and summer, although mating and calving occur throughout the year in some regions. The gestation period is about 12 months. Calves are between long, and weigh between . The calves are weaned between 1.5 and 2.0 years, but can remain with their mothers for up to 5 years. The interbirth interval for females is typically 4.5 to 6 years.

In some parts of its range, this dolphin is subject to predation by sharks; its lifespan is more than 40 years.

Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins located in Shark Bay, Australia, have been observed using sponges as tools in a practice called &quot;sponging&quot;. A dolphin breaks a marine sponge off the sea floor and wears it over its rostrum, apparently to probe substrates for fish, possibly as a tool.

The first report and footage of spontaneous ejaculation in an aquatic mammal was recorded in a wild Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin near Mikura Island, Japan, in 2012.

Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins have been observed to swim near and rub themselves against specific types of corals and sponges. A team of scientists followed up on this behavior and discovered metabolites with antibacterial, antioxidative, and hormonal activities in the corals and sponges, suggesting that they might be used by the dolphins to treat skin infections.

==Status and threats==
The species is not considered to be endangered; its near-shore distribution, though, makes it vulnerable to environmental degradation, direct exploitation, and problems associated with local fisheries.

The major predators of this species are typically sharks, and may include humans, killer whales (&quot;Orcinus orca&quot;), and stingrays. In the early 1980s, many were deliberately killed in a Taiwanese driftnet fishery in the Arafura Sea, off northwestern Australia. Large-mesh nets set to protect bathers from sharks in South Africa and Australia have also resulted in a substantial number of deaths. Gillnets are also having an impact, and are a problem throughout most of the species&#x27; range.

==Captivity==
These small cetaceans are commonly found in captivity, causing conservation concerns, including the effects of removing the animals from their wild populations, survival of cetaceans during capture and transport and while in captivity, and the risks to wild populations and ecosystems of accidentally introducing alien species and spreading epizootic diseases, especially when animals have been transported over long distances and are held in sea pens.

Bottlenose dolphins are the most common captive cetaceans on a global scale. Prior to 1980, more than 1,500 bottlenose dolphins were collected from the United States, Mexico, and the Bahamas, and more than 550 common and 60 Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins were brought into captivity in Japan. By the late 1980s, the United States stopped collecting bottlenose dolphins and the number of captive-born animals in North American aquaria has increased from only 6% in 1976 to about 44% in 1996.

In the South Korea, in the 2010s, environmental groups and animal protection groups led a campaign (2013년 대한민국 남방큰돌고래 방사) to release southern bottlenose dolphins illegally captured by fishermen and trapped in Jeju Pacific Land and Seoul Zoo.

In 2019, Canada banned the trade, possession, capture, and breeding of whales, dolphins, and porpoises for entertainment through passing Bill-203, also known as the &quot;Ending the Captivity of Whales and Dolphins Act&quot;. 
===Japan===
In a study on three populations of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins in Japan, the characteristics of acoustic signals are believed to be affected by the acoustic environments among habitats, and geographical variation in animal acoustic signals can result from differences in acoustic environments; therefore, the characteristics of the ambient noise in the dolphins&#x27; habitats and the whistles produced were compared. Ambient noise was recorded using a hydrophone located 10 m below the surface and whistles were recorded by using an underwater video system.

The results showed dolphins produced whistles at varying frequencies with greater modulations when in habitats with less ambient noise, whereas habitats with greater ambient noise seem to cause dolphins to produce whistles of lower frequencies and fewer frequency modulations. Examination of the results suggest communication signals are adaptive and are selected to avoid the masking of signals and the decrease of higher-frequency signals. They concluded ambient noise has the potential to drive the variation in whistles of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin populations.

===Jervis Bay, Australia===
Small, motorized vessels have increased as a source of anthropogenic noise due to the rise in popularity of wildlife viewing such as whale watching. Another study showed powerboat approaches within 100 m altered the dolphin surface behaviour from traveling to milling, and changed their direction to travel away from the powerboat. When the powerboat left the area and its noise ceased, the dolphins returned to their preceding behaviour in the original direction.

===Shark Bay, Australia===

Another study in Shark Bay, Western Australia, on dolphin behavioural responses showed significant changes in the behaviour of targeted dolphins were found when compared with their behaviour before and after approaches by small watercraft. Dolphins in the low-traffic site showed a stronger and longer-lasting response than dolphins in the high-traffic site. These results are believed to show habituation of the dolphins to the vessels in a region of long-term vessel traffic. However, when compared to other studies in the same area, moderated responses, rather, were suggested to be because those individuals sensitive to vessel disturbance left the region before their study began.

Although these studies do show statistical significance for the effects of whale-watching boats on behavior, what these results mean for long-term population viability is not known. The Shark Bay population has been forecast to be relatively stable with little variation in mortality over time (Manlik &quot;et al.&quot; 2016).

==Conservation==
The Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin populations of the Arafura and the Timor Sea are listed on Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). They are listed on Appendix II as they have an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organised by tailored agreements.

The Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin is also covered by Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MoU). The population of the Menai Bay Conservation Area in the Zanzibar Archipelago of Tanzania has been researched.

The Adelaide Dolphin Sanctuary is a marine protected area in the Australian state of South Australia located on the east coast of Gulf St Vincent, which was established in 2005 for the protection of a resident population of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins.

<doc id="422546" wikidata="Q5593784" url="?curid=422546" title="Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal">
<text>The Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal was awarded from 1970 to 2011. The award has had several minor name changes:
* In 1970 the award was known as Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group
* From 1971 to 1981 it was awarded as Best Country Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group
* From 1982 to 2011 it was awarded as Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal

The award was discontinued after the 2011 Grammy Awards in a major overhaul of Grammy categories. Since 2012, all duo or group performances in the country category were shifted to the newly formed [[Best Country Duo/Group Performance]] category.

Years reflect the year in which the Grammy Awards were presented, for works released in the previous year.

==Multiple winners==
Both Dixie Chicks and The Judds won five awards in the category. Other multiple winners include Alison Krauss and Union Station, and Emmylou Harris who won three apiece, and Asleep at the Wheel, Brooks and Dunn, Alabama, Rita Coolidge &amp; Kris Kristofferson and Lady Antebellum each of which won two.

<text>The Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals was an honor presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, to quality country music collaborations for artists who do not normally perform together. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

Originally called the Best Country Vocal Performance, Duet, the award was first presented to Kenny Rogers and Ronnie Milsap at the 30th Grammy Awards in 1988 for the single &quot;Make No Mistake, She&#x27;s Mine&quot;. The next year, the category&#x27;s name was changed to Best Country Vocal Collaboration, a name it held until 1996 when it was awarded as the Best Country Collaboration with Vocals. In 2011, the category was merged with the Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and the Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance, forming the Grammy Award for Best Country Duo/Group Performance in order to &quot;tighten the number of categories&quot; at the Grammy Awards.

Alison Krauss holds the record for having the most wins in this category, with a total of five. She is followed by seven others, who have all won the award twice. Among the most nominated are Emmylou Harris and Willie Nelson, both nine-time nominees. Krauss was nominated eight times, while Dolly Parton was a seven-time hopeful. Nominated bands include 1996 winners Shenandoah, a five-man country music band, three-time nominees the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, as well as one of the award&#x27;s final recipients, the Zac Brown Band.

<text>The Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance was awarded from 1970 to 2011. Between 1986 and 1989 the award was presented as the Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance (Orchestra, Group or Soloist).

In 2012 the award was discontinued in a major overhaul of Grammy categories. From 2012, the best instrumental performances in the country category were shifted to either the [[Best Country Solo Performance]] or [[Best Country Duo/Group Performance]] categories, both newly formed.

<doc id="422556" wikidata="Q2436364" url="?curid=422556" title="Cid Corman">
<text>Cid (Sidney) Corman (June 29, 1924 – March 12, 2004) was an American poet, translator and editor, most notably of &quot;Origin&quot;, who was a key figure in the history of American poetry in the second half of the 20th century.

==Life==

Corman was born in Boston&#x27;s Roxbury neighborhood and grew up nearby in the Dorchester neighborhood. His parents were both from Ukraine. From an early age he was an avid reader and showed an aptitude for drawing and calligraphy. He attended Boston Latin School and in 1941 he entered Tufts University, where he achieved Phi Beta Kappa honours and wrote his first poems. He was excused from service in World War II for medical reasons and graduated in 1945.

Corman studied for his Master&#x27;s degree at the University of Michigan, where he won the Hopwood poetry award, but dropped out two credits short of completion. After a brief stint at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, he spent some time travelling around the United States, returning to Boston in 1948.

==Career==
===Early work===

Corman&#x27;s first book, Subluna, was privately printed in 1944. He ran poetry events in public libraries and, with the help of his high-school friend Nat Hentoff, he started the country&#x27;s first poetry radio program.

In 1952, Corman wrote: &quot;I initiated my weekly broadcasts, known as &quot;This Is Poetry&quot;, from WMEX (1510 kc.) in Boston. The program has been usually a fifteen-minute reading of modern verse on Saturday evenings at seven thirty; however, I have taken some liberties and have read from Moby Dick and from stories by Dylan Thomas, Robert Creeley, and Joyce.&quot;

This program featured readings by Robert Creeley, Stephen Spender, Theodore Roethke and many other Boston-based and visiting poets. He also spent some time at the Yaddo artists&#x27; retreat in Saratoga Springs. It was about this time that Corman changed his name from Sydney Corman to the simpler &quot;Cid.&quot; As Corman indicated in conversation, this name change—similar to Walt Whitman&#x27;s assumption of Walt over Walter—signaled his beginnings as a poet for the common man.

During this period, Corman was writing prolifically and published in excess of 500 poems in about 100 magazines by 1954. He considered this to be a kind of apprenticeship, and none of these poems were ever published in book form.

===&quot;Origin&quot; and Europe===

In 1951, Corman began &quot;Origin&quot; in response to the failure of a magazine that Creeley had planned. The magazine typically featured one writer per issue and ran, with breaks, until the mid-1980s. Poets featured included Robert Creeley, Robert Duncan, Larry Eigner, Denise Levertov, William Bronk, Theodore Enslin, Charles Olson, Louis Zukofsky, Clive Faust (Australian Poet), Gary Snyder, Lorine Niedecker, Wallace Stevens, William Carlos Williams, Paul Blackburn and Frank Samperi. The magazine also led to the establishment of Origin Press, which published books by a similar range of poets as well as by Corman himself and which remains currently active.

In 1954, Corman won a Fulbright Fellowship grant (with an endorsement from Marianne Moore) and moved to France, where he studied for a time at the Sorbonne. He then moved to Italy to teach English in a small town called Matera. By this time, Corman had published a number of small books, but his Italian experiences were to provide the materials for his first major work, &quot;Sun Rock Man&quot; (1962). He also experimented with oral poetry, recording improvised poems on tape. These tapes were later to influence the talk-poems of David Antin, one of the key developments in the emergence of performance poetry.

At this time he produced the first English translations of Paul Celan, even though he didn&#x27;t have the poet&#x27;s approval.

===Japan===

In 1958, Corman got a teaching job in Kyoto through the auspices of Will Petersen or, according to one account, poet Gary Snyder. Here he continued to write and to run &quot;Origin&quot; and in 1959 he published Snyder&#x27;s first book, &quot;Riprap&quot;. He remained in Japan until 1960, when he returned to the States for two years. Back in Japan he married Konishi Shizumi, a Japanese TV news editor. Corman began to translate Japanese poetry, particularly work by Bashō and Kusano Shimpei.

The Cormans spent the years 1980 to 1982 in Boston, where they unsuccessfully tried to establish a number of small businesses. They returned to Kyoto, where they remained, running CC&#x27;s Coffee Shop in Kyoto, &quot;offering poetry and western-style patisserie&quot;.

===Later work===
Corman has been associated with the Beats, Black Mountain poets and Objectivists, mainly through his championing as an editor, publisher and critic. However, he remained independent of all groups and fashions throughout his career.

Michael Carlson, who contributed to &quot;Origins&quot; and corresponded with Corman starting in the 1980s, described Corman&#x27;s correspondence this way: &quot;In the days before email his words came by return post, aerogrammes densely typed to take advantage of every inch of space, or postcards printed in his fine hand. They were encouraging, gossipy, and always challenging; he expected everyone to match his commitment to poetry as a way of life. But they also digressed into other shared enthusiasms: in my case his love of baseball and sumo wrestling, and often into the difficulties of making a living in expensive Japan.&quot;

He was a prolific poet until his final illness, publishing more than 100 books and pamphlets. In 1990, he published the first two volumes of poems entitled, &quot;OF&quot;, running to some 1500 poems. These are mostly new works, not a selection of previously published poems. Volume 3, with a further 750 poems appeared in 1998. Volumes 4 and 5 were published as a single book in 2015 to complete the work. Several collections of wide-ranging essays have been published. His translations (or co-translations) include Bashō&#x27;s &quot;Back Roads to Far Towns&quot;, &quot;Things&quot; by Francis Ponge, poems by Paul Celan and collections of haiku.

Cid Corman did not speak, read, or write Japanese, even though his co-translation with Susumu Kamaike of Bashō&#x27;s &quot;Oku No Hosomichi&quot; (see above) is considered to be one of the most accurate in tone in the English language. Corman also felt himself able to translate from classical Chinese without so much as a minimal understanding of the language.

One of Corman&#x27;s last appearances in the United States was at the 2003 centennial symposium and celebration in southern Wisconsin that honored his friend and fellow poet, Lorine Niedecker. At the time, Corman spoke warmly about his connection to the Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin poet (playing the only known audio tape of Niedecker reading from her works). Niedecker had died in 1970, shortly after Corman had visited her. As he told friends and admirers during the 2003 gathering, Corman had not returned to the Black Hawk Island haunts of Niedecker since that first (and only) visit with Niedecker.

He died in Kyoto, Japan on March 12, 2004 after being hospitalized for a cardiac condition since January 2004.

Holley for research that showed the order of nucleotides in nucleic acids, which carry the genetic code of the cell and control the cell&#x27;s synthesis of proteins. Khorana and Nirenberg were also awarded the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University in the same year.

Born in British India, Khorana served on the faculties of three universities in North America. He became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1966, and received the National Medal of Science in 1987.

==Biography==
Har Gobind Khorana was born to Ganpatrai Khorana and Krishna Devi, in Raipur, a village in Multan, Punjab, British India, in a Punjabi Hindu Khatri family. The exact date of his birth is not certain but he believed that it might have been 9 January 1922; this date was later shown in some documents, and has been widely accepted. He was the youngest of five children. His father was a patwari, a village agricultural taxation clerk in the British Indian government. In his autobiography, Khorana wrote this summary: &quot;Although poor, my father was dedicated to educating his children and we were practically the only literate family in the village inhabited by about 100 people.&quot; The first four years of his education were provided under a tree, a spot that was, in effect, the only school in the village. He did not even own a pencil until age 6.

He attended D.A.V. (Dayanand Anglo-Vedic) High School in Multan and Government College, in Lahore. Later, he studied at the Punjab University in Lahore, with the assistance of scholarships, where he obtained a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1943 and a Master of Science degree in 1945.

Khorana lived in British India until 1945, when he moved to England to study organic chemistry at the University of Liverpool on a Government of India Fellowship. He received his PhD in 1948 advised by Roger J. S. Beer. The following year, he pursued postdoctoral studies with Professor Vladimir Prelog at ETH Zurich in Switzerland. He worked for nearly a year on alkaloid chemistry in an unpaid position.

His family moved to Delhi from Multan as refugees during the partition of India and Khorana was never to visit his place of birth after that. During a brief period in 1949, he was unable to find a job in Delhi. He returned to England on a fellowship to work with George Wallace Kenner and Alexander R. Todd on peptides and nucleotides. He stayed in Cambridge from 1950 until 1952.

He moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, with his family in 1952 after accepting a position with the British Columbia Research Council at University of British Columbia. Khorana was excited by the prospect of starting his own lab, a colleague later recalled. His mentor later said that the council had few facilities at the time but gave the researcher &quot;all the freedom in the world&quot;. His work in British Columbia was on &quot;nucleic acids and synthesis of many important biomolecules&quot; according to the American Chemical Society.

In 1960 Khorana accepted a position as co-director of the University of Wisconsin–Madison&#x27;s Institute for Enzyme Research He became a professor of biochemistry in 1962 and was named Conrad A. Elvehjem Professor of Life Sciences in 1964. While at Wisconsin, &quot;he helped decipher the mechanisms by which RNA codes for the synthesis of proteins&quot; and &quot;began to work on synthesizing functional genes&quot;. During his tenure at this university, he completed the work that led to sharing the Nobel Prize in 1968. The Nobel web site states that it was &quot;for their interpretation of the genetic code and its function in protein synthesis&quot;. Har Gobind Khorana&#x27;s role is stated as follows: he &quot;made important contributions to this field by building different RNA chains with the help of enzymes. Using these enzymes, he was able to produce proteins. The amino acid sequences of these proteins then solved the rest of the puzzle.&quot;

He became a US citizen in 1966. Beginning in 1970, Khorana was the Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Biology and Chemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and later, a member of the Board of Scientific Governors at The Scripps Research Institute. He retired from MIT in 2007.

Har Gobind Khorana married Esther Elizabeth Sibler in 1952. They had met in Switzerland and had three children, Julia Elizabeth, Emily Anne, and Dave Roy.

==Research==
Ribonucleic acid (RNA) with two repeating units (UCUCUCU → UCU CUC UCU) produced two alternating amino acids. This, combined with the Nirenberg and Leder experiment, showed that UCU genetically codes for serine and CUC codes for leucine. RNAs with three repeating units (UACUACUA → UAC UAC UAC, or ACU ACU ACU, or CUA CUA CUA) produced three different strings of amino acids. RNAs with four repeating units including UAG, UAA, or UGA, produced only dipeptides and tripeptides thus revealing that UAG, UAA, and UGA are stop codons.

Their Nobel lecture was delivered on 12 December 1968. Khorana was the first scientist to chemically synthesize oligonucleotides.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1126/science.366749&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This achievement, in the 1970s, was also the world&#x27;s first synthetic gene; in later years, the process has become widespread. Subsequent scientists referred to his research while advancing genome editing with the CRISPR/Cas9 system.

===Subsequent research===
After years of work, he was the first in the world to complete the total synthesis of a functional gene outside a living organism in 1972. He did this by extending the above to long DNA polymers using non-aqueous chemistry and assembled these into the first synthetic gene, using polymerase and ligase enzymes that link pieces of DNA together, as well as methods that anticipated the invention of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). These custom-designed pieces of artificial genes are widely used in biology labs for sequencing, cloning and engineering new plants and animals, and are integral to the expanding use of DNA analysis to understand gene-based human disease as well as human evolution. Khorana&#x27;s invention(s) have become automated and commercialized so that anyone now can order a synthetic oligonucleotide or a gene from any of a number of companies. One merely needs to send the genetic sequence to one of the companies to receive an oligonucleotide with the desired sequence.

After the middle of the 1970s, his lab studied the biochemistry of bacteriorhodopsin, a membrane protein that converts light energy into chemical energy by creating a proton gradient. Later, his lab went on to study the structurally related visual pigment known as rhodopsin.

A summary of his work was provided by a former colleague at the University of Wisconsin: &quot;Khorana was an early practitioner, and perhaps a founding father, of the field of chemical biology. He brought the power of chemical synthesis to bear on deciphering the genetic code, relying on different combinations of trinucleotides.&quot;

==Awards and honors==

In addition to sharing the Nobel Prize, Khorana was elected a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1966, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1967, a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1973, and a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1978. The Indian government awarded Khorana the Padma Vibhushan in 1969.

In 2009, Khorana was hosted by the Khorana Program and honored at the 33rd Steenbock Symposium in Madison, Wisconsin.

Other honors included the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University and the Lasker Foundation Award for Basic Medical Research, both in 1969, the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1971, the Willard Gibbs Medal of the Chicago section of the American Chemical Society, in 1974, the Gairdner Foundation Annual Award, in 1980 and the Paul Kayser International Award of Merit in Retina Research, in 1987.

On 9 January 2018, a Google Doodle celebrated the achievements of Har Gobind Khorana on what would have been his 96th birthday.

The &quot;Khorana Program&quot; by Government of India&#x27;s Department of Biotechnology, the University of Wisconsin–Madison, Wisconsin–India Science and Technology Exchange Program (WINStep Forward/WSF) and the Indo-US Science and Technology Forum is a scholarship instituted in his name, since 2007 it has offered Indian students research opportunities at certain US universities. The mission of the Khorana Program is to build a seamless community of scientists, industrialists, and social entrepreneurs in the United States and India. The program is focused on three objectives: Providing graduate and undergraduate students with a transformative research experience, engaging partners in rural development and food security, and facilitating public-private partnerships between the U.S. and India. The WINStep Forward adopted administration responsibilities for the Khorana program in 2007. WINStep Forward was jointly created by Drs. Aseem Ansari and Ken Shapiro at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. WINStep Forward also administers the nationally competitive S. N. Bose Programs for Indian and American students, respectively, to promote both fundamental and applied research not only in biotechnology but broadly across all STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields, including medicine, pharmacy, agriculture, wildlife and climate change.

==Death==
Khorana died on 9 November 2011, in Concord, Massachusetts, at the age of 89. His wife, Esther, and daughter, Emily Anne, had died earlier, but Khorana was survived by his other two children. Julia Elizabeth later wrote about her father&#x27;s work as a professor: &quot;Even while doing all this research, he was always really interested in education, in students and young people.&quot;

<doc id="422564" wikidata="Q729427" url="?curid=422564" title="Jakarta Faces">
<text>Jakarta Faces, formerly Jakarta Server Faces and JavaServer Faces (JSF) is a Java specification for building component-based user interfaces for web applications. It was formalized as a standard through the Java Community Process as part of the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition. It is an MVC web framework that simplifies the construction of user interfaces (UI) for server-based applications by using reusable UI components in a page.

JSF 2.x uses Facelets as its default templating system. Users of the software may also use XUL or Java. JSF 1.x uses JavaServer Pages (JSP) as its default templating system.

==History==

In 2001, the original Java Specification Request (JSR) for the technology that ultimately became JavaServer Faces proposed developing a package with the name codice_1

In June 2001, &quot;JavaWorld&quot; would report on Amy Fowler&#x27;s team&#x27;s design of &quot;the JavaServer Faces API&quot; (also known as &quot;Moonwalk&quot;) as &quot;an application framework for creating Web-based user interfaces&quot;.

===Developments===
Facelets (which was designed specifically for Java Server Faces) was adopted as the official view technology for JSF 2.0. This eliminates the life-cycle conflicts that existed with JSP, forcing workarounds by Java developers.

The new JSF developments also provide wide accessibility to Java annotations such as codice_2, codice_3 and codice_4 that removes the need for codice_5 in all cases except framework extension. Navigation is also simplified, removing the need for codice_6 navigation cases. Page transitions can be invoked simply by passing the name of the desired View or Facelet.

The addition of Partial State Saving and Document Object Model (DOM) updates are part of the built-in standardized AJAX support.

The latest JSF release has built-in support for handling resources like images, CSS and Javascript, allowing artifacts to be included with component libraries, separated into JAR files, or simply co-located into a consistent place within the Web application. This includes logical naming and versioning of resources.

JSF 2.0 also includes a number of other changes like adding support for events, separate development, staging, and production modes, similar to codice_7 in Ruby on Rails, and significantly expanding the standard set of components.

===Update history===
* JSF 4.0 (2022-05-15) Major features: Deleted some deprecated things (native managed beans, native EL references), no extended view by default, added ClientWindowScoped
* JSF 3.0.0 (2020-10-28) Package name changed from Javax to Jakarta.
* JSF 2.3 (2019-09-10) The first release of the Jakarta Server Pages API for Jakarta EE.Neither the API nor the behavior has changed.
* JSF 2.3 (2017-03-28) – Major features: search Expressions, extensionless URLs, bean validation for complete classes, push communication using WebSocket, enhanced integration with CDI.
* JSF 2.2 (2013-05-21) – Introduced new concepts like stateless views, page flow and the ability to create portable resource contracts.
* JSF 2.1 (2010-11-22) – Maintenance release 2 of JSF 2.0. Only a very minor number of specification changes.
* JSF 2.0 (2009-07-01) – Major release for ease of use, enhanced functionality, and performance. Coincides with Java EE 6.
* JSF 1.2 (2006-05-11) – Many improvements to core systems and APIs. Coincides with Java EE 5. Initial adoption into Java EE.
* JSF 1.1 (2004-05-27) – Bug-fix release. No specification changes.
* JSF 1.0 (2004-03-11) – Initial specification released.

==How it works==
Based on a component-driven UI design-model, JavaServer Faces uses XML files called view templates or Facelets views. The codice_8 processes requests, loads the appropriate view template, builds a component tree, processes events, and renders the response (typically in the HTML language) to the client. The state of UI components and other objects of scope interest is saved at the end of each request in a process called stateSaving (note: &quot;transient&quot; true), and restored upon next creation of that view. Either the client or the server side can save objects and states.

===JSF and AJAX===
JSF is often used together with AJAX, a Rich Internet application development technique. AJAX is a combination of web development techniques and technologies that make it possible to create rich user interfaces. The user interface components in Mojarra (the JSF reference implementation) and Apache MyFaces were originally developed for HTML only, and AJAX had to be added via JavaScript. This has changed, however:

Because JSF supports multiple output formats, AJAX-enabled components can easily be added to improve user interfaces created with JSF. The JSF 2.0 specification provides built-in support for AJAX by standardizing the AJAX request lifecycle and providing simple development interfaces to AJAX events. The specification allows an event triggered by the client to go through validation, conversion, and method invocation, before returning the result to the browser via an XML DOM update.

JSF 2 includes support for graceful degradation when JavaScript is disabled in the browser.

==AJAX-enabled components and frameworks==
The following companies and projects offer AJAX-based JSF frameworks or component libraries:
* Apache MyFaces – The Apache Foundation JSF implementation with AJAX components
* Backbase &quot;Enterprise AJAX – JSF Edition&quot; – AJAX framework
* BootsFaces &quot;Open source JSF Framework based on Bootstrap&quot;
* IBM Notes – XPages
* ICEfaces – open-source, Java JSF extension framework and rich components, AJAX without JavaScript
* JBoss &quot;RichFaces&quot; (derived from and replaces &quot;AJAX4jsf&quot;) – AJAX-enabled JSF components for layout, file upload, forms, inputs and many other features. It reached its end-of-life in June 2016.
* OmniFaces – open-source JSF utility library
* OpenFaces – AJAX framework with JSF components
* Oracle &quot;ADF Faces Rich Client&quot; – Oracle Application Development Framework
* PrimeFaces – AJAX framework with JSF components
* Sun Java BluePrints AJAX components
* ZK – AJAX framework with JSF components

==Criticisms==
=== ThoughtWorks, 2014 ===
In their January 2014 &quot;Technology Radar&quot; publication, ThoughtWorks wrote:

==== Rebuttal ====
In February 2014, Çağatay Çivici (PrimeFaces Lead) responded to ThoughtWorks criticisms in a post titled &quot;JSF is not what you&#x27;ve been told anymore&quot;. Çivici argues that improvements in JSF over the years offer many features that embrace modern web development, providing the option to write your own JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Also regarding state, Çivici wrote:

=== DZone, 2014 ===
In the article published November 2014 in the DZone website, titled &quot;Why You Should Avoid JSF&quot;, Jens Schauder wrote: 

=== TheServerSide, 2016 ===
In February 2016, the enterprise Java community website &quot;TheServerSide&quot; published an article recommending against the use of JSF, whose use could compromise the quality of the final product. The article ellaborated on five reasons:

# Simple tasks become difficult;
# JSF lacks flexibility;
# The learning curve is steep;
# Incompatibility with standard Java technologies; and
# Primitive AJAX support.

<text>This article lists the wide variety of locomotives and multiple units that have operated on Great Britain&#x27;s railway network, since Nationalisation in 1948.

British Rail used several numbering schemes for classifying its steam locomotive types and other rolling stock, before settling on the TOPS computer system in the late 1960s. TOPS has remained in use ever since.

==Steam locomotives==

* Steam locomotives in use after 1968: Class 98

==Diesel and electric locomotives==

* Diesel locomotives: Classes 01–70
* DC electric and electro-diesel locomotives: Classes 70–79
* AC electric locomotives: Classes 80–96
* Departmental locos (those not in revenue-earning use): Class 97
* Miscellaneous locomotives, including builders&#x27; demonstrators.

==Shipping fleet==
British Rail&#x27;s shipping fleet: 
==Diesel multiple units==
* Units with mechanical or hydraulic transmission: Classes 100-199
* Units with electric transmission: Classes 200–299

==Electric multiple units==

* Overhead AC and Dual-voltage EMUs: Classes 300–399 and 700-799
* Southern Region DC third rail EMUs: Classes 400–499
* Other DC EMUs: Classes 500–599
* High-speed EMUs: Classes 800-899

<doc id="422567" wikidata="Q750304" url="?curid=422567" title="Fehling's solution">
<text>In organic chemistry, Fehling&#x27;s solution is a chemical reagent used to differentiate between water-soluble carbohydrate and ketone () functional groups, and as a test for reducing sugars and non-reducing sugars, supplementary to the Tollens&#x27; reagent test. The test was developed by German chemist Hermann von Fehling in 1849.

==Laboratory preparation==
Fehling&#x27;s solution is prepared by combining two separate solutions: Fehling&#x27;s A, which is a deep blue aqueous solution of copper(II) sulfate, and Fehling&#x27;s B, which is a colorless solution of aqueous potassium sodium tartrate (also known as Rochelle salt) made strongly alkaline with sodium hydroxide. These two solutions, stable separately, are combined when needed for the test because the copper(II) complex formed by their combination is not stable: it slowly decomposes into copper hydroxide in the alkaline conditions. The active reagent is a tartrate complex of Cu2+, which serves as an oxidizing agent. The tartrate serves as a ligand. However, the coordination chemistry is complex and various species with different metal to ligand ratio have been determined.

Other methods of preparing comparable cupric-ion test-reagent solutions were developed at about the same time as Fehling&#x27;s. These include the Viollette solution (eponymous for (1823–1894)) and the Soxhlet solution (eponymous for Franz Ritter von Soxhlet (1848–1926)), both containing tartrate, and Soldaïni&#x27;s solution (eponymous for Arturo Soldaïni), which instead contains carbonate. Barfoed&#x27;s test is also related and similar to Fehling&#x27;s test (eponymous for Christen Thomsen Barfoed (1815–1889)).

==Use of the reagent==
Fehling&#x27;s solution can be used to distinguish aldehyde vs ketone functional groups. The compound to be tested is added to the Fehling&#x27;s solution and the mixture is heated. Aldehydes are oxidized, giving a positive result, but ketones do not react, unless they are α-hydroxy ketones. The bistartratocuprate(II) complex oxidizes the aldehyde to a carboxylate anion, and in the process the copper(II) ions of the complex are reduced to copper(I) ions. Red copper(I) oxide then precipitates out of the reaction mixture, which indicates a positive result i.e. that redox has taken place (this is the same positive result as with Benedict&#x27;s solution).

Fehling&#x27;s test can be used as a generic test for monosaccharides and other reducing sugars (e.g., maltose). It will give a positive result for aldose monosaccharides (due to the oxidisable aldehyde group) but also for ketose monosaccharides, as they are converted to aldoses by the base in the reagent, and then give a positive result.

Fehling&#x27;s can be used to screen for glucose in urine, thus detecting diabetes. Another use is in the breakdown of starch to convert it to glucose syrup and maltodextrins in order to measure the amount of reducing sugar, thus revealing the dextrose equivalent (DE) of the starch sugar.

Formic acid (HCO2H) also gives a positive Fehling&#x27;s test result, as it does with Tollens&#x27; (eponymous for Bernhard Christian Gottfried Tollens (1841 – 1918)) test and Benedict&#x27;s solution also. The positive tests are consistent with it being readily oxidizable to carbon dioxide.

The solution cannot differentiate between benzaldehyde and acetone.

==Net reaction==
The net reaction between an aldehyde and the copper(II) ions in Fehling&#x27;s solution may be written as:

: &lt;chem&gt;RCHO + 2 Cu^2+ + 5 OH- -&gt; RCOO- + Cu2O + 3 H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

or with the tartrate included:

: &lt;chem&gt;RCHO + 2 Cu(C4H4O6)2^2- + 5 OH- -&gt; RCOO- + Cu2O + 4 C4H4O6^2- + 3 H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

<doc id="422568" wikidata="Q456639" url="?curid=422568" title="John Lurie">
<text>John Lurie (born December 14, 1952) is an American musician, painter, actor, director, and producer. He co-founded the Lounge Lizards jazz ensemble; has acted in 19 films, including &quot;Stranger than Paradise&quot; and &quot;Down by Law&quot;; has composed and performed music for 20 television and film works; and he produced, directed, and starred in the &quot;Fishing with John&quot; television series. In 1996 his soundtrack for &quot;Get Shorty&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award, and his album &quot;The Legendary Marvin Pontiac: Greatest Hits&quot; has been praised by critics and fellow musicians.

Since 2000, he has suffered from symptoms attributed to chronic Lyme disease and has focused his attention on painting. His art has been shown in galleries and museums around the world. His primitivist painting &quot;Bear Surprise&quot; became an internet meme in Russia in 2006. His television series, &quot;Painting with John&quot;, debuted on HBO in January 2021 and ran for three seasons before being cancelled. Lurie&#x27;s 1980s NYC memoir, &quot;The History of Bones&quot;, was published by Penguin Random House in August 2021.

==Early life==
Lurie was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and raised with his brother Evan and sister Liz in New Orleans, Louisiana, and Worcester, Massachusetts. His mother, an artist, was Welsh, and his father was half Russian Jewish and half Sicilian.

In high school, he played basketball and harmonica and jammed with Mississippi Fred McDowell and Canned Heat in 1968. He briefly played the harmonica in a band from Boston, but soon switched to the guitar and eventually the saxophone.

After high school, he hitchhiked across the United States to Berkeley, California. He moved to New York City in 1974, then briefly visited London, where he performed his first saxophone solo at the Acme Gallery.

==Music==

===The Lounge Lizards===

In 1978 John formed the Lounge Lizards with his brother Evan Lurie on piano; they were the only constant members in the band through numerous lineup changes.

Robert Palmer of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the band as &quot;staking out new territory west of Mingus, east of Bernard Herrman.&quot; While originally a somewhat satirical &quot;fake jazz&quot; combo spawned by the noisy No Wave music scene, the Lounge Lizards gradually became a showcase for Lurie&#x27;s increasingly sophisticated compositions. The band had five to eight members. Musicians included, at different times, guitarists Arto Lindsay, Marc Ribot, David Tronzo, Michele Navazio and Danny Blumenthal; cellist Jane Scarpantoni; vibraphonist Bryan Carrott; keyboardist John Medeski; drummers Anton Fier, Grant Calvin Weston and Dougie Bowne; percussionists Billy Martin, E.J. Rodriguez and Ben Perowsky; bassists Erik Sanko, Tony Scherr, Oren Bloedow and Tony Garnier; trumpeter Steven Bernstein; trombonist Curtis Fowlkes and saxophonists Roy Nathanson and Michael Blake. They made music for 20 years.

===Marvin Pontiac===
In 1999 Lurie released the album &quot;The Legendary Marvin Pontiac: Greatest Hits&quot;, a posthumous collection of the work of an African-Jewish musician named Marvin Pontiac, a fictional character Lurie created. It includes a biographical profile describing the troubled genius&#x27;s hard life, and the cover shows a photograph purported to be one of the few ever taken of him. Lurie wrote the music and performed with John Medeski, Billy Martin, G. Calvin Weston, Marc Ribot, and Tony Scherr. The album received praise from David Bowie, Angelique Kidjo, Iggy Pop, Leonard Cohen and others. On choosing to create a character to whom the album would be fictionally credited, Lurie said in a 2008 interview, &quot;For a long time, I was threatening to do a vocal record. But the idea of me putting out a record where I sang seemed ostentatious or pretentious. Like the music of Telly Savalas . . . I don&#x27;t sing very well, I was shy about it. As a character, it made it easier.&quot;

Elmore Leonard&#x27;s 2002 novel &quot;Tishomingo Blues&quot; has detailed descriptions of Marvin Pontiac&#x27;s biography and music, crediting him with influencing Iggy Pop and David Bowie.

In 2017, John Lurie released his first music album in 17 years, &quot;Marvin Pontiac: The Asylum Tapes&quot;.

===John Lurie National Orchestra===

Parallel to the final version of the Lounge Lizards in the early 1990s, Lurie formed a smaller group, the John Lurie National Orchestra. Lurie played alto and soprano saxes, Grant Calvin Weston played drums, and Billy Martin performed on congas, timbales, kalimba, and other small percussion. Unlike the tightly-arranged music of the Lounge Lizards, the Orchestra&#x27;s music was heavily improvised and compositions were credited to all three musicians.

They released the album &quot;Men With Sticks&quot; (Crammed Discs 1993) and recorded music for the &quot;Fishing With John&quot; TV series. In February 2014 the Orchestra released &quot;The Invention of Animals&quot;, a collection of out-of-print studio tracks and unreleased live recordings from the &#x27;90s. Columnist Mel Minter wrote:
This new release may require a reassessment of Lurie the saxophonist because the playing is engagingly fluid, inventive, and visceral—and well worth revisiting. . . . The emotional immediacy of Lurie&#x27;s playing – and that of his partners – makes for riveting stuff. Think of his sax not so much as a musical instrument, but instead, as a window with a clear view of his soul.
Jeff Jackson of Jazziz added, &quot;The resulting music is delicate, primal and utterly gorgeous.&quot;

==Film and television==
In 1993 Lurie composed the theme to &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; with Howard Shore. The theme was also used when O&#x27;Brien hosted on &quot;The Tonight Show.&quot; Lurie formed his own record label in 1998, Strange &amp; Beautiful Music, and released the Lounge Lizards album &quot;Queen of All Ears&quot; and a &quot;Fishing with John&quot; soundtrack.

Lurie has written scores for over 20 movies, including &quot;Stranger than Paradise&quot;, &quot;Down by Law&quot;, &quot;Mystery Train&quot;, &quot;Clay Pigeons&quot;, &quot;Animal Factory&quot;, and &quot;Get Shorty&quot;, for which he received a Grammy Award nomination.

In the 1980s, Lurie starred in the Jim Jarmusch films &quot;Stranger Than Paradise&quot; and &quot;Down by Law&quot;, and made cameos in the films &quot;Permanent Vacation&quot; and &quot;Downtown 81&quot;. He went on to act in other notable films including &quot;Paris, Texas&quot;, &quot;Wild at Heart&quot; and &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot;. From 2001 to 2003 he starred in the HBO prison series &quot;Oz&quot; as inmate Greg Penders.

Lurie wrote, directed and starred in the TV series &quot;Fishing with John&quot; in 1991 and 1992, which featured guests Tom Waits, Willem Dafoe, Matt Dillon, Jim Jarmusch, and Dennis Hopper. It aired on IFC and Bravo. It has since become a cult classic and was released on DVD by Criterion.

In January 2021 Lurie&#x27;s series &quot;Painting with John&quot; aired on HBO. In June 2021 he announced that a second season of the show was planned and for the first time in 22 years, he was rehearsing music for it. The third season of &quot;Painting with John&quot;, consisting of six episodes, first aired on June 2, 2023. Lurie&#x27;s friend and fellow musician Flea appears in one of the episodes.

==Painting==
Lurie has been painting since the 1970s. Most of his early works are in watercolor and pencil, but in the 2000s he began working in oil. In 2011, he said of his art, &quot;My paintings are a logical development from the ones that were taped to the refrigerator 50 years ago.&quot;

His work has been exhibited since July 2003, when two pieces were shown at the Nolan/Eckman Gallery in New York City. He had his first solo gallery exhibition at Anton Kern Gallery in May and June 2004 and has subsequently been exhibited at Galerie Daniel Blau in Munich, Galerie Lelong in Zürich, the Galerie Gabriel Rolt in Amsterdam, the Basel International Art Fair at Roebling Hall and the P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center in New York, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, the NEXT Art Fair in Chicago, the Mudam Luxembourg, the Watari Museum of Contemporary Art in Tokyo, Gallery Brown in Los Angeles, and the University of the Arts in Philadelphia. The Museum of Modern Art has acquired some of his work for their permanent collection.

Lurie has released two art books. &quot;Learn To Draw&quot;, a compilation of black and white drawings, was published by Walther Konig in June 2006. &quot;A Fine Example of Art&quot; includes over 80 reproductions of his work and was published by powerHouse Books in 2008.

Lurie&#x27;s watercolor painting &quot;Bear Surprise&quot; was enormously popular on numerous Russian websites in an Internet meme known as Preved.

==Personal life==
===Romantic relationships===
Lurie has never married. He detailed many of his romantic relationships between the 1970s and 1990s in his 2021 memoir &quot;The History of Bones.&quot; In August 2010, Lurie was reported to be dating a woman named Jill Goodwin (b. 1979).

Lurie became ill with neurological symptoms in 1994, and has experienced debilitating ill health since 2000. At one point he was told he had a year to live. During this time, he wrote in a mad dash until his brain fog got so severe that he had to stop writing.

He stated in a 2006 interview that he has &quot;Advanced Lyme&quot;, referring to chronic Lyme disease. This is a controversial medical diagnosis, generally rejected by medical professionals, used to describe &quot;a broad array of illnesses or symptom complexes for which there is no reproducible or convincing scientific evidence of any relationship to Borrelia burgdorferi infection.&quot; He has stated that his diagnosis was received from &quot;eight different purveyors of contemporary medicine&quot; after years of disagreement among his physicians. Lurie&#x27;s illness prevents him from acting or performing music, so he spends his time painting.

===Stalking incident===
In August 2010, Tad Friend wrote a piece in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; about Lurie disappearing from New York to avoid a man named John Perry, who Friend said was stalking Lurie. In the online literary magazine &quot;The Rumpus&quot;, Rick Moody noted that Friend&#x27;s profile in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, nominally about Lurie and his art, was two-thirds to three-quarters about Perry, including a full page photo of Perry standing in front of one of his own paintings. Moody described Perry as a deceitful stalker capable of violence and was also critical of Friend&#x27;s &quot;ungenerous&quot; characterization of Lurie&#x27;s illness as a &quot;mysterious disease.&quot;

In May 2011 Perry undertook a public hunger strike to protest &quot;The New Yorker&quot; characterizing him as a stalker. Commenting about the protest, Lurie said, &quot;He&#x27;s conducting a hunger strike a half block from my house to prove he&#x27;s not a stalker.&quot; Lurie described the article as &quot;wildly inaccurate,&quot; noting that its publication did not resolve anything and that &quot;the situation continues.&quot;

Editor David Remnick said the piece in his magazine was &quot;thoroughly reported and fact-checked.&quot; But in a letter to &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in August 2012, several interviewees claimed their words had been &quot;twisted, misquoted, or ignored,&quot; and that &quot;the man presented in the article [Lurie] is not the man that we know.&quot; In a February 2014 interview, Lurie told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;What one would hope is that the beauty in the music and in the paintings can somehow transcend and invalidate the kind of sickness that led to the article being written as it was and the kind of irresponsibility that allowed it to be published.&quot;

<text>Galena, also called lead glance, is the natural mineral form of lead(II) sulfide (PbS). It is the most important ore of lead and an important source of silver.

Galena is one of the most abundant and widely distributed sulfide minerals. It crystallizes in the cubic crystal system often showing octahedral forms. It is often associated with the minerals sphalerite, calcite and fluorite.

==Occurrence==

Galena is the main ore of lead, used since ancient times, since lead can be smelted from galena in an ordinary wood fire. Galena typically is found in hydrothermal veins in association with sphalerite, marcasite, chalcopyrite, cerussite, anglesite, dolomite, calcite, quartz, barite, and fluorite. It is also found in association with sphalerite in low-temperature lead-zinc deposits within limestone beds. Minor amounts are found in contact metamorphic zones, in pegmatites, and disseminated in sedimentary rock.
In some deposits, the galena contains up to 0.5% silver, a byproduct that far surpasses the main lead ore in revenue. In these deposits significant amounts of silver occur as included silver sulfide mineral phases or as limited silver in solid solution within the galena structure. These argentiferous galenas have long been an important ore of silver. Silver-bearing galena is almost entirely of hydrothermal origin; galena in lead-zinc deposits contains little silver.

Galena deposits are found worldwide in various environments. Noted deposits include those at Freiberg in Saxony; Cornwall, the Mendips in Somerset, Derbyshire, and Cumberland in England; the Linares mines in Spain were worked from before the Roman times until the end of the 20th century; the Madan and Rhodope Mountains in Bulgaria; the Sullivan Mine of British Columbia; Broken Hill and Mount Isa in Australia; and the ancient mines of Sardinia.

In the United States, it occurs most notably as lead-zinc ore in the Mississippi Valley type deposits of the Lead Belt in southeastern Missouri, which is the largest known deposit, and in the Driftless Area of Illinois, Iowa and Wisconsin, providing the origin of the name of Galena, Illinois, a historical settlement known for the material. Galena also was a major mineral of the zinc-lead mines of the tri-state district around Joplin in southwestern Missouri and the adjoining areas of Kansas and Oklahoma. Galena is also an important ore mineral in the silver mining regions of Colorado, Idaho, Utah and Montana. Of the latter, the Coeur d&#x27;Alene district of northern Idaho was most prominent.

Australia is the world&#x27;s leading producer of lead as of 2021, most of which is extracted as galena. Argentiferous galena was accidentally discovered at Glen Osmond in 1841, and additional deposits were discovered near Broken Hill in 1876 and at Mount Isa in 1923. Most galena in Australia is found in hydrothermal deposits emplaced around 1680 million years ago, which have since been heavily metamorphosed.

The largest documented crystal of galena is composite cubo-octahedra from the Great Laxey Mine, Isle of Man, measuring . This specimen is on permanent display in the minerals gallery of the Natural History Museum, London.

==Importance==
Galena is the official state mineral of the U.S. states of Kansas, Missouri, and Wisconsin; the former mining communities of Galena, Kansas, Galena, Illinois, Galena, South Dakota and Galena, Alaska, take their names from deposits of this mineral.

==Structure==
Galena belongs to the octahedral sulfide group of minerals that have metal ions in octahedral positions, such as the iron sulfide pyrrhotite and the nickel arsenide niccolite. The galena group is named after its most common member, with other isometric members that include manganese bearing alabandite and niningerite.

Divalent lead (Pb) cations and sulfur (S) anions form a close-packed cubic unit cell much like the mineral halite of the halide mineral group. Zinc, cadmium, iron, copper, antimony, arsenic, bismuth and selenium also occur in variable amounts in galena. Selenium substitutes for sulfur in the structure constituting a solid solution series. The lead telluride mineral altaite has the same crystal structure as galena.

==Geochemistry==

Within the weathering or oxidation zone galena alters to anglesite (lead sulfate) or cerussite (lead carbonate). Galena exposed to acid mine drainage can be oxidized to anglesite by naturally occurring bacteria and archaea, in a process similar to bioleaching.

==Uses==
One of the oldest uses of galena was to produce kohl, an eye cosmetic now regarded as toxic due to the risk of lead poisoning. In Ancient Egypt, this was applied around the eyes to reduce the glare of the desert sun and to repel flies, which were a potential source of disease.

In pre-Columbian North America, galena was used by indigenous peoples as an ingredient in decorative paints and cosmetics, and widely traded throughout the eastern United States. Traces of galena are frequently found at the Mississippian city at Kincaid Mounds in present-day Illinois. The galena used at the site originated from deposits in southeastern and central Missouri and the Upper Mississippi Valley.

Galena is the primary ore of lead, and is often mined for its silver content. It is used as a source of lead in ceramic glaze.

Galena is a semiconductor with a small band gap of about 0.4 eV, which found use in early wireless communication systems. It was used as the crystal in crystal radio receivers, in which it was used as a point-contact diode capable of rectifying alternating current to detect the radio signals. The galena crystal was used with a sharp wire, known as a &quot;cat&#x27;s whisker&quot;, in contact with it.

In modern times, galena is primarily used to extract its constituent minerals. In addition to silver, it is the most important source of lead, for uses such as in lead-acid batteries.

<text>Perkins LLC (also known as Perkins Restaurant &amp; Bakery or Perkins American Food Co on the locations&#x27; signage) is an American casual dining restaurant chain which serves breakfast and other homestyle meals throughout the day in addition to bakery items including pies, muffins, and other sweets. As of April 2024, the company operates 265 locations in Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Ontario, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

== History ==

=== 1957−1984 ===
The Perkins chain was established in 1957, when Matt and Ivan Perkins opened &quot;Smithies Pancake House&quot; in Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1958, the chain expanded as a franchise. One franchisee in Minnesota, Wyman Nelson, introduced an aggressive advertising campaign and an expanded menu in 1967.

From 1969 to 1978, Nelson consolidated Perkins and another chain, Smitty&#x27;s, into Perkins &#x27;Cake &amp; Steak&#x27;. From the headquarters in Edina, Minnesota, he assumed nationwide development control of the company and focused on opening over 220 restaurants. In 1979, Matt and Ivan retired, selling their remaining interest in the company including trademark and distribution rights. In August 1979, Perkins became a wholly owned subsidiary of Memphis-based Holiday Inn, and the corporate headquarters were established in Memphis, Tennessee.

===1985−1999===
In 1985, restaurant entrepreneur Donald N. Smith, who served on the board of directors of Holiday Inn, purchased an ownership interest in Perkins, becoming the chairman of the board and the company&#x27;s CEO. The company was renamed Perkins Family Restaurants in 1987 and was organized into a master limited partnership with interests publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The corporation expanded into Canada, opening a restaurant in Thunder Bay, Ontario. In 1990, the company began a philanthropic relationship with Give Kids the World which is headquartered in Kissimmee south of Orlando, Florida. It contributes money and meals to the charity for terminally ill children globally.

Matt Perkins died of heart disease in 1991 at age 79 and Ivan Perkins died on February 11, 1998. At the time of Ivan&#x27;s death, the franchise had 462 restaurants in 32 states.

===2000−present===
Perkins underwent business changes in the 2000s. In 2000, it merged with a wholly owned subsidiary of The Restaurant Company (TRC). In 2005, TRC was acquired by Castle Harlan, a private equity investment firm based in New York City, for approximately $245 million. In May 2006, the parent company acquired Marie Callender&#x27;s, a chain of casual dining restaurants also known for their freshly baked pies combining it with the Perkins chain, forming Perkins &amp; Marie Callender&#x27;s Inc.

In June 2011, many restaurants were closed with no notice given to customers or staff. The closures were in Colorado, Kansas, Illinois, Tennessee, Florida, Michigan, and Minnesota. Later that month, Perkins &amp; Marie Callender&#x27;s Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. PMCI closed 65 restaurants and laid off 2,500 workers. In the bankruptcy proceedings PMCI listed assets of $290 million and liabilities of $441 million. PMCI emerged from bankruptcy at the end of November 2011 under the control of Wayzata Investment Partners, but continued to experience difficulties. In May 2012, it was announced that all western New York Perkins restaurants, except for the Olean, New York, location, would close.

On August 5, 2019, its parent company Perkins &amp; Marie Callender&#x27;s filed for bankruptcy while announcing the closure of 29 of their under-performing restaurants. The next month, several of its locations in northern Pennsylvania closed. On September 12, 2019, it was announced that Ascent Hospitality Management of Atlanta would acquire all remaining Perkins restaurants, a total of 342 units. On May 10, 2023, a health inspector shut down the Urbana, Illinois, location after a fourth consecutive inspection found refrigerated food being stored at unsafe temperatures.

In March 2024, Perkins announced a partnership with ezCater to bring catering to more than 180 locations. In the fall of 2024, the first &quot;Perkins American Food Co.&quot; will reopen in Orlando, Florida.

<text>Chemical castration is castration via anaphrodisiac drugs, whether to reduce libido and sexual activity, to treat cancer, or otherwise. Unlike surgical castration, where the gonads are removed through an incision in the body, chemical castration does not remove organs and is not a form of sterilization.

Chemical castration is generally reversible when treatment is discontinued, although permanent effects in body chemistry can sometimes be seen, as in the case of bone density loss increasing with length of use of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA). In men, chemical castration reduces sex drive and the capacity for sexual arousal, side effects of some drugs may include depression, suicidal ideation, hot flashes, anemia, infertility, increase in body fat and higher risks of cardiovascular diseases and osteoporosis. In women, chemical castration acts by decreasing testosterone levels in order to lower their sex drive, side effects include the deflation of breast glands, expansion of the size of the nipple and shrinking of bone mass.

In some jurisdictions, chemical castration has been used to reduce the libido of sexual offenders. The effectiveness of chemical castration in decreasing recidivism among sex offenders is controversial.

==Effects==
===On males===
When used on males, these drugs can reduce sex drive, sexual fantasies, and capacity for sexual arousal. Life-threatening side effects are rare, but some users show increases in body fat and reduced bone density, which increase long-term risk of cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis, respectively. Males may also experience gynecomastia (development of larger-than-normal mammary glands in males); full development is less common unless chemical castration is combined with feminizing oestrogen therapy.

Some drugs, such as medroxyprogesterone acetate, cyproterone acetate and LHRH agonists can decrease serum testosterone and estradiol in the body, thus impairing the metabolism of glucose and lipid. These drugs can also cause depression, hot flashes, infertility and anemia, aside from cardiovascular diseases and osteoporosis. The risk of side effects caused by chemical castration drugs can increase depending on the length of time under which they are administered. A 2004 study in which eleven men were chemically castrated ended with one committing suicide after one year of treatment; in another 2020 study, increases in suicidal ideations was reported by 8% of its treatment group, which led to the hospitalization of two of the 25 subjects who had been administered degarelix.

===On females===

When used on females, the effects are similar, though there is little research about chemically lowering female&#x27;s sex drive or female-specific anaphrodisiacs, since most research focuses on the opposite, but anti-androgenic hormone regimens would lower testosterone in females which can impact sex drive or sexual response. These drugs also deflate the breast glands and expand the size of the nipple. Also seen is a sudden shrinking in bone mass and discoloration of the lips, reduced body hair, and muscle mass.

==Treatment for sex offenders==
The first use of chemical castration occurred in 1944, when diethylstilbestrol was used with the purpose of lowering men&#x27;s testosterone.
The antipsychotic agent benperidol was sometimes used to decrease sexual urges in people who displayed what was thought of as inappropriate sexual behavior, and as likewise given by depot injection, though benperidol does not affect testosterone and is therefore not a castration agent.
Chemical castration was often seen as an easier alternative to life imprisonment or the death penalty because it allowed the release of the convicted.

In 1981, in an experiment by Pierre Gagné, 48 males with long-standing histories of sexually deviant behaviour were given medroxyprogesterone acetate for as long as 12 months. Forty of those subjects were recorded as having diminished desires for deviant sexual behaviour, as well as less frequent sexual fantasies and greater control over sexual urges. The research recorded a continuation of this improved behaviour after the administration of the drug had ended, with no evidence of adverse side effects, and so recommended medroxyprogesterone acetate along with counselling as a successful method of treatment for serial sex offenders.

Leuprolide acetate is an LHRH agonist that is most commonly used in chemical castration today. This drug has been observed as having higher rates of success in reducing abnormal sexual urges and fantasies, but is often reserved for those offenders who are at a high risk of reoffending due to the drug&#x27;s intense effects.

Psychotherapy has also recently been used in conjunction with chemical castration in order to maximize and prolong the beneficial results. Schober et al. reported in 2005 that when cognitive behavioral therapy combined with leuprolide acetetate was compared to cognitive behavioral therapy alone, the combination therapy produced a much more significant reduction of pedophilic fantasies and urges as well as masturbation. Chemical castration therapy reduces an individual&#x27;s libido which then makes some offenders more responsive to the introduction of psychotherapy. This combination therapy is most often utilized in those who are at a high risk of offending.

Offering criminals the option of chemical castration for a reduction in sentence is an example of compulsory sterilization as it can leave a subject sterile if they are required to continue treatment for more than 3 years.

===Scientific critique===
Some criminologists argue that the appearance of a lower recidivism rate in male sex offenders who take chemical castration treatment than in those who do not can be explained by factors other than biological effects of the medication. One hypothesis is that men who accept the negative effects of hormonal treatment in exchange for shorter prison sentence are distinct in that they value freedom from incarceration higher than men who rather stay in prison for a longer time than face the side effects of chemical castration. These criminologists explain apparently lower recidivism as an artifact of men who accept chemical castration being more engaged in hiding the evidence for reoffending, and that paroling such offenders constitute a risk of releasing criminals who commit as many new crimes as others but are better at hiding it. These criminologists also argue that police investigators treating castrated men as less likely to reoffend than non-castrated men may cause an investigation bias and self-fulfilling prophecy, and that men who sell some of their prescribed medicines on the black market for drugs get a hidden income that improves their ability to afford measures to hide recidivism that is not available to men without such prescriptions.

Some neurologists acknowledge that testosterone plays a role in sexual arousal but consider that reducing sex drive will likely not reduce inappropriate sex behaviour. These researchers argue that since a weaker internal signal in the brain means a higher requirement for external stimulation to create a feedback loop that tires the brain circuits out as in orgasm and lead to satisfaction, a reduction of the internal stimulation from hormones would make the required external stimulation stronger and also more specific, as weaker signals involve narrower ranges of other brain functions in their loops. These scientists therefore argue that the biological (as opposed to sociological) effect of reduced testosterone is to make it more difficult and not easier to use masturbation without pornography or other socially acceptable substitutes to manage remaining sex drive in a former offender, and that many community persons (both male and female) find that a lower initial arousal makes it more difficult to orgasm by masturbation without pornography or with non-preferred stimulation.

== Chemical castration by country ==

=== Africa ===

====South Africa====
In July 2022, a proposed policy of chemical castration for rapists was introduced at the national policy conference of the ruling party, the African National Congress, by the party&#x27;s Women&#x27;s League.

=== Americas ===

====Argentina====
In March 2010, Guillermo Fontana of CNN reported that officials in Mendoza, a province in Argentina, approved the use of voluntary chemical castration for rapists, in return for reduced sentences.

====United States====
In 1966, John Money became the first American to employ chemical castration by prescribing medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) as a treatment for a &quot;Bisexual transvestite with pedophiliac homosexual incest&quot; who was in &#x27;treatment&#x27; after their wife informed Money about them having sexually abused their 6-year-old son. The drug has thereafter become a mainstay of chemical castration in America. Despite having been extensively used in the United States for the purpose of decreasing sexual impulses, the drug has never been approved by the FDA for use as a treatment for sexual offenders.

California was the first U.S. state to specify the use of chemical castration for repeat child molesters as a condition of their parole, following the passage of a modification to Section 645 of the California penal code in 1996. This law stipulates castration for anyone convicted of child molestation with a minor under 13 years of age if they are on parole after their second offense. Offenders may not reject the intervention, although they may elect surgical castration instead of ongoing DMPA injections.

The passage of this law led to similar laws in other states such as Florida&#x27;s Statute Section 794.0235 which was passed into law in 1997.

At least seven other states, including Georgia, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana, Oregon, Texas and Wisconsin, have experimented with chemical castration. In Iowa, as in California and Florida, offenders may be sentenced to chemical castration in all cases involving serious sex offenses. On June 25, 2008, following the Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Kennedy v. Louisiana&quot; that the execution of child rapists where the victim was not killed was ruled unconstitutional, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal signed Senate Bill 144, allowing Louisiana judges to sentence convicted rapists to chemical castration. Alabama passed such a law in 2019.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Florida opposes the administration of any drug that is dangerous or has significant irreversible effect as an alternative to incarceration; however, they do not oppose the use of antiandrogen drugs for sex offenders under carefully controlled circumstances as an alternative to incarceration. Law professor John Stinneford has argued that chemical castration is a cruel and unusual punishment because it exerts control over the mind of sex offenders to render them incapable of sexual desire and subjects them to the physical changes caused by the hormones used.

Some people have argued that, based on the 14th Amendment, the procedure fails to guarantee equal protection: although the laws mandating the treatment do so without respect to gender, the actual effect of the procedure disproportionately falls upon men. In the case of voluntary statutes, the ability to give informed consent is also an issue; in 1984, the U.S. state of Michigan&#x27;s court of appeals held that mandating chemical castration as a condition of probation was unlawful on the grounds that the drug medroxyprogesterone acetate had not yet gained acceptance as being safe and reliable and also due to the difficulty of obtaining informed consent under these circumstances.

=== Asia ===

====India====
After the outrage following the gang rape of a woman in Delhi, the Government has submitted a draft proposing chemical castration along with an imprisonment of up to 30 years for rape convicts as part of the anti-rape law in India. The ministry is preparing a detailed bill and the recommended changes are under review.
Government is also planning to re-define the Juvenile Act and lower their age. One of the accused in the rape case is a juvenile and aged a few months less than 18 years. A view has been expressed by a section that only those below 15 years should be described as juvenile.

====Indonesia====
In 2016, the Indonesian President Joko Widodo introduced a presidential regulation (Government Regulation in Lieu of Law No.1/2016) to allow chemical castration to be handed down as a punishment to child sex offenders. The regulation alters the contents of the 2002 Law on Child Protection (Law No. 23 of 2002). DPR later enacted the regulation and amended the law (Law No. 17 of 2016) to enable chemical castration. Although, a convicted child sex offender convicted in 2019 and eligible to be castrated chemically, the technical details on how the punishment will be carried out was under debate between the Government and Indonesian Physicians Association, resulting the sentence suspended until the technical details made. On 7 December 2020, government finally issued Government Regulation No. 70/2020, that detailing technical details on how chemical castration carried out. The chemical castration punishment carried by specifically appointed physician in central government-run or local government-run hospital, and witnessed by witnesses from Attorney General, Ministry of Law and Human Rights, Ministry of Social Affairs, and Ministry of Health. The drugs used for the sentence however, not declared in the government regulation. The government regulation also authorized Ministry of Law and Human Rights to issue regulation to notify the Attorney General, and Ministry of Health to compile the technical procedure for the clinical assessment, conclusion, and implementation.

====Israel====
In May 2009, two brothers from Haifa—convicted child molesters—agreed to undergo chemical castration to avoid committing further crimes.

==== Pakistan ====
In 2020, Pakistan&#x27;s Prime Minister Imran Khan told a journalist that he would prefer that rapists and child molesters be publicly hanged, but he added that, because he imagined that such capital punishment would gain negative attention for Pakistan on the international stage, he would instead like such offenders to &quot;undergo chemical castration, or surgery be performed so they cannot do anything in future.&quot; The Anti-Rape Ordinance 2020, approved by President Arif Alvi in December 2020, allows for chemical castration of rapists without the consent of the offender. Lawmakers gave it permanent approval in November 2021.

====South Korea====
In July 2011, South Korea enacted a law allowing judges the power to sentence sex offenders who have attacked children under the age of 16 to chemical castration. The law also allows for chemical castration to be ordered by a Ministry of Justice committee. On May 23, 2012, a serial sex offender legally called Park in the court case was ordered by the committee to undergo this treatment after his most recent attempted offense. On January 3, 2013, a South Korean court sentenced a 31-year-old man to 15 years in jail and chemical castration, the country&#x27;s first-ever chemical castration sentence. In 2017, the sentencing was extended to include all forms of rapes and sexual assault cases against women, including attempted rape.

===Europe===
Legislation allowing chemical castration exists in France, the United Kingdom, Poland, Russia, North Macedonia, Belgium and Turkey. The drug cyproterone acetate has been commonly used for chemical castration throughout Europe. It resembles the drug MPA used in America.

==== Estonia ====
On June 5, 2012, Estonia passed a law that allows voluntary chemical castration as a part of complex treatment for less serious sex offenders as an alternative of imprisonment. However, the treatment is rarely used in practice.

==== Germany ====
In the 1960s, German physicians used antiandrogens as a treatment for sexual paraphilia.

==== Moldova ====
On March 6, 2012, Moldova legislated forcible chemical castration of child molesters; the law came into effect on July 1, 2012.

==== North Macedonia ====
In October and November 2013, North Macedonia authorities were working on developing a legal framework and standard procedure for implementation of chemical castration that would be used for convicted child molesters. The castration is intended to be voluntarily, where as for the child molesters that repeat the criminal act it should be mandatory.

==== Poland ====
On September 25, 2009, Poland legislated forcible chemical castration of child molesters. This law came into effect on June 9, 2010; therefore in Poland &quot;anyone guilty of raping a child under the age of 15 can now be forced to submit to chemical and psychological therapy to reduce sex drive at the end of a prison term&quot;.

==== Portugal ====
In 2008, an experimental intervention program was launched in three Portuguese prisons: Carregueira (Belas, Sintra), Paços de Ferreira and Funchal. The program developers note the voluntary nature of the program a crucial factor in its success. They initially planned to cover ten inmates per prison, contemplating a possible enlargement to other prisons in the future. The program also included a rehabilitation component.

In 2021, the right-wing populist Chega party pushed for a chemical castration bill in parliament.

====Russia====
In October 2011, the Russian parliament approved a law that allows a court-requested forensic psychiatrist to prescribe the chemical castration of convicted sex offenders who have harmed children under the age of 14.

==== United Kingdom ====
In the United Kingdom, computer scientist Alan Turing, famous for his contributions to mathematics and computer science, pleaded guilty in 1952 to a charge of gross indecency for engaging in homosexual acts and accepted chemical castration as a term of his probation, thus avoiding imprisonment. At the time, homosexual acts between males were illegal and homosexual orientation was widely considered to be a mental illness that could be treated with chemical castration. Turing experienced side effects such as gynecomastia (breast enlargement) and bloating of the physique. He died two years later, with the inquest returning a verdict of suicide. In 2009 British Prime Minister Gordon Brown issued a public apology for the &quot;appalling&quot; treatment of Turing after an online petition gained 30,000 signatures and international recognition. He was given a posthumous Royal Pardon in December 2013.

A law allowing voluntary chemical castration was created in the UK in 2007 by then home secretary John Reid.

On April 30, 2010, a 30-year-old man in the United Kingdom found guilty of attempting to murder a 60-year-old woman in order to abduct and rape her two granddaughters (aged eight and two) agreed to undergo chemical castration as part of the terms of his sentence. He was jailed for a minimum of 10 years at the High Court in Glasgow.

=== Oceania ===

====Australia====
In 2010, a 58-year-old repeat child sex offender who had been subject to chemical castration was accused of inappropriately touching and kissing a seven-year-old young girl. He was found not guilty by a jury, which was not informed of the context of his previous offenses.

==== New Zealand ====
In New Zealand, the antilibidinal drug cyproterone acetate is sold under the name Androcur. In November 2000 convicted child sex offender Robert Jason Dittmer attacked a victim while on the drug. In 2009 a study into the effectiveness of the drug by Dr David Wales for the Corrections Department found that no research had been conducted in New Zealand into the effectiveness and such trials were &quot;ethically and practically very difficult to carry out.&quot;

==Treatment of cancer==
A major medical use of chemical castration is in the treatment of hormone-dependent cancers, such as some prostate cancer, where it has largely replaced the practice of surgical castration. In 2020 a man in Canada who was receiving antiandrogen drug treatment for colon cancer murdered his doctor over the belief that they were chemically castrating him due to his race.

Chemical castration involves the administration of antiandrogen drugs, such as cyproterone acetate, flutamide, or gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists.

<doc id="422575" wikidata="Q2597609" url="?curid=422575" title="XScreenSaver">
<text>XScreenSaver is a free and open-source collection of 240+
screensavers for Unix, macOS, iOS and Android operating systems. It was created by Jamie Zawinski in 1992 and is still maintained by him, with new releases coming out several times a year.

==Platforms==
The free software and open-source Unix-like operating systems running the X Window System (such as Linux and FreeBSD) use XScreenSaver almost exclusively. On those systems, there are several packages: one for the screen-saving and locking framework, and two or more for the display modes, divided somewhat arbitrarily.

On Macintosh systems, XScreenSaver works with the built-in macOS screen saver.

On iOS systems, XScreenSaver is a stand-alone app that can run any of the hacks full-screen.

On Android systems, the XScreenSaver display modes work either as normal screen savers (which Android sometimes refers to as &quot;Daydreams&quot;) or as live wallpapers.

There is no official version for Microsoft Windows, and the developer discourages anyone from porting it. The author considers Microsoft to be &quot;a company with vicious, predatory, anti-competitive business practices&quot;
and says that, as one of the original authors of Netscape Navigator, he holds a &quot;personal grudge&quot; against Microsoft because of its behavior during the First Browser War.

== Software Architecture ==
The XScreenSaver daemon is responsible for detecting idle-ness, blanking and locking the screen, and launching the display modes. The display modes (termed &quot;hacks&quot; from the historical usage &quot;display hack&quot;) are each stand-alone programs.

This is an important security feature, in that the display modes are sandboxed into a separate process from the screen locking framework. This means that a programming error in one of the graphical display modes cannot compromise the screen locker itself (e.g., a crash in a display mode will not unlock the screen).

It also means that a third-party screen saver can be written in any language or with any graphics library, so long as it is capable of rendering onto an externally provided window.

For historical and portability reasons, the included hacks are all written in ANSI C. About half of them use the X11 API, and about half use the OpenGL 1.3 API.

Rather than forking the code-base and re-writing the hacks to target different platforms, XScreenSaver contains a number of compatibility layers.

* To allow the X11-based hacks to run natively on macOS and iOS, XScreenSaver contains a complete implementation of the X11 API built on top of Cocoa (&quot;jwxyz&quot;).

* To allow the OpenGL 1.3-based hacks to run natively on iOS and Android systems, which only support OpenGL ES, XScreenSaver contains an implementation of the OpenGL 1.3 API built in top of OpenGL ES 1.0 (&quot;jwzgles&quot;).
* And to allow the X11-based hacks to run natively on iOS and Android, XScreenSaver also contains an implementation of the X11 API in terms of OpenGL ES 1.0.

== Security ==
In addition to sandboxing the display modes, the XScreenSaver daemon links with as few libraries as possible. In particular, it does not link against GUI frameworks like GTK or KDE, but uses only raw Xlib for rendering the unlock dialog box.

In recent years, some Linux distributions have begun using the gnome-screensaver or kscreensaver screen-blanking frameworks by default instead of the framework included with XScreenSaver.
In 2011, gnome-screensaver was forked as both mate-screensaver and cinnamon-screensaver. Earlier versions of these frameworks still depended upon the XScreenSaver collection of screen savers, which is over 90% of the package.
However, in 2011, gnome-screensaver version 3 dropped support for screensavers completely, supporting only simple screen blanking,
and as of 2018, Linux Mint&#x27;s cinnamon-screensaver 4.0.8 no longer supports the XScreenSaver hacks.

Those Linux distributions that have replaced XScreenSaver with other screen-locking frameworks have suffered notable security problems. Those other frameworks have a history of security bugs that allow the screen to be un-locked without a password, e.g., by simply holding a key down until the locker crashes.

In 2004, Zawinski had written about the architectural decisions made in XScreenSaver with the goal of avoiding this very class of bug,

leading him to quip in 2015, &quot;If you are not running XScreenSaver on Linux, then it is safe to assume that your screen does not lock.&quot;

== Display Modes ==
The included hacks are highly varied, ranging from simple 2D psychedelia, to 3D demonstrations of complex mathematical principles, to simulations of other computer systems, to re-creations of artifacts and effects from movies.

Though many of the newer hacks take full advantage of the power of modern computers, the age of the project means that some of the older hacks may look dated to modern eyes, as they were originally written for much less powerful computers.

Examples of hacks include:

*&quot;Atlantis&quot; – an OpenGL animation showing whales and dolphins.
*&quot;BSOD&quot; – shows fake fatal screen of death variants from many computer systems, including Microsoft Windows Blue Screen of Death, a Linux kernel panic, a Darwin crash, an Amiga &quot;Guru Meditation&quot; error, a sad Mac, and more.
*&quot;Apple2&quot; – simulates an Apple II computer, showing a user entering a simple BASIC program and running it. When run from the command-line, it is a fully functional terminal emulator (as is &quot;Phosphor&quot;.)
*&quot;Barcode&quot; – a number of coloured barcodes scroll across the screen.
*&quot;Flow&quot; – a 3D display of strange attractors.
*&quot;Flying toasters&quot; – 3D toasters fly around, inspired by the classic After Dark screensaver.
*&quot;Gears&quot; – an OpenGL animation of inter-meshing gears and planetary gears.
*&quot;GLMatrix&quot; – an OpenGL animation similar to the &quot;digital rain&quot; title sequence seen in the Matrix trilogy.
*&quot;Molecule&quot; – an OpenGL animation showing space-filling or ball-and-stick models of a series of common drugs and other molecules, of which thirty-eight (38) are built in. It can also read PDB (Protein Data Bank) from a file, or files placed in a directory, as input.
*&quot;Penrose&quot; – tiles the screen aperiodically with coloured Penrose tiles.
*&quot;Spotlight&quot; – puts a moving spotlight across the desktop in the style of the James Bond film opening sequences.
*&quot;Sproingies&quot; – an animation in the style of the video game &quot;Q*bert&quot;.
*&quot;Webcollage&quot; – creates collages out of random images found on the Web.
*&quot;XAnalogTV&quot; – simulates an analog cathode-ray tube television set, including visual artifacts and reception issues.
*&quot;XPlanet&quot; – draws planets and other celestial bodies that update in real time.
*&quot;XMatrix&quot; – animations similar to the &quot;digital rain&quot; sequence seen in the Matrix trilogy.

Some of the included hacks are very similar to demo effects created by the demoscene:
* &quot;Boing&quot; – based on the 1984 program regarded as the first Amiga demo ever, showing the bouncing red and white ball.
* &quot;Bumps&quot; – an implementation of full-screen 2D bump mapping.
* &quot;Metaballs&quot; – another common demo effect.
* &quot;Moire2&quot; – moving interference circles similar to those common in older Amiga demos.
* &quot;ShadeBobs&quot; – another effect common in older Amiga demos.
* &quot;XFlame&quot; – the filter-based fire effect, also known as flame effect.

<doc id="422578" wikidata="Q5593755" url="?curid=422578" title="Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album">
<text>The Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album is an award presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, to recording artists for quality works (songs or albums) in the bluegrass music genre. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

Originally called the Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Recording (Vocal or Instrumental), the award was first presented in 1989. In 1990 and 1991, the category was renamed Best Bluegrass Recording, and in 1990, the award was reserved for singles rather than albums. Since 1992, the award has been presented under the category Best Bluegrass Album. Beginning in 1993, award recipients often included the producers, engineers, and/or mixers associated with the nominated work in addition to the recording artists. In 1995 and 1997, producers of compilation albums were the only award recipients.

The inaugural recipient of the award was Bill Monroe, widely considered to be the founder of the genre. Alison Krauss has the most wins in the category, with six, including five with her band Union Station who are tied with Ricky Skaggs and Kentucky Thunder for second most wins. Jim Lauderdale, Nashville Bluegrass Band, and Molly Tuttle &amp; Golden Highway are the only other acts to have won more than once, with two awards each. Del McCoury holds the record for most nominations, with ten, while Doyle Lawson, Noam Pickelny, Peter Rowan, and The Seldom Scene have the most nominations without a win, with four. In 2018, the first tie in the history of the category occurred, with the award being presented to both Rhonda Vincent and The Infamous Stringdusters. The current recipient of the award is Billy Strings, who won at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards.

<doc id="422582" wikidata="Q661759" url="?curid=422582" title="Battle of Sempach">
<text>The Battle of Sempach was fought on 9 July 1386, between Leopold III, Duke of Austria and the Old Swiss Confederacy. The battle was a decisive Swiss victory in which Duke Leopold and numerous Austrian nobles died. The victory helped turn the loosely allied Swiss Confederation into a more unified nation and is seen as a turning point in the growth of Switzerland.

==Background==
During 1383 and 1384, the expansion of the Old Swiss Confederacy collided with Austrian interests. The interests of Austria were further undermined in the Pact of Constance, a union of Zürich, Zug, Solothurn and 51 cities of Swabia. In 1385, there were various attacks, without formal declaration of war or central organization, by forces of Zürich, Zug and Lucerne on the Austrian strongholds of Rapperswil, Rothenburg, Cham and Wolhusen.

In 1384 the people of Entlebuch receive the Lucerne citizenry and on Epiphany, on 6 January 1386, Lucerne expanded its sphere of influence by providing the same right also to the people of Sempach. Lucerne entered further pacts with a number of towns and valleys under Austrian control, including, Meienberg, Reichensee and Willisau. These moves were the immediate cause of war. On 14 January, Lucerne called on the confederates for assistance. A local Austrian force defeated the confederate garrison at Meienberg on 28 January, killing over one hundred and forty Swiss soldiers. An armistice was called on 21 February, and negotiations were held in Zürich. Neither side had any real interest in ending the conflict at this point, and as the armistice ended, the dispute escalated into a full-scale military confrontation.

Duke Leopold gathered his troops at Brugg, consisting of his feudal vassals from Swabia, the Alsace, and Tyrol, as well as troops from Burgundy, Milan, and even England. In the course of a few weeks, no less than 167 noblemen, both secular and of the church, declared war on the Swiss. These declarations were sent to the Swiss diet in 20 packets, in order to increase the effect of shock. On 24 June, a messenger from Württemberg brought 15 declarations of war. Before all letters had been read, the messenger from Pfirt delivered another eight, and before he had finished speaking, letters from the lords of Schaffhausen were brought in. Another eight messengers arrived on the following day.

The gathering of Austrian forces at Brugg suggested an intended attack on Zürich, and the confederate forces moved to protect that city. But Leopold marched south, to Zofingen and on to Willisau, ostensibly with the intention of ravaging the Lucerne countryside and perhaps, ultimately, aiming for the city of Lucerne. The Austrian army had a troop of mowers with them to cut the crops and destroy the harvests along their route. The town of Willisau was plundered and burned, and the army moved on to Sursee on Lake Sempach, and then towards Sempach on 9 July.

Leopold&#x27;s men taunted those behind the walls of the town, and a knight waved a noose at them and promised them he would use it on their leaders. Another mockingly pointed to the soldiers setting fire to the ripe fields of grain, and asked them to send a breakfast to the reapers. From behind the walls, there was a shouted retort: &quot;Lucerne and the allies will bring them breakfast!&quot;

Confederate troops of Lucerne, Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden had marched back from Zürich once it became clear that this was not Leopold&#x27;s target. The forces of Zürich had remained behind defending their own city, while those of Bern had not heeded the confederate call for assistance.

==Battle==

The Confederation army had presumably assembled at the bridge over the Reuss River at Gisikon. It marched from there, hoping to catch Leopold still at Sempach where he could be pressed against the lake. Around noon, the two armies made contact about 2 km outside of Sempach. This was to the mutual surprise of both armies, which were both on the move and not in battle order. But both sides were willing to engage and formed ranks. The site of the battle is marked by the old battle chapel, which was originally consecrated in the year after the battle.

The Swiss held the wooded high ground close to the village of Hildisrieden. Since the terrain was not deemed suitable for a cavalry attack, Leopold&#x27;s knights dismounted, and because they did not have time to prepare for the engagement, they were forced to cut off the tips of their poulaines which would have hindered their movement on foot. The Swiss chroniclers report how a huge pile of these shoe-tips was found after the battle, and they are also depicted in the background of the battle scene in the &quot;Lucerne Chronicle&quot; of 1513.

The main body of the Confederation army finally completed its deployment from the marching column, formed up, and aggressively attacked the knights from the flank. The Austrian force, however, formed a wide rank and threatened to surround the outnumbered confederates.

How and at what point the battle turned in favour of the confederates is a matter of debate.
It has been suggested that an important factor was the midday heat in July, which wore out the Austrian knights wearing heavy armour, much more than the lightly armed confederates (some of which had reportedly no other &quot;armour&quot; than a wooden plank tied to their left arm as a shield). Another factor may have been an underestimation of the confederates on the part of the nobility. According to the account by Tschudi, seeing the small strength of the confederate force, the nobles were concerned that if they sent the mercenaries in front, as would have been common practice, they might not see any action at all, as the mercenaries would finish the job on their own. Therefore, they insisted on taking the front ranks.

Traditional Swiss historiography since the 16th century has attributed the turning of the tide to the heroic deed of Arnold von Winkelried, who opened a breach in the Habsburg lines by throwing himself into their pikes, taking them down with his body so that the confederates could attack through the opening. Winkelried is usually shown as a legendary figure introduced to explain the Swiss victory against the odds, perhaps as late as a full century after the battle. The earliest evidence of the Winkelried legend is the depiction of the battle in the &quot;Lucerne Chronicle&quot; of 1513.

As was the custom and a matter of honour in such a battle, each canton had one of their comrades carry their municipal flag in the lead. One such recorded was Rudolf Hön (today&#x27;s spelling, Höhn, English, Hoehn), who represented Arth, a municipality in the canton of Schwyz.
Volunteering to do this meant that he did not carry a weapon, either to defend himself or attack the enemy. 
Thus, by leading his comrades into battle without a weapon, he diverted the attention of the enemy and sacrificed himself for the intended good of the Confederation.
For posterity, and recognition of the actual deed, Hön&#x27;s name can be seen inscribed twice in the list of fallen on the inner wall of Sempach Battle Chapel (situated next to the battleground). One for being a confederate and the other as a flag bearer. 

The oldest accounts of the battle are unambiguous in the judgement that the Swiss victory was against all odds and expectations, and is attributed to the grace of God.

In any case, the Swiss did break through the Austrian ranks and routed the enemy army completely. Duke Leopold, and with him a large number of nobles and knights, were slain, including several members of the noble families of Aarberg, Baldegg, Bechburg, Büttikon, Eptingen, Falkenstein, Hallwil, Reinach, Rotberg and Wetter.&lt;br&gt;
Another prominent casualty was Otto I, Margrave of Baden-Hachberg.

==Aftermath==
An armistice was agreed upon on 12 October, followed by a peace agreement valid for one year, beginning on 14 January 1387.

The battle was a severe blow to Austrian interests in the region, and allowed for the establishment of Lucerne as a regional capital and further growth of the Old Swiss Confederacy. Already weakened by the 1379 division of Habsburg lands, Leopoldian control of the territories left of the Rhine would collapse over the following years, not least due to the death toll among the local elites loyal to Habsburg. This allowed the confederate cities, especially Lucerne, Bern and Solothurn, an unchecked expansion into the undefended Habsburg lands. Bern, which had not participated in the Sempach war, took the opportunity and began its conquest of what would become the Canton of Bern, sending military expeditions into the cantons of Jura, the Oberland, Emmental and Aargau. Lucerne, by 1389, was able to consolidate its control over the towns around lake Sempach, Willisau and the Entlebuch, largely corresponding to the extent of the modern Canton of Lucerne. Glarus also took the opportunity to rebel against Habsburg control, and established its independence in the Battle of Näfels in 1388. The legend goes that a Bohemian knight received seeds of the flower Calla for his protection when he decided to accompany Duke Leopold. After the battle was lost, the knight hid in a forest, where he was killed. Today, the forest is one of the few places where the Calla is found naturally in Switzerland.

A new peace agreement between the confederacy and Austria was concluded on 1 April 1389, valid for seven years, extended to 20 years on 16 July 1394.

==Legacy==
Not without justification, the Battle of Sempach came to be seen as the decisive turning point between the foundation of the confederacy as a loose pact in the 14th century, and its growth into a significant political and military power during the 15th century. A culture of remembrance formed from the city of Lucerne whose Grand Council ordered in the 1380–1390s to remember the 9 July and that annually for bread to the poor and praise to God and Virgin Mary should be provided with. In the following two decades, the neighboring towns and districts of Lucerne were still held by the Habsburg dynasty and in them, the Habsburgian fallen were remembered in the churchly mass. Only in 1415 Sempach came under control of Lucern. At the peak of the military success of the Eight Cantons in the period of 1470 to 1510, Swiss historiography paid great attention to the Battle of Sempach. It is depicted in the Swiss illustrated chronicles of the period, and discussed by Reformation era historiographers such as Aegidius Tschudi and Wernher Steiner.
Since there are few historiographical accounts of the battle predating 1470, it is difficult to judge the historicity of the individual details. The legend of Arnold Winkelried is recorded in this period, but it cannot be shown to predate 1500.

The battle chapel at Sempach was consecrated already in 1387. The chapel was built by the Habsburgians to remember their fallen and only after the accession of Sempach to Lucerne in 1415, the chapel became known as a place of worship for the Swiss. A yearly mass was celebrated there on the day of the battle. The chapel was repeatedly enlarged. It was decorated with a fresco in 1551, which was restored and enlarged in 1638–1643, 1695, 1741–1743, 1747, and 1886. The current fresco is largely a restoration of the painting of 1643.

Swiss patriotism in the restored Confederacy of 1815–1847 rediscovered the formative phase of the Old Confederacy as a source of national identity. The modern &quot;Sempacherlied&quot; is a product of 1830s patriotism. During the World Wars, the Swiss policy of armed neutrality was also ideologically fueled by reference to the military successes of the medieval confederacy.

Swiss modernist author Robert Walser (1878–1956) recounts the Battle of Sempach in brief but violent detail in his short story &quot;The Battle of Sempach&quot;.

<doc id="422590" wikidata="Q131243" url="?curid=422590" title="Oranjestad, Aruba">
<text>Oranjestad ( , , ; literally &quot;Orange City&quot;), the capital and most populous of Aruba&#x27;s eight regions, is located on the southwestern coast of the island. In Papiamento, the local language, Oranjestad is commonly referred to as &quot;Playa&quot;&quot;&quot; by the locals. 

Administratively, the Oranjestad is divided into two regions: East and West. In 2010, the capital had a population of 28,294, and by 2020, it increased to 28,658.

==History==
Since 1754, European settlers established modest plantations along Aruba&#x27;s south coast and the flat northwestern region, leading to the emergence of the first residential centers. In the early 20th century, the island was divided into four &quot;districts&quot;: the first district, Playa, the second with Noord, the third with Santa Cruz, and the fourth with &quot;Sabaneta&quot; (Savaneta). By 1795 or 1796, as Aruba opened up and trade restrictions eased, urban development commenced. Traders and craftsmen subsequently migrated to the &quot;village by the bay&quot;. Governor Johann Lauffer granted permission to settle at the bay and engage in trade, with the condition that trade goods were sourced from Curaçao.

Jewish settlers in Aruba, likely driven by the economic decline in Curaçao, engaged in smuggling discreetly. Fluent in Spanish, they leveraged their connections with the mainland via the predominantly Jewish-controlled Curaçao trade (see History of the Jews in Curaçao). The Sephardim, facing economic challenges, established independent trading colonies in the Caribbean around 1796, maintaining close links with Curaçao in trade, religion, and marriage. Smuggling played a pivotal role in Jews choosing Aruba as their settlement. Choosing &quot;Paardenbaai&quot; (&quot;Bay of Horses&quot;) as a trading hub, rather than &quot;Commandeursbaai&quot; (&quot;Commander&#x27;s bay&quot;) in Savaneta was influenced by its improved ship accessibility and the ongoing prohibition of trade and settlement east of Hooiberg, which included Commandeursbaai. 

They exported local products like cattle, sheep, poultry, Antillean dyewood (&quot;Haematoxylum brasiletto&quot;), and gold after 1824. However, the primary trade involved importing goods from Curaçao, which were then smuggled ashore using small vessels along the Venezuelan coast, in Coro, and nearby areas. Imports encompassed items such as food, clothing, tools, and more. Additionally, red slaves were transported from the mainland.
Illegal trade from Paardenbaai spurred the growth of Playa village. The command&#x27;s relocation played a key role in this development. Although the exact date of the commander&#x27;s move to Playa is unknown, Fort Zoutman was erected in 1798, marking a significant period when traders shifted from Ponton to Paardenbaai. Following the commander&#x27;s arrival, milestones in the village&#x27;s early history included the construction of the first Catholic church, between 1800 and 1810 and the arrival of the initial Protestant religious instructor, Klaas van Eekhout, in 1822 were milestones in the early history of the village. The trade boom, however, saw a decline around 1822 or 1823 due to a civil war, during which Simon Bolivar and the independence movement expelled the Spaniards from South America. Similar to Curaçao, trade dwindled, but a new drive for Aruban colonization emerged—the discovery of gold in 1824. During the visit of Governor Paulus Roelof Cantz&#x27;laar in 1824, the village was named Oranjestad after William I of the Netherlands.

In 1805, Paardenbaai had 32 houses, which increased to 185 by 1824 and 196 by 1832. The village was described in 1837 as &quot;of great size but so irregularly built that it resembles more a heap of scattered houses than anything that can be called a city&quot;. In 1860, approximately 1,000 out of Aruba&#x27;s 2,849 inhabitants resided in the capital. 

In Oranjestad-west, the &quot;Ranchoe&quot; (or &quot;Rancho&quot;) area formed a distinct neighborhood where the majority of the island&#x27;s fishing population resided. In 1837, the &quot;Socotoro&quot;, a governmental plantation, cultivated cochineal known for its carmine-red dye, and by 1845 Socotoro was allocated for aloe cultivation. Socotoro was not the sole plantation or area in Oranjestad to have cultivated the cochineal mites; Companashi, Mon Plaisir, and Sividivi were also included.

The establishment of the Lago Oil and Transport Company and Arend Petroleum Company, oil refineries, not only led to a population increase but also brought about a significant increase in prosperity for Oranjestad. In Oranjestad along Paardenbaai, residents included traders, shopkeepers, and craftsmen. A select few, with larger pieces of land, ships, and shops, constituted the wealthier class. However, excessive wealth was rare. City houses usually resembled those in the districts. Notably luxurious city houses emerged in the period following the arrival of the oil industry (), as the business elite capitalized on the economic boost brought about by the oil industry.

== Geography ==
In terms of geomorphology, Oranjestad is situated on limestone sediments from the Early Miocene, dating back to approximately 24 Ma. The city also includes man-made expansion into the sea, featuring notable areas such as the Renaissance Marketplace (formerly Seaport Marketplace) and Queen Wilhelmina Park situated on reclaimed land. Additionally, the Important Bird Area MPA Oranjestad Reef Islands is located adjacent to the main harbor.

=== Regions and zones ===
Aruba is categorized into 8 regions, each with its respective zones. Oranjestad is further divided into two regions: Oranjestad West and Oranjestad East, each comprising 8 zones.

*Oranjestad West
** Pos Abou / Cunucu Abou
** Eagle / Paardenbaai 
** Madiki Kavel
** Madiki / Rancho
** Paradijswijk / Santa Helena
** Socotoro / Rancho
** Ponton
** Companashi / Solito

*Oranjestad East
** Nassaustraat
** Klip / Mon Plaisir
** Sividivi
** Sero Blanco / Cumana
** Dakota / Potrero 
** Tarabana
** Sabana Blanco / Mahuma
** Simeon Antonio
=== Climate ===
Oranjestad has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSh&quot;). Temperatures are high year-round, the air is humid with low diurnal temperature variation also year-round, whilst rainfall is very low due to the region lying in a zone of divergence between the southeast trade winds to the south and the North American Monsoon further north. The exception to this aridity occurs during the short rainy season from September to January when the southward retreat of the Intertropical Convergence Zone generates more frequent moist northeasterly winds.

==Culture==

There is some Dutch Colonial architecture. Due to increased government interest in maintaining the island&#x27;s cultural heritage, a number of old buildings and houses in the center of town have been transformed into colorfully restored landmarks, such as the lime-colored City Hall on Wilhelminastraat.

===Sports===
Oranjestad is home to the football teams SV Dakota, SV Racing Club Aruba, and SV River Plate Aruba, all of which play in the top Aruban Division di Honor.

==Economy==
Air Aruba once had its headquarters in Oranjestad. Air Aruba suspended its operations on 23 October 2000.

Tiara Air has had its head office in Oranjestad since 2006, except between 2014 and 2016 when the company suspended services due to the Venezuelan Airline Crisis.

===Tourism===
Several modern recreations have emerged, including the outdoor shopping mall at Royal Plaza, and a few scattered buildings along Main Street and on the Main Square.

The late 18th century Fort Zoutman is one of the town&#x27;s main attractions and the oldest structure on Aruba. It is regarded by UNESCO as a &#x27;Place of Memory of the Slave Trade Route in the Latin Caribbean&#x27;. Others attractions on the island include the tax-free harbour and the Willem III Tower, located near the fort. 

There are about eight museums on the island.

===Renaissance Island===
The touristically named Renaissance Island (formerly Sonesta Island) is a cay (or barrier reef) island, officially known as the Bucuti Rif and it is off the coast near Oranjestad. It is privately owned and has the only private beaches on Aruba. There are two beaches: Iguana Beach and Flamingo Beach. A Beechcraft 18 and a Convair 400 were both deliberately sunk about offshore to create a diving site. Flamingoes can be seen on the island. However, they are not native to Aruba.

==Transport==


Oranjestad is conveniently connected to the Queen Beatrix International Airport, located from the city center. The downtown area is serviced by a tramway line.

&quot;Caya G. F. Betico Croes&quot;, commonly known as Main Street or &quot;Caya&quot;, serves as Aruba&#x27;s primary shopping destination in Oranjestad. However, in recent years, shoppers have increasingly favored Lloyd G. Smith Boulevard, the city&#x27;s main thoroughfare. This shift is partly due to the boulevard&#x27;s proximity to the cruise ship terminal ad harbour area.

Paardenbaai is the largest passenger port on the island, accommodating up to five vessels. For cargo vessels, there&#x27;s a port at Barcadera, situated to the east. Plans are underway to enhance loading capacity at Oranjestad, including the construction of a marina to address the insufficient docking space for yachts and fishing boats.

== Education ==
Oranjestad is home to the University of Aruba, which offers programs in law and economics, and to the island&#x27;s largest secondary school (&quot;Colegio Arubano&quot;), both modeled on the Dutch system. Many students enroll in universities in the Netherlands for graduate and postgraduate degrees.

==People==
*Dave Benton, winner of the Eurovision Song Contest 2001 for Estonia
*Xander Bogaerts, baseball player, two-time World Series champion
*Bobby Farrell, singer, Boney M
*Vince Irie, singer-songwriter
*Chadwick Tromp, baseball player, Atlanta Braves

<text>Forensic dentistry or forensic odontology involves the handling, examination, and evaluation of dental evidence in a criminal justice context. Forensic dentistry is used in both criminal and civil law. Forensic dentists assist investigative agencies in identifying human remains, particularly in cases when identifying information is otherwise scarce or nonexistent—for instance, identifying burn victims by consulting the victim&#x27;s dental records. Forensic dentists may also be asked to assist in determining the age, race, occupation, previous dental history, and socioeconomic status of unidentified human beings.

Forensic dentists may make their determinations by using radiographs, ante- and post-mortem photographs, and DNA analysis. Another type of evidence that may be analyzed is bite marks, whether left on the victim (by the attacker), the perpetrator (from the victim of an attack), or on an object found at the crime scene. However, this latter application of forensic dentistry has proven highly controversial, as no scientific studies or evidence substantiate that bite marks can demonstrate sufficient detail for positive identification and numerous instances where experts diverge widely in their evaluations of the same bite mark evidence.

Bite mark analysis has been condemned by several scientific bodies, such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), National Academy of Sciences (NAS), the President&#x27;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST), and the Texas Forensic Science Commission.

==Training==

===India===
In India, certificate courses offered include a modular course by D. Y. Patil Vidyapeeth, Pune, and some other private entities. The Indian Dental Association offers a fellowship program in FO which can be either a classroom program or an online program. Master&#x27;s degree programs in different forensic disciplines along with M.Sc. Forensic Odontology is offered by National Forensic Sciences University which is the world&#x27;s only university dedicated to forensic sciences.
It is a 2‑year full‑time course offered at the university&#x27;s campus at Gandhinagar.

===Australia===
Postgraduate diploma programs for dentists are available at The University of Melbourne, The University of Western Australia, and The University of Adelaide.

===Belgium===
The Belgian university KU Leuven offers a master&#x27;s in Forensic Odontology.

===United Kingdom===
Following the closure of the MSc course at the University of Glamorgan, one can receive either an MSc in Forensic Dentistry (a one-year programme) or a Masters in Forensic Odontology (a two-year programme) from the University of Dundee in Scotland, which currently has a very limited intake.

=== United States ===
There are two odontology training programs available in the US. One is a Fellowship program at The University of Texas Health Science at San Antonio Center Dental School, and the other is a master&#x27;s degree program through the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture College of Veterinary Medicine.

=== Canada ===
For undergraduate studies, dental school candidates in Canada are required to complete a BA or at least three years of study in a BA program before completing a dental degree. BA Programs often involve science or biomedical but can include much more, as long as students have completed the basic prerequisites needed.

There are no graduate study programs for forensic odontology specifically in Canada. Some universities have offered some involvement in forensic science disciples during clinical dental specialty projects, however, they will not graduate with credibility in the forensic odontology discipline.

Dental degrees given by universities in Canada include DDS (doctor of dental science) and DMD (doctor of dental medicine).

There is no professional certification process for forensic odontologists in Canada currently. It is possible for Canadians to certify for the ABFO, a section of the American Academy of Forensic Science. This process also includes an examination as well as the candidates must complete a career checklist of accomplishments which will be reviewed. This checklist may include fellowships, working with recognized medicolegal death investigation agencies, completing a minimum level of casework and research, and providing testimony in court cases. The ABFO and the AAFS often hold scientific sessions which offer workshops including identification, civil litigation, age determination, and bite-mark analysis. These are beneficial in helping prospective forensic practitioners move towards board-eligible status.

In Ontario, there is a group of 10 forensic dentists that are known as the Province of Ontario Dental Identification Team or better known as PODIT.

==High-profile criminal cases==
Forensic odontology has played a key role in famous criminal cases:

In 1692, during the Salem Witch Trials, Rev. George Burroughs was accused of witchcraft and conspiring with the Devil, with biting his victims supposedly being evidence of his crimes. His bite marks and the bite marks of other people were compared to the victim&#x27;s marks. The judges readily accepted the bite marks as evidence and this was the first time in what would become the United States that bite marks were used as evidence to solve a crime. He was later convicted and hanged. About two decades later, he was exonerated by the State, and his children were compensated for the wrongful execution.

One of the first published accounts involving a conviction based on bite marks as evidence was the “Gorringe case”, in 1948, in which pathologist Keith Simpson used bite marks on the breast of the victim to seal a murder conviction against Robert Gorringe for the murder of his wife Phyllis. Another early case was &quot;Doyle v. State&quot;, which occurred in Texas in 1954. The bite mark, in this case, was on a piece of cheese found at the crime scene of a burglary. The defendant was later asked to bite another piece of cheese for comparison. A firearms examiner and a dentist evaluated the bite marks independently and both concluded that the marks were made by the same set of teeth. The conviction, in this case, set the stage for bite marks found on objects and skin to be used as evidence in future cases.

Another landmark case was &quot;People v. Marx&quot;, which occurred in California in 1975. A woman was murdered by strangulation after being sexually assaulted. She was bitten several times on her nose. Walter Marx was identified as a suspect and dental impressions were made of his teeth. Impressions and photographs were also taken of the woman&#x27;s injured nose. These samples along with other models and casts were evaluated using a variety of techniques, including two-dimensional and three-dimensional comparisons, and acetate overlays. Three experts testified that the bite marks on the woman&#x27;s nose were indeed made by Marx and he was convicted of voluntary manslaughter.
* Fredrik Fasting Torgersen
* Wayne Boden – an early case of Forensic Dentistry
* State of Florida v. Ted Bundy
* State of New Jersey v. Jesse Timmendequas (Megan&#x27;s Law case)
* People of California v. Marx, the 1975 case which established evidentiary standards for forensic odontology
* People of Arizona v. Ray Krone, bite mark evidence led to a wrongful conviction.

== Organizations ==
Several organizations are dedicated to the field of forensic odontology. These organizations include the Bureau of Legal Dentistry (BOLD), the American Board of Forensic Odontology (ABFO), American Society of Forensic Odontology (ASFO), the International Organization for Forensic Odonto-Stomatology (IOFOS) and the Association Forensic Odontology For Human Rights (AFOHR). Countries have their own forensic Odontological societies, including the British Association for Forensic Odontology (BAFO) and the Australian Society of Forensic Odontology (AuSFO). In 1996, BOLD was created at the University of British Columbia to develop new technology and techniques in forensic odontology. The University of British Columbia program is the only one in North America that provides graduate training in forensic odontology.

In Canada, The Royal College of Dentists has not recognized forensic odontology therefore there is no organization for Canada, however, there are three well-developed and trained groups for forensic dentistry. These groups include British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec. British Columbia has a team called BC Forensic Odontology Response Team (BC_FORT) which is led by six dentists. They focus on disaster-victim identification work. Ontario has a team of ten forensic dentists called the Province of Ontario Dental Identification Team (PODIT). Quebec has a team that is run out of McGill University and they offer a well-established forensic dentistry online course that focuses on human bite-mark evidence. These teams are kept small in order to maintain a relationship between forensic dentists and casework.

The Bureau of Legal Dentistry encourages the use of multiple dental impressions to create a “dental lineup”, similar to a suspect lineup used to identify alleged perpetrators of crime. Currently, dental impressions collected as evidence are compared only to those collected from a given suspect, which may bias the resulting outcome. Using multiple dental impressions in a lineup may enable forensic odontologists to significantly decrease the current bias in matching bite marks to the teeth of a suspect. The organization BOLD also supports the creation of a database of dental records, which could help in verifying dental uniqueness. This database could be created using criminal records or possibly all dental patients.

In 1984, the ABFO attempted to diminish the discrepancies and increase the validity of bite mark analysis by creating bite mark methodology guidelines. The guidelines attempt to establish standard terminology in describing bite marks and that reduces the risk of biased results. The ABFO also provides advice on how to effectively collect and preserve evidence. For example, they recommend that the collection of DNA evidence and detailed photographs of bites be taken together at the crime scene. The guidelines also outline how and what a forensic odontologist should record, such as the location, contours, shape, and size of a bite mark. They also provide a system of scoring to assess the degree to which a suspect&#x27;s dental profile and bite mark match. According to the ABFO, the guidelines are not a mandate of methods to be used, but a list of generally accepted methods.

The guidelines are intended to prevent potentially useful evidence from being thrown out simply because the forensic odontologist&#x27;s collection methods were not standardized. Kouble and Craig used a simplified version of the ABFO scoring guidelines in order to retain accuracy with a larger sample of comparisons. A numerical score was assigned to represent the degree of similarity between the bite mark and model/overlay. The higher the score, the greater the similarity. In order to simplify the model, some features that were individually scored in the ABFO guidelines such as arch size and shape were assessed together while certain distinctive features such as spacing between teeth were treated as a separate variable. The authors believe that a simplified version would increase the strength of the comparison process. In an attempt to improve guidelines used to collect dental evidence, IOFOS developed one of the most recognized systems for the collection of forensic dental evidence

There is only one international association promoting humanitarian forensic odontology, called AFOHR. It was inaugurated in 2015 by a group of experts in Lyon during the Interpol DVI annual meeting, following the inspiration of Emilio Nuzzolese, forensic odontologist from Italy. In 2019 the group evolved into Association adopting a by Laws and an elected Board.

In 2016, an association of civil protection called Dental Team DVI Italia was founded in Bari, Italy, in order to offer pro bono services in the field of human identification and DVI Disaster Victim Identification to support Italian DVI teams.

==Bite mark analysis==
A bite mark is defined as a change in a surface&#x27;s appearance due to the teeth coming into contact with it, leaving behind a dental pattern of the bite. Studies have been performed in an attempt to find the simplest, most efficient, and most reliable way of analyzing bite marks and comparing them with one another and with suspects&#x27; teeth. There are two important notions when it comes to bite mark analysis: every individual has unique dentition that can be identifiable and this uniqueness can be found in a bite mark left in human skin. The theory behind bite mark analysis has been called into doubt in recent years, with many observers considering the entire field unscientific and invalid and calling for bite mark evidence to be inadmissible in court.

=== Proposed theoretical basis ===
Bites can occur on both the victim and the suspect; teeth are used as a weapon by the aggressor and in self-defense by the victim. Although they are only a small portion of most forensic dentists&#x27; caseload, bite marks represent the most challenging aspect of the discipline. In addition to the location of the bite mark, the type of severity of the injury may give investigators clues as to the mental state of the offender. Bite marks may be found on the flesh of victims of a violent attack, particularly on the stomach or buttocks. Bite mark evidence may be the only form of physical evidence found on a body. Alternatively, they may be found on the suspect, left by the victim during self-defense. Bite marks can be altered through stretching, movement, or change in environment after the bite. Skin is not ideal for holding the shape of a bite mark as it can become distorted due to the viscoelasticity of the skin. There is also no set standard by which to analyze and compare bite marks.

Factors that may affect the accuracy of bite mark identification include time-dependent changes of the bite mark on living bodies, effects of where the bite mark was found, damage on soft tissue, and similarities in dentition among individuals. Other factors include poor photography, impressions, or measurement of dentition characteristics.

Most bite mark analysis studies use porcine skin (pigskin), because it is comparable to the skin of a human, and it is considered unethical to bite a human for study in the United States. Limitations to the bite mark studies include differences in properties of pigskin compared to human skin and the technique of using simulated pressures to create bite marks. Although similar histologically, pigskin and human skin behave in dynamically different ways due to differences in elasticity. Furthermore, postmortem bites on nonhuman skin, such as those used in the experiments of Martin-de-las Heras et al., display different patterns to those seen in antemortem bite injuries. In recognition of the limitations of their study, Kouble and Craig suggest using a G-clamp on an articulator in future studies to standardize the amount of pressure used to produce experimental bite marks instead of applying manual pressure to models on pigskin. Future research and technological developments may help reduce the occurrence of such limitations.

Kouble and Craig compared direct methods and indirect methods of bite mark analysis. In the past, the direct method compared a model of the suspect&#x27;s teeth to a life-size photograph of the actual bite mark. In these experiments, direct comparisons were made between dental models and either photographs or &quot;fingerprint powder lift models.&quot; The &quot;fingerprint powder lift&quot; technique involves dusting the bitten skin with black fingerprint powder and using fingerprint tape to transfer the bite marks onto a sheet of acetate. Indirect methods involve the use of transparent overlays to record a suspect&#x27;s biting edges. Transparent overlays are made by free-hand tracing the occlusal surfaces of a dental model onto an acetate sheet. When comparing the “fingerprint powder lift” technique against the photographs, the use of photographs resulted in higher scores determined by a modified version of the ABFO scoring guidelines. The use of transparent overlays is considered subjective and irreproducible because the tracing can be easily manipulated. On the other hand, photocopier-generated overlays where no tracing is used are considered to be the best method in matching the correct bite mark to the correct set of models without the use of computer imaging.

While the photocopier-generated technique is sensitive, reliable, and inexpensive, new methods involving digital overlays have proven to be more accurate. Two recent technological developments include the 2D polyline method and the painting method. Both methods use Adobe Photoshop. The use of the 2D polyline method entails drawing straight lines between two fixed points in the arch and between incisal edges to indicate the tooth width. The use of the painting method entails coating the incisal edges of a dental model with red glossy paint and then photographing the model. Adobe Photoshop is then used to make measurements on the image. A total of 13 variables were used in the analysis. Identification for both methods was based on canine-to-canine distance (one variable), incisor width (four variables), and rotational angles of the incisors (eight variables). The 2D polyline method relies heavily on accurate measurements, while the painting method depends on the precise overlaying of the images. Although both methods were reliable, the 2D polyline method gave efficient and more objective results.

===Criticism of bite mark analysis===
Bite mark analysis has been criticized by the President&#x27;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST). The PCAST has identified that bite mark analysis is an area which lacks clear standards in regards to the features needed to identify a particular set of dentition as having created a particular mark. The analysis of bite marks is subjective and is highly criticized.

So called bite mark analysis has been criticized as largely unscientific based on three pillars of critique: 
* &quot;Human anterior dental patterns have not been shown to be unique at the individual level&quot;
* &quot;Those patterns are not accurately transferred to human skin consistently&quot;
* &quot;It has not been shown that defining characteristics of those patterns can be accurately analyzed to exclude or not exclude individuals as the source of a [&quot;sic&quot;] bitemark&quot;

Recently, the scientific foundation of forensic odontology, and especially bite mark comparison, has been called into question. A 1999 study by a member of the American Board of Forensic Odontology found a 63% rate of false identifications. However, the study was based on an informal workshop during an ABFO meeting which many members did not consider a valid scientific setting. In February 2016, the Texas Forensic Science Commission recommended that bite mark evidence not be used in criminal prosecutions until it had a more firm scientific basis. That same year, the President&#x27;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology declared that bite mark analysis had no scientific validity.

An investigative series by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; entitled &quot;Forensics under the Microscope&quot; examined many forensic science disciplines to see if they truly deserve the air of infallibility that has come to surround them. The investigators concluded that bite mark comparison is always subjective and no standards for comparison have been accepted across the field. The journalists discovered that no rigorous experimentation has been conducted to determine error rates for bite mark comparison, a key part of the scientific method.

Critics of bite mark comparison cite the case of Ray Krone, an Arizona man convicted of murder on bite mark evidence left on a woman&#x27;s breast. DNA evidence later implicated another man and Krone was released from prison. Similarly, Roy Brown was convicted of murder due in part to bite-mark evidence, and freed after DNA testing of the saliva left in the bite wounds matched someone else.

Although bite mark analysis has been used in legal proceedings since 1870, it remains a controversial topic due to a variety of factors. DeVore and Barbenel and Evans have shown that the accuracy of a bite mark on the skin is limited at best. Skin is not a good medium for dental impressions; it is liable to several of irregularities present before the imprint that could cause distortion. Also, bite marks can be altered through stretching, movement, or a changing environment during and after the actual bite. Furthermore, the level of distortion tends to increase after the bite mark was made. Both studies suggest that for the bite mark to be accurately analyzed, the body must be examined in the same position it was in when the bite occurred, which can be a difficult if the not impossible task to accomplish. Bite mark distortion can rarely be quantified. Therefore, bite marks found at the scene are often analyzed under the assumption that they have undergone minimal distortion. Only limited research has been done in trying to quantify the level of distortion of a bite mark on human skin since the 1970s. The lack of research may largely be because such studies are difficult to organize and are very expensive.

Bite mark analysis is also controversial because dental profiles are subject to change. The loss of teeth or the alteration of arch configuration through a variety of procedures is common in human populations. The onset of oral diseases such as dental caries has been shown to alter the arch and tooth configuration and must be taken into account when comparing a dental profile to the bite mark after a significant amount of time has passed since the mark was made.

While the methods behind collecting bite mark evidence at the scene are leading toward greater standardization, the methodology behind analyzing bite marks is extremely variable because it depends upon the preference of the specific odontologist. As discussed earlier, there are several methods used to compare bite marks ranging from life-sized photographs to computer-enhanced three-dimensional imaging. These methods vary in precision and accuracy, and there is no set standard by which to compare or analyze them. The lack of analytical standards leads to a wide array of interpretations with any bite mark evidence. Some odontologists even disagree on whether or not a mark on the body is the result of a bite. Therefore, the interpretation of evidence lies largely on the expertise of the forensic odontologist handling the case.

One possible issue facing bite mark analysis is a lack of bite mark uniqueness in any given population. Bite mark analysis is based on the assumption that the dental characteristics of anterior teeth involved in biting are unique amongst individuals, and this asserted uniqueness is transferred and recorded in the injury. However, there is very little reliable research to support these assumptions. A study performed by MacFarlane et al. supported the notion of dental uniqueness, but the study revolved around the visual assessment of a cast as opposed to the bite mark that could have been produced by the cast. In another study conducted by Sognnaes et al., the group tried to find uniqueness between the dental profiles of identical twins in an attempt to prove dental uniqueness in the general population. However, this study suffered from a small sample size (n=5), with the intent to extrapolate the data to the general population. They also used plaster of Paris as the substrate to simulate skin, yet the two materials have very different properties. In a review conducted by Strom, he references a study conducted by Berg and Schaidt which suggested that at least four to five teeth need to be present in the mark to ensure its uniqueness and make an identification. However, this study was done long before many of the current evaluation methods, and this sheds doubt on how applicable these conclusions are today.

Rawson et al. determined that if five teeth marks can be matched to five teeth, it can be said with confidence that only one person could have caused the bite, and if eight teeth were matched to marks this would be a certainty. However, in this study, the probabilities used to make this claim are based on the assumption that the position of each tooth was independent of all the others. This is probably unrealistic because there are several ways that the dental profile can be changed. For example, braces apply force to specific teeth, in order to shift the placement of multiple teeth.

One particular case that highlighted the lack of uniqueness in bite marks involved two suspects accused of attacking a man who had sustained a bite mark injury. Two separate forensic dentists, one representing the prosecution and one the defense, were brought in to analyze the mark. They reported conflicting results. One found the mark to come from suspect A and the other said it was from suspect B. This disagreement resulted from the fact that even though the two suspects had dental features making them unique, the bite mark itself was not detailed enough to reflect them. Therefore, the mark could have reasonably come from either of the men. The equivocal outcome demonstrated in the case emphasizes the difficulty in proving uniqueness.

Most of the controversies facing bite mark analysis are due to the lack of empirical supporting evidence. When searching the entire MedLine database from 1960 to 1999, only 50 papers in English were found that related to bite mark analysis. Of these 50 papers, most of which were published in the 1980s, only 8% came from well designed experimentation providing empirical data. The lack of research has led to the continued use of a few outdated and limited studies to support the validity of bite mark analysis. This brings into question whether or not there is enough scientific support for bite mark analysis to be employed in court.

There have been several instances when forensic dentists have made claims, accusations, and guarantees supported by bite mark evaluation that have been proven incorrect through other forensic sciences. DNA analysis has shed some light on the limitations of bite mark analysis because often the DNA from saliva surrounding the area of the bite mark proves to be a more reliable form of identification. In the case of &quot;Mississippi vs. Bourne&quot;, the DNA of a suspect excluded them from the crime after a dentist claimed the bite marks on the victim matched the defendant&#x27;s teeth. DNA sampling has been included as a task for a forensic odontologist. For a crime scene investigator, taking DNA samples is as common as taking pictures of the scene. In the case of &quot;State vs. Krone&quot;, the defendant was sentenced to death, which was overturned. Then Krone was later reconvicted and given life in prison. Both convictions were based largely on bite mark evidence, but ten years later DNA evidence surfaced that identified the real killer and Krone was set free.

Bite marks were a primary source of evidence in the wrongful convictions of Keith Allen Harward, Kennedy Brewer and Levon Brooks. The role of bite marks in their convictions is told in a Netflix series titled The Innocence Files

==Age estimation==
The estimation of an individual&#x27;s age category becomes crucial in various forensic contexts; such as crime scenes, accidents, mass disasters, and the potential identification of an unknown individual. In determining an approximation of the latter, it is imperative to be aware of the variety of methods utilized in different situations. The most reliable analysis regarding age estimation is a clinical or visual approach. This includes a noninvasive examination of he tooth&#x27;s eruption rate, as well as the degenerative modifications upon the teeth. These alterations can be present under forms of attrition. The abrasions manufactured from attrition can lead to a proximate age range of the individual. Not only can the age of a human specimen be narrowed by evaluating the patterns of tooth eruption and tooth wear, but recent studies also provide evidence that cementum, the mineralized tissue that lines the surface of tooth roots, exhibits annual patterns of deposition. Aggrawal has presented a comprehensive account.

In this regard, it should be underlined that age estimation in forensic cases, in contrast to clinical situation, is required to be of optimal accuracy, as potential over- or underestimation of age might lead to a failure of justice.

Adult dentition can be differentiated from juvenile dentition in bite mark analysis by determining the quantity of teeth. Juvenile teeth are considered primary teeth while adult are considered permanent teeth. Twenty teeth will be present by the age of two years old. Thirty-two teeth will be present by the age of twenty-one, with the last ones being the wisdom teeth. By analyzing the quantity of teeth in a bite mark, this can assist with determining the age of the individual.

== Sex estimation ==
The determination of sex is important in the identification of unknown individuals in both forensic and archaeological contexts. The preferred anatomical methods for sex determination are based on pelvic and cranio-facial morphology. Using these parts of the skeleton, males and females can be correctly classified with over 90% accuracy. However, these skeletal elements are sometimes recovered in a fragmentary state, rendering sex estimation difficult. Moreover, there is currently no reliable method of sex determination of juvenile or sub-adult remains from cranial or post-cranial skeletal elements since dimorphic traits only become apparent after puberty, and this represents a fundamental problem in forensic investigations. In such situations, teeth are potentially useful in sex determination. Due to their hardness, they are highly resistant to taphonomic processes and are much more likely to be recovered than other parts of the fact, the enamel present on teeth is the hardest biological substance in the human body; therefore making them extremely sustainable analytical evidence in a forensic context. Moreover, teeth may be particularly useful for sexing immature skeletal remains since both primary and permanent sets of teeth develop before puberty.

For several decades research has been conducted into human dental sexual dimorphism, looking at different tooth classes, and using various techniques and measurements, to try to establish the extent of any dimorphism and find criteria or patterns that might enable accurate sexing of unknown individuals. Most of these studies have focused on sexual dimorphism in crown-size dimensions. This research has established that human teeth are sexually dimorphic and, although males and females exhibit overlapping dimensions, there are significant differences in mean values. Sexual dimorphism has been observed in both deciduous and permanent dentition, although it is much less in deciduous teeth. On average, male teeth are slightly larger than female teeth, with the greatest difference observed in the canine teeth. Research using microtomographic scans to look at internal dental tissues has also shown that male teeth consist of significantly greater quantities of dentine than female teeth. This results in female teeth having thicker enamel, on average. Researchers have attempted to use statistical techniques such as discriminant functions or logistic regression equations based on these sex differences to estimate the usefulness of such formulae is uncertain because sexual dimorphism in teeth may vary between populations. The advanced methods which amplify the DNA by using Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) give 100% success in sex determination. Sex estimation based on dentition remains experimental and has yet to gain widespread acceptance. Nevertheless, it offers potentially useful additional techniques that could be used alongside more established methods.

== Identification methods ==

=== Radiograph comparison ===
The comparison of antemortem and post-mortem radiographic records can be done to attain a positive identification of an individual. Teeth are used since they are a very durable and resistant to extreme conditions. The radiographs can present dental restorations as well as unique morphology for each individual. Dental patterns are unique due to the variety of treatments as well as growth for each individual, which creates a benefit in using them for human identification

Post-mortem radiographs can be taken at the scene or in a laboratory, the antemortem records are collected from dentists’ existing files and are used for comparison with the radiographs taken from the deceased unknown individual.

It is important that dentists keep all radiographs stored properly since the original dental records will be used during this comparison.

The antemortem and post-mortem radiographs will both be analyzed and transcribed onto Victim Identification forms and loaded into a computer database in order to compare many different antemortem records to the post-mortem in order to obtain a match.

Radiograph comparison is often a method used in mass fatalities for example natural disasters but It can be used in any case.

=== DNA extraction ===
Teeth contain a great source of DNA since they are very chemically and physically resistant to extreme conditions. This method is especially useful in cases where other DNA sources are not accessible, for example in burned victims. Teeth can be used to create a DNA profile in order to identify unknown deceased individuals. Dentin and enamel provide a resistant and protective surface that houses the dental pulp which is located under the enamel and dentin layers in the center of the tooth, which contains the nerves and blood supply as well. Within the pulp is where genomic and mitochondrial DNA can be extracted. The teeth should not be completely destroyed using DNA analysis alone, it should be compared with other techniques as well before damaging techniques are used.

=== Smile photographs comparison ===
In cases where the body is in an advanced stage of decomposition, such as in cases of skeletal remains and charring, and considering the difficulties or impossibility of using fingerprint analysis and the high cost of DNA testing, forensic dentistry can play an important role in identification.

The most common means used for ante-mortem comparison are X-rays, dental models, and dental records. However, there are cases where the presumed victim never visited a dentist or the family cannot obtain the aforementioned sources, complicating the odontolegal identification of the victim. Another source of comparison can be photographs of the presumed victim&#x27;s smile (ante-mortem) compared to photographs of the deceased person&#x27;s smile (post-mortem), which can highlight the dental characteristics present and, if consistent, confirm the victim&#x27;s identification.

However, it is important to pay attention to details that are important in the process, such as the techniques that will be used for the comparison. Two main techniques are generally employed (both of which require the forensic dentist to take photographs of the deceased person&#x27;s smile, which can then be compared to the ante-mortem photographs):

* Direct comparison of the characteristics presents in the ante-mortem photograph with the observed characteristics in the deceased person. In this technique, the ante-mortem and post-mortem photographs must be paired, and the dental characteristics found should be compared, described, and noted.
* Computerized outlining of the incisal edges of the teeth in the ante-mortem and post-mortem photographs. In this technique, the expert analyzes the morphology of the smile line, delineating the incisal edges and comparing them.

To achieve this, attention must be given to important details, such as:

* Both the ante-mortem and post-mortem photographs need to be as clear as possible, with good/excellent quality.
* The post-mortem photograph should be taken at the same angle of incidence as the ante-mortem photograph.
* The more visible teeth in the ante-mortem photograph, the better. Therefore, selecting the best photograph obtained is important.
* The use of software to annotate the characteristics present in the ante-mortem and post-mortem photographs, facilitating the visualization of comparative elements for everyone, including laypeople.

It is important to emphasize that each person&#x27;s smile is unique, just like fingerprints, palatal rugae, and DNA. Therefore, when properly applied with the necessary scientific rigor, identification through photographs of the smile becomes a reliable method to establish an identification 

=== Palatal rugoscopy comparison ===
This method of identification involves the analysis and comparison of palatal rugae from the deceased with the palatal rugae of the potential victim. One way to perform this comparison is by creating a mold of the upper arch of the deceased (capturing the palatal rugae) or using a complete upper denture that belonged to the deceased, or on a plaster model for dental purposes, and in an object containing the palatal rugae of the missing person during their lifetime (such as an old complete upper denture in possession of the family). Once the two plaster models are created, they should be scanned/photographed, and a computerized delineation of the palatal rugae should be performed, analyzing each individual ruga and comparing their location, shape, and pattern in each of the photos (of the models).

If there is a match, the victim can be identified. It is important to note that the use of dentures for this identification can be done if the palatal rugae are clearly visible. The impression of palatal rugae in dental prostheses is formed over several years of use by the individual. This method has a significant impact on the identification process, particularly when other methodologies and identification techniques cannot be implemented.

<doc id="422593" wikidata="Q309999" url="?curid=422593" title="Humpback dolphin">
<text>Humpback dolphins are members of the genus Sousa. These dolphins are characterized by the conspicuous humps and elongated dorsal fins found on the backs of adults of the species. Humpback dolphins inhabit shallow nearshore waters along coastlines across Australia, Africa, and Asia. Their preference for these habitats exposes them to various human activities such as fisheries entanglement, boat traffic, pollution, and habitat loss. Despite these risks, their nearshore presence facilitates easy observation from land. 

There are four recognized species: the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (&quot;Sousa chinensis&quot;), Indian Ocean humpback dolphin &quot;(S. plumbea&quot;), Atlantic humpback dolphin &quot;(S. teuszii&quot;), and Australian humpback dolphin &quot;(S. sahulensis&quot;). 

Although generally shy and less active compared to bottlenose dolphins, they are occasionally featured in dolphin watching tours, particularly in locations like Hong Kong and the Musandam Peninsula of Oman.

==Description==
The humpback dolphin is a coastal species found from Africa and India south to Australia, with variations in different regions. It has a distinctive hump in front of its dorsal fin and a keel on its belly. The dorsal fin is somewhat curved. Its pectoral fins are relatively small, and the tail flukes have a noticeable notch in the middle. Each side of its jaw has 30 to 34 small, cone-shaped teeth. 

They feature a long rostrum, which constitutes 6.3–10.1% of their body length. Their bodies are robust, tapering towards the rear, with distinct keels on both the dorsal and ventral sides of the caudal peduncle across all age groups.

Neonatal lengths in South African waters range from 97 to 108 cm, with maximum recorded lengths up to 2.8 m. Among Sousa species, Sousa plumbea is the largest, with reported lengths exceeding 3.0 m in the Arabian and Indian regions, although some dispute these reports. 

Southern African dolphin calves have a lighter coloration compared to adults. Calves exhibit pale grey coloration on their flanks with a whiter ventral side, transitioning to darker grey on their back and upper flukes. A diffuse grey stripe runs from the eye towards the flipper, while the dorsal and ventral keels of the caudal peduncle appear off-white. This color pattern persists into adulthood but darkens over time, with some of the largest adults showing white areas on the dorsal fin and hump. Many individuals exhibit prominent scars on their dorsal fin and back, believed to result from unsuccessful shark attacks.

The species is characterized by smaller organ weights, indicating it is a shallow-diving, relatively slow-moving coastal delphinid compared to species like the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) and long-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus capensis). Research has been most extensive in South African populations in Algoa Bay and Richards Bay, although these may not fully represent other populations in the subregion.

==Diet==
Studies on the diet of Humpback dolphins have mostly been restricted to individuals either stranded on shore or caught in shark nets. They feed almost exclusively on fish, although they have been known to occasionally prey on cephalopods as well. These dolphins mainly eat fish that live near reefs, in estuaries, and on the ocean floor. A study from 1983 examining the stomachs of 17 humpback dolphins found that glassnosed anchovy (&quot;Thryssa vitrirostris&quot;) was the most common prey, followed by ribbon fish (&quot;Trichiurus lepturus&quot;), olive grunter (&quot;Pomadasys olivaceum&quot;), and longtooth kob (&quot;Otolithes ruber&quot;). A study of Humpback dolphins stranded in Hong Kong from 1994-2000 had similar results, with the addition of cutlassfishes, sardines, mullets, and catfish. The presence of catfish as prey is notable due to their venomous spines, which have been implicated in the deaths of dolphins elsewhere. A more recent study in 2013 analyzing the stomach contents of 22 humpback dolphins (13 males, 9 females) caught in shark nets in the KwaZulu-Natal Coastline identified 59 different prey species. The main prey species were similar to those found earlier, with the addition of the bearded croaker (&quot;Johnius amblycephalus&quot;). 

Humpback dolphins employ diverse feeding strategies, such as beaching themselves partially to chase after fish. Additionally, in certain areas, these dolphins are observed trailing fishing trawlers to exploit discarded or escaped fish as a feeding opportunity. Though this behavior may conserve energy and supplement their diet, it also exposes them to risk of entanglement in nets. Two dolphins suspected of being caught in trawler nets (SC96-31/05 and SC97-31/5B) were found with undigested fish and nearly full stomachs, including significant quantities of prey species like &quot;Johnius&quot; and &quot;Collichthys lucida&quot;, commonly caught by trawlers.

==Taxonomy==
* Genus &quot;Sousa&quot;:
** &quot;S. chinensis&quot; (Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin)
** &quot;S. plumbea&quot; (Indian Ocean humpback dolphin)
** &quot;S. teuszii&quot; (Atlantic humpback dolphin)
** &quot;S. sahulensis&quot; (Australian humpback dolphin)

By the mid-2000s, most authorities accepted just two species—the Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific. However, in his widely used systematic account, Rice identified three species, viewing the Indo-Pacific as two species named simply the Indian and Pacific. The dividing line between the two (sub)species is taken to be Sumatra, one of the Indonesian islands; however, intermixing is thought to be inevitable.

Further, Australian cetologist Graham Ross writes &quot;However, recent morphological studies, somewhat supported equivocally by genetic analyses, indicate that there is a single, variable species for which the name &quot;S. chinensis&quot; has priority&quot;.

Humpback dolphins found in Chinese waters are locally known as Chinese white dolphins. See that article for specific issues relating to that subspecies which corresponds to the Pacific humpback dolphin in Rice&#x27;s classification.

In late 2013, researchers from the Wildlife Conservation Society and the American Natural History museum proposed classification of the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin into three species based on morphological and genetic analysis. Their research indicates that at least four species make up the genus &quot;Sousa&quot;: the Atlantic humpback dolphin (&quot;S. teuszii&quot;), two species of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (&quot;S. plumbea&quot; and &quot;S. chinesis&quot;), and a fourth, new species of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin found off northern Australia, a distinction with potential to guide conservation efforts for the species.

==Conservation==
&quot;S. teuszii&quot; is listed on Appendix I and Appendix II (along with &quot;S. chinensis)&quot; of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). It is listed on Appendix I as this species has been categorized as being in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant proportion of its range and CMS Parties strive towards strictly protecting these animals, conserving or restoring the places where they live, mitigating obstacles to migration and controlling other factors that might endanger them. It is listed on Appendix II as it has an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organised by tailored agreements.
In addition, the Atlantic humpback dolphin is covered by the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia.

<doc id="422600" wikidata="Q284219" url="?curid=422600" title="Patau syndrome">
<text>Patau syndrome is a syndrome caused by a chromosomal abnormality, in which some or all of the cells of the body contain extra genetic material from chromosome 13. The extra genetic material disrupts normal development, causing multiple and complex organ defects.
This can occur either because each cell contains a full extra copy of chromosome 13 (a disorder known as trisomy 13 or trisomy D or T13), or because each cell contains an extra partial copy of the chromosome, or because there are two different lines of cells—one healthy with the correct number of chromosomes 13 and one that contains an extra copy of the chromosome—mosaic Patau syndrome. Full trisomy 13 is caused by nondisjunction of chromosomes during meiosis; the mosaic form is caused by nondisjunction during mitosis.
Like all nondisjunction conditions (such as Down syndrome and Edwards syndrome), the risk of this syndrome in the offspring increases with maternal age at pregnancy, with about 31 years being the average. Patau syndrome affects somewhere between 1 in 10,000 and 1 in 21,700 live births.

==Signs and symptoms==

Of those fetuses that do survive to gestation and birth, common abnormalities may include:
* Nervous system
** Intellectual disability and motor disorder
** Microcephaly
** Holoprosencephaly (failure of the forebrain to divide properly) and associated facial deformities such as cyclopia
** Structural eye defects, including microphthalmia, Peters&#x27; anomaly, cataract, iris or fundus (coloboma), retinal dysplasia or retinal detachment, sensory nystagmus, cortical visual loss, and optic nerve hypoplasia
** Meningomyelocele (a spinal defect)
* Musculoskeletal and cutaneous
** Polydactyly (extra digits)
** Proboscis
** Congenital trigger digits
** Low-set ears
** Prominent heel
** Deformed feet known as rocker-bottom feet
** Omphalocele (abdominal defect)
** Abnormal palm pattern
** Overlapping of fingers over thumb
** Cutis aplasia (missing portion of the skin/hair)
** Cleft palate
* Urogenital
** Abnormal genitalia
** Kidney defects
* Other
** Heart defects (ventricular septal defect) (Patent Ductus Arteriosus)
** Dextrocardia
** Single umbilical artery

==Causes==
Trisomy 13 is the cause of Patau syndrome, which means each cell in the body has three copies of chromosome 13 instead of the usual two. A small percentage of cases occur when only some of the body&#x27;s cells have an extra copy; such cases are called mosaic trisomy 13.

Patau syndrome can also occur when part of chromosome 13 becomes attached to another chromosome (translocated) before or at conception in a Robertsonian translocation. Affected people have two copies of chromosome 13, plus extra material from chromosome 13 attached to another chromosome. With a translocation, the person has a partial trisomy for chromosome 13, and often the physical signs of the syndrome differ from the typical Patau syndrome.

Most cases of Patau syndrome are not inherited but occur as random events during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm). An error in cell division called non-disjunction can result in reproductive cells with an abnormal number of chromosomes. For example, an egg or sperm cell may gain an extra copy of the chromosome. If one of these atypical reproductive cells contributes to the genetic makeup of a child, the child will have an extra chromosome 13 in each of the body&#x27;s cells. Mosaic Patau syndrome is also not inherited. It occurs as a random error during cell division early in fetal development.

Patau syndrome due to a translocation can be inherited. An unaffected person can carry a rearrangement of genetic material between chromosome 13 and another chromosome. This rearrangement is called a balanced translocation because there is no extra material from chromosome 13. Although they do not have signs of Patau syndrome, people who carry this type of balanced translocation are at an increased risk of having children with the condition.

===Recurrence risk===
Unless one of the parents is a carrier of a translocation, the chances of a couple having another trisomy 13 affected child is less than 1%, below that of Down syndrome.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is usually based on clinical findings, although fetal chromosome testing will show trisomy 13. While many of the physical findings are similar to Edwards syndrome, there are a few unique traits, such as polydactyly. However, unlike Edwards syndrome and Down syndrome, the quad screen does not provide a reliable means of screening for this disorder. This is due to the variability of the results seen in fetuses with Patau.

==Treatment==
Medical management of children with Trisomy 13 is planned on a case-by-case basis and depends on the individual circumstances of the patient. Treatment of Patau syndrome focuses on the particular physical problems with which each child is born. Many infants have difficulty surviving the first few days or weeks due to severe neurological problems or complex heart defects. Surgery may be necessary to repair heart defects or cleft lip and cleft palate. Physical, occupational, and speech therapy will help individuals with Patau syndrome reach their full developmental potential. Surviving children are described as happy and parents report that they enrich their lives.

==Prognosis==
Approximately 90% of infants with Patau syndrome die within the first year of life. Those children who do survive past 1 year of life are typically severely disabled with intellectual disability, seizures, and psychomotor issues. Children with the mosaic variation are usually affected to a lesser extent. In a retrospective Canadian study of 174 children with trisomy 13, median survival time was 12.5 days. One and ten-year survival were 19.8% and 12.9%, respectively, including those who underwent aggressive surgical intervention.

==History==
Trisomy 13 was first described by Thomas Bartholin in 1657, but the chromosomal nature of the disease was ascertained by Dr. Klaus Patau and Dr. Eeva Therman in 1960. The disease is named in Patau&#x27;s honor.

In England and Wales during 2008–09, there were 172 diagnoses of Patau syndrome (trisomy 13), with 91% of diagnoses made prenatally. There were 111 elective abortions, 14 stillbirth/miscarriage/fetal deaths, 30 outcomes unknown, and 17 live births. Approximately 4% of Patau syndrome with unknown outcomes are likely to result in a live birth, therefore the total number of live births is estimated to be 18.

<text>German attempts at the colonization of the Americas consisted of German Venezuela (, also ), St. Thomas and Crab Island in the 16th and 17th centuries.

==History==

===Klein-Venedig===

&quot;Klein-Venedig&quot; (&quot;Little Venice&quot;; also the etymology of the name &quot;Venezuela&quot;) was the most significant part of the German colonization of the Americas between 1528 and 1546. The Augsburg-based Welser banking family (bankers to the Habsburgs) was given the colonial rights to the land by Emperor Charles V, who owed them debts for his imperial election as Holy Roman Emperor. In 1528, Charles V issued a charter by which the Welsers possessed the rights to explore, rule and colonize the area with the primary motivation of searching for the legendary golden city of El Dorado. The venture was initially led by Ambrosius Ehinger, who founded Maracaibo in 1529. After the deaths of first Ehinger (1533), Nikolaus Federmann, Georg von Speyer (1540), Philipp von Hutten continued exploration in the interior. In absence of von Hutten from the capital of the province the crown of Spain claimed the right to appoint the governor. The Spanish Juan de Carvajal was nominated governor by the Emperor Charles V and tried to take control of the province. In 1545 he founded El Tocuyo with German colonists of Coro. On Hutten&#x27;s return to the capital, Santa Ana de Coro, in 1546, the governor Carvajal had Hutten and Bartholomeus VI. Welser executed. Subsequently, Charles V revoked Welser&#x27;s charter.

The Welsers transported German miners to the colony, as well as 4,000 African slaves as labour to work sugar cane plantations. Many of the German colonists died from tropical diseases, to which they had no immunity, or during frequent wars with Native Americans.

===Brandenburg-Prussia===
The &quot;Brandenburgisch-Africanische Compagnie&quot; of Brandenburg (the future Kingdom of Prussia) established trading posts in Africa and leased a trading post on St. Thomas from the Danish West India-Guinea Company in 1685. In 1693, the Danes seized the post, its warehouse, and all its goods without warning or repayment. There were no permanent German settlers.
===Duchy of Courland===
The Duchy of Courland, a German-led vassal state of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, leased New Courland (&quot;Neu-Kurland&quot;) on Tobago in the Caribbean from the British. The colony failed and was restored several times. A final Courish attempt to establish a Caribbean colony involved a settlement near modern Toco on Trinidad.

===County of Hanau===

The counties of Hanau-Lichtenberg and Hanau-Münzenberg, under Frederick Casimir and his adviser Johann Becher, funded but did not complete an extravagant program to lease Guiana from the Dutch West India Company. Calling his new realm the Hanauish-Indies (&quot;Hanauisch-Indien&quot;), Frederick Casimir ran up huge debts that ultimately forced him into a regency by some of his relatives.

<doc id="422606" wikidata="Q1468473" url="?curid=422606" title="Jack Black (rat catcher)">
<text>Jack Black was a rat-catcher and mole destroyer from Battersea, England during the middle of the 19th century. At the time, England was ravaged by a massive population of rats that disrupted crops and spread disease, and Black&#x27;s rat killing abilities made him a minor celebrity and Queen Victoria&#x27;s official rat-catcher. Though he has been called the rat&#x27;s &quot;most notorious enemy,&quot; he did not kill all rats. Black bred unusually colored rats and sold them as pets, playing a large role in domesticating the animal. He had a flamboyant appearance, typically donning a self-made &quot;uniform&quot; of a green topcoat, scarlet waistcoat, and breeches, with a huge leather sash inset with cast-iron rats.

==Biography==

As a young boy, Jack Black grabbed feral rats in Regent’s Park and flung them in wire cages, which impressed passersby. He behaved like a showman, entertaining onlookers by training rats to live in his shirt and crawl up and down his arms. Black said the rat work came naturally to him. He earned him various jobs catching rats on private property, and he also supplied live rats to pubs for rat-baiting contests, popular mid-Victorian activity of placing bets on the number of rats a dog could kill.

Jack Black&#x27;s eye-catching outfit caught the attention of Henry Mayhew, who wrote about Black in &quot;London Labour and the London Poor.&quot; Black told Mayhew about his vicious, nearly-fatal battles against England&#x27;s rats: &quot;I’ve been bitten nearly everywhere, even where I can’t name to you,&quot; he said. He also revealed that he tasted rat flesh &quot;unbeknown to his wife,&quot; describing it as &quot;moist as rabbits, and quite as nice.&quot;

Black enlisted various animals to help him massacre rats. One tactic was to train ferrets to sniff out rats and then unleash the dogs on the ferrets. Other hunting animals Black used included a monkey which he said &quot;didn’t do much&quot;, a badger named Polly, and raccoons. In addition to rat-killing, Black was involved in fishing, bird catching, taxidermy, and was particularly accomplished in dog breeding. He told Mayhew that his black tan terrier Billy, a rat-killing dog, was &quot;the greatest stock dog in London&quot; and had fathered &quot;the greatest portion of the small black tan dogs&quot; in the city, making the dog &quot;known to all the London fancy&quot;. He said he sold a similar dog to the Austrian Ambassador for fourteen pounds.

When Jack Black caught unusually coloured rats, he bred them to establish new colour varieties. He decorated his home-bred domesticated rats with ribbons and sold them as pets, mainly &quot;to well-bred young ladies to keep in squirrel cages&quot;, he said. Beatrix Potter is believed to have been one of his customers, and she dedicated the book &quot;Samuel Whiskers&quot; to her rat of the same name. The more sophisticated ladies of court kept their rats in dainty gilded cages, and even Queen Victoria herself kept rats. It was in this way that domesticated or fancy rats were established.

==Establishment of fancy rats==
Jack Black&#x27;s sales of rats as pets during the 1840s and 1860s played a role in the rat&#x27;s domestication and widespread acceptance as a pet. He bred many different colours of the rats, which became known as fancy rats. By 1869, Charles Baudelaire called the rat &quot;the poor child’s toy&quot; in his poetry collection &quot;Le Spleen de Paris.&quot; By 1901, rats were so popular as pets that Mary Douglas received permission from England&#x27;s National Mouse Club to bring her pet rats to an exhibition at the Aylesbury Town Show on 24 October 1901. Her black and white hooded &quot;Rattus norvegicus&quot; won &quot;Best in Show,&quot; and the Rat Fancy was formally launched.

The original Rat Fancy lasted until 1931, as part of the National Mouse and Rat Club. The modern Rat Fancy was revived in 1976 with the formation of the National Fancy Rat Society, and the fancy rat spread around the world. Nowadays, fancy rats are widely accepted as pets and exhibition animals.

<text>Proisocortex or pro-isocortex is one of two subtypes of cortical areas in the areas belonging to the neocortex. The other subtype is termed the true isocortex. Proisocortical areas are transitional areas placed between areas of true isocortex and areas of periallocortex (which themselves are transitional between &quot;true&quot; allocortex and proisocortex). The histological structure of proisocortex is also transitional between true isocortex and either peripaleocortex or periarchicortex, depending on with which subtype of periallocortex the given proisocortical area borders.

Proisocortex is found in the cingulate cortex (part of the limbic system), in Brodmann&#x27;s areas 24, 25, 30 and 32, the insula and parahippocampal gyrus.

The transitional cortical areas from isocortical side (i.e. proisocortex) and from allocortical side (i.e. periarchicortex and peripaleocortex) together are called mesocortex. The mesocortex is essentially the same as paralimbic cortex, as all mesocortical transitional areas are found exclusively in paralimbic region, and vice versa - all the paralimbic cortex is mesocortical in its nature (embryonic and phylogenetic origins) and in its histology. But the term &quot;mesocortex&quot; represents a different concept from the term &quot;paralimbic cortex&quot;. The mesocortex is distinguished from other cortical areas based on cytoarchitectonics and histology, while the paralimbic cortex is an anatomical designation, meaning cortical areas near subcortical limbic structures.

<text>Scout Key is an island in the lower Florida Keys. It was previously known as West Summerland Key until 2010. U.S. 1 (the Overseas Highway) crosses the key at approximately mile markers 34–35, between Spanish Harbor Key and Big Pine Key.

==Etymology==

The Key was renamed to reflect the two adjoining scout camps on it, Boy Scout Camp Sawyer and Girl Scout Camp Wesumkee. The name change also removed some confusion about its location – despite its name, the formerly-named West Summerland Key is actually about 10 miles &quot;east&quot; of Summerland Key.

==Geography==
Originally, there were three keys at this location. They were connected by fills at the time the Overseas Railroad was built. The keys were West Summerland Key (westernmost), Middle Summerland Key (center), and no name is known for the easternmost key. West Summerland retained its name, but the other two are known simply as the Spanish Harbor Keys; named for the anchorage located between this key and Big Pine Key. Interesting features of this key include indian mounds, and storage buildings still standing from the Flagler railway construction era.

==Environment==
In 2017, Category 4 Hurricane Irma destroyed much of the fragile mangroves and dunes on the key, reshaping the Atlantic shoreline. A few buildings were crushed and other damaged in both Scout camps. The swimming platform at the Sawyer camp had to be rebuilt yet again after the most recent rebuilds in 2004 and 2005.

==Attractions==
Camp Wesumkee is the site of the Winter Star Party, an annual gathering of amateur astronomers.
The eastern end of the key has a small parking area on the Atlantic that allows access to the old Bahia Honda Rail Bridge, which is a popular photography spot among tourists and locals also known as &quot;Broken Bridge&quot;.

<doc id="422611" wikidata="Q1192406" url="?curid=422611" title="Atlantic humpback dolphin">
<text>The Atlantic humpback dolphin (Sousa teuszii) is a species of humpback dolphin that is found in coastal areas of West Africa.

It is regarded as critically endangered by the IUCN.

==Description==
Apart from its geographical range, it can be distinguishable from the Indo-Pacific humpback because of their distinct skin coloration and other morphological characteristics. Atlantic humpbacks have a gray or white color, unlike the Indo-Pacific humpbacks which have pink mottling. Males, in particular, can have distinct humps under their dorsal fins. They can also be distinguished by a robust body with a well-defined rostrum. They are typically slate gray on the back and sides, fading to light gray ventrally. The dorsal fin is small, slightly falcate, and triangular, and sits on a distinctive and well developed dorsal hump.

Atlantic humpbacks can also be distinguishable from the other species (&quot;S. plumbea, S. chinensis, S. sahulensis&quot; sp. nov., etc.) because of a significantly lower amount of teeth. On average, they have about 30 teeth per row versus other species having around 33–37. To compliment this, they typically have a shorter and wider skull than the other species.

At birth, this species is in weight and long. A fully grown male can weigh up to and is around long.

== Range and habitat==
This species is native to the tropical to subtropical west coast of Africa in the southeastern Atlantic Ocean, from western Sahara to Angola. The species is not commonly observed and is found sporadically across these waters. It is mainly found in shallow coastal and estuarine waters in the marine Neritic zone, usually less than deep.

== Behavior and diet ==
This species is known to be shy; it does not bow-ride and aerial displays are rarely seen. They occasionally leap, spy-hop, and tail-slap the water. Atlantic humpback dolphins prefer to keep a distance from boat engines, and when they are seen in the water, they are most likely traveling and foraging. They forage both independently and cooperatively. The groups usually range from 1-8 animals, but gatherings of up to 20-40 animals have been observed. An average swim speed during travel has been measured at about . In Angola and Guinea, some individuals appear to exhibit high site fidelity and strong association patterns. Atlantic humpback dolphins communicate similarly to other dolphin species via echolocation.

Groups generally forage close to shore in shallow waters and often within the surf zone. They appear to feed mainly on inshore schooling fish such as mullet, though a variety of coastal fish and crustacean species are also known as their prey items. Their specific prey species depends on what geographic location they occupy and what is available. These dolphins tend to feed in small bays, sheltered waters behind reef-breaks and in areas off dry river mouths, while traveling occurs mainly along exposed coastlines.

==Interaction with humans==
The Atlantic humpback dolphin is known to engage in cooperative fishing with Mauritanian Imraguen fishermen, by driving fish towards the shore and into their nets. Incidental capture in gill nets is considered their greatest threat followed by directed takes, habitat loss and degradation, overfishing, marine pollution, anthropogenic sound, and climate change.

== Threats ==

Habitat loss and degradation are the measured causes of declines in the Atlantic humpback dolphin population. Humans are continuously expanding coastal communities and polluting the oceans, which cause a threat to marine life. Overfishing reduces the number of prey available to the dolphins, which leads to an inadequate amount of diet available to them. They are vulnerable to marine pollution (oil spills, untreated sewage, run-off from agricultural areas, etc.) and subsequent marine bacterial bloom, which causes harm to coastal cetaceans. Toxins from the bacteria in the water can easily wipe out a critically endangered species, like the Atlantic Humpback dolphin. Anthropogenic sound includes the hearing loss and ear tissue damage of the dolphins from noisy coastal development and shipping. The geographic location of Atlantic humpbacks depend on the water temperature and prey distribution. Climate change causes the fluctuation of water temperatures, which forces the dolphins to adapt to environmental changes.

== Conservation ==
The current conservation status of the Atlantic Humpback is critically endangered, according to the IUCN. This is because of the dolphin&#x27;s restricted range, specific habitat, low population size, and continued human threats. Coastal development with the associated disturbance in Africa is inevitable and will continue to harm the shy species, whether it is directly or indirectly. The dolphins have already been challenged by climate change and have evolved adequate adaptations because of the impact of human activities. It does not live in the cold, deep waters in the ocean because of the rise in world temperature. The only place left for these dolphins to live is the shallow, warm waters in the ocean. If the world temperature continues to rise, there will be no habitat for the dolphins to successfully thrive and reproduce.

Properly enforced state laws about bycatch and marine protected areas are one solution in conserving the dolphins. Enforcing such a law that states fishing nets cannot be cast a certain distance from the shore will ensure dolphin survival because there would be less incidental dolphin captures. Educating the community to be aware of the threats they are making to the dolphins via public awareness campaigns or training will improve their knowledge on marine life conservation.

Scientific researchers are finding more information about Atlantic Humpbacks and are currently investigating how human activities can decrease the impact on the species.

<doc id="422616" wikidata="Q3017051" url="?curid=422616" title="Indian Ocean humpback dolphin">
<text>The Indian Ocean humpback dolphin (Sousa plumbea) is a member of the Delphinidae family occupying coastal areas ranging from Southern Africa to Western Indochina. The Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (&quot;Sousa chinensis&quot;) was formerly included within the same species, but a 2014 study revealed them to be a separate species.

The most limiting factor to habitat-usage is water depth, with most specimens remaining in waters shallower than 20 meters. As a result, the Indian Ocean humpback dolphin&#x27;s offshore range is largely dependent on the coastlines&#x27; specific physiographical characteristics. The species has been reported to inhabit nearly every type of coastal habitat, although preference and prominence of any given habitat type is highly dependent on the geographical location. Indian Ocean humpback dolphins experience extremely high rates of calf and juvenile mortality due to anthropogenic disturbances such as environmental pollution, habitat deterioration and noise pollution.

Indian Ocean humpback dolphins are social delphinids that live in groups averaging twelve individuals, although group size can be highly variable. The majority of their diet is composed of sciaenid fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans.

The species is currently categorized as Endangered.

==Distribution and habitat==
=== Distribution ===
&quot;Sousa plumbea&quot; ranges from Southern Africa to Western Indochina, including coastal areas along East Africa, the Middle East and India. There is studied population in Menai Bay Conservation Area of Tanzania&#x27;s Zanzibar Archipelago. Critically important populations have been determined in Southeast Asia, particularly along the southern coastlines of China. Recent investigations have, however, similarly determined critical populations along the coasts of the Arabian peninsula, particularly including the Sultanate of Oman and the United Arab Emirates.

While &quot;S. plumbea&quot; and &quot;S. chinensis&quot; are genetically distinguishable, delphinids&#x27; high capacity for hybridization have resulted in hybrid populations in areas of overlapping distribution. In fact, genetic analysis has indicated that &quot;S. chinensis&quot; sampled from Indochina are more closely related to &quot;S. plumbea&quot; than to &quot;S. chinensis&quot; from Australia.

This species does not exhibit large migratory behavior.

==Description==

The Indian Ocean humpback dolphin is a medium-sized dolphin that ranges in length from and in weight from . They have a fatty hump on the back, which differentiates them from &quot;S. chinensis&quot; which have a more prominent dorsal fin, but no hump.

Different varieties have different coloration, although young dolphins are generally gray, with darker gray above than below. They are generally dark gray.

Indian Ocean humpback dolphins can appear similar to conspecific Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins, but the bottlenose dolphins lack the hump. All humpback dolphins have a distinctive motion when surfacing, in that it surfaces at a 30- to 45-degree angle with the rostrum, and sometimes the full head, showing before arching its back and sometimes showing its flukes.

==Life history==

== Sociality ==
The Indian Ocean humpback dolphin is a social delphinid that typically lives within a group. Group size is, however, highly variable. Some specimens have been found to be isolated individuals, although the average group is composed of around 12 individuals and some of the largest observed groups have been in excess of 100 individuals.

There is very little scientific evidence to support significant inter-species interactions and groupings, although rare observations have noted interactions (both friendly and aggressive) with the sympatric Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin, snubfin dolphin, long-snouted spinner dolphin and finless porpoise.

==Conservation==
The Indian Ocean humpback dolphin has proven to be particularly susceptible to the deleterious effects of anthropogenic activity. The species&#x27; shallow, coastal habitat heightens their exposure to anthropogenic disturbances such as habitat deterioration, mortality due to by-catch, vessel striking, and noise pollution. The most driving factor appears to be chemical pollution, as tissue analysis of many stranded specimens exhibit fatal concentrations of organochlorines. As a result, a number of nations have preemptively established conservation and management programs to ensure that the species&#x27; does not become endangered.

Recent investigative studies have revealed that the United Arab Emirates houses one of the world&#x27;s largest populations.

<text>The University of Roehampton, London, formerly Roehampton Institute of Higher Education, is a public university in the United Kingdom, situated on three major sites in Roehampton, in the London Borough of Wandsworth. The University traces its roots to four institutions founded in the 19th century, which today make up the university&#x27;s constituent colleges, around which student accommodation is centred: Digby Stuart College, Froebel College, Southlands College and Whitelands College. 

Between 2000 and 2004, Roehampton, together with the University of Surrey, partnered as the Federal University of Surrey. In 2004, Roehampton became an independent university, and in 2011, it was renamed the University of Roehampton. The university is one of the post-1992 universities. Roehampton is a member of the European University Association and Universities UK.

Roehampton&#x27;s academic faculties include the Faculty of Business and Law, Faculty of Arts, Faculty of Education, Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, Faculty of Life and Health Sciences and Faculty of Psychology. 

The University achieved a Silver rating in the 2023 Teaching Excellence Framework and boasts high rankings in student satisfaction and research.

==History==

Roehampton operates through a collegiate system, with four historic colleges that aim to provide a supportive community structure for students. The four colleges we founded in the 19th century as women&#x27;s teacher training colleges:

* Whitelands College – Founded in 1841, the college is one of the five oldest institutions for training educators in England. A flagship women&#x27;s college of the Church of England, it was the first college of higher education in the UK to admit women. It occupies a 14-acre site overlooking Richmond Park.
* Southlands College – Established in by the Methodist Church in 1872, originally in Battersea, as a teacher training college for women, becoming coeducational in 1965. Today it is the location of the University&#x27;s Business School.
* Digby Stuart College – Established in 1874 as a teacher training college for Roman Catholic women. The college owes its existence to the Society of the Sacred Heart, whose members continue to support the college and the university.
* Froebel College – Founded in 1892, the secular college (non religious) was established to further the values of Friedrich Fröbel, the German educationalist who pioneered a holistic view of child development. It is one of the UK&#x27;s major centres for initial teacher training

All four colleges were founded to address the need to educate poor and disadvantaged children. In 1976, the four colleges joined to form the Roehampton Institute of Higher Education. Its first Rector was Kevin Keohane, the former Professor of Science Education at Chelsea College of Science and Technology.

Since 2011, the university has been branded the University of Roehampton. However, its legal name remains Roehampton University. In 2012 the last college, Whitelands, was legally merged with the university, bringing all the colleges into a common management structure.

In the 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF), the university was already ranked as the most research-intensive post-1992 university in the UK. Roehampton submitted work by more than two-thirds of its academic staff, in 13 subject areas. This is the highest proportion of any post-1992 university. Dance was the top performing subject, with 94% of research rated 4* and 3* – making it the highest-rated department in its subject area in the UK. Roehampton was also ranked 3rd in London for research quality in Education, and 4th for English. Roehampton was the strongest-performing university in London in these subject areas. Overall, 66 per cent Roehampton&#x27;s research was judged either world-leading or internationally excellent.

In the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise (RAE), Roehampton University was ranked first in the country for Dance and Biological Anthropology. Ten out of the fifteen subjects that submitted work included at least some proportion of research judged to be world-leading in terms of its originality and significance. 78% of all research undertaken at the university was of an international standard.

<text>Peleș Castle ( ) is a Neo-Renaissance palace in the Royal Domain of Sinaia in the Carpathian Mountains, near Sinaia, in Prahova County, Romania, on an existing medieval route linking Transylvania and Wallachia, built between 1873 and 1914. Its inauguration was held in 1883. It was constructed for King Carol I of Romania.

==Location==
The complex is northwest of the town of Sinaia, which is from Brașov and from Bucharest. In the southeastern Carpathian Mountains, the complex is composed of three monuments: Peleș Castle, Pelișor Castle, and the Foișor Hunting Lodge.

==History==

When King Carol I of Romania (1839–1914), under whose reign the country gained its independence, first visited the site of the future castle in 1866, he fell in love with the magnificent mountain scenery. In 1872, the Crown purchased of land near the Piatra Arsă River. The estate was named the Royal Estate of Sinaia. The King commissioned the construction of a royal hunting preserve and summer retreat on the property, and the foundation was laid for Peleș Castle on 22 August 1873. Several auxiliary buildings were built simultaneously with the castle: the guards&#x27; chambers, the Economat Building, the Foișor hunting lodge, the royal stables, and a power plant. Peleș became the world&#x27;s first castle fully powered by locally produced electricity.

The first three design plans submitted for Peleș were copies of other palaces in Western Europe, and King Carol I rejected them all as lacking originality and being too costly. German architect Johannes Schultz won the project by presenting a more original plan, something that appealed to the King&#x27;s taste: a grand palatial alpine castle combining different features of classic European styles, mostly following Italian elegance and German aesthetics along Renaissance lines. Works were also led by architect Carol Benesch. Later additions were made between 1893 and 1914 by the Czech architect Karel Liman, who designed the towers, including the main central tower, which is in height. The Sipot Building, which served as Liman&#x27;s headquarters during the construction, was built later on. Liman would supervise the building of the nearby Pelișor Castle (1889–1903, the future residence of King Ferdinand I and Queen Marie of Romania), as well as of King Ferdinand&#x27;s villa in the Royal Sheepfold Meadow. King Carol I and Queen Elizabeth lived in Foişor Villa during construction, as King Ferdinand and Queen Marie had during the construction of Pelișor Castle. 

The cost of the work on the castle undertaken between 1875 and 1914 was estimated to be 16,000,000 Romanian lei in gold. Between three and four hundred men worked on the construction. During the construction phase, Queen Elisabeth of Wied wrote in her journal:

Construction slowed during the Romanian War of Independence against the Ottoman Empire in 1877–1878, but soon afterwards the plans grew in size and construction was quite rapid. In the 1883 inaugural journey of the Orient Express to Bucharest, passengers from Paris were invited to Peleș Castle by Queen Elisabeth of Wied as King Carol I ceremoniously put the last brick in place to celebrate the castle&#x27;s completion. This initiative by Queen Elisabeth was part of an effort to promote Peleș Castle and Romania&#x27;s Carpathians to a broader audience. Peleș Castle had its official Royal Ball of Inauguration on 7 October 1883. Thereafter, Carol II of Romania was born at the castle in 1893, giving meaning to the phrase &quot;cradle of the dynasty, cradle of the nation&quot; that Carol I bestowed upon Peleș Castle. Carol II lived in Foișor Villa for periods during his reign. Princess Maria died there in 1874. 

After the forced abdication of King Michael I of Romania in 1947, Communist Romania seized all royal property, including the Peleș Estate. The castle was opened as a tourist attraction for a short time. It also served as a recreation and resting place for Romanian cultural personalities. The castle was declared a museum in 1953. Nicolae Ceaușescu closed the entire estate between 1975 and 1990, during the last years of the Communist regime. The area was declared a &quot;State Protocol Interest Area&quot;, and the only persons permitted on the property were maintenance and military personnel.
Ceaușescu did not like the castle very much and rarely visited. In the 1980s, some of the timber was infested with &quot;Serpula lacrymans&quot;. After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, Peleș and Pelișor Castle were re-established as heritage sites and opened to the public. Today, Foișor Castle serves as a presidential residence. The Economat Building and the Guard&#x27;s Chambers Building are now hotels and restaurants. Some of the other buildings on the Peleș Estate were converted to tourist villas and some are now &quot;state protocol buildings&quot;. In 2006, the Romanian government announced the restitution of the Royal Domain including all properties and land within the domain to the former monarch, King Michael I. Negotiations soon began between the king and the government of Romania, and were concluded in 2007. The castle is on lease from the royal family to the Romanian state. Peleș Castle receives between a quarter and almost a half million visitors annually.

Throughout its history, the castle hosted some important personalities, from royalty and politicians to artists. One of the most memorable visits was that of Kaiser Franz Joseph I of Austria-Hungary on 2 October 1896, who later wrote in a letter:

Artists like George Enescu, Sarah Bernhardt, Jacques Thibaud and Vasile Alecsandri visited often as guests of Queen Elizabeth of Romania (herself a writer also known under the pen name of Carmen Sylva). In more recent times, many foreign dignitaries such as Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Muammar al-Gaddafi, and Yasser Arafat were welcomed at the castle.

The castle was featured in the 2009 film &quot;The Brothers Bloom&quot;. The exterior of the castle is used to represent a large estate in New Jersey, the home of an eccentric billionaire played by Rachel Weisz.

The castle was featured in the Netflix original film &quot;A Christmas Prince&quot; and its two sequels, &quot;A Christmas Prince: The Royal Wedding&quot; and &quot;A Christmas Prince: The Royal Baby&quot;. It was also featured in the Hallmark Channel movie &quot;A Princess for Christmas&quot; (2011) and &quot;Royal Matchmaker&quot; (2018).

==Description==
By form and function, Peleș is a palace, but it is consistently called a castle. Its architectural style is a romantically inspired blend Neo-Renaissance and Gothic Revival similar to Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria. A Saxon influence can be observed in the interior courtyard facades, which have allegorical hand-painted murals and ornate fachwerk similar to that seen in northern European alpine architecture. Interior decoration is mostly Baroque influenced, with heavy carved woods and exquisite fabrics.

Peleș Castle has a floor plan with over 170 rooms, many with dedicated themes from world cultures (in a similar fashion as other Romanian palaces, such as Cotroceni Palace). Themes vary by function (offices, libraries, armouries, art galleries) or by style (Florentine, Turkish, Moorish, French, Imperial); all the rooms are lavishly furnished and decorated to the slightest detail. There are 30 bathrooms. The establishment has collections of statues, paintings, furniture, arms and armor, gold, silver, stained glass, ivory, porcelain, tapestries and rugs. The collection of arms and armour has over 4,000 pieces, divided between Eastern and Western war pieces and ceremonial or hunting pieces, spreading over four centuries of history. Oriental rugs come from many sources: Bukhara, Mosul, Isparta, Saruk and Smyrna. The porcelain is from Sèvres and Meissen; the leather is from Córdoba. The hand-painted stained glass vitralios, which are mostly Swiss.

A towering statue of King Carol I by Raffaello Romanelli overlooks the main entrance. Many other statues are present on the seven Italian neo-Renaissance terrace gardens, mostly of Carrara marble executed by the Italian sculptor Romanelli. The gardens also host fountains, urns, stairways, guarding lions, marble paths and other decorative pieces.

Peleș Castle shelters a painting collection of almost 2,000 pieces. Angelo de Gubernatis (1840–1913) was an Italian writer who arrived in 1898 in Sinaia as a guest of the royal family:

==Museum==

Public visits are made within guided tours. One of the tours is limited to the ground floor, another adds the first floor and the complete tour includes the second floor. Admission is charged, and there is an additional photography fee. The visiting hours are from 9 am to 5 pm; Wednesday through Sunday. On Tuesdays, the hours are 11 am to 5 pm. The castle is closed on Mondays. These visiting hours are subject to change by the Romanian Culture Ministry. The castle is closed in November each year for maintenance and cleaning.

The most notable grand rooms are:

Holul de Onoare (The Hall of Honour) was finished completely only in 1911, under the guidance of Karel Liman. It spreads over three floors. Walls are dressed in exquisitely carved woodwork, mostly European walnut and exotic timbers. Bas-reliefs, alabaster sculptures, and retractable stained glass panels complete the decor.

Apartamentul Imperial (The Imperial Suite) is believed to be a tribute to the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I, who visited the palace as a friend of the Romanian royal family. Hence, decorator Auguste Bembe preferred the sumptuous Austrian Baroque in style of Empress Maria Theresa. A perfectly preserved five-hundred-year-old Cordoban tooled leather wall cover is the rarest of such quality.

Sala Mare de Arme (The Grand Armory or The Arsenal) is where 1,600 of the 4,000 pieces of weaponry and armor reside. One of Europe&#x27;s finest collection of hunting and war implements, timelined between 14th and 19th century, are on display. The king added pieces used in his victory against the Ottoman Turks during the War of Independence. Famous are the complete Maximilian armor for horse and rider and a 15th-century German &quot;nobles only&quot; decapitation broadsword. Also on display are a wide array of polearms (glaives, halberds, lances, hunting spears), firearms (muskets, blunderbusses, snaphaunces, flintlocks, pistols), axes, crossbows, and swords (rapiers, sabers, broadswords, and many others).

Sala Mică de Arme (The Small Armory) is where predominantly Oriental (mostly Indo-Persian, Ottoman and Arab) arms and armor pieces are on exhibit, many of them made of gold and silver, and inlaid with precious stones. Included are chainmail armor, helmets, scimitars, yataghans, daggers, matchlocks, lances, pistols, shields, axes, and spears.

Sala de Teatru (The Playhouse) is decorated in Louis XIV style, with sixty seats and a Royal Box. Architectural decoration and mural paintings are signed by Gustav Klimt and Frantz Matsch.

Sala Florentină (The Florentine Room) combines revived elements of the Italian Renaissance, mostly from Florence. Most impressive are the solid bronze doors executed in Rome; ateliers of Luigi Magni; and the Grand Marble Fireplace executed by Paunazio with Michelangelo motifs.

Salonul Maur (The Moorish Salon) was executed under the guidance of Charles Lecompte de Nouy, and is meant to embody elements of North-African and Hispanic Moorish style. Mother-of-pearl inlaid furniture, fine Persian Sarouk and Ottoman Isparta rugs, and Oriental weapons and armor are perhaps the most expressive elements. The salon has an indoor marble fountain.

Salonul Turcesc (The Turkish Parlor) emulates an Ottoman &quot;joie de vivre&quot; atmosphere—a room full of Turkish İzmir rugs and copperware from Anatolia and Persia. It was used as a smoking room for gentlemen. Walls are covered in hand-made textiles like silk brocades from the Siegert shops of Vienna.

In something remarkable in comparison to most recent-era royal families, the monarchs shared a bedroom.

==Present day==

Originally personal property of the royal family, Peleș Castle was nationalized when King Michael I was forced to abdicate and into exile by the Socialist Republic of Romania in 1947. In 1997, the castle was returned to the royal family in a long judicial case that was finally concluded in 2007. Michael I subsequently said the castle should continue to house the Peleș National Museum, as well as being occasionally used for public royal ceremonies.

Michael I&#x27;s heir Margareta, Custodian of the Romanian Crown occasionally uses the castle for receptions, investitures and other public events. On 10 May (Monarchy Day) 2016, the royal family hosted a large reception, garden party and concert at Peleș Castle to mark the 150th anniversary of the Romanian Royal Dynasty, where Margareta&#x27;s standard was flown from Peleș Castle—the first time since 1947 that a royal standard had flown from the castle.

In August 2016, the body of Queen Anne Lay in State in the Hall of Honour at Peleș Castle in a ceremony attended by the presidents of Romania and Moldova, as well as Prime Minister Dacian Cioloș and other national leaders. This was followed on 13 December 2017 by King Michael I Lying in State in the same location in a similar, but larger, ceremony prior to his state funeral in Bucharest and burial in Curtea de Argeș Cathedral.

<text>Paul Mackintosh Foot (8 November 1937 – 18 July 2004) was a British investigative journalist, political campaigner, author, and long-time member of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP).

==Early life and education==
Foot was born in Haifa during the British mandate.

He was the son of Sir Hugh Foot (who was the last Governor of Cyprus and Jamaica and, as Lord Caradon, the Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom to the United Nations from 1964 to 1970) and the grandson of Isaac Foot, who had been a Liberal MP. He was a nephew of Michael Foot, later leader of the Labour Party, with whom the younger Foot was close. He spent his youth at his uncle&#x27;s house in Devon, in Italy with his grandmother and with his parents (who lived abroad) in Cyprus and Jamaica.

He was sent to what he described as &quot;a ludicrously snobbish preparatory school (Ludgrove) and an only slightly less absurd public school, Shrewsbury&quot;. Contemporaries at Shrewsbury included Richard Ingrams, Willie Rushton, Christopher Booker, and several other friends with whom he later become involved in &quot;Private Eye&quot;.

Anthony Chenevix-Trench, later the Headmaster of Eton College, was Foot&#x27;s Housemaster at Shrewsbury School between 1952 and 1955, a time when corporal punishment in all schools was commonplace. In adult life, Foot exposed the ritual beatings that Chenevix-Trench had given. Nick Cohen wrote in Foot&#x27;s obituary in &quot;The Observer&quot;:&quot;Even by the standards of England&#x27;s public schools, Anthony Chenevix-Trench, his housemaster at Shrewsbury, was a flagellomaniac. Foot recalled, &#x27;He would offer his culprit an alternative: four strokes with the cane, which hurt; or six with the strap, with trousers down, which didn&#x27;t. Sensible boys always chose the strap, despite the humiliation, and Trench, quite unable to control his glee, led the way to an upstairs room, which he locked, before hauling down the miscreant&#x27;s trousers, lying him face down on a couch and lashing out with a belt.&quot; Foot first detailed Chenevix-Trench&#x27;s behaviour for &quot;Private Eye&quot; in 1969, an experience described by Cohen as one of Foot&#x27;s happiest days in journalism.

After his national service in Jamaica, Foot was reunited with Ingrams at University College at the University of Oxford, where he read jurisprudence, and wrote for &quot;Isis&quot;, one of the student publications at the university. He briefly edited &quot;Isis&quot;, resulting in the publication being temporarily banned by the university authorities after Foot began to publish articles that found fault with university lectures.

==Years in Glasgow==

Via his uncle, Paul Foot made the acquaintance of Hugh Cudlipp, the editorial director of Mirror Group Newspapers, who offered him a job with the company and Foot joined the &quot;Daily Record&quot; in Glasgow. He was expected &quot;to sort out the Trots&quot; in his journalism, but instead the experience of living in the Scottish city changed his whole outlook.

Foot met workers from shipyards and engineering firms who had joined the Young Socialists. He read, for the first time, Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, Rosa Luxemburg, Leon Trotsky, and the multi-volume biography of Trotsky by Isaac Deutscher.

While living in Glasgow he met Tony Cliff, &quot;an ebullient Palestinian Jew&quot;. Cliff argued that Russia was state capitalist and that Russian workers were cut off from economic and political power as much as, if not more than, those in the West. Persuaded by what he heard and saw, in 1963 Foot joined the International Socialists, the group in which Cliff had a leading role, and the organisational forerunner of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP).

&quot;Of all the many lessons I learnt in those three years in Glasgow,&quot; he wrote later, &quot;the one which most affected my life was a passing remark by Rosa Luxemburg. She predicted that, however strong people&#x27;s socialist commitment, as soon as they are involved even to the slightest degree in managing the system on behalf of capitalists, they will be lost to the socialist cause.&quot;

Foot covered the 1962 West Lothian by-election as a political reporter for the &quot;Daily Record&quot;. He asked of the Labour candidate, Tam Dalyell: &quot;How on earth is it that the West Lothian Constituency Labour Party with six coal-mines in the constituency can choose somebody from Eton and King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, as their candidate?&quot; H. B. Boyne, a political correspondent for the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, reminded Foot of his own background. The incident did not stop the two men becoming friends.

==Journalism and public career (1964–1978)==
In 1964, he returned to London and began to work for &quot;The Sun&quot;, as the trade union newspaper, the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, had become, in a department called Probe. The intention was to investigate and publish stories behind the news but the Probe team resigned after six months. &quot;The man in charge turned out to be a former &quot;Daily Express&quot; City editor.&quot;

Foot left to work, part-time, on the Mandrake column on &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;. He had contributed articles to &quot;Private Eye&quot; since 1964 but decided, in February 1967, to take a cut in salary and join the staff of the magazine on a full-time basis, working with its editor, Richard Ingrams and Peter Cook, by now in possession of a controlling interest in the magazine. When asked about the decision later, Foot would say he could not resist the prospect of two whole pages with complete freedom to write whatever he liked. &quot;Writing for &quot;Private Eye&quot; is the only journalism I have ever been engaged in which is pure enjoyment. It is free publishing of the most exhilarating kind.&quot;

Foot got on very well with Cook, only realising after the latter&#x27;s death in 1995 how much they had in common, &quot;We both were born in the same week, into the same sort of family. His father, like mine, was a colonial servant rushing round the world hauling down the imperial flag. Both fathers shipped their eldest sons back to public school education in England. We both spent our school holidays with popular aunts and uncles in the West Country.&quot;

Foot&#x27;s first stint at &quot;Private Eye&quot; lasted until 1972 when, according to Patrick Marnham, Foot was sacked by Ingrams, who had come to the conclusion that Foot&#x27;s copy was being unduly influenced by his contacts in the International Socialists. Ingrams has denied this, writing, &quot;It was said at the time that he and I had fallen out over political issues. In fact, we very seldom disagreed about such things, the only tension arising from Paul&#x27;s belief that whenever there was a strike he had to support the union regardless of any rights or wrongs.&quot; In October 1972, he left to join the &quot;Socialist Worker&quot;, the weekly newspaper of the International Socialists, &quot;confident that a revolution was coming&quot;, as he explained decades later. He became editor in 1974. He unsuccessfully fought the Birmingham Stechford by-election in 1977 for the SWP, winning 1 per cent of the vote.

==Career (1978–2004)==
Six years later he returned to &quot;Private Eye&quot; but was poached in 1979 by the editor of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, Mike Molloy, who offered him a weekly investigative page of his own with one condition, that he was not to make propaganda for the SWP. In 1980, Foot began to look into the case of the &quot;Bridgewater Four&quot;, who had been convicted the previous year of killing Stourbridge newspaper boy Carl Bridgewater. He repeatedly returned to this case, to the occasional consternation of his editor but believed this practice would lead to new witnesses coming forward. Foot and his colleagues looked through many thousands of pages of evidence and statements. When his book &quot;Murder at the Farm: Who killed Carl Bridgewater?&quot; was published in 1986, Stephen Sedley wrote in the &quot;London Review of Books&quot; that Foot had not managed to &quot;answer his own question&quot; but did succeed in demonstrating &quot;that if a jury had known what is now known about the case, it would not have inculpated&quot; the defendants. After nearly 20 years in prison, their convictions were overturned at the Court of Appeal in February 1997 and the three surviving men (one had died in prison) were released.

Foot stayed at the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; for 14 years, managing to survive at the paper during the years Robert Maxwell was in control from 1984. Foot wrote in 2000: &quot;Maxwell demeaned everyone who worked for him, myself included, but I was able by sheltering behind the editor to protect myself from his more monstrous excesses.&quot; He finally fell out with the new &quot;Mirror&quot; editor, David Banks, in March 1993, nearly 17 months after Maxwell&#x27;s death. Banks, he claimed, had accused him of being &quot;mad&quot; and a contemporaneous boardroom coup had introduced, according to Foot, a &quot;systematic campaign of union-busting&quot; at the company. He left the &quot;Mirror&quot; in 1993 when the paper refused to print articles critical of its new management and placed Foot on sick leave. &quot;This is Stalinist psychiatry,&quot; he said at the time. &quot;If you don&#x27;t agree with us you must be mad.&quot; Banks also revealed Foot&#x27;s salary as £55,000 at the time of the row over the unpublished column, although Foot himself said that it was actually a few thousand less.

Foot rejoined &quot;Private Eye&quot;, now with Ian Hislop as the magazine&#x27;s editor, and began his regular column for &quot;The Guardian&quot;. From 2001, he was a Socialist Alliance candidate for several offices. In the Hackney mayoral election in 2002 he came third, beating the Liberal Democrat candidate. Foot also stood in the London region for the Respect coalition in the 2004 European elections.

Foot&#x27;s last book, &quot;The Vote: How It Was Won and How It Was Undermined&quot;, was published posthumously in 2005. His friend and &quot;Private Eye&quot; colleague Francis Wheen, in his &quot;Guardian&quot; review, concluded: &quot;Passionate, energetic and invincibly cheerful: the qualities of his final book are also a monument to the man himself.&quot;

==Writing==
Foot wrote &quot;Red Shelley&quot; (1981), a book that exalted the radical politics of Percy Shelley&#x27;s poetry. Foot was a bibliophile, following in the steps of his grandfather Isaac and uncle Michael, and was also the author of a publication about the radical union leader A. J. Cook.

==Awards and campaign journalism==
Paul Foot was named journalist of the year in the &quot;What The Papers Say&quot; Awards in 1972 and 1989 and campaigning journalist of the year in the 1980 British Press Awards; he won the &quot;George Orwell Prize for Journalism&quot; in 1995 with Tim Laxton, won the journalist of the decade prize in the &quot;What The Papers Say&quot; Awards in 2000, and the James Cameron special posthumous Award in 2004.

His best known work was in the form of campaign journalism, including his exposure of corrupt architect John Poulson and, most notably, his prominent role in the campaigns to overturn the convictions of the Birmingham Six, which eventually succeeded in 1991. Foot also said that a former British intelligence officer, Colin Wallace, had been framed for manslaughter with a view to suppressing Wallace&#x27;s allegations of collusion between British forces and Loyalist paramilitaries in Northern Ireland during the 1970s.

Foot took a particular interest in the conviction of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi for the Lockerbie bombing, firmly believing Megrahi to have been a victim of a miscarriage of justice at the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial.

He also worked, though without success, to gain a posthumous pardon for James Hanratty, who was hanged in 1962 for the A6 murder. It was a position he maintained even after DNA evidence in 1999 confirmed Hanratty&#x27;s guilt.

==Personal life==
Paul Foot was married twice, to Monica (née Beckinsale, 1962–70) and Rose (Roseanne, née Harvey, 1971–93) and had a long-term relationship with Clare Fermont. He had two sons by his first wife, one son by his second, and a daughter by his relationship with Fermont: John Foot is an academic and writer specialising in Italy, Matt Foot is a solicitor, and Tom Foot is a journalist. With Fermont, Foot had a daughter, Kate.

Foot was a great admirer of West Indian cricket (he used to say that George Headley had taught him to bat) and a faithful follower of Plymouth Argyle Football Club. He was also a batsman and golfer.

==Death and memorials==

Paul Foot died of a heart attack at the age of 66. A tribute issue of the &quot;Socialist Review&quot;, on whose editorial board Foot sat for 19 years, collected together many of his articles, while issue 1116 of &quot;Private Eye&quot; included a tribute to Foot from the many people with whom he had worked. Three months after his death, on 10 October 2004, there was a full house at the Hackney Empire in London for an evening&#x27;s celebration of his life. The following year, &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;Private Eye&quot; jointly set up the Paul Foot Award for investigative or campaigning journalism, with an annual £10,000 prize fund.

Foot is buried in Highgate Cemetery, London, near Karl Marx&#x27;s tomb, with the grave of Chris Harman, another long-time SWP member, adjacent to Foot&#x27;s.

<text>Austhorpe is a civil parish and residential suburb of east Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. It is to the east of city centre and close to the A6120 dual carriageway (Leeds Outer Ring Road) and the M1 motorway.

==Location==
The area is situated between Pendas Fields to the north, Cross Gates to the north west, Whitkirk to the west, and Colton to the south and Garforth to the east.

Officially judging by the old boundaries of the former Austhorpe township, Austhorpe also includes the areas of Cross Gates, Colton Common and Barrowby. Colton Common became officially part of Colton when the Ingram family of Temple Newsam kept it for their own after buying and then selling the rest of the Austhorpe Lodge estate. It crosses both of the Cross Gates and Whinmoor (including Austhorpe Hall) and Temple Newsam wards of Leeds City Council.

The current east half of the civil parish of Austhorpe and large Thorpe Park business park lie in the western tip of Garforth and Swillington ward. Austhorpe Parish Council declared nil balance accounts for the financial year ended 31 March 2017.

Austhorpe lies in the LS15 postcode area. At the 2011 Census, the population of Austhorpe was shown to be included in Cross Gates and Whinmoor ward.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Austhorpe&quot; is first attested in the Domesday Book in the form &quot;Ossetorp&quot;. Like a significant number of Yorkshire place-names, the name comes from Old Norse. The first element is from Old Norse &quot;austr&quot; (&#x27;east&#x27;) and the second from Old Norse &quot;þorp&quot; (&#x27;outlying farmstead, secondary settlement&#x27;), an element found widely in the area (in names such as Osmandthorpe and Thorp Arch).

Meanwhile, the place-name &quot;Barrowby&quot;, found within the township of Austhorpe, is first attested in 1236, in the form &quot;Bergeby&quot;. The name comes from Old Norse &quot;berg&quot; (&#x27;hill&#x27;) and &quot;bý&quot; (&#x27;farmstead, village&#x27;).

==History==
After the Township dissolved, Austhorpe stopped developing as quickly as it was doing, possibly due to the once abundant coal fields close to the surface which had been a major source of commerce for the area since Roman times becoming empty with deep shaft mining proving to be unsuccessful compared to the close by coal source at Garforth. Whereas Cross Gates and Colton quickly developed, Barrowby, if anything, did not develop.

Pioneering Civil Engineer John Smeaton, designer of the longest standing Eddystone Lighthouse, was born in Austhorpe. Leeds band the Kaiser Chiefs make a positive reference to him in their hit song &quot;&quot;I Predict a Riot&quot;.&quot;

Austhorpe Hall is a grade II* listed building dated from 1694.

<doc id="422642" wikidata="Q1193" url="?curid=422642" title="Manipur">
<text>Manipur () is a landlocked state in northeast India with Imphal as its capital. It borders Assam to the west, Mizoram to the south, and Nagaland to the north. It shares international borders with Myanmar, specifically the Sagaing Region to the east and Chin State to the southeast. Covering an area of 8,621 square miles (22,330 km²), the state consists mostly of hilly terrain with the 700-square-mile Imphal Valley inhabited by the Meitei (Manipuri) community, historically a kingdom. Surrounding hills are home to Naga and Kuki-Zo communities, who speak Tibeto-Burman languages. The official language and lingua franca, Meitei (Manipuri), also belongs to the Tibeto-Burman family.

During the days of the British Raj, Manipur was one of the princely states. Prior to the British departure in 1947, Manipur acceded to the Dominion of India, along with roughly 550 other princely states. In September 1949, the ruler of Manipur signed a merger agreement with India, giving up his kingdom and obtaining a privy purse in return. Many Meitei people feel that their self-determination was violated by the agreement since the legislature elected under the constitution was not consulted. Followed by contestation of the merger by groups in Manipur, resulting in a 50-year insurgency in the state for independence from India. From 2009 through 2018, the conflict was responsible for the violent deaths of over 1000 people.

The Meitei people represent around 53% of the population of Manipur state, followed by various Naga tribes at 20% and Kuki-Zo tribes at 16%. Manipur&#x27;s ethnic groups practice a variety of religions. According to 2011 census, Hinduism and Christianity are the major religions of the state.

Manipur has primarily an agrarian economy, with significant hydroelectric power generation potential. It is connected to other areas by daily flights through Imphal Airport, the second largest in northeastern India. Manipur is home to many sports and the origin of Manipuri dance, and is credited with introducing polo to Europeans.

==Name==
The name Manipur () was chosen by Gharib Nawaz, a convert to Hinduism, in the eighteenth century. It is named after a kingdom of the same name mentioned in the Hindu epic Mahabharata. Previously, it had been known as Kangleipak or , Later, the work &quot;Dharani Samhita&quot; (1825–34) popularised the Sanskrit legends of the origin of Manipur&#x27;s name.

Other names include Sanaleibak , not given because Manipur has a lot of the gold mines, but because of its happiness and prosperity. This name was mentioned in the 11th-12th century constitution, the Loiyumba Shinyen. and is still heard in the official song of Manipur, &quot;Sana Leibak Manipur&quot;.

==History==
===Antiquity===

The history of Manipur Meiteis is chronicled in Puyas or Puwaris (stories about the forefathers), namely, the Ninghthou Kangbalon, Cheitharol Kumbaba, Ningthourol Lambuba, Poireiton Khunthokpa, Panthoibi Khongkul, and so forth in the Meitei script, which is comparable to the Thai script. The historical accounts presented here were recordings from the eyes and the judgment of Meitei kings and (Meitei scholars).

====The Kingdom of Mongkawng and Mongmao====
According to the Tai chronicles, Manipur (Kahse) is one of the territories conquered by Samlongpha (1150–1201), the first Chao Pha of Mongkawng. A 14th-century inscription from Pagan, Myanmar, mentions Kasan (Manipur) as one of the 21 states under the Mong Mao ruler Thonganbwa (1413–1445/6); he later was captured by the Governor of Taungdwingyi.

===Medieval===
====Vassal State of the Toungoo empire====
Bayinnaung, the ruler of Toungoo dynasty ordered the invasion of Manipur in 1559. He had recalled Binnya Dala from Chiang Mai to lead the invasion. The three armies mostly made up of army from Kale, Mohnyin, Mogaung, Momeik and Sanda led the invasion, the King of Manipur surrendered without any resistance and Manipur became a vassal state of the
Toungoo empire.

====Vassal state of Konbaung dynasty====
In the 18th century, Bodawpaya, the king of Burma acquired the Manipur (1814) along with the western kingdoms of Arakan (1784), Assam (1817).

By the medieval period, marriage alliances between the royal families of Manipur, Ahom kingdom and Burma had become common. Medieval era manuscripts discovered in the 20th century, particularly the &quot;Puya&quot;, provide evidence that Hindus from the Indian subcontinent had married Manipur royalty by at least the 14th century. In centuries thereafter, royal spouses came also from what is now Assam, Bengal, and Uttar Pradesh and from other South Indian kingdoms as well. Another manuscript suggests that Muslims arrived in Manipur in the 17th century, from what is now Bangladesh, during the reign of Meidingu Khagemba. The socio-political turmoil and wars, particularly the persistent and devastating Anglo-Burmese wars, affected the cultural and religious demography of Manipur.

===British colonial period===

In 1824, the ruler of Manipur entered into a subsidiary alliance with the British Empire in the Indian subcontinent, which became responsible for Manipur&#x27;s external defence. The British recognised that the state remained internally self-governing, as a princely state. During World War II, Manipur was the scene of many fierce battles between Japanese invaders and British Indian forces. The Japanese were beaten back before they could enter Imphal, which was one of the turning points of the overall war in South Asia. The Battle of Imphal, known to the Manipuris as &quot;Japan Laan&quot;, are among the lesser-known battles of the Second World War. Yet the Allied Victory in this battle was a turning point against the Japanese in East Asia.

===Post-colonial history===
After the war, the Maharaja took the advice of the British Cabinet Mission and the Chamber of Princes to introduce democratic reforms in the state.
The Manipur State Constitution Act of 1947 was promulgated in July 1947 to give the state an elected legislative assembly and an appointed prime minister.
Elections to the assembly were held only in the following year.

Following the decision to partition British India, all the princely states were advised to &quot;accede&quot; to one of the new dominions. The Maharaja acceded to India on 11 August 1947 and signed a standstill agreement to continue all the pre-existing arrangements it had with British India.
Some Meitei people argue that the king was in no legal position to sign the instrument of accession at the time.

Over the next two years, the multitude of princely states of India were extensively reorganised as India moved towards becoming a constitutional republic. Proposals for reorganisation were also made for Manipur but discarded as being unsuitable. Eventually Manipur was turned into a centrally administered province (called a &#x27;Part C&#x27; state, later renamed union territory) by asking the Maharaja to sign a merger agreement. He is believed to have signed it under duress.
Later, on 21 September 1949, he signed a Merger Agreement, disputed as having been done without consultation of the popular ministry under Manipur State Constitution Act 1947 and denial of the king&#x27;s request to return to Manipur to discuss the same with his people.
Under &#x27;duress&#x27; and &#x27;coercion&#x27; Bodhachandra Singh signed the merger agreement merging the kingdom into India, which led to its becoming a Part C State.

The legislative assembly was dissolved and a centrally appointed Chief Commissioner handled the state&#x27;s administration, as per the Constitution of India. An advisory council with nominated members was provided to advise the Chief Commissioner. In 1956, the advisory council was replaced by a territorial council with mostly elected members. In 1963, Manipur was provided a legislative assembly, with a council of ministers headed by a chief minister.
It was made a fully-fledged state in 1972 by the North-Eastern Areas (Reorganisation) Act, 1971.
Manipur has a long record of insurgency and inter-ethnic violence. Its first armed opposition group, the United National Liberation Front (UNLF), was founded in 1964 aiming to achieve independence from India and establish Manipur as a new country. Over time, many more groups formed, each with different goals, and deriving support from diverse ethnic groups in Manipur. The People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak (PREPAK) was formed in 1977, and the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) in 1978, suspected by Human Rights Watch of receiving arms and training from China. In 1980, the Kangleipak Communist Party (KCP) was formed. These groups began a spree of bank robberies and attacks on police officers and government buildings. The state government appealed to the central government in New Delhi for support in combating this violence.

====&quot;Disturbed area&quot; designation====
From 1980 to 2004, the Indian government referred to Manipur as a &quot;disturbed area.&quot; This term (designated by the Ministry of Home Affairs or a state governor) refers to a territory where extraordinary laws under the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act can be used. The laws allow the military to treat private and public spaces in the same manner, detain individuals for up to 24 hours with unlimited renewals, perform warrantless searches, and to shoot and kill individuals who break laws, carry weapons, or gather in groups larger than four. Legal immunity applies to the military. Since 1980, the application of AFSPA has been at the heart of concerns about human rights violations in the region, such as arbitrary killings, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, and forced disappearances. Its continued application has led to numerous protests, notably the longstanding hunger strike by Irom Sharmila Chanu.

In 2004, the government lifted the &quot;disturbed&quot; status after a violent attack on a local woman. The rape of a Manipuri woman, Thangjam Manorama Devi, by members of the Assam Rifles paramilitary had led to wide protests including a nude protest by the Meira Paibi women&#x27;s association.

====2023 ethnic violence====

In May 2023, an ethnic clash between Meitei people and Kuki people led to extensive violence and arson, resulting in 60,000 people displaced from their homes and hundreds more dead and hospitalized. According to data released by Manipur Police, as on September 15, 2023; 175 people have been killed; 1,118 people were injured, and 33 people were missing. 96 bodies remained unclaimed. 5,172 cases of arson including destruction of 4,786 houses and 386 religious places, out of which there were 254 churches and 132 temples, were reported since May. Out of 5,668 arms lost; 1,329 arms, 15,050 ammunition and 400 bombs were recovered. Indian army troops were deployed to control the situation. International outrage resulted from a report that two Kuki women had been paraded naked and allegedly gang-raped by a mob of Meitei men.

==Geography==
The state lies at a latitude of 23°83&#x27;N – 25°68&#x27;N and a longitude of 93°03&#x27;E – 94°78&#x27;E. The total area covered by the state is . The capital lies in an oval-shaped valley of approximately , surrounded by blue mountains, at an elevation of above sea level. The slope of the valley is from north to south. The mountain ranges create a moderate climate, preventing the cold winds from the north from reaching the valley and barring cyclonic storms.

The state is bordered by the Indian states of Nagaland to its north, Mizoram to its south, Assam to its west, and shares an international border with Myanmar to its east.
The state has four major river basins: the Barak River Basin (Barak Valley) to the west, the Manipur River Basin in central Manipur, the Yu River Basin in the east, and a portion of the Lanye River Basin in the north. The water resources of Barak and Manipur river basins are about 1.8487 Mham (million hectare metres). The overall water balance of the state amounts to 0.7236 Mham in the annual water budget. (By comparison, India receives 400 Mham of rain annually.)

The Barak River, the largest of Manipur, originates in the Manipur Hills and is joined by tributaries, such as the Irang, Maku, and Tuivai. After its junction with the Tuivai, the Barak River turns north, forms the border with Assam State, and then enters the Cachar Assam just above Lakhipur. The Manipur river basin has eight major rivers: the Manipur, Imphal, Iril, Nambul, Sekmai, Chakpi, Thoubal and Khuga. All these rivers originate from the surrounding hills.

Almost all the rivers in the valley area are in the mature stage and therefore deposit their sediment load in the Loktak Lake. The rivers draining the Manipur Hills are comparatively young, due to the hilly terrain through which they flow. These rivers are corrosive and become turbulent in the rainy season. Important rivers draining the western area include the Maku, Barak, Jiri, Irang, and Leimatak. Rivers draining the eastern part of the state, the Yu River Basin, include the Chamu, Khunou and other short streams.

Manipur may be characterised as two distinct physical regions: an outlying area of rugged hills and narrow valleys, and the inner area of flat plain, with all associated landforms. These two areas are distinct in physical features and are conspicuous in flora and fauna. The valley region has hills and mounds rising above the flat surface. The Loktak Lake is an important feature of the central plain. The total area occupied by all the lakes is about 600 km2. The altitude ranges from 40 m at Jiribam to 2,994 m at Mount Tempü peak along the border with Nagaland.

The soil cover can be divided into two broad types, viz. the red ferruginous soil in the hill area and the alluvium in the valley. The valley soils generally contain loam, small rock fragments, sand, and sandy clay, and are varied. On the plains, especially flood plains and deltas, the soil is quite thick. The topsoil on the steep slopes is very thin. Soil on the steep hill slopes is subject to high erosion, resulting in gullies and barren rock slopes. The normal pH value ranges from 5.4 to 6.8.

===Flora===

Natural vegetation occupies an area of about , or 77.2% of the total geographical area of the state, and consists of short and tall grasses, reeds and bamboos, and trees.

There are forests of teak, pine, oak, uningthou, leihao, bamboo, and cane. Rubber, tea, coffee, orange, and cardamom are grown in hill areas. Rice is a staple food for Manipuris.

===Climate===
Manipur&#x27;s climate is largely influenced by the topography of the region. Lying 790 metres above sea level, Manipur is wedged among hills on all sides. This northeastern corner of India enjoys a generally amiable climate, though the winters can be chilly. The maximum temperature in the summer months is . The coldest month is January, and the warmest July.

The state receives an average annual rainfall of between April and mid-October. Precipitation ranges from light drizzle to heavy downpour. The capital city Imphal receives an annual average of . Rainfall in this region is caused by The South Westerly Monsoon picking up moisture from the Bay of Bengal and heading towards the Eastern Himalaya ranges. This normal rainfall pattern of Manipur enriches the soil and much of the agrarian activities are dependent on it as well.

Manipur is already experiencing climate change, especially changes in weather, with both increased variability in rain as well as increasingly severe changes in temperature.

==Demographics==
===Population===
Manipur had a population of 2,855,794 at the 2011 census. Of this total, 57.2% lived in the valley districts and the remaining 42.8% in the hill districts. The valley (plain) is mainly inhabited by the Meitei speaking population (native Manipuri speakers). The hills are inhabited mainly by several ethno-linguistically diverse tribes belonging to the Nagas, the Kukis and smaller tribal groupings. Naga and Kuki settlements are also found in the valley region, though less in numbers. There are also sizable population of Nepalis, Bengalis, Tamils and Marwaris living in Manipur.

The distribution of area, population and density, and literacy rate as per the 2001 Census provisional figures are as below:
===People===

The Meiteis (synonymous to the Manipuris) constitute the majority of the state&#x27;s population. They inhabit the Imphal Valley. Nagas and Kuki-Zo are the major tribe conglomerates of tribes inhabiting the surrounding hills. The Kuki-Zos consist of several tribes including Gangte, Hmar, Paite, Simte, Sukte, Thadou, Vaiphei, Zou, and some smaller tribes. They speak Kuki-Chin languages and predominate the southern hill districts of Manipur. The prominent Naga tribes are Angami, Kabui, Kacha Naga, Mao, Maram, Poumai, Sema and Tangkhul, each speaking its own language. They predominate the northern hill districts of Manipur. In addition, several smaller tribes that were classified as &quot;Old Kuki&quot; by the British administrators populate Chandel and neighbouring districts. Some of them now classify themselves as Nagas while others retain the Kuki classification.
===Languages===


The official language of the state is Meitei (also known as &quot;Manipuri&quot;). It is a scheduled language in the Republic of India, and serves as the lingua franca in Manipur.

Other than Meitei language, in Manipur, there is a huge amount of linguistic diversity, as is the case in most of the Northeast India. Almost all of the languages are Sino-Tibetan, with many different subgroups represented. There are multiple Kuki-Chin languages, the largest being Thadou and is spoken in all the hill districts. Another major language family is the Naga languages, like Tangkhul, Poula, Rongmei and Mao. Less than 5% speak Indo-European languages, mostly Nepali and Sylheti (also considered as a dialect of Bengali), which is the major language of Jiribam district.

The Directorate of Language Planning and Implementation (AKA Department of Language Planning and Implementation) of the Government of Manipur works for the development and the promotion of Meitei language and other local vernaculars of Manipur.

==Religion==
Hinduism and Christianity are the major religions practiced in Manipur. Between the 1961 and 2011 censuses of India, the share of Hindus in the state declined from 62% to 41%, while the share of Christians rose from 19% to 41%. The religious groups of the Meitei-speaking people include Hindus, Sanamahists, Meitei Christians and Meitei Pangals. Besides these, the non Meitei-speaking communities (tribals) are mostly Christians.

===Hinduism===
The Meitei ethnicity (aka Manipuri people) is the majority group following Hinduism in Manipur, beside other minor immigrants following the same faith in the state. Among the indigenous communities of Manipur, Meiteis are the only Hindus as no other indigenous ethnic groups follow this faith.
According to the 2011 Census of India, about 41.39% of the Manipuri people practice Hinduism. The Hindu population is heavily concentrated in the Meitei dominant areas of the Manipur Valley (Imphal Valley), among the Meitei people. The districts of Bishnupur, Thoubal, Imphal East, and Imphal West all have Hindu majorities, averaging 67.62% (range 62.27–74.81%) according to the 2011 census data.

Vaishnavite Hinduism was the state religion of the Kingdom of Manipur. In 1704, Meitei King Charairongba accepted Vaishnavism and changed his traditional Meitei name into Hindu name, Pitambar Singh. However, the first Hindu temples were constructed much earlier. A copper plate excavated from Phayeng dating back to 763 CE (believed to be of the reign of Meitei King Khongtekcha) was found to contain inscriptions about the Hindu deities in Sanskrit words. During the 13th century, Meitei King Khumomba constructed a Lord Hanuman temple. The Vishnu temple at Lamangdong was constructed during 1474 CE (during the reign of Meitei King Kiyamba), by Brahmins immigrating from the neighborhood Shan State. As per the legends, the temple was constructed to house the Vishnu emblem given to King Kiyamba by King Khekhomba of Shan. Phurailatpam Shubhi Narayan was the first Brahmin priest of this temple.

===Christianity===

Christianity is the religion of 41% of the people in the state, but is the majority in rural areas with 53%, and is predominant in the hills. It was brought by Protestant missionaries to Manipur in the 19th century. In the 20th century, a few Christian schools were established, which introduced Western-type education. Christianity is the predominant religion among tribals of Manipur and tribal Christians make up the vast majority (over 96%) of the Christian population in Manipur.

===Islam===

The Meitei Pangals (), also known as Meitei Muslims or Manipuri Muslims, are the third largest religious majority group in the state, comprising about 8.3% of the state population. They belong to the Sunni group of the Hanafi school of Islamic thought and they include Arabs, Bangladeshis, Turanis, Bengalis and Chaghtai Turks.

===Sanamahism===

Sanamahism is the indigenous, polytheistic and animistic ethnic religion of the Meitei people. Sanamahist worship concentrates on the household deity Lainingthou Sanamahi. The ancient Meiteis worshiped a Supreme deity, Salailen, and followed their ancestors. Their ancestor worship and animism was based on Umang Lai – ethnic governing deities worshiped in the sacred groves. Some of the traditional Meitei deities, or Lais are Atiya Sidaba, Pakhangba, Sanamahi, and Panthoibi. Out of the 233,767 people who opted for the &quot;Other religion&quot; option, 222,315 were Sanamahists.

===Civil unrest===
====Social movements====
There were many public movements in Manipur against the government:
* Meitei classical language movement
* Meitei scheduled language movement
* Meitei linguistic purism movement

====Security and insurgency====
The violence in Manipur extends beyond the conflict between Indian security forces and insurgent armed groups. There is violence between the Meitei ethnicity, various Naga tribes, various Kuki tribes, and other tribal groups.

Splinter groups have arisen within some of the armed groups, and disagreement between them is rife. Other than the UNLF, PLA, and PREPAK, Manipuri insurgent groups include the Revolutionary Peoples Front (RPF), Manipur Liberation Front Army (MLFA), Kanglei Yawol Kanba Lup (KYKL), Revolutionary Joint Committee (RJC), Kangleipak Communist Party (KCP), Peoples United Liberation Front (PULF), Manipur Naga People Front (MNPF), National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN-K), National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN-I/M), United Kuki Liberation Front (UKLF), Kuki National Front (KNF), Kuki National Army (KNA), Kuki Defence Force (KDF), Kuki Democratic Movement (KDM), Kuki National Organisation (KNO), Kuki Security Force (KSF), Chin Kuki Revolutionary Front (CKRF), Kom Rem Peoples Convention (KRPC), Zomi Revolutionary Volunteers (ZRV), Zomi Revolutionary Army (ZRA), Zomi Reunification Organisation (ZRO), and Hmar Peoples Convention (HPC).

The Meitei insurgent groups seek independence from India. The Kuki insurgent groups want a separate state for the Kukis to be carved out from the present state of Manipur. The Kuki insurgent groups are under two umbrella organisations: the Kuki National Organisation (KNO) and United Peoples Forum. The Nagas wish to annex part of Manipur and merge with a greater Nagaland or Nagalim, which is in conflict with Meitei insurgent demands for the integrity of their vision of an independent state. There have been many tensions between the tribes and numerous clashes between Naga and Kukis, Meiteis and Muslims.

According to SATP in 2014, there had been a dramatic decline in fatalities in Manipur since 2009. In 2009, 77 civilians died (about 3 per 100,000 people). From 2010 onward, about 25 civilians have died in militant-related violence (about 1 per 100,000 people), dropping further to 21 civilian deaths in 2013 (or 0.8 per 100,000 people). However, there were 76 explosions in 2013 compared to 107 in 2012. Different groups have claimed responsibility for the explosions, some claiming they were targeting competing militant groups, others claiming their targets were state and central government officials.
As a point of comparison, the average annual global rate of violent death between 2004 and 2009 was 7.9 per 100,000 people.

==Economy==

Manipur acts as India&#x27;s &quot;Gateway to the East&quot; through Moreh and Tamu towns, the land route for trade between India and Burma and other countries in Southeast Asia, East Asia, Siberia, the Arctic, Micronesia and Polynesia. Manipur has the highest number of handicraft units and the highest number of craftspersons in the northeastern region of India.

===Electricity===
Manipur produced about of electricity in 2010 with its infrastructure. The state has hydroelectric power generation potential, estimated to be over . As of 2010, if half of this potential is realised, it is estimated that this would supply 24/7 electricity to all residents, with a surplus for sale, as well as supplying the Burma power grid.

===Agriculture===
Manipur&#x27;s climate and soil conditions make it ideally suited for horticultural crops. Growing there are rare and exotic medicinal and aromatic plants. Some cash crops suited for Manipur include Lychee, Cashew, Walnut, Orange, Lemon, Pineapple, Papaya, Passion Fruit, Peach, Pear and Plum. The state is covered with over of bamboo forests, making it one of India&#x27;s largest contributor to its bamboo industry.

Agriculture in Manipur includes a number of smallholding farms, many of whom are owned by women. Climate change, especially changes in temperature and weather are hurting small farmers in the state. Like rural women in other parts of the world, women in agriculture in Manipur are harmed more by the changes in weather, because of less access to support from local governments.

===Transportation infrastructure===

Tulihal Airport, Changangei, Imphal, the only airport of Manipur, connects directly with Delhi, Kolkata, Guwahati, and Agartala. It has been upgraded to an international airport. As India&#x27;s second largest airport in the northeast, it serves as a key logistical centre for northeastern states. The Tulihal Airport has been renamed Bir Tikendrajit Airport. National Highway NH-39 links Manipur with the rest of the country through the railway stations at Dimapur in Nagaland at a distance of from Imphal.

The road network of Manipur, with a length of connects all the important towns and distant villages. However, the road condition throughout the state is often deplorable. In 2010, Indian government announced that it is considering an Asian infrastructure network from Manipur to Vietnam. The proposed Trans-Asian Railway (TAR), if constructed, will pass through Manipur, connecting India to Burma, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore.

===Tourism===

==Art and culture ==
Secular theatre is mostly confined to themes that are not religious; it is performed in the secular or profane spheres. In these are &quot;Shumang lila&quot; and &quot;Phampak lila&quot; (stage drama). &quot;Shumang lila&quot; is very popular. Etymologically Shumang lila is the combination of &quot;Shumang&quot; (courtyard) and &quot;Lila&quot; (play or performance). It is performed in an area of 13×13 ft in the centre of any open space, in a very simple style without a raised stage, set design, or heavy props such as curtains, background scenery, and visual effects. It uses one table and two chairs, kept on one side of the performance space. Its claim as the &quot;theatre of the masses&quot; is underlined by the way it is performed in the middle of an audience that surrounds it, leaving one passage as entrance and exit.

The world of &quot;Phampak lila&quot; (stage drama) performed in the proscenium theatre is similar, in form, to the Western theatrical model and Indian Natyasastra model though its contents are indigenous. The so-called modern theatre descended on Manipur theatre culture with the performance of Pravas Milan (1902) under the enthusiastic patronage of Sir Churchand Maharaj (1891–1941). The pace of theatrical movement was geared up with the institution of groups such as Manipur Dramatic Union (MDU) (1930), Arian Theatre (1935), Chitrangada Natya Mandir (1936), Society Theatre (1937), Rupmahal (1942), Cosmopolitan Dramatic Union (1968), and the Chorus Repertory Theatre of Ratan Thiyam (1976). These groups started experimenting with types of plays apart from historical and Puranic ones. Today Manipur theatre is well respected because of excellent productions shown in India and abroad. Manipur plays, both &quot;Shumang lila&quot; and &quot;stage lila&quot;, have been a regular feature in the annual festival of the National School of Drama, New Delhi.

Iskcon led by Bhaktisvarupa Damodara Swami started a network of schools in Northeastern India, where more than 4,000 students receive education centred on Vaishnava spiritual values. In 1989 he founded &quot;Ranganiketan Manipuri Cultural Arts Troupe&quot;, which has approximately 600 performances at over 300 venues in over 15 countries. Ranganiketan (literally &quot;House of Colorful Arts&quot;) is a group of more than 20 dancers, musicians, singers, martial artists, choreographers, and craft artisans. Some of them have received international acclaim.

===Manipur dance (Ras Lila)===
Manipuri dance also known as Jagoi, is one of the major Indian classical dance forms, named after the state of Manipur. It is particularly known for its Hindu Vaishnavism themes, and exquisite performances of love-inspired dance drama of Radha-Krishna called Raslila. However, the dance is also performed to themes related to Shaivism, Shaktism and regional deities such as Umang Lai during Lai Haraoba. The roots of Manipur dance, as with all classical Indian dances, is the ancient Hindu Sanskrit text &quot;Natya Shastra&quot;, but with influences from the culture fusion between India and Southeast Asia, East Asia, Siberia, Micronesia and Polynesia.

===Chorus Repertory Theatre===
The auditorium of the theatre is on the outskirts of Imphal and the campus stretches for about . It has housing and working quarters to accommodate self-sufficiency of life. The theatre association has churned out internationally acclaimed plays like &quot;Chakravyuha&quot; and &quot;Uttarpriyadashi&quot;. Its 25 years of existence in theatre had disciplined its performers to a world of excellence. &quot;Chakravyuha&quot; taken from the Mahabharat epic had won Fringe Firsts Award, 1987 at the Edinburgh International Theater Festival. &quot;Chakravyuha&quot; deals with the story of Abhimanyu (son of Arjun) of his last battle and approaching death, whereas &quot;Uttarpriyadashi&quot; is an 80-minute exposition of Emperor Ashoka&#x27;s redemption.

==Sports==
Mukna is a popular form of wrestling. Mukna Kangjei, or &quot;Khong Kangjei&quot;, is a game which combines the arts of mukna (wrestling hockey) and Kangjei (Cane Stick) to play the ball made of seasoned bamboo roots.

Yubi lakpi is a traditional full contact game played in Manipur, India, using a coconut, which has some notable similarities to rugby. &quot;Yubi lakpi&quot; literally means &quot;coconut snatching&quot;. The coconut is greased to make it slippery. There are rules of the game, as with all Manipur sports. The coconut serves the purpose of a ball and is offered to the king, the chief guest or the judges before the game begins. The aim is to run while carrying the greased coconut and physically cross over the goal line, while the other team tackles and blocks any such attempt as well as tries to grab the coconut and score on its own. In Manipur&#x27;s long history, Yubi lakpi was the annual official game, attended by the king, over the Hindu festival of Shree Govindajee. It is like the game of rugby, or American football.

Oolaobi (Woo-Laobi) is an outdoor game mainly played by females. Meitei mythology believes that UmangLai Heloi-Taret (seven deities–seven fairies) played this game on the Courtyard of the temple of Umang Lai Lairembi. The number of participants is not fixed but are divided into two groups (size as per agreement). Players are divided as into Raiders (Attackers) or Defenders (Avoiders). &quot;Hiyang Tannaba&quot;, also called &quot;Hi Yangba Tanaba&quot;, is a traditional boat rowing race and festivity of the Panas.

===Polo===

The origin of modern polo can be traced to Manipur where the world&#x27;s oldest polo ground lies, Imphal Polo Ground. Captain Robert Stewart and Lieutenant Joseph Sherer of the British colonial era first watched locals play a rules-based &quot;pulu&quot; or &quot;sagolkangjei&quot; (literally, horse and stick) game in 1859. They adopted its rules, calling the game polo, and playing it on their horses. The game spread among the British in Calcutta and then to England.

Apart from these games, some outdoor children&#x27;s games are fading in popularity. Some games such as Khutlokpi, Phibul Thomba, and Chaphu Thugaibi remain very popular elsewhere, such as in Cambodia. They are played especially during the Khmer New Year.

First of its kind in India, National Sports University will be constructed in Manipur.

==Festivals==

The festivals of Manipur are Lui-ngai-ni Ningol Chakouba, Shirui Lily festival, Yaoshang, Gan-ngai, Chumpha, Cheiraoba, Kang and Heikru Hidongba, as well as the broader religious festivals Eid-Ul-Fitr, Eid-Ul-Adha and Christmas. Most of these festivals are celebrated on the basis of the lunar calendar. Almost every festival celebrated in other states of India is observed.

On 21 November 2017, the Sangai Festival 2017 was inaugurated by President Ram Nath Kovind in Manipur. Held for 10 days, the festival is named after Manipur&#x27;s state animal, the brow-antlered Sangai deer.

Besides the feast, gifts are given to the women/invitees and to their children. It is the festival that binds and revives the family relations between the women married away and the parental family. Nowadays, other communities have started celebrating this kind of a family-bonding festival.

===Kut===
Held after the Harvest festival in November, this festival predominantly celebrated by Kuki-Chin-Mizo tribes in Manipur has become one of the leading festivals of the state. Kut is not restricted to a community or tribe — the whole state populace participates in merriment. On 1 November of every year, the state declared holiday for Kut celebration.

===Yaosang===

Held in February or March, Yaosang is considered to be one of the biggest festivals of Manipur. It is the Holi festival (festival of colour) but Yaosang is the regional name given by the people of Manipur.

===Khuado Pawi===
Khuado Pawi is the harvest festival of the Tedim people who were recognised as Sukte and Zomi in India and Myanmar respectively. The word Pawi means festival in Tedim Zomi language. It is celebrated every year in the month of September–October after harvesting.

==Geographical indication==
===Chak-Hao (Black rice)===
Chak-Hao was awarded the Geographical Indication (GI) status tag from the Geographical Indications Registry, under the Union Government of India, on 20 April 2020 and is valid until 25 December 2027.

Consortium of Producers of Chak-Hao (Black Rice) from Imphal, proposed the GI registration of Chak-Hao. After filing the application in December 2017, the rice was granted the GI tag in 2020 by the Geographical Indication Registry in Chennai, making the name &quot;Chak-Hao&quot; exclusive to the rice grown in the region. It thus became the first rice variety from Manipur and Nagaland. It also is the 5th type of goods from Manipur and 4th from Nagaland to earn the GI tag respectively.

The GI tag protects the rice from illegal selling and marketing, and gives it legal protection and a unique identity.

<text>[[SD card#History|Secure Digital]] Music Initiative (SDMI) was a forum formed in late 1998 ostensibly with the purpose of developing technology and rights management systems specifications that will protect once developed and installed, the playing, storing, distributing and performing of digital music.

It was composed of more than 200 IT, consumer electronics, security technology, ISP and recording industry companies, as well as authors, composers and publishing rightsholders (represented by CISAC and BIEM representatives, mainly from SGAE/SDAE (Gonzalo Mora Velarde and José Manuel Macarro), GEMA (Alexander Wolf und Thomas Kummer-Hardt), SACEM/SDRM (Aline Jelen, Catherine Champarnaud, Laurent Lemasson), MCPS/PRS (Mark Isherwood), ASCAP, BMI (Edward Oshanani), and SODRAC), 

Specifically, the goals of the SDMI were to provide consumers with convenient access to music online and in new digital distribution systems, to apply digital rights management restrictions to the work of artists, and to promote the development of new music-related business and technologies. SDMI was a direct response to the widespread success of the MP3 file format.

According to their web site, SDMI existed to develop “technology specifications that protect the playing, storing, and distributing of digital music such that a new market for digital music may emerge.” It would have been used by DataPlay, an optical disc format that at the time was cheaper and had higher capacity than memory cards, and by SD cards.

==Method==

The strategy for the SDMI group involved two stages. The first was to implement a secure digital watermarking scheme. This would allow music to be tagged with a secure watermark that was hard to remove from the source audio without damaging it. The second was to ensure that SDMI-compliant players would not play SDMI tagged music that was not authorized for that device. The reasoning was that even if the files were distributed they could not be played as the device would detect the music was not authorized to be played on it.

==Challenges==

A key part of the strategy included demonstrating that the watermarking could not be detected by third parties and as a result be removed from the music. As part of the process of ratifying the technology the SDMI announced a challenge with their &quot;Open Letter to the Digital Community&quot; on September 6, 2000. The letter invited hackers, cryptologists and others to detect and remove the watermark from some example pieces of music. Several groups became involved, including a group led by Ed Felten. Felten&#x27;s group claimed to have cracked the scheme and successfully removed the watermark according to the automated judging software supplied by the SDMI. The SDMI disagreed, noting that there was a requirement that the files lose no sound quality and the automated system did not take this into account.

When Felten attempted to publish an academic paper describing the analysis of the SDMI scheme (having opted out of the confidentiality requirement that would have allowed him to claim $10,000 in prize money) the SDMI, RIAA and Verance Corporation threatened legal action under the auspices of the DMCA. The controversy about stifling of academic research resonated through scientific and cryptography circles until his paper was eventually published in 2001 after assurances from the United States Department of Justice that the DMCA would not be used to stifle legitimate research.

==Demise==

On October 15, 1999, Eric Scheirer, later a digital music analyst for Forrester Research, wrote an editorial for MP3.com titled &quot;The End of SDMI&quot; which declared that the group&#x27;s true goal to fold the technology industry into an alliance that would guarantee the record industry&#x27;s near monopoly over musical content had failed. It drew a rebuttal from the president of the SDMI, Dr. Leonardo Chiariglione. The SDMI has been inactive since May 18, 2001.

Chiariglione stepped down as SDMI&#x27;s director in 2001, and later explained the reason for SDMI&#x27;s halt after his departure as follows:
:&quot;Unfortunately it turned out that none of the technologies submitted could satisfy the requirements set out at the beginning, e.g. of being unnoticeable by so-called &quot;golden ears&quot;. SDMI has then decided to suspend its work and wait for progress in technology.&quot;

<text>Edward Arthur Milne FRS (; 14 February 1896 – 21 September 1950) was a British astrophysicist and mathematician.

== Biography ==
Milne was born in Hull, Yorkshire, England. He attended Hymers College and from there he won an open scholarship in mathematics and natural science to study at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1914, gaining the largest number of marks which had ever been awarded in the examination. In 1916 he joined a group of mathematicians led by A. V. Hill for the Ministry of munitions working on the ballistics of anti-aircraft gunnery, they became known as ′Hill&#x27;s Brigands′. Later Milne became an expert on sound localisation. In 1917 he became a lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. He was a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, 1919–1925, being assistant director of the solar physics observatory, 1920–1924, mathematical lecturer at Trinity, 1924–1925, and university lecturer in astrophysics, 1922–1925. He was Beyer professor of applied mathematics, Victoria University of Manchester, 1924–1928, before his appointment as Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics and to a fellowship at Wadham College, Oxford, in 1928. Milne&#x27;s earlier work was in mathematical astrophysics. Much of his research in the 1930s was concerned with the theory of relativity and cosmology. His later work, concerned with the interior structure of stars, aroused controversy. Milne was President of the Royal Astronomical Society, 1943–1945. During World War II he again worked on ballistics.

Milne married Margaret Scott Campbell on 26June 1928 at Withington, Manchester. Campbell, from Dornoch, Sutherland, Scotland, was the daughter of Hugh Fraser Campbell, an advocate in Aberdeen. Milne&#x27;s brother, Geoffrey, then a lecturer in agricultural chemistry at the University of Leeds, was best man. Margaret Scott Milne died on the 5October 1938 at Oxford. He married secondly, Beatrice Brevoort Renwick, the third daughter of William Whetten Renwick, on 22June 1940 at St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Oxford. William Whetten was the nephew of American architect James Renwick Jr., and designed Saints Peter and Paul, a Roman Catholic cathedral in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States. Beatrice Brevoort Milne died at Oxford on 28August 1945, aged just 32 years. Milne died of a heart attack in Dublin, Ireland, while preparing to give a set of lectures. These can be found written down in one of his last published books: &quot;Modern Cosmology and the Christian Idea of God&quot; (1952).

==Research into stellar atmospheres and structure==
In the 1920s much of Milne&#x27;s research was concerned with stars, particularly the outer layers known as stellar atmospheres that produce the radiation observed from the Earth. He considered a grey atmosphere, a simplifying approximation in which the strength of the absorption of light by the hot ionized gas is the same at all wavelengths. This produced predictions of how temperature varies through the atmosphere, including the mathematical expression now known as the Milne Equation. He also calculated how the intensity of light from a star varies with wavelength on the basis of this model.

Milne moved on to consider the more realistic case where the strength of the absorption of light by gas within stars (expressed by the absorption coefficient) does vary with wavelength. Using simplifying assumptions he calculated how for the Sun
the strength of the absorption depends on wavelength. His results could not be explained adequately at the time, but later
negatively-charged hydrogen ions (H−) were shown to be a major contributor to Milne&#x27;s results.

Milne, working with Ralph H. Fowler, studied how the strengths of spectral lines of stars depend on their spectral type. In doing this they applied the work of Meghnad Saha about the ionization of gases to stellar atmospheres.

Milne worked on the structures and interiors of stars in the late 1920s and early 1930s. He often took opinions opposed to those of Arthur Eddington.

==Research into cosmology and relativity==
From the early 1930s, Milne&#x27;s interests focused increasingly on relativity theory and cosmology.

From 1932 he worked on the problem of the &quot;expanding universe&quot; and in &quot;Relativity, Gravitation, and World-Structure&quot; (1935), proposed an alternative to Albert Einstein&#x27;s general relativity theory. With McCrea (1934) he also showed that the 3 models which form the foundations of modern cosmology first proposed by Friedmann (1922) using the general theory of relativity, can also be derived using only Newtonian mechanics.

Milne&#x27;s alternative to general relativity theory based on kinematics was known as Kinematic Relativity. His theory was built on the special but not general theory of relativity. Because of this it has been described as a &quot;nonrelativistic cosmology&quot;. Milne’s theory met with opposition from others but inspired the steady-state theorists.

== &quot;Relativity, Gravitation, and World Structure&quot; ==
The main difference between the Milne model of an expanding universe, and the current (Einstein&#x27;s) model of an expanding universe was that Milne did not assume &quot;a priori&quot; that the universe has a homogeneous matter distribution. He did not include the gravitation interaction into the model either.

Milne argued that under the context of Einstein&#x27;s special relativity, and the relativity of simultaneity, that it is impossible for a nonstatic universe to be homogeneous. Namely, if the universe is spreading out, its density is decreasing over time, and that if two regions appeared to be at the same density at the same time to one observer, they would not appear to be the same density at the same time to another observer. However, if each observer measures its local density at the same agreed-upon proper time, the measured density should be the same. In Minkowskian coordinates, this constant proper time forms a hyperbolic surface which extends infinitely to the light-cone of the event of creation. This is true even when proper time approaches 0, the time of the creation. The universe is already infinite at the creation time!

Milne&#x27;s model is, therefore, that of a sphere, with an approximately homogeneous matter distribution within several billion light years of the center which then increases to an infinite density. It can be shown that this infinite density is actually the density of the universe when at the time of the big bang. The spherical distribution is unique in that it is essentially the same after a Lorentz transformation, except that a different stationary particle is at the center. As it is the only distribution that has this property, it is the only distribution which could satisfy the cosmological principle of &quot;no preferred reference frame.&quot; Based on this cosmological principle Milne created a model that can be described entirely within Euclidean geometry.

As of 1935, using this model, Milne published a prediction of the cosmic background radiation which appears to be of a much different character than that predicted by Eddington. In fact, many passages in &quot;Relativity, Gravitation and World Structure&quot; are devoted to attacking Eddington&#x27;s preconceptions.

==Religious views==

Milne was a Christian theist. In 1950, Milne gave ten lectures on Christianity and cosmology for the Edward Cadbury lectures which he was invited to give at the University of Birmingham. The lectures were published in the book &quot;Modern Cosmology and the Christian Idea of God&quot;, edited by Gerald James Whitrow and published in 1952.

Milne was a theistic evolutionist who held the view that God intervenes with &quot;deft touches&quot; to steer mutations in the right direction.

<text>Claudia Christian (born Claudia Ann Coghlan, August 10, 1965) is an American actress, known for her roles as Commander Susan Ivanova on &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, as Captain Maynard on Fox&#x27;s &quot;9-1-1&quot;, and as the voice of Hera on the Netflix series &quot;Blood of Zeus&quot;. She is also the voice of Lt. Helga Sinclair in &quot;.&quot; She is the founder and CEO of the C Three Foundation, a proponent of the medication-based Sinclair Method for treating alcohol dependence.

==Early life==
Christian was born in Glendale, California, the only daughter of Hildegard (&quot;née&quot; Christian), who worked as the director of Giorgio Beverly Hills, and James Michael Coghlan. Her mother is from Germany and her father has Irish ancestry. Christian and her three elder brothers were raised in Connecticut.

In addition, Christian played Janine Foster in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio drama &quot;The Reaping&quot; and appeared in the films &quot;The Garden&quot; with Lance Henriksen and &quot;Half Past Dead&quot; with Steven Seagal.

<doc id="422651" wikidata="Q342612" url="?curid=422651" title="Jeff Conaway">
<text>Jeffrey Charles William Michael Conaway (October 5, 1950 – May 27, 2011) was an American actor. He portrayed Kenickie in the film &quot;Grease&quot; and had roles in three television series: struggling actor Bobby Wheeler in &quot;Taxi&quot; (1978-1982), Prince Erik Greystone in &quot;Wizards and Warriors&quot;, and security officer Zack Allan on &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. Conaway was featured in the first and second seasons of the reality television series &quot;Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew&quot;.

==Early life==
Conaway was born on October 5, 1950, in Manhattan, New York, and raised in the Astoria, Flushing, and Forest Hills neighborhoods of Queens.

His father, Charles, was an actor, producer, and publisher. His mother, Helen, an actress who went by the stage name Mary Ann Brooks, taught music at New York City&#x27;s Brook Conservatory. They divorced when he was 3, and Conaway and his two older sisters lived with their mother.

He also spent time living with his grandparents in South Carolina, which gave him enough of a Southern accent that when he accompanied his mother to a casting call for director Arthur Penn&#x27;s Broadway play &quot;All the Way Home&quot;, a story set in Knoxville, Tennessee, the 10-year-old Conaway landed a featured role as one of four boys. The 1961 Pulitzer Prize-winning play was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Play and ran 333 performances and one preview from November 29, 1960, to September 16, 1961. Conaway remained for the entire run, then toured with the national company of the play &quot;Critic&#x27;s Choice&quot;.

Conaway worked as a child model, and he attended high school at the Quintano School for Young Professionals. After playing with the rock band beginning at age 15, he attended the North Carolina School of the Arts and later transferred to New York University.

==Career==
While at NYU, Conaway appeared in television commercials and had the lead in a school production of &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;. He made his film debut in the 1971 romantic drama &quot;Jennifer on My Mind&quot;, which also featured future stars Robert De Niro and Barry Bostwick.

===&quot;Grease&quot; and &quot;Taxi&quot;===
The following year, Conaway appeared in the original cast of the Broadway musical &quot;Grease&quot;, as an understudy to several roles including that of the lead male character, Danny Zuko, and eventually succeeded role-originator Barry Bostwick.

He played the role for years while his friend John Travolta, with whom he shared a manager, later joined the show, playing the supporting role of Doody. The two reunited in the 1978 motion picture musical &quot;Grease&quot;, in which Travolta played Zuko and Conaway his buddy Kenickie.

After breaking into series television in 1975 with &quot;Happy Days&quot;, followed by guest spots in several other TV shows, and three more films including &quot;Grease&quot;, he was cast as aspiring actor Bobby Wheeler on &quot;Taxi&quot;, which premiered in fall 1978.

He had appeared in an episode of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; for the same producers, and, he said in 1987, had been considered for the role of John Burns, which eventually went to Randall Carver:

Conaway left &quot;Taxi&quot; after the third season. Part of the reason was his drug abuse after season one. &quot;Taxi&quot; writer Sam Simon recalled in 2008 that during production of Simon&#x27;s first script for that show, a missing Conaway was found in his dressing room too high on drugs to perform. Conaway&#x27;s dialogue for that episode was divided between his co-stars Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd, who delivered the jokes well enough so that Conaway&#x27;s absence had little negative effect on the episode. This development caused the show&#x27;s producers to realize that Conaway was expendable and this contributed to his termination. Conaway was reported at the time to be dissatisfied with being typecast as a &quot;blond bimbo&quot; and the &quot;butt of struggling-actor jokes,&quot; along with finding the nature of the role repetitive. He also felt creatively stymied:

=== After &quot;Taxi&quot; ===
Conaway starred in the short-lived 1983 fantasy-spoof series &quot;Wizards and Warriors&quot;. He made guest appearances on such shows as &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot;, &quot;George and Leo&quot;, and &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;. He appeared in films such as &quot;Jawbreaker&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Do You Wanna Know a Secret?&quot; 

From 1989 to 1990, he played Mick Savage on &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;. In 1993, he appeared onstage in &quot;Real Life Photographs&quot;. From 1994 to 1999, he played Sergeant, later promoted to Security Chief, Zack Allan on &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. In 2010 he provided voice-over for the English version of the animated short film &quot;Dante&#x27;s Hell Animated&quot; (released in 2013), in which he is credited as &quot;Hollywood legend Jeff Conaway&quot;.

===Music career===
In addition to acting, Conaway dabbled in music. In the mid-1960s, he was the lead singer and guitarist for a rock band, The , which recorded four singles for Cameo Records in 1966 and 1967:
* &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry to Me Babe&quot; / &quot;R &amp; B In C&quot; (Cameo 425, 1966)
* &quot;Problem Child&quot; / &quot;Hey Mom Hey Dad&quot; (Cameo 442, 1966)
* &quot;Hey Gyp&quot; / &quot;Hey Kitty Cool Kitty&quot; (Cameo 451, 1967) (This single was produced by Peter Noone of Herman&#x27;s Hermits, who also wrote the B-side. The A-side is a song by Donovan.)
* &quot;Angel Baby (Don&#x27;t You Ever Leave Me)&quot; / &quot;You Turned Your Back on Love&quot; (Cameo 485, 1967)

In 1979, Conaway recorded a self-titled debut album for Columbia Records. &quot;City Boy&quot; was released as a single. Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s manager, Mike Appel, produced the album. In 2000, he released the album &quot;It Don&#x27;t Make Sense You Can&#x27;t Make Peace&quot; on the KEGMusic label.

==Personal life==
His stepson, Emerson Newton-John, is a race car driver.

===Marriages===
Conaway was married three times. His first, short-lived marriage (when he was 21) was to a dancer he had been seeing for two years. It was annulled. His second marriage, from 1980 until their divorce in 1985, was to Rona Newton-John, elder sister of his &quot;Grease&quot; co-star, Olivia Newton-John. His third marriage was to Kerri Young from 1990 to 2000.

===Health problems===
After experiencing a crisis in the mid-1980s, Conaway came to grips with having a substance abuse problem. He underwent treatment in the late 1980s and often spoke candidly about his addictions.

By the mid-2000s he had relapsed. Conaway appeared in VH1&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Fit Club&quot;, but was forced to leave and entered rehabilitation. In early 2008, Conaway appeared with other celebrities in the VH1 reality series &quot;Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew&quot;. The show revealed that Conaway was addicted to cocaine, alcohol, and painkillers, and that he was in a codependent relationship with his girlfriend, who was also a user of prescription opiates. Conaway had suffered a back injury earlier in his career on the set of &quot;Grease&quot; while filming the &quot;Greased Lightning&quot; scene, which had been exacerbated by lifting boxes in his home, and he had turned to substances to manage the pain.

Conaway&#x27;s appearance on the show&#x27;s first and second seasons drew much attention because of his severely crippled state, his constant threats to leave the facility, and his frequent inability to speak clearly. Upon arrival at the Pasadena Recovery Center (which was filmed as part of &quot;Celebrity Rehab&quot;&#x27;s first episode) Conaway, using a wheelchair, arrived drunk, mumbling to Drew Pinsky that he had binged on cocaine and Jack Daniel&#x27;s whiskey the previous night.

During the second episode of &quot;Celebrity Rehab&quot;&#x27;s first season, Conaway, fed up with his back pain, withdrawal symptoms, and the humiliation of having to be assisted while using the toilet, told Pinsky that he was thinking of killing himself. After Pinsky asked him to elaborate upon how he would carry out a suicidal act, Conaway glared at the mirror in his room and said, &quot;I see myself breaking that mirror and slicing my fucking throat with it.&quot; During group sessions, Conaway revealed he was &quot;tortured&quot; during his childhood, as older boys in his neighborhood would put him into dangerous situations, tying him up and threatening him. He also related that he was molested when he was seven years old. Conaway stated that he had been an addict since he was a teenager.

With John Travolta&#x27;s support, Conaway took courses and auditing from the Church of Scientology to cope with his drug problem and depression, although he did not intend to become a Scientologist.

In June 2009, Conaway joined &quot;Celebrity Rehab&quot; castmate Mary Carey at the premiere of her parody film &quot;Celebrity Pornhab with Dr. Screw&quot;.

In August 2009, Conaway was interviewed by &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;. In the interview, the actor claimed he was much better after a fifth back operation, and that he had yet to use painkillers again. He also discussed unscrupulous doctors and enablers.

In March 2010, shortly after the death of actor Corey Haim, Conaway told &quot;E! News&quot; that he had warned Haim about dying because of prescription drug abuse.

==Death==
On May 11, 2011, Conaway was found unconscious from what was initially described as an overdose of substances believed to be pain medication and was taken to Encino-Tarzana Regional Medical Center in Encino, California, where he was listed in critical condition. After initial reports, Drew Pinsky, who had treated Conaway for substance abuse, said the actor was suffering not from a drug overdose, but rather from pneumonia with sepsis, for which he was placed into an induced coma.

Though his drug use did not cause his pneumonia, it hampered Conaway&#x27;s ability to recognize how severely ill he was and to seek treatment for pneumonia until it was too late.

On May 26, 2011, Conaway&#x27;s family took him off life support after doctors determined they could do nothing to revive him. Conaway died the following morning at the age of 60. Conaway&#x27;s doctor attributed his death to his addiction, stating, &quot;What happens is, like with most opiate addicts, eventually they take a little too much ... and they aspirate so what&#x27;s in their mouth gets into their lungs ... That&#x27;s what happened with Jeff.&quot;

An autopsy performed on Conaway revealed that the actor died of various causes, including aspiration pneumonia and encephalopathy, attributable to drug overdoses.

<doc id="422653" wikidata="Q2777835" url="?curid=422653" title="Shooter's Hill">
<text>Shooter&#x27;s Hill is a district of South East London, England, in the Royal Borough of Greenwich bordering the London Borough of Bexley. It lies north of Eltham and south of Woolwich. With a height of , it is the highest point in the Borough of Greenwich and one of the highest points in London. Shooter&#x27;s Hill also gives its name to the road which passes through east to west, part of the A207 road, the A2 road and Watling Street.

==Geography==
It reputedly takes its name from the practice of archery there during the Middle Ages, although the name is also commonly linked to its reputation as a haunt for highwaymen and was infamous for its gibbets of executed criminals. In the Second World War it was the site of an array of anti-aircraft guns which protected London. As part of &#x27;London Stop Line Central&#x27; it was a last line of defence from a German land invasion, that was assumed would follow Watling Street from Dover. A number of devices were under the control of the Home Guard including a fougasse and a flame thrower. Adjacent to an anti-aircraft battery was built a prisoner-of-war camp on what is today part of a golf course on the north-eastern slopes. North of the golf course is Shrewsbury Park, the site for a barrage balloon, part of the Air Ministry&#x27;s Field Scheme Nosecap for the defence of London; during the Battle of Britain it was manned by 901 County of London Barrage Balloon Squadron.

Eltham Common was the site of Shooter&#x27;s Hill police station (now closed). Eltham was allegedly the only town in England with two fully functional police stations (the other in Well Hall Road), having been placed there owing to the lawlessness associated with the town.

Celia Fiennes, who in 1697 proceeded out of London along the Dover Road, wrote in her diary of stopping at:

The hill is one of the highest points in London at – offering good views over the River Thames to the north, with central London clearly visible to the west. Oxleas Wood remains a public open space close to the top of the hill; on the north side of Shooter&#x27;s Hill Road is Eaglesfield Park, Shrewsbury Park, a golf-course, and one of the last remaining areas of farmland in inner London, Woodlands Farm (now an educational charity).

&quot;Shooter&#x27;s Hill Road&quot; stretches eastwards from the heath at Blackheath up and over the hill, initially as part of the A2 road as far as the Sun in the Sands, and then the A207. The road follows the route of Watling Street, a Roman Road linking London with Roman settlements in north Kent. This was used as a route for horse-drawn mail-coaches linking London with Dover.

==Literary associations==

Byron&#x27;s Don Juan is waylaid while romantically musing on Shooter&#x27;s Hill when he first arrives in London (Canto XI). As the narrative of Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; opens, Mr Jarvis Lorry is a passenger in the Dover mail coach, &quot;lumbering up Shooter&#x27;s Hill&quot;; and Dickens refers to a public house there in &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;. The name Shooter&#x27;s Hill is also mentioned in Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot; although referring to the Hampstead area, some distance away, and also in H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; and by Thomas Carlyle. 

On 11 April 1661, diarist Samuel Pepys mentions passing under &quot;the man that hangs upon Shooter&#x27;s Hill and a filthy sight it was to see how his flesh is shrunk to his bones.&quot; (presumably a highwayman hanged and left to rot as a warning to other criminals – at &#x27;Gibbet Field&#x27;, now part of the local golf course). In the graphic novel &quot;V for Vendetta&quot; by Alan Moore and David Lloyd, the character Evey Hammond describes her childhood, spent on Shooter&#x27;s Hill.

==Landmarks==


The distinctive gothic revival water tower at the top of Shooter&#x27;s Hill is a landmark built in 1910 and can be seen from far around. Other local landmarks include Severndroog Castle, a folly designed by the architect Richard Jupp in 1784 and built to commemorate Commodore Sir William James, who on 2 April 1755 attacked and destroyed a pirate fortress at Suvarnadurg along the western coast of India.

Another water tower (of 130 ft) is further west down Shooter&#x27;s Hill. This was originally built in the 1890s to designs by Thomas W. Aldwinckle to supply water to the &#x27;Brook Fever hospital&#x27;, which was demolished in the 1990s, to be replaced by a housing development. The tower consists of a plain brick pillar ornamented simply with bands of terracotta tiles and windows like arrowslits. It is not listed, but it was cleaned, repointed and underpinned for conversion into a family home. It is the centrepiece of the housing estate.

Immediately to the east of the housing estate is the Grade II listed former Royal Herbert Hospital, today the Royal Herbert Pavilions. Further up the hill is the still-functioning Memorial Hospital.

In 1749, &#x27;The Bull&#x27; public house opened just west of the summit of the hill, and was used as a refreshment stop by the coaches, although not by the Royal Mail, which had an interchange of mail bags at the Post Office by the Red Lion on the London side of the hill.

An 18th-century grade II listed milestone in the grounds of Christ Church on Shooter&#x27;s Hill has 19th-century plates giving the distances &quot;Dartford 7 miles&quot;, &quot;London Bridge 8 miles&quot; and a later addition: &quot;130 miles to Ypres: in defending the salient our casualties were 90,000 killed, 70,500 missing, 450,000 wounded&quot;, commemorating the Battle of Ypres.
Shrewsbury Barrow is a Bronze Age burial mound which is located on the corners of Brinklow Crescent and Plum Lane, and is a scheduled monument. It is approximately 25m wide and 1.5m high. It is the last surviving burial mound out of a group of six.

==Road alterations==

During the 1950s the road gradient was lowered in the west where low-powered motor vehicles of the era frequently struggled to get to the top. As a remedy, a small section of the road west of the summit was removed and the road resurfaced from scratch to extend the slope horizontally. This alteration is evident where the road (opposite Craigholm) runs through the cutting and the pavement (following the original gradient of the hill) rises about 1–2 metres above.

* September 6 – Edmond Halley returns to England after a voyage of almost one year on HMS &quot;Paramour&quot;, from which he has observed the Antarctic Convergence, and publishes his findings on terrestrial magnetism in &quot;General Chart of the Variation of the Compass&quot;.

==Geology==
* January 26 – At approximately 9 p.m., the Cascadia earthquake occurs in the Pacific Northwest with an estimated moment magnitude of 8.7–9.2. This megathrust earthquake ruptures about of the Cascadia Subduction Zone and causes a tsunami that strikes the coast of Japan approximately 10 hours later.

==Medicine==
* Nicolas Andry publishes &quot;De la génération des vers dans les corps de l&#x27;homme&quot;, a pioneering text in the germ theory of disease.
* Bernardino Ramazzini publishes &quot;De Morbis Artificum Diatriba&quot; in Modena, a pioneering text in occupational medicine.

==Technology==
* &quot;approx. date&quot; – The clarinet might have been invented by the German flute maker Joseph Mamadski as a modification of the chalumeau, but it will not be until the late 18th century that composers include clarinets into their orchestrations.
* The piano, newly invented by Bartolomeo Cristofori, is listed in an inventory of musical instruments owned by the Medici.

==Institutions==
* July 11 – The Prussian Academy of Sciences is founded with Leibniz as president.

* February 8 – Daniel Bernoulli, Swiss mathematician (died 1782)
* May 7 – Gerard van Swieten, Dutch-born physician (died 1772)
* November 19 – Jean-Antoine Nollet, French clergyman and physicist (died 1770)
* November 28 – Nathaniel Bliss, English astronomer (died 1764)
* Undated
** William Braikenridge, Scottish clergyman and geometer (died 1762)
** George Martine, Scottish physician and scientist (died 1741)

==Deaths==
* May 22 – Louis Jolliet, Canadian explorer (born 1645)
* June 1 – Willem ten Rhijne, Dutch doctor and botanist (born 1647)

<text>Peter Jurasik ( ; born April 25, 1950) is an American actor known for his television roles as Londo Mollari in the 1990s science fiction series &quot;Babylon 5&quot; and Sid the Snitch on the 1980s series &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; and its short-lived spinoff &quot;Beverly Hills Buntz&quot;. Peter Jurasik also portrayed Oberon Geiger, Diana&#x27;s boss, in the T.V. series &quot;Sliders&quot;.

==Personal life==
Jurasik was born in Queens, New York. He is the third of four children. He attended the University of New Hampshire, where he appeared in several plays. He lives with his wife and son in Wilmington, North Carolina, and teaches acting for the camera in the Theatre Department and the Film Studies Department at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington.

==Career==
===Acting===
Jurasik is best known for playing Londo Mollari on &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. He has guest-starred as an ornithologist in one episode of &quot;MacGyver&quot;, CID investigator Captain Triplett in two episodes of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, and Dr. Oberon Geiger on three episodes of &quot;Sliders&quot;. Jurasik starred as Mitch Kline in the short-lived 1983 CBS series &quot;Bay City Blues&quot; and as Dr. Simon Ward in an episode of &quot;Columbo&quot;: &quot;Sex and the Married Detective&quot; in 1989. He also had a long-running occasional role on &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; as &quot;Sid the Snitch&quot; which became semi-regular in the last two seasons. At the conclusion of that series, his and co-star Dennis Franz&#x27;s characters were spun off into the short-lived series &quot;Beverly Hills Buntz&quot;. In 1985, Jurasik co-starred with Michael Keaton and Clint Howard in the Keaton-produced short film &quot;But I&#x27;m Happy&quot; which aired on NBC as part of David Letterman&#x27;s &#x27;Holiday Film Festival&#x27;. His film roles include Crom in the film &quot;Tron&quot; (1982), with future &quot;Babylon 5&quot; co-star Bruce Boxleitner, and as Roy, the perfect father neighbor, in &quot;Problem Child&quot; (1990). In 2000, Jurasik appeared in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio adventure &quot;Winter for the Adept&quot;.

===Writing===
In 1998, he wrote &quot;Diplomatic Act&quot; () with William H. Keith, Jr., a science fiction novel wherein the lead character, an actor in a science fiction show, is kidnapped by aliens who think he is the character from the program. The book is similar in tone and story to &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot;, which was released one year later.

<text>The &quot;Sporting News&quot; Reliever of the Year Award was an annual award presented to the best relief pitcher in each league in Major League Baseball (MLB). It was established in by &quot;The Sporting News&quot; (TSN) as the Fireman of the Year Award. At the time, no reliever had ever received a Cy Young Award vote. The Fireman of the Year Award originally recognized the reliever with the most combined saves and wins in each league in MLB. The magazine had started publishing the then-unofficial save statistic that same year. Later, a save was worth two points compared to one for a win in determining the winner. In the award was chosen based on consensus from TSN editors, and it was renamed to Reliever of the Year Award. The award was last issued in 2010 before being discontinued.

<text>The Gettysburg Battlefield is the area of the July 1–3, 1863, military engagements of the Battle of Gettysburg in and around Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Locations of military engagements extend from the site of the first shot at Knoxlyn Ridge on the west of the borough, to East Cavalry Field on the east. A military engagement prior to the battle was conducted at the Gettysburg Railroad trestle over Rock Creek, which was burned on June 27.

==Geography==
Within of the Maryland/Pennsylvania state line, the Gettysburg battlefield is situated in the Gettysburg-Newark Basin of the Pennsylvania Piedmont entirely within the Potomac River Watershed near the Marsh and Rock creeks&#x27; triple point, with the Susquehanna River Watershed (near Oak Hill) occupying an area . Military engagements occurred within and around the borough of Gettysburg (1863 pop. 2,400), which remains the population center for the battlefield area at the intersections of roads that connect the borough with 10 nearby Pennsylvania and Maryland towns (e.g., antebellum turnpikes to Chambersburg, York, and Baltimore.)


===Topography===
The battle began on the west at Lohr&#x27;s, Whistler&#x27;s, School-House, and Knoxlyn ridges between Cashtown and Gettysburg. Nearer to Gettysburg, dismounted Union cavalry defended McPherson&#x27;s Ridge and Herr&#x27;s Ridge, and eventually infantry support arrived to defend Seminary Ridge at the borough&#x27;s west side. Oak Ridge, a northward extension of both McPherson Ridge and Seminary Ridge, is capped by Oak Hill, a site for artillery that commanded a good area north of the town. Prior to Pickett&#x27;s Charge, &quot;159 guns stretching in a long line from the Peach Orchard to Oak Hill were to open simultaneously&quot;.

Directly south of the town is the gently-sloped Cemetery Hill named for the 1854 Evergreen Cemetery on its crest and where the 1863 Gettysburg Address dedicated the Gettysburg National Cemetery. Eastward are Culp&#x27;s Hill and Steven&#x27;s Knoll. Cemetery Hill and Culp&#x27;s Hill were subjected to assaults throughout the battle by Richard S. Ewell&#x27;s Second Corps. Cemetery Ridge extends about south from Cemetery Hill.

Southward from Cemetery Hill is Cemetery Ridge of only about 40 feet (12 m) above the surrounding terrain. The ridge includes The Angle&#x27;s stone wall and the copse of trees at the High-water mark of the Confederacy during Pickett&#x27;s Charge. The southern end of Cemetery Ridge is Weikert Hill, north of Little Round Top.

The two highest battlefield points are at Round Top to the south with the higher round summit of Big Round Top, the lower oval summit of Little Round Top, and a saddle between. The Round Tops are rugged and strewn with large boulders; as is Devil&#x27;s Den to the west. [Big] Round Top, known also to locals of the time as Sugar Loaf, is higher than its Little companion. Its steep slopes are heavily wooded, which made it unsuitable for siting artillery without a large effort to climb the heights with horse-drawn guns and clear lines of fire; Little Round Top was unwooded, but its steep and rocky form made it difficult to deploy artillery in mass. However, Cemetery Hill was an excellent site for artillery, commanding all of the Union lines on Cemetery Ridge and the approaches to them. Little Round Top and Devil&#x27;s Den were key locations for General John Bell Hood&#x27;s division in Longstreet&#x27;s assault during the second day of battle, July 2, 1863. The Plum Run Valley between Houck&#x27;s Ridge and the Round Tops earned the name &quot;Valley of Death&quot; on that day.

===Borough areas of military engagements===
The area of the military engagements during the battle included the majority of the 1863 town area and the current borough area. The broadest regions of borough military engagements are the combat area of the Union retreat while being pursued on July 1, as well as the burg&#x27;s area over which artillery rounds were fired. Confederate artillery fired from Oak Hill southeastward onto the retreated Union line extending east-to-west from Culp&#x27;s Hill to the west side of Cemetery Hill, and Union artillery on Cemetery Hill fired on the railway cut (including Wiedrich&#x27;s battery ~5 pm). Smaller engagements in the town included those with some federals remaining in/near structures after the retreat (e.g., wounded soldiers not willing to surrender). The largest engagement within the current borough was at Coster Avenue (north of the 1863 town) in which Early&#x27;s division defeated Coster&#x27;s brigade. The town was generally held by the Confederate provost and used by snipers after the dawn of July 2 (e.g., a brickyard behind the McCreary House, the John Rupp Tannery on Baltimore St, and a church belfry). A Confederate skirmish line at Breckenridge Street faced Federals on Cemetery Hill, and ~7 pm July 1, &quot;the Confederate line of battle had been formed on East and West Middle Streets&quot;.

==History==

At the close of the battle, some of the ~22,000 wounded remained on the battlefield and were subsequently treated at the outlying Camp Letterman hospital or nearby field hospitals, houses, churches, and other buildings. Dead soldiers on the battlefield totaled 8,900; and contractors such as David Warren were hired to bury men and animals (the majority near where they fell). Samuel Weaver oversaw all of these reburials. The first excursion train arrived with battlefield visitors on July 5.

On July 10, Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Curtin visited Gettysburg and expressed the state&#x27;s interest in finding the fallen veterans a resting place. Attorney David Wills arranged for the purchase of of Cemetery Hill battlefield land for a cemetery. On August 14, 1863, attorney David McConaughy recommended a preservation association to sell membership stock for battlefield fundraising. By September 16, 1863, battlefield protection had begun with McConaughy&#x27;s purchase of &quot;the heights of Cemetery Hill and&quot; Little Round Top, and his total purchased area of included Culp&#x27;s Hill land.

On November 19, 1863, Abraham Lincoln delivered his Gettysburg Address at the dedication of the Soldiers&#x27; National Cemetery, which was completed in March 1864 with the last of 3,512 Union reburied. From 1870 to 1873, upon the initiative of the Ladies Memorial Associations of Richmond, Raleigh, Savannah, and Charleston, 3,320 bodies were disinterred and sent to cemeteries in those cities for reburial, 2,935 being interred in Hollywood Cemetery, Richmond. Seventy-three bodies were reburied in home cemeteries. The cemetery was transferred to the United States government May 1872, and the last Battle of Gettysburg body was reburied in the national cemetery after being discovered in 1997.

Union Gettysburg veteran Emmor Cope was detailed to annotate the battlefield&#x27;s troop positions and his &quot;Map of the Battlefield of Gettysburg from the original survey made August to October, 1863&quot; was displayed at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition. Also in 1863, John B. Bachelder escorted convalescing officers at Gettysburg to identify battlefield locations (during the next winter he interviewed Union officers about Gettysburg).

===Memorial association era===
The 1864 Gettysburg Battlefield Memorial Association (GBMA) added to McConaughy&#x27;s land holdings and operated a wooden observation tower on East Cemetery Hill from 1878 to 1895. Post-war, John Bachelder invited over 1,000 officers, including 49 generals, to revisit the field with him. Bachelder also produced a battlefield survey with 1880 federal funds (initiated by Senator Wade Hampton III, a Confederate general). The GBMA approved and disapproved various monuments and in 1888 planted trees at Zeigler&#x27;s Grove. The 1st battlefield monument was an 1867 marble urn in the National Cemetery dedicated to the 1st Minnesota Infantry, and the 1st memorial outside of the cemetery was the 1878 Strong Vincent tablet on Little Round Top. By May 1887 there were 90 regimental and battery monuments on the battlefield, and the first bronze monument on the battlefield was Reynolds&#x27; 1872 statue in the cemetery. The only two Confederate monuments inside the Union areas of battle held are an 1887 plaque near The Angle commemorating Gen Armistead&#x27;s farthest advance on July 3 and the 1884 2nd Maryland Infantry monument on Culp&#x27;s Hill.

The battlefield was used by the 1884 Camp Gettysburg and other summer encampments of the PA National Guard. Commercial development in the 19th century included the 1884 Round Top Branch of railroad to Round Top, Pennsylvania, and after March 1892, Tipton Park operated in the Slaughter Pen—which was at a trolley station of the Gettysburg Electric Railway that operated from 1894 to 1916.

The federal Gettysburg National Park Commission was established on March 3, 1893; after which Congressman Daniel Sickles initiated a May 31, 1894, resolution “&quot;to acquire by purchase (or by condemnation) … such lands, or interests in lands, upon or in the vicinity of said battle field&quot;. The memorial association era ended in 1895 when the &quot;Sickles Gettysburg Park Bill&quot; (28 Stat. 651) designated the Gettysburg National Military Park (GNMP) under the War Department. Subsequent battlefield improvements included the October 1895 construction of the War Department&#x27;s observation towers to replace the 1878 Cemetery Hill tower and an 1881 Big Round Top tower.

===Commemorative era===
:See also List of monuments of the Gettysburg Battlefield
For payment of the Gettysburg Battlefield Memorial Association&#x27;s debts of $1960.46, on February 4, 1896, the War Department acquired 124 GBMA tracts totaling , including 320 monuments and about of roads. Commercial development after Tipton Park was abolished in the fall of 1901 included the July 1902 Hudson Park picnic grove north of Little Round Top (including a boxing arena). A dancing pavilion was erected at the Round Top Museum in 1902, and in the saddle area between the Round Tops, David Weikert operated an eating house moved from Tipton Park after it was seized in 1901 by eminent domain. Landscape preservation began in 1883 when peach trees were planted in the Peach Orchard, and 20,000 battlefield trees were planted in 1906 (trees are periodically removed from battlefield areas that had been logged prior to the battle.)

Battlefield visitors through the early 20th century typically arrived by train at the borough&#x27;s 1884 Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg RR Station or the 1859 Gettysburg Railroad Station and used horse-drawn jitneys to tour the battlefield. The borough licensed automobile taxis first in 1913, and the War Department expanded the battlefield roads throughout the commemorative era. Early 20th century battlefield excursions included those by &quot;The Hod Carriers Consolidated Union of Baltimore&quot; and the annual &quot;Topton Day&quot; autumn foliage tours from near Berks County, Pennsylvania.

Veterans reunions included the 1888 25th battle anniversary, a 1906 ceremony to return Gen Armistead&#x27;s sword to the South. and 53,407 civil war veterans attending the 1913 Gettysburg reunion for the 50th anniversary. The battlefield had a 1912 airfield at Camp Stuart and a WWI Tank Corps center at Brevet Lt. Col. Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s 1918 Camp Colt, and excursions to the Round Top Park brought alcohol and prostitution. The 1922 Camp Harding included a Marine Corps reenactment of Pickett&#x27;s Charge observed by President Warren Harding and a next-day simulation of the same attack with modern weapons and tactics.

The battlefield&#x27;s commemorative era ended in 1927, and use of the national park for military camps continued under an 1896 federal law (29 Stat. 120), e.g., a 1928 artillery and cavalry camp was held at Culp&#x27;s Hill in conjunction with President Calvin Coolidge&#x27;s Memorial Day address in the cemetery&#x27;s rostrum.

===Development era===

In 1933, administration of the GNMP transferred to the 1916 National Park Service (NPS), which initiated Great Depression projects including 1933 Civil Works Administration improvements, and two Civilian Conservation Corps camps were subsequently built for battlefield maintenance and construction projects. After a 1933 comfort station had been built at The Pennsylvania State Memorial, similar stone Parkitecture structures were built (the west ranger station was completed May 21, 1937), and in April 1938, the Works Progress Administration added battlefield parking areas. Numerous commercial facilities were also developed on private battlefield land, particularly during the 1950s &quot;Golden Age of Capitalism&quot; in the United States (e.g., motels, eateries, &amp; visitor attractions).

The battlefield&#x27;s 2nd largest monument, the Eternal Light Peace Memorial, was accepted by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and unveiled at the 1938 Gettysburg reunion that attracted over 300,000 battlefield visitors. In 1939, the 1st of the Gettysburg National Museum&#x27;s 14 expansions was completed (the electric map auditorium was added in 1963 and closed April 13, 2008). Pitzer Woods was the site of the World War II Camp Sharpe, and McMillan Woods had a German POW camp (the latter was used for post-war housing of migrant workers for local production). Heads-of-state at the battlefield included a 1943 Winston Churchill auto tour with President Roosevelt, President Eisenhower escorting President Charles De Gaulle (1960), and President Jimmy Carter hosting President Anwar Sadat and Prime Minister Menachem Begin (1978).

The 1956 Mission 66 plan for the 1966 NPS 50th anniversary included restoring battlefield houses, resurfacing of avenues, replacing the railway cut bridge, and restoring the 1884 Gettysburg Cyclorama.

===1962–present===
As the Mission 66 Cyclorama Building at Gettysburg with a new battlefield observation deck was being completed in 1962, the nearby 1896 Zeigler&#x27;s Grove observation tower was removed (the 1895 Big Round Top observation tower was removed in 1968). In 1967, the NPS purchased the 1921 Gettysburg National Museum, which the NPS operated from 1971-2008. Also in 1971, the NPS acquired Round Top Station and the Round Top Museum, using the latter as an environmental resource center until demolished 1982. The private Gettysburg National Tower of was completed in 1974 to provide several observation levels for viewing the battlefield, but was purchased under eminent domain and demolished in 2000. In the Devil&#x27;s Den area, trees were removed in 2007, and the comfort station was razed April 8, 2010. Similarly, the Gettysburg National Museum was demolished in 2008.

In 2008, the Gettysburg National Military Park had 1,320 monuments, 410 cannon, 148 historic buildings, 2½ observation towers, and of avenues, roads, and lanes; (8 unpaved). &quot;one of the largest collections of outdoor sculpture in the world.&quot;

In February 2013 the landmark modernist Cyclorama Building and Visitor Center, designed by renowned architect Richard Neutra, was destroyed. The 19th century Gettysburg Cyclorama depicting the battlefield had previously been removed for restoration, and was reinstalled in the new rustic style Gettysburg Museum and Visitor Center.

The Gettysburg National Military Park receives an annual 3 million visitors per year.

The American Battlefield Trust and its partners have acquired and preserved of the overall battlefield in more than 35 separate transactions since 1997. Some of the land has been sold or conveyed to the National Park Service to be incorporated into the national park, but other land acquisitions are outside the official, federally established, current park boundary and thus cannot become part of the park. This includes the headquarters of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, one of the Trust&#x27;s most significant and expensive acquisitions. In 2015, the Trust paid $6 million for a four-acre parcel that included the stone house that Lee used as his headquarters during the battle. The Trust razed a motel, restaurant and other buildings within the parcel to restore the site to its wartime appearance, added interpretive signs and opened the site to the public in October, 2016.

<doc id="422678" wikidata="Q644917" url="?curid=422678" title="Rozz Williams">
<text>Rozz Williams (born Roger Alan Painter; November 6, 1963 – April 1, 1998) was an American singer and songwriter known for his work with the bands Christian Death, Shadow Project (with musician Eva O), and the industrial project Premature Ejaculation. Christian Death is cited by some as a pioneer of the American gothic rock scene as well as deathrock, and is considered to be one of the most influential figures of the scene. However, Williams disliked the &quot;goth&quot; label and actively worked to shed it during the 1980s and 1990s by focusing on punk rock, hard rock, cabaret, and spoken word music. Williams was also involved with his groups Daucus Karota, Heltir, EXP, Bloodflag, and his own version of Christian Death (Christian Death featuring Rozz Williams), along with recording a handful of solo albums. In addition to music, Williams was also an avid painter, poet, and collage artist.

Williams committed suicide by hanging himself in his West Hollywood apartment on April 1, 1998. He was 34 years old.

== Early life==
Rozz Williams was born Roger Alan Painter on November 6, 1963, in Pomona, California, and was raised in a strict Southern Baptist family. His father Robert Norman Painter was an artist. Rozz had three older siblings (Janet, Bobby, and Larry). After being expelled from his high school in Pomona for lack of attendance, he transferred to Claremont High School, where he was again expelled in ninth grade.

As a child, he was a fan of David Bowie, Lou Reed, Roxy Music, T. Rex, Alice Cooper, Iggy Pop and the New York Dolls.

== Career ==
=== Early bands ===
At the age of fifteen, Painter formed his first band the A-Sexuals. In an interview with Nico B, Jill Emery stated of the A-Sexuals: &quot;I thought it was funny because considering we were kind of coming out of the closet to a degree and we were, and in my mind later in life, like even last year, why can&#x27;t the asexuals – and I don&#x27;t mean the band; I mean in general — be in the gay parade too? Why can&#x27;t they be in the back of it? Like, they are people too, and they have their preference, but it&#x27;s just funny. We were just kids. We weren&#x27;t that straight edge&quot;. In addition to being the lead vocalist, he played the organ and guitar, with Jill Emery also contributing vocals as well as playing bass, and Steve Darrow on drums. The A-Sexuals disbanded after a few months, with Emery and Darrow morphing the band into the Decadents at the end of 1978.

Following this, Painter became friends with John &quot;Jay&quot; Albert, with whom he would attempt to form several bands with under names including No and the Crawlers. These groups never performed live and most rarely even rehearsed. In Mikey Bean&#x27;s book &quot;Phantoms&quot;, Albert called them &quot;nonexistent band[s]&quot;. Around this time, Painter began an intimate relationship with Darby Crash, vocalist of the Germs, under whose influence he decided to take a stage name. There exists an urban myth that the name &quot;Rozz Williams&quot; was derived from a gravestone in Pemona, however in &quot;Phantoms&quot;, Albert, Darrow and George Belanger claim that this is untrue, with Belanger stating that the first name came as a suggestion from their friend Ann Miller.

=== Christian Death ===

Albert and Williams formed Christian Death in October 1979 alongside bassist James McGearty and drummer George Belanger. At this time, the band was a punk rock band musically indebted to the Germs. As the band progressed their music slowed and began to incorporate religious symbolism. Their first live performance was an impromptu set at the Hong Kong Cafe in Los Angeles supporting Castration Squad, replacing Killer Pussy after they were booed off stage.

After a physical altercation involving Belanger took place, he was left unable to play drums for their upcoming at on February 14, 1981. Williams asked Steve Darrow to fill in, however Belanger decided moments before their set to still try and play, leading to Belanger performing the first few songs then Darrow finishing the set. This incident angered Albert, who left the band permanently mid-set. Subsequently, Christian Death was halted, with Albert and Williams forming noise band Daucus Karota with drummer Mary Torcivia. Williams, McGearty and Belanger regrouped a few months later, now accompanied by guitarist Rikk Agnew, who had just left the Adolescents. With this lineup, they made their first vinyl appearance with the song &quot;Dogs&quot; on the 1981 L.A. scene compilation album &quot;Hell Comes to Your House&quot;. The following year, they signed with Frontier Records and released their debut studio album, &quot;Only Theatre of Pain&quot;, on March 24.

The following year Belanger left the band after becoming disheartened by the growing darkness of the band&#x27;s image and increasing drug abuse. Belanger&#x27;s role was filled by Rod &quot;China&quot; Figueroa, whose first performance with the band was a record signing on April 10, 1982. Later that year, while the band were getting ready for a domestic tour, Agnew, distressed by his own drug use and troubles in his relationship, began to experience panicked episodes where he would imagine Williams and his boyfriend Ron Athey being subject to homophobic attacks in Southern states and the band being arrested for drug possession. This culminated in him leaving the band as they were preparing to go on stage. The band then hired Mikaleno Amundson to play guitar, who moved in with Figueroa. However, when Amundson and Figueroas&#x27; girlfriends fell out with each other, Amundson was forced to move out and leave the band after &quot;about three to five shows.&quot; Because of this, Eva O briefly became the band&#x27;s guitarist. On October 30, 1982, this lineup opened for Angelic Upstarts at SIR Studios alongside Pompeii 99. Following this, Michael Montano and Johnnie Sage both began playing guitar in the band, and they played again with Pompeii 99. By the end of the year, McGearty had left the band. With Williams as the only founding member remaining, Christian Death disbanded.

Around this point, Pompeii 99 too were going through a number of lineup changes. Subsequently, six months after Christian Death&#x27;s disbandment, Williams joined Pompeii 99, which at that time consisted of only guitarist and vocalist Valor Kand and drummer David &quot;Glass&quot; Parkinson. Under Williams&#x27; suggestion, the band&#x27;s session keyboard player and Kand&#x27;s partner Gitane DeMone officially joined the band. After Williams was approached by Yann Farcy of French record label L&#x27;Invitation au Suicide to record another Christian Death album and tour Europe, the band hired bassist Constance Smith (later Redgrave) and changed their name to Christian Death. This culminated in Christian Death&#x27;s second studio album &quot;Catastrophe Ballet&quot; (1984). Recorded at Rockfield studios in Monmouth, Wales, much of this album&#x27;s instrumentals were written by Kand, with Williams contributing entirely to lyrics and partially to melody writing. It was a departure the band&#x27;s angry punk influenced style and was dedicated to surrealist André Breton. While in France, Smith departed from the group due to a mental health struggle, being replaced by Dave Roberts of Sex Gang Children.

In autumn 1984 the band returned to America and recorded &quot;Ashes&quot;, which was released the following year. In mid-1985, Williams departed from the group, frustrated by Kand&#x27;s increasing control of the band and perceived disregard for how touring affected the members&#x27; ventures outside of music. He originally planned to do this under the pretext that DeMone would also be leaving, however she soon decided not to, as that would also mean separating Kand from their child together. Following Williams&#x27; departure, the remaining members made an effort to change the band&#x27;s name to Sin and Sacrifice, transitioning to that name through booking their next tour as the Sin and Sacrifice of Christian Death. However, the promoters did not adhere to this change, instead having them booked as simply Christian Death. This issue then became exacerbated once they were offered a record deal which they could only accept if they continued on as Christian Death.

Williams recorded for Cleopatra Records in 1992. Williams had been the only original member of Christian Death left when he departed the group in 1985, yet the remaining members continued to perform earlier Christian Death material and released several albums under the original group name.

Williams had already recorded two more songs, &quot;Haloes&quot; and &quot;Spectre (Love Is Dead)&quot;, with Eric Westfall, but these were not officially released for five years. The songs appeared on the &quot;Heavens and Hells&quot; cassettes, which also included live performances Williams selected from his own tapes. A third, unfinished song from the session with Eric Westfall was called &quot;This Mirage&quot;. This was only completed many years after, with assistance from Erik Christides, and released for the first time in 1998.

=== Premature Ejaculation, Shadow Project and Christian Death featuring Rozz Williams ===

Williams formed Premature Ejaculation in 1981 with performance artist Ron Athey. After only a few live performances, including one which involved Athey eating a crucified road-kill cat, clubs began refusing to book them.

Williams formed Shadow Project with Eva O in 1987, The band lineup included Johann Schumann (bass) and also Barry Galvin and David Glass, both of whom also recorded with post &quot;Ashes&quot;-era Christian Death. The name &quot;Shadow Project&quot; was taken from the tests in Hiroshima following the nuclear bomb which left impressions or &quot;shadows&quot;, but no bodies.

Later on, Williams reformed Shadow Project with Eva O, Jill Emery (bass), Tom Morgan (drums) and Paris Sadonis (keyboards). At the time, Rozz was increasingly falling under the influence of the philosophy of Charles Manson. Jill Emery left the band early in 1992 to concentrate her duties on Hole, who would become an internationally successful act, and Aaron Schwartz was brought in to record &quot;Dead Babies/Killer&quot; for the &quot;Welcome to Our Nightmare&quot; compilation CD consisting of cover versions of Alice Cooper songs. Chuck Collison also contributed samples to these tracks.

Williams, Eva, Listo (bass) and David Melford (drums) started recording new versions of Christian Death songs for &quot;The Iron Mask&quot; album in February 1992. The album was made, in part, to finance the Shadow Project European tour of February and March 1992, when they were supported by Mephisto Walz. Peter Tomlinson had replaced Tom Morgan on drums for this tour.

Williams also occasionally took part in Christian Death reunions during the late 1980s and early 1990s with Rikk Agnew, the guitarist on the band&#x27;s first album.

In 1992, with the help of Eva O, Paris Sadonis, William Faith, Sevan Kand (son of Valor Kand), Scat Elis, Stevyn Grey, Kris Kohls, Brian Virtue, Wayne James, Armon Christoff and Aaron Schwartz, Rozz Williams recorded two new Christian Death studio albums entitled &quot;The Path of Sorrows&quot; and &quot;The Rage of Angels&quot;. Williams had been quoted as saying &quot;&quot;The Path of Sorrows&quot; is probably my favorite Christian Death album&quot;.

For the last time in June 1993 at Los Angeles&#x27; Patriotic Hall, Christian Death regrouped for a one show, captured on the CD and live video &quot;Iconologia&quot;. Williams was joined by Rikk Agnew, George Belanger and Casey (bass). Following his brother&#x27;s decision not to come back on stage to play the encores, Frank Agnew was credited as additional guitarist on the recordings. During some live performances, Williams could be seen wearing a T-shirt which sported the words &quot;Never Trust a Valor&quot;.

At this time, there were effectively two bands recording and performing material under the name &quot;Christian Death&quot;. This eventually precipitated a heated legal battle between Williams and Valor Kand which was never satisfactorily resolved.

In 1993, Shadow Project toured America. The band consisted of Williams, Eva, Paris Sadonis, Mark Barone (bass) and Christian Omar Madrigal Izzo (drums). After this American tour, Eva O and Paris left the band to work on the Eva O Halo Experience CD &quot;Demons Fall for an Angel&#x27;s Kiss&quot;. Shadow Project had come to an end; however, a German tour for October had already been booked. Although all tickets, flyers and publicity for this tour were credited to Shadow Project, Williams had decided that the band name should change to Daucus Karota. He sang on the tour, Brian Butler was the guitarist, Mark Barone played bass and Christian Omar Madrigal Izzo was on drums. For one show, Demone drove from her home in Amsterdam to Germany to meet up with Williams backstage. The &quot;Shrine&quot; EP by Daucus Karota was recorded in January 1994 with Mark Barone (bass), Christian Omar Madrigal Izzo (drums) and Roxy (guitars). The EP was reviewed favourably by &quot;Trouser Press&quot;. Daucus Karota returned to Europe for a month-long European tour in November 1994, with Demone filling the support slot. The tour had Todd Dixon on drums, Michael Saavedra on bass and Brian Hansen on guitar. Hansen had replaced Rolf Donath, who had been the guitarist for the band at shows in Los Angeles and Mexico during that summer.

=== Later career ===
Demone and Williams came together to release the album &quot;Dream Home Heartache&quot; in 1995. It was recorded by Williams and Demone in Gent, Belgium between March 28 and April 5, 1995, with help from Pieter Rekfelt. The producer was Ken Thomas who had previously worked with David Bowie on &quot;Hunky Dory&quot;. Williams and Gitane played a few shows together in April 1995 and again in December 1995. They toured the UK in April 1996.

In 1995, following his return from Europe, Williams joined up with Paris Sadonis and Ryan Wildstar to work on the spoken word album, &quot;The Whorse&#x27;s Mouth&quot;. The lyrics, co-written with Ryan Wildstar, chronicle a period of heroin addiction from which the two eventually escaped. Shortly following the recording of &quot;The Whorse&#x27;s Mouth&quot;, Williams began playing bass for EXP, the musical troupe created by Paris and Ryan Wildstar. He went on to play bass on their self-titled debut album with bandmates Paris (keyboards), Ryan Wildstar (vocals), Doriandra (vocals), Ace Farren Ford (horns/violin), Justin Bennett (drums) and Ignacio Segovia (percussion).

In 1997, Williams again paired up with Eva O to record the final Shadow Project album, &quot;From the Heart&quot;. He also recorded &quot;Wound of Exit&quot;, his last solo CD as Premature Ejaculation.

=== Other interests ===
In addition to his musical activities, Williams had a keen interest in painting, along with collaging, and several of his pieces have been exhibited at some dark art shows through Los Angeles and Atlanta through his friend Snow Elizabeth. He also co-directed and scored &quot;Pig&quot;, a 1998 experimental psychological horror silent short film with underground film maker Nico B. The film stars Rozz Williams and James Hollan and was produced and directed by Nico B. &quot;Pig&quot; was the last work Williams did.

== Personal life ==
Williams did not like to discuss his sexual orientation publicly, however in a 1997 interview with John Sabien Ellenberger for Golgotha Magazine, he called himself gay. In the same interview with Ellenberger, while discussing &quot;The Whorse&#x27;s Mouth&quot; he revealed how he was hesitant to have his family listen to the album, Williams stated, &quot;There&#x27;s certain things I don&#x27;t feel like need to be shared with them. It was a really difficult thing for me to call, and just say like &#x27;well guess what? I&#x27;m gay&#x27;. You know, my mom&#x27;s response was &#x27;Well son, I&#x27;m not stupid.&#x27;&quot; In the 1980s, he was in a long-term relationship with performance artist Ron Athey, and together they would both enter an intimate relationship with Eva O. After Athey and Williams split, Williams would continue his relationship with Eva O, whom he married in 1987, and then divorced in 1998.

Williams regularly performed in drag, a trait that put him at an inverse to the prevailing hypermasculinity of the hardcore punk scene he was involved in. He began doing this as an act of rebellion against the jock types who became involved in punk. Music archivist Danny Fuentes compared his style of performance to political activism, stating: &quot;The gender bending of his persona and the in-your-face delivery made it a form of queer activism... that is what was brave about him, he never felt the need to explain himself.&quot; However, as time passed it became intrinsically linked to his identity; he began to explore the practice of &quot;living in drag&quot;, where for stretches of time he would only ever be seen in women&#x27;s clothes, an aspect that lessened later in life. Musician Anohni cited this aspect of Williams as influential upon both her understanding of her own identity and the style of performance in her group Blacklips, saying in an interview with &quot;Artforum&quot; that she &quot;think[s] of Rozz more and more as such a foundational presence in a certain line of underground queer dreaming. Rozz... definitely had a huge impact on me and Johanna, as did Diamanda Galás.&quot; Andrew D&#x27;Angelo too cited Williams as influential upon his understanding of gender and sexuality.

Williams was raised in a strict Southern Baptist family, but abandoned this as he formed Christian Death. As the years went on, as he stated in an interview with Ellenberger, he eventually became a Satanist and practiced magic in the privacy of his home. However, in 1996, he stated in another interview with Ellenberger that he had developed a &quot;personal relationship with God.&quot;

&quot;And What About the Bells?&quot;, a collection of Williams&#x27; poetry compiled and edited by Ryan Wildstar, was released posthumously in 2010. An updated, hardcover edition, featuring scans of Williams&#x27; journals, a new foreword, and an in-depth interview with Ryan Wildstar was released on June 9, 2023.

== Suicide ==
In the introduction for the book &quot;And What About the Bells?&quot;, Ryan Wildstar (born Ryan Gaumer), Williams&#x27; friend and roommate of eight years, stated that on March 31, the night before Williams took his own life, they watched the film &quot;Isadora&quot; (1968), about dancer Isadora Duncan, during which Wildstar retired to bed despite Williams&#x27; protest, who said, &quot;You don&#x27;t even know how it ends!&quot; Wildstar replied that he knew Isadora hangs to death at the end after her scarf gets caught on the spokes of her car&#x27;s wheel, and went to bed. Williams made final phone calls to friends and family in the early morning hours the next day. Wildstar said that if he had not been distraught over the death of his boyfriend Erik Christides, who died of a heroin overdose on November 27, 1997 (Thanksgiving Day), he would have seen the warning signs to Williams&#x27; suicide more clearly.

On April 1, 1998, Williams hanged himself in his West Hollywood apartment, at the age of 34. His body was discovered by Wildstar, who heard worried messages on the answering machine and broke down the door to Williams&#x27; bedroom when he returned home that afternoon. Williams had left a rose on the coffee table in the living room, along with several items, including The Hanged Man tarot card. He left no note. A memorial was held at the El Rey Theatre shortly after his death, and a small gathering of family and friends scattered his ashes at Runyon Canyon Park in the Hollywood Hills.

Theories have arisen regarding the reason for Williams&#x27;s suicide, including failing health, depression, bipolar disorder, financial instability, and his fascination with the number 1334, which can be found in the liner notes of his albums, in his signature, and also on his urn. It is also unknown as to why Williams committed suicide on April Fools&#x27; Day.

The cabinet in which he hanged himself as well as a few pieces of original artwork are on display at the LA Museum of Death.

== Legacy ==
Williams&#x27; creativity had a profound effect on the Goth subculture and was also influential in poetry and collage artwork. Annually, fans pay tribute to his life and work. In 2010, &quot;Gothic Beauty Magazine&quot; and a short film &quot;Necessary Discomforts an Artistic Tribute to Rozz Williams&quot; featured one such event at the Hyaena Gallery curated by A Raven Above Press.

The Mountain Goats&#x27; 2000 album, &quot;The Coroner&#x27;s Gambit&quot;, was dedicated to Williams, and several songs refer to singer John Darnielle&#x27;s reaction to Williams&#x27; death.

On April 1, 2018, to commemorate twenty years since Williams&#x27;s death, Cult Epics and Dark Vinyl Records released two albums: &quot;In the Heart&quot;, recorded during the &quot;Dream Home Heartache Tour&quot;, and &quot;On the Altar&quot;, from Williams&#x27;s last European tour.

In 2018, Cult Epics released a box set to commemorate the 20th anniversary of his film &quot;Pig&quot;, which starred Williams. Only twenty-five were made. Each included one of the few remaining VHS copies of the film (numbered up to 1334), an exclusive t-shirt, a postcard, lobby cards, a limited edition print of one of Williams&#x27; collages, a commemorative pin, and a portion of the original 8 mm film strip. Each box was signed and dated by Nico B., and each VHS tape was signed as well.

Cult Epics had released also the book &quot;The Art of Rozz Williams: From Christian Death to Death&quot; in a Hardcover re-issue in 2018 as well &quot;Christian Death: OTOP Photography by Edward Colver&quot;, in Hardcover and Softcover editions in 2022.

<text>Stephen Furst (born Stephen Nelson Feuerstein; May 8, 1954 – June 16, 2017) was an American actor. After gaining attention with his featured role as Kent &quot;Flounder&quot; Dorfman in the comedy film &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot; and its spin-off television series &quot;Delta House&quot;,
he went on to be a regular as Dr. Elliot Axelrod in the medical drama series &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; from 1983 to 1988, and as Centauri diplomatic attaché Vir Cotto in the science fiction series &quot;Babylon 5&quot; from 1994 to 1998. Other notable film roles included the college comedy &quot;Midnight Madness&quot; (1980), as a team leader in an all-night mystery game, the action thriller &quot;Silent Rage&quot; (1982), as deputy to a sheriff played by Chuck Norris, and the comedy &quot;The Dream Team&quot; (1989), as a good-natured psychiatric patient.

==Early life==
Born Stephen Nelson Feuerstein in Norfolk, Virginia, on May 8, 1954, Furst attended Virginia Commonwealth University. He was Jewish.

==Career==

===Acting===

Furst worked as a pizza delivery driver while looking for acting jobs in the mid-1970s, and included his head shot in pizza boxes. After Matty Simmons saw his photo, Furst was cast as Kent &quot;Flounder&quot; Dorfman in &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot; (1978), reprising the role in the short-lived 1979 spin-off ABC sitcom &quot;Delta House&quot;, and repeating his famous line, &quot;Oh boy, is this great!&quot;, as a school principal with a personality mirroring Flounder&#x27;s in the music video for Twisted Sister&#x27;s &quot;I Wanna Rock.&quot;

Other roles include &quot;Junior&quot; Keller (the unseen) in the 1980 horror film &quot;The Unseen&quot;, Gonzer in the 1984 feature film &quot;Up the Creek&quot;, Dr. Elliot Axelrod in the television series &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; (1983–1988), and Vir Cotto in the science fiction television series &quot;Babylon 5&quot; (1994–1998). Furst was amused by the report that North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un modeled his haircut after Furst&#x27;s character in &quot;Babylon 5&quot;.

In 1979 he starred as an overweight high school tuba player coerced onto the wrestling team in Kieth Merrill&#x27;s feel-good underdog film, &quot;Take Down&quot;. In 1980, he played the character of Harold in the film &quot;Midnight Madness&quot;. Furst appeared in 1982 in an episode of &quot;Newhart&quot; called &quot;Sprained Dreams&quot; where he played a Dartmouth College student. In 1983, he also appeared in a supporting role as Aldo in the ABC television film &quot;The Day After.&quot; In 1989, he played the character of Albert Ianuzzi in the film &quot;The Dream Team.&quot;

In 1983, Furst also appeared alongside Erik Estrada, Tom Reilly, and Heather O&#x27;Rourke in an episode of &quot;CHiPs&quot; titled &quot;Fun House&quot; as a student who belonged to the college fraternity &quot;DDT&quot;.

In the 1995 animated TV series &quot;Freakazoid!,&quot; he voiced the character Fanboy. Also in 1995, he took a hiatus from &quot;Babylon 5&quot; to star in a short-lived TV series, &quot;Misery Loves Company.&quot; In 1997, he played Derby Ferris in &quot;Little Bigfoot 2: The Journey Home&quot;. He also voiced a young Colonel Hathi in Season 2 of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Jungle Cubs&quot;, had a starring voice role as Booster in the 2000 series &quot;Buzz Lightyear of Star Command&quot; and its direct-to-video prequel &quot;Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins&quot; and also voiced a hulky walrus named Dash in the 2000 Disney film &quot;The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea&quot;. He starred in &quot;Magic Kid&quot; and its sequel.

In 2002, he guest starred in an episode of &quot;Scrubs&quot;. In the same year, he was cast as Walter Nichols in the unaired pilot of the Nickelodeon television series &quot;Drake &amp; Josh&quot;, but his identity was unknown in visuals, until his name was revealed in a YouTube video from 2017. He was replaced by Jonathan Goldstein prior to the series&#x27; debut, due to his unavailability for future episodes.

===Directing and producing===
Furst began directing with three episodes of &quot;Babylon 5&quot;; two in the fourth season and one in the fifth. Furst directed many independent and low-budget films, including the 2001 film &quot;Title to Murder&quot;, starring Christopher Atkins and Maureen McCormick, and the direct-to-video children&#x27;s film &quot;Baby Huey&#x27;s Great Easter Adventure&quot;. He also directed three low-budget films for the Sci Fi Channel: &quot;Dragon Storm&quot; in 2004, &quot;Path of Destruction&quot; in 2005, and &quot;Basilisk: The Serpent King&quot; in 2006; he also co-starred in the last two films.

Furst produced &quot;My Sister&#x27;s Keeper&quot;, based on the Jodi Picoult novel, starring Cameron Diaz and Alec Baldwin. He produced several other films under his production company Curmudgeon Films. &quot;Atomic Shark&quot; aired in August 2016 on Syfy, during &quot;Sharknado Week&quot;. &quot;Christmas in Homestead&quot; premiered on the Hallmark Channel during the holiday season of 2016. &quot;Cold Moon&quot;, a psychological thriller based on the Michael McDowell book, is set for a theatrical release in October 2017 in the United States. &quot;Cold Moon&quot; won &quot;Best Horror Film&quot; at the 2016 Laughlin Film Festival.

==Personal life==
Furst was married to entertainment lawyer Lorraine Wright from 1976 until his death. The couple had two sons, both of whom are in the entertainment business. His older son Nathan (born 1978) is a television and film composer, while his younger son Griff (born 1981) is an actor, director and musician.
Both of Furst&#x27;s parents died from complications of diabetes. Shortly after his father&#x27;s death, Furst was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at age 17. He reached a weight of 320 pounds and had uncontrolled type 2 diabetes by the age of 40. After almost needing to have his left foot amputated due to diabetes complications in 1996, Furst reduced his weight from 260 lbs to 175 lbs.

Starting in June 2006, Furst co-hosted the Renal Support Network&#x27;s webcast &quot;KidneyTalk&quot; with Lori Hartwell. He became a spokesperson for the American Diabetes Association and authored the book &quot;Confessions of a Couch Potato&quot;. As a celebrity spokesperson for the American Heart Association, Furst said, &quot;I thought I was more powerful than the disease of diabetes, but in reality, I was letting it take control of me. Now, I&#x27;ve decided to take control of my life.&quot;

=== 2016 criticism of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences===
Furst wrote a letter, later published in &quot;Variety&quot;, criticizing the Academy&#x27;s portrayal of its members as racist and resistant to diversity and suggested the Academy&#x27;s response to the 2016 #OscarsSoWhite was ageist and sexist. He suggested that most members of the Academy do not watch the films nominated for awards, and that the Academy should start by ensuring those who vote have watched the films.

==Death==
On June 16, 2017, Furst died from complications related to diabetes at his home in Moorpark, California, at the age of 63.

<text>David Lee Gallagher (born February 9, 1985) is an American actor and former model. He began his career as a child actor and model at the age of two, and is known for his roles as Mikey Ubriacco in &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking Now&quot;, Simon Camden in &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, Kevin Harper in &quot;Angels in the Endzone&quot;, Richie Rich in &quot;Richie Rich&#x27;s Christmas Wish&quot;, and Riku in the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series. Throughout his career, he has been a five-time Young Artist Award nominee and Teen Choice Award winner. 

==Early life==
Gallagher was born in New York City to Elena Gallagher (née Lopez) and Darren James Gallagher. After they separated when he was a baby, his mother remarried Vincent Casey. Gallagher is of Cuban descent on his mother&#x27;s side and Irish descent on his father&#x27;s side. He has four younger siblings, two brothers and two sisters. After his brother Killian was diagnosed with autism at the age of three, he became a supporter and spokesperson for Autism Speaks.

He graduated from Chaminade College Preparatory School (California) in 2003 and enrolled at the University of Southern California, where he majored in film and television studies, graduating in May 2007.

==Career==
Gallagher began acting at the age of two, modeling for print advertorials in and around New York City, which eventually led to commercial work as an actor. As a toddler, he appeared in several television commercials for products such as Tyson Foods and Fisher-Price. When he was eight years old, he had a recurring role on the soap opera &quot;Loving&quot;.

He made his film debut in 1993 portraying Mikey Ubriacco in the film &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking Now!&quot;, and in 1995 was part of a production of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; on Broadway. He also starred in several television film, including &quot;Bermuda Triangle&quot;.

Later that year, he was cast as Simon Camden in &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, which aired for eleven seasons, making it the longest-running family drama on television, and became the highest-rated show on The WB.

During hiatuses from filming, he appeared in several films, including the direct-to-video &quot;Richie Rich&#x27;s Christmas Wish&quot; and &quot;Little Secrets&quot; with Evan Rachel Wood. In 2003, during &quot;7th Heaven&quot;″s eighth season, Gallagher left the show to attend college full-time. However, he returned to the series part-time during the ninth season and the tenth season, which was thought to be the final season. In late 2006, The CW unexpectedly picked up the show for an eleventh season, but Gallagher chose not to renew his contract. In 2005, Gallagher starred in and co-produced a low-budget adaptation of &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;.

After leaving &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, he had several roles, including serial killer Buck Winters in &quot;Numb3rs&quot;, a murder suspect in the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;Dangerous Son&quot;, Mark in &quot;Boogeyman 2&quot;, Paul Shapiro in&quot; Saving Grace&quot;, Ryan Stephenson in &quot;Bones&quot;, Jeff Ellis in &quot;Without a Trace&quot;, Seiji Amasawa in the English dub of &quot;Whisper of the Heart&quot;, and Kevin Mather in &quot;The Deep End&quot; episode &quot;An Innocent Man&quot;. In March 2012, it was announced that Gallagher would be co-starring with Jake Weber in &quot;Scared of the Dark&quot;, directed by Takashi Shimizu. Since 2002, Gallagher has been the voice of Riku in the video game series &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;.

In April 2024, it was announced that Gallagher and his former co-stars, Beverley Mitchell and Mackenzie Rosman, would co-host the &quot;7th Heaven&quot; rewatch podcast &quot;Catching up with the Camdens!&quot;.

<doc id="422690" wikidata="Q715856" url="?curid=422690" title="Coenred of Mercia">
<text>Coenred (also spelled Cenred or Cœnred fl. 675–709) was king of Mercia from 704 to 709. Mercia was an Anglo-Saxon kingdom in the English Midlands. He was a son of the Mercian king Wulfhere, whose brother Æthelred succeeded to the throne in 675 on Wulfhere&#x27;s death. In 704, Æthelred abdicated in favour of Coenred to become a monk.

Coenred&#x27;s reign is poorly documented, but a contemporary source records that he faced attacks from the Welsh. Coenred is not known to have married or had children, although later chronicles describe him as an ancestor of Wigstan, a 9th-century Mercian king. In 709, Coenred abdicated and went on pilgrimage to Rome, where he remained as a monk until his death. In the view of his contemporary, Bede, Coenred &quot;who had ruled the kingdom of Mercia for some time and very nobly, with still greater nobility renounced the throne of his kingdom&quot;. Æthelred&#x27;s son Ceolred succeeded Coenred as king of Mercia.

==Mercia in the 7th century==

By the 7th century, England was divided into kingdoms ruled almost entirely by the Anglo-Saxons, who had come to Britain two hundred years earlier. The kingdom of Mercia occupied what is now the English Midlands. Neighbouring kingdoms included Northumbria to the north, East Anglia to the east, and Wessex, the kingdom of the West Saxons, to the south. Essex, the kingdom of the East Saxons, included London and lay between East Anglia and the kingdom of Kent. The earliest Mercian king for whom there is definite historical information is Penda of Mercia, Coenred&#x27;s paternal grandfather.

The main source for this period is Bede&#x27;s &quot;Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum&quot; (Ecclesiastical History of the English People), completed in about 731. Despite its focus on the history of the church, this work provides valuable information about the early Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. Charters, which recorded royal grants of land to individuals and to religious houses, provide further information on Coenred&#x27;s reign, as does the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, compiled in Wessex at the end of the 9th century. The &quot;Chronicle&quot;&#x27;s anonymous scribe appears to have incorporated much information recorded in earlier periods. Coenred is also mentioned in two 8th-century hagiographies, those of Saint Wilfrid and Saint Guthlac.

==Ancestry and reign==
In 658, Coenred&#x27;s father Wulfhere came to the throne of Mercia as the result of a coup, ending a three-year period of Northumbrian control. Wulfhere was succeeded on his death (in 675) by his brother Æthelred, Coenred&#x27;s uncle, possibly because Coenred was too young to rule. Coenred&#x27;s mother Ermenilda became a nun sometime after Wulfhere&#x27;s death. Æthelred&#x27;s decisive victory over the Northumbrians at the Battle of the Trent in 679, followed by the Picts&#x27; destruction of the Northumbrian army at the Battle of Dun Nechtain in 685, reduced Northumbrian power and influence. There is evidence of Mercian activity in the south-east as well. Æthelred invaded Kent in 676, and charters survive in which he confirmed land grants made by Swæfheard and Oswine, kings of west and east Kent. Another charter of Æthelred&#x27;s, dated between 693 and 704, grants land to Waldhere, the bishop of London. However, Æthelred does not appear to have sought expansion further south. The growing strength of the West Saxons under Cædwalla and Ine would have limited Mercian opportunities in that direction.
The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; records that in 702 Coenred succeeded to the kingdom of the Southumbrians and that in 704 he became king of Mercia. As the &quot;Southumbrians&quot; were those who lived south of the Humber, Mercia&#x27;s northern boundary, the two annals have proved difficult to interpret: Coenred and Æthelred may have ruled jointly for two years before Æthelred abdicated, or the chroniclers may have recorded the same event twice, once from a source that was two years in error. According to the 8th-century life of St Guthlac, Æthelred appointed Coenred as his heir despite having at least one son of his own, Ceolred. Æthelred appears to have retained influence during his nephew&#x27;s reign: the &quot;Life of St Wilfrid&quot; relates how he summoned Coenred and made him swear to support Wilfrid in his conflict with the church hierarchy.

Coenred&#x27;s sparsely documented reign is mentioned in the &quot;Life of Guthlac&quot;. The author, Felix, reports conflicts with the Britons: &quot;in the days of Coenred King of the Mercians, [...] the Britons the implacable enemies of the Saxon race, were troubling the English with their attacks, their pillaging, and their devastations of the people [...]&quot; To counter such attacks, Æthelbald, who came to the throne in 716, was once thought to have built Wat&#x27;s Dyke, an earthwork barrier in northern Wales; but this now seems unlikely, since an excavation of the Dyke in 1997 found charcoal from a hearth which was radiocarbon-dated to some time between 411 and 561.

Some surviving charters from Coenred&#x27;s reign reveal him to have been the overlord of the East Saxon rulers. Offa, an East Saxon king, made a grant in the territory of the Hwicce (to which he may have been connected by a marriage of his father, Sigeheard) which was later confirmed by Coenred. In the charter, Coenred refers to Offa as his underking. Coenred and his successor also confirmed grants to Waldhere, the Bishop of London, evidence that London was firmly under Mercian overlordship. Later Mercian kings treated London as their direct possession, rather than as a province ruled by an underking, but Coenred did not go that far. A grant of land in Herefordshire to a nun named Feleburg has survived, as have forged charters in Coenred&#x27;s name granting privileges to St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, and to the Abbey of Evesham.

Mercia&#x27;s influence in Kent was limited both before and during Coenred&#x27;s reign. In a surviving letter (written in 704 or 705), Waldhere, Bishop of London, tells Berhtwald, Archbishop of Canterbury, that Coenred had invited him to a council to be held &quot;about the reconciliation of Ælfthryth&quot;. Waldhere refused the invitation as he did not know Berhtwald&#x27;s opinion on the matter, which was evidently important, although no other reference to it has survived. The letter describes a council to be held at Brentford to mediate between the kings of the East and West Saxons. In the view of the historian Frank Stenton, the letter illuminates the &quot;confused relations of the southern English at a moment when they had no common overlord&quot;. The reduced prestige of both Coenred and his successor, Ceolred, may have stirred unrest among the Mercian nobility: Æthelbald was in exile during Ceolred&#x27;s reign, and the survival of a hostile account of Ceolred may indicate a more general dissatisfaction with the ruling line.

==Abdication and succession==
Coenred appears to have been a very religious king. Bede tells a story of a companion of Coenred&#x27;s whose sins led him to damnation despite Coenred&#x27;s pleas that he should repent and reform. In 709 Coenred abdicated in favour of his cousin Ceolred, son of Æthelred, in order to become a monk in Rome; Bede&#x27;s story is cited by the medieval chronicler William of Malmesbury as the reason for Coenred&#x27;s decision, though this is probably guesswork. Coenred was accompanied by the East Saxon king Offa on his journey to Rome, and was made a monk there by Pope Constantine. The &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;, an early record of the lives of Popes, records the arrival of their party: &quot;in his time, two kings of the Saxons came with many others to pray to the apostles; just as they were hoping, their lives quickly came to an end.&quot; A later source, the 11th-century &quot;Vita Ecgwini&quot;, claims that Ecgwine accompanied Coenred and Offa to Rome, but historians have treated this with scepticism.

Historians have generally accepted Bede&#x27;s report of Coenred&#x27;s and Offa&#x27;s abdications, but Barbara Yorke has suggested that they may not have relinquished their thrones voluntarily. There are instances of kings being forcibly removed and placed in holy orders to make them ineligible for kingship; one such was King Osred II of Northumbria, who was forced into a monastery. On the other hand, if Coenred went willingly, as Bede relates, then the apparently friendly relationship between Offa and Coenred, his overlord, makes it clear that the relationship between an overlord and his underking was not hostile in every case.

Coenred was tonsured in Rome, whence he was accompanied by Offa, son of Sighere, king of the East Saxons, and became a monk &quot;at the threshold of the apostles&quot; as Bede had it; he stayed in Rome until his death, the date of which is unknown. He is not recorded as having a wife or children. The &quot;Evesham Chronicle&quot; kept at Evesham Abbey, however, claims that he was an ancestor of Wigstan. They do not say whether this was through Wigstan&#x27;s father, Wigmund, son of Wiglaf of Mercia, or through his mother, Ælfflæd, daughter of Ceolwulf I of Mercia.

<text>Decomposers are organisms that break down dead organisms and release the nutrients from the dead matter into the environment around them. Decomposition relies on chemical processes similar to digestion in animals; in fact, many sources use the words digestion and decomposition interchangeably. In both processes, complex molecules are chemically broken down by enzymes into simpler, smaller ones. The term &quot;digestion,&quot; however, is commonly used to refer to food breakdown that occurs within animal bodies, and results in the absorption of nutrients from the gut into the animal&#x27;s bloodstream. This is contrasted with external digestion, meaning that, rather than swallowing food and then digesting it using enzymes located within a GI tract, an organism instead releases enzymes directly onto the food source. After allowing the enzymes time to digest the material, the decomposer then absorbs the nutrients from the environment into its cells. Decomposition is often erroneously conflated with this process of external digestion, probably because of the strong association between fungi, which are external digesters, and decomposition.

The term &quot;decomposer&quot; refers to a role in an ecosystem, not to a particular class or type of organism, or even to a specific capacity of those organisms. The definition of &quot;decomposer&quot; therefore centers on the &quot;outcome&quot; of the decomposition process, rather than the types of organisms performing it. At the center of this definition are the organisms that benefit most directly from the increase in nutrient availability that results from decomposition; plants and other non-mobile (sessile) autotrophs cannot travel to seek out nutrients, and most cannot digest other organisms themselves. They must therefore rely on decomposers to free up nutrients from dead matter that they can then absorb.

Note that this definition does not focus on where digestion takes place (i.e. inside or outside of an organism&#x27;s body), but rather on where the products of that digestion end up. &quot;Decomposer&quot; as a category, therefore, would include not just fungi and bacteria, which perform external digestion, but also invertebrates such as earthworms, woodlice, and sea cucumbers that digest dead matter internally and release nutrients locally via their feces. In some definitions of decomposition that center on the means and location of digestion, these invertebrates, which digest their food internally, are set apart from decomposers and placed in a separate category called detritivores. These categories are not, in fact, mutually exclusive. &quot;Detritivore&quot; describes behavior and physiology, while &quot;decomposer&quot; describes an ecosystem role. Therefore, an organism can be both a detritivore and a decomposer.

While there are also purely physical processes, like weathering and ultraviolet light, that contribute to decomposition, &quot;decomposer&quot; refers only to living organisms that contribute to the process, whether by physical or chemical breakdown of dead matter.

== Terrestrial decomposers ==
In terrestrial environments, decomposition happens mainly in or on soil, and decomposers&#x27; activities lead to increased soil fertility. The main nutrients plants have to derive from soils are nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, and all three have to be available in forms that are accessible to and absorbable by the plants. Decomposition is the process of breaking large molecules in dead matter down into smaller molecules that nearby plants are able to take up through their roots. Some steps of the process occur via mechanical grinding and churning by things like earthworms and plant roots in a process called bioturbation. Further breakdown, beyond those physical means, requires the presence of enzymes. The paired processes are akin to what occurs in mammal digestive tracts: food is mechanically ground up by teeth, and then chemically broken down by enzymes.

A given organism&#x27;s ability to contribute to decomposition is largely dependent on what enzymes that organism possesses. Enzymes for the digestion of molecules like fats, proteins, and starch are widespread and many organisms, from microbes to mammals, have them. As a result, those molecules are the first to decompose in the environment. Cellulose in dead plants is broken down by cellulase enzymes, which are present in far fewer organisms, and the enzymes needed to digest lignin, a chemically complex molecule in woody trees and shrubs, in fewer still.
=== Fungi ===
The primary decomposer of litter in many ecosystems is fungi. Unlike bacteria, which are unicellular organisms and are decomposers as well, most saprotrophic fungi grow as a branching network of hyphae. Bacteria are restricted to growing and feeding on the exposed surfaces of organic matter, but fungi can use their hyphae to penetrate larger pieces of organic matter below the surface. Additionally, only wood-decay fungi have evolved lignin-modifying enzymes necessary to decompose lignin. These two factors make fungi the primary decomposers in forests, where litter has high concentrations of lignin and often occurs in large pieces like fallen trees and branches. Fungi decompose organic matter by releasing enzymes to break down the decaying material, after which they absorb the nutrients in the decaying material. Hyphae are used to break down matter and absorb nutrients and are also used in reproduction.

<text>USS &quot;O-9&quot; (SS-70) was an O-class submarine of the United States Navy.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;O-9&quot;′s keel was laid down on 15 February 1917 at Fore River Shipbuilding Company of Quincy, Massachusetts. She was launched on 27 January 1918, sponsored by Mrs. Frederick J. Sherman, and commissioned on 27 July 1918.

==Service history==
During the final months of World War I, &quot;O-9&quot; operated on coastal patrol and protected the Atlantic coast from U-boats. She departed Newport, Rhode Island, on 2 November 1918 for Britain, in order to conduct her first war patrol. However, the end of the war came before &quot;O-9&quot; reached Europe.

After the war, &quot;O-9&quot; continued in Naval service and trained submarine crews at the Submarine School at New London, Connecticut. Proceeding to Coco Solo, Panama Canal Zone, in 1924, the boat was reclassified to a second line submarine during her year there. Returning to operate at New London, &quot;O-9&quot; reverted to a first line submarine on 6 June 1928. Sailing up to Portsmouth, New Hampshire in January 1930, the submarine returned to New London in March; the following February, she sailed to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to decommission there on 25 June 1931.

Remaining on the Naval Vessel Register, &quot;O-9&quot; was recalled to training service as American involvement in World War II became more inevitable. The 12 s were already nearing completion and 73 boats had already been ordered when &quot;O-9&quot; was recommissioned at Philadelphia, on 14 April 1941, and went to New London on 31 May.

In all, eight of the original ten O-boats were recommissioned to serve as training submarines in the Second World War. (The had been sunk after a collision in 1923 and the &quot;O-1&quot; had been scrapped in 1938.) &quot;O-9&quot;, in particular, required extensive work, and still suffered mechanical problems even after being returned to service.

On the morning of 19 June 1941, &quot;O-9&quot; and two of her sisters, and , left as a group from the submarine base in New London, for the submarine test depth diving area east of the Isles of Shoals. Upon reaching their designated training area the following day, some off Portsmouth, New Hampshire, &quot;O-6&quot; made the first dive, followed by &quot;O-10&quot;. Finally, at 08:37, &quot;O-9&quot; began her dive. At 10:32, &quot;O-9&quot; had not returned to the surface.

Rescue ships swung into action immediately. Sister ships &quot;O-6&quot; and &quot;O-10&quot;, submarine , submarine rescue ship , and other ships searched for &quot;O-9&quot;. That evening, pieces of debris with markings from &quot;O-9&quot; were recovered. In water deep, she was thought to be crushed, since her hull was only designed to withstand depths of .

Divers went down from 13:00 on 21 June until 11:43 on 22 June. Divers could stay only a short time at the depth but nonetheless set endurance and depth records for salvage operations until those operations were cancelled, as they were considered too risky. Rescue operations were discontinued on 22 June. The boat and her 33 officers and men were declared lost as of 20 June. On 22 June, Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox conducted memorial services for the 33 officers and men lost on the boat.

==Wreck==
On 20 September 1997, based on several years of research by Glen M. Reem, &quot;O-9&quot; was finally located. Salem, New Hampshire-based Klein Sonar Company provided a vessel and sonar equipment which were used to discover &quot;O-9&quot;″s final resting place. Her hull has been crushed from just abaft the conning tower all the way to the stern, though the forward hull appeared intact. There are no plans to salvage &quot;O-9&quot;. Her exact location is secret and the area has been designated an official naval burial ground.

&quot;O-9&quot; was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 23 October 1941.

==In popular culture==

In H.P. Lovecraft&#x27;s short story &quot;The Shadow Over Innsmouth&quot;, written in 1931, a US Navy submarine is described as firing torpedoes into the undersea habitation of Deep Ones off the fictional Innsmouth, Massachusetts. More recently, and following Lovecraft&#x27;s own pretense of presenting a pseudo-historical tale, Kenneth Hite and Kennon Bauman have depicted the submarine as being &quot;O-9&quot; in their book &quot;The Cthulhu Wars&quot;. In doing so they presented the vessel&#x27;s loss in 1941 as having been related to the fictional torpedo attack on the Deep Ones. They even mentioned the actual commander of &quot;O-9&quot; in 1927-28, Lieutenant J.T. Acree. Another real-life vessel mentioned by Hite and Bauman is the USCGC &quot;General Greene&quot; (WPC-140; later WSC-140 and WMEC-140), which served in the United States Coast Guard from 1927 until decommissioning on 15 November 1968; this cutter was sold in 1976.

<doc id="422703" wikidata="Q1481766" url="?curid=422703" title="Tubal">
<text>Tubal (, &quot;Tuḇāl&quot;), in Genesis 10 (the &quot;Table of Nations&quot;), was the name of a son of Japheth, son of Noah. Modern scholarship has identified him with Tabal. Traditionally, he is considered to be the father of the Caucasian Iberians (ancestors of the Georgians) according to primary sources. Later, Saint Jerome refashioned the Caucasian Iberia (Georgia) into the Iberian Peninsula (Western Europe) and Isidore of Seville consolidated this idea.

==Modern scholarship==
Modern scholarship has identified the biblical Tubal with Tabal, an Anatolian state and region mentioned in Assyrian sources.

Tabal was a post-Hittite Luwian state in Asia Minor in the 1st millennium BC. Its neighbours, the Mushki, are traditionally associated with Meshech. Some historians further connect Tabal and Tubal with the tribe on the Black Sea coast later known to the Greeks as Tibareni, although this connection is uncertain. The Tibareni and nearby tribes, the &quot;Chalybes&quot; (Khalib/Khaldi) and the Mossynoeci (&quot;Mossynoikoi&quot; in Greek), were sometimes considered the founders of metallurgy. The Greeks considered the Tibareni to be a Scythian people. 

Most reference books, following Flavius Josephus, identify Tubal in Ezekiel&#x27;s time as an area that is now in Turkey.

==Early theories==
Many authors, following the Jewish historian Josephus (1st century AD), related the name to &quot;Iber&quot;- Caucasian Iberia. Concerning the question of the ethnic affinity of the population of Tubal, Josephus wrote: &quot;Tobal gave rise to the Thobeles, who are now called Iberes&quot; - Caucasian Iberia. This version was repeated by Patriarch Eustathius of Antioch, Bishop Theodoret, and others. However, Jerome, Isidore of Seville, and the Welsh historian Nennius stated another tradition that Tubal was ancestor to not only Iberians, but also the &#x27;Italians&#x27; [i.e., Italic tribes] and &#x27;Spanish&#x27; [who were also called Iberians]. A divergent tradition recorded by Hippolytus of Rome (3rd century) lists Tubal&#x27;s descendants as the &quot;Hettali&quot; (or Thessalians in some later copies), while the &quot;Book of the Bee&quot; (c. 1222) states that he was progenitor of Bithynians.

Tubal&#x27;s sons are given different names in rabbinic sources. In Pseudo-Philo (written c. AD 70), his son&#x27;s names are &quot;Phanatonova&quot; and &quot;Eteva&quot;, and they were given the land of &quot;Pheed&quot;. The later mediaeval &quot;Chronicles of Jerahmeel&quot; gives these sons&#x27; names as &quot;Fantonya&quot; and &quot;Atipa&quot;, and says they subdued &quot;Pahath&quot;; elsewhere these chronicles include information derived from Jerome, identifying Tubal&#x27;s descendants with Iberia and Hispania. In still another place, the &quot;Chronicles of Jerahmeel&quot; reproduces a more detailed legend taken from the earlier &quot;Josippon&quot; (c. 950): Tubal&#x27;s descendants, it says, camped in Tuscany and built a city called &quot;Sabino&quot;, while the Kittim built &quot;Posomanga&quot; in neighboring Campania, with the Tiber river as the frontier between the two peoples. However, they soon went to war following the rape of the Sabines by the Kittim. This war was ended when the Kittim showed the descendants of Tubal their mutual progeny. A shorter, more garbled version of this story from &quot;Yosippon&quot; is also found in the later &quot;Book of Jasher&quot;, known from c. 1625, which additionally names Tubal&#x27;s sons as &quot;Ariphi&quot;, &quot;Kesed&quot; and &quot;Taari&quot;.

==Later theories==

Basque intellectuals like Andrés de Poza (16th century) have named Tubal as the ancestor of Basques, and by extension, the Iberians. The French Basque author Augustin Chaho (19th century) published &quot;The Legend of Aitor&quot;, asserting that the common patriarch of the Basques was Aitor, a descendant of Tubal.

According to Catalan legend, Japheth&#x27;s son Tubal is said to have sailed from Jaffa with his family and arrived at the Francolí river of the Iberian Peninsula in 2157 BC, where he founded a city named after his son &quot;Tarraho&quot;, now Tarragona. He then proceeded to the Ebro (like Iberia, named after his second son &quot;Iber&quot;), where he built several more settlements, including Amposta. His third son&#x27;s name is given as &quot;Semptofail&quot;. Noah himself is said to have visited them here about 100 years later. Tubal is said to have reigned for 155 years, until he died while preparing to colonize Mauretania and was succeeded by Iber. 

Other traditions make Tubal son of Japheth (sometimes confounded with Tubal-cain son of Lamech, a figure from before the flood) to be the founder of Ravenna in Italy, Setúbal in Portugal, and Toledo and many other places in Spain. Various authors state that his wife&#x27;s name was Noya, that he was buried at Cape St. Vincent in Portugal, or that he had 65,000 descendants when he died. The source for many of these legends seems to have been the &quot;Pseudo-Berosus&quot; published by Annio da Viterbo in 1498, now widely considered a forgery. However, the earlier &quot;Chronicle of San Juan de la Peña&quot; by the historian-king Pedro IV of Aragon (c. 1370) includes the basic premises, that Tubal was the first person to settle in Iberia, that the Iberians were descended from him as Jerome and Isidore had attested, and that they had originally been called &quot;Cetubales&quot; and been settled along the Ebro, before changing their name to &#x27;Iberians&#x27; after that river. 

An earlier scholar-king, Alfonso X of Castile (c. 1280), also included similar details in his history, but claiming Tubal had settled in the &quot;Aspa&quot; mountains (part of the Pyrenees), and deriving the first part of the name &quot;Cetubales&quot; from &quot;cetus&quot;, which he said meant &quot;tribe&quot;. In his version, they later changed their name to &#x27;Celtiberians&#x27;. A still earlier version is found in the history of the Umayyad conquest of Hispania by Tariq ibn Ziyad, written around AD 750 by Abulcasim Tarif Abentarique. It holds that Japheth&#x27;s son Tubal or (Sem Tofail) divided Iberia among his 3 sons — leaving his eldest Tarraho the northeast section (called &quot;Tarrahon&quot;, later Aragon); to his second son, Sem Tofail the younger, he left the west, along the ocean (later called &quot;Setúbal&quot;); and to his youngest, Iber, he left the eastern part, along the Mediterranean, called &quot;Iberia&quot;. Tubal then built for himself a city he called &quot;Morar&quot; (today Mérida, Spain) — where Abentarique claimed to have seen a large stone above the main city gate inscribed with these details, which he translated into Arabic.

The Arabic dictionary &quot;Taj al-Arus&quot; by al-Zubaidi (1790) notes that although some Islamic authors make the Khazars descendants of Japheth&#x27;s son Khasheh (Meshech), others hold both the Khazars and Saqaliba (Slavs) to have come rather from his brother, Tubal.

Benjamin Martin, an 18th century lexicographer who compiled one of the early English dictionaries, published in his study on natural philosophy the &quot;Bibliotheca Technologica&quot; that Tubal &quot;is affirmed to be the father of the Asiatic Iberians&quot;.
The Caucasian Iberians were ancestors of modern Georgians. Some modern Georgians also claim descent from Tubal, Togarmah and Meshech; a Georgian historian, Ivane Javakhishvili, considered Tabal, Tubal, Jabal and Jubal to be ancient Georgian tribal designations.

<text>Mark Atkins is an Australian Aboriginal musician known for his skill on the didgeridoo, a traditional instrument.

Mark Atkins is also a storyteller, songwriter, composer and painter. He descends from the Yamatji people of Western Australia. He was the 1990 winner of the Golden Didjeridu competition. He has worked with Robert Plant and Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin, Hothouse Flowers, Marlene Cummins, Philip Glass, The Black Arm Band and the London Philharmonic Orchestra, among others.
In Didgeridoo Concerto (1994) he plays for over 50 minutes continuously using the circular breathing technique; an unofficial world record at the time.
In 2001, he collaborated with Wurundjeri elder Joy Murphy Wandin and composer Philip Glass in the concert work &quot;Voices&quot;, performed at the Melbourne Town Hall and New York&#x27;s Lincoln Center. The composition was commissioned by the City of Melbourne to relaunch the Melbourne Town Hall Organ. 

Atkins was profiled in the television documentary &quot;Yamatji Man&quot; in 2003.

<doc id="422711" wikidata="Q256355" url="?curid=422711" title="Equivariant map">
<text>In mathematics, equivariance is a form of symmetry for functions from one space with symmetry to another (such as symmetric spaces). A function is said to be an equivariant map when its domain and codomain are acted on by the same symmetry group, and when the function commutes with the action of the group. That is, applying a symmetry transformation and then computing the function produces the same result as computing the function and then applying the transformation.

Equivariant maps generalize the concept of invariants, functions whose value is unchanged by a symmetry transformation of their argument. The value of an equivariant map is often (imprecisely) called an invariant.

In statistical inference, equivariance under statistical transformations of data is an important property of various estimation methods; see invariant estimator for details. In pure mathematics, equivariance is a central object of study in equivariant topology and its subtopics equivariant cohomology and equivariant stable homotopy theory.

==Examples==
===Elementary geometry===

In the geometry of triangles, the area and perimeter of a triangle are invariants under Euclidean transformations: translating, rotating, or reflecting a triangle does not change its area or perimeter. However, triangle centers such as the centroid, circumcenter, incenter and orthocenter are not invariant, because moving a triangle will also cause its centers to move. Instead, these centers are equivariant: applying any Euclidean congruence (a combination of a translation and rotation) to a triangle, and then constructing its center, produces the same point as constructing the center first, and then applying the same congruence to the center. More generally, all triangle centers are also equivariant under similarity transformations (combinations of translation, rotation, reflection, and scaling),
and the centroid is equivariant under affine transformations.

The same function may be an invariant for one group of symmetries and equivariant for a different group of symmetries. For instance, under similarity transformations instead of congruences the area and perimeter are no longer invariant: scaling a triangle also changes its area and perimeter. However, these changes happen in a predictable way: if a triangle is scaled by a factor of , the perimeter also scales by and the area scales by . In this way, the function mapping each triangle to its area or perimeter can be seen as equivariant for a multiplicative group action of the scaling transformations on the positive real numbers.

===Statistics===
Another class of simple examples comes from statistical estimation. The mean of a sample (a set of real numbers) is commonly used as a central tendency of the sample. It is equivariant under linear transformations of the real numbers, so for instance it is unaffected by the choice of units used to represent the numbers. By contrast, the mean is not equivariant with respect to nonlinear transformations such as exponentials.

The median of a sample is equivariant for a much larger group of transformations, the (strictly) monotonic functions of the real numbers. This analysis indicates that the median is more robust against certain kinds of changes to a data set, and that (unlike the mean) it is meaningful for ordinal data.

The concepts of an invariant estimator and equivariant estimator have been used to formalize this style of analysis.

===Representation theory===
In the representation theory of finite groups, a vector space equipped with a group that acts by linear transformations of the space is called a linear representation of the group.
A linear map that commutes with the action is called an intertwiner. That is, an intertwiner is just an equivariant linear map between two representations. Alternatively, an intertwiner for representations of a group over a field is the same thing as a module homomorphism of -modules, where is the group ring of &quot;G&quot;.

Under some conditions, if &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are both irreducible representations, then an intertwiner (other than the zero map) only exists if the two representations are equivalent (that is, are isomorphic as modules). That intertwiner is then unique up to a multiplicative factor (a non-zero scalar from ). These properties hold when the image of is a simple algebra, with centre (by what is called Schur&#x27;s lemma: see simple module). As a consequence, in important cases the construction of an intertwiner is enough to show the representations are effectively the same.

==Formalization==
Equivariance can be formalized using the concept of a -set for a group . This is a mathematical object consisting of a mathematical set and a group action (on the left) of on .
If and are both -sets for the same group , then a function is said to be equivariant if
for all and all .

If one or both of the actions are right actions the equivariance condition may be suitably modified:
:; (right-right)
:; (right-left)
:; (left-right)

Equivariant maps are homomorphisms in the category of &quot;G&quot;-sets (for a fixed &quot;G&quot;). Hence they are also known as G&quot;-morphisms, G&quot;-maps, or &quot;G&quot;-homomorphisms. Isomorphisms of &quot;G&quot;-sets are simply bijective equivariant maps.

The equivariance condition can also be understood as the following commutative diagram. Note that formula_1 denotes the map that takes an element formula_2 and returns formula_3.

==Generalization==
Equivariant maps can be generalized to arbitrary categories in a straightforward manner. Every group &quot;G&quot; can be viewed as a category with a single object (morphisms in this category are just the elements of &quot;G&quot;). Given an arbitrary category &quot;C&quot;, a &quot;representation&quot; of &quot;G&quot; in the category &quot;C&quot; is a functor from &quot;G&quot; to &quot;C&quot;. Such a functor selects an object of &quot;C&quot; and a subgroup of automorphisms of that object. For example, a &quot;G&quot;-set is equivalent to a functor from &quot;G&quot; to the category of sets, Set, and a linear representation is equivalent to a functor to the category of vector spaces over a field, Vect&quot;K&quot;.

Given two representations, ρ and σ, of &quot;G&quot; in &quot;C&quot;, an equivariant map between those representations is simply a natural transformation from ρ to σ. Using natural transformations as morphisms, one can form the category of all representations of &quot;G&quot; in &quot;C&quot;. This is just the functor category &quot;C&quot;&quot;G&quot;.

For another example, take &quot;C&quot; = Top, the category of topological spaces. A representation of &quot;G&quot; in Top is a topological space on which &quot;G&quot; acts continuously. An equivariant map is then a continuous map &quot;f&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; between representations which commutes with the action of &quot;G&quot;.

<text>The Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS ) is a charity and private limited company based in Cheltenham, England, which provides educational support services. Formed on July 27, 1993 by the merger of the former university admissions system, Universities Central Council on Admissions and the former polytechnics admissions system, Polytechnics Central Admissions System, the company&#x27;s main role is to operate the application process for British universities and colleges. The company is funded by fees charged to applicants and universities as well as advertising income.

Services provided by UCAS include several online application portals, several search tools and free information and advice directed at various audiences, including students considering higher education, students with pending applications to higher education institutes, parents and legal guardians of applicants, school and further education college staff involved in helping students apply and providers of higher education (universities and HE colleges).

UCAS is most known for its undergraduate application service (the main UCAS scheme), however it also operates a number of other admissions services:
* UCAS Conservatoires - application and search service for performing arts at the UK conservatoire.
* UCAS Teacher Training (UTT) – for postgraduate teacher training schemes.
* UCAS Postgraduate – application and search facility for some postgraduate courses.

==Location==
UCAS is based near Marle Hill in Cheltenham at the junction of the B4075 (&quot;New Barn Lane&quot;) and the A435 (&quot;Evesham Road&quot;), near Cheltenham Racecourse and a park and ride. It is situated just inside the parish of Prestbury, Gloucestershire.

==History==
UCAS was formed in 1992 by the merger of Universities Central Council on Admissions (UCCA) and Polytechnics Central Admissions System (PCAS) and the name UCAS is a contraction of the former acronyms UCCA and PCAS. An early proposal was made for the new merged body to be called PUCCA (Polytechnics and Universities Central Council on Admissions) but this was never adopted.

UCCA was the older of the two bodies, having been formed in 1961 to provide a clearing house for university applications in the United Kingdom. It was created in response to concerns during the 1950s that the increase in University applications was unmanageable using the systems then in place, where each student applied individually to as many institutions as they chose. This concern led to the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals (CVCP) setting up an ad hoc committee in 1957 to review the matter; this committee in its Third Report of January 1961, recommended the setting up of a central agency, which subsequently became known as UCCA. Its First and Second Reports had already made several recommendations aimed at harmonising admissions procedures across different universities.

The name UCCA referred originally to the management board (the Central Council) overseeing the new process but soon came to refer to the organisation responsible for its day-to-day operation. This was based initially in London and moved to Cheltenham, Gloucestershire in 1968. The new scheme had a pilot year handling a subset of applications for entry in 1963 and its first full year of operation handled admissions for 1964.

The scheme was essentially a collaborative venture between independent universities and membership was voluntary. Most English universities joined from the start. Oxford and Cambridge joined (with slightly modified procedures) for the 1966 entry; the London medical and dental schools, as well as Belfast and Stirling for the 1967. In 1965, UCCA handled 80,033 applicants, rising to 114,289 in 1969. The acceptance rate of UCCA applicants by universities in 1969 stood at just over 50%.

Initially, the processing of applications was carried out using punched card technology. In 1964, UCCA started using the services of a computer bureau with a Univac machine; in 1967 it installed its own Univac computer.

Although the polytechnics were degree-teaching institutions, through the CNAA awards system, they were not eligible for admission to UCCA as it was reserved only for universities with degree-awarding powers. Despite this, the Polytechnics were involved as early as 1972 in discussions with UCCA and the Central Register and Clearing House about the possible future shape of one or more admissions systems. At this stage applicants dealt directly with each individual polytechnic and the polytechnics themselves were strongly regional or local in their appeal. A study in 1977 found that between sixty and seventy per cent of those admitted to a polytechnic had applied to that institution only and that forty percent of admissions to polytechnics resulted from applications made in August or September of the year of entry.

In 1983 the Committee of Directors of Polytechnics began negotiations with UCCA to share its computing, technical and office facilities in Cheltenham to establish a course entrance system, based on the existing model used by UCCA. A grant of £210,000, from the British Department for Education and Science, was awarded to set up a new unified admissions system, provisionally called PUCCA. However, instead of a unified system for both the universities and polytechnics, a separate system for polytechnics emerged from the negotiations, modelled on UCCA but known as PCAS. Applicants to courses were given the option to apply separately for universities or polytechnics, or both.

The PCAS system came into effect in 1985. It was led by its first Chief Executive, Tony Higgins and in the first year it handled around 140,000 applications to polytechnic courses, of whom 40,000 a year went on to study at polytechnics.

Although many polytechnics offered art and design programmes and some also offered teacher training courses, these admissions systems remained outside PCAS. Art and Design admissions worked to a later timetable as a result of the role Art Foundation courses had in developing a student&#x27;s proposed specialism (painting, sculpture, graphic design, and so on). Work was furthermore generally submitted before a decision was made on whether to interview. However, means of absorbing the Art and Design Admissions Registry into UCAS were found by 1996.

Although the aim to create a fully unified application system for universities and polytechnics was not achieved until 1994, from the &#x27;80s onwards Tony Higgins, the Chief Executive of PCAS, continued to push for the merger of PCAS with UCCA. In 1992, following the change of status and name of most polytechnics to universities, the two bodies combined under Higgins&#x27;s leadership. Initially the application form was branded jointly UCCA/PCAS but in 1994 the new merged body was officially renamed UCAS.

In 2015, the Amsterdam Fashion Academy became the first non-UK educational establishment admitted to UCAS.

==Undergraduate admissions schemes==

=== Main undergraduate scheme ===
Since the vast majority of UK universities and higher education colleges use the UCAS service, most students planning to study for an undergraduate degree in the UK must apply through UCAS – including home students and international students.

==== Application ====

To apply to university, students must submit a single application via UCAS&#x27;s online Apply service. The application itself requires the student to register to the service, giving a &quot;buzzword&quot; if applying through a centre, fill in personal details, write a personal statement and choose up to five courses to apply to, in no order of preference. They must then pay an application fee and obtain a reference before submitting their application online by the appropriate deadline. The application is then forwarded by UCAS to the universities and colleges that the students have applied to. After following their internal policies, which may include an interview, the institutions then decide whether to make students an offer of a place. An institution can make a student either an unconditional offer, where the student is assured a place, or a conditional offer, where the student will receive a place subject to specific grades being met. In certain circumstances, the university may withdraw the application before interviews, though this usually only occurs by some action on the applicant&#x27;s part (not replying to emails in time for example).

For applications to universities in the UK, entry requirements for individual courses can either be based on grades of qualifications (e.g. AAA at GCE A-Level, a score of 43/45 in the IB International Baccalaureate Diploma, or a music diploma) or in UCAS points (e.g. 300 UCAS points from 3 A-Levels or an IB score equal to 676 UCAS points). To convert individual scores or grades of specific qualifications into UCAS points, UCAS has created tariff tables indicating indexes and ratios of UCAS points and results of qualifications. For example, an A* at A-level is worth 56 UCAS points, an A 48, a B 40, and so on. For the IB, a score of 45 equals 720 UCAS points, a score of 40 is 611 points, a score of 35 is 501 etc.

==== Personal details ====
Once logged into &quot;Apply&quot;, applicants complete a number of personal details – including their current qualifications, employment, criminal history, national identity, ethnic origin and student finance arrangements. Applicants also have the option to declare if they have any individual needs – such as any disabilities; or if they are a care leaver.

==== Personal statements ====
The personal statement is an integral part of the application. It gives candidates a chance to write about their achievements, their interest in the subject they are applying for, as well as their suitability, interest and commitment to higher education. Personal statements can contain a maximum of 4,000 characters (including spaces) or 47 lines – whichever comes first, with a maximum of 94 characters per line. A research study conducted by UCAS with over 300,000 personal statements of students revealed that the personal statement (among the student&#x27;s grades) is the most important part within the application process. Plagiarism in personal statements is common and UCAS uses Copycatch software to detect personal statements that are considered to have 30% or more &quot;similarity&quot; to statements submitted by others. The free-form nature of the application also lead some applications to complete the essay in an absurdist manner.

Due to being viewed by some as being rooted in class bias, UCAS began phasing out the statement in 2023, with the college class of 2025 being the last one mandated to complete it.

==== Application fees and references ====

The final part of the process involves paying an application fee and obtaining a written reference. The process varies depending on whether a student is applying through a school, college, or UCAS centre or as an individual.

For the former, applications are sent to the school, college, or centre, who may ask applicants to pay their fee to them (which they then pass to UCAS) or pay UCAS directly, before they provide a reference and submit the form on the student&#x27;s behalf. If applications are sent to the school, college, or centre, then they will attach a reference to send to UCAS. Applicants are responsible for ensuring that their school, college, or centre submits the application before the appropriate deadline for their courses.

Individual applicants should request their reference – from a teacher, adviser, or professional who knows them – before paying the fee and submitting the form themselves.

For most current applications, the cost per student is £22 to apply for a single course or £26.50 for two or more courses (as of 2022 entry).

==== Application deadlines ====
Depending on the subject and on the university that they are applying for, candidates must submit their application by the relevant submission deadline to ensure their application is given &quot;equal consideration&quot; by the higher education providers they are applying to. The term &quot;equal consideration&quot; refers to the obligation on all course providers to &quot;consider all applications received by this time equally&quot;.

* 15 October deadline: Those applying for medicine, dentistry and veterinary science courses and anyone applying to the universities of Oxford and Cambridge must submit their UCAS applications by 15 October – in the year before the student wishes to start their studies.
* 25 January deadline (in 2023): The majority of applications must be submitted by 6 p.m. on 25 January (in the calendar year that the student wishes to begin their studies).
* 24 March deadline: Some art and design courses have a later application deadline – 24 March – to give applicants time to complete their portfolios.

It is possible for students to submit applications up until 30 June each year; but a late submission may not be given the same consideration as those submitted before the deadline. Applications received after 30 June are placed directly into Clearing.

==== Offers ====

Students must adhere to the appropriate deadline for their course. Whilst UCAS advises universities and colleges to send their decisions by the end of March, the universities have the responsibility of responding to applicants and may operate in their timescale. Many universities (like the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge) require that applicants come to an interview or be interviewed online before offers are received, or they may be asked to submit an additional piece of work before receiving an offer.

Offers are made through the UCAS Track service by universities and are either unconditional or conditional, where the latter means that the student will receive a place dependent on exam performance. Applicants also find out if they have been rejected through UCAS Track.

Once an applicant has received a reply from their choices, they must reply to their university before the deadline in May. Applicants normally choose two offers through UCAS, one as their firm choice and one as their insurance choice. A firm choice means that, if the student receives the grades required, then the student&#x27;s conditional offer will be confirmed. An insurance choice means that, if the firm choice is a university that eventually rejects them due to their grades, then the student will get into that university if they have met the terms and conditions of the insurance choice&#x27;s conditions. A student may only make an insurance choice if their firm choice is a conditional offer.

Certain universities have engaged in the dubious practice of making a &quot;conditional unconditional&quot; offer, meaning that a student was advised by the university that they would get an unconditional offer (and not then need to meet grade targets) but only if they made that university their firm choice. This served to guarantee both that the student would have a place and that the place would not be turned down if the student hit the grades required for a better or preferred course. This practice was temporarily banned at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and the UK government discourages universities from giving out these offers.

==== Extra ====

If an applicant uses all of their five choices and does not receive any offers, or they decide to decline the offers they receive, they can apply for additional courses using UCAS&#x27; Extra service. This allows them to keep applying, one course at a time until they receive an offer they&#x27;re happy with. Extra runs between mid-February and the end of June. If they do not receive an offer during this time, they have the option to enter into Clearing when it opens in July.

==== Confirmation and clearing ====

When applicants receive their examination results, they will know if they have met the conditions of their firm and insurance choices. Universities give out unconditional offers and rejections when applicants receive their examination results.

Those that do have their offers confirmed are invited to accept a place on the course they applied to, which is called &quot;confirmation&quot;. Many universities and colleges still accept students that narrowly miss their offer conditions.

Those that do not meet their &quot;firm&quot; and &quot;insurance&quot; offer conditions are eligible to use UCAS&#x27; Clearing service – which enables unplaced students to apply for courses with vacancies directly to the university. They do so by searching for an available course, using the UCAS search tool and contacting each university or college concerned for a place.

Although most available places are published following results days in August, it opens at the start of July each year and closes in October.

==== Adjustment ====

Through what was known as &quot;Adjustment&quot;, if applicants exceeded the conditions of their firm offer, they had the option to search for a place at another university or college while retaining their original offer. Adjustment was cancelled in 2022 and is no longer available.

=== UCAS Conservatoires – performing arts scheme ===

UCAS operates Conservatoires UK Admissions Service (formally known as CUKAS) in conjunction with Conservatoires UK, managing applications for both undergraduate and postgraduate music, dance, and drama courses at nine UK conservatoires:

* Guildhall School of Music and Drama, London
* Leeds Conservatoire
* Royal Academy of Music, London
* Royal Birmingham Conservatoire (part of Birmingham City University)
* Royal College of Music, London
* Royal Northern College of Music, Manchester
* Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, Glasgow
* Royal Welsh College of Music &amp; Drama, Cardiff
* Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance, London

Students must apply through the online CUKAS service by:
* 1 October – for most music courses
* 15 January – for most undergraduate dance, drama, and screen production courses

== UCAS postgraduate admissions schemes ==

=== UTT – postgraduate teacher training ===
UCAS Teacher Training (UTT) is an application service for postgraduates that want to become teachers. UTT replaced UCAS&#x27; previous GTTR teacher training application service and expanded its remit to provide centralised admissions for School Direct and school-centred initial teacher training (SCITT) programs.

UTT programmes are either university/college-taught or school-based and typically last for one academic year; usually leading to a PGCE qualification.

Students begin their application in the autumn for programmes starting in the following academic year. They start by using Apply 1 – which allows them to choose up to three programmes. Training providers then have 40 working days to make an offer. During this time they will invite candidates they&#x27;re considering offering a place for an interview. At the end of the 40-day period, students will have responses from their three choices and will have 10 working days to reply to any offers.

However, if students don&#x27;t get offered a place using Apply 1, or they choose to decline all of the offers they receive, they can use Apply 2 to apply for new places, adding one choice at a time, until they receive an offer. 
* Apply 1 opens on 21 November each year
* Apply 2 opens on 2 January each year

=== UCAS Postgraduate – postgraduate admissions scheme ===

UCAS Postgraduate (also known as UK PASS) is UCAS&#x27; postgraduate admissions service. It was introduced with the objective to offer students access to over 20,000 courses at 18 participating universities and colleges in England, Scotland and Wales – both taught and research courses leading to a variety of qualifications – including MA, MSc, MBA and LLM.

==Other schemes==

=== UCAS Progress – post-16 education and training admissions scheme ===
UCAS has launched UCAS Progress, a service enabling GCSE students to search and apply for post-16 work and education-based training courses – including academic and vocational courses (such as A levels and BTECs), as well as Apprenticeship and Traineeship programmes.

The scheme is free for students to use and is implemented as a national service – listing post-16 opportunities from all across the UK.

UCAS Progress also helps schools, colleges and local authorities address recruitment issues and statutory obligations resulting from raising the age of participation in secondary education; an initiative that legally obliges students to remain in full-time education or work-based training until the end of the academic year that they turn 17. However, this is about to change after government reforms; when students will be required to remain in education or training until their 18th birthday.

== UCAS Media ==

UCAS Media is a commercial enterprise that raises money by offering commercial organisations and education providers a channel to communicate with prospective students: in effect, it sells targeted advertising space. UCAS is a non-governmental and not-for-profit company. UCAS undergraduate admissions handled almost three million applications from 700,000 UK, EU and international students.

UCAS Media does not disclose information about applicants to its advertising clients. However, it does send advertisements to applicants on behalf of its clients and can target specific groups such as &#x27;early adopters&#x27; or those located in a specific location.

All UCAS Media profits are fed back into the UCAS charity, much of which is gift aided. This reduces the fees paid by universities and by applicants for access to the UCAS service.

UCAS Media has proven controversial among data privacy campaigners. In 2014 deputy director of Big Brother Watch, Emma Carr was quoted as saying: 

In 2019, Martin Lewis, the consumer finance expert, accused UCAS of abusing its position after it allowed a private debt company to promote high interest commercial loans to school leavers. UCAS had sent an email promoting loans by Future Finance, with interest rates of up to 23.7%, well above the current maximum of 5.4% on student loans and worse than most high street credit cards. In response, UCAS said: &quot;UCAS is an independent charity ... This helps us to keep the costs for students applying to university as low as possible.&quot;

<text>Morgause () is a popular variant of the figure of the Queen of Orkney, an Arthurian legend character also known by various other names and appearing in different forms of her archetype. She is the mother of Gawain and often also of Mordred, both key players in the story of her brother King Arthur and his downfall.

In the early chronicles and romances based on or inspired by Geoffrey of Monmouth, as well as in the Welsh tradition, her figure and role are commonly that of Gawain&#x27;s mother, and she is either a full or half sister to Arthur. In most cases, she is the wife or widow of King Lot, ruling over either Orkney or Lothian. However, her name varies widely between texts, as does the issue of her children other than Gawain, and Mordred&#x27;s own parentage is often only presumed rather than stated.

In a later popular tradition, Mordred becomes the offspring of Arthur&#x27;s own accidental incest with his estranged half-sister, whom Thomas Malory&#x27;s seminal &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; calls Morgause. Married to Lot, she is also mother of the Knights of the Round Table Gawain, Agravain, Gareth, and Gaheris, the last of whom murders her in some late romances including Malory&#x27;s compilation. Furthermore, she has been turned into a sister of Morgan, with whom she is often conflated into a single character by modern authors.

==Medieval literature==
===Character history and counterparts===
The corresponding character in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s early-12th-century Norman-Welsh chronicle &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; is named Anna, who is depicted as the sole daughter of Uther Pendragon and his wife Igraine, thus making her Arthur&#x27;s full (younger) sister. She is the wife of King Lot and the mother of Gawain and presumably also Mordred (the text describes the latter only as another nephew of Arthur but without never mentioning other of Arthur&#x27;s sisters besides her). However, Geoffrey says very little about her otherwise. This was later elaborated in the romance &quot;De Ortu Waluuanii&quot;, telling how the teenage Lot fell in mutual love with the also young Anna while serving as her page when he was a royal hostage at the court of Uther. 

In Layamon&#x27;s English &quot;Brut&quot;, Anna and Lot, king of Scotland, are said (through Merlin&#x27;s prophecy) to have seven children in all, but her only male offspring are Gawain and Mordred. Wace&#x27;s Norman chronicle &quot;Roman de Brut&quot; calls her queen of the Scots, even as her husband Lot is not truly a king there, and mother of Gawain. However, it does not mention either hers or Gawain&#x27;s relation to Mordred (again described only as Arthur&#x27;s nephew). According to John Fordun&#x27;s 14th-century Scottish chronicle, &quot;Chronica Gentis Scotorum&quot;, Anna was the rightful heir to the throne (since Arthur was merely Uther&#x27;s bastard son), and so was, consequently, hers and Lot&#x27;s son Mordred. This motif is followed in the later Scottish chronicle tradition as well. In Hector Boece&#x27;s &quot;Historia Gentis Scotorum&quot;, for instance, the wife of the Pictish king Loth is Anna, later called Cristina, the &quot;queen of the Picts of great honour and fame.&quot; Here, too, she is depicted as the rightful heir of Uther—but, relatively uniquely, as Uther&#x27;s sister (Arthur&#x27;s aunt) instead of his daughter.

A parent of Gawain&#x27;s Welsh forerunner, Gwalchmei ap Gwyar (in later Welsh Arthurian literature, Gawain is synonymous with the native champion Gwalchmei), is one Gwyar. A very early Welsh Arthurian tale (considered to predate that of Geoffrey), &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;, also gives Gwalchmai son of Gwyar (fab Gwyar) a brother named Gwalhafed son of Gwyar. &quot;Gwyar&quot; (meaning &quot;gore&quot; or &quot;spilled blood/bloodshed&quot;) is likely the name of Gwalchmei&#x27;s mother, rather than his father as is the standard in the Welsh Triads. Matronyms were sometimes used in Wales, as in the case of Math fab Mathonwy and Gwydion fab Dôn, and were also fairly common in early Ireland. Gwyar is indeed named as a female in one version of the hagiographical genealogy &quot;Bonedd y Saint&quot;, which identifies her as a daughter of Amlawdd Wledig, and thus again as Arthur&#x27;s aunt instead of his sister. The 14th-century fragment &quot;Birth of Arthur&quot; substitutes hee with Geoffrey&#x27;s Anna as Gwalchmei&#x27;s mother. Some Welsh adaptations of the &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; (&quot;Welsh Bruts&quot;), such as the &quot;Brut Tysilio&quot;, also explicitly identify Anna with Gwyar, even using both of these names simultaneously for the wife of Lleu (Lot). Other sources do not follow this substitution, however, indicating that Gwyar and Anna may have originated independently. The &quot;Birth of Arthur&quot; further gives Anna her first husband, Emyr Llydaw (Budic II of Brittany), king of Armorica, by whom she is the mother of Howel (Hoel), and furthermore gives her three daughters by Lleu in addition to the sons Gwalchmei and Medrawd (Mordred).

Thomas Grey&#x27;s Anglo-Norman chronicle &quot;Scalacronica&quot; mentions Arthur&#x27;s &quot;eldest&quot; (not just elder) sister as bestowed by him on Lot. In Alain Bouchart&#x27;s Breton &quot;Grande Croniques de Bretagne&quot;, &quot;Anna or Emine&quot; is Uther&#x27;s eldest child, who there also marries Budic and births Hoel. In Wolfram von Eschenbach&#x27;s romance &quot;Parzival&quot;, Uther&#x27;s daughter Sangîve is first wed to a knight named Florant prior to her later marriage with Lot. Another German poet, Der Pleier, identifies the wife of King Lot and mother of Gawain as Seifê. However, he also names one of Arthur&#x27;s other sisters, Anthonje, as the mother of Gaharet, a figure corresponding to Gawain&#x27;s younger brothers Gaheris and Gareth in other romances, whose father here is an unnamed king of Gritenland. In this and other early works, in addition to Mordred (who not always does appear, especially in the stories dealing with Gawain&#x27;s youth), Gawain is usually given various sisters. He also has a brother named Beacurs in &quot;Parzival&quot;.

The earliest known form of a Morgause-type name is Orcades (&quot;Norcadés&quot;), given to her in the First Continuation of Chrétien de Troyes&#x27; &quot;Perceval&quot; (once attributed to Wauchier de Denain and dated c. 1200). In the works by Chrétien and his continuators, she is the mother of her sons Gawain, Agravain, Gaheris, and Gareth (as listed in &quot;Perceval&quot;), and her varying daughters include Clarissant and Soredamor. &quot;Perceval&quot; and some related romances tell how she lived hidden away in a castle with her mother and at least one daughter until her son Gawain achieved the adventure of the castle (see also Castle of Maidens). As Morcades (&quot;Morchades&quot;, &quot;Orchades&quot;), she also appears in &quot;Les Enfances Gauvain&quot; (early 13th century) and again in Heinrich von dem Türlin&#x27;s &quot;Diu Crône&quot; (c. 1230). It is likely that her name was originally a place name, as &quot;Orcades&quot; coincides with the Latin name for Scotland&#x27;s northern Orkney islands, the lands often described by authors as ruled by Gawain&#x27;s parents (alternatively, their own realm is named Lothian in the south-west coast of Scotland). Medievalist Roger Sherman Loomis suggested that this toponym was corrupted first into the variants of &quot;Morcades&quot; and finally into &quot;Morgause&quot; due to the influence of the name &quot;Morgan&quot;, and also derived her figure from that of the Welsh mythology&#x27;s humanised goddess Dechtire.

In the prose romance tradition considered to have begun with the French &quot;Merlin&quot; by Robert de Boron around 1200 (including the &quot;Vulgate Cycle&quot; and the two non-French romances mentioned above), she is one of a varying number of Arthur&#x27;s half-sisters. Their parents are Gorlois of Tintagel, Duke of Cornwall, and his wife Lady Igraine (the later wife of Uther and mother of Arthur). In Robert&#x27;s original &quot;Merlin&quot;, she appears unnamed (the only named sister is Morgan) and is referred to only as either &quot;King Lot&#x27;s wife&quot; or the &quot;Queen of Orkney&quot; (&quot;Orcanie&quot;). Her version in the vast prose romance &quot;Vulgate Cycle&quot; from the early 13th century is named Brimesent (with manuscript variant &quot;Hermesent&quot;), who in turn is called Belisent in the late 13th-century &quot;Arthour and Merlin&quot; and Albagia in the 15th-century Italian compilation &quot;La Tavola Ritonda&quot;. In the &quot;Post-Vulgate Cycle&quot;, she is never given a name and is referred to only as the Queen of Orkney.

===Malory&#x27;s Morgause and his sources===
Thomas Malory&#x27;s 1485 compilation of Arthurian legends &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, based largely on French prose cycles, Morgause (also &quot;Morgawse&quot; or &quot;Margawse&quot;) is one of three daughters born to Duke Gorlois and Lady Igraine. According to Malory, following his French prose cycles, their mother is widowed by, and then remarried to, Arthur&#x27;s future father, the high king Uther Pendragon. Afterwards, she and her younger sisters, Elaine (called Blasine in &quot;Merlin&quot;) and Morgan (&quot;le Fay&quot;, later the mother of Yvain), now Uther&#x27;s foster daughters, are married off to allies or vassals of their stepfather. The young Morgause is wed to the Orcadian king Lot and bears him four sons, all of whom later go on to serve Arthur as key members of the Knights of the Round Table. They are Gawain, one of Arthur&#x27;s greatest and closest companions with a darker side; Agravain, secretly a wretched and twisted traitor; Gaheris, a skilled fighter but troubled man; and finally the youngest Gareth, a gentle and loving good knight to whom Malory dedicates one of his work&#x27;s eight parts (&quot;The Book of Gareth of Orkney&quot;).

Morgause&#x27;s husband King Lot joins the failed rebellions against Arthur that follow in the wake of King Uther&#x27;s death and the subsequent discovery and coronation of his heir. Acting as a spy during the war, she comes to Carleon, where she visits the boy King Arthur, ignorant of their familial relationship, in his bedchamber, and they conceive Mordred. Her husband, who has unsuspectingly raised Mordred as his own son, is later slain in battle by King Pellinore. All of her sons depart their father&#x27;s court to take service at Camelot, where Gawain and Gaheris avenge Lot&#x27;s death by killing Pellinore, thereby launching a long blood feud between the two families that contributes to bringing the ruin to Arthur&#x27;s kingdom.

Nevertheless, Morgause has an affair with Sir Lamorak, a son of Pellinore and one of Arthur&#x27;s best knights. Once, Lancelot and Bleoberis even find Lamorak and Meleagant fighting over which queen is more beautiful, Morgause or Guinevere. Eventually, her son Gaheris discovers them &quot;in flagrante&quot; together in bed while visiting her castle (the Post-Vulgate&#x27;s castle Rethename in Orkney, near the border with Arthur&#x27;s own Logres). Enraged, he grabs Morgause by her hair and swiftly beheads her, but spares her unarmed lover (who is left naked in bed covered in her blood and is killed later by four Orkney brothers in an unequal fight). Gaheris (who in the Post-Vulgate version defends his act as a just punishment of the queen for her &quot;wretched debauchery&quot;) is consequently banished from the court of Arthur (though he reappears later in the narrative, eventually being slain by Lancelot during the rescue of Guinevere). 

In the Post-Vulgate story, Gaheris&#x27; brothers Gawain and Agravain initially vow to kill him in revenge for their mother&#x27;s death until they are persuaded by Gareth and Bors to end the bloodshed in the family. Arthur buries the Queen of Orkney in the main church in Camelot, inscribing the name of her killer on it, while everyone grieves for her and condemns the &quot;treacherous and cruel&quot; act of Gaheris, including actually even Gaheris himself in his self-exile. In Malory&#x27;s telling, however, Lancelot calls the slaying of Morgause &quot;shameful&quot;, but Gawain seems to be angry at Gaheris only for leaving Lamorak alive at the spot. Her death was first included in the Post-Vulgate &quot;Queste&quot;; Malory used the variant from the Second Version of the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot;.

The act of Mordred&#x27;s conception is described variably in the different works of Arthurian romance. In the Vulgate &quot;Merlin&quot;, the episode takes place earlier, back when a young teenage Arthur was only a mere squire to his foster-brother Kay (prior to the fateful drawing of the sword in the stone) and completely oblivious about his true heritage. During a meeting of the lords of Britain, when King Lot is out hunting, Arthur sneaks into the queen&#x27;s chamber and pretends to be her husband; she eventually discovers the deception but forgives him the next morning and agrees to keep the incident a secret between the two of them. Conversely, a flashback scene in the Post-Vulgate &quot;Merlin Continuation&quot; portrays the Queen of Orkney as entirely aware and willing in her incestuous tryst with her young half-brother.

==Modern fiction==
In modern Arthuriana, Morgause is often turned into a composite character as merged with that of Morgan le Fay; in John Boorman&#x27;s film &quot;Excalibur&quot; (1981), for instance, Morgause&#x27;s role as the mother of Mordred is transferred to &quot;Morgana&quot;. Other modern authors may keep them as separate characters but have Morgause inherit or share Morgan&#x27;s own traits, sometimes even making Morgause a villain opposed to Morgan. According to E. R. Huber, &quot;What becomes clear on reading &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; and its medieval predecessors is that Morgause was not a villain until the modern period.&quot; Some modern authors such as Alfred Tennyson or Howard Pyle use the name Bellicent.

* Morgause is the title character of T.H. White&#x27;s novel &quot;The Queen of Air and Darkness&quot; (1939), the second of four books in his series &quot;The Once and Future King&quot;. She is a widowed witch queen who hates Arthur due to his father killing her father and raping her mother. Morgause raises her children, known as the Orkney clan, to hate the Pendragons for the death of their father. She seduces Arthur through magic, siring Mordred. As in Malory, she is found in bed with Lamorak, but here it is Agravaine who kills her. Due to Mordred being raised by her alone, he is left damaged and hateful, blaming Arthur for his mother&#x27;s death.
* In her &quot;Merlin&quot; novels (1970–1983), Mary Stewart characterizes Morgause unflatteringly as an ambitious and resentful young princess who wants to learn magic from Merlin, but he refuses her. She seduces Arthur in the hope that she can later use it against him.
* A sorceress with authority over dark powers, Morgawse is a central figure in &quot;Hawk of May&quot; (1980) and its sequel, &quot;Kingdom of Summer&quot; (1982), the first two novels in Gillian Bradshaw&#x27;s &quot;Down the Long Wind&quot; series. In &quot;Kingdom of Summer&quot;, she and her husband (&quot;King Lot of The Orcades&quot;) intrigue with King Maelgwn of Gwynedd, whom she takes as a lover. She is eventually magically defeated but spared by her good son and former apprentice Gwalchmai (Gawain) and soon later slain in revenge for her murder of Lot by their other son Agravain, to the despair of her and Arthur&#x27;s son Medraut.
* Marion Zimmer Bradley in her influential novel &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; (1983) and make Morgause a villainous sorceresses who is younger sister of Igraine and Viviane and aunt of the protagonist Morgaine (Morgan). After her niece gives birth to Mordred, Morgause adopts the newborn and rears him for Morgaine, his birth mother, thus assuming her traditional role of mother to Mordred. She was portrayed by Joan Allen in the novel&#x27;s film adaptation (2001).
* She appears in &quot;The Keltiad&quot; series (1984-1998) by American neopagan Patricia Kennealy-Morrison as the evil Marguessan, would-be usurper of the Throne of Scone and an evil twin sister of Morgan.
*Morgause is the main antagonist in &quot;The Squire&#x27;s Tales&quot; series (1998-2010) by Gerald Morris. She is portrayed as the latest incarnation of &quot;the enchantress&quot;, an evil sorceress who wishes to destroy the kings of men. She plots numerous times to kill King Arthur but is foiled in multiple books, however, she successfully seduces Arthur (who does not realize she is his half-sister) and births Mordred. In the final book she is killed by her son Gaheris, which undoes her evil spells.
* A main antagonist in the BBC television series &quot;Merlin&quot; (2008–2012), Morgause is portrayed by actress Emilia Fox as a powerful, Lady Macbeth-like sorceress. She is fiercely loyal to her half-sister Morgana, whom she seeks to make queen of Camelot. She ends up as a willing sacrifice for Morgana.

<doc id="422737" wikidata="Q1515058" url="?curid=422737" title="Island arc">
<text>Island arcs are long chains of active volcanoes with intense seismic activity found along convergent tectonic plate boundaries. Most island arcs originate on oceanic crust and have resulted from the descent of the lithosphere into the mantle along the subduction zone. They are the principal way by which continental growth is achieved.

Island arcs can either be active or inactive based on their seismicity and presence of volcanoes. Active arcs are ridges of recent volcanoes with an associated deep seismic zone. They also possess a distinct curved form, a chain of active or recently extinct volcanoes, a deep-sea trench, and a large negative Bouguer anomaly on the convex side of the volcanic arc. The small positive gravity anomaly associated with volcanic arcs has been interpreted by many authors as due to the presence of dense volcanic rocks beneath the arc. Inactive arcs are a chain of islands which contains older volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks.

The curved shape of many volcanic chains and the angle of the descending lithosphere are related. If the oceanic part of the plate is represented by the ocean floor on the convex side of the arc, and if the zone of flexing occurs beneath the submarine trench, then the deflected part of the plate coincides approximately with the Benioff zone beneath most arcs.

==Location==
Most modern island arcs are near the continental margins (particularly in the northern and western margins of the Pacific Ocean). However, no direct evidence from within the arcs shows that they have always existed at their present position with respect to the continents, although evidence from some continental margins suggests that some arcs may have migrated toward the continents during the late Mesozoic or early Cenozoic.
They are also found at oceanic-oceanic convergence zones, in which case the older plate will subduct under the younger one. 

The movement of the island arcs towards the continent could be possible if, at some point, the ancient Benioff zones dipped toward the present ocean rather than toward the continent, as in most arcs today. This will have resulted in the loss of ocean floor between the arc and the continent, and consequently, in the migration of the arc during spreading episodes.

The fracture zones in which some active island arcs terminate may be interpreted in terms of plate tectonics as resulting from movement along transform faults, which are plate margins where the crust is neither being consumed nor generated. Thus the present location of these inactive island chains is due to the present pattern of lithospheric plates. However, their volcanic history, which indicates that they are fragments of older island arcs, is not necessarily related to the present plate pattern and may be due to differences in position of plate margins in the past.

==Tectonic formation==

Understanding the source of heat that causes the melting of the mantle was a contentious problem. Researchers believed that the heat was produced through friction at the top of the slab. However, this is unlikely because the viscosity of the asthenosphere decreases with increasing temperature, and at the temperatures required for partial fusion, the asthenosphere would have such a low viscosity that shear melting could not occur.

It is now believed that water acts as the primary agent that drives partial melting beneath arcs. It has been shown that the amount of water present in the down-going slab is related to the melting temperature of the mantle. The greater the amount of water present, the more the melting temperature of the mantle is reduced. This water is released during the transformation of minerals as pressure increases, with the mineral carrying the most water being serpentinite.

These metamorphic mineral reactions cause the dehydration of the upper part of the slab as the hydrated slab sinks. Heat is also transferred to it from the surrounding asthenosphere. As heat is transferred to the slab, temperature gradients are established such that the asthenosphere in the vicinity of the slab becomes cooler and more viscous than surrounding areas, particularly near the upper part of the slab. This more viscous asthenosphere is then dragged down with the slab causing less viscous mantle to flow in behind it. It is the interaction of this down-welling mantle with aqueous fluids rising from the sinking slab that is thought to produce partial melting of the mantle as it crosses its wet solidus. In addition, some melts may result from the up-welling of hot mantle material within the mantle wedge. If hot material rises quickly enough so that little heat is lost, the reduction in pressure may cause pressure release or decompression partial melting.

On the subducting side of the island arc is a deep and narrow oceanic trench, which is the trace at the Earth&#x27;s surface of the boundary between the down-going and overriding plates. This trench is created by the downward gravitational pull of the relatively dense subducting plate on the leading edge of the plate. Multiple earthquakes occur along this subduction boundary with the seismic hypocenters located at increasing depth under the island arc: these quakes define the Benioff zone.

Island arcs can be formed in intra-oceanic settings, or from the fragments of continental crust that have migrated away from an adjacent continental land mass or at subduction-related volcanoes active at the margins of continents.

== Features ==

Below are some of the generalized features present in most island arcs.

Fore-arc: This region comprises the trench, the accretionary prism, and the fore-arc basin. A bump from the trench in the oceanward side of the system is present (Barbados in the Lesser Antilles is an example). The fore-arc basin forms between the fore-arc ridge and the island arc; it is a region of undisturbed flat-bedded sedimentation.

Trenches: These are the deepest features of ocean basins; the deepest being the Mariana trench (approximately ). They are formed by flexing of the oceanic lithosphere, developing on the ocean side of island arcs.

Back-arc basin: They are also referred to as marginal seas and are formed in the inner, concave side of island arcs bounded by back-arc ridges. They develop in response to tensional tectonics due to rifting of an existing island arc.

Benioff zone or Wadati-Benioff zone: This is a plane that dips under the overriding plate where intense volcanic activity occurs, which is defined by the location of seismic events below the arc. Earthquakes occur from near surface to ~660 km depth. The dip of Benioff zones ranges from 30° to near vertical.

An ocean basin may be formed between the continental margin and the island arcs on the concave side of the arc. These basins have a crust which is either oceanic or intermediate between the normal oceanic crust and that typical of continents; heat flow in the basins is higher than in normal continental or oceanic areas.

Some arcs, such as the Aleutians, pass laterally into the continental shelf on the concave side of the arc, while most of the arcs are separated from the continental crust.

Movement between two lithospheric plates explains the major features of active island arcs. The island arc and small ocean basin are situated on the overlying plate which meets the descending plate containing normal oceanic crust along the Benioff zone. The sharp bending of the oceanic plate downward produces a trench.

== Volcanic rocks in the island arc ==
There are generally three volcanic series from which the types of volcanic rock that occur in island arcs are formed:

* The &quot;tholeiitic&quot; series – basaltic andesites and andesites.
* The calc-alkaline series – andesites.
* The alkaline series – subgroups of alkaline basalts and the rare, very high potassium-bearing (i.e. shoshonitic) lavas.

This volcanic series is related to the age of the subduction zone and the depth. The tholeiitic magma series is well represented above young subduction zones formed by magma from relative shallow depth. The calc-alkaline and alkaline series are seen in mature subduction zones, and are related to magma of greater depths. Andesite and basaltic andesite are the most abundant volcanic rock in island arc which is indicative of the calc-alkaline magmas. Some Island arcs have distributed volcanic series as can be seen in the Japanese island arc system where the volcanic rocks change from tholeiite—calc-alkaline—alkaline with increasing distance from the trench.

Several processes are involved in arc magmatism which gives rise to the great spectrum of rock composition encountered. These processes are, but not limited to, magma mixing, fractionation, variations in the depth and degree of partial melting and assimilation. Therefore, the three volcanic series results in a wide range of rock composition and do not correspond to absolute magma types or source regions.

<doc id="422740" wikidata="Q4743180" url="?curid=422740" title="American Birding Association">
<text>The American Birding Association (ABA) is a nonprofit organization, founded in 1969, dedicated to recreational birding in Canada and the United States. It has been called &quot;the standard-bearer for serious birding in North America.&quot; Originally concentrated on finding, listing, and identifying rare birds, the ABA now seeks to serve all birders with a wide range of services and publications.

== History ==
In December 1968, in the first issue (volume 0, number 0) of &quot;The Birdwatcher&#x27;s Digest&quot;, Jim Tucker proposed the formation of a group to be known as the &quot;American Birdwatchers&#x27; Association&quot; for the exchange of information and the comparison of birding lists.

On the suggestion of Stuart Keith, the next issue of Tucker&#x27;s newsletter bore the name &quot;Birding&quot; (volume 1, number 1). This January/February 1969 issue 
included a statement of intentions and objectives and three pages of lists, including the birders with the top ten lists for the world and for the area then covered by the checklist of the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union. The organization was renamed the American Birding Association. Expressly excluding conservation advocacy and ornithological research, the ABA&#x27;s initial focus was on the hobby and sport of birding. Through its publications and events, the early ABA sought to connect avid birders, establish rules for listing, and communicate the latest identification techniques. By 1970, the organization had more than 500 members.

The first officers included Keith as president, Arnold Small as vice president, and Tucker as secretary and treasurer. Shortly thereafter, Joseph W. Taylor became treasurer, and Bob Smart joined as second vice president. Benton Basham became membership chairman in 1971, and was responsible for much of the organization&#x27;s growth.

Beginning with volume 3 (1971), &quot;Birding&quot; was redesigned as a magazine; the annual page count increased to 258 from 96 in 1970. The last issue of 1971 introduced a new full-color logo, designed by Guy Tudor, with the image of a red-billed tropicbird.

The ABA held its first convention in 1973 in Kenmare, North Dakota and its second in Leamington, Ontario.

Subsequent presidents of the organization have included Arnold Small (1976-1979), Joseph W. (Joe) Taylor (1979-1983), Lawrence G. (Larry) Balch (1983-1989), and Allan Keith (1989-1993; 1997–1999). As of 2022, Julie Davis is the current board chair and interim president of the ABA.

Membership rose to 6,500 by October 1986 and first exceeded 10,000 in October 1992. The ABA attained a high of 22,000 members in 2001.

A monthly newsletter, &quot;Winging It&quot;, was published from 1989 to 2012. In 1998, the ABA assumed responsibility for the publication of the National Audubon Society&#x27;s journal &quot;Field Notes&quot;, subsequently renamed &quot;North American Birds&quot;. The quarterly &quot;Birder&#x27;s Guide&quot; first appeared in 2013.

In 2000, the ABA assumed management of the Institute for Field Ornithology workshops conducted by the University of Maine at Machias.

The ABA&#x27;s mission has expanded to support conservation and research efforts, beginning with its partnership with Birders&#x27; Exchange, a program supplying research equipment to young scientists in Central and South America. Conservation-oriented content began to appear more frequently in &quot;Birding&quot; with the 2001 volume.

== Publications ==
The ABA publishes three periodical publications, offering them in print and online formats. The ABA also hosts two blogs and a podcast. The ABA partners with and advises Scott &amp; Nix, Inc., publisher of a series of recent and forthcoming &quot;ABA State Guides&quot;. The ABA also publishes a regularly updated checklist and occasional eBooks and monographs.

=== Print publications ===
The ABA publishes &quot;Birding&quot;, its bimonthly magazine; &quot;North American Birds&quot;, the quarterly &quot;journal of record&quot; for North American birdlife; and &quot;Birder&#x27;s Guide&quot;, a quarterly publication with a rotating schedule of themes. All three journals are offered in print and online formats.

The ABA has published bird-finding guides to various states and regions of the United States and the Caribbean (10 titles are in print). The ABA is a partner in the ongoing publication of a series of photographic field guides to the birds of particular states (12 titles).

=== Online publications ===
The ABA maintains a multiauthored blog and a multi-voiced podcast; ABA&#x27;s youth program hosts the blog &quot;The Eyrie&quot;. The ABA&#x27;s journals &quot;Birding&quot;, &quot;North American Birds&quot;, and &quot;Birder&#x27;s Guide&quot; are offered online, as well as in print.

=== ABA Checklist ===

The ABA publishes a checklist of the more than 1000 bird species found in the ABA area (the entirety of the United States and Canada, plus St. Pierre et Miquelon). Updates to the most recent print edition are available online. The Checklist provides the common names established and recommended by the American Ornithological Society, and it is one of the authorities consulted by the compilers of many popular bird identification guides in order to establish ranges and the status of populations.

== Programs ==
The ABA offers birding camps, sponsors youth teams in birding competitions, provides scholarships, and conducts an annual ABA Young Birder of the Year Contest.

Members interested in bird listing share their totals at Listing Central.

The organization promulgates a &quot;Code of Birding Ethics&quot;, guiding birders to protect birds, the environment, and the rights of others.

In addition to offering ABA apparel, the organization has partnered with for-profit companies to sell identification and bird-finding guides, binoculars, and items related to conservation.

The ABA offers birding rallies, tours, and workshops (through the ABA Institute for Field Ornithology) throughout the world. The IFO workshops, established to foster cooperation between professional and amateur ornithologists, blend classroom instruction and field study.

== Awards ==

The ABA presents several awards for promoting the cause of birding, advancing the state of ornithology, and making significant contributions to education and conservation. In 1980, it initiated the Ludlow Griscom Award to recognize &quot;outstanding contributions to excellence in field birding;&quot; it is often called birding&#x27;s highest honor. In 2000, the awards program was expanded to include the Chandler Robbins Award for Education/Conservation, the Claudia Wilds Award for Distinguished Service, and the Roger Tory Peterson Award for Promoting the Cause of Birding. The Robert Ridgway Award for Publications in Field Ornithology was added in 2002. The Griscom Award now specifically recognizes outstanding contributions to regional ornithology.

In 2014, the ABA introduced the Betty Petersen Award for Conservation and Community, to honor &quot;those who have made great strides in expanding, diversifying, and strengthening the birding community, and those who have worked to build a support network for conservation.&quot; The first, posthumous recipient was Betty Petersen. In 2015, the award was granted to Jack Siler; Ann Nightingale received the award in 2016; Judy Pollock was honored in 2017.

<text>Moonspell is a Portuguese gothic metal band formed in 1992. The group released their first EP, &quot;Under the Moonspell&quot;, in 1994 and followed up with their debut album, &quot;Wolfheart&quot;, a year later. They quickly became the most recognizable metal band from Portugal and a key figure in gothic metal. Fernando Ribeiro is co-founder, singer and songwriter of the band.

Moonspell achieved success in Portugal with their 1998 album &quot;Sin/Pecado&quot;. With &quot;Memorial&quot; (2006), the group also became the first Portuguese metal band to have a record certified Gold. They are also popular in Germany, where their albums consistently enter the Top 100 Chart.

== History ==

=== Early days (1992–1994) ===
Although they had been playing since 1989 under the name of &quot;Morbid God&quot;, the band became Moonspell in 1992, shortly after they released the promo track &quot;Serpent Angel&quot;. At the time of the name change, the band&#x27;s line-up was Fernando Ribeiro (Langsuyar) on vocals, João Pedro &quot;Ares&quot; Escoval (Tetragrammaton) on bass, Duarte Picoto (Mantus) and Luís Lamelas (Malah) on the guitars, and Miguel &quot;Mike&quot; Gaspar (Nisroth) on the drums. Ribeiro and Ares were the founders and masterminds of Morbid God / Moonspell, while the latter members joined Morbid God at different points in 1992. Of them, only Mike Gaspar joined after the recording of &quot;Serpent Angel&quot;.

On 24 February 1993, the band released their demo &quot;Anno Satanæ&quot;, which contained three songs accompanied by an intro and an outro. In September, Pedro Paixão joined the band to play keyboards. On 6 November 1993, Moonspell performed their first show in Charneca, Lisbon. Shortly after, Lamelas was fired and replaced by João Pereira (Tanngrisnir). The demo circulated around the black metal scene and eventually attracted the interest of independent label Adipocere Records, which signed the band for a mini-album.

On 27 April 1994, Moonspell released the mini-album &quot;Under the Moonspell&quot; and toured around Portugal to promote it and try to jump to a bigger label. After the release of mini-album &quot;Under the Moonspell&quot;, Moonspell signed with Century Media Records for six albums.

=== Breakthrough (1995–1997) ===
&quot;Wolfheart&quot; was recorded in Germany with producer Waldemar Sorychta and was released on 1 April 1995. By June, João Pereira was struggling with the band&#x27;s breakthrough and his daytime job, and was replaced by Ricardo Amorim, who was asked to join the band on 13 June. Shortly before, Ricardo had been approached by the band to possibly replace João on some shows, but that came to nothing as João was given a second chance.

In July, Moonspell performed three shows in the United Kingdom, their first ones outside Portugal, and in September, the band embarked on a European tour, supporting Morbid Angel. Duarte Picoto told the band he couldn&#x27;t go on the European tour as he was having personal issues of his own, but they went on anyway, as they felt it was too big of an opportunity to throw away, and played as a five-piece. Ricardo, who had joined the band after &quot;Wolfheart&quot;″s release, was then the sole guitarist playing live. Duarte&#x27;s status in the band was on hold during the tour, as the band was initially reluctant about firing him due to his perceived importance on songwriting, but after it, the band felt comfortable as a five-piece and Duarte ended up not being reinstated.

For 1996&#x27;s &quot;Irreligious&quot;, the band again recorded with producer Waldemar Sorychta. While the previous album was considered black metal, this one fell into the genre of gothic metal. The song &quot;Opium&quot; became the first Moonspell single. It quoted one of Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa&#x27;s heteronyms, Álvaro de Campos, on his poem &quot;Opiário&quot;, and its music video featured the character of the poet writing in a bar with the band playing. Along with the release of the album in a convent, the Convento do Beato, there were factors that helped the band sell 10,000 copies of the album in their homeland.

On 7 February 1997, after serious artistic and personal conflicts with the rest of the band, bass player Ares was fired and was replaced by Sérgio Crestana. There were several lawsuits between Ares and Moonspell which were solved in 2004.

=== Experimenting (1998–2000) ===
&quot;Sin/Pecado&quot; (&quot;Without/Sin&quot;; &quot;Pecado&quot; means &quot;sin&quot; in Portuguese) was released in 1998. It had a bigger experimental nature than its predecessors. The song &quot;2econd Skin&quot; was released as a single. At the time they released the one and only Dæmonarch album, &quot;Hermeticum&quot;. Dæmonarch was a side project composed by all Moonspell members except drummer Mike Gaspar. The album was seen as a return to their black metal roots and its lyrics were all written by singer Fernando Ribeiro between the age of 14 and 16.

&quot;Sin/Pecado&quot; was followed in 1999 by &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot;, recorded in London and produced by Andy Reilly. This album is considered to be very experimental in nature as well. Featuring &quot;down-tuned guitar riffs, eerie synthesizer passages&quot;, the album was mainly composed by guitarist/keyboard player Pedro Paixão and was not very well received by metal critics.

=== &quot;Darkness and Hope&quot; and &quot;The Antidote&quot; (2001–2005) ===

&quot;Darkness and Hope&quot; was released in 2001 and was produced by Hiili Hiilesmaa, producer of Sentenced and HIM. The album reached 79th on German charts and special editions included covers of Madredeus, Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Crowley&quot; and Joy Division&#x27;s &quot;Love Will Tear Us Apart&quot;. &quot;Nocturna&quot; was released as a single and music video.

In 2003, the band released &quot;The Antidote&quot;, with Niclas Etelävuori from Amorphis playing as a session musician on the bass guitar, as Sérgio Crestana left the band earlier that year. The album was released with a book with the same title written by Portuguese writer José Luís Peixoto. Both the CD and book share the same concept and story and each song in the CD is sister to a chapter in the book that enhances the story in the lyrics. &quot;Everything Invaded&quot; was released as a single and music video. After the album&#x27;s recording, Moonspell hired Aires Pereira as a touring bass player. The band toured extensively around the world, playing at Rock in Rio Lisbon in 2004, a concert that brought them to more mainstream attention in Portugal.

During 2003 the band recorded a cover of the jazz standard &quot;I&#x27;ll See You in My Dreams&quot; for the soundtrack of the Portuguese short zombie horror film of the same name. There is an official music video which was filmed in one day during the production of the short and under a €2,000 budget. The song was also issued as a single in 2004, featuring the full and edited versions.

=== &quot;Memorial&quot;, &quot;Under Satanæ&quot; and &quot;Night Eternal&quot; (2006–2009) ===
&quot;Memorial&quot; was released in 2006. Recorded with the producer of their first three albums Waldemar Sorychta, who also recorded the bass guitar parts, it was the first to be released under their new label SPV Steamhammer. The album topped the Portuguese album chart on its first week and also broke into the German Top 100 at number 68. Memorial achieved gold status in Portugal after selling 10,000 copies, making Moonspell the first Portuguese doom metal band to achieve that.

Although the album is heavier than the previous, it was very well received and its release was featured in various Portuguese news broadcasts. A new release of the album was released in December 2006 and featured a DVD with live performances and the music videos made for the album. Music videos for &quot;Finisterra&quot; and &quot;Luna&quot; were released.

The band then worked on releasing a DVD originally entitled &quot;Lunar Still/13 Years of Doom&quot;, but had some issues of a legal nature and was forced to delay the release, originally expected in September 2005. It was pushed later to 9 December 2008 with a new title: &quot;Lusitanian Metal&quot;.

On 2 November 2006, Moonspell won an MTV Europe Music Award in the category of Best Portuguese Act.

&quot;The Great Silver Eye&quot;, a best-of album, was released on 26 June 2007.

In 2007, Moonspell released &quot;Under Satanæ&quot;, a re-recording of early songs.

&quot;Night Eternal&quot; was released on 16 May 2008, again with Niclas Etelävuori on bass. The lead single off the album, &quot;Scorpion Flower&quot;, features Dutch singer Anneke van Giersbergen (ex-The Gathering, now Agua De Annique).

Moonspell performed the &quot;Blackest of the Black&quot; tour with Danzig, Winds of Plague, Dimmu Borgir and Skeletonwitch.

Moonspell toured Europe with Cradle of Filth, Gorgoroth, Septicflesh and Asrai (&quot;The Darkest Tour: Filthfest&quot;) in December 2008, and took part in a European tour with Cradle of Filth and Turisas, dubbed the &quot;Darkest Tour:Filthfest 2&quot;, in April and May 2009.

In July 2010 it was reported that the Portuguese Postal Service would release &quot;a collection of stamps that represent the most significant rock moments and records from Portugal,&quot; which included Moonspell&#x27;s first album, &quot;Wolfheart&quot;.

=== &quot;Alpha Noir&quot; and &quot;Omega White&quot;, &quot;Extinct&quot;, &quot;1755&quot;, and &quot;Hermitage&quot; (2010–present) ===
In July 2010, vocalist Fernando Ribeiro revealed the band was working on a new album, which he described as &quot;the most exciting, sexiest, darkest, heaviest and catchiest stuff we&#x27;ve written in ages!&quot;. In December 2011 Moonspell signed with Napalm Records, and Ribeiro released the following statement:
 Around the same time, Aires Pereira was admitted as a full member of the band, after playing live with them for eight years.

In January 2012, Moonspell revealed the title of the new album to be &quot;Alpha Noir&quot;, with a release date of 27 April 2012 and a special edition set to include the album&#x27;s &quot;musical twin&quot;, &quot;Omega White&quot;. The band&#x27;s press release cited Bathory, King Diamond, Onslaught, early Metallica, Testament, and Artillery as influences for &quot;Alpha Noir&quot;, which was described as &quot;an incendiary album&quot;. &quot;Omega White&quot; was instead described as an album of &quot;pure atmosphere and shadow&quot;, an homage to Type O Negative and The Sisters of Mercy and similar to Moonspell&#x27;s second album &quot;Irreligious&quot;. &quot;Alpha Noir&quot; and &quot;Omega White&quot; were both produced and mixed by Tue Madsen, who had previously worked on the band&#x27;s &quot;Under Satanæ&quot; and &quot;Night Eternal&quot; records.

In 2015, Moonspell released a new album titled &quot;Extinct&quot;. This album continued Moonspell&#x27;s trend into darker and more gothic music.

On 3 November 2017, they released a concept album named &quot;1755&quot;. It detailed the story of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, and was sung entirely in Portuguese, apart from some choirs in Latin.

On 3 July 2020, Moonspell announced that Mike Gaspar, the original drummer, had left the band, and that he would be replaced by Hugo Ribeiro.

On 26 February 2021, Moonspell released a new album called &quot;Hermitage&quot;.
