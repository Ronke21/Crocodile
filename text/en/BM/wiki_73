<text>George Foulkes, Baron Foulkes of Cumnock (born 21 January 1942) is a British politician and life peer who served as Minister of State for Scotland from 2001 to 2002. A member of Scottish Labour and the Co-operative Party, he was Member of Parliament (MP) for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, formerly South Ayrshire, from 1979 to 2005. He was later a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP), as one of the additional members for the Lothians region, from 2007 to 2011.

Born in Shropshire in England, Foulkes was educated at Keith Grammar School in Moray and privately at The Haberdashers&#x27; Aske&#x27;s Boys&#x27; School near London, and studied Psychology at the University of Edinburgh. He served as President of the Scottish Union of Students before being elected to City of Edinburgh District Council and Lothian Regional Council. After unsuccessfully contesting Edinburgh West in 1970 and Edinburgh Pentlands in October 1974, he was elected to represent South Ayrshire in parliament at the 1979 general election and to represent Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley at the 1983 general election following boundary changes.

Appointed to the opposition frontbench in 1983, Foulkes served as a shadow Europe minister, shadow foreign and Commonwealth affairs minister and shadow defence minister respectively. He was forced to resign from the latter role in 1993, after striking a police officer and being convicted of being drunk and disorderly. He rejoined the frontbench in 1994 as a shadow overseas aid minister. After the Labour Party won the 1997 general election, he was Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development from 1997 to 2001 and Minister of State for Scotland from 2001 to 2002. He stepped down from the House of Commons at the 2005 general election.

While serving as a delegate to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, Foulkes joined the House of Lords in June 2005 and was appointed to the Privy Council in July. Elected at the 2007 Scottish Parliament election on the Lothians regional list, he was critical of the conduct of the minority Scottish National Party (SNP) government and campaigned for presumed consent for organ donation. He stood down from the Scottish Parliament at the 2011 election. In the Lords, he continued to be loyal to the New Labour government and supported the ongoing Iraq War and proposals for mandatory identity cards. During the 2009 expenses controversy, he accused presenters who questioned MPs&#x27; expenses of undermining democracy. He was a critic of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn for failing to tackle antisemitism in the party and made calls for Richard Leonard to resign as Leader of the Scottish Labour Party.

==Early life and career==
Foulkes was born in Oswestry, Shropshire, and raised in Banffshire, later Moray, where he was educated at the state secondary Keith Grammar School. He later attended the independent, fee-paying Haberdashers&#x27; Aske&#x27;s Boys&#x27; School in West Hampstead. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Psychology from the University of Edinburgh, where he was Senior President of the Students&#x27; Representative Council in 1963. He later became the full-time President of the Scottish Union of Students, after which he was elected as a City of Edinburgh district councillor for the Sighthill ward and then as a member of Lothian Regional Council.

==House of Commons==
Before gaining election to the House of Commons, Foulkes unsuccessfully contested Edinburgh West in 1970, being beaten by the Conservative Party candidate Anthony Stodart. In October 1974, he stood for Edinburgh Pentlands but was beaten by Malcolm Rifkind. He was first elected in the 1979 general election, as Labour and Co-operative Member of Parliament for South Ayrshire. After the constituency&#x27;s abolition in boundary changes, he was elected in the 1983 general election for the new constituency of Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley.

In 1981, Foulkes drafted a political bill called the &quot;Control of Space Invaders (and other Electronic Games) Bill&quot; in an attempt to ban the game for its &quot;addictive properties&quot; and for causing &quot;deviancy&quot;. The bill was debated and only narrowly defeated in parliament by 114 to 94 votes. He introduced the first-ever proposals for a smoking ban in public places in 1982 and legislation against age discrimination in 1985, both through private member&#x27;s bills. A supporter of Scottish devolution, he was involved in the drafting of &quot;A Claim of Right for Scotland&quot; in 1988.

After serving on the Foreign Affairs Select Committee and Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, Foulkes was appointed to the Opposition frontbench in 1983, serving as a shadow Europe minister and later a shadow foreign and Commonwealth affairs minister. In 1992, he was made Shadow Minister for Defence, Disarmament and Arms Control. He was forced to resign in 1993, after being convicted of being drunk and disorderly during an incident in which he struck a police officer. He returned to the frontbench in 1994, serving as deputy to Overseas Aid spokespersons Joan Lestor and Clare Short until 1997.

When Labour won the general election in 1997, Foulkes was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the new Department for International Development. He was then Minister of State for Scotland from 2001 until a May 2002 cabinet reshuffle. He stepped down from the House of Commons at the 2005 general election.

==House of Lords==

On 13 May 2005, it was announced that Foulkes was to receive a life peerage. On 16 June 2005, he was created Baron Foulkes of Cumnock, &quot;of Cumnock in East Ayrshire&quot;. He was made a member of the Privy Council in July of that year. He continued to be an &quot;ultra loyalist&quot; to the 1997–2010 Labour government. He was a strong supporter of 2006 government proposals for mandatory identity cards. He also continued to support the Iraq War and described Tony Blair&#x27;s conduct of the war as clearly intentioned, carried through brilliantly and resulting in much improvement for the people of Iraq. Commenting on Sir Christopher Meyer&#x27;s testimony to the Iraq Inquiry in 2009, he described the inquiry as &quot;a procession of primadonnas and the usual suspects grandstanding for the TV&quot;.

Foulkes was a member of the Intelligence and Security Committee in the Cabinet Office from 2007 to 2010 and the Joint Committee on National Security Strategy from 2010 to 2015. He serves on the Executive Committee of the Inter-Parliamentary Union and the Board of Governors of the Westminster Foundation for Democracy. Since March 2011, he has been a member of the Lords EU Select Committee and Lords EU Sub Committee on Social Policy and Consumer Protection.

Foulkes is very active on Caribbean matters, serving as president of the Caribbean Council, chair of the Belize and Dominican Republic All-Party Parliamentary Groups (APPGs), and vice-chair of the Trinidad and Tobago and British–Central America APPGs. He is also a member of Labour Friends of Israel.

In April 2008, Foulkes was criticised for his expenses claims. Between April 2007 and March 2008, he claimed £54,527 in expenses from the House of Lords but, in January 2009, was shown to have one of the lowest expenses claims in the Scottish Parliament. During the 2009 expenses controversy, he attacked media presenters in an exchange with the BBC&#x27;s Carrie Gracie. He said some presenters, such as Jeremy Paxman and John Humphrys, were being paid to &quot;sneer at democracy and undermine democracy&quot;. However, in August 2009, Foulkes made a series of Freedom of Information requests about the expenses of retiring British Army head General Sir Richard Dannatt. He was accused by Shadow Defence Secretary Liam Fox of leading a New Labour smear campaign.

Foulkes was one of the fifty signatories to a letter published in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2010, which called for Pope Benedict XVI not to be given a state visit to the UK, and accused the Catholic Church of increasing the spread of Aids and promoting segregated education. On 24 August 2011, &quot;The Scotsman&quot; reported that he had announced he would table an amendment to the Scotland Bill with the intention to make it impossible for the Scottish Government to sustain free university education for students in Scotland. On 2 February 2012, he tabled a motion calling for the Scottish independence referendum to contain no extra question on increased devolution, and proposing a separate referendum be held on the subject in the event independence were rejected and Scotland voted to stay in the UK.

Foulkes in July 2019 was among 67 Labour peers to lend their names to an unauthorised advertisement in &quot;The Guardian&quot; which criticised Jeremy Corbyn for failing to effectively tackle antisemitism in the party. In August, he said Richard Leonard and Lesley Laird should resign as Leader and Deputy Leader of the Scottish Labour Party respectively, accusing Leonard of having &quot;no charisma and no leadership credentials&quot; and saying &quot;almost anyone would be better&quot; than Laird. He repeated calls for Leonard to resign in July 2020.

==Scottish Parliament==

Foulkes returned to electoral politics in 2007 when he was first on Scottish Labour&#x27;s Lothians regional list in the 2007 Scottish Parliament election. He appeared in place of leader Jack McConnell on a February 2007 &quot;Question Time&quot; special and accused Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond of acting in a &quot;xenophobic way&quot; for saying Gordon Brown was an example of &quot;London Labour&quot;. Former Scottish Labour leader Henry McLeish joined others calling on Foulkes to apologise for the claim. He was elected as a Member of the Scottish Parliament on 3 May 2007. After his election, he appeared on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Scotland at Ten&quot; radio program and criticised the SNP for &quot;trying to build up a situation in Scotland where the services are manifestly better than south of the border in a number of areas&quot; in an interview. When asked by presenter Colin Mackay &quot;Is that a bad thing?&quot;, Foulkes responded, &quot;No, but they are doing it deliberately.&quot;

In the Scottish Parliament, Foulkes was part of Labour&#x27;s opposition to the minority SNP government, regularly tabling parliamentary questions criticising the Scottish Government&#x27;s conduct. He highlighted several supposed irregularities, including the taxpayer-funded entertaining of wealthy SNP backers at Bute House and preferential treatment for Stagecoach in the Forth hovercraft project, after their co-founder Brian Souter donated £500,000 to the SNP. Foulkes became a target of criticism by SNP bloggers, whom he branded &quot;Cybernats&quot;. He was also part of a campaign for presumed consent on organ donation.

Foulkes did not seek re-election in the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, with the Lothian list instead returning Sarah Boyack, Neil Findlay and Kezia Dugdale. Dugdale had previously served as his constituency agent and would go on to become Leader of the Scottish Labour Party.

== Council of Europe ==
In June 2003, Tony Blair appointed Foulkes as a UK delegate to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and Assembly of the Western European Union.

In January 2022, Foulkes and four other Labour delegates tabled ten amendments to Resolution 2417, &quot;Combating rising hate against LGBTI people in Europe&quot;. The amendments sought to include the word &quot;sex&quot; alongside gender identity, de-conflate the situation in the UK from Hungary, Poland, Russia and Turkey, and remove references to alleged anti-LGBTI movements in the UK. The delegates received both praise and criticism.

== Personal life ==
Foulkes married his wife Elizabeth Anna Hope in 1970 and they have two sons and one daughter together. He was chairman of Heart of Midlothian football club from April 2004 until his resignation in October 2005. He resigned in protest at the majority shareholder Vladimir Romanov dismissing Hearts chief executive Phil Anderton. He later failed to be elected Rector of the University of Edinburgh on 12 February 2009, securing 31% of the vote to the 69% taken by Iain Macwhirter.

<text>David Hywel Francis (6 June 1946 – 14 February 2021) was a British politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Aberavon from 2001 to 2015. A member of the Labour Party, he chaired the Welsh Affairs Committee from 2005 to 2010 and the Joint Committee on Human Rights from 2010 to 2015.

== Background ==
Hywel Francis attended Whitchurch Grammar School and Llangatwg Secondary School. He studied at the University of Wales, Swansea, where he earned a doctorate in history. Francis continued to work at the University of Wales as a professor in Adult Continuing Education before being elected in 2001. At the University of Wales, he founded the South Wales Miners&#x27; Library. He also was the chair of the Wales Congress in Support of Mining Communities. Francis was a speaker of the Welsh language.

Francis was a member of the Gorsedd Cymru from 1986. He was made vice-president of Carers UK and honorary parliamentary patron of the adult learners&#x27; body, NIACE. He was a trustee of the Paul Robeson Wales Trust and the Bevan Foundation he founded. He was the South Wales Miners&#x27; Museum president. He authored many peer-reviewed articles, book chapters, and several books. His books include: (co-author, Dai Smith) in 1980 (reprinted in 1998); in 1984; in 1999; in 2009; and (co-author, Siân Williams) in 2013. Francis is featured in the documentary film &quot;After Coal&quot;.

He was the son of Dai Francis, who led the South Wales NUM during the industrial unrest of the 1970s. Like his father, he had been a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain.

== Political career ==
In 1999, Francis became a special adviser to Paul Murphy, the Secretary of State for Wales; Murphy worked in this position until 2000. The following year, he was elected to the House of Commons. He was re-elected in May 2005. He was the chair of the Welsh Affairs Select Committee from 2005 to 2010; chair of the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on Archives and History, formerly chair of the APPG on Steel and Cast Metal; and chair of the All-Party Carers Group.

Francis voted in favour of a bill that banned smoking in restaurants in April 2003. In December 2004 and October 2005, he voted in favour of the Identity Cards Bill. In March 2002, he voted to ban the hunting of wild mammals with dogs. He voted in favour of the NHS foundation trust proposal. He also voted in favour of allowing unmarried heterosexual and homosexual couples to adopt, and in favour of the Civil Partnership Bill. Francis voted in favour of the replacement of the Trident system.

He voted in favour of adding clauses to a bill that allow the Secretary of State to detain indefinitely, pending deportation, anyone he suspects is a terrorist, even if the law forbids that person&#x27;s deportation from ever taking place. He voted against only allowing people detained at a police station to be fingerprinted and searched for an identifying birthmark if it is in connection with a terrorism investigation. He voted against changing the text in the Prevention of Terrorism Bill from &quot;The Secretary of State may make a control order against an individual&quot; to &quot;The Secretary of State may for a control order [...]&quot;.

In March 2003, he voted that the case had not yet been made for war against Iraq. In June 2003, he voted against a motion that would have recalled the Prime Minister&#x27;s assertion that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction that could be used at 45 minutes&#x27; notice, and against launching an independent inquiry into the intelligence received and the decisions that were based on it. In June 2007, he voted against a motion calling for an independent inquiry by a committee of privy counsellors into the Iraq War.

Francis fought against the closing of Port Talbot&#x27;s magistrates and the moving of administrative posts to other locations, saying, &quot;Local justice needs to take place in a local setting.&quot; He suggested that Wales could have a carers&#x27; commissioner based on the Children&#x27;s Commissioner for Wales.

In February 2011, it was reported that Francis had been quoted in a leaked US diplomatic cable. The cable by a US embassy political officer dated from 2008 and discussed the upcoming Welsh Labour leadership election to choose a successor to the retiring Rhodri Morgan. Francis was quoted as claiming that all of the prospective candidates who were already members of the Welsh Assembly were seen as flawed by the Welsh Labour Party and suggesting that many in the party were hoping for a &quot;white knight&quot; to be &quot;parachute[d] in&quot; from outside the Assembly. However, Francis claimed that he could not recall the conversation, suggesting that &quot;it sounds as if the diplomat suffers from poor shorthand&quot; and stating that &quot;it is on the record that I was an early supporter of Carwyn Jones [...] I would certainly not have supported such an absurd suggestion as parachuting anyone into the assembly&quot;.

On 22 November 2013, Francis announced he would be standing down as MP for Aberavon at the 2015 general election. Stephen Kinnock, son of former Labour leader Neil Kinnock, was selected to succeed Francis as the Labour candidate for Aberavon.

== Personal life ==
Francis married Mair Price in 1968. They had a son with Down syndrome, who died aged 16 in 1997 of a heart condition.

He died aged 74 from cancer on 14 February 2021, at Morriston Hospital in Swansea, Wales. Francis is survived by his wife and two children.

<text>Mark Gino Francois (; born 14 August 1965) is a British politician who has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Rayleigh and Wickford since 2001. A member of the Conservative Party, he has been Shadow Minister for Defence since 2024.

Francois served as Vice-Chamberlain of the Household (2010–2012), a Minister of State at the Ministry of Defence (2012–2013) and Minister of State for the Armed Forces (2013–2015). He was also Minister of State for Communities and Resilience and Minister for Portsmouth at the Department for Communities and Local Government from 2015 to 2016.

In 2018, he was appointed deputy chair and &quot;de facto&quot; whip of the eurosceptic European Research Group (ERG) by chair Jacob Rees-Mogg. He was a critic of the leadership of Theresa May during her time as leader of the Conservative Party. 

In March 2020 he became the Chair of the ERG.

==Early life and career==
Mark Gino Francois was born on 14 August 1965 in Islington, London to Anna (&quot;&quot; Carloni) and Reginald Francois. His father was an engineer and his mother was an Italian au pair. The family moved to Basildon in 1971. His secondary education was at the Nicholas Comprehensive School (now part of James Hornsby School). He studied history at the University of Bristol and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in 1986. Francois stated that he joined the Conservative Party when he was studying in Bristol. He went on to undertake a Master of Arts (MA) degree in war studies at King&#x27;s College London, graduating in 1987.

In 1983, whilst at university, he joined the Territorial Army (TA), the part-time reserve force of the British Army. Given the service number 523962, Francois was commissioned as a second lieutenant (on probation) on 18 December 1985. On 1 February 1988, he transferred from the general list to the Royal Anglian Regiment. His commission was confirmed in 1988, and he was granted seniority in the rank of second lieutenant from 18 December 1983. He was promoted lieutenant on 18 September 1988, with seniority in that rank from 18 December 1985. He left the Territorial Army on 21 September 1989.

After university, Francois became a management trainee with Lloyds Bank. He then worked as a political consultant for the lobbying company Market Access International in 1988, leaving to set up his own lobbying firm, Francois Associates, in 1996, which he closed when he was elected as an MP in 2001.

He was a member of Basildon District Council for the Langdon Hills ward from 1991 to 1995. On the council, he served as vice-chair of the housing committee from 1992 to 1995.

==Parliamentary career==
Francois stood for the Brent East constituency in the 1997 general election, coming second to the incumbent, Labour&#x27;s Ken Livingstone. Francois contested the election to be the Conservatives&#x27; prospective parliamentary candidate for Kensington and Chelsea in the 1999 by-election. The contest was won by Michael Portillo, who garnered 60% of the final ballot.

He was selected as the party&#x27;s candidate for Rayleigh in the 2001 general election. Francois won the seat with a majority of 8,290. He made his maiden speech on 4 July 2001. Francois was re-elected in the 2005 general election with an increased majority of 14,726.

He served as a member of the Environmental Audit Select Committee for the duration of his first term in Parliament. He was promoted to become an Opposition Whip in 2003 by Michael Howard; to Shadow Economic Secretary in May 2004; and later to Shadow Paymaster General (10 May 2005 – 3 July 2007) scrutinising HMRC.

He was promoted to be Shadow Minister for Europe on 3 July 2007, and joined the Shadow Cabinet at the January 2009 reshuffle. As Shadow Minister for Europe Francois oversaw the Conservative Party&#x27;s withdrawal from the EPP grouping in the European Parliament, the creation of the ECR grouping and the Conservatives&#x27; opposition in the House of Commons to the Treaty of Lisbon, which he spoke against on many occasions including on 5 March 2008 in the debate to pass the European Union (Amendment) Act 2008.

When the Rayleigh constituency was abolished, Francois was elected in the new seat of Rayleigh &amp; Wickford in the 2010 general election. Francois won with a majority of 22,338 votes, 42.7%, receiving 57.8% of all the votes cast.

When the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats joined in a coalition government following the 2010 general election, he was appointed Vice-Chamberlain of the Household, a sinecure given to a Government Whip that entails being kept as &#x27;captive&#x27; at Buckingham Palace when the Queen opens Parliament. He joined the Privy Council on 9 June 2010. In 2011, he was a member of the special Select Committee set up to scrutinise the Bill that became the Armed Forces Act 2011.

He was appointed Minister of State for Defence Personnel, Welfare and Veterans in the Ministry of Defence in September 2012. From October 2013 to May 2015, he was Minister of State with responsibility for the armed forces, cyber activity, and force generation.

At the 2015 general election, Francois was re-elected as the MP for Rayleigh and Wickford with a reduced majority of 17,230 votes. Following the election, he became Minister of State for Communities and Resilience and Minister for Portsmouth at the Department for Communities and Local Government.

Francois left the government after Theresa May was appointed prime minister, but she appointed him to conduct a review into the use of reserves in the Army.

At the 2017 general election, Francois was re-elected as the MP for Rayleigh and Wickford with an increased majority of 23,450 votes.

Since September 2017, Francois has sat on the Defence Select Committee and is a former member of the Administration Committee, the Committee of Selection, Defence Committee and Environmental Audit Committee. He is a vice-president of Conservative Friends of Poland.

In September 2019, Essex Police issued clarification on Francois&#x27; status, when he joined one of their patrols in a Rayleigh, Essex Wetherspoons pub in his capacity as the local MP. He appeared to be dressed as a uniformed police officer, including wearing a police issue stab vest. Essex Police said that they had wrongly issued the jacket to the MP and confirmed that Francois is not employed by them. They used the statement to add that they are however currently recruiting.

In 2019, Francois became one of the 28 so called Tory &quot;Brexit Spartans&quot; who voted against Theresa May&#x27;s Brexit deal all three times it was put to the House of Commons.

At the 2019 general election, Francois was re-elected with an increased majority of exactly 31,000 and achieved 72.6% of the vote. In January 2020, he launched a crowdfunding bid with the StandUp4Brexit group to raise money for Big Ben to chime upon the UK&#x27;s departure from the EU.

On 3 March 2020, Francois was announced as chair of the ERG, succeeding Steve Baker. In this capacity he wrote to Michel Barnier, head of the task force negotiating the post-Brexit relationship between the UK and the EU, a letter titled &quot;A Missive from a Free Country&quot;. Barnier replied in an open letter.

In December 2021, Francois called on Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis to resign for failing to come through with promised legislation related to veterans.

In November 2022, Labour MP Sarah Owen criticised Francois for using an &quot;outdated and crass racial slur&quot; in the House of Commons when he referred to Japanese people as &quot;Japs&quot;. Francois used the term when asking a question on defence, saying: &quot;Given the defence budget is likely to come under great pressure, why does it take BAE Systems eleven years to build a ship the Japs can build in four?&quot; Francois later said he was complimenting the Japanese shipbuilding industry and used &quot;Japs&quot; as an abbreviation for Japanese.

Francois was again re-elected at the 2024 general election, with a decreased vote share of 37% and a decreased majority of 5,621. 

==Personal life==
Francois married Karen Thomas at Langdon Hills, Basildon, in June 2000. They divorced in 2006.

On 11 June 2022, Francois married Olivia Sanders, a NHS radiographer, borough councillor, and former Conservative Mayor of Brentwood.

<doc id="421647" wikidata="Q538583" url="?curid=421647" title="Jane McCrea">
<text>Jane McCrea (c. 1752 – July 27, 1777) was an American woman who was killed by a Native American warrior serving alongside a British Army expedition under the command of John Burgoyne during the American Revolutionary War. Engaged to a Loyalist officer serving under Burgoyne, her death led to widespread outrage in the Thirteen Colonies and was used by Patriots as part of their anti-British propaganda campaign.

Born in Bedminster, New Jersey, McCrea moved to Saratoga, New York where she became engaged to David Jones, a Loyalist. When the Revolutionary War broke out, Jones fled to Quebec while McCrea&#x27;s brothers divided their loyalties between the British and the Patriots. During the Saratoga campaign of 1777, McCrea left her brother&#x27;s home to join Jones who was stationed in Fort Ticonderoga. While staying at Fort Edward, McCrea was abducted, killed and scalped by a group of Native American warriors.

Upon receiving word of the incident, Burgoyne attempted to punish the culprit but was dissuaded from doing so. Her death was widely reported on throughout the Thirteen Colonies; historians and journalists frequently embellished the incident. The killing of McCrea also inspired American resistance to the British, contributing to the failure of the Saratoga campaign. McCrea&#x27;s life and death eventually became part of American folklore, with pantomimes, poems, folk songs and novels being written about her. Her body has been exhumed numerous times since her death.

==Life==
Jane McCrea was born in Bedminster, New Jersey, one of the younger children in the large family of Rev. James McCrea. After her mother died and her father remarried, McCrea moved in with her brother John who lived near Saratoga, New York, where she eventually became engaged to David Jones. When the American Revolutionary War broke out, two of her brothers joined the Continental Army and three others became Loyalists, while her fiancé fled to Quebec, which was under British control. During the summer of 1777, as British Army officer John Burgoyne&#x27;s expedition neared the Hudson River, John (who by now was serving as a colonel in the Albany County militia) took up service in the 13th Albany County Militia Regiment. Jones, on the other hand, was serving as a lieutenant in a Loyalist militia unit accompanying Burgoyne&#x27;s expedition, and was stationed at Fort Ticonderoga after the British captured it from the Americans.

Around the same time, McCrea left her brother&#x27;s home to join her fiancé at Fort Ticonderoga. She eventually reached Fort Edward on July 1777. McCrea stayed at the home of Loyalist Sara McNeil, who was a cousin of British Army officer Simon Fraser. On the morning of July 27, a group of Native Americans fighting on the side of the British - led by a Wyandot warrior known as Le Loup or Wyandot Panther - killed a settler and his family, then ambushed and killed Lieutenant Tobias Van Vechten (who was serving under John McCrea) and four others in the vicinity of Fort Edward. What happened next is the subject of dispute; what is known is that Jane McCrea and Sarah McNeil were abducted by the Native Americans and separated. McNeil was eventually taken to Burgoyne&#x27;s camp, where either she or David Jones recognized McCrea&#x27;s supposedly distinctive scalp being carried by a Native American warrior.

One account of McCrea&#x27;s death was given by British explorer Thomas Anburey. Anburey claimed that two Native American warriors, one of them Le Loup, were escorting McCrea to Burgoyne&#x27;s camp when they started to quarrel over an expected reward for bringing her there. One of the pair then killed and scalped her, and Le Loup ended up with the scalp. Anburey also claimed that she was taken against her will, though he noted that there were also rumors that she was being escorted at her fiancé&#x27;s request. A second account of her death, given by Le Loup while he was questioned by the British, was that McCrea was killed by American forces stationed at Fort Edward firing at the attacking Native Americans while they were retreating. Historian James Phinney Baxter supported the second account in his work &quot;The British Invasion from the North&quot; (1887) where he asserted that an exhumation of her body revealed only bullet wounds and no tomahawk wounds. Salem, New York historians wrote in 1896, &quot;Jane McCrea made her visit to Mrs. McNeill, of Fort Edward. While at the home of Mrs. McNeill the house was attacked by a band of Indians. Jane and Mrs. McNeill were violently seized and carried off, Jane being placed upon a horse Mrs. McNeill being dragged along on foot. The Indians were hotly pursued by a band of Americans from the fort, who occasionally discharged their rifles at the flying fugitives. Jane was shot through the body by one of these stray bullets, and, falling from her horse, she was scalped by one of her captors and left dead upon the ground.&quot; McCrea&#x27;s death was also reported by American surgeon John Bartlett, who claimed McCrea and McNeil were taken by the Native Americans to Burgoyne&#x27;s camp, where McCrea was shot and scalped.

==Reaction to McCrea&#x27;s death==
When Burgoyne received news of McCrea&#x27;s death, he went to the camp of Native American warriors accompanying his expedition and ordered that the culprit be delivered to him, threatening to have him executed. Simor Fraser and interpreter Luc de la Corne informed Burgoyne that such an act would result in the defection of all Native American warriors from his expedition and might lead them to take revenge as they travelled back north. Burgoyne relented, and no action was taken against the Native Americans with regards to this incident.

Although McCrea had been a loyalist, and was believed to have been killed by a loyalist warrior, the murder and mutilation of an American young woman inflamed both outrage and anxiety among the colonialist population. News of McCrea&#x27;s death travelled relatively quickly around the Thirteen Colonies by the standards of the time. News accounts of her death were published in Pennsylvania on August 11 and as far away as Virginia on August 22. The accounts of her death become increasingly exaggerated as they travelled, claiming that indiscriminate massacres of Loyalists and Patriots were being perpetrated by Native Americans. Burgoyne&#x27;s campaign had intended to use Native Americans as a means to intimidate the colonists; however, the American reaction to the news was not what he had hoped for. Patriot propaganda efforts received a boost after Burgoyne wrote a letter to Continental Army officer Horatio Gates, complaining about the American treatment of prisoners of war captured at the Battle of Bennington on August 17. Gates&#x27; response was widely reprinted:

 That the savages of America should in their warfare mangle and scalp the unhappy prisoners who fall into their hands is neither new nor extraordinary; but that the famous Lieutenant General Burgoyne, in whom the fine gentleman is united with the soldier and the scholar, should hire the savages of America to scalp europeans and the descendants of europeans, nay more, that he should pay a price for each scalp so barbarously taken, is more than will be believed in England. [...] Miss McCrae, a young lady lovely to the sight, of virtuous character and amiable disposition, engaged to be married to an officer of your army, was [...] carried into the woods, and there scalped and mangled in the most shocking manner [...] 

News accounts of her death elaborated on McCrea&#x27;s supposed beauty, describing her as &quot;lovely in disposition, so graceful in manners and so intelligent in features, that she was a favorite of all who knew her&quot;, and that her hair &quot;was of extraordinary length and beauty, measuring a yard and a quarter&quot;. One of the few contemporary accounts of the incident by someone who actually saw her personally was that of James Wilkinson, who described her as &quot;a country girl of honest family in circumstances of mediocrity, without either beauty or accomplishments&quot;. Later accounts frequently embellished details. For example, historian Richard Ketchum notes that the color of her hair has been described as everything from black to blonde to red; he also cited an 1840s examination of an alleged lock of her hair that described it as &quot;reddish&quot;.

Her death, and those of others in similar raids, inspired American resistance to Burgoyne&#x27;s expedition, contributing to his defeat at the battles of Saratoga. The effect expanded as reports of the incident were used as propaganda to excite Patriot sympathies later in the war, especially before the 1779 Sullivan Expedition. David Jones, apparently bitter over the incident, never married and settled in British North America as a United Empire Loyalist.

The story eventually became a part of American folklore. An anonymous poet wrote &quot;The Ballad of Jane McCrea&quot;, which was set to music and became a popular folk song. In Philadelphia in 1799, Ricketts&#x27; Circus performed &quot;The Death of Miss McCrea&quot;, a pantomime co-written by John Durang. Artist John Vanderlyn painted a depiction of her death in 1805. There are several markers in and near Fort Edward commemorating her death.

Reactions to, and artistic recreations of, McCrea&#x27;s death extended into the 1830s, by which time the narrative surrounding McCrea&#x27;s death shifted from being a call for retribution to a celebration of the endurance and triumph of white civilizaton. Showman George Mastin presented a series of oil paintings, one including the murder of Jane McCrea, in a series of traveling shows across upstate New York.

==Exhumations==
McCrea&#x27;s remains have been moved three times. The first time was in 1822, and the second was in 1852, when they were moved to the Union Cemetery in Fort Edward. Her body was exhumed again in 2003 in hopes of solving the mystery of how she died. Unexpectedly, two bodies—those of McCrea and Sara McNeil—were found in the grave. The 1822 move had placed McCrea&#x27;s remains atop the burial vault of McNeil (who died in 1799 of natural causes). Both skeletons were largely complete, though McCrea&#x27;s skull was missing, possibly due to reported grave robberies in the 19th century. The bodies were exhumed again in 2005 for further analysis, and were subsequently reburied in separate graves.

<doc id="421648" wikidata="Q4767446" url="?curid=421648" title="Anna Roosevelt Halsted">
<text>Anna Eleanor Roosevelt Halsted (May 3, 1906 – December 1, 1975) was an American writer who worked as a newspaper editor and in public relations. Halsted also wrote two children&#x27;s books published in the 1930s. She was the eldest child and only daughter of U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. Halsted assisted her father as his advisor during World War II.

She worked with her second husband Clarence John Boettiger at the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot;, serving as editor of the women&#x27;s pages for several years. Halsted later worked in public relations for universities. In 1963, John F. Kennedy appointed her to the Citizen&#x27;s Advisory Council on the Status of Women. She also served for several years as vice-chairman of the President&#x27;s Commission for the Observance of Human Rights.

== Biography ==
=== Early life and marriages ===
Anna Eleanor Roosevelt Jr. was born at 125 East 36th Street in New York City. She was named for her mother, Anna Eleanor Roosevelt, and maternal grandmother, Anna Rebecca Hall. She graduated from Miss Chapin&#x27;s School in 1924. She then entered Cornell University for a short course in forestry. On June 5, 1926, she married Curtis Bean Dall, a New York stockbroker, in Hyde Park, New York. They had two children, Anna Eleanor, born March 25, 1927, and Curtis Roosevelt, born April 19, 1930. The Dalls were divorced in July 1934, and Anna returned to her family, living in the White House. She then married Clarence John Boettiger, a journalist she met on her father&#x27;s campaign train, in March 1935. They had one son, John Roosevelt Boettiger, born March 30, 1939.

=== Early career ===
Anna was active as an editor and journalist. Between 1932 and 1934 she was associate editor of a magazine called &quot;Babies Just Babies;&quot; hosted a radio program sponsored by Best and Company Department Store; and contributed articles to &quot;Liberty&quot; magazine. She also wrote two children&#x27;s books, &quot;Scamper&quot; and &quot;Scamper&#x27;s Christmas&quot;. After her second marriage, she moved to Seattle with her husband, where he was hired by William Randolph Hearst to be the editor of the &quot;Seattle Post Intelligencer.&quot; From December 1936 to September 1943 they ran the newspaper. Anna was editor of the women&#x27;s page and a columnist for the newspaper. In 1942, Clarence Boettiger became concerned he was not doing his part for the war effort. He was given a leave of absence by Hearst and was appointed a captain in the Army.

=== Work in the White House and the Yalta Conference ===
After her husband joined the Army, and at her ailing father&#x27;s request, Anna moved into the White House with her five-year-old son in 1944. Among other duties, she often served as hostess of the White House due to her mother&#x27;s preference for devoting her time to other political activities and worthy causes. She also served as an unofficial secretary to her father. Her responsibilities included answering mail, arranging appointments, and writing presidential speeches. She became alarmed at the obvious deterioration of the President&#x27;s health and insisted on seeking the advice of a cardiologist. When he was diagnosed with congestive heart failure, she was the only family member who was informed. She petitioned to be included in the Yalta Conference as his aide-de-camp, believing that she could best protect her father, seeing to it that he followed the doctor&#x27;s orders of diet and rest. She attended the conference, along with Sarah Churchill, daughter of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Kathy Harriman, daughter of W. Averell Harriman, Ambassador to Russia. The conference lasted from February 2, 1945, to February 11, 1945. Anna was important to Roosevelt both personally and as aide-de-camp.

Anna Boettiger was a witness to many historic moments, but she also carried the burden of dealing with some of the most intimate and painful decisions of her parents during their unconventional marriage. After her father&#x27;s death, Anna had to tell her mother that FDR had been with his long-time mistress, Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd. In addition, she told her that Franklin had continued the relationship for decades, and people surrounding him had hidden it from Eleanor.

=== Subsequent career and marriage ===

After Roosevelt&#x27;s death in April 1945, William Randolph Hearst no longer had reason to favor Boettiger and they had a falling out. Boettiger left the &quot;Seattle Post Intelligencer&quot; and he and Anna bought a weekly newspaper in Phoenix, Arizona. They renamed it the &quot;Arizona Times&quot; and had turned it into a daily paper by May 1947. However, they were attempting to turn it into a left-leaning newspaper in Arizona, and the paper failed. The failure left the Boettigers bankrupt and put a great strain on their marriage. They divorced August 1, 1949. For a year after her divorce, she and Eleanor collaborated on a joint radio show called the &quot;Eleanor and Anna Roosevelt Program&quot;. She also edited a magazine called &quot;The Woman&quot; and contributed a series of articles called &quot;My Life with F.D.R.&quot;

In 1952 she married Dr. James Halsted, a doctor who was employed by the Veterans&#x27; Administration. They moved to New York where she took up work in public relations for hospitals and medical centers. The Halsteds moved to the Imperial State of Iran, where Halsted helped establish the Pahlavi University Medical School. Anna worked there in public relations and administration. When they returned to the United States, Anna immersed herself in humanitarian work and contributed to the legacy of both her parents.

In October 1963, Anna was appointed by President John F. Kennedy to the Citizen&#x27;s Advisory Council on the Status of Women. In February of that year, she was appointed vice-chairman of the President&#x27;s Commission for the Observance of Human Rights.

In 1971, the Halsteds retired to a cottage in Hillsdale, New York. Anna continued to be active in most of the same organizations until her death from throat cancer on December 1, 1975, aged 69, at Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx, New York.

<doc id="421655" wikidata="Q3565888" url="?curid=421655" title="Origins of Czechoslovakia">
<text>The creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918 was the culmination of the long struggle of the Czechs against their Austrian rulers and of the Slovaks against Magyarization and their Hungarian rulers.

==Early history ==
The ancestors of the Czechs and the Slovaks were united in the so-called Samo&#x27;s Empire for about 30 years in the 7th century. The ancestors of
the Slovaks and the Moravians were later united in Great Moravia between 833 and 907. The Czechs were part of Great Moravia for only about seven years before they split from it in 895. Furthermore, in the second half of the 10th century, the Czechs conquered and controlled western Slovakia for around 30 years. That was the last time the two nations were united; the Hungarians had conquered Slovakia by the 11th century, but the Czechs maintained their own principality (a kingdom from 1198) of Bohemia from around 900 to 1918.

Both Czechs and Slovaks struggled against powerful neighbouring peoples: Germans in the case of the Czechs and Hungarians in the case of the Slovaks (see History of the Czech Republic and History of Slovakia). Contacts between the Czechs and the Slovaks arose in the late 14th century, when Slovaks started to study at the University of Prague; in the 15th century, with the campaigns of the Czech Hussite armies to Slovakia; and in the 17th century, when Czech Protestants fled to Slovakia. Between the 15th and the 18th centuries, some educated Slovaks used written Czech as well as Slovak and Latin (see History of the Slovak language). The Czechs and Slovaks were also formally united in 1436–1439, 1453–1457, and 1490–1918, when Hungary (which included Slovakia), Bohemia and other Central European states were ruled by the same kings.

== Late 19th and early 20th centuries ==

At the end of the nineteenth century, the Czech and Slovak situations were very different because of their overlords&#x27; different stages of development within Austria-Hungary (the Austrians in Bohemia, the Hungarians in Slovakia). The only common feature was Bohemia&#x27;s status as the most industrialized part of Austria and Slovakia, albeit itself to different degrees:
*In Bohemia, a vigorous industrial revolution transformed a peasant nation into a differentiated society that included industrial workers, a middle class, and intellectuals. Under the influence of the Enlightenment and romanticism, the Czech national revival led to the establishment of the National Museum in 1818 and the National Theatre in 1881. Moreover, some Czechs were making political demands that included the reconstitution of an autonomous Bohemian Kingdom. The Czech cultural and political achievements were vigorously opposed by Bohemian Germans, who feared losing their privileged position. On the eve of World War I, the Czech leader Tomáš Masaryk began propagating the Czechoslovak idea, namely the reunion of Czechs and Slovaks into one political entity.
*The Slovaks, on the other hand, had no forum for political expression within Hungary, and their national revival was less marked. Slovakia was not industrialized until the end of the nineteenth century, meaning the Slovaks remained mostly rural people led by a small group of intellectuals. After the creation of the dual Austro-Hungarian monarchy in 1867, a strong national revival began in Hungary, severely repressing that of the Slovak people. By the eve of World War I, the Slovaks were struggling to preserve their newly found national identity.

Around the start of the 20th century, the idea of a &quot;Czecho-Slovak&quot; entity began to be advocated by some Czech and Slovak leaders. In the 1890s, contacts between Czech and Slovak intellectuals intensified. The Czech leader Masaryk was a keen advocate of Czech-Slovak cooperation. Some of his students formed the Czechoslovak Union and in 1898 published the journal &quot;Hlas&quot; (&quot;The Voice&quot;). In Slovakia, young Slovak intellectuals began to challenge the old Slovak National Party. But although the Czech and Slovak national movements began drawing closer together, their ultimate goals remained unclear. At least until World War I, the Czech and Slovak national movements struggled for autonomy within Austria and Hungary, respectively. Only during the war did the idea of an independent Czecho-Slovakia emerge.

== World War I (1914–1918)==

At the outbreak of World War I, the Czechs and Slovaks showed little enthusiasm for fighting for their perceived respective enemies, the Germans, the Austrians and the Hungarians, against fellow Slavs, the Russians and the Serbs. Large numbers of Czechs and Slovaks defected on the Russo - Polish front and formed the Czechoslovak Legion, organised by Milan Rastislav Štefánik (a Slovak astronomer and general of the French army). Masaryk went to western Europe and began propagating the idea that the Austro-Hungarian Empire should be dismembered and that Czechoslovakia should be an independent state. In 1916, together with Edvard Beneš and Milan Rastislav Štefánik, Masaryk created the Czechoslovak National Council. Masaryk in the United States, Štefánik in France, and Beneš in France and Britain then worked to gain Allied recognition. When secret talks between the Allies and Austrian emperor Charles I collapsed, the Allies recognized the Czechoslovak National Council in the summer of 1918 as the supreme organ of a future Czechoslovak government.

On October 22, 1915, Czech and Slovak representatives in the United States signed the Cleveland Agreement endorsing an independent Czech and Slovak federation with national autonomy for the Slovak people. This was followed by the Pittsburgh Agreement, signed on May 31, 1918 (Masaryk signed this on 30 May). The latter envisioned a plan for a unified Czecho-Slovak state in which Slovakia would have its own assembly. In early October 1918, Germany and Austria proposed peace negotiations. On October 18, while in the United States, Masaryk issued a declaration of Czechoslovak independence. Masaryk insisted that the new Czechoslovak state include the historic Bohemian Kingdom, containing the German-populated borderland. On October 21, however, German deputies from Bohemia joined other German and Austrian deputies in the Austrian parliament in declaring an independent German-Austrian state. Following the abdication of Charles I on November 11, Czech troops took control of borderlands.

Hungary withdrew from the Habsburg empire on November 1. The new liberal-democratic government of Hungary under Count Mihály Károlyi attempted to retain Slovakia. With Allied approval, the Czechs occupied Slovakia, and the Hungarians were forced to withdraw. The Czechs and Allies agreed on the Danube and Ipeľ rivers as the boundary between Hungary and Slovakia; a large Hungarian minority, occupying the fertile plain of the Danube, would be included in the new state.

<doc id="421656" wikidata="Q4810766" url="?curid=421656" title="Dublin City Council">
<text>Dublin City Council () is the local authority of the city of Dublin in Ireland. As a city council, it is governed by the Local Government Act 2001. Until 2001, the authority was known as Dublin Corporation. The council is responsible for public housing and community, roads and transportation, urban planning and development, amenity and culture and environment. The council has 63 elected members and is the largest local council in Ireland. Elections are held every five years and are by single transferable vote. The head of the council has the honorific title of Lord Mayor. The city administration is headed by a chief executive, Richard Shakespeare. The council meets at City Hall, Dublin.

==Legal status==
Local government in Dublin is regulated by the Local Government Act 2001. This provided for the renaming of the old Dublin Corporation to its present title of Dublin City Council. Dublin City Council sends seven representatives to the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly, one of three such Assemblies in the state.

Dublin City is bordered by the counties of Fingal, South Dublin and Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown. These four local government areas comprise the traditional County Dublin. In 2013, all of Dublin&#x27;s councils, except Fingal, supported the introduction of an executive mayor the Dublin Metropolitan Area, and a Citizen&#x27;s Assembly has been planned in order to establish what a combined Dublin Mayorship would look like.

===Statutory functions ===
The functions of the City Council include: public housing, city library services, refuse services, drainage, driver and vehicle licensing, planning and roads. The Dublin City Council&#x27;s Draft Budget for 2023 estimates a total revenue of €1.24 bn, which is an increase of €0.11bn from the previous year. The Housing and Building Division is the service with the largest spend, with an estimated operational expenditure of €550.5 m, almost €53 m more than in 2022. The estimated income for Housing and Building in 2023 is €457.5 m, up from €420.6m in 2022. The draft budget aims to maintain existing service levels at 2022 levels, with some modest increases in a small number of areas.

== Budget ==
=== 2023 (draft) ===
The estimated expenditure for 2023 is €1.24 bn, which is an increase of €0.11 bn over the 2022 Budget of €1.130 bn. The expenditure is divided into several service divisions, including Housing &amp; Building, Road Transport &amp; Safety, Water Services, Development Management, Environmental Services, Culture, Recreation &amp; Amenity, and Agriculture, Education, Health &amp; Welfare. The Housing and Building Division remains the service with the largest spend, with an estimated operational expenditure of €550.5m in 2023, almost €53m more than in 2022 (€497.4m). This increase relates to services that are largely government-funded, such as homeless services and RAS.

The estimated expenditure for each service division is:
* Housing and Building: €550,484,483 
* Water Services: €68,093,780
* Development Management: €63,715,641 
* Environmental Services: €247,419,867 
* Culture, Recreation and Amenity: €122,254,773 
* Agriculture, Education, Health and Welfare: €2,746,874

Compared to the 2022 budget, the estimated expenditure for 2023 increased by €0.11 bn. This increase is largely due to the increased spending on Housing and Building services, which are largely Government funded. The estimated net expenditure for each service division in the Dublin City Council&#x27;s Draft Budget for 2023 is listed above

The 2022 budget allocated €15.4 mn for energy-related expenses for Dublin City Council (DCC). DCC faces an additional €22.5 mn in costs over 2022 and 2023 due to energy and non-energy inflation. The government provides €5 mn for rising energy costs, and DCC bears the impact of broader inflation. Additionally, a public sector pay deal includes €9.9 mn and €25.9 mn in 2022 and 2023, respectively, to support the City Council as an employer.

==History==
Prior to 1841, the administrative and governmental system of Dublin, known as Dublin Corporation, was bicameral having an assembly of called the &quot;House of Aldermen&quot; and another called the &quot;House of Sheriffs and Commons&quot;. Under the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840, they were replaced by a unicameral assembly. The name &quot;Dublin City Council&quot; was adopted for the unicameral assembly. The Lord Mayor of Dublin presided over the assembly. This office had existed since 1665. The first City Council was elected in October 1841 when Daniel O&#x27;Connell became the first Lord Mayor. Since 1 January 2002, the functions of local government have been transferred to Dublin City Council. To coincide with its name change, the city council adopted a new logo and brand identity, based on a simplified version of the ancient &quot;three castles&quot; symbol.
==Structures==
Executive power is shared between the council and an appointed executive official known as the chief executive. The chief executive is responsible for a staff of 6,200. The offices of the chief executive and other administrative staff are based in the Civic Offices on Wood Quay. The Lord Mayor of Dublin acts as chair of the council is the ceremonial head of the city government.

Representative power is vested in the city assembly which has 63 members. The City Council meets in plenary session on the first Monday of every month in Dublin City Hall. One of the council&#x27;s most important roles is that of passing an annual budget. Should any Irish council fail to pass a budget within the allotted time, the Minister for the Environment is empowered to abolish it and grant its powers to a commissioner until the next scheduled council elections.
==Elections==
Members of Dublin City Council are elected for a five-year term of office on the electoral system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote from multi-member local electoral areas.

==Local electoral areas==
Dublin City is divided into LEAs, defined by electoral divisions. The electoral divisions were formerly known as wards and were defined in 1986, subject to revision in 1994 and in 1997.

==Council buildings==

The Lord Mayor&#x27;s official residence is the Mansion House, which first became the residence of the Lord Mayor in 1715.

Council meetings take place in the headquarters at Dublin City Hall. Formerly &quot;Royal Exchange&quot;, the City Hall is one of Dublin&#x27;s finest buildings and located on Dame Street. It was built in 1769–79 to the winning design of Thomas Cooley. In an architectural competition, James Gandon was the runner-up with a scheme that many people favoured. The building was taken over for city government use in the 1850s.

<text>The First Czechoslovak Republic emerged from the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in October 1918. The new state consisted mostly of territories inhabited by Czechs and Slovaks, but also included areas containing majority populations of other nationalities, particularly Germans (22.95 %), who accounted for more citizens than the state&#x27;s second state nation of the Slovaks, Hungarians (5.47 %) and Ruthenians (3.39 %). The new state comprised the total of Bohemia whose borders did not coincide with the language border between German and Czech. Despite initially developing effective representative institutions alongside a successful economy, the deteriorating international economic situation in the 1930s gave rise to growing ethnic tensions. The dispute between the Czech and German populations, fanned by the rise of Nazism in neighbouring Germany, resulted in the loss of territory under the terms of the Munich Agreement and subsequent events in the autumn of 1938, bringing about the end of the First Republic.

==Independence==

Following the Pittsburgh Agreement of May 1918, the Czechoslovak declaration of independence, created in Washington, was published by the Czechoslovak National Council, signed by Masaryk, Štefánik and Beneš on 18 October 1918 in Paris, and proclaimed on 28th October in Prague.

Initial authority within Czechoslovakia was assumed by the newly created National Assembly on 14 November 1918. Because territorial demarcations were uncertain and elections impossible, the provisional National Assembly was constituted on the basis of the 1911 elections to the Austrian parliament with the addition of 54 representatives from Slovakia. National minorities were not represented. Hungarians remained loyal to Hungary.

On 12 November 1918, a Republic of German Austria was declared, with the intent of unifying with Germany, relying on President Wilson&#x27;s principle of self-determination. The state claimed all the German-speaking areas of the former Cisleithania, including those in Czechoslovakia.

The National Assembly of Czechoslovakia elected Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk as its first president, chose a provisional government headed by Karel Kramář, and drafted a provisional constitution.

The Paris Peace Conference convened in January 1919. The Czech delegation was led by Kramář and Beneš, premier and foreign minister respectively, of the Czechoslovak provisional government. The conference approved the establishment of the Czechoslovak Republic, to encompass the historic Bohemian Kingdom, Moravia and Silesia, as well as Slovakia and Carpathian Ruthenia. The inclusion of Ruthenia provided a common frontier with Romania, an important ally against Hungary. To address concerns of the British delegation that the incorporation of exclusively German-settled areas violates the principle of self-determination, the Czech delegation had presented to the conference a memorandum containing misrepresentations of the German-settled area. In particular, the number of Czechs in the German-settled areas was overblown by a factor of ten and lands of German majority between Komotau and Teplitz was shown as Czech-majority, while the Germans of Moravia were neglected completely. No German or Austrian delegation was present the conference.

In a subcommittee for the German-Czech border, the American delegation proposed border correction such that Eger, Rumburg, Friedland, and Freiwaldau were to become part of Germany because of their half a million German-speaking inhabitants. Also the British David Lloyd George initially called for a rectification of the German-Bohemian border, but surrendered to Clemenceau&#x27;s intention to keep down the Germans. The border was hence set without holding referendums, even though Lloyd George himself had strongly called for referendums for determining the Polish-German border. 

In March 1919 there were reports that:
*Austria and Czechoslovakia had broken off diplomatic relations.
*Czechoslovakia&#x27;s government in Prague alleged a conspiracy between Austria and Saxony to invade Czechoslovakia.
The dispute was over possession of the German-speaking parts of Bohemia and Moravia (later known as the Sudetenland); their German-speaking inhabitants had declared themselves to be part of Austria, and if that was prevented, demanded to be annexed by Saxony and the German Republics. Czechoslovakia wanted to hold onto this area because of its many valuable mines. Czechoslovakia sent Czech troops into the German area to stop disorders, and the Vienna press printed reports of Czech troops firing on and killing Germans in that area, including 15–20 in Kaaden, three in Eger, and two in Karlsbad. During this, on about 1 March, Josef Mayer, Austria&#x27;s Minister of War (a native of Eger), went to go to Eger and was arrested at Gratzen after crossing the border, but was allowed to continue to Eger; two days later he went into Germany via Schärding, and by railway via Regensburg and Passau back to Vienna.

In January 1920 the Czechoslovak army, breaking prior agreements with Poland, crossed the demarcation line and by force of arms occupied the Trans-Olza region, where a 60% majority of the population was Polish, compared to 25% Czechs. After brief fights they made a truce on the power of which Czechoslovakia occupied areas to the west of Olza River. The Czech claim to Lusatia, which had been part of the Bohemian Kingdom until the Thirty Years&#x27; War, was rejected. 

On 10 September 1919, Czechoslovakia signed the Minorities Treaty, placing its ethnic minorities under the protection of the League of Nations.

==Statehood==
The establishment of the Constitution of 1920 installed a parliamentary system and representative democracy with relatively few constituents for each representative. This allowed a great variety of political parties to emerge, with no clear front runner or leading political entity.

Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk was elected the country&#x27;s first president in the 1920 election and his guidance helped to hold the country together. A coalition of five Czechoslovak parties, which became known as the &quot;Pětka&quot; (The Five), constituted the backbone of the government and maintained stability. Prime Minister Antonín Švehla led the Pětka for most of the 1920s and designed a pattern of coalition politics that survived until 1938. Masaryk was re-elected in 1925 and 1929, serving as President until 14 December 1935 when he resigned due to poor health. He was succeeded by Edvard Beneš.

Beneš had served as Czechoslovak foreign minister from 1918 to 1935, and created the system of alliances that determined the republic&#x27;s international stance until 1938. A democratic statesman of Western orientation, Beneš relied heavily on the League of Nations as guarantor of the post war status quo and the security of newly formed states. He negotiated the Little Entente (an alliance with Yugoslavia and Romania) in 1921 to counter Hungarian revanchism and Habsburg restoration.

The leaders of Czechoslovakia needed to find solutions for the multiplicity of cultures living within one country. From 1928 and 1940, Czechoslovakia was divided into the four &quot;lands&quot; (, ); Bohemia, Moravia-Silesia, Slovakia and Carpathian Ruthenia. Although in 1927 assemblies were provided for Bohemia, Slovakia, and Ruthenia, their jurisdiction was limited to adjusting laws and regulations of the central government to local needs. National minorities were assured special protection; in districts where they constituted 20% of the population, members of minority groups were granted full freedom to use their language in everyday life, in schools, and in matters dealing with authorities. German parties also participated in the government starting in 1926, while Hungarian parties, supporting Hungarian irredentist claims, never joined the Czechoslovak government but were not openly hostile to it.

==Growing conflict==
Due to Czechoslovakia&#x27;s centralized political structure, nationalism arose in the non-Czech nationalities, and several parties and movements were formed with the aim of broader political autonomy. The Slovak People&#x27;s Party led by Andrej Hlinka is an example.

When German dictator Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, fear of German aggression became widespread in eastern Central Europe. Beneš ignored the possibility of a stronger Central European alliance system, remaining faithful to his Western policy. He did, however, seek the participation of the Soviet Union in an alliance to include France. (Beneš&#x27;s earlier attitude towards the Soviet regime had been one of caution.) In 1935 the Soviet Union signed treaties with France and Czechoslovakia. In essence, the treaties provided that the Soviet Union would come to Czechoslovakia&#x27;s aid, but only if French assistance came first. Hitler himself remarked to his foreign minister von Neurath and top military officials in 1937 that he intended to absorb Bohemia and Austria, with a vague sentence about the need to expel two million Czechs and the eventual elimination of the Czech nation.

There was a large German minority in Czechoslovakia, mostly living in Sudetenland. 

They demanded autonomy within Czechoslovakia, claiming they were oppressed by the national government. The political vehicle for this agitation was the newly founded Sudeten German Party (&quot;Sudetendeutsche Partei&quot; - SdP) led by Konrad Henlein, and financed with Nazi money. In the 1935 Parliamentary elections, the SdP had a surprise success, securing over 2/3 of the Sudeten German vote. This worsened diplomatic relations between Germany and Czechoslovakia. Hitler met with Henlein in Berlin on 28 March 1938, and ordered him to raise demands unacceptable to the Czechoslovak government. On 24 April, the SdP issued the Carlsbad Programme, demanding autonomy for the Sudetenland and the freedom to profess Nazi ideology. If these demands were granted, the Sudetenland could then align with Nazi Germany.

On 17 September 1938 Adolf Hitler ordered the establishment of Sudetendeutsches Freikorps, a paramilitary organization that took over the structure of Ordnersgruppe, an organization of ethnic-Germans in Czechoslovakia that had been dissolved by the Czechoslovak authorities the previous day due to its implication in large number of terrorist activities. The organization was sheltered, trained and equipped by German authorities and conducting cross border terrorist operations into Czechoslovak territory. Relying on the Convention for the Definition of Aggression, Czechoslovak president Edvard Beneš and the government-in-exile later regarded 17 September 1938 as the beginning of the undeclared German-Czechoslovak war. This understanding has been assumed also by the contemporary Czech Constitutional court.

<doc id="421670" wikidata="Q74231" url="?curid=421670" title="Chicane">
<text>A chicane () is a serpentine curve in a road, added by design rather than dictated by geography. Chicanes add extra turns and are used both in motor racing and on roads and streets to slow traffic for safety. For example, one form of chicane is a short, shallow S-shaped turn that requires the driver to turn slightly left and then slightly right to continue on the road, requiring the driver to reduce speed. The word &quot;chicane&quot; is derived from the French verb &quot;chicaner&quot;, which means &quot;to create difficulties&quot; or &quot;to dispute pointlessly&quot;, &quot;quibble&quot;, which is also the root of the English noun &quot;chicanery&quot;. The Spanish verb &quot;chicanear&quot; also means &quot;to use trickery&quot;.

== Motor racing ==

On modern racing circuits, chicanes are usually located after long straights, making them a prime location for overtaking. They can be placed tactically by circuit designers to prevent vehicles from reaching speeds deemed to be unsafe. A prime example of this is the three chicanes at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza, introduced in the early 1970s; the Chase at Mount Panorama, added in 1987; and the Tamburello chicane at Imola, which was placed in 1995 after Ayrton Senna&#x27;s death at the original corner. At Le Mans in 1990, two chicanes were placed on the Mulsanne Straight where Group C prototypes had previously achieved speeds of in order to conform to new international regulations limiting the maximum length of a straight on a motor racing circuit to .

Some tracks, such as the Yas Marina Circuit in Abu Dhabi, feature optional chicanes. Faster cars will take the chicane, but slower cars (such as amateur club racers) may avoid the chicane because they are not capable of reaching equally high speeds on the straights. Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya has one at Europcar, which became the source of controversy when it was instituted for MotoGP after a fatal crash.

Chicanes can make slipstreaming less potent and break up pelotons during motor races.

The term is used in other types of racing, such as bobsleigh, to indicate a similar shift in the course or track.

A slower driver or vehicle that delays competitors is sometimes disparaged as a &quot;mobile chicane&quot; or &quot;moving chicane&quot;. In some cases they may not move out of the way quickly enough to allow competitors in higher positions (having completed more laps) past, despite repeated showings of blue flags. This can cost competitors valuable time and championship points. This same term, applied to traffic calming, can refer to the usage of portable devices to create a chicane configuration.

== Traffic calming ==
Chicanes are a type of &quot;horizontal deflection&quot; used in traffic calming schemes to reduce the speed of traffic. Drivers are expected to reduce speed to negotiate the lateral displacement in the vehicle path. There are several variations of traffic-calming chicanes, but they generally fall into one of two broad categories:

* Single-lane working chicanes, which consist of staggered build-outs, narrowing the road so that traffic in one direction has to give way to opposing traffic
* Two-way working chicanes, which use build-outs to provide deflection, but with lanes separated by road markings or a central island.

Limited crash data for chicane schemes indicate changes in injury crashes (range from −54% to +32%) and crash severity.

Chicanes can also be used to prevent access to certain vehicles. The Vermont Agency of Transportation has considered adding chicanes to Route 108 in Stowe and Cambridge to prevent the passage of tractor-trailers, which often get stuck further up the road.

== Pedestrian ==
A &quot;pedestrian chicane&quot; is a kind of permanent fence used at a railway crossing to slow pedestrians down and to force them to observe both directions before crossing the railway tracks. While passing the chicane, one has to turn to the left and to the right, increasing the probability of seeing an approaching train. A similar arrangement is sometimes used at the entrances of parks to impede bicycle, car, mobility scooter, and wheelchair access.

<text>Stephen Pelham Pound (born 3 July 1948) is a British former Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Ealing North from 1997 to 2019.

==Background==
His father, Pelham Pendennis Pound (1922–1999) was a BBC sub-editor and former journalist (including for the &quot;News of the World&quot; and &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;) and literary agent whose clients included the osteopath Stephen Ward. When Ward was arrested for his role in the Profumo affair it was at Pound&#x27;s home and Pound claims he had a minor role in the events leading to Ward&#x27;s suicide. Pound&#x27;s grandfather, Reginald Pound (1894–1991) F.R.S.L. was a journalist and biographer (including of Lord Northcliffe and A. P. Herbert), employed by, amongst others, the &quot;Daily Express&quot; and &quot;Strand Magazine&quot; (editor 1942–46).

Pound went to Hertford Grammar School (now called Richard Hale School) on Hale Road in Hertford. He was educated, as a mature student from 1979–84, at the London School of Economics where he gained a Diploma in Industrial Relations and a BSc in Economics. He was General Secretary of the student union from 1981–82.

He was a boxer in the Royal Navy when at sea from 1964–66, leading &quot;Private Eye&quot; magazine to refer to him as &quot;Ealing North&#x27;s tattooed bruiser&quot;. He also played football for Hanwell Town, worked as a bus conductor for London Transport, from 1966–68, and was a hospital porter from 1969–79. Prior to becoming an MP he worked for Paddington Churches Housing Association as a housing manager from 1984 until he became an MP. He was based at their office in Willesden.

==Political career==
Pound served as a councillor in Ealing from 1982 to 1998. In 1982, he won Elthorne ward and in 1986 he was re-elected in his home ward of Hobbayne. He was the MP for Ealing North from 1997 to 2019.

He served as the Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to Hazel Blears until he resigned in protest at the decision to replace Trident on 14 March 2007. He supported Blears in the 2007 Labour Party deputy leadership election.

Pound held the position of PPS to Minister Stephen Timms at the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform from October 2008 until May 2010. In April 2009 he was reported to have announced his resignation from this position, in order to vote against the government&#x27;s policy of restricting the right of former Gurkhas to settle in the UK.

After the election of Ed Miliband as Labour leader in October 2010, he became an assistant whip. In November of that year he became shadow minister for Northern Ireland. He had served on the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee between 1997 and 2010.

In 2012, despite his republican views, Pound criticised protests arranged during Elizabeth II&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee stating &quot;You can hold republican views but you respect the current monarch – particularly in this year of all years. There is no need to lose your manners, and this is deliberately provocative.&quot;

In February 2013, Pound voted against the second reading of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013. Subsequently, in May 2013 the MP voted against the bill’s third and final reading, opposing the legalisation of same-sex marriage within England and Wales.

He supported Owen Smith in the failed attempt to replace Jeremy Corbyn in the 2016 Labour leadership election.

In 2019, Pound announced that he would not seek re-election at the next general election.

==Voting record==
How Stephen Pound voted on key issues since 2001:

* Voted against introducing a smoking ban.
* Voted for introducing ID cards.
* Voted for introducing foundation hospitals.
* Voted for introducing student top-up fees.
* Voted for Labour&#x27;s anti-terrorism laws.
* Voted for the Iraq War.
* Voted against investigating the Iraq War.
* Voted against replacing Trident missile system.
* Voted for the hunting ban.
* Voted against same-sex marriage.
* Voted for laws to stop climate change.

==MPs&#x27; expenses scandal==

In May 2009 it was discovered Pound had claimed a mileage allowance of £4,251, equating to 11,004 miles of travel between his constituency and Parliament 11 miles away. He explained this by saying he made the trip &quot;two or three times a day&quot;. He later said he had abandoned his ageing car altogether in favour of public transport.

==Media involvement==
In 2003 BBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; asked its listeners to suggest a law that they would like to see put onto the statute books. The BBC received 10,000 nominations and five were short-listed, from which listeners then voted to select their preferred choice. Pound agreed to sponsor in Parliament whichever idea eventually won the final vote.

On 1 January 2004 it was announced on air that first place with 37 per cent of the vote had gone to the proposal to authorise homeowners to use any means to defend their home from intruders. (The controversial farmer Tony Martin was still very much in the news.) Pound&#x27;s on-air reaction to the result was that, &quot;The people have spoken—the bastards&quot;.

In May 2005, Pound appeared on British TV quiz show &quot;Have I Got News For You&quot; and in December of that year in a special edition of &quot;University Challenge&quot;.

In April 2015, a video circulated on social media where Pound asked Cameron whether he was willing to disassociate himself from the &quot;snobbish and disdainful&quot; bingo and beer advertisement tweeted by the Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps. The Prime Minister thanked him for advertising the Conservative&#x27;s strong economic policy, and ended his reply concerning Pound by saying: &quot;I am sure that the honourable gentleman enjoys a game of bingo – it&#x27;s the only time he&#x27;ll ever get close to Number 10&quot;. After going viral it picked up more than 3.6 million views in less than 24 hours. 

==Personal life==
He married Maggie in 1976. They have a son and daughter. He is a Roman Catholic. In 2004, he discovered that he fathered a daughter when he was eighteen years old; this information was revealed to the public in January 2005. Pound is a Fulham FC fan, and also the Patron of Hanwell Town FC.

Pound was made Vice-President of the Catholic Union of Great Britain in February 2024.

<doc id="421683" wikidata="Q7747750" url="?curid=421683" title="A Little White Wedding Chapel">
<text>A Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas, Nevada has been the site of many quick celebrity weddings. It is noted for its &quot;Drive-Thru Tunnel of Vows&quot;. The chapel was built and opened in 1954 by Arvid and Neva Barnhart. 

Charolette Richards bought the chapel in 1981. She came into the wedding business through marriage with Merle Richards, owner of Little Church of the West. Merle and Charolette Richards together opened Algiers&#x27; Little Church of the West in 1968. The couple later divorced, and Charolette went into business on her own with Little White Chapel. She has presided over the marriages of Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland, Mickey Rooney, Michael Jordan, Dame Joan Collins, Britney Spears, Bruce Willis and Demi Moore. Mrs. Richards sold the chapel in 2022 to Cliff Evarts and Melody Willis-Williams.

The chapel has been featured on such TV shows as WWE &quot;Raw&quot;, &quot;Supernatural&quot;, &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. Michael Ross and Naomi Defensor, two cast members on the 2011 season of &quot;The Real World: Las Vegas&quot;, participated in a mock wedding at the Chapel during the June 1, 2011 season finale of that series.

Similarly named Las Vegas wedding chapels, such as The Little Church of the West, The Little Chapel by the Courthouse, and the Chapel of the Flowers are often confused with A Little White Wedding Chapel. The Little Chapel by the Courthouse was also owned by We&#x27;ve Only Just Begun Inc. (Charolette Richards).

<text>Vanessa Denae Olivarez (born April 7, 1981) is an American singer, songwriter, and actress. She is the vocalist, songwriter, and autoharpist for the country bands Granville Automatic and Mama&#x27;s Blue Dress, has written songs for the country duo Sugarland, and was in the Top 12 of the second season of the television series &quot;American Idol&quot; in 2003.

Later that year, she released a single, &quot;The One&quot;, which peaked at number nine on the Canadian charts. In 2004, she played Tracy Turnblad, the lead role in the Canadian version of &quot;Hairspray&quot;, for which she was nominated for a Dora Award.

==&quot;American Idol&quot;==
Olivarez&#x27;s friends talked her into auditioning in 2002 for the second season of &quot;American Idol&quot;. She performed Irene Cara&#x27;s &quot;Out Here On My Own&quot; in the semi-finals. During a following round where contestants write their own numbers, Olivarez impressed the judges with her song &quot;The Only Thing Special About You Is Me&quot;. She moved into the top 32 contestants of the season. When she reached the top judges she switched to Queen&#x27;s &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;. They compared her to singer and actress Bette Midler. She was in the final twelve and she performed The Supremes&#x27; &quot;You Keep Me Hangin&#x27; On&quot;. Soon after she was eliminated from American Idol, she lent her celebrity status to support animals&#x27; rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. She posed naked for their &quot;I would rather go naked than wear fur&quot; campaign. The ad was first unveiled in Herald Square in middle of Manhattan and also ran in Atlanta. She also did a benefit for Atlanta Humane Society and The Station nightclub fire.

==Canada and first singles==
In 2003, Olivarez was contacted by Canadian songwriter and actor James Collins who brought her to Toronto, Canada, to write and record some new music. Her first single, &quot;The One&quot;, co-written by Olivarez, James Collins and Dave Pickell, had &quot;I&#x27;m In Love with My Best Friend&#x27;s Ex&quot; as a B-side, and reached number nine on Canada&#x27;s single charts &amp; Top Thirty on the Canadian BDS airplay chart. Another of her songs, &quot;As Vain As You&quot; (also co-written with Collins &amp; Pickell), was on the compilation album &quot;Girls Night Out 3&quot;.

She played Tracy Turnblad in the Canadian version of the musical &quot;Hairspray&quot;. After &quot;Hairspray&quot; she returned to the United States and joined an Atlanta musical group Butterfly Stitch which released an EP and live album.

In May 2005 she appeared in an American Idol theme week on &quot;Family Feud&quot;.

==Granville Automatic==
In 2009 she co-founded Granville Automatic, a country duo, with guitarist and songwriter Elizabeth Elkins who is a grand prize winner of the John Lennon Songwriting Contest. They are named after a 19th-Century typewriter, and collaborate to write and perform songs about history. They recorded an eight-song set for an episode of PBS&#x27; &quot;Sun Studio Sessions&quot; (taped at Memphis&#x27; Sun Studio) and the digital-only EP Live from Sun Studio is available online. Their self-titled album, &quot;Granville Automatic&quot;, came out in 2012. Their second album, &quot;An Army Without Music,&quot; was released in 2015 and is a collection of songs inspired by Civil War battles.

==Boys Club for Girls==
In 2019 she joined with Amie Miriello to form the Americana duo, Boys Club for Girls. On January 27, 2020, they released a video for the song &quot;The Weatherman&quot; off their album expected to release later in the year.

<doc id="421685" wikidata="Q7383301" url="?curid=421685" title="Rusyns and Ukrainians in Czechoslovakia (1918–1938)">
<text>Rusyns and Ukrainians in Czechoslovakia during the period from 1918 to 1938, were ethnic Rusyns and Ukrainians of the First Czechoslovak Republic, representing the two main ethnic communities in the most eastern region of Czechoslovakia, known during that period as the Subcarpathian Rus.

==History==
The region of Subcarpathian Rus was the economically poorest region of Czechoslovakia. In 1914, the region was referred to by one historian as &quot;little more than a Magyar deer park&quot;. Its people were wretchedly poor, having for centuries supplemented the meagre living the mountainous area afforded with seasonal agricultural labor and service in the Hungarian infantry.

Subcarpathian Rus was a hotbed of secessionist sentiment throughout the inter-war period. These were manifested by strong cultural and linguistic links with the Ukrainians, in the Soviet Union and interwar Poland. There were also calls for Ukrainian autonomy within the Czechoslovak Republic, and calls for the formation of a Lemko-Rusyn Republic on the northern side of the Carpathians, attempted to unite with this faction.

During World War I, Rusyn leaders had reached an agreement with Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk to secure autonomy to Subcarpathian region within a future Czechoslovak state. The agreement received international sanction in the 1919 Treaty of Saint-Germain. The Paris Peace Conference had also stipulated earlier that year that Subcarpathian Rus be granted full autonomy and promised the territory a diet having legislative power in all matters of local administration. However, the constitution of 1920 limited the provision on autonomy, making reference to the requirements of the unity of the state. All legislation of Subcarpathian Rus was made subject to approval by the president of the republic, and the governor of Subcarpathian Rus was to be nominated by the president. As a result, even the constitutional provision for regional autonomy was never implemented; the regional diet of Subcarpathian Rus was never convened. The issue of autonomy became a major source of discontent. Other grievances included the placement of the western boundary—which left 150,000 Rusyns in Slovakia—and the large numbers of Czechs brought to Subcarpathian Rus as administrators and educators. Political life in Subcarpathian Rus was characterized by a proliferation of political parties and a diversity of cultural tendencies. All Czechoslovak political parties were represented, and a number of indigenous parties emerged as well. Of particular significance were the Ukrainophiles, Russophiles, Hungarians, and communists.

==Political movements==
Ukrainophile and Russophile tendencies were strengthened by the large influx of émigrés following the war.

The Ukrainophiles were largely members of the Eastern Catholic Churches and espoused autonomy within Czechoslovakia. Some favored union with Soviet Ukraine. The Ukrainophiles were represented by the local Social democratcs and the National Christian Party led by Avgustyn Voloshyn. They were seen as more friendly towards the government.

The Russophile part of the population was largely Eastern Orthodox and also espoused regional autonomy. They were organized politically in the Carpatho-Russian Labour Party of Small Peasants and Landless (KTP), led by Andrey Gagatko; the Agricultural Federation (AZS), led by Andrej Brody; and the fascist-style Fencik Party. The Czechoslovak National Democracy was generally supportive of the Russophile movement, specifically the Russian National Party (RNP) and later the Russian National Bloc. In the 1929 election, the Russian National Bloc consisted of the RNP, AZS, KTP and the Russian National Union of Vasil Fedak. In the 1935 election, the &quot;Russian Bloc&quot; consisted of RNP and the Fencik Party.

Hungarians populated a compact area in southern parts of Subcarpathian Rus. They were represented by the Unified Magyar Party, which consistently received ten percent of the vote in the region and was in permanent opposition to the government.

The communists, strong in the poor province, attempted to appeal to the Ukrainian element by espousing union with Soviet Ukraine. In 1935 the communists polled 25 percent of the vote in Subcarpathian Rus. The elections of 1935 gave only 37 percent of the Rusyn vote to political parties supporting the Czechoslovak government. The communists, Unified Magyars, and autonomist groups polled 63 percent.

<doc id="421690" wikidata="Q5365535" url="?curid=421690" title="Elliot Morley">
<text>Elliot Anthony Morley (born 6 July 1952) is a British former Labour Party politician, who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Glanford and Scunthorpe from 1987 to 1997 and then Scunthorpe from 1997 to 2010. In 2009, he was accused by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; of continuing to claim parliamentary expenses for a mortgage that had already been repaid. Morley was prosecuted and on 7 April 2011 pleaded guilty in Southwark Crown Court to two counts of false accounting, involving over £30,000. On 20 May 2011, he was sentenced to 16 months&#x27; imprisonment. He was released from prison on 20 September 2011 having served a quarter of his sentence.

==Early life==
He attended St Margaret&#x27;s C of E High School on Aigburth Road in Aigburth in south Liverpool and received a BEd from Hull College of Education. He was head of Special Needs at Greatfield High School in Hull.

==Political career==
Before entering Parliament, Morley was a Labour member of Hull City Council representing Drypool Ward from 1979 to 1986. He stood unsuccessfully for Beverley in 1983.

He served as Fisheries Minister from 1997 to 2003, and then as Environment Minister in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, but left government in the May 2006 reshuffle. During his time in government, Morley pushed for a series of environmental causes. In 2004, he sought to strengthen the United Kingdom&#x27;s efforts to purchase legally harvested lumber and aided the launch of a programme to manage flooding and coastal erosion called &#x27;WaveNet&#x27;. In 2005 Morley assisted in the establishment of a Governmental Decontamination Service, to provide decontamination and cleansing assistance after chemical, radiological, biological, or nuclear incidents and major accidental releases of harmful materials.

On 19 December 2006 he was appointed to the Privy Council. This was revoked on 14 June 2011. He was Chairman of the Energy and Climate Change Select Committee, leaving this post when his expenses claims came under investigation. In 2007 Morley voted to support the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill, which would have given Parliament a blanket exemption from the Freedom of Information Act and thereby prevent the release of any information on expenses claims by Members of Parliament. However the Bill was defeated.

===Expenses claims===

As part of its disclosure of expenses of British Members of Parliament, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; alleged on 14 May 2009 that Morley claimed £800 a month in respect of a property in Winterton, near Scunthorpe, for 18 months after the mortgage ended, and received an overpayment of £16,800 in total.

&quot;The Telegraph&quot; also alleged Morley let a London flat designated as his main residence to another Labour MP, Ian Cawsey, a close friend and former special adviser. Cawsey named the property as his second home, allowing him to claim £1,000 a month to cover the rent which he was charged by Morley. In November 2007, the newspaper claims Morley &#x27;flipped&#x27; his designated second home from his Scunthorpe property to his London flat, and for four months the two men claimed expenses on the same property.

Morley told BBC News that he had repaid the money two weeks before &quot;The Telegraph&quot; story breaking upon realising he had mistakenly continued claiming for his mortgage payments after the mortgage had been paid off in 2006. On 14 May 2009 he was suspended from holding office in the Parliamentary Labour Party because of this scandal. Morley referred himself to John Lyon, Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, in an effort to clear his name. It was reported that this inquiry was put on hold pending a police investigation. On 29 May 2009 he announced that he would not stand for re-election, but refused to resign immediately.

===Prosecution===
On 5 February 2010, it was reported that Morley would face criminal charges over his expenses, and the Labour whip was subsequently suspended. On 27 May 2010, Morley, David Chaytor, Jim Devine, and Lord Hanningfield (Paul White) appeared at Southwark Crown Court for a preliminary hearing. They faced charges of false accounting under the Theft Act.

Morley eventually pleaded guilty in the Crown Court at Southwark on 7 April 2011 before Mr Justice Saunders, who had presided over the other prosecutions in the Parliamentary expenses scandal. On 20 May 2011, Morley was sentenced to 16 months imprisonment on two counts of false accounting. He served four months in prison – a quarter of the sentence – and was released under the home detention curfew scheme. On 8 June 2011, he was expelled from the Privy Council, the first expulsion since Edgar Speyer in 1921.

Morley was previously a Honorary Fellow of the Institution of Civil Engineers for services to flood and coastal defence. He was expelled from the Institution of Civil Engineers on 4 July 2011, when the Institution&#x27;s Professional Conduct Panel ruled that due to his breaching of &quot;Rule 1 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, which require all members to uphold the dignity, standing and reputation of the Institution&quot; by &quot;committing offences of False Accounting in connection with his responsibilities as a Member of Parliament&quot; he should be expelled from the Institution.

==Personal life==
Morley married Patricia Hunt in 1975 in Hull. They have two children: a daughter (born 1980) and a son (born August 1984). He is Honorary Vice President of the Association of Drainage Authorities and Wildlife and Countryside Link. He has an Honorary Fellowship from the University of Lincoln for services to nature conservation.

He is a former President of Hull Teachers Association.

<text>The German-speaking population in the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|interwar Czechoslovak Republic]], 23.6% of the population at the 1921 census, usually refers to the Sudeten Germans, although there were other German ethno-linguistic enclaves elsewhere in Czechoslovakia (e.g. Hauerland or Zips) inhabited by Carpathian Germans (including Zipser Germans or Zipser Saxons), and among the German-speaking urban dwellers there were ethnic Germans and/or Austrians as well as German-speaking Jews. 14% of the Czechoslovak Jews considered themselves Germans in the 1921 census, but a much higher percentage declared German as their colloquial tongue during the last censuses under the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

==Carpathian Germans and Sudeten Germans==
The terms Carpathian Germans and Sudeten Germans are relatively recent and were not traditionally used in the past. The former was coined by historian and ethnologue in the early 20th century. The latter was coined in 1904 by journalist and politician and was used mostly after 1919.

==Historical settlements==
There were several subregions and towns with German-speaking absolute or relative majorities in the interwar Czechoslovakian Republic.


In Bohemia and Moravia (present-day Czech Republic), there were German Bohemians (&quot;Deutschböhmen, Čeští Němci&quot;) and German Moravians (&quot;Deutschmährer, Moravští Němci&quot;), as well as German Silesians, in e.g. the Hlučín Region (part of Czech Silesia but formerly part of the Austrian Silesia Province before Seven Years&#x27; War in 1756).

In Slovakia there were two German-speaking enclaves in Hauerland and Spiš. In the Austro-Hungarian Szepes County (Spiš), there were according to censuses 35% Germans in 1869, 25% in 1900 and 1910. There was also a relative German-language majority in the border city of Pressburg/Bratislava: 59.9% at the 1890 census, 41.9% in 1910, 36% in 1919, 28.1 in 1930, 20% in 1940.

There were also two linguistic enclaves in Subcarpathian Ruthenia (present-day Ukraine).

==German-speaking urban Jews==

In addition, there was a sizeable German-speaking urban Jewish minority, for instance the writers Franz Kafka, Max Brod and Felix Weltsch, and Jewish politicians were elected as deputies, and even as leaders of German minority parties such as Ludwig Czech and Siegfried Taub in the German Social Democratic Workers Party in the Czechoslovak Republic or Bruno Kafka (second cousin of Franz Kafka) in the .

==German-language education in Czechoslovakia==

<text>John Willard Toland (June 29, 1912 – January 4, 2004) was an American writer and historian. He is best known for a biography of Adolf Hitler and a Pulitzer Prize-winning history of World War II-era Japan, &quot;The Rising Sun&quot;.

==Biography==

Toland was born in 1912 in La Crosse, Wisconsin. He graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire in 1932 and from Williams College in 1936 and attended the Yale School of Drama for a time. His original goal was to become a playwright. In the summers between college years, he traveled with hobos and wrote several plays with hobos as central characters, none of which were performed. He recalled in 1961 that in his early years as a writer he had been &quot;about as big a failure as a man can be&quot;. He claimed to have written six complete novels, 26 plays, and a hundred short stories before completing his first sale, a short story for which &quot;The American Magazine&quot; paid $165 in 1954. At one point he managed to get an article on dirigibles into &quot;LOOK&quot; magazine; it proved extremely popular and led to his career as a historian. Dirigibles were the subject of his first full-length published book, &quot;Ships in the Sky&quot; (1957).

His most important work may be &quot;The Rising Sun&quot; (Random House, 1970), for which he won the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction in 1971. Based on original and extensive interviews with high-ranking Japanese officials who survived the war, the book chronicles the Empire of Japan from the military rebellion of February 1936 to the end of World War II. It won the Pulitzer because it was the first book in English to tell the history of the Pacific War from the Japanese point of view, rather than the prevailing American one.

==Novels==
While predominantly a writer of nonfiction, Toland also published two historical novels, &quot;Gods of War&quot; and &quot;Occupation&quot;. He says in his 1997 autobiography that he earned little money from his prize-winner &quot;The Rising Sun&quot; but was set for life from the earnings of &quot;Adolf Hitler&quot;, for which he also did original research.

== Death ==
Toland died of pneumonia on January 4, 2004, at Danbury Hospital in Danbury, Connecticut.

<doc id="421699" wikidata="Q335004" url="?curid=421699" title="Hastings Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay">
<text>General Hastings Lionel &quot;Pug&quot; Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay (21 June 1887 – 17 December 1965) was a British politician, diplomat and general in the British Indian Army who was the first secretary general of NATO. He also was Winston Churchill&#x27;s chief military assistant during the Second World War.

Ismay was born in Nainital, India, in 1887, and educated in the United Kingdom at Charterhouse School and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. After Sandhurst, he joined the Indian Army as an officer of the 21st Prince Albert Victor&#x27;s Own Cavalry. During the First World War, he served with the Camel Corps in British Somaliland, where he joined in the British fight against the &quot;Mad Mullah&quot;, Mohammed Abdullah Hassan. In 1925, Ismay became an Assistant Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence (CID). After being promoted to the rank of colonel, he served as the military secretary for Lord Willingdon, the Viceroy of India, then returned to the CID as Deputy Secretary in 1936.

On 1 August 1938, shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War, Ismay became the committee&#x27;s secretary and began planning for the impending war. In May 1940, when Winston Churchill became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, he selected Ismay as his chief military assistant and staff officer. In that capacity, Ismay served as the principal link between Churchill and the Chiefs of Staff Committee. Ismay also accompanied Churchill to many of the Allied war conferences. For Ismay&#x27;s advice and aid, &quot;Churchill owed more, and admitted that he owed more&quot; to him &quot;than to anybody else, military or civilian, in the whole of the war.&quot;

After the end of the war, Ismay remained in the army for another year, and helped to reorganise the Ministry of Defence. He then retired from the military and served as Lord Mountbatten of Burma&#x27;s chief of staff in India, helping to oversee its partition. From 1948 to 1951, he served as chairman of the council of the Festival of Britain, helping to organise and promote the event. Then, in 1951, when Churchill again became prime minister, he appointed Ismay Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations.

Ismay accepted the position, but resigned after only six months to become the first secretary general of NATO in 1952. While Secretary General, Ismay is also credited as having been the first person to say that the purpose of NATO was &quot;to keep the Soviet Union out, the Americans in, and the Germans down,&quot; a saying that has since become a common way to describe the dynamics of NATO. He served in this role until 1957, and helped establish and define the position. After retiring from NATO, Ismay wrote his memoirs, &quot;The Memoirs of General Lord Ismay&quot;, served on a variety of corporate boards, and co-chaired the Ismay–Jacob Committee, which reorganised the Ministry of Defence once again. He died on 17 December 1965, at his home, Wormington Grange, Gloucestershire.

==Early life==
Ismay was born in Nainital, Kumaon, India, on 21 June 1887. His father, Sir Stanley Ismay, was a member of the Viceroy&#x27;s Legislative Council, and his mother, Beatrice Ellen, was the daughter of an Army colonel. Ismay began his education in Britain at the Charterhouse School, and his parents hoped that after completing his education there he would attend Cambridge and enter the civil service.

Ismay, however, &quot;had a sneaking desire to be a cavalry soldier&quot;, and after doing poorly on his final examinations at Charterhouse, he was ineligible to attend Cambridge. As a result, he entered the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in 1904. Ismay would later write: &quot;Sandhurst never meant nearly so much to me as Charterhouse had&quot;, but he enjoyed his time at the college and studied alongside many men who went on to become important military officers, including Lord Gort, Edgar Ludlow-Hewitt and Cyril Newall.

===Indian Army===
After completing the course at Sandhurst, Ismay was placed fourth overall in its examinations and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Indian Army. Ismay was then attached to the Gloucestershire Regiment of the British Army in Ambala, where he served a one-year mandatory apprenticeship. After leaving the regiment, Ismay did not immediately find a place in the Indian cavalry, so he spent nine months floating among positions with various British and Indian units.

In 1907, Ismay found a permanent position in the Indian cavalry, joining the 21st Prince Albert Victor&#x27;s Own Cavalry, based at Risalpur. Ismay thoroughly enjoyed his time with the regiment, describing it as &quot;blissful.&quot; In 1908, he saw his first action with the regiment, when it was sent into Afghanistan, pursuing Mohmand raiders who had taken several Hindu women as hostages. Immediately after Ismay&#x27;s regiment returned from action, he was hospitalised in Peshawar due to heat stroke, but he recovered quickly and, along with the rest of his regiment, received the India General Service Medal.

In 1910, after a reorganisation of the Indian Army, Ismay&#x27;s regiment moved from Risalpur to Jhelum, further from the frontier. Shortly thereafter, Ismay was appointed the adjutant of his regiment, a position which he held for four years, during which time he also read voraciously and developed a great admiration for Winston Churchill, whom he sought to emulate.

==Somaliland==
In early 1914, just before Ismay&#x27;s appointment as adjutant was set to expire, he met C. A. L Howard, another British officer serving in India, who told him about an opportunity to serve with the King&#x27;s African Rifles in British Somaliland. Ismay decided that this was &quot;just the sort of job that [he] wanted,&quot; and applied immediately. Due to his reputation &quot;as a thorough and dependable officer of sound judgement,&quot; Ismay was appointed second in command of the Somaliland Camel Corps, a cavalry unit led by Thomas Cubitt.
Ismay left India for Somaliland in late July 1914, and arrived on 9 August, shortly after the outbreak of the First World War in Europe. Like other officers in Somaliland, Ismay was &quot;unhappy at being left out of the great war&quot; and repeatedly asked for a transfer to the European front. In the end, however, Ismay&#x27;s superiors decided that he was &quot;so indispensable that, despite his longing for action in Europe, he was retained in Somaliland until 1920.&quot;

In Somaliland, the Camel Corps and other British soldiers were ordered to subdue an uprising by Mohammed Abdullah Hassan, known by the British as the &quot;Mad Mullah&quot;, who had been fighting against them for more than twenty years. Ismay&#x27;s commander, Thomas Cubitt, was determined to end the rebellion forcefully and quickly, so on 17 November 1914, he launched a major assault against Hassan&#x27;s fortress at Shimber Berris. In the attack, Ismay fought closely alongside Adrian Carton de Wiart, later an important British officer in both World Wars. Not long after the attack on Shimber Berris, however, the Camel Corps received orders from London &quot;forbidding all offensive operations in Somaliland&quot;, due to the misfortunes of the Army elsewhere. As a result of this order, British operations were limited for the duration of the First World War, and Ismay&#x27;s unit undertook no further major offensives.

Despite limited British activity, a few operations combined with the effort of local forces led to &quot;a drastic weakening&quot; of Hassan&#x27;s forces by 1918. Thus, after the armistice ending the First World War, the government sent Major General Arthur Hoskins to take control of the forces in Somaliland and defeat Hassan conclusively in battle. After Hoskins arrived, his initial plan for dealing with Hassan focussed on the use of the newly formed Royal Air Force, so Ismay and the Camel Corps were consigned to a minor role. Hoskins&#x27;s plans, however, were found &quot;overscaled and far too costly&quot;, so they were shelved throughout most of 1918 and 1919.

In October 1919, plans for Hoskins&#x27;s operation were finally approved, and on 21 January 1920, the attack against Hassan commenced. After several days of bombing, Ismay was ordered to lead an assault by the Camel Corps against Hassan&#x27;s fortress at Jid Ali. On , Ismay&#x27;s forces first attempted the attack and were repulsed by strong resistance. That night, however, Hassan and his forces fled Jid Ali to take refuge in the countryside. Ismay was assigned to track down and capture Hassan, but he &quot;had no idea of where he was&quot;, and was forced to begin a large search.

Ismay pursued Hassan for nearly two weeks, and managed to capture many members of his family and people close to him, including seven of his sons. Hassan himself managed to evade Ismay and on , the effort to capture him was called off. Though Hassan was never captured, his power was broken, and he died in December 1920 of influenza. For his service in the effort against Hassan, Ismay received the Distinguished Service Order and was twice mentioned in despatches.

==Interwar years==
In April 1920, Ismay left Somaliland for England. While en route, he received word that he had been nominated for a place at the Indian Army&#x27;s Staff College, Quetta. Depressed by the loss of life and destruction of the First World War, Ismay turned down the nomination, and &quot;was even seriously thinking of resigning [his] commission&quot; in the Army. After arriving in London, Ismay was given twelve months of medical leave, and decided to stay in the army. He then attempted to reclaim his seat at the Staff College, but was told that it had already been given to someone else.

===Marriage and service in India===
While on medical leave, Ismay met Laura Kathleen Clegg, with whom he quickly fell in love. The two were engaged only three weeks after meeting. After four months, however, Ismay was proclaimed fit for duty, despite his remaining eight months of leave, and ordered back to India, where he rejoined his old regiment. His time back in India was relatively quiet, as there was &quot;no serious fighting&quot; in the area of his regiment at the time. In February 1921, Ismay took the qualifying exam for the Staff College in Rawalpindi, and passed, earning himself a seat for the next year.

In April, Ismay returned to London on leave, and married Clegg, with whom he eventually had three daughters. Ismay remained in London until February 1922, when he entered the Staff College at Quetta. Ismay excelled at the Staff College, and its commandant called him &quot;one of the two best, if not the best, of the students who have passed through my hands.&quot; In his final thesis at the Staff College, Ismay correctly predicted that the next European war would be a total war, but he incorrectly predicted that cavalry would continue to play a role in future warfare.

After the Staff College, Ismay became Deputy Assistant Quartermaster General of the Indian Army. In that position, he worked closely with Claude Auchinleck, beginning a long-standing personal and professional relationship between the two. Ismay found that his work as Deputy Assistant Quartermaster General &quot;was a valuable experience&quot;, but did not enjoy it.

===Service in England===

In 1924, Air Vice-Marshal Philip Game suggested to Ismay that he apply for a seat at the RAF Staff College, Andover. Although Ismay &quot;had no desire to learn to be a pilot&quot;, he was happy for the opportunity to return to England, and went to study at the college. After completing the programme, he was approached about the possibility of serving as an Assistant Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence (CID) under Maurice Hankey. Ismay gladly accepted the position, starting work in December 1925. In the six months between finishing the Staff College and beginning at the CID, Ismay returned to India and held a staff position at the headquarters of the Indian Army in Simla.

As Assistant Secretary, Ismay directed several of the CID&#x27;s subcommittees, including those for Censorship and War Emergency Legislation, Principal Supply Officers, and Co-ordination of Departmental Action. As the Secretary of the Committee for the Co-ordination of Departmental Action, Ismay &quot;was responsible for seeing that all plans and preparations made by Government Departments or sub-committees of the CID to meet the eventuality of war, were incorporated under appropriate headings in a document known as the War Book.&quot; This task ended up consuming most of Ismay&#x27;s time as Assistant Secretary, and gave him &quot;exceptional insight into the ways of Whitehall.&quot;

While serving as Assistant Secretary, Ismay made important friends and gained the backing of Hankey, by whom he was &quot;greatly valued&quot;. Largely through Hankey&#x27;s influence, Ismay was nominated as a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the Civil Division, an honour which he received in 1931.

===Lord Willingdon and the War Office===
In December 1930, after five years, Ismay left his position at the CID. He was promoted colonel and hoped to take command of the 12th Cavalry. Instead, he became the military secretary for Lord Willingdon, the newly appointed Viceroy of India.

In this role, Ismay served as the &quot;unofficial link&quot; between Willingdon and the Indian Army. He also led Willingdon&#x27;s personal staff, and organised his many trips throughout India. Ismay was also responsible for Willingdon&#x27;s safety, and took precautions after he was threatened by assassins. In December 1932, Ismay was informed that his service with Willingdon was over and that he was expected to take up a position in the War Office during the next year.

At the War Office, Ismay served as an intelligence officer with responsibility for the Middle East, Far East, the Americas, the Soviet Union, Poland and the Baltic States. Ismay enjoyed his work, and wrote that &quot;intelligence is perhaps the most interesting of all Staff work.&quot; During his three years in the position, Ismay worked directly under Sir John Dill, who would later serve as the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.

==Committee of Imperial Defence==
In 1936, Maurice Hankey became determined to &quot;bring Ismay in as his deputy and eventual successor&quot; at the CID. Hoping that the appointment would &quot;strengthen the organization of the CID&quot; and enhance its influence, Hankey offered Ismay the position of Deputy Secretary. Although the appointment meant that Ismay would probably never command troops again, he viewed it as an important opportunity and &quot;accepted with scarcely a moment&#x27;s hesitation.&quot; A week thereafter, Ismay received a letter offering him the command of a cavalry brigade in India, but declined, solidifying his choice to remain a staff officer.

As Deputy Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence, Ismay had broad responsibilities, and was &quot;concerned with every aspect of planning and preparation for a war which seemed imminent.&quot; Ismay dealt extensively with a variety of matters and focussed much of his attention on the preparation of anti-aircraft defences and co-ordination among the military services. As the crisis in Europe escalated, however, Hankey announced his intention to retire in June 1938. Hankey hoped that one person, preferably Ismay, would inherit all of the positions he had occupied, including Secretary of the CID, clerk of the Privy Council, and secretary to the Cabinet, but the prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, decided that the positions should be split and assigned to different people.

In the end, Ismay was named only to the position of Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence, effective 1 August 1938. Ismay assumed the position scarcely more than a year before the outbreak of the Second World War, and the war totally dominated his time in office. Soon after Ismay took office, Hitler initiated a crisis over the Sudetenland. While Chamberlain was at the Munich Conference attempting to resolve the crisis, Ismay ordered the digging of trenches in London as protection against air attacks, should war occur. Ismay later said that he thought Britain should have gone to war at Munich instead of waiting, but said nothing at the time. As it became increasingly clear that war was inevitable in 1939, Ismay also prepared for a &quot;smooth, simple and practically instantaneous&quot; transition from the Committee of Imperial Defence to the War Cabinet, or whatever other wartime authority the government might choose.

==Second World War==
With the outbreak of the Second World War, the CID was immediately absorbed into the War Cabinet as Ismay had planned. In the midst of the turmoil, Ismay was promoted to major-general, and began to work closely with Chamberlain, accompanying him on a visit to France in December 1939. Ismay disagreed with several Allied strategic choices, including the decision to try to stop the German advance in Belgium, but kept his doubts to himself.

===Chiefs of Staff Committee===

In April 1940, Winston Churchill took control of the Military Co-ordination Committee, charged with overseeing all of the military services. He selected Ismay as his chief staff officer, which also gave Ismay the additional responsibility of serving on the Chiefs of Staff Committee. While serving under Churchill had been a life-long dream for Ismay, he was initially sceptical about the duties of his new position, which seemed unclear and poorly defined.

On 10 May, after the beginning of the Battle of France, Chamberlain resigned, and Churchill became both prime minister and minister of defence. Ismay, who later called Churchill &quot;the greatest War Prime Minister in our history&quot;, was &quot;thrilled&quot; by this development, and continued to act as Churchill&#x27;s chief staff officer and military adviser. According to Churchill, the two developed a close &quot;personal and official connection [that] was preserved unbroken and unweakened&quot; throughout the war.

As part of this relationship, not long after Churchill became prime minister, he arranged for Ismay to be appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in June 1940. From the very moment he became prime minister, Churchill &quot;relied heavily on General Pug Ismay,&quot; who provided a crucial bridge to the military establishment. Ismay served as the &quot;principal assistant to Mr. Churchill in his capacity as Minister of Defence&quot;, continued to serve as the secretary of the Imperial Defence Chiefs of Staff Committee, and became Deputy Secretary of the War Cabinet.

Ismay was crucial to running the war effort, as he was able to effectively link the military and civilian leadership. Jock Colville, Churchill&#x27;s private secretary, wrote that Ismay had the &quot;tact, patience, and skill in promoting compromise&quot; needed to keep the war running smoothly.&quot; Ismay had the additional advantage of being admired by the Service Chiefs for his long and distinguished record as a soldier.

In his role, Ismay handled &quot;nearly all military messages&quot; from Churchill to the Service Chiefs. Ismay also gave Churchill advice on military matters, and often &quot;begged him to be reasonable&quot; when he contemplated foolish actions, believing that Churchill&#x27;s greatest fault was his &quot;impetuous nature and impatience with opposition.&quot; When the Chiefs of Staff found Churchill&#x27;s demands unfeasible, Ismay took the role of &quot;converting the Prime Minister&quot; to their viewpoint.

===Allied conferences===
As Churchill&#x27;s chief military adviser, Ismay frequently attended wartime conferences and meetings of the Allies and accompanied other British leaders, such as Foreign Minister Anthony Eden, on their travels. Ismay&#x27;s travel to the conferences began in 1941, when he went with Lord Beaverbrook to the first Moscow Conference. Because British participation in the conference was a secret, Ismay faked influenza to explain his absence from London while it was taking place. The Conference was also the first time that Ismay worked closely with the Americans, whom he found &quot;quite congenial.&quot;

Ismay would continue to work closely with the Americans throughout the remainder of the war, and he accompanied Churchill on his 1942 trip to the United States. Shortly after their return, US General Dwight D. Eisenhower arrived in Britain to command the American forces. He established close relations with Ismay, who liked him greatly, and assisted him in co-ordinating with both British forces and the Cabinet. Eisenhower thought highly of Ismay, remembering him for his &quot;stalwart support&quot;, and noting, &quot;He was one of those men whose great ability condemned him throughout the war to a staff position. Consequently his name may be forgotten; but the contributions he made to the winning of the war were equal to those of many whose names became household words.&quot;

Not long after Eisenhower arrived, on 16 August 1942, Ismay was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general. Around the same time, his good relations with the Americans were recognised by others in the government. Thus, in November 1942, when Eleanor Roosevelt visited Britain, Lady Ismay was chosen to host her for one night of her stay.

===1943 conferences===
In January 1943, Ismay accompanied Churchill to the Casablanca Conference. Ismay attended nearly all of the proceedings of the Conference, and helped work towards consensus where the Americans and British disagreed on issues. Ismay was also appointed to the committee which wrote the formal report of the conference. After the conference, Ismay visited the American headquarters in Algiers to meet with Eisenhower, and helped resolve some differences of opinion between Eisenhower and his British colleagues.

After Casablanca, Ismay accompanied Churchill to the third Washington Conference in May 1943. At the conference, Ismay first met the American admiral William D. Leahy, who is often described as his American counterpart. The two developed a friendly relationship, and Leahy wrote in his memoirs: &quot;General Sir Hastings Ismay became my favorite, perhaps because his position closely paralleled my own&quot;.

After the Washington Conference came the Quebec Conference in August 1943. Once again, Ismay attended along with Churchill. The Quebec Conference was the first time that the Allied leaders discussed the full details of Operation Overlord, so Ismay spent much of his time explaining details of the operation to Churchill and other leaders. During the conference, Ismay also observed that Dudley Pound &quot;had had a breakdown&quot;. He took the information to Churchill who demanded Pound&#x27;s resignation a week later.

Shortly after returning from Quebec, Ismay participated in his next conference, travelling with Anthony Eden to the Moscow Conference in October and November, where he served as Eden&#x27;s top military adviser. At the conference, Ismay handled all of the Soviet questions about the planning for Operation Overlord, and met Joseph Stalin personally for the first time. After the conference, Ismay wrote that he &quot;was optimistic about [sic] post-war relations with Russia&quot;, showing his belief that the meeting had gone well.

Only four days after returning from the Moscow Conference, Ismay left England again for the Cairo Conference and Teheran Conference with Churchill. One major source of conflict at the Cairo Conference was an American proposal to appoint an overall commander for the strategic bombing of Germany. Ismay and the British were strongly opposed, and Ismay wrote a long paper against the idea, which became the basis of British policy on the subject. At Teheran, Ismay helped to argue the case for Operation Overlord, but immediately after the conference he developed bronchitis and returned to England by ship, scrapping his other plans for the trip.

===1944–1945===
In the first several months of 1944, Ismay spent almost all of his time planning for the Normandy Landings. As part of the planning, Ismay personally coordinated the plans for Operation Bodyguard and Operation Fortitude, which were designed to deceive the Germans about the planned Normandy landings. In March, Duncan Sandys, Churchill&#x27;s son-in-law, told Ismay that Basil Liddell Hart, a noted strategist and historian, had somehow discovered the secret plans for the Normandy landings. This development had the potential to compromise the entire operation, so Ismay personally interviewed Liddell Hart, who claimed to have simply &quot;worked it all out for himself&quot; without any access to secret information. After their interview, Ismay directed the matter to the MI5, who never found evidence of wrongdoing, although it is suspected that Liddell Hart may in fact have received information from military planners.

On 20 May 1944, less than a month before the Normandy Landings were scheduled to take place, Ismay was promoted to the rank of full general. After the successful D-Day landings, King George VI decided to visit the troops in Normandy, and selected Ismay to accompany him on the visit. In September, Ismay accompanied Churchill to the Second Quebec Conference. Ismay also accompanied Churchill on his visits to Moscow and Paris in late 1944.

In February 1945, Ismay attended the Yalta Conference. He found the conference different from the previous ones where &quot;the military element had been the prima donna, occupying the centre of the stage.&quot; Instead, at Yalta, political issues took precedence, leaving Ismay and other military advisers &quot;waiting for calls that never came&quot;.

On VE Day, Ismay found it &quot;quite impossible to be completely happy about the future,&quot; due to the lingering Japanese threat, and the rising threat of the Soviet Union. Nonetheless, he was happy to be one of only three men to hold the same high government position throughout the war in Europe, along with Edward Bridges, 1st Baron Bridges and the King.

==Post-war military service==
After VE Day, Ismay accompanied Churchill to the Potsdam Conference. Like Yalta, the conference focussed primarily on political issues, so there was little for Ismay to do. After Clement Attlee defeated Churchill in the 1945 election, becoming prime minister, Ismay kept his position, working with Attlee at the conference, but remained loyal to Churchill. Ismay and Churchill remained friends for the remainder of their lives, and Ismay even helped Churchill write his memoirs, reviewing and commenting on each chapter of his manuscript.

Shortly after the Potsdam Conference, the war in Asia ended on VJ Day. After this victory, Ismay &quot;would have liked to retire at once&quot;, but at Attlee&#x27;s request he remained in the military for another year. Before continuing work, however, Ismay travelled to New York on 6 September, for a six-week vacation; he received a warm welcome.

Over the next year, Ismay worked largely on the issue of reform for the Ministry of Defence. From December 1945 to February 1946, Ismay worked with a small committee to draft the &quot;Statement Relating to Defence&quot;, which formed the basis of reforms implemented by Attlee later that year. For his role, Ismay became known as the &quot;&#x27;chief architect&#x27; of the post-war Ministry of Defence.&quot;

During the year following the war, Ismay received many honours for his service. In August 1945, as part of Churchill&#x27;s resignation honours, he was appointed to the Order of the Companions of Honour, an honour rarely bestowed on soldiers. The next January, he received the Legion of Merit from the United States. He was promoted Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in June. Finally, he was named the chairman of the Council of the Royal National Institute for the Blind.

In November 1946, Ismay announced his intention to retire. Attlee accepted his retirement, effective on 31 December 1946. Immediately after retiring, in the 1947 New Year Honours, Ismay was created a baron taking the title Baron Ismay, of Wormington in the County of Gloucester. He accepted the barony and took his seat in the House of Lords in February.

==Partition of India==

Shortly after Ismay&#x27;s retirement, Lord Mountbatten of Burma was appointed as the last British Viceroy of India and Ismay offered to serve as his chief of staff. Thus, in March 1947, Ismay left with Mountbatten for India to help preside over its transition to independence. After arriving in India, Ismay soon came to the conclusion that the situation there was dire, heading for civil war, and told Mountbatten that &quot;India was a ship on fire in mid-ocean with ammunition in her hold.&quot;

When Ismay and Mountbatten arrived, they were committed to preserving a unified India, but Ismay soon realised &quot;that the Moslem League would not agree to any plan which did not provide for the creation of Pakistan as an independent sovereign state.&quot; In April, after several unsuccessful meetings with Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Mountbatten came to the same conclusion and began drawing up plans for the partition.

Over the next month Mountbatten finalised his partition plan, and on , he sent Ismay back to London to present it to the British government. Ismay presented the plan to the Prime Minister and Cabinet, casting partition as a Hobson&#x27;s choice. Ismay stayed in England for the next month, and helped to alter the plan based on the cabinet&#x27;s suggestions, before returning to India on .

Once the partition plan had been accepted, Ismay worked on implementing the details. In particular, Ismay dealt with the issue of dividing the Indian Army. Based on his own experiences and love of the Indian Army, Ismay did his &quot;utmost to persuade&quot; the leaders of the new Indian and Pakistani states not to separate the army immediately. His efforts failed due to the opposition of Jinnah.

Ismay also travelled to Kashmir to ask Hari Singh to hold an immediate referendum over whether his territory would join India or Pakistan. Once again, Ismay was unsuccessful and Singh &quot;changed the subject&quot; each time that Ismay tried to discuss the referendum. Throughout the period immediately following independence, Ismay also tried to ensure that stories printed in the Indian and Pakistani press about the partition were accurate, but once again he was largely unsuccessful.

The situation in India continued to deteriorate throughout the summer and autumn of 1947. Nevertheless, Ismay and Mountbatten had agreed that Ismay would remain in his position for only three to four months after partition. In December 1947, he left India to return to England. Shortly after his return, Ismay served briefly on the British delegation to the United Nations to deal with the Kashmir issue. Ismay played only a limited role, as the Pakistanis suspected him of pro-Indian sympathies.

==Festival of Britain==
Shortly after Ismay returned from the United Nations, Prime Minister Attlee asked him to become the chairman of the Council of the Festival of Britain, scheduled to take place in 1951. Ismay accepted the offer, and on 10 March 1948, he officially took the position of chairman. The appointment was largely symbolic, and Ismay &quot;was at least partly appointed to forestall potential criticism by his friend Winston Churchill.&quot; - according to Leventhal. The Council, however, wielded &quot;slight, but not insignificant influence&quot; and Ismay took his duties seriously.

Ismay helped to ensure that the festival would be truly national in character, rather than just confined to London. As such, in June 1949, he called together all of the mayors in Britain to discuss the festival; this was the first meeting of all British mayors since 1916. Ismay also publicly defended the large cost of the festival, and emphasised its historic nature, saying, &quot;We are consciously and deliberately determined to make history.&quot; Once the festival opened, Ismay hosted various notable guests, including Margaret Truman, the daughter of US president Harry Truman.

==Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations==
In the 1951 general election held shortly after the conclusion of the Festival of Britain, Churchill&#x27;s Conservative Party once again won a majority in Parliament, making Churchill Prime Minister for a second time. The day after the election, Churchill asked Ismay to become the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations in his cabinet. Ismay &quot;was overjoyed at the prospect of serving under Churchill again&quot; and accepted the post immediately. Although not a politician, Ismay was well-suited for the position because of his close relationships with the leaders of the commonwealth countries, largely the result of his work during the war.

As a result of his military background and experience, Ismay became &quot;more closely involved in defence matters than is usual for a Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations,&quot; and often served as de facto minister of defence and serving as temporary minister of defence until the permanent appointee, Harold Alexander, was able to take office. Through his close involvement in defence matters, Ismay began to be involved with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. In January 1952, he accompanied Churchill to a meeting in Ottawa about the alliance, and in February 1952 he attended the NATO Lisbon Conference as the British Ministry of Defence representative. When leaving the conference, Ismay remarked to Alfred Gruenther, &quot;this is the first that I have seen of NATO, and thank heaven it&#x27;s the last.&quot;

==Secretary General of NATO==
At the Lisbon Conference, the members of NATO agreed to appoint a secretary general who would direct the organisation&#x27;s staff and serve as Vice-Chairman of the North Atlantic Council. The position was initially offered to Sir Oliver Franks, but he declined. As such, the allies scrambled to find someone else to take the position. Two weeks later, the countries agreed to ask Ismay to become secretary general at the suggestion of Churchill and Anthony Eden.

Eden asked Ismay to accept the position, but his response &quot;was an immediate and emphatic negative,&quot; as he saw NATO as an overly bureaucratic and inefficient organisation and complained that the position of Secretary General was &quot;divided and ill-defined.&quot; Churchill then personally asked Ismay to accept the position, telling him that &quot;NATO provided the best, if not the only, hope of peace in our time.&quot; After further urging, Ismay reluctantly agreed to take the job. On , the Atlantic Council officially passed a resolution appointing Ismay Secretary General, and he started work on .

Ismay&#x27;s appointment to the position was well-received, enjoying the unanimous support of all the NATO members. The press and public also responded favourably. &quot;The Times&quot; wrote: &quot;of all the candidates whose names have been mentioned, Lord Ismay would seem to have the strongest qualifications for the post.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; applauded his &quot;vast experience in military planning, strategy, and administration,&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that Ismay would bring NATO &quot;great authority, experience and energy and a personal charm that can dissolve difficulties.&quot;

As the first Secretary General, Ismay was &quot;assuming an entirely new role in the history of international organizations,&quot; and as such he helped to define the position itself. While Ismay &quot;deemed it wise not to step too boldly in a political role&quot; in disputes among the members, he asserted himself strongly on issues relevant to the organisation of NATO. From the very beginning of his time in office, Ismay worked to empower the permanent representatives to NATO, and emphasised that they had the same legal authority to make decisions as the NATO foreign ministers.

Ismay was also a proponent of NATO expansion, saying that NATO &quot;must grow until the whole free world gets under one umbrella.&quot;
However, before the Warsaw Pact was even put in place, he opposed the request to join NATO made by the USSR in 1954
 saying that &quot;the Soviet request to join NATO is like an unrepentant burglar requesting to join the police force&quot; thus making apparent that NATO alliance (&quot;the police force&quot;) was directed against the USSR. As stated in the official NATO website &quot;the request tested the limits of NATO&#x27;s willingness to admit new members&quot;.

As secretary general, Ismay also worked to encourage closer political co-ordination among the members of the alliance. During the Suez Crisis he offered his good offices to help resolve issues among members of the alliance. Ismay also offered to help mediate disputes over Cyprus.

In December 1956, Ismay decided to retire from NATO. He told the press that &quot;he was not giving up his position for personal reasons, but because he felt it needed a fresh hand and a fresh brain.&quot; Paul-Henri Spaak was immediately chosen as his successor, but Ismay remained in office until May 1957, when he left with &quot;the affection and respect&quot; of all the NATO members. While Secretary General, Ismay is also credited as having been the first person to say that the purpose of NATO was &quot;to keep the Soviet Union out, the Americans in, and the Germans down,&quot; a saying that has since become a common way to quickly describe the alliance.

==Retirement==

Immediately after leaving NATO, Ismay was honoured by Queen Elizabeth II with an appointment to the Order of the Garter. His youngest daughter Mary had married George Seymour, equerry to Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, and their daughter Katharine is a god-daughter of Princess Margaret.

He was appointed to boards of several corporations including the Ashanti Goldfields Corporation. Ismay also began writing his memoirs, &quot;The Memoirs of General Lord Ismay&quot;, which were published in 1960 by Viking Press. In his memoirs, Ismay focussed principally on his Second World War service, and as such, one reviewer called them &quot;a most significant addition to the literature of the Second World War.&quot;

In 1963, Ismay was again asked to assist in a review of the organisation of the British military along with Sir Ian Jacob. Although Ismay was ill throughout most of the review and did relatively little of the work, &quot;his influence was strong&quot;, and the final product of the review largely reflected his opinions. In the end, the Ismay–Jacob Report recommended strengthening the central power of the Ministry of Defence substantially, and in 1964, Parliament implemented its recommendations.

Ismay died on 17 December 1965 at his home Wormington Grange, Gloucestershire, at the age of 78. As he had no male heir, his title became extinct.

<text>The flags of the U.S. states, territories, and the District of Columbia (Washington, D.C.) exhibit a variety of regional influences and local histories, as well as different styles and design principles. Modern U.S. state flags date from the turn of the 20th century, when states considered distinctive symbols for the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. Most U.S. state flags were designed and adopted between 1893 and World War I.

The most recently adopted state flag is that of Minnesota, adopted on May 11, 2024, while the most recently adopted territorial flag is that of the Northern Mariana Islands, adopted on July 1, 1985. The flag of the District of Columbia was adopted in 1938. Recent legislations in Massachusetts (2021) and Illinois (2024) have started the process of redesigning their state flag. Michigan also has plans to redesign their flag in the future, but this has not been confirmed. Maine had put a flag redesign on the ballot in November 2024, but the redesign had failed the vote.

Despite a variety of designs, the majority of the states&#x27; flags share the same design pattern consisting of the state seal superimposed on a monochrome 
background, commonly a shade of blue, which remains a source of criticism from vexillologists. According to a 2001 survey by the North American Vexillological Association, New Mexico has the best-designed flag of any U.S. state, U.S. territory, or Canadian province, while Georgia&#x27;s state flag was rated the worst (the latter of which has been changed since the survey was conducted).

==Native American flags==


Many Native American nations have tribal sovereignty, with jurisdiction over their members and reserved land. Although reservations are on state land, the laws of the state(s) do not necessarily apply. Below are the flags of some of the largest Indian tribes reservations by population and area:

== Unofficial flags of United States Minor Outlying Islands ==
The U.S. national flag is the official flag for all islands, atolls, and reefs composing the United States Minor Outlying Islands. However, unofficial flags are sometimes used to represent some of these insular areas:

<doc id="421704" wikidata="Q13529989" url="?curid=421704" title="Michael Mates">
<text>Michael John Mates (born 9 June 1934) is a Conservative Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of East Hampshire from 1974 to 2010. He was a minister at the Northern Ireland Office from 1992 to 1993, resigning after his support for failed businessman (and later convicted thief) Asil Nadir damaged his reputation. After his long career at Westminster, Mates lost the election for police commissioner in Hampshire in August 2012.

==Early life and education==
Mates was born on 9 June 1934 in Brentford, Middlesex, England. He was educated at Salisbury Cathedral School, Blundell&#x27;s School and King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he was a choral scholar.

==Career==
===Military, 1955–1974===
On 18 June 1955, Mates was commissioned into the Royal Ulster Rifles, British Army, as a second lieutenant. On 1 February 1957, he was promoted to lieutenant. On 3 January 1959, he transferred from a short service commission to a regular commission.

On 10 March 1961, Mates transferred from the Royal Ulster Rifles to 1st The Queen&#x27;s Dragoon Guards. He was promoted to captain on 9 June 1961, and to major on 31 December 1967.

Prior to his election to the House of Commons, Mates served for twenty years in the British Army leaving in 1974 with the rank of lieutenant colonel with the 1st The Queen&#x27;s Dragoon Guards.

===Parliament, 1974–2010===
Michael Mates was a Member of Parliament for 35 years. He was first elected in the October 1974 general election for Petersfield in Hampshire, following the retirement of Joan Quennell. The constituency was renamed East Hampshire in 1983 and he continued to serve as MP until the 2010 general election, having announced his intention in 2006 not to stand again.

From 1992 to 1993, Mates was Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office. He resigned after a scandal involving his links to fugitive businessman Asil Nadir. In his 28-minute resignation speech he defied Commons Speaker Betty Boothroyd by attacking the Serious Fraud Office’s handling of the case against Nadir in breach of Commons rules on &quot;sub judice&quot;. Nadir was eventually convicted in the case of ten counts of theft amounting to £29m. 

Mates served as the chairman of the Defence (1987–1992) and Northern Ireland (2001–2005) select committees and chaired the All-Party Anglo-Irish Parliamentary Group. He was appointed a member of the Privy Council in February 2004.

===Police Commissioner candidacy, 2012===
In July 2012 Mates was selected as the Conservative candidate in the election for Police and crime commissioner for Hampshire, notwithstanding his links to Asil Nadir who, in August 2012 was convicted of theft amounting to £29m. In the 1990s, when a junior minister in the Northern Ireland Office, Mates expressed his support for Nadir by sending him a watch inscribed with the words &quot;don&#x27;t let the buggers get you down&quot; – a reference to an ongoing investigation into Nadir&#x27;s fraudulent financial activities by British authorities. In August 2012 Nadir was found guilty at the Old Bailey of fraud, and convicted of stealing nearly £29 million. Despite this Mates maintained his support for Nadir, including testifying in his defence at the Old Bailey.

In September 2012 Michael Crick of &quot;Channel 4 News&quot; said that Mates had repeatedly refused to answer questions about a windfall he received having vacated a sitting tenancy at Dolphin Square, central London, when an MP. Two city councillors publicly stated that he should step down, while Conservative MP George Hollingbery, who oversaw the party&#x27;s selection process for the commissioner candidates, said: &quot;Michael Mates was selected after a transparent process involving both the public and party members. Michael is a candidate with a wealth of experience in high public office and the party believes he will make an excellent first police commissioner.&quot;

In 2012 Mates was reported to Hampshire Constabulary for electoral fraud under the Fraud Act 2006 by competitor Don Jerrard who was standing for The Justice &amp; Anti-Corruption Party. The former lawyer wrote to the county&#x27;s Chief Constable alleging that Mates breached the 2006 Fraud Act by giving his address as a house where he rents rooms in Winchester. Parallel to this, Hampshire police confirmed two complaints of alleged racist language in Mates&#x27; Election Statement were passed to the Thames Valley Police for investigation.
Thames Valley Police were said to be getting ready to interview Mates, but it was not known whether this would be done under caution. Mates denied the allegations, saying he was the victim of a smear campaign.
In 2014 Mates received an apology and undisclosed damages from the Crown Prosecution Service. He also received an apology from Hampshire Constabulary. Mates described the 18 months between the allegations and his vindication as &quot;a nightmare&quot;.

==Controversies==
The Panama Papers revealed that Mates was minority shareholder of an offshore investment company named Haylandale Limited from 2005 to at least April 2010, the end of his parliamentary period, and owned four subsidiary firms from August 2007 to December 2008 for leasing and services connected to luxury properties in The Bahamas. Mates had, however, previously declared that he was the remunerated Chairman of Haylandale, which undertook property development in the West Indies, in the Register of Members&#x27; Interests for the period of 2005 to 2010.

==Personal life==
Michael Mates has been married three times: to Mary Rosamund Paton in 1959, divorced 1980; Rosellen Bett in 1982, divorced 1995; and Christine Robinson-Moltke in 1998. He is the father of James Mates, a senior reporter and presenter for ITN.

Partnered by composer William Godfree, Mates regularly performs tributes to Flanders and Swann, Noël Coward and others in aid of charity.

<text>James Francis Murphy (born 23 August 1967) is a Scottish former politician who served as Leader of the Scottish Labour Party from 2014 to 2015 and Secretary of State for Scotland from 2008 to 2010. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for East Renfrewshire, formerly Eastwood, from 1997 to 2015. He identifies as a social democrat and has expressed support for a foreign policy of Western interventionism. He has been described as being on the political right of the Labour Party.

Born in Glasgow, Murphy&#x27;s family moved to South Africa in 1980. After returning to Scotland, he became involved in student politics and became Scotland&#x27;s youngest MP at the age of 29. Murphy served in the New Labour governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown as Parliamentary Secretary for the Cabinet Office from 2005 to 2006, Minister of State for Employment and Welfare Reform from 2006 to 2007 and Minister of State for Europe from 2007 to 2008. From 2008 to 2010, Murphy served in the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Scotland. After Labour lost the 2010 general election, Murphy served in Ed Miliband&#x27;s Shadow cabinet as Shadow Secretary of State for Defence and Shadow Secretary of State for International Development.

Following Johann Lamont&#x27;s resignation, Murphy was elected Leader of the Scottish Labour Party in the 2014 leadership election. He led Scottish Labour into the 2015 general election, in which he said, &quot;I will not lose a single seat to the SNP&quot; before the party lost 40 of its 41 seats during a landslide victory for the Scottish National Party (SNP), who won 56 of the 59 seats in Scotland. After surviving a vote of no confidence, Murphy announced in May 2015 he would step down as leader that June. The subsequent leadership contest was won by his deputy leader Kezia Dugdale.

==Early life and career==
Murphy was born in Glasgow and raised in a flat in Arden. He was educated at St Louise&#x27;s Primary School, followed by Bellarmine Secondary School in Glasgow until 1980, when, after his father became unemployed, he and his family emigrated to Cape Town, South Africa. In Cape Town, he attended Milnerton High School.

In 1985, Murphy returned to Scotland aged 17 to avoid service in the South African Defence Force. He studied Politics and European Law at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow but failed to graduate. During sabbaticals from his studies, he held the posts of President of both NUS Scotland and NUS. He dropped out of university to become the youngest Scottish MP at the age of 29.

During his time at university, Murphy was elected President of the Scottish National Union of Students, one of the &quot;special region&quot; organisations within the NUS, serving from 1992 until 1994. Murphy then took a further sabbatical from university in 1994 to serve as the President of the National Union of Students, an office which he held from 1994 to 1996, during which time he was a member of Labour Students. As NUS President, he also served, ex officio, as a Director of Endsleigh Insurance from 1994 to 1996.

In 1995, the NUS dropped its opposition to the abolition of the student grant. Murphy was condemned by a House of Commons early day motion, introduced by Ken Livingstone and signed by 13 other Labour MPs, for &quot;intolerant and dictatorial behaviour&quot; regarding Clive Lewis&#x27; suspension. He was elected for a second term as NUS President, serving until 1996. He then became special projects manager of the Scottish Labour Party.

== Early parliamentary career ==
Murphy was selected to stand as the Labour Party candidate in the seat of Eastwood at the 1997 general election. He was elected as MP for Eastwood on 1 May 1997, winning the formerly safe Conservative seat with a majority of 3,236 as Scotland&#x27;s youngest MP.

From 1999 to 2001, Murphy was a member of the Public Accounts Select Committee, which oversees public expenditure. In February 2001, he was appointed as the Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to Helen Liddell, the Secretary of State for Scotland, after the resignation of Frank Roy over the Carfin Grotto fiasco. Upon becoming a PPS, he stood down from his previous other roles as the Vice Chair of the Labour Party&#x27;s Treasury, Northern Ireland and Culture, Media and Sport Committees.

At the 2001 general election he was re-elected as MP for Eastwood, with an increased majority of 9,141. In late 2001 he suggested bombing the poppy fields of Afghanistan to try to destroy the opium crop. In June 2002, he was appointed as a government whip, with responsibility for the Scotland Office and the Northern Ireland Office. His responsibilities were expanded in November 2002 to include the Department of Trade and Industry, and again in June 2003 to cover the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Development. He was the Chair of the Labour Friends of Israel from 2001 to 2002.

== In government ==

=== Junior government minister ===
For the 2005 general election, the Eastwood constituency was renamed East Renfrewshire, although the boundaries were unchanged. Murphy was re-elected with a majority of 6,657 and subsequently promoted to ministerial rank as the Parliamentary Secretary for the Cabinet Office. His responsibilities in that role included the promotion of e-government, better regulation and modernising public services. In January 2006, he was the government minister responsible for introducing the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006 in the House of Commons. The act was controversial because of a perception it was an enabling act substantially removing the ancient British constitutional restriction on the executive introducing and altering laws without assent or scrutiny by Parliament. The bill proved unpopular with MPs and the Green Party but received royal assent on 8 November 2006.

Murphy was promoted in May 2006 to become Minister of State for Employment and Welfare Reform. He oversaw the Welfare Reform Act 2007 and told a conference in Edinburgh the housing benefit changes and employment and support allowance would help single parents and older citizens back into work. The act was criticised over the involvement of private insurers in its drafting and as being part of a wider move towards workfare and a disability policy based around Work Capability Assessment. His reforms helped lay the foundations for the policies of subsequent Conservative governments, which saw thousands of people with health conditions and disabilities dying within six weeks of being declared fit for work.

Murphy was promoted to Minister of State for Europe in June 2007. He helped to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon, which was confirmed on 16 July 2007. The stated aim of the treaty was to &quot;complete the process started by the Treaty of Amsterdam [1997] and by the Treaty of Nice [2001] with a view to enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the Union and to improving the coherence of its action.&quot; He was commended for his commission of the &quot;Engagement: Public Diplomacy in a Globalised World&quot; collection of essays, organised with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

=== Secretary of State for Scotland ===
In October 2008, Prime Minister Gordon Brown appointed Murphy to the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Scotland, with additional responsibility for retaining Scottish seats at the next general election. He was also appointed to the Privy Council. In 2009, he apologised &quot;on behalf of all politicians&quot; for the expenses scandal. He was also the cabinet minister responsible for co-ordinating Pope Benedict&#x27;s visit to the UK in 2010 – which was the first ever state visit by a Pope to the UK.

== Shadow Cabinet ==

=== Shadow Secretary of State for Defence ===
At the 2010 general election, the Labour Party held every seat they had won in Scotland in 2005, although they lost the election overall. Murphy was subsequently one of the two campaign managers for David Miliband&#x27;s failed bid for the leadership of the Labour Party, along with Douglas Alexander. Following the election of Ed Miliband, Murphy was appointed Shadow Secretary of State for Defence on 8 October 2010. Also in 2010, &quot;The Herald&quot; awarded him with the title of &quot;Best Scot at Westminster&quot; for a second year in a row, having given him the title for the first time in 2009.

In 2011, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; published leaked US diplomatic cables stating that throughout 2009, Murphy had a leading role in organising the support of opposition parties in promoting the implementation of the Commission on Scottish Devolution&#x27;s recommendations. The aim was to &quot;block an independence referendum&quot; in Scotland.

As Shadow Defence Secretary, Murphy criticised moves to boycott Israel, stating that the Labour Party&#x27;s policy was to avoid participation in boycotts. He praised the &quot;vital&quot; role of NATO during the military intervention in the 2011 Libyan crisis resolution, stating that Libya had been set &quot;on a path to censure, democratic and peaceful future&quot;. He also criticised the scrapping of the Rolls-Royce Nimrod, stating it was &quot;probably the most expensive technically capable aircraft in our history&quot; and it had been treated &quot;like second hand car sent to scrap&quot; despite its usefulness in defence.

Murphy co-chaired the review of the Labour Party in Scotland with Sarah Boyack, commissioned by Ed Miliband in May 2011 in response to the landslide victory by the Scottish National Party in the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, which reported in August of that year.

On 3 July 2013, Murphy criticised the Unite trade union for &quot;bullying&quot; and &quot;overstepping the mark&quot; for allegedly interfering with the selection of a candidate in Falkirk. A Labour Party investigation later cleared Unite of any wrongdoing.

Murphy voted against the restriction of housing benefit for those in social housing deemed to have excess bedrooms, otherwise known as the &quot;Bedroom Tax&quot;, in favour of allowing same sex marriage and against capping discretionary working age benefits, allowing them to rise in line with prices.

=== Shadow Secretary of State for International Development ===
In 2013, Murphy was moved to the post of Shadow Secretary of State for International Development in a &quot;purge of Blairites&quot; by Ed Miliband. His unease with the Labour leader&#x27;s decision to oppose military action in Syria may have contributed to the move. He stated he had agreed to take a more prominent role in the Better Together campaign to keep Scotland in the UK. Murphy told a radio show in October 2013 that female soldiers should be able to serve in combat roles. In March 2014, Murphy criticised FIFA for the management of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, citing the &quot;sub-human working conditions&quot; he saw when visiting the worker camps for the Qatar stadiums.

=== Expenses ===
A 2010 commission chaired by Thomas Legg demanded Murphy repay £577.46 in expenses which he had overclaimed. He did not appeal, and repaid the money in full. Expenses documents made available showed he also claimed over £1 million between 2001 and 2012. In 2007/8 he claimed £3,900 for food, £2,284 for petty cash and £4,884 for a new bathroom. He claimed £249 for a TV set and a further £99 for a TV stand; £1762.50 of taxpayers money paid for Murphy&#x27;s website whilst further claims included Labour party adverts in the local press. He claimed almost £2000 of public cash to pay private accountants to handle his tax returns.

In 2012, Murphy was among a group of 27 MPs named as benefiting from up to £20,000 per year expenses to rent accommodation in London, at the same time as letting out property they owned in the city. Although the practice did not break rules, it has been characterised as a &quot;loophole&quot; that allows politicians to profit from Commons allowances. He also designated his constituency home in Glasgow as his second home for which he claimed £780 a month in mortgage interest payments in 2007/2008.

==Scottish independence referendum campaign==
During the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, Murphy gained prominence in the media for his role in the &quot;No&quot; campaign, due to his &quot;100 Streets in 100 Days&quot; tour. He briefly suspended the tour on 28 August 2014, after an egg was thrown at him by a member of the public in Kirkcaldy. Video evidence showed members of the public wearing &#x27;Yes&#x27; campaign insignias berating him as he spoke. He claimed this was the result of an orchestrated attack by mobs of protesters organised by the Yes Scotland campaign in a deliberate attempt to intimidate him. The man responsible was a local resident who was a supporter of Scottish independence, who alleged that Jim Murphy had not answered a question asked of him. Pleading guilty to assault, he apologised for &#x27;bringing the Yes campaign into disrepute unintentionally&#x27;.

Murphy was awarded The Spectator&#x27;s Campaigner of the Year prize for his role in the &#x27;No&#x27; campaign during the independence debate.

==Leader of the Scottish Labour Party==

===Election to leadership and early activities===
Following Johann Lamont&#x27;s resignation as Leader of the Scottish Labour Party, Murphy announced that he would be a candidate in the election to replace her, alongside Neil Findlay MSP and Sarah Boyack MSP. He resigned from the Labour Party Shadow Cabinet in November 2014 to focus on his campaign. &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s Kevin McKenna argued Murphy&#x27;s tour during the 2014 referendum campaign &quot;wasn&#x27;t really about his new-found enthusiasm for the union... [but] was, instead, a three-month job interview for the post of leader of the Labour party in Scotland&quot;. In announcing his candidacy, Murphy stated he would end the electoral losing streak of Labour in Scotland, creating a revival similar to Tony Blair&#x27;s return to power in 1997 in the UK. On 13 December 2014, Murphy was elected as Leader of the Scottish Labour Party, having secured 56% of the vote under the party&#x27;s electoral college system.

In December 2014, Murphy stated he was in favour for alcohol ban at Scottish football matches to be overturned on a trial basis. Mhari McGowan, representing Assist, a domestic violence support organisation, called the proposal &quot;absolutely crazy&quot;. Ruth Davidson of the Conservative Party had previously called for a review of the policy in 2013.

In February 2015, Murphy claimed that four times as many NHS operations were being cancelled in Scotland as in England. When it emerged that the claim was based on a misreading of the statistics, Murphy had to delete a YouTube video and a message on social media he had made capitalising on the false claim.

In March 2015, citing figures from &quot;The Guardian&quot; on the low rate of Scotland&#x27;s poorest pupils going to university, Murphy confirmed that higher education tuition would remain free for Scottish students.

===2015 general election===

On his election as party leader Murphy said he was determined under his leadership Labour would not lose any MPs to the SNP in the British general election of May 2015. On 27 February 2015, Murphy announced that he would again stand for the Westminster parliamentary seat of East Renfrewshire in the election. In the run-up to the 2015 general election, Murphy predicted that a late swing would save Labour in spite of unfavourable polls. During his campaign, the SNP suspended two members of their party after it emerged that they had disrupted Murphy&#x27;s speeches with fellow campaigner Eddie Izzard.

During Murphy&#x27;s time as leader he took part in a debate at Glasgow University with Nicola Sturgeon, Ruth Davidson and Willie Rennie. During the debate the panel were asked about their stance on drugs, mainly if drug laws should be devolved to the Scottish Parliament and what their individual experiences with drugs were. When the panel were questioned if they had ever tried cannabis, Jim Murphy stated that &quot;in the housing scheme where I grew up, glue sniffing was the thing&quot;.

On 7 May 2015, the Scottish National Party won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats at Westminster and Scottish Labour lost 40 of the 41 seats it was defending. Murphy lost his own East Renfrewshire seat to the SNP&#x27;s Kirsten Oswald, leading to calls for his resignation.

Murphy, his chief of staff John McTernan and strategy head Blair McDougall were criticised for their role in Labour&#x27;s defeat. Criticism was made of Labour party resources in Scotland being assigned to favoured candidates such as Alexander and Curran. Murphy stated that the loss was due to &quot;an absence of ideas&quot; rather than a &quot;lack of passion&quot;, and referenced Labour&#x27;s additional defeats in England as another factor affecting the party&#x27;s success. Following his defeat, he said he would remain Leader of Scottish Labour, despite calls for his resignation.

In spite of surviving a vote of no confidence by 17 votes to 14 at a party meeting in Glasgow, Murphy announced on 16 May 2015 that he intended to step down as Leader of the Scottish Labour Party in June. At the same press conference Murphy also stated that he wanted to have a successor as leader in place by the summer, and confirmed he would not be standing for a seat at the Scottish Parliament in the 2016 election. He added that Scottish Labour was the &quot;least modernised part of the Labour movement&quot;, and commented that problem with the Labour party lay not with the trade unionists, but with Len McCluskey, leader of Unite, whose behaviour he described as &quot;destructive&quot;.

Murphy&#x27;s resignation took effect on 1 June 2015. While Kezia Dugdale, as Deputy Leader of Scottish Labour, would normally have acted as leader until a permanent leader was elected, former Scottish Labour Leader Iain Gray became acting leader as Dugdale resigned the Deputy Leadership in order to run for the Leadership vacated by Murphy.

==Political positions and views==

Murphy identifies as a social democrat and has expressed sympathy for democratic socialism but has been described as being on the political right of the Labour Party. He has frequently been referred to as a Blairite but has claimed the term is outdated.

Murphy is on the Political Council of the Henry Jackson Society, whose outlook has been described variously as neoliberal and as neoconservative. The Society is also known for its reports related to Islamic and far-right extremism. The Society is named after the American politician Henry M. Jackson. As Shadow Secretary of State for Defence, he gave a speech at an HJS event entitled &#x27;A New Model for Intervention: How the UK Responds to Extremism in North and West Africa and Beyond’, arguing for the UK to remain engaged in defence policy beyond its borders, while learning lessons from past experiences.

In January 2015, the Scottish National Party (SNP) and Scottish Greens called on Murphy to resign from the Henry Jackson Society. In response the Henry Jackson Society reaffirmed its cross-partisan nature, saying &quot;we believe ... the broadest possible coalition of politicians – of which Jim Murphy is just one of 15 Labour parliamentarians to do so through our political advisory council – should engage with such ideas [of foreign policy].&quot;

==Post-parliament career==
Following the disastrous results for Scottish Labour at the 2015 general election, Murphy established Arden Strategies, a political lobbying firm, and became an advisor to the Finnish non-profit Crisis Management Initiative (CMI), advising on &quot;conflict resolution in central Asia&quot;. Murphy and Arden Strategies have been described as &quot;leading power players&quot; in the current Labour government, organising business events and fundraisers for candidates in the run up to the 2024 general election.

In November 2016, Murphy took up an employed position as an adviser to former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.

In August 2018, Murphy paid for a full-page advert in the &quot;Jewish Telegraph&quot; in which he criticised Jeremy Corbyn for what he claimed was the party&#x27;s failure to root out Antisemitism. The article, which appeared on page three of the paper under the headline &quot;In sorrow and anger - an apology&quot;, accused Corbyn and his top team of being &quot;intellectually arrogant, emotionally inept and politically maladroit&quot;.

==Personal life==
Murphy is married with three children – Cara, Matthew and Daniel. He captained the Parliamentary Football Team. He is a practising Roman Catholic. He is also a vegetarian and a teetotaller. He is the author of &quot;The Ten Football Matches That Changed The World...And The One That Didn&#x27;t.&quot;

Murphy was passing near to the Clutha Pub in Stockwell Street in Glasgow on the night of 29 November 2013, shortly after a Police Scotland helicopter crashed onto the roof of the pub, killing 10 people and injuring 31 others. He was later interviewed about the aftermath of the accident.

<text>A curb extension (or also neckdown, kerb extension, bulb-out, bump-out, kerb build-out, nib, elephant ear, curb bulge, curb bulb, or blister) is a traffic calming measure which widens the sidewalk for a short distance. This reduces the crossing distance and allows pedestrians and drivers to see each other when parked vehicles would otherwise block visibility. The practice of banning car parking near intersections (with or without a curb extension) is referred to as [[intersection daylighting|daylighting]] the intersection.

A curb extension is formed by an angled narrowing of the roadway and a widening of the sidewalk. This is often accompanied by an area of enhanced restrictions (such as a &quot;no stopping&quot; or &quot;no parking&quot; zone) and the appropriate visual reinforcement. This is achieved using painted road markings (e.g. lines, coloured areas, or chevrons), barriers, bollards, or the addition of pavement or street furniture (e.g. planters, street lights, or benches).

Curb extensions are often used in combination with other traffic calming measures such as chicanes, speed bumps, or rumble strips, and are frequently sited to protect formal pedestrian crossings. In these cases the &quot;squeeze&quot; effect of the narrowed roadway shortens the exposed distance pedestrians must walk.

==Uses==
Curb extensions are used to:
* Increase the visibility of pedestrians by enforcing the &quot;daylighting&quot; of the intersection and encouraging pedestrians to wait in a more visible area.
* Reduce crossing distances for pedestrians.
* Provide space for ramps on the sidewalk where it would otherwise be too narrow.
* Slow down traffic by visually narrowing the roadway and reducing the turning radius of drivers. This is especially useful for calming fast traffic turning from a major to a minor road.
* Shield parallel parked vehicles from oncoming traffic.
* Protect passengers embarking and particularly disembarking from trams, buses, and level-grade urban light rail systems, particularly when retrofitting existing streets. In other words, curb extensions prevent buses from needing to pull over to side of the road to release and receive passengers.
* Provide protection for pedestrians, possibly by including a pedestrian barrier, preventing pedestrians from running straight from the premises over the road.
* Provide room for U-turns on superstreets.

Curb extensions are also used when retrofitting existing streets to accommodate congestion charging schemes - hitherto wide (sometimes multi-lane) roads are deliberately narrowed to ensure that the charging equipment can see passing vehicles, and the charging equipment (and often bollards or other barrier devices) are placed in the expanded sidewalk area (to prevent drivers from circumventing the charging system&#x27;s cameras and detectors).

==Design, advantages and disadvantages==
The Pedestrian and Bicycle Information Center, a body funded by the US Federal Highway Administration, advises that curb extensions ought not encroach on travel lanes, bicycle lanes, or shoulders, and should not extend more than 1.8 m (6 ft) from the curb. Some curb extensions are built with the bike lane passing through (making the extension an island, separated from the main sidewalk by a narrow bike lane).

One study has found that pedestrians crossing at curb extensions have to wait for fewer vehicles to pass before a motorist yields to allow them to cross. The study was too small to determine whether other measures of effectiveness were significant, such as percent of pedestrians crossing after a motorist yields.

Poorly designed curb extensions can pose a hazard to cyclists, as they force cyclists from their position at the road side (or in a roadside bike lane) into the narrowed gap. They can also damage vehicles if the curbs extend too close to traffic lanes.

Author Randal O&#x27;Toole argues that curb extensions are used to discourage the use of automobiles by reducing the number of lanes available for automobiles. In particular, curb extensions can be used to block turn lanes, forcing turning vehicles to remain with the forward moving traffic. Curb extensions do prevent drivers from using parking lanes or shoulders as right turn lanes.

However, reducing the crossing distance also reduces the time needed to cross the street. This allows a reduction in the length of the pedestrian phase at signalized intersection, and reduces the time needed to yield to pedestrians at stop sign controlled intersections. This at least partially compensated for any loss in vehicle capacity.

Curb extensions complicate drainage. They obstruct the gutter, so a catch basin is needed at the uphill end to keep a puddle from forming. An alternate solution is placing a gap in the curb, allowing the stormwater in the gutter to irrigate a rain garden or bioswale in the curb extension.

To facilitate street sweeping, the internal and external curvatures of the extended curb section are moderately graduated.

Retroactively adding curb extensions to older, established communities has been controversial in some instances, due to the installation of the extensions reducing the availability of on-street parking for some properties, particularly in cases where the curb extension has been installed on its own and not in conjunction with a crosswalk.

<doc id="421709" wikidata="Q275618" url="?curid=421709" title="Occupation of Czechoslovakia (1938–1945)">
<text>The military occupation of Czechoslovakia by Nazi Germany began with the German annexation of the Sudetenland in 1938, continued with the creation of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, and by the end of 1944 extended to all parts of Czechoslovakia.

Following the &quot;Anschluss&quot; of Austria in March 1938 and the Munich Agreement in September of that same year, Adolf Hitler annexed the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia on 1 October, giving Germany control of the extensive Czechoslovak border fortifications in this area. The incorporation of the Sudetenland into Germany left the rest of Czechoslovakia with a largely indefensible northwestern border. Also a Polish-majority borderland region of Trans-Olza which was annexed by Czechoslovakia in 1919, was occupied and annexed by Poland following the two-decade long territorial dispute. Finally the First Vienna Award gave to Hungary the southern territories of Slovakia and Carpathian Ruthenia, mostly inhabited by Hungarians.

The Slovak State broke off on 14 March 1939, and Hungary annexed the remainder of Carpathian Ruthenia the following day. On 15 March, during a visit to Berlin, the Czechoslovak president Emil Hácha was coerced into signing away his country&#x27;s independence. On 16 March, Hitler proclaimed the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia from Prague Castle, leaving Hácha as the nominal, but almost powerless, State President. Czechoslovakia was occupied by the Wehrmacht, and real power was vested in Hitler&#x27;s personal representative, the Reichsprotektor. 

During the occupation, between 294,000 to 320,000 citizens were murdered, the majority of them Jews. Reprisal killings were especially harsh after the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich, including the infamous Lidice massacre. Large numbers were drafted for slave labour in Germany.

In March 1944 Germany extended the occupation of Czechoslovakia to Hungary in Operation Margarethe, then to Slovakia in August 1944 following the Slovak National Uprising. The occupation ended with the surrender of Germany at the end of World War II. 

==The economic crisis in Germany==
Hitler&#x27;s interest in Czechoslovakia was largely economic. Germany had the second-largest economy in the world, but German agriculture was not capable of feeding the population, and there was also a lack of many raw materials, which had to be imported. The Four-Year Plan that Hitler had launched in September 1936 to have the German economy ready for a &quot;total war&quot; by 1940 had seriously strained the German economy by 1937 as German government was forced to use up its foreign exchange reserves both to feed its own people and to import various raw materials to achieve the ambitious armament goals of the Four Year Plan. Though the Four Year Plan aimed at autarky, there were certain raw materials such as high-grade iron, oil, chrome, nickel, tungsten, and bauxite that Germany did not have and had to be imported. The need to import food and raw materials made Germany into Europe&#x27;s second largest importer, being exceeded only by Great Britain. Moreover, hundreds of millions of &quot;Reichsmarks&quot; were spent on various armament works such as the &quot;Reichswerke&quot; steel complex, an expensive program to develop synthetic fuel, and various other equally expensive chemical and aluminum programs, all of which strained the German economy. The Great Depression was an era of trade wars and protectionism, which imposed limits on Germany&#x27;s ability to export and thus earn foreign exchange. Moreover, the Four Year Plan with its aim of autarky led to Germany increasing its tariffs, which led other nations to do likewise in retaliation. The British historian Richard Overy wrote the huge demands of the Four Year Plan &quot;...could not be fully met by a policy of import substitution and industrial rationalisation&quot;, thus leading Hitler to decide in November 1937 that to stay ahead in the arms race with the other powers that Germany had to seize Czechoslovakia in the near-future.

At the Hossbach conference on 5 November 1937, Hitler announced that seizing Czechoslovakia would increase the supply of food under German control, which in turn would lessen the need to import food, thereby freeing up more foreign exchange to import raw materials necessary for the Four Year Plan&#x27;s targets. The Hossbach conference was largely taken up with an extended discussion about the necessity of bringing areas adjunct to Germany under German economic control, by force if necessary, as Hitler argued that this was the best way to win the arms race. Hitler stated: &quot;areas producing raw materials can be more usefully sought in Europe, in immediate proximity to the &quot;Reich&quot;&quot;. Overy wrote about Hitler&#x27;s attitude to the &quot;Reich&quot; economic problems that: &quot;He simply saw war instrumentally, as the Japanese had done in Manchuria, as a way to expand the German resource base and to secure it against other powers&quot;.

At the time, Czechoslovakia had Europe&#x27;s 7th largest economy, and easily the most modern, developed, and industrialized economy in Eastern Europe. The former Austrian provinces of Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia that now comprise the modern Czech Republic had been the industrial heartland of the Austrian empire, where the majority of the arms for the Imperial Austrian Army were manufactured, most notably at the Škoda Works. One consequence of this legacy was that Czechoslovakia was the only nation in Eastern Europe besides the Soviet Union that manufactured its own weapons instead of importing them, and Czechoslovakia was the world&#x27;s 7th largest manufacturer of arms, making Czechoslovakia an important player in the global arms trade.

==Demands for Sudeten autonomy==

Sudeten German pro-Nazi leader Konrad Henlein offered the Sudeten German Party (SdP) as the agent for Hitler&#x27;s campaign. Henlein met with Hitler in Berlin on 28 March 1938, where he was instructed to raise demands unacceptable to the Czechoslovak government led by president Edvard Beneš. On 24 April, the SdP issued the Karlsbader Programm, demanding autonomy for the Sudetenland and the freedom to profess National Socialist ideology. If Henlein&#x27;s demands were granted, the Sudetenland would be an autonomous state aligned with Nazi Germany.

==Munich Agreement==

As the tepid reaction to the German &quot;Anschluss&quot; with Austria had shown, the governments of France, the United Kingdom and Czechoslovakia were set on avoiding war at any cost. The French government did not wish to face Germany alone and took its lead from the British government, led by Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. He contended that Sudeten German grievances were justified and believed that Hitler&#x27;s intentions were limited. That made Britain and France advise Czechoslovakia to concede to the German demands. Beneš resisted, and on 20 May 1938, a partial mobilisation was under way in response to the possible German invasion. It is suggested that the mobilisation could have been launched on basis of Soviet misinformation about Germany being on verge of invasion, which aimed to trigger war in Western Europe.

On 30 May, Hitler signed a secret directive for war against Czechoslovakia to begin no later than 1 October.

In the meantime, the British government demanded for Beneš to request a mediator. Not wishing to sever his government&#x27;s ties with Western Europe, Beneš reluctantly accepted. The British appointed Lord Runciman and instructed him to persuade Beneš to agree to a plan acceptable to the Sudeten Germans. On 2 September, Beneš submitted the Fourth Plan, which granted nearly all of the demands of the Karlsbader Programm. Intent on obstructing conciliation, however, the SdP held demonstrations that provoked the police in Ostrava on 7 September. The Sudeten Germans broke off negotiations on 13 September, and violence and disruption ensued. As Czechoslovak troops attempted to restore order, Henlein flew to Germany, and on 15 September, he issued a proclamation demanding the takeover of the Sudetenland by Germany.
The same day, Hitler met with Chamberlain and demanded the swift takeover of the Sudetenland by Nazi Germany under threat of war. Czechoslovakia, Hitler claimed, was slaughtering the Sudeten Germans. Chamberlain referred the demand to the British and French governments, both of which accepted. The Czechoslovak government resisted by arguing that Hitler&#x27;s proposal would ruin the nation&#x27;s economy and ultimately lead to German control of all of Czechoslovakia. The United Kingdom and France issued an ultimatum and made a French commitment to Czechoslovakia contingent upon its acceptance. On 21 September, Czechoslovakia capitulated. The next day, however, Hitler added new demands that insisted for the claims of Poland and Hungary to be satisfied as well. Romania was also invited to share in the division of Carpathian Ruthenia but refused because it was an ally of Czechoslovakia (see Little Entente).

The Czechoslovak capitulation precipitated an outburst of national indignation. In demonstrations and rallies, Czechs and Slovaks called for a strong military government to defend the integrity of the state. A new cabinet, under General Jan Syrový, was installed, and on 23 September 1938, a decree of general mobilization was issued. The Czechoslovak Army was modern, had an excellent system of frontier fortifications and was prepared to fight. The Soviet Union announced its willingness to come to Czechoslovakia&#x27;s assistance. Beneš, however, refused to go to war without the support of the Western powers.

Hitler gave a speech in Berlin on 26 September 1938 and declared that the Sudetenland was &quot;the last territorial demand I have to make in Europe&quot;. He also stated that he had told Chamberlain, &quot;I have assured him further that, and this I repeat here before you, once this issue has been resolved, there will no longer be any further territorial problems for Germany in Europe!&quot;

On 28 September, Chamberlain appealed to Hitler for a conference. Hitler met the next day at Munich with the chiefs of governments of France, Italy and Britain. The Czechoslovak government was neither invited nor consulted. On 29 September, the Munich Agreement was signed by Germany, Italy, France and Britain. The Czechoslovak government capitulated on 30 September, despite the army&#x27;s opposition, and agreed to abide by the agreement, which stipulated that Czechoslovakia must cede Sudetenland to Germany. The German occupation of the Sudetenland would be completed by 10 October. An international commission representing Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Czechoslovakia would supervise a plebiscite to determine the final frontier. Britain and France promised to join in an international guarantee of the new frontiers against unprovoked aggression. Germany and Italy, however, would not join in the guarantee until the Polish and Hungarian minority problems were settled.

On 5 October 1938, Beneš resigned as president since he realised that the fall of Czechoslovakia was a &quot;fait accompli&quot;. After the outbreak of World War II, he would form a Czechoslovak government-in-exile in London.

==First Vienna Award==

In early November 1938, under the First Vienna Award, which was a result of the Munich agreement, Czechoslovakia—which had failed to reach a compromise with Hungary and Poland—had to cede after the arbitration of Germany and Italy awarded southern Slovakia and Carpathian Ruthenia to Hungary, while Poland invaded Trans-Olza territory shortly after.

As a result, Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia lost about 38% of their combined area to Germany, with some 3.2 million German and 750,000 Czech inhabitants. Hungary, in turn, received in southern Slovakia and southern Carpathian Ruthenia; according to a 1941 census, about 86.5% of the population in this territory was Hungarian. Meanwhile, Poland annexed the town of Český Těšín with the surrounding area (some ), some 250,000 inhabitants, Poles making up about 36% of population, and two minor border areas in northern Slovakia, more precisely in the regions Spiš and Orava. (, 4,280 inhabitants, only 0.3% Poles).

Soon after Munich, 115,000 Czechs and 30,000 Germans fled to the remaining rump of Czechoslovakia. According to the Institute for Refugee Assistance, the actual count of refugees on 1 March 1939 stood at almost 150,000.

On 4 December 1938, there were elections in Reichsgau Sudetenland, in which 97.32% of the adult population voted for the National Socialist Party. About 500,000 Sudeten Germans joined the National Socialist Party, which was 17.34% of the German population in Sudetenland (the average National Socialist Party participation in Nazi Germany was 7.85%). This means the Sudetenland was the most pro-Nazi region in Nazi Germany. Because of their knowledge of the Czech language, many Sudeten Germans were employed in the administration of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and in Nazi organizations such as the &quot;Gestapo&quot;. The most notable was Karl Hermann Frank, the SS and police general and Secretary of State in the Protectorate.

==Second Republic (October 1938 to March 1939)==
The greatly weakened Czechoslovak Republic was forced to grant major concessions to the non-Czechs. The executive committee of the Slovak People&#x27;s Party met at Žilina on 5 October 1938, and with the acquiescence of all Slovak parties except the Social Democrats formed an autonomous Slovak government under Jozef Tiso. Similarly, the two major factions in Subcarpathian Ruthenia, the Russophiles and Ukrainophiles, agreed on the establishment of an autonomous government, which was constituted on 8 October. Reflecting the spread of modern Ukrainian national consciousness, the pro-Ukrainian faction, led by Avhustyn Voloshyn, gained control of the local government and Subcarpathian Ruthenia was renamed Carpatho-Ukraine. In 1939, during the occupation, the Nazis banned Russian ballet.

A last-ditch attempt to save Czechoslovakia from total ruin was made by the British and French governments, who on 27 January 1939, concluded an agreement of financial assistance with the Czechoslovak government. In this agreement, the British and French governments undertook to lend the Czechoslovak government £8 million and make a gift of £4 million. Part of the funds were allocated to help resettle Czechs and Slovaks who had fled from territories lost to Germany, Hungary, and Poland in the Munich Agreement or the Vienna Arbitration Award.

In November 1938, Emil Hácha, who succeeded Beneš, was elected president of the federated Second Republic, renamed Czecho-Slovakia and consisting of three parts: Bohemia and Moravia, Slovakia, and Carpatho-Ukraine. Lacking its natural frontier and having lost its costly system of border fortification, the new state was militarily indefensible. Without the natural defensive barrier of the mountains of the Sudetenland, Hácha carried out a foreign policy that was slavishly pro-German as he felt this was the best way to preserve his nation&#x27;s independence.

In late 1938-early 1939, the continuing economic crisis caused by problems of rearmament, especially the shortage of foreign hard currencies needed to pay for raw materials Germany lacked together with reports from Hermann Göring that the Four Year Plan was hopelessly behind schedule forced Hitler in January 1939 to reluctantly order major defense cuts with the Wehrmacht having its steel allocations cut by 30%, aluminum 47%, cement 25%, rubber 14% and copper 20%. On 30 January 1939, Hitler made his &quot;Export or die!&quot; speech calling for a German economic offensive or &quot;export battle&quot; to use Hitler&#x27;s term to increase German foreign exchange holdings to pay for raw materials for the Four Year Plan without cutting back on food imports. Hitler&#x27;s wish to occupy Czechoslovakia was primarily caused by the foreign exchange crisis as Germany had run down its foreign exchange reserves by early 1939, and Germany urgently needed to seize the gold of the Czechoslovak central bank to continue the Four Year Plan. On 8 March 1939, Hitler met with Wilhelm Keppler, the NSDAP&#x27;s economic expert, where he spoke about his wish to occupy Czecho-Slovakia for economic reasons, saying that Germany needed its raw materials and industries.

Hitler totally ignored the agreements of the Munich Agreement and scheduled a German invasion of Bohemia and Moravia for the morning of 15 March. In the interim, he negotiated with the Slovak People&#x27;s Party and with Hungary to prepare the dismemberment of the republic before the invasion. On 13 March, he invited Tiso to Berlin and on 14 March, the Slovak Diet convened and unanimously declared Slovak independence. Carpatho-Ukraine also declared independence but Hungarian troops occupied and annexed it on 15 March and a small part of eastern Slovakia as well on 23 March.

===14 March===
After the secession of Slovakia and Ruthenia, British Ambassador to Czechoslovakia Basil Newton advised President Hácha to meet with Hitler. When Hácha arrived in Berlin on 14 March, he met with the German Foreign Minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop prior to meeting with Hitler. Von Ribbentrop testified at the Nuremberg trials that during this meeting, Hácha had told him that &quot;he wanted to place the fate of the Czech State in the Führer&#x27;s hands.&quot; Hácha later met with Hitler, where Hitler gave the Czech President two options: cooperate with Germany, in which case the &quot;entry of German troops would take place in a tolerable manner&quot; and &quot;permit Czechoslovakia a generous life of her own, autonomy and a degree of national freedom...&quot; or face a scenario in which &quot;resistance would be broken by force of arms, using all means.&quot; Minutes of the conversation noted that for Hácha this was the most difficult decision of his life but believed that in only a few years this decision would be comprehensible and in 50 years would probably be regarded as a blessing. After the negotiations had finished, Hitler told his secretaries, &quot;It is the greatest triumph of my life! I shall enter history as the greatest German of them all.&quot;

According to Joachim Fest, Hácha suffered a heart attack induced by Hermann Göring&#x27;s threat to bomb the capital and by four o&#x27;clock he contacted Prague, effectively &quot;signing Czechoslovakia away&quot; to Germany. Göring acknowledged making the threat to the British ambassador to Germany, Nevile Henderson, but said that the threat came as a warning because the Czech government, after already agreeing to German occupation, could not guarantee that the Czech army would not fire on the advancing Germans. Göring, however, does not mention that Hácha had a heart attack because of his threat. French Ambassador Robert Coulondre reported that according to an unnamed, considered a reliable source by Coulondre, by half past four, Hácha was &quot;in a state of total collapse, and kept going only by means of injections.&quot;

===15–16 March===
On the morning of 15 March, German troops entered the remaining Czech parts of Czechoslovakia (&quot;Rest-Tschechei&quot; in German), meeting practically no resistance (the only instance of organized resistance took place in Místek where an infantry company commanded by Karel Pavlík fought invading German troops). The Hungarian invasion of Carpatho-Ukraine encountered resistance but the Hungarian army quickly crushed it. On 16 March, Hitler went to the Czech lands and from Prague Castle proclaimed the German protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. The British historian Victor Rothwell wrote that the Czechoslovak reserves of gold and hard currency seized in March 1939 were &quot;invaluable in staving off Germany&#x27;s foreign exchange crisis&quot;. In addition, the Germans seized all of the factories for making weapons, mines that provided crucial raw materials for the armament program of the Four Year Plan and a &quot;huge weapons haul, including nearly 500 tanks and nearly 1600 aircraft&quot;.

Besides violating his promises at Munich, the annexation of the rest of Czechoslovakia was, unlike Hitler&#x27;s previous actions, not described in &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;. After having repeatedly stated that he was interested only in pan-Germanism, the unification of ethnic Germans into one &quot;Reich&quot;, Germany had now conquered seven million Czechs. Hitler&#x27;s proclamation creating the protectorate on 16 March claimed that &quot;Bohemia and Moravia have for thousands of years belonged to the &quot;Lebensraum&quot; of the German people&quot;. British public opinion changed drastically after the invasion. Chamberlain realised that the Munich Agreement had meant nothing to Hitler. Chamberlain told the British public on 17 March during a speech in Birmingham that Hitler was attempting &quot;to dominate the world by force&quot;.

==Second World War==
===The Arsenal of the &quot;Reich&quot;===
Shortly before World War II, Czechoslovakia ceased to exist. Its territory was divided into the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, the newly declared Slovak State and the short-lived Republic of Carpathian Ukraine. While much of former Czechoslovakia came under the control of Nazi Germany, Hungarian forces swiftly overran the Carpathian Ukraine. Hungary annexed some areas (e.g., Southern Slovakia and Carpathian Ruthenia) in the autumn of 1938. Poland reclaimed Zaolzie previously illegally annexed by Czech during Polish-Soviet war in 1920. The Zaolzie region became part of Nazi Germany after the German invasion of Poland in September 1939.

The German economy—burdened by heavy militarisation—urgently needed foreign currency. Setting up an artificially high exchange rate between the Czechoslovak &quot;koruna&quot; and the &quot;Reichsmark&quot; brought consumer goods to Germans (and soon created shortages in the Czech lands).

Czechoslovakia had fielded a modern army of 35 divisions and was a major manufacturer of machine guns, tanks, and artillery, most of them assembled in the Škoda factory in Plzeň. Many Czech factories continued to produce Czech designs until converted to German designs. Czechoslovakia also had other major manufacturing companies. Entire steel and chemical factories were moved from Czechoslovakia and reassembled in Linz (which incidentally remains a heavily industrialized area of Austria). In a speech delivered in the Reichstag, Hitler stressed the military importance of occupation, noting that by occupying Czechoslovakia, Germany gained 2,175 field cannons, 469 tanks, 500 anti-aircraft artillery pieces, 43,000 machine guns, 1,090,000 military rifles, 114,000 pistols, about a billion rounds of ammunition and three million anti-aircraft shells. This amount of weaponry would be sufficient to arm about half of the then Wehrmacht.
Czechoslovak weaponry later played a major part in the German conquests of Poland (1939) and France (1940).

Heydrich during his time as &quot; Reichsprotektor&quot; brought about increases in rations for workers in the armaments industry, improved welfare services, free shoes and for a short time, a five-day work week as Saturday was made a holiday. The National Union of Employees was remolded in the style of the Nazi pseudo-union, the German Labour Front, to provide free sports events, films, concerts and plays for the workers. Heydrich sought to portray himself as the friend of the Czech working class, even meeting a group of selected Czech workers on 24 October 1941 in a photo-op to show his supposed concern for the Czech workers. Heydrich cynically called his policy &quot;optical effects&quot; as he believed that mere gestures such as free showings of films at the local cinemas and free sports matches could win the support of the working class and increase productivity in the war industries. However, inflation was rampant and wage increases failed to keep up with the cost of living, causing the workers to frequently grumble about their conditions.

===Czechoslovak resistance===

Beneš—the leader of the Czechoslovak government-in-exile—and František Moravec—head of Czechoslovak military intelligence—organized and coordinated a resistance network. Hácha, Prime Minister Alois Eliáš, and the Czechoslovak resistance acknowledged Beneš&#x27;s leadership. Active collaboration between London and the Czechoslovak home front was maintained throughout the war years. The most important event of the resistance was Operation Anthropoid, the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich, SS leader Heinrich Himmler&#x27;s deputy and the then Protector of Bohemia and Moravia. Infuriated, Hitler ordered the arrest and execution of 10,000 randomly selected Czechs. Over 10,000 were arrested, and at least 1,300 were executed. According to one estimate, 5,000 were killed in reprisals. The assassination resulted in one of the most well-known reprisals of the war. The Nazis completely destroyed the villages of Lidice and Ležáky; all men over 16 years from the village were murdered, and the rest of the population was sent to Nazi concentration camps where many women and nearly all the children were killed.

The Czechoslovak resistance comprised four main groups:

* The army command coordinated with a multitude of spontaneous groupings to form the Defense of the Nation (&quot;Obrana národa&quot;, ON) with branches in Britain and France. Czechoslovak units and formations with Czechs (c. 65–70%), and Slovaks (c. 30%) served with the Polish Army (Czechoslovak Legion), the French Army, the Royal Air Force, the British Army (the 1st Czechoslovak Armoured Brigade), and the Red Army (I Czechoslovak Corps). Two thousand eighty-eight Czechs and 401 Slovaks fought in 11th Infantry Battalion-East alongside the British during the war in areas such as North Africa and Palestine. Among others, Czech fighter pilot, Sergeant Josef František was one of the most successful fighter pilots in the Battle of Britain.
* Beneš&#x27;s collaborators, led by , created the Political Center (&quot;Politické ústředí&quot;, PÚ). The PÚ was nearly destroyed by arrests in November 1939, after which younger politicians took control.
* Social democrats and leftist intellectuals, in association with such groups as trade unions and educational institutions, constituted the Committee of the Petition that We Remain Faithful (&quot;Petiční výbor Věrni zůstaneme&quot;, PVVZ).
* The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSČ) was the fourth major resistance group. The KSČ had been one of over 20 political parties in the democratic First Republic, but it had never gained sufficient votes to unsettle the democratic government. After the Munich Agreement, the leadership of the KSČ moved to Moscow and the party went underground. Until 1943, however, KSČ resistance was weak. The 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, a non-aggression agreement between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, had left the KSČ in disarray. But ever faithful to the Soviet line, the KSČ began a more active struggle against the Germans after Operation Barbarossa, Germany&#x27;s attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941.

The democratic groups—ON, PÚ, and PVVZ—united in early 1940 and formed the Central Committee of the Home Resistance (&quot;Ústřední výbor odboje domácího&quot;, ÚVOD). Involved primarily in intelligence gathering, the ÚVOD cooperated with a Soviet intelligence organization in Prague. Following the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, the democratic groups attempted to create a united front that would include the KSČ. Heydrich&#x27;s appointment in the fall thwarted these efforts. By mid-1942, the Germans had succeeded in exterminating the most experienced elements of the Czechoslovak resistance forces.

Czechoslovak forces regrouped in 1942–1943. The Council of the Three (R3)—in which the communist underground was also represented—emerged as the focal point of the resistance. The R3 prepared to assist the liberating armies of the U.S. and the Soviet Union. In cooperation with Red Army partisan units, the R3 developed a guerrilla structure.

Guerrilla activity intensified with a rising number of parachuted units in 1944, leading to the establishment of partisan groups such as 1st Czechoslovak Partisan Brigade of Jan Žižka, Jan Kozina Brigade or Master Jan Hus Brigade, and especially after the formation of a provisional Czechoslovak government in Košice on 4 April 1945. &quot;National committees&quot; took over the administration of towns as the Germans were expelled. More than 4,850 such committees were formed between 1944 and the end of the war under the supervision of the Red Army. On 5 May, a national uprising began spontaneously in Prague, and the newly formed Czech National Council almost immediately assumed leadership of the revolt. Over 1,600 barricades were erected throughout the city, and some 30,000 Czech men and women battled for three days against 40,000 German troops backed by tanks, aircraft and artillery. On 8 May, the German &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; capitulated; Soviet troops arrived on 9 May.

===German policy===
There are sources that highlighted the more favorable treatment of the Czechs during the German occupation in comparison to the treatment of the Poles and the Ukrainians. This is attributed to the view within the Nazi hierarchy that a large swath of the populace was &quot;capable of Aryanization,&quot; hence, the Czechs were not subjected to a similar degree of random and organized acts of brutality that their Polish counterparts experienced. Such capacity for Aryanization was supported by the position that part of the Czech population had German ancestry. On the other hand, the Czechs/Slavs were not considered by the Germans as a racial equal due to its classification as a mixture of races with Jewish and Asiatic influences. This was illustrated in a series of discussion, which denigrated it as less valuable and, specifically, the Czechs as &quot;dangerous and must be handled differently from Aryan peoples.&quot;

A paradox of German policy was that the collaborators such as Hácha were held in contempt by the Nazis as &quot;riff raff&quot; while those who clung most defiantly to their sense of Czech identity were considered to be the better subjects of Germanizaton. Heydrich in a report to Berlin stated that Hácha was &quot;incapable of Germanization&quot; as &quot;he is always sick, arrives with a trembling voice and attempts to evoke pity that demands our mercy&quot;. By contrast, Heydrich had a grudging respect for Elias, noting that he was youthful, healthy, and a determined defender of Czech interests, which led Heydrich to conclude that he must have some German blood.

Aside from the inconsistency of animosity towards Slavs, there is also the fact that the forceful but restrained policy in Czechoslovakia was partly driven by the need to keep the population nourished and complacent so that it can carry out the vital work of arms production in the factories. By 1939, the country was already serving as a major hub of military production for Germany, manufacturing aircraft, tanks, artillery, and other armaments.

===Slovak National Uprising===

The Slovak National Uprising (&quot;1944 Uprising&quot;) was an armed struggle between German Wehrmacht forces and rebel Slovak troops August–October 1944. It was centered at Banská Bystrica.

The rebel Slovak Army, formed to fight the Germans, had an estimated 18,000 soldiers in August, a total which first increased to 47,000 after mobilisation on 9 September 1944, and later to 60,000, plus 20,000 partisans. However, in late August, German troops were able to disarm the Eastern Slovak Army, which was the best equipped, and thus significantly decreased the power of the Slovak Army. Many members of this force were sent to Nazi concentration camps; others escaped and joined partisan units.

The Slovaks were aided in the Uprising by soldiers and partisans from the Soviet Union, United Kingdom, US, France, the Czech Republic, and Poland. In total, 32 nations were involved in the Uprising.

===Czechoslovak government-in-exile===

Edvard Beneš resigned as president of the First Czechoslovak Republic on 5 October 1938 after the Nazi coup. In London, he and other Czechoslovak exiles organized a Czechoslovak government-in-exile and negotiated to obtain international recognition for the government and a renunciation of the Munich Agreement and its consequences. After World War II broke out, a Czechoslovak national committee was constituted in France, and under Beneš&#x27;s presidency sought international recognition as the exiled government of Czechoslovakia. This attempt led to some minor successes, such as the French-Czechoslovak treaty of 2 October 1939, which allowed for the reconstitution of the Czechoslovak army on French territory, yet full recognition was not reached. The Czechoslovak army in France was established on 24 January 1940, and units of its 1st Infantry Division took part in the last stages of the Battle of France, as did some Czechoslovak fighter pilots in various French fighter squadrons.

Beneš hoped for a restoration of the Czechoslovak state in its pre-Munich form after the anticipated Allied victory, a false hope. The government in exile—with Beneš as president of republic—was set up in June 1940 in exile in London, with the President living at Aston Abbotts. On 18 July 1940, it was recognised by the British government. Belatedly, the Soviet Union (in the summer of 1941) and the U.S. (in the winter) recognised the exiled government. In 1942, Allied repudiation of the Munich Agreement established the political and legal continuity of the First Republic and &quot;de jure&quot; recognition of Beneš&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; presidency. The success of Operation Anthropoid—which resulted in the British-backed assassination of one of Hitler&#x27;s top henchmen, Reichsprotektor of Bohemia and Moravia Reinhard Heydrich, by Jozef Gabčík and Jan Kubiš on 27 May—influenced the Allies in this repudiation.

The Munich Agreement had been precipitated by the subversive activities of the Sudeten Germans. During the latter years of the war, Beneš worked toward resolving the German minority problem and received consent from the Allies for a solution based on a postwar transfer of the Sudeten German population. The First Republic had been committed to a Western policy in foreign affairs. The Munich Agreement was the outcome. Beneš determined to strengthen Czechoslovak security against future German aggression through alliances with Poland and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union, however, objected to a tripartite Czechoslovak-Polish-Soviet commitment. In December 1943, Beneš&#x27;s government concluded a treaty just with the Soviets.

Beneš&#x27;s interest in maintaining friendly relations with the Soviet Union was motivated also by his desire to avoid Soviet encouragement of a post-war communist coup in Czechoslovakia. Beneš worked to bring Czechoslovak communist exiles in Britain into cooperation with his government, offering far-reaching concessions, including the nationalization of heavy industry and the creation of local people&#x27;s committees at the war&#x27;s end. In March 1945, he gave key cabinet positions to Czechoslovak communist exiles in Moscow.

Especially after the German reprisals for the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich, most of the Czech resistance groups demanded, with eerie irony and based on Nazi terror during the occupation, ethnic cleansing or the &quot;final solution of the German question&quot; () which would have to be &quot;solved&quot; by deportation of the ethnic Germans from their homeland. These reprisals included massacres in villages Lidice and Ležáky, although these villages were not connected with Czech resistance.

These demands were adopted by the government-in-exile, which sought the support of the Allies for this proposal, beginning in 1943. During the occupation of Czechoslovakia, the Government-in-Exile promulgated a series of laws that are now referred to as the &quot;Beneš decrees&quot;. One part of these decrees dealt with the status of ethnic Germans and Hungarians in postwar Czechoslovakia, and laid the ground for the deportation of some 3,000,000 Germans and Hungarians from the land that had been their home for centuries (see expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia, and Hungarians in Slovakia). The Beneš decrees declared that German property was to be confiscated without compensation. However, the final agreement authorizing the forced population transfer of the Germans was not reached until 2 August 1945 at the end of the Potsdam Conference.

==End of the war==

===Liberation of Czechoslovakia===
On 8 May 1944, Beneš signed an agreement with Soviet leaders stipulating that &quot;Czechoslovak territory liberated by Soviet armies&quot; would be placed under Czechoslovak civilian control.

On 21 September, Czechoslovak troops formed in the Soviet-liberated village, Kalinov, which was the first liberated settlement of Slovakia, located near the Dukla Pass in northeastern part of the country. Slovakia and the Czech lands were occupied mostly by Soviet troops (the Red Army), supported by Czech and Slovak resistance, from the east to the west; only southwestern Bohemia was liberated by other Allied troops from the west. Even at the end of the war, German troops massacred Czech civilians; the Massacre in Trhová Kamenice and the Massacre at Javoříčko are examples of this.

A provisional Czechoslovak government was established by the Soviets in the eastern Slovak city of Košice on 4 April 1945. &quot;National committees&quot; (supervised by the Red Army) took over the administration of towns as the Germans were expelled. Bratislava was taken by the Soviets on 4 April.

On 5 May 1945, in the last moments of the war in Europe, the Prague uprising (Czech: Pražské povstání) began. It was an attempt by the Czech resistance to liberate the city of Prague from German occupation during World War II. The uprising went on until 8 May 1945, ending in a ceasefire the day before the arrival of the Red Army and one day after Victory in Europe Day.

Prague was taken on 9 May by Soviet troops during the Prague Offensive which had begun on 6 May and ended by 11 May. When the Soviets arrived, Prague was already in a general state of confusion due to the Prague Uprising. Soviet and other Allied troops were withdrawn from Czechoslovakia in the same year.

It is estimated that about 345,000 World War II casualties were from Czechoslovakia, 277,000 of them Jews. As many as 144,000 Soviet troops died during the liberation of Czechoslovakia.

===Annexation of Subcarpathian Ruthenia by the Soviet Union===
In October 1944, Subcarpathian Ruthenia was taken by the Soviets. A Czechoslovak delegation under František Němec was dispatched to the area. The delegation was to mobilize the liberated local population to form a Czechoslovak army and to prepare for elections in cooperation with recently established national committees. Loyalty to a Czechoslovak state was tenuous in Carpathian Ruthenia. Beneš&#x27;s proclamation of April 1944 excluded former collaborationist Hungarians, Germans and the Rusynophile Ruthenian followers of Andrej Bródy and the Fencik Party (who had collaborated with the Hungarians) from political participation. This amounted to approximately ⅓ of the population. Another ⅓ was communist, leaving ⅓ of the population presumably sympathetic to the Czechoslovak Republic.

Upon arrival in Subcarpathian Ruthenia, the Czechoslovak delegation set up headquarters in Khust, and on 30 October issued a mobilization proclamation. Soviet military forces prevented both the printing and the posting of the Czechoslovak proclamation and proceeded instead to organize the local population. Protests from Beneš&#x27;s government were ignored. Soviet activities led much of the local population to believe that Soviet annexation was imminent. The Czechoslovak delegation was also prevented from establishing a cooperative relationship with the local national committees promoted by the Soviets. On 19 November, the communists—meeting in Mukachevo—issued a resolution requesting separation of Subcarpathian Ruthenia from Czechoslovakia and incorporation into the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. On 26 November, the Congress of National Committees unanimously accepted the resolution of the communists. The congress elected the National Council and instructed that a delegation be sent to Moscow to discuss union. The Czechoslovak delegation was asked to leave Subcarpathian Ruthenia. Negotiations between the Czechoslovak government and Moscow ensued. Both Czech and Slovak communists encouraged Beneš to cede Subcarpathian Ruthenia. The Soviet Union agreed to postpone annexation until the postwar period to avoid compromising Beneš&#x27;s policy based on the pre-Munich frontiers.

The treaty ceding Carpathian Ruthenia to the Soviet Union was signed in June 1945. Czechs and Slovaks living in Subcarpathian Ruthenia and Ruthenians (Rusyns) living in Czechoslovakia were given the choice of Czechoslovak or Soviet citizenship.

===Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia===
In May 1945, Czechoslovak troops took possession of the borderland. A Czechoslovak administrative commission composed exclusively of Czechs was established. Sudeten Germans were subjected to restrictive measures and conscripted for compulsory labor. On 15 June, however, Beneš called Czechoslovak authorities to order. In July, Czechoslovak representatives addressed the Potsdam Conference (the U.S., Britain and the Soviet Union) and presented plans for a &quot;humane and orderly transfer&quot; of the Sudeten German population. There were substantial exceptions from expulsions that applied to about 244,000 ethnic Germans who were allowed to remain in Czechoslovakia.

The following groups of ethnic Germans were not deported:
* anti-fascists
* persons crucial for industries
* those married to ethnic Czechs

It is estimated that between 700,000 and 800,000 Germans were affected by &quot;wild&quot; expulsions between May and August 1945. The expulsions were encouraged by Czechoslovak politicians and were generally carried out by the order of local authorities, mostly by groups of armed volunteers. However, in some cases it was initiated or pursued by assistance of the regular army.

The expulsion according to the Potsdam Conference proceeded from 25 January 1946 until October of that year. An estimated 1.6 million ethnic Germans were deported to the American zone of what would become West Germany. An estimated 800,000 were deported to the Soviet zone (in what would become East Germany). Several thousand died violently during the expulsion and many more died from hunger and illness as a consequence. These casualties include violent deaths and suicides, deaths in internment camps and natural causes. The joint Czech-German commission of historians stated in 1996 the following numbers: The deaths caused by violence and abnormal living conditions amount to approximately 10,000 persons killed. Another 5,000–6,000 people died of unspecified reasons related to expulsion making the total number of victims of the expulsion 15,000–16,000 (this excludes suicides, which make another approximately 3,400 cases).

Approximately 225,000 Germans remained in Czechoslovakia, of whom 50,000 emigrated or were expelled soon after.

<text>HMS &quot;Theseus&quot; &quot;/ˈtʰeː.seu̯s/, [ˈt̪ʰeːs̠ɛu̯s̠]&quot; (R64) was a light fleet aircraft carrier of the Royal Navy. &quot;Theseus&quot; was laid down on 6 January 1943 by Fairfield at Govan and was launched on 6 July 1944. She was involved in the Korean War and the Suez Crisis. The scrapping of the Theseus was commenced on 29 May 1962 at Inverkeithing, Scotland.

The ship&#x27;s name, Theseus, is derived from a hero in Greek mythology, specifically the legendary king and founder of Athens, who bears the same name.

==Service history==
===Work-up and initial service===

&quot;Theseus&quot; was laid down to serve in the Second World War, but was not completed until 9 February 1946, after peace was declared in 1945. &quot;Theseus&quot; was then utilized as a training vessel until the outbreak of the Korean War.

In 1946, &quot;Theseus&quot; embarked on work-up and embarked aircraft, conducted trials, and a further work-up for operational service. After preparation for duty in the Far East, she sailed to join the British Pacific Fleet at Singapore as Flagship for the Flag Officer Air, Far East. In 1947, she deployed as the Flagship of the 1st Aircraft Carrier Squadron of the British Pacific Fleet. Upon her return to the United Kingdom she was refitted for service in the Home Fleet. She then joined the 3rd Aircraft Carrier Squadron, Home Fleet.

===Korean War===
In 1950, with the beginning of the Korean War, the &quot;Theseus&quot; was deployed to Korea to commence standard carrier operations. Her first operation involved suppressing enemy defences and communications at Chinnampo, among other locations. Her second operational patrol involved only Combat Air Patrols (CAP) because her take-off weight capacity was limited by a dysfunctional catapult, and thus aircraft were unable to be armed with rockets and bombs. Her third operational duty was as part of the Commonwealth Task Force. &quot;Theseus&quot; sailed with accompanying ships from Sasebo in Japan. The carrier&#x27;s aircraft launched successful air strikes on bridges, North Korean troops, and other opportune targets. HMS Theseus&#x27; operations in the Korean War primarily concentrated on the Chinnampo area, resulting in widespread damage to the area.

During her fourth operational patrol, which began in December of 1950, aircraft from &quot;Theseus&quot; sighted and fired on numerous land vehicles in the north of the separated country. Many of the targeted vehicles were destroyed. Soon afterwards, Chinese troops became the target of attacks from the carrier&#x27;s aircraft, which had completed over 1,630 hours in the air and had fired over 1,400 rockets by the completion of their fourth tour.

On 5 January 1951, &quot;Theseus&quot; began her fifth operational patrol supporting the American 25th Division, who were fighting south of Osan in South Korea. On 15 January &quot;Theseus&quot; achieved the milestone of 1,000 accident-free landings. The Carrier Air Group (CAG) were awarded the Boyd Trophy for a remarkable operational tour of duty that included many firsts for pilots and aircrew.

&quot;Theseus&quot;&#x27; sixth operational patrol in late January of 1951, included several major and minor accidents. On 26 January, an aircraft appeared to shudder before spinning out of control and into the sea. The went to the location of the crash but to no avail. A second aircraft was hit a number of times by anti-aircraft gunfire, forcing the pilot to ditch the aircraft in a valley in an area near Tongduchon-ni. The pilot waited for rescue for about ninety minutes. An American helicopter flew in and picked up the pilot, while other aircraft from &quot;Theseus&quot; flew a close-air patrol over the area. On 2 February, a Sea Fury burst a tyre while landing, straining the fuselage and bringing the number of accident-free landings to an end at 1,463.

The seventh operational patrol started off poorly when a squadron of Fairey Fireflies returning from a reconnaissance mission experienced weapon misfires, causing one fatality. Further similar missions were flown, as well as close air support for the U.S. IX Corps in the Wonju area.

The eighth operational patrol, beginning on 4 March 1951, saw much of the same, with patrols over the now-familiar area of Chinnampo to Kuhsa-Sung to create the illusion of an imminent amphibious assault. Two more crashes occurred, the first incurring no casualties, but the second proving fatal when an aircraft crashed while returning to &quot;Theseus&quot;.

The ninth operational patrol opened with the shooting down of another aircraft at Suwon on 24 March. Further reconnaissance and CAS missions were flown, including an attack on six enemy vessels.

The tenth operational patrol began on 8 April 1951, operating in the Sea of Japan accompanied by the American carrier , together with an allied destroyer screen, comprising , , , and . On 10 April two Sea Furies were attacked by American Corsairs in a friendly-fire incident. One Sea Fury was seriously damaged, though the other escaped unscathed after much maneuvering. Two other Sea Furies performing reconnaissance duties nearby heard the call for assistance. However, while on the way there, one was shot down and the pilot was taken prisoner. Another aircraft searching for the first was shot down by flak, but the pilot escaped capture.

Two separate aircraft were shot down shortly afterward. The first landed only forty miles from &quot;Theseus&quot;, damaged by flak, and was soon rescued by helicopter. The second, also hit by flak, crashed into a paddy field and skidded into a dry river bed where it came under small arms fire from North Korean troops. The remaining aircraft from the flight acted as a RESCAP (Rescue Close Air Patrol) while a further two Sea Furies escorted a helicopter en route to the downed pilot&#x27;s location. After thirty-eight minutes, the severely injured pilot was rescued.

Further successful strikes were launched on numerous North Korean targets. During these strikes, another aircraft from the carrier&#x27;s flight complement was shot down. The downed pilot was rescued by an American helicopter pilot who was later awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for successfully carrying out a courageous rescue despite heavy small-arms fire from North Korean troops. He was awarded the honor at the British Consulate in Seattle.

On 15 January 1952 allied task force operations ended with the departure of the American carrier &quot;Bataan&quot;. &quot;Theseus&quot; continued operations in Korea, this time on the west coast. An aircraft from &quot;Theseus&quot; was ditched due to engine failure, the pilot spending 55 minutes in a rough sea before being rescued. Operations from &quot;Theseus&quot; ended two days later. &quot;Theseus&quot; was replaced by her sister ship and departed Korea from Sasebo.

Naval-history.net records state that in late 1951, &quot;Theseus&quot; joined the Home Fleet as Flagship, 2nd Aircraft Carrier Squadron. In 1952, she became Home Fleet Flagship, and was then detached to the Mediterranean to relieve &quot;Glory&quot; for service with the United Nations&#x27; effort off Korea. She took part in joint exercises in the Mediterranean with other Home Fleet ships. From February to March of 1952, &quot;Theseus&quot;, with the 14th Carrier Air Group embarked, took part in the NATO Exercise Grand Slam in the Mediterranean.

In 1953 she took part in the Fleet Review, celebrating the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.

===Suez Crisis and fate===

In 1956, &quot;Theseus&quot; was used as an emergency commando carrier, along with , during the Suez Crisis. From November to December, helicopters from &quot;Theseus&quot; transported troops ashore and evacuated wounded soldiers. Compared to her actions during the Korean War, her role at Suez was relatively minor. The following year she was placed in reserve. In 1962, she was broken up in Inverkeithing, Scotland.

<text>The Third Czechoslovak Republic (; ), officially the Czechoslovak Republic (; ), was a sovereign state from April 1945 to February 1948 following the end of World War II.

After the fall of Nazi Germany, the country was reformed and reassigned coterminous borders as its pre-war predecessor state, First Czechoslovak Republic; it likewise restored the predecessor&#x27;s international recognition. Due to the rise of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSČ), Czechoslovakia fell within the Soviet sphere of influence, and this circumstance dominated any plans or strategies for post-war reconstruction. Consequently, the political and economic organisation of Czechoslovakia became largely a matter of negotiations between Edvard Beneš and the Communist Party members exiled in Moscow.

In February 1948, the Communist Party seized full power in a coup d&#x27;état. Despite the country&#x27;s official name remaining the &quot;Czechoslovak Republic&quot; until 1960, when it was changed to the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, events of February 1948 are considered the end of the Third Republic.

== History ==

===1945===
The Third Republic came into being in April 1945 with the creation of the Košice Programme. All of the remaining German armed forces also surrendered to the Allies on 8 May 1945. President Beneš flew from his exile in London to Košice in eastern Slovakia, which had been taken by the Red Army and which became the temporary capital. In Košice the new National Front government was formed, based on discussions dating back to 1943, with Beneš remaining president, Zdeněk Fierlinger becoming prime minister with Klement Gottwald as deputy premier.

In the National Front coalition three socialist parties—KSČ, Czechoslovak Social Democratic Party, and Czechoslovak National Social Party—predominated. The Slovak Popular Party was banned as collaborationist with the Nazis. Other conservative yet democratic parties, such as the Republican Party of Farmers and Peasants (RSZML), were prevented from resuming activities in the postwar period. Certain acceptable nonsocialist parties were included in the coalition; among them were the Catholic People&#x27;s Party (in Moravia) and the Slovak Democratic Party. 

The government moved back to Prague after its liberation on 10 May. Beneš was pressured by the Soviet Union to grant them the Carpathian Ruthenia territory as a sort of war reparation, and a treaty was signed on 29 June 1945 annexing it to the Ukrainian SSR of the Soviet Union.

Industries, employing 61.2 percent of the industrial labour force, were nationalised.

14 October 1945 saw a new provisional national assembly voted in.

Beneš had compromised with the KSČ to avoid a postwar coup; he naïvely hoped that the democratic process would restore a more equitable distribution of power. Beneš had negotiated the Soviet alliance, but at the same time he hoped to establish Czechoslovakia as a &quot;bridge&quot; between East and West, capable of maintaining contacts with both sides. The KSČ leader Klement Gottwald, however, professed commitment to a &quot;gradualist&quot; approach, that is, to a KSČ assumption of power by democratic means.

The popular enthusiasm evoked by the Soviet armies of liberation benefited the KSČ. Czechs, bitterly disappointed by the West at the Munich Agreement, responded favourably to both the KSČ and the Soviet alliance. Communists secured strong representation in the popularly elected national committees, the new organs of local administration. The KSČ organised and centralised the trades union movement; of 120 representatives to the Central Council of Trades Unions, 94 were communists. The party worked to acquire a mass membership, including peasants and the petite bourgeoisie, as well as the proletariat. Between May 1945 and May 1946, KSČ membership grew from 27,000 to over 1.1 million.

===1946===
In the May 1946 election, the KSČ won in the Czech part of the country (40.17%), while the anti-Communist Democratic Party won in Slovakia (62%). In sum, however, the KSČ won a plurality of 38 percent of the vote at the Czechoslovak level. Beneš continued as president of the republic, and Jan Masaryk, son of the revered founding father, continued as foreign minister. Gottwald became prime minister. Most important, although the communists held only a minority of portfolios, they were able to gain control over such key ministries as information, internal trade, finance and interior (including the police apparatus). Through these ministries, the communists were able to suppress noncommunist opposition, place party members in positions of power, and create a solid basis for a takeover attempt.

===1947===
The year that followed was uneventful. The KSČ continued to proclaim its &quot;national&quot; and &quot;democratic&quot; orientation. The turning point came in the summer of 1947. In July, the Czechoslovak government, with KSČ approval, accepted an Anglo-French invitation to attend preliminary discussions of the Marshall Plan. The Soviet Union responded immediately to the Czechoslovak move to continue the Western alliance: Stalin summoned Gottwald to Moscow.

Upon his return to Prague, the KSČ reversed its decision. In subsequent months, the party demonstrated a significant radicalisation of its tactics. The KSČ argued that a reactionary coup was imminent, and that immediate action was necessary to prevent it. Through media and police means, they intensified their activity. Originally announced by Gottwald at the KSČ Central Committee meeting in November 1947, news of the &quot;reactionary plot&quot; was disseminated throughout the country by the communist press.

From June of that year, and especially after the outbreak of the 1947–1948 civil war in Mandatory Palestine in November, Czechoslovakia began to sell arms to the Palestinian Jewish Haganah defense force. It was the only foreign state to do so. This policy, continued after the declaration of the State of Israel the following year, would play an important role in the victory of the Jewish state in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.

===1948===

In January 1948, the communist-controlled Ministry of Interior proceeded to purge the Czechoslovak security forces, substituting noncommunists with communists. Simultaneously, the KSČ began agitating for increased nationalisation and for a new land reform limiting landholdings to fifty hectares.

A cabinet crisis precipitated the February coup. Backed by all non-communist parties, the National Social ministers said that the communists were using the Ministry of Interior&#x27;s police and security forces to suppress non-communists, and demanded a halt to this. Prime Minister Gottwald, however, repeatedly forestalled discussion of the police issue. On 21 February, National Socialists resigned from the cabinet in protest. The Catholic People&#x27;s Party and the Slovak Democratic Party followed suit.

The twelve noncommunist ministers resigned, in part, to induce Beneš to call for early elections. Communist losses were anticipated owing to popular disapproval of recent KSČ tactics. A January poll indicated a 10-percent decline in Communist electoral support. Yet the Czechoslovak National Socialists made their move without adequate coordination with Beneš. The democratic parties, in addition, made no effort to rally popular support.

The non-Communists believed that Beneš would refuse to accept their resignations and keep them in a caretaker government, which would presumably force Gottwald to either back down or resign. Beneš initially refused to accept the resignations and declared that no government could be formed without non-Communist ministers. However, in the days that followed, he shunned the non-Communist ministers to avoid accusation of collusion. The Czechoslovak Army remained neutral.

In the meantime, the KSČ garnered its forces. The communist-controlled Ministry of Interior deployed police regiments to sensitive areas and equipped a workers&#x27; militia. The communist-controlled Ministry of Information refused broadcasting time to noncommunist officials. Ministries held by noncommunist parties were secured by communist &quot;action committees.&quot; The action committees also purged all governmental and political party organs of unreliable elements. Gottwald threatened to call a general strike unless Beneš appointed a new, Communist-dominated government.

On 26 February, Beneš, perhaps fearing civil war and/or Soviet intervention, capitulated. He accepted the resignations of the dissident ministers and appointed a new cabinet from a list submitted by Gottwald. The new cabinet was dominated by Communists and pro-Soviet Social Democrats. Members of the People&#x27;s, National Socialist and Czech Democratic parties were also included, so the government was still nominally a coalition. However, the ministers using those labels were fellow travellers working hand in glove with the Communists. This act marked the onset of out-and-out Communist rule in Czechoslovakia.

<text>Eric Jack Pickles, Baron Pickles, (born 20 April 1952) is a British Conservative Party politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Brentwood and Ongar from 1992 to 2017. He served in David Cameron&#x27;s Cabinet as Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government from 2010 to 2015. He previously served as Chairman of the Conservative Party from 2009 to 2010 and was later the United Kingdom Anti-Corruption Champion from 2015 to 2017.

Pickles was appointed the UK Special Envoy for Post-Holocaust issues in 2015. He stood down as an MP at the 2017 general election, but continued in his role as Special Envoy under Prime Ministers Theresa May, Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak. He is the chairman of Conservative Friends of Israel in the House of Lords as of 2023.

==Early life==
Eric Jack Pickles was born on 20 April 1952, the son of Jack and Constance Pickles. Born in Keighley, West Riding of Yorkshire, he attended Greenhead Grammar School (now Carlton Keighley) and then studied at Leeds Polytechnic. He was born into a Labour-supporting family – his great-grandfather was one of the founders of the Independent Labour Party, and Pickles described himself as &quot;massively inclined&quot; towards communism as a boy.

==Young Conservatives==
After the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia, he joined the local Keighley Branch of the Young Conservatives in 1968, later commenting &quot;I joined because of the invasion of Czechoslovakia. I was so shocked by the tanks. It was not the best way of fighting Brezhnev, but it made me feel better&quot;.

Pickles soon became the chairman of the local Young Conservatives association. During his time in the Young Conservatives he became a member of the Joint Committee Against Racism from 1982 to 1987 and later became its chairman.
His period as national Young Conservative chairman saw growing factionalism with challenges from a southern-based right wing to Pickles&#x27; moderate leadership. Pickles also moved against right-wingers in Bradford, expelling the Young Conservative, Yorkshire Chairman of the Monday Club who had stood for the Bradford Wyke Ward on an anti-immigrant platform from the Bradford area constituencies.

==Bradford councillor==
Pickles was first elected to Bradford Council in 1979, representing the Worth Valley ward. From 1982 to 1984, he chaired that Council&#x27;s Social Services Committee, and then, from 1984 to 1986, he chaired the Education Committee. Between 1988 and 1990, he served as leader of the Conservative group on the council. In September 1988 the Conservative Party gained control by using the Conservative mayor&#x27;s casting vote to become the only inner-city council to be controlled by the Conservatives.

When Bradford Council was hung, Pickles opted to break the agreement that the position of Lord Mayor is rotated between the parties, when he put a Conservative mayor in place again. This effectively gave the Conservatives a majority due to the Lord Mayor&#x27;s casting vote. To do this, they also broke the tradition that the Lord Mayor kept the status quo.

Whilst at Bradford, Pickles announced a five-year plan to cut the council&#x27;s budget by £50m, reduce the workforce by a third, privatise services and undertake council departmental restructures, many of which proved controversial. A book, &quot;The Pickles Papers&quot;, by Tony Grogan, was written about this period in Pickles&#x27; life.

==Parliamentary career==
Pickles was elected as Member of Parliament for Brentwood and Ongar in 1992.

At the 2001 general election, the independent politician Martin Bell, who had been the MP for Tatton, having run a campaign of &quot;anti-sleaze&quot;, stood against Pickles, due to accusations that the Peniel Pentecostal Church had infiltrated the local Conservative branch. Pickles&#x27;s vote was reduced from 45.4% to 38%, but he retained his seat by a margin of 2,821 votes (6.5%) becoming elected with 38% of the votes against Bell&#x27;s 31.5%.

Pickles served as Shadow Minister for Transport and Shadow Minister for London from September 2001 to June 2002, then as Shadow Minister for Local Government from June 2002.

At the 2005 general election Pickles held his seat with 53.5% of the votes and an increased majority of 11,612 (26.3%), nearly as many as the number of votes for the second-placed candidate, making this the second-safest Conservative seat in Eastern England, with Pickles taking the third-highest share of the vote cast in the region.

On 2 July 2007, David Cameron appointed Pickles to a reshuffled Shadow Cabinet as shadow Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. On 30 December 2008, according to reports in &quot;The Times&quot;, Pickles unveiled plans to &quot;purge town hall &#x27;fat cats&#x27;&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; reported that under the plans &quot;dozens of council chiefs who earn more than Cabinet ministers would lose their jobs as clusters of councils merged their frontline services and backroom operations to provide better value for money.&quot; Of the eight highest-earning chief executives listed in &quot;The Times&quot;&#x27; report, six were employed by councils run by the Conservative party, one by Labour and one by the Liberal Democrats.

Pickles was the campaign manager for the successful Crewe and Nantwich by-election in May 2008. Following this, he was promoted to Chairman of the Conservative Party, a post he held from January 2009 to May 2010.

In early 2010, Prime Minister Gordon Brown outlined plans to reform the voting system in the United Kingdom. Pickles defended the first-past-the-post system as resulting in stable government and attacked Brown, claiming he &quot;now wants to fiddle the electoral system&quot; by wanting to change the voting system.

Pickles was the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government in the coalition government headed by Prime Minister David Cameron from 12 May 2010 to May 2015.

Although a former Eurosceptic, in January 2016 Pickles became a founding member of the group Conservatives For Reform In Europe, a campaign to remain in the European Union on the basis that the EU would be reformed by the negotiations then being led by Prime Minister David Cameron.

In April 2017, Pickles announced he would not stand at the general election the following month. Later that year, he was appointed chairman of the journal &quot;Parliamentary Review&quot;.

Speaking live to GB News on 4 October 2022, Pickles stated that he had attended his 52nd consecutive Conservative Party Annual Conference that year.

==Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government==
Pickles was appointed as Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government as part of David Cameron&#x27;s new coalition Government on 12 May 2010, and sworn as a Privy Counsellor on 13 May 2010.

In his role as Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, on 30 July 2010, Pickles announced plans to hand powers where ministers can cap what they deem to be unreasonable increases in council taxes to local people. A consultation began in August 2010 and the powers, which will require legislation, should be in force by March 2012. Pickles said he was determined to reverse the presumption that Whitehall knows best by making local councils directly accountable to the local taxpayer. He said: &quot;If councils want to increase council tax further, they will have to prove the case to the electorate. Let the people decide&quot;. Residents would be asked to choose between accepting the rise or rejecting it and instead accepting a below inflation rise, but with reduced council services. The average council tax on a Band D property increased from £688 a year in 1997/98 to £1,439 for 2010.

In August 2010 Pickles unexpectedly announced the closure of the Audit Commission for England and Wales. The commission had overseen the appointment of independent external auditors for local authorities, and supported audit work to ensure value for money and the certification of Councils&#x27; financial accounts. Closure took until March 2015. Commentators questioned whether Whitehall would struggle to check whether council services and finances were about to fall over, particularly when money was channelled through public / private companies. In the aftermath of a series of major financial crises at local authorities such as Woking Borough Council and Thurrock, identified from 2021, senior figures in local government finance identified the critical need to reinstate functions formerly discharged by the Audit Commission and for a strong system leader to oversee councils and local audit.

Pickles is a figure who does not shun controversy. In &quot;The Observer&quot;, Will Hutton appraised his role with regard to local government as follows: &quot;Local government minister Eric Pickles has colluded cheerfully with George Osborne to knock local government back to being no more than rat catchers and managers of street lighting. Indeed, they scarcely give them the funds to carry out these activities&quot;.

In December 2014, asked in Parliament if people who left their wheelie bins in the street after a collection should be punished, he said they should be flogged -though he also said flogging was too good for them and that leaving the bin in the middle of the road was poor behaviour.

The Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal was unearthed during Pickles&#x27; tenure, and in February 2015 he announced a strategy to implement commissioners at Rotherham Council in the wake of the Casey Report, which had been commissioned in 2014 to investigate child sex abuse in Rotherham. Seven councillors resigned as a result of the damning report, which revealed that the local authority was &quot;wholly dysfunctional&quot; and that the failure to protect 1,400 girls from sexual abuse was a result of &quot;complacency, institutionalised political correctness&quot; and &quot;blatant failures of political and officer leadership&quot;.

===Localism Act===

Pickles was responsible for the Localism Act 2011 that changed the powers of local government in England. The measures affected by the Act include more elected mayors and referendums. The Localism Act opens with Part 1, Chapter 1(1), under the heading &quot;Local authority&#x27;s general power of competence&quot;, &quot;A local council has power to do anything that individuals generally may do&quot;.

The bill was introduced by Pickles, and given its first reading on 13 December 2010. The Bill completed the third reading in the House of Lords on 31 October 2011. The bill received royal assent on 15 November 2011.

The bill was quickly undermined, however, after it was published on 13 December. One of the claims made for it is that it would &quot;give local communities real control over housing and planning decisions&quot;, but on the same day, Pickles issued a decision in a planning appeal. The National Grid had applied to Tewkesbury Borough Council to build a gas plant just outside Tirley in Gloucestershire. The installation would occupy more than 16 acres and the application had been opposed by more than 1,000 residents in a sparsely populated rural area, by 12 parish councils and by every member of the planning committee of the local planning authority. Rejecting the local opposition, Pickles chose to grant permission to build the gas plant.

In April 2014, South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon welcomed the decision that Pickles and the DCLG would have final say over the building of wind turbines. By June 2014, Pickles had intervened on 12 windfarm projects and rejected 10 of them, against the recommendations from planning inspectors, rising to 50 rejections by October 2014.

===Council prayers===
On 10 February 2012, the National Secular Society obtained a High Court judicial review of Christian prayers held as part of formal local council meetings, which councillors disagreeing with the practice had to attend if not wishing to walk out discourteously.
Mr Justice Ouseley ruled: &quot;The saying of prayers as part of the formal meeting of a Council is not lawful under s. 111 of the Local Government Act 1972, and there is no statutory power permitting the practice to continue. I do not think the 1972 Act should be interpreted as permitting the religious views of one group of councillors, however sincere or large in number, to exclude, or even to a modest extent, to impose burdens on or even to mark out those who do not share their views and do not wish to participate in their expression of them. They are all equally elected councillors&quot;. Prayers were permitted to be held before the start of the formal agenda.

Eric Pickles vowed to reverse the High Court decision, despite a YouGov poll which found that 55% of people were against councils holding prayers, and 26% in favour. Eric Pickles brought forward his Localism Act, due to become law in April 2012, and made it law on 17 February 2012, saying that he was &#x27;effectively reversing&#x27; the High Court decision.

Keith Porteous Wood, executive director of the National Secular Society, commented &quot;A number of senior lawyers have expressed doubt whether the Localism Act will, as Mr Pickles hopes, make prayers lawful, and the Act was clearly not passed with that express intention. His powers to pass legislation are not, as he implies, untrammelled. Council prayers increasingly look set to become a battle between the Government and the courts at ever higher levels&quot;. The Localism Act states that &quot;a local authority has power to do anything that individuals generally may do&quot;. Eric Pickles wrote to faith leaders, local authority leaders, and the Society of Local Council Clerks, and telling parish councils &quot;Once the power is in place, eligible parish councils will be able to include prayers as part of their formal business&quot;. In April 2013, referring to the issue of prayers in council meetings, Pickles said in a speech at the Conservative Spring Forum that &quot;militant atheists&quot; should accept that Britain is a Christian country. In 2015 the Local Government (Religious Observances) Act, which was welcomed by Pickles, authorised councils to hold prayers at the start of sessions.

===Troubled Families===
Pickles led the Troubled Families Programme designed to turn around 120,000 dysfunctional families responsible, at a cost of around £400 million. According to David Cameron, these families were responsible for &#x27;a large proportion of the problems in society&#x27;. The families were selected for having 5 of 7 measures of social and economic deprivation. Pickles claimed repeatedly that these families cost the state £9 billion per annum. In March 2015 Pickles declared the programme a &#x27;triumph&#x27; in the House of Commons after it allegedly &#x27;turned around&#x27; 105,600 families of 117,910 processed and saved £1.2 billion per annum. £1.2 billion per annum was a hypothetical number based on assumptions that alleged improvements in behaviour would be sustained and depended on removing the high costs associated with disabled children and chronically sick, unemployed adults.

The Evaluation by the National Institute for Economic and Social Research was published on 17 October 2016. The report found that there had been &quot;no significant impact&quot; of the scheme. A press release from NIESR stated, &quot;we were unable to find consistent evidence that the programme had any significant or systematic impact&quot;. The Times reported the following day, &quot;the report was published quietly last night after complaints from Whitehall insiders that it was being suppressed&quot;.

The Public Accounts Committee published its report on 19 December 2016. They concluded that the delay in publication had been unacceptable, that DCLG had failed to demonstrate that the programme had any significant impact and that the terminology of saying that the families had been &quot;turned around&quot; was misleading given that many of the families had continuing problems after a result had been claimed. The PAC chairwoman, Meg Hillier, commented that the report was &quot;far more serious&quot; than &quot;a slap on the wrist&quot; for ministers.

===Flooding of the Somerset Levels===

From December 2013 onwards the Somerset Levels suffered severe flooding as part of the wider 2013-2014 Atlantic winter storms in Europe and subsequent 2013–2014 United Kingdom winter floods.

There were public calls for the rivers Parrett and Tone, in particular, to be dredged. The Environment Agency was blamed for not having dredged the major river channels of the Levels. The Environment Agency and others pointed out that it would be more effective to spend money on delaying floodwaters upstream, and that increasing the capacity of rivers by dredging would be of no significant use; the Environment Secretary defended the Agency. Roger Falconer, Professor of Water Management at Cardiff University, and other hydrologists made clear that dredging did not offer a useful solution to flooding on the Somerset Levels.

On 7 February, the Environment Secretary needed an urgent operation and handed over the flood management to Eric Pickles. Pickles then appeared on &quot;The Andrew Marr Show&quot; and apologised &quot;unreservedly&quot; for not dredging the Somerset Levels and said that &quot;the government may have relied too much on the advice&quot; of the Environment Agency. The head of the Environment Agency Lord Chris Smith rejected the criticism of his organisation. The Environment Secretary protested in the strongest possible terms to the Prime Minister about Pickles&#x27; &quot;grandstanding&quot;.

==Controversies==
===Second home===
On 26 March 2009, Pickles appeared on the political debate programme &quot;Question Time&quot; in Newcastle. While discussing the controversy over Tony McNulty (who had recently admitted claiming expenses on a second home, occupied by his parents, only 8 miles away from his primary residence), Pickles admitted he claimed a second home allowance because he lived 37 miles from Westminster and needed to leave his constituency house in Brentwood at 5.30 am to get to Westminster for 9.30 am, given that he tended to get home at midnight or 1 am, although the standard time for commuters from this region is usually ninety minutes. He went on to say that it was &quot;no fun&quot; commuting into London from where he lived. In response to Pickles&#x27;s comments that he &quot;had to be there [the House of Commons] on time&quot;, &quot;Question Time&quot; host David Dimbleby, replied &quot;Like a job, in other words?&quot; and fellow panellist Caroline Lucas added &#x27;welcome to the real world&#x27;, both of which prompted amusement and applause amongst the audience.

Pickles was asked to pay back £300 following the MP&#x27;s expenses scandal, which he had claimed for cleaning.

=== Grenfell Tower Inquiry controversy ===
The Grenfell Tower fire, which killed 72 people and destroyed Grenfell Tower in North Kensington, London, happened on 14 June 2017 when Pickles was no longer the minister responsible for housing, but the tower&#x27;s renovation using flammable cladding was designed and agreed while he was housing minister.

On 7 April 2022, Pickles was giving evidence to the Grenfell Tower Inquiry based on his experience as Secretary of State for Housing from 2010 to 2015. He went on to challenge the inquiry not to waste his time while giving evidence, before getting the death toll from the disaster wrong. He later apologised, claiming he &quot;misspoke&quot;.

The Grenfell Tower Inquiry final report, published on 4 September 2024, was critical of Pickles and his government department for failing to act on a 2013 coroner recommendation to improve cladding fire safety regulations and for his enthusiastic support of a programme to slash regulations which dominated department thinking. This led to calls for him to resign from the House of Lords and as a government ethics adviser.

==Personal life==
Pickles married Irene Coates in 1976 in Staincliffe, a district of Batley in West Yorkshire.

==Honours==
* Eric Pickles was sworn in as a member of Her Majesty&#x27;s Most Honourable Privy Council in 2010. This gave him the Honorific Prefix &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; and after Ennoblement the Post Nominal Letters &quot;PC&quot; for Life.
* On 22 May 2015 it was announced that Pickles was to be appointed a Knight Bachelor.
* He was nominated for a Life Peerage by Theresa May on 18 May 2018. On 18 June 2018 he was created Baron Pickles, of Brentwood and Ongar in the County of Essex. He sits on the Conservative Party benches in the House of Lords.

<doc id="421735" wikidata="Q334072" url="?curid=421735" title="Chaudhry Sarwar">
<text>Chaudhry Mohammad Sarwar () is a Pakistani and former British politician who served as the 31st and 33rd Governor of Punjab, from 2013 to 2015 and from 2018 to 2022. In his first term, he represented the Pakistan Muslim League (N). In his second term, he represented the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf. He was a member of the Senate of Pakistan from March 2018 until September 2018. From 1997 to 2010 Sarwar was a Member of Parliament in the United Kingdom, representing a constituency in Glasgow, Scotland. He is the father of Anas Sarwar, the current leader of the Scottish Labour Party. 

Born in Pirmahal, Punjab, Sarwar moved to Scotland in 1976 and built up a chain of cash and carry stores. Sarwar served as the Scottish Labour Member of Parliament for Glasgow Central from 1997 to 2010 and retired from UK politics in 2010. During his tenure at Westminster, Sarwar served on the Scottish Affairs Select Committee, and his youngest son Anas Sarwar, who currently leads the Scottish Labour Party, served as MP for the same constituency from 2010 to 2015. He was the country&#x27;s first Muslim Member of Parliament.

He relinquished UK citizenship in July 2013 and became Governor of Punjab, representing the Pakistan Muslim League (N). He resigned from the position on 29 January 2015 after disagreeing with the government&#x27;s foreign policy. He joined the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on 10 February 2015.

He was a member of the Senate of Pakistan from March to September 2018. He was appointed to a second term as Governor of Punjab in September 2018.

==Early and family life==
Mohammad Sarwar was born on 1 January 1950 to a Punjabi Arain family in Sain De Khuie, a village near Lyallpur (now Faisalabad), Pakistan. His family migrated from Jalandhar in 1947. In 1976 Sarwar moved to Scotland. That year he married Perveen Sarwar, with whom he has three sons and one daughter.

In 1982 Sarwar and his brother founded United Wholesale Grocers, a wholesale cash and carry business. In 2002 the brothers split the business, with Sarwar renaming his part as United Wholesale (Scotland) while his brother retained the previous name.

His eldest son was accused of an £850,000 missing trader fraud in United Wholesale (Scotland) while he was managing director in 2003. In 2011 the Court of Criminal Appeal overturned his 2007 conviction in the case. Mohammad Sarwar was a remunerated director of the company.

==British political career ==
Sarwar first stood as a Labour councillor for Pollokshields East at the 1987 Glasgow City Council election, almost overturning a large Conservative majority. In the 1992 election he won the ward. 
Sarwar was elected as MP for Glasgow Govan at the 1997 general election, becoming the first Muslim MP in the United Kingdom and the first Asian MP elected to represent a Scottish constituency. He was the first MP to swear the Oath of Allegiance on the Qur&#x27;an, using the method laid out by the Oaths Act 1978. Sarwar was suspended from holding office within the Labour Party in 1997 when he was charged with electoral offences, but he was acquitted in 1999 and the suspension was lifted.

He was re-elected in Glasgow Govan at the 2001 general election. The 2005 general election saw boundary changes in Scotland, so he stood at and won the new constituency of Glasgow Central. He faced an opponent from the far-right British National Party, with whom he refused to share a platform, and he persuaded other candidates to do the same. The returning officer announced the result from a platform with no candidates, and Sarwar later made a speech from the floor of the hall.

Sarwar became a member of the Scottish Affairs Select Committee from 2004, and was chairman since 2005. In August 2006, he was a signatory to an open letter to then-Prime Minister Tony Blair criticising UK foreign policy.

Sarwar played a crucial role in bringing to justice the killers of fifteen-year-old Glasgow schoolboy, Kriss Donald. The killers fled to Pakistan, which has no extradition treaty with the UK. Through his political connections, Sarwar was able to agree a one-off, no conditions attached, extradition treaty. They then faced trial and were convicted for the murder.

On 21 June 2007, Sarwar announced he would not stand for re-election at the 2010 general election. His son, Anas Sarwar, succeeded him as Labour MP for the Glasgow Central seat until the election of 2015 when it was taken by Alison Thewliss for the SNP.

In November 2008, Sarwar was one of 18 MPs who signed a Commons motion backing a Team GB football team at the 2012 Olympic Games, saying football &quot;should not be any different from other competing sports and our young talent should be allowed to show their skills on the world stage&quot;.

His nomination by outgoing Prime Minister, Gordon Brown for a life peerage in the 2010 Dissolution Honours was blocked by the House of Lords Appointments Commission on the advice of HM Revenue and Customs. 

In May 2021, shortly before the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, Scottish Pakistani voters received campaign messages on WhatsApp, allegedly from Sarwar, urging them to vote for Scottish Labour, led by his son, Anas Sarwar.

== Pakistani political career ==
Sarwar established the Sarwar Foundation in 2000, which focuses on provision of healthcare, clean water, education and women empowerment in Pakistan.

He campaigned and fundraised in Britain for the centre-right conservative party Pakistan Muslim League (N) during the 2013 general election in Pakistan. Soon after Pakistan Muslim League (N) chief Nawaz Sharif was sworn in as prime minister, he showed his intentions to become governor of Pakistan&#x27;s most populous province Punjab.

On 5 August 2013, he was sworn in as the 31st Governor of Punjab. 

He resigned as governor of Punjab on 29 January 2015. On 8 February 2015, Sarwar joined Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI). On 3 March 2018, Sarwar was elected to the Senate of Pakistan on a general seat from Punjab after receiving 44 first priority and two second priority votes in the senate elections of that year.

On 5 September 2018 Sarwar took oath as 33rd Governor of Punjab in the PTI Punjab administration. 

On 3 April 2022, amidst a constitutional crisis in Punjab, Sarwar was removed from the position of Governor of Punjab by the federal government and was replaced with Omar Sarfraz Cheema. His removal followed complaints from Parvez Elahi that he was not cooperative with PTI&#x27;s allies. 

Afterward, he criticized the PTI leadership and left the party. He then joined the Pakistan Muslim League (Q), and in January 2024, he joined the Pakistan People&#x27;s Party (PPP).

==Personal life==
Sarwar is a supporter of Glasgow football team Rangers.

<doc id="421737" wikidata="Q5456988" url="?curid=421737" title="Flags of the United States Armed Forces">
<text>The several branches of the United States Armed Forces are represented by flags. Within the U.S. military, various flags fly on various occasions, and on various ships, bases, camps, and military academies.

In general, the order of precedence (from viewer&#x27;s left to right) when displaying flags together in a military context is to display the U.S. national flag (also known as the &quot;colors&quot; or &quot;national colors&quot;), followed by the flags of the U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Space Force, and U.S. Coast Guard. If the U.S. Coast Guard is transferred to the Department of the Navy, the U.S. Coast Guard flag would precede the U.S. Air Force flag.

==Service flags==
==Maritime flags==
Many maritime flags have been used in the United States.

All maritime vessels and naval warships belonging to the United States (with a few exceptions such as U.S. Coast Guard vessels) fly the ensign of the United States, which is identical to the national flag of the United States (though originally was a design similar to the Grand Union Flag). All documented U.S. vessels, and all U.S. vessels in international or foreign waters, are required to display this ensign between 08:00 and sunset. Conversely, vessels of the U.S. Coast Guard display a unique ensign as a demonstration of its authority to stop, board, search, and conduct arrests and seizures aboard vessels subject to United States jurisdiction. Historically, the ensign displayed has changed as the flag of the United States has changed. Similarly, vessels of the Continental Navy flew many varied ensigns due to a vague standard set by the Continental Congress, the arrangement of stars and pattern of stripes being left to the commander&#x27;s interpretations.

Vessels of the U.S. Navy, Coast Guard, Military Sealift Command, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration display the jack of the United States from the jackstaff. Originally the First Navy Jack was displayed, a design containing the thirteen red and white stripes; while some maintain that it was superimposed by an uncoiled rattlesnake and the motto &quot;Dont tread on me&quot; , reminiscent of the Gadsden flag. It was later changed to a blue canton with white stars, the &quot;Union Jack&quot;, and updated as each state entered the Union. However, all warships were directed to fly the First Navy Jack, including the disputed rattlesnake and motto, since the duration of the War on Terror in 2002. On February 21, 2019, the Chief of Naval Operations directed that U.S. Navy warships fly the U.S. jack again beginning on June 4, 2019.

A Commissioning or Masthead pennant is flown from the masthead and represents the commission of the captain of the ship (and thus of the ship itself). Additionally, a Church pennant may be flown during religious services. This pennant, white with a blue cross (or blue tablets and Star of David for Jewish services), is the only flag authorized to be flown above the national ensign, and only when at sea. In addition, hospital ships display the Red Cross.

Ships and units ashore may also fly burgees displaying unit citations. Flags can also be used for signaling.

==Personal flags==
Officers with certain offices or billets, as well as all generals and admirals, have a personal flag assigned to represent their authority and/or command, thus they are often referred to as &quot;flag officers&quot;. Ashore, the flags are usually displayed within the owner&#x27;s office or raised on a secondary flagstaff near the unit colors, while if the officer embarked they are flown aboard ship according to rank. The appearance consists of a number of stars equal to the officer&#x27;s rank insignia, the colors determined by service: red with white stars for the Army and Marine Corps, blue with white stars for Naval commanders and Air Force. Certain staff and non-line officers have unique colors: white with blue stars for non-command Navy admirals, while Army chaplains and medical generals use ecclesiastical purple and maroon backgrounds, respectively.

Unique flags are given to the President (due to his position as Commander-in-Chief), Vice President, Secretary of Defense, Deputy Secretary of Defense, Under Secretaries of Defense, and Assistant Secretaries of Defense, each of the Secretaries of the Military Departments (Secretary of the Army, Secretary of the Navy, Secretary of the Air Force), Under Secretaries of the Military Departments (Under Secretary of the Army, Under Secretary of the Navy, Under Secretary of the Air Force), and Assistant Secretaries of the Military Departments (Assistant Secretary of the Army, Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force), the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Senior Enlisted Advisor of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the chief of the Military Services (Chief of Staff of the Army, Commandant of the Marine Corps, Chief of Naval Operations, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Chief of Space Operations, and Commandant of the Coast Guard). An admiral, acting commodore, or Convoy Commodore aboard a ship each may fly a flag from their flagship.

In addition, the Navy will display the flag of the Secretary of State when the secretary is embarked as the representative of the United States. Other diplomatic personnel are also afforded a consular flag when embarked. The Coast Guard, being part of the Department of Homeland Security, will utilize the Secretary&#x27;s flag much like the Navy will utilize the SecDef&#x27;s.






==Others==

<text>From the Communist coup d&#x27;état in February 1948 to the Velvet Revolution in 1989, Czechoslovakia was ruled by the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (, &quot;KSČ&quot;). The country belonged to the Eastern Bloc and was a member of the Warsaw Pact and of Comecon. During the era of Communist Party rule, thousands of Czechoslovaks faced political persecution for various offences, such as trying to emigrate across the Iron Curtain.

The 1993 Act on Lawlessness of the Communist Regime and on Resistance Against It determined that the communist government was illegal and that the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia was a criminal organisation.

==Stalinization==

On 25 February 1948, President Edvard Beneš gave in to the demands of Communist Prime Minister Klement Gottwald and appointed a Cabinet dominated by Communists. While it was nominally still a coalition, the &quot;non-Communists&quot; in the cabinet were mostly fellow travelers. This gave legal sanction to the KSČ coup, and marked the onset of undisguised Communist rule in Czechoslovakia. On 9 May, the National Assembly, purged of dissidents, passed a new constitution. It was not a completely Communist document; since a special committee prepared it in the 1945–48 period, it contained many liberal and democratic provisions. It reflected, however, the reality of Communist power through an addition that declared Czechoslovakia a people&#x27;s republic – a preliminary step towards socialism and, ultimately, communism – ruled by the dictatorship of the proletariat, and also gave the Communist Party the leading role in the state. For these reasons, Beneš refused to sign the so-called Ninth-of-May Constitution. Nevertheless, elections were held on 30 May, and voters were presented with a single list from the National Front, the former governing coalition which was now a broad patriotic organisation under Communist control. Beneš resigned on 2 June, and Gottwald became president twelve days later.

Within the next few years, bureaucratic centralism under the direction of KSČ leadership was introduced. So-called &quot;dissident&quot; elements were purged from all levels of society, including the Catholic Church. The ideological principles of Marxism-Leninism pervaded cultural and intellectual life. The entire education system was submitted to state control. With the elimination of private ownership of means of production, a planned economy was introduced. Czechoslovakia became a satellite state of the Soviet Union; it was a founding member of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (Comecon) in 1949 and of the Warsaw Pact in 1955. The attainment of Soviet-style &quot;socialism&quot; became the government&#x27;s avowed policy.

Although in theory Czechoslovakia remained a multi-party state, in reality the Communists had complete control of the country. Political participation became subject to KSČ approval. The KSČ also prescribed percentage representation for non-Marxist parties. The National Assembly, purged of dissidents, became a mere rubber stamp for KSČ programmes. In 1953, an inner cabinet of the National Assembly, the Presidium, was created. Composed of KSČ leaders, the Presidium served to convey party policies through government channels. Regional, district, and local committees were subordinated to the Ministry of Interior. Slovak autonomy was constrained; the KSS was reunited with the KSČ but retained its own identity.

After consolidating power, Klement Gottwald began a series of mass purges against both political opponents and fellow Communists, numbering in the tens of thousands. Children from blacklisted families were denied access to good jobs and higher education, there was widespread emigration to West Germany and Austria, and the educational system was reformed to give opportunities to working-class students.

Although Gottwald originally sought a more independent line, a quick meeting with Stalin in 1948 convinced him otherwise and so he sought to impose the Soviet model on the country as thoroughly as possible. By 1951, Gottwald&#x27;s health deteriorated and he was suffering from heart disease and syphilis in addition to alcoholism. He made few public appearances in his final year of life.

Gottwald died on 14 March 1953 from an aortic aneurysm, a week after attending Stalin&#x27;s funeral in Moscow. He was succeeded by Antonín Zápotocký as President and by Antonín Novotný as head of the KSČ. Novotný became President in 1957 when Zápotocký died.

Czechoslovak interests were subordinated to the interests of the Soviet Union. Joseph Stalin became particularly concerned about controlling and integrating the socialist bloc in the wake of Tito&#x27;s challenge to his authority. Stalin&#x27;s paranoia resulted in a campaign against &quot;rootless cosmopolitans&quot; which culminated in the conspiracy theory of the alleged Doctors&#x27; plot. In Czechoslovakia, the Stalinists also accused their opponents of &quot;conspiracy against the people&#x27;s democratic order&quot; and &quot;high treason&quot; in order to oust them from positions of power. Many Communists with an &quot;international&quot; background, i.e., those with a wartime connection with the West, veterans of the Spanish Civil War, Jews, and Slovak &quot;bourgeois nationalists&quot;, were arrested and executed in show trials (e.g., Heliodor Píka, Milada Horáková). Most spectacular was the Slánský trial against KSČ first secretary Rudolf Slánský and thirteen other prominent Communist personalities in November and December 1952. Slánský and ten other defendants were executed, while three were sentenced to life imprisonment. The KSČ rank-and-file membership, approximately 2.5 million in March 1948, began to be subjected to careful scrutiny. By 1960, KSČ membership had been reduced to 1.4 million.

The Ninth-of-May Constitution provided for the nationalisation of all commercial and industrial enterprises having more than fifty employees. The non-agricultural private sector was nearly eliminated. Private ownership of land was limited to fifty hectares. The remnants of private enterprise and independent farming were permitted to carry on only as a temporary concession to the petite bourgeoisie and the peasantry. The Czechoslovak economy was determined by five-year plans.

Following the Soviet example, Czechoslovakia began emphasising the rapid development of heavy industry. The industrial sector was reorganised with an emphasis on metallurgy, heavy machinery, and coal mining. Production was concentrated in larger units; the more than 350,000 units of the pre-war period were reduced to about 1,700 units by 1958. Industrial output reportedly increased 233% between 1948–59 and employment in industry by 44%. The speed of industrialisation was particularly accelerated in Slovakia, where production increased 347% and employment by 70%. Although Czechoslovakia&#x27;s industrial growth of 170% between 1948–57 was huge, it was far exceeded by that of Japan ( who increased by 300%) and West Germany (almost 300 percent) and more than equalled by Austria and Greece. For the 1954–59 period, France and Italy equalled Czechoslovak industrial growth.

Industrial growth in Czechoslovakia required substantial additional labour. Czechoslovaks were subjected to long hours and long working weeks to meet production quotas. Part-time, volunteer labour – students and white-collar workers – was drafted in massive numbers. Labour productivity, however, was not significantly increased; nor were production costs reduced. Czechoslovak products were characterised by poor quality. During the early years of Communist rule, many political prisoners were sentenced to penal labour.

The Ninth-of-May Constitution declared the government&#x27;s intention to collectivise agriculture. In February 1949, the National Assembly adopted the Unified Agricultural Cooperatives Act. Cooperatives were to be founded on a voluntary basis; formal title to land was left vested in the original owners. The imposition of high compulsory quotas, however, forced peasants to collectivise in order to increase efficiency and facilitate mechanisation. Discriminatory policies were employed to bring about the ruin of recalcitrant kulaks (wealthy peasants). Collectivisation was near completion by 1960. 16% of all farmland (obtained from collaborators and kulaks) had been turned into state-run farms. Despite the elimination of poor land from cultivation and a tremendous increase in the use of fertilisers and tractors, agricultural production declined seriously. By 1959, pre-war production levels still had not been met. Major causes of the decline were the diversion of labour from agriculture to industry (in 1948 an estimated 2.2 million workers were employed in agriculture; by 1960, only 1.5 million); the suppression of the kulak, the most experienced and productive farmer; and the peasantry&#x27;s opposition to collectivisation, which resulted in sabotage.

The 1960 Constitution of Czechoslovakia declared the victory of &quot;socialism&quot; and proclaimed the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. The ambiguous precept of &quot;democratic centralism&quot; – power emanating from the people but bound by the authority of higher organs – was made a formal part of constitutional law. The President, the Cabinet, the Slovak National Council, and the local governments were made responsible to the National Assembly. The National Assembly, however, continued its rubber-stamp approval of KSČ policies. All private enterprises using hired labour were abolished. Comprehensive economic planning was reaffirmed. The Bill of Rights emphasised economic and social rights, (e.g the right to work, leisure, health care, and education), with less emphasis on civil rights. The judiciary was combined with the prosecuting branch; all judges were committed to the protection of the socialist state and the education of citizens in loyalty to the cause of socialism.

==De-Stalinization==

De-Stalinization had a late start in Czechoslovakia. The KSČ leadership virtually ignored the Soviet law announced by Nikita Khrushchev 25 February 1956 at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In Czechoslovakia that April, at the Second Writers&#x27; Congress, several authors criticized acts of political repression and attempted to gain control of the writers&#x27; congress. The writers&#x27; rebellion was suppressed, however, and the conservatives retained control. Students in Prague and Bratislava demonstrated on May Day of 1956, demanding freedom of speech and access to the Western press. The Novotný regime condemned these activities and introduced a policy of neo-Stalinism. 
After the Hungarian Revolution of October 1956 had been suppressed by Russian tanks and troops, many Czechs lost courage.

The 1958 KSČ Party Congress (XI. Congress, 18 June − 21 June) formalized the continuation of Stalinism.

In the early 1960s, the Economy of Czechoslovakia became severely stagnated. The industrial growth rate was the lowest in Eastern Europe. Food imports strained the balance of payments. Pressures both from Moscow and from within the party precipitated a reform movement. In 1963 reform-minded Communist intellectuals produced a proliferation of critical articles. Criticism of economic planning merged with more generalized protests against KSČ bureaucratic control and ideological conformity. The KSČ leadership responded. The purge trials of 1949–54 were reviewed, for example, and some of those purged were rehabilitated. Some hardliners were removed from top levels of government and replaced by younger, more liberal communists. Jozef Lenart replaced Prime Minister Viliam Široký in September 1963. The KSČ organized committees to review economic policy.

In 1965, the party approved the New Economic Model, which had been drafted under the direction of economist and theoretician Ota Šik. The program called for a second, intensive stage of economic development, emphasizing technological and managerial improvements. Central planning would be limited to overall production and investment indexes as well as price and wage guidelines. Management personnel would be involved in decision-making. Production would be market oriented and geared toward profitability. Prices would respond to supply and demand. Wage differentials would be introduced.

The KSČ &quot;Theses&quot; of December 1965 presented the party response to the call for political reform. Democratic centralism was redefined, placing a stronger emphasis on democracy. The leading role of the KSČ was reaffirmed but limited. In consequence, the National Assembly was promised increased legislative responsibility. The Slovak executive (Board of Commissioners) and legislature (Slovak National Council) were assured that they could assist the central government in program planning and assume responsibility for program implementation in Slovakia. The regional, district, and local national committees were to be permitted a degree of autonomy. The KSČ agreed to refrain from superseding the authority of economic and social organizations. Party control in cultural policy, however, was reaffirmed.

January 1967 was the date for full implementation of the reform program. Novotný and his supporters hesitated, introducing amendments to reinforce central control. Pressure from the reformists was stepped up. Slovaks pressed for federalization. Economists called for complete enterprise autonomy and economic responsiveness to the market mechanism. The Fourth Writers&#x27; Congress adopted a resolution calling for rehabilitation of the Czechoslovak literary tradition and the establishment of free contact with Western culture. The Novotný regime responded with repressive measures.

At the 30–31 October 1967 meeting of the KSČ Central Committee, Alexander Dubček, a Slovak reformer who had studied in the Soviet Union, challenged Novotný and was accused of nationalism. As university students in Prague demonstrated in support of the liberals, Novotný appealed to Moscow for assistance. On 8 December, Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev arrived in Prague but did not support Novotný, giving a speech to the inner circle of the Communist Party in which he stated: &quot;I did not come to take part in the solution of your problems... ...you will surely manage to solve them on your own.&quot; On 5 January 1968, the Central Committee elected Dubček to replace Novotný as first secretary of the KSČ. Novotný&#x27;s fall from KSČ leadership precipitated initiatives to oust Stalinists from all levels of government, from mass associations, e.g., the Revolutionary Trade Union Movement and the Czechoslovak Union Youth, and from local party organs. On 22 March 1968, Novotný resigned from the presidency and was succeeded by General Ludvík Svoboda.

==Prague Spring==

Dubček carried the reform movement a step further in the direction of liberalism. After Novotný&#x27;s fall, censorship was lifted. The media—press, radio, and television—were mobilized for reformist propaganda purposes. The movement to democratize socialism in Czechoslovakia, formerly confined largely to the party intelligentsia, acquired a new, popular dynamism in the spring of 1968.

In April the KSČ Presidium adopted the Action Programme that had been drafted by a coalition headed by Dubček and made up of reformers, moderates, centrists, and conservatives. The program proposed a &quot;new model of socialism,&quot; profoundly &quot;democratic&quot; and &quot;national,&quot; that is, adapted to Czechoslovak conditions. The National Front and the electoral system were to be democratized, and Czechoslovakia was to be federalized. Freedom of assembly and expression would be guaranteed in constitutional law. The New Economic Model was to be implemented. The Action Program also reaffirmed the Czechoslovak alliance with the Soviet Union and other socialist states. The reform movement, which rejected Stalinism as the road to communism, remained committed to communism as a goal.

The Action Program stipulated that reform must proceed under KSČ direction. In subsequent months, however, popular pressure mounted to implement reforms forthwith. Radical elements found expression: anti-Soviet polemics appeared in the press; the Social Democrats began to form a separate party; new unaffiliated political clubs were created. Party conservatives urged the implementation of repressive measures, but Dubček counselled moderation and reemphasized KSČ leadership. In May he announced that the Fourteenth Party Congress would convene in an early session on 9 September. The congress would incorporate the Action Program into the party statutes, draft a federalization law, and elect a new (presumably more liberal) Central Committee.

On 27 June, Ludvík Vaculík, a lifelong communist and a candidate member of the Central Committee, published a manifesto entitled the &quot;Two Thousand Words&quot;. The manifesto expressed concern about conservative elements within the KSČ and &quot;foreign&quot; forces as well. (Warsaw Pact maneuvers were held in Czechoslovakia in late June.) It called on the &quot;people&quot; to take the initiative in implementing the reform program. Dubček, the party Presidium, the National Front, and the cabinet sharply denounced the manifesto.

The Soviet leadership was alarmed. In mid-July a Warsaw Pact conference was held without Czechoslovak participation. The Warsaw Pact nations drafted a letter to the KSČ leadership referring to the manifesto as an &quot;organizational and political platform of counterrevolution.&quot; Pact members demanded the reimposition of censorship, the banning of new political parties and clubs, and the repression of &quot;rightist&quot; forces within the party. The Warsaw Pact nations declared the defence of Czechoslovakia&#x27;s socialist gains to be not only the task of Czechoslovakia but also the mutual task of all Warsaw Pact countries. The KSČ rejected the Warsaw Pact ultimatum, and Dubček requested bilateral talks with the Soviet Union.

Soviet leader Brezhnev hesitated to intervene militarily in Czechoslovakia. Dubček&#x27;s Action Program proposed a &quot;new model of socialism&quot;—&quot;democratic&quot; and &quot;national.&quot; Significantly, however, Dubček did not challenge Czechoslovak commitment to the Warsaw Pact. In the early spring of 1968, the Soviet leadership adopted a wait-and-see attitude. By midsummer, however, two camps had formed: advocates and opponents of military intervention. The pro-interventionist coalition viewed the situation in Czechoslovakia as &quot;counterrevolutionary&quot; and favoured the defeat of Dubček and his supporters. This coalition was headed by the Ukrainian party leader Petro Shelest and included communist bureaucrats from Belarus and from the non-Russian national republics of the western part of the Soviet Union (the Baltic republics). The coalition members feared the awakening of nationalism within their respective republics and the influence of the Ukrainian minority in Czechoslovakia on Ukrainians in the Soviet Union. Bureaucrats responsible for political stability in Soviet cities and for the ideological supervision of the intellectual community also favoured a military solution. Within the Warsaw Pact, only the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) and Poland were strongly interventionist. Walter Ulbricht and Władysław Gomułka—party leaders of East Germany and Poland, respectively—viewed liberalism as threatening to their own positions.

The Soviet Union agreed to bilateral talks with Czechoslovakia to be held in July at Cierna nad Tisou, Slovak-Soviet border. At the meeting, Dubček defended the program of the reformist wing of the KSČ while pledging commitment to the Warsaw Pact and Comecon. The KSČ leadership, however, was divided. Vigorous reformers—Josef Smrkovský, Oldřich Černík, and František Kriegel—supported Dubček. Conservatives—Vasil Biľak, Drahomír Kolder, and Oldřich Švestka—adopted an anti-reformist stance. Brezhnev decided on compromise. The KSČ delegates reaffirmed their loyalty to the Warsaw Pact and promised to curb &quot;antisocialist&quot; tendencies, prevent the revival of the Czechoslovak Social Democratic Party, and control the press more effectively. The Soviets agreed to withdraw their troops (stationed in Czechoslovakia since the June maneuvers) and permit the 9 September party congress.

On 3 August, representatives from the Soviet Union, East Germany, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Czechoslovakia met in Bratislava and signed the Bratislava Declaration. The declaration affirmed unshakable fidelity to Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism and declared an implacable struggle against &quot;bourgeois&quot; ideology and all &quot;antisocialist&quot; forces. The Soviet Union expressed its intention to intervene in a Warsaw Pact country if a &quot;bourgeois&quot; system—a pluralist system of several political parties—was ever established. After the Bratislava conference, Soviet troops left Czechoslovak territory but remained along Czechoslovak borders. Dubček did not attempt to mobilize the Czechoslovak army to resist an invasion.

The KSČ party congress remained scheduled for 9 September. In the week following the Bratislava conference, it became an open secret in Prague that most of Dubček&#x27;s opponents would be removed from the Central Committee. The Prague municipal party organization prepared and circulated a blacklist. The antireformist coalition could hope to stay in power only with Soviet assistance.

KSČ anti-reformists, therefore, made efforts to convince the Soviets that the danger of political instability and &quot;counterrevolution&quot; did indeed exist. They used the Kaspar Report, prepared by the Central Committee&#x27;s Information Department, headed by Jan Kašpar, to achieve this end. The report provided an extensive review of the general political situation in Czechoslovakia as it might relate to the forthcoming party congress. It predicted that a stable Central Committee and a firm leadership could not necessarily be expected as the outcome of the congress. The party Presidium received the report on 12 August. Two Presidium members, Kolder and Alois Indra, were instructed to evaluate the report for the 20 August meeting of the Presidium. Kolder and Indra viewed the Kašpar Report with alarm and, some observers think, communicated their conclusions to the Soviet ambassador, Stepan Chervonenko. These actions are thought to have precipitated the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. As the KSČ Presidium convened on 20 August, the anti-reformists planned to make a bid for power, pointing to the imminent danger of counterrevolution. Kolder and Indra presented a resolution declaring a state of emergency and calling for &quot;fraternal assistance.&quot; The resolution was never voted on, because the Warsaw Pact troops entered Czechoslovakia that same day (in the night of 20 August-21).

===Warsaw Pact intervention and the end of Prague Spring===

KSČ conservatives had misinformed Moscow regarding the strength of the reform movement. The KSČ Presidium met during the night of 20–21 August; it rejected the option of armed resistance and condemned the invasion. Two-thirds of the KSČ Central Committee opposed the Soviet intervention. A KSČ party congress, convened secretly on 22 August, passed a resolution affirming its loyalty to Dubček&#x27;s Action Program and denouncing the Soviet aggression. President Svoboda repeatedly resisted Soviet pressure to form a new government under Indra. The Czechoslovak population was virtually unanimous in its repudiation of the Soviet action. In compliance with Svoboda&#x27;s caution against acts that might provoke violence, they avoided mass demonstrations and strikes but observed a symbolic one-hour general work stoppage on 23 August.

Popular opposition was expressed in numerous spontaneous acts of nonviolent resistance, also called civil resistance. In Prague and other cities throughout the republic, Czechs and Slovaks greeted Warsaw Pact soldiers with arguments and reproaches. Every form of assistance, including the provision of food and water, was denied the invaders. Signs, placards, and graffiti drawn on walls and pavements denounced the invaders, the Soviet leaders, and suspected collaborators. Pictures of Dubček and Svoboda appeared everywhere.

The generalized resistance caused the Soviet Union to abandon its original plan to oust Dubček. Dubček, who had been arrested on the night of 20 August, was taken to Moscow for negotiations. The outcome was the Brezhnev Doctrine of limited sovereignty, which provided for the strengthening of the KSČ, strict party control of the media, and the suppression of the Czechoslovak Social Democratic Party. It was agreed that Dubček would remain in office and that a program of moderate reform would continue.

On 19 January 1969, student Jan Palach set himself on fire in Prague&#x27;s Wenceslas Square as a protest against the end of the reforms of the Prague Spring following the Soviet invasion.

==Normalization==

Dubček remained in office only until April 1969. Anti-Soviet demonstrations, following Czechoslovakia&#x27;s victory over the Soviet team in the World Ice Hockey Championships in March, precipitated Soviet pressures for a KSČ Presidium reorganization. Gustáv Husák, (a centrist and one of the Slovak &quot;bourgeois nationalists&quot; imprisoned by the KSČ in the 1950s), was named first secretary (title changed to general secretary in 1971). Only centrists and the hardliners led by Vasil Bilak continued in the Presidium.

A program of &quot;normalization&quot;—the restoration of continuity with the prereform period—was initiated. Normalization entailed thoroughgoing political repression and the return to ideological conformity
*consolidate the Husák leadership and remove reformers from leadership positions;
*revoke or modify the laws enacted by the reform movement;
*reestablish centralized control over the economy;
*reinstate the power of police authorities; and
*expand Czechoslovakia&#x27;s ties with other socialist nations.
One of the few changes proposed by the Action Programme during the Prague Spring that was actually achieved was the federalization of the country. Although it was mostly a formality during the normalization period, Czechoslovakia had been federalized under the Constitutional Law of Federation of 27 October 1968. The newly created Federal Assembly (i.e., federal parliament), which replaced the National Assembly, was intended to work in close cooperation with the Czech National Council and the Slovak National Council (i.e., national parliaments). The Gustáv Husák regime amended the law in January 1971 so that, while federalism was retained in form, central authority was effectively restored.
In the meantime, a Slovak parliament and government had been created, including all ministries except for defence and foreign affairs. Besides, a so-called no-majorisation principle requiring consensus between Czechia and Slovakia at the Federal Assembly in Prague was enacted. But due to the fact that neither governments nor parliaments made political decisions under the regime, it remained just a formality. Decisions were taken &quot;by the politburo of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. There was one communist party and it was situated in Prague&quot;. Deciding about Slovak affairs in Slovakia was not allowed to happen.

At the official Fourteenth Party Congress in May 1971, party chief Husák announced the 1968 Fourteenth Party Congress had been abrogated, that &quot;normalization&quot; had been &quot;completed&quot; and that all the party needed to do was consolidate its gains. Husák&#x27;s policy was to maintain a rigid status quo; for the next fifteen years, key personnel of the party and government remained the same. In 1975, Husák added the position of president to his post as party chief. He and other party leaders faced the task of rebuilding general party membership after the purges of 1969–71. By 1983, membership had returned to 1.6 million, about the same as in 1960.

In preserving the status quo, the Husák regime required conformity and obedience in all aspects of life. Czech and Slovak culture suffered greatly from the limitations on independent thought, as did the humanities, social sciences, and ultimately even natural sciences. Art had to adhere to a rigid formula of socialist realism. Soviet examples were held up for emulation. During the 1970s and 1980s, many of Czechoslovakia&#x27;s most creative individuals were silenced, imprisoned, or sent into exile. Some found expression for their art through samizdat. Those artists, poets, and writers who were officially sanctioned were, for the most part, undistinguished. The award of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1984 to Jaroslav Seifert—a poet identified with reformism and not favored by the Husák regime—was a bright spot in an otherwise bleak cultural scene.

In addition to applying repression, Husák also tried to obtain acquiescence to his rule by providing an improved standard of living. He returned Czechoslovakia to an orthodox command economy with a heavy emphasis on central planning and continued to extend industrialization. For a while, the policy seemed successful because, despite the lack of investment in new technologies, there was an increase in industrial output. The government encouraged consumerism and materialism and took a tolerant attitude toward a slack work ethic and a growing black market second economy:
* In the early 1970s, there was a steady increase in the standard of living; it seemed that the improved economy might mitigate political and cultural oppression and give the government a modicum of legitimacy.
*By the mid-1970s, consumerism failed as a palliative for political oppression. The government could not sustain an indefinite expansion without coming to grips with limitations inherent in a command economy. The effects of the 1973 oil crisis further exacerbated the economic decline. Materialism, encouraged by a corrupt government, also produced cynicism, greed, nepotism, corruption, and a lack of work discipline. Whatever elements of a social contract the government tried to establish with Czechoslovak society crumbled with the decline in living standards of the mid-1970s.
* The 1980s were more or less a period of economic stagnation.

Another feature of Husák&#x27;s rule was a continued dependence on the Soviet Union. As of the mid-1980s, Husák had not yet achieved a balance between what could be perceived as Czechoslovak national interest and Soviet dictate. In foreign policy, Czechoslovakia parroted every utterance of the Soviet position. Frequent contacts between the Soviet and Czechoslovak communist parties and governments made certain that the Soviet position on any issue was both understood and followed. The Soviets continued to exert control over Czechoslovak internal affairs, including oversight over the police and security apparatus. Five Soviet ground divisions and two air divisions had become a permanent fixture, while the Czechoslovak military was further integrated into the Warsaw Pact. In the 1980s, approximately 50% of Czechoslovakia&#x27;s foreign trade was with the Soviet Union, and almost 80% was with communist countries. There were constant exhortations about further cooperation and integration between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia in industry, science, technology, consumer goods, and agriculture. Deriving its legitimacy from Moscow, the Husák regime remained a slavish imitator of political, cultural, and economic trends emanating from Moscow.

==Dissent and independent activity (1970s and 1980s)==
Through the 1970s and 1980s, the government&#x27;s emphasis on obedience, conformity, and the preservation of the status quo was challenged by individuals and organized groups aspiring to independent thinking and activity. Although only a few such activities could be deemed political by Western standards, the state viewed any independent action, no matter how innocuous, as a defiance of the party&#x27;s control over all aspects of Czechoslovak life. The government&#x27;s response to such activity was harassment, persecution, and, in some instances, imprisonment.

In the context of international detente, Czechoslovakia had signed the United Nations Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights and the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1968. In 1975 these were ratified by the Federal Assembly, which, according to the Constitution of 1960, is the highest legislative organization. The Helsinki Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe&#x27;s &quot;Final Act&quot; (also known as the Helsinki Accords), signed by Czechoslovakia in 1975, also included guarantees of human rights.

The first organized opposition emerged under the umbrella of Charter 77. On 6 January 1977, a manifesto called Charter 77 appeared in West German newspapers. The document was immediately translated and reprinted throughout the world. The original manifesto reportedly was signed by 243 people; among them were artists, former public officials, and other prominent figures, such as Zdeněk Mlynář, secretary of the KSČ Central Committee in 1968; Václav Slavík, a Central Committee member in 1968; and Ludvík Vaculík, author of &quot;Two Thousand Words.&quot; Charter 77 defined itself as &quot;a loose, informal, and open community of people&quot; concerned with the protection of civil and human rights. It denied oppositional intent and based its defense of rights on legally binding international documents signed by the Czechoslovak government and on guarantees of civil rights contained in the Czechoslovak Constitution. The Charter 77 group declared its objectives to be the following: to draw attention to individual cases of human rights infringements; to suggest remedies; to make general proposals to strengthen rights and freedoms and the mechanisms designed to protect them; and to act as intermediary in situations of conflict. The Charter had over 800 signatures by the end of 1977, including workers and youth; by 1985 nearly 1,200 Czechoslovaks had signed the Charter. The Husák regime, which claimed that all rights derive from the state and that international covenants are subject to the internal jurisdiction of the state, responded with fury to the Charter. The text was never published in the official media. Signatories were arrested and interrogated; dismissal from employment often followed. The Czechoslovak press launched vicious attacks against the Charter. The public was mobilized to sign either individual condemnations or various forms of &quot;anti-Charters.&quot;

Closely associated with Charter 77, the Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly Persecuted (Výbor na obranu nespravedlivě stíhaných—VONS) was formed in 1978 with the specific goal of documenting individual cases of government persecution and human rights violations. Between 1978 and 1984, VONS issued 409 communiques concerning individuals prosecuted or harassed.

On a larger scale, independent activity was expressed through underground writing and publishing. Because of the decentralized nature of underground writing, it is difficult to estimate its extent or impact. Hundreds of books, journals, essays, and short stories were published and distributed. In the mid-1980s, several samizdat publishing houses were in operation. The best known was Edice Petlice (Padlock Editions), which had published more than 250 volumes. There were a number of clandestine religious publishing houses that published journals in photocopy or printed form. The production and distribution of underground literature was difficult. In most cases, manuscripts had to be typed and retyped without the aid of modern publishing equipment. Publication and distribution were also dangerous. Mere possession of samizdat materials could be the basis for harassment, loss of employment, and arrest and imprisonment.

Independent activity also extended to music. The state was particularly concerned about the impact of Western popular music on Czechoslovak youth. The persecution of rock musicians and their fans led a number of musicians to sign Charter 77. In the forefront of the struggle for independent music was the Jazz Section of the Union of Musicians. Initially organized to promote jazz, in the late 1970s it became a protector of various kinds of nonconformist music. The widely popular Jazz Section had a membership of approximately 7,000 and received no official funds. It published music and promoted concerts and festivals. The government condemned the Jazz Section for spreading &quot;unacceptable views&quot; among the youth and moved against its leadership. In March 1985, the Jazz Section was dissolved under a 1968 statute banning &quot;counterrevolutionary activities.&quot; The Jazz Section continued to operate, however, and in 1986 the government arrested the members of its steering committee.

Because religion offered possibilities for thought and activities independent of the state, it too was severely restricted and controlled. Clergymen were required to be licensed. In attempting to manipulate the number and kind of clergy, the state even sponsored a pro-government organization of Catholic priests, the Association of Catholic Clergy Pacem in Terris. Nevertheless, there was religious opposition, including a lively Catholic samizdat. In the 1980s, Cardinal František Tomášek, the Czech primate, adopted a more independent stand. In 1984 he invited the Pope to come to Czechoslovakia for the 1,100th anniversary of the death of Saint Methodius, the missionary to the Slavs. The pope accepted, but the trip was blocked by the government. The cardinal&#x27;s invitation and the pope&#x27;s acceptance were widely circulated in samizdat. A petition requesting the government to permit the papal visit had 17,000 signatories. The Catholic Church did have a massive commemoration of the 1,100th anniversary in 1985. At Velehrad (allegedly the site of Methodius&#x27;s tomb) more than 150,000 pilgrims attended a commemorative mass, and another 100,000 came to a ceremony at Levoca (in eastern Slovakia).

Unlike in Poland, dissent, opposition to the government, and independent activity were limited in Czechoslovakia to a fairly small segment of the populace. Even the dissenters saw scant prospect for fundamental reforms. In this sense, the Husák regime was successful in preserving the status quo in &quot;normalized&quot; Czechoslovakia.

The selection of Mikhail Gorbachev as general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on 11 March 1985, presented the Husák regime with a new and unexpected challenge to the status quo. Soon after assuming office, Gorbachev began a policy of &quot;perestroika&quot; (&quot;restructuring&quot;) the Soviet economy and advocated &quot;glasnost&quot; (&quot;openness&quot;) in the discussion of economic, social, and, to some extent, political questions. Up to this time, the Husák regime had dutifully adopted the programs and slogans that had emanated from Moscow. But, for a government wholly dedicated to the preservation of the status quo, subjects such as &quot;openness,&quot; economic &quot;restructuring,&quot; and &quot;reform&quot; had been taboo.

<text>The flag of the United States Marine Corps is the flag used to represent the U.S. Marine Corps, as well as its subsidiary units and formations.

==Design==
===Official battle color of the U.S. Marine Corps===

The official flag is scarlet with the Corps emblem in gray and gold. It was adopted on January 18, 1939, although Marine Corps Order 4 had established scarlet and gold as the official colors of the Corps as early as 1925. The indoor/parade version is bordered by a gold fringe while the outdoor version is plain. It measures on the hoist and on the fly. In addition to the multi-colored battle streamers (measuring by wide) affixed to the top of the staff, the staff itself is covered with sterling silver bands engraved with the names of conflicts in which the Corps has been engaged.

==History==
Very little information is available regarding the flags carried by early American marines, although indications are that the Grand Union Flag was carried ashore by the battalion led by Captain Samuel Nicholas on New Providence Island on March 3, 1776. It is quite possible that the Gadsden flag was also carried on this expedition.

The standard carried by the Marines during the 1830s and the 1840s consisted of a white field with gold fringe, and bore an elaborate design of an anchor and eagle in the center. Prior to the Mexican–American War, this flag bore the legend &quot;To the Shores of Tripoli&quot; across the top. Shortly after the war, the legend was revised to read: &quot;From Tripoli to the Halls of the Montezumas.&quot;

During the Mexican and Civil Wars, Marines in the field apparently carried a flag similar to the national flag, consisting of red and white stripes and a union. The union, however, contained an eagle perched on a shield of the United States and a half-wreath beneath the shield, with 29 stars encircling the entire design. Beginning in 1876, Marines carried the national colors (the Stars and Stripes) with &quot;U.S. Marine Corps&quot; embroidered in yellow on the middle red stripe.

At the time of the Vera Cruz landing in 1914, a more distinctive standard was carried by Marines. The design consisted of a blue field with a laurel wreath encircling the Marine Corps emblem in the center. A scarlet ribbon above the emblem carried the words &quot;U.S. Marine Corps,&quot; while another scarlet ribbon below the emblem carried the motto &quot;Semper Fidelis.&quot;

Orders were issued on April 2, 1921 which directed all national colors be manufactured without the yellow fringe and without the words &quot;U.S. Marine Corps&quot; embroidered on the red stripe. This was followed by an order dated March 14, 1922, retiring from use all national colors still in use with yellow fringe or wording on the flag. Following World War I, the Army practice of attaching silver bands carrying inscriptions enumerating specific decorations and battles was adopted. This practice was discontinued on January 23, 1961.

Marine Corps Order No. 4 of April 18, 1925 designated gold and scarlet as the official colors of the U.S. Marine Corps. These colors, however, were not reflected in the official Marine Corps standard until January 18, 1939, when a new design incorporating the new colors was approved. The design was essentially that of today&#x27;s Marine Corps standard.

For a brief time following World War I, the inscribing of battle honors directly on the colors of a unit was in practice, but realization that a multiplicity of honors and the limited space on the colors made the system impractical, and the procedure was discontinued. On July 29, 1936, a Marine Corps Board recommended that the Army system of attaching streamers to the staff of the organizational colors be adopted. Such a system was finally authorized by Marine Corps Order No. 157, dated November 3, 1939, and is currently in practice. Devices are embroidered onto the streamer to denote special recognition or repeat awards. Unlike the Army and Air Force flags, only a single streamer is utilized for a single campaign, with the exception of those streamers that require more than eight devices, the maximum any one streamer may hold. Devices are only authorized for campaigns participated in the 20th and 21st centuries.

===Color Sergeant===
The official battle color of the Corps is maintained by Marine Barracks, Washington, D.C. (&quot;8th and I&quot;), and carried by the Color Sergeant of the Marine Corps. The position of the Color Sergeant was first officially designated in 1965 and was first held by Gunnery Sgt. Shelton L. Eakin. The billet is a two-year tour open to all Sergeants; the only caveat being that the applicant must be at least tall, as outlined by the drill manual of the United States Marine Corp. and pass a rigorous White House security check. The Color Sergeant of the Marine Corps traditionally carries the flag of the president of the United States at state dinners and other official functions, and leads the color guard at various parades and ceremonies.

===Streamers===
The following streamers are authorized, in order of precedence:

* &quot;Note that a &quot;x #&quot; designation denotes the number of streamers used to carry devices (maximum of 8), not the number of awards.&quot;

==Organizational Battle Colors==

Each unit in the Corps of battalion-size or larger also hold an organizational color (which makes up the unit&#x27;s colors along with the national flag). It is usually identical to the Marine Corps battle color, though the scroll will have the unit&#x27;s name instead of &quot;United States Marine Corps&quot;. It will also bear the streamers authorized to the unit, or scarlet and gold tassels if none are authorized.

Each Corps unit has a designated color guard, led by a color sergeant. He is entrusted with the care of the unit colors, which are a symbol of the United States, the Marine Corps, and the commander him/herself. The organizational colors are often passed as part of change of command ceremonies to symbolize the transfer of office. When not in use as part of a parade or ceremony, the colors are traditionally kept in the commander&#x27;s office.

==Guidons==

A Marine guidon is always rectangular, , with a scarlet field and gold lettering, and an Eagle, Globe, and Anchor centered.

Fleet Marine Forces units have &quot;FMF&quot; emblazoned above an Eagle, Globe, and Anchor (EGA), reserve units display &quot;USMCR&quot;, and all others have &quot;USMC&quot;. The regimental level numeral will be displayed in the lower left corner, unless a higher or lower command numeral provides better identification (for example, a battalion&#x27;s headquarters company would display that battalion&#x27;s numeral instead of the regiment). The company-level designation letter, abbreviated title, or number will be in the lower right corner.

No additional attachments are authorized, including streamers, bands, or the like. Some units incorporate additional banners or mascots into unofficial guidons.

Guidons are used in the same manner as colors for a company- or platoon-sized unit. Much like the colors, the guidon represents the unit commander. It is entrusted to the unit guide for parades and ceremonies, and displayed in or near the commander&#x27;s office when he or she is present.

Guidons are also used in recruit training to identify individual platoons. First and second phase platoons have a gold background with their four-digit platoon number in scarlet, while third phase platoons have a scarlet background with gold lettering and trim. The guidon is used as an aid to instilling unit identity and pride, representing the platoon. Some drill instructors will test that pride by attempting to dishonor the guidon and expecting the recruits to intervene. Also, the recruit assigned to carry it, the guide, is treated as the most senior recruit of the platoon, and uses the guidon to marks the line of advance in close order drill.

==Personal flags==
General-grade officers and the Commandant of the Marine Corps are authorized a personal flag, which displays their rank insignia. A red background with white stars are used, while the Commandant also has a grey and gold Eagle, Globe, and Anchor. These flags are often used to mark a command headquarters in garrison, as well as a symbol for the general themself. Much like a guidon, they are displayed when the general is present, and stowed when not; visiting officers and officials often have their personal flags displayed as a courtesy.
==Shared aspects==
All U.S. Marine flags share a similar wooden staff and silver spearhead and ferrule. The base of the spearhead is used to support streamers or tassels if authorized. Older organizational colors may also have silver bands, awarded for participation in a battle or campaign, though the practice has been discontinued for all but the Corp&#x27;s main battle colors.

A color mounted on a vehicle of some type is referred to as a standard. When the national flag is flown from a ship, it is referred to as the national ensign.

<text>Kurt Erik Nilsen () (born 29 September 1978) is a Norwegian pop/country singer. He won the first season of the Norwegian reality show &quot;Idol&quot;, which aired on TV 2 in May 2003. He then won a one-off international version of &quot;Pop Idol&quot; called &quot;World Idol&quot; on 1 January 2004, featuring winners of the various national &quot;Idol&quot; shows.

==Career==

===&quot;Idol&quot;===
Upon leaving school, Nilsen made his living as a plumber. Nilsen became the lead singer in the Norwegian band &quot;Fenrik Lane&quot;. He is a left-handed musician and plays his guitar with the strings upside down. He appeared on and won &quot;Norwegian Idol&quot; with 54% of the votes against Gaute Ormåsen. He is one of only seven contestants in the Norwegian &quot;Idol&quot; history who succeeded in staying out of the &quot;bottom three/two&quot; places in weekly votes.

His subsequent single, &quot;She&#x27;s So High&quot;, written by Tal Bachman, went straight to number one in the Norwegian VG-lista singles chart and is among the biggest-selling singles in Norway to date. His debut album was simply called &quot;I&quot;.

===&quot;World Idol&quot;===
He subsequently won the title for the &quot;World Idol&quot; on 1 January 2004, singing the hit &quot;Beautiful Day&quot; by U2, beating competitors from ten other nations, including the more famous &quot;Idol&quot; winners, Britain&#x27;s Will Young, and favourite Kelly Clarkson of the United States, and scoring the first place in 10 out of 11 countries eligible to vote for him (Norwegian voters being unable to vote for him).

In the show presenting the entries on 25 December, Ian Dickson, the Australian (English ex-pat) judge, said: &quot;Kurt, you are a hell of a marketing challenge, because you have the voice of an angel, but you look like a Hobbit.&quot; The comment made Nilsen laugh out loud.

===Post-&quot;Idol&quot; career ===
His second CD, &quot;A Part of Me&quot;, released in 2004, contains only his own material.

Nilsen performed the duet, &quot;It&#x27;s All Coming Back to Me Now&quot;, alongside Norwegian Pop/Alternative Rocker, Marion Raven at the One Call Event. Taking the place of Meat Loaf, with whom Raven recorded the track for the album &quot;Bat Out of Hell III&quot; 

In 2006, he and three other Norwegian artists Askil Holm, Espen Lind, and Alejandro Fuentes, all in the same management, joined forces and went on tour in March as what was known by the media as &quot;The New Guitar Buddies&quot;.

Initially, they planned a short tour (five to six concerts), but ended up playing for more than 100,000 people during their tour of around 30 concerts. Although they had not planned to, they subsequently released a live album from that tour.

Nilsen performed the duet &quot;When You&#x27;re Gone&quot; alongside English pop singer, and former-Spice Girls member, Melanie C at the Top 20 event at Rådhusplassen in Oslo, Norway in the summer of 2007.

In 2008, in connection with his latest and country-flavoured album &quot;Rise to the Occasion&quot; Kurt teamed up with American music legend Willie Nelson to perform the old country music standard &quot;Lost Highway&quot;. The song was an instant hit in his native Norway and helped him top both the singles chart, the album chart, and the radio chart all at once.

In 2009, &quot;The New Guitar Buddies&quot; was back with a new tour and a new album, including one concert on 9 May 2009 at Rockefeller Oslo.

Spring 2010 saw Kurt touring Norway with an acoustic concert tour in intimate concert halls. His guest artist was Elin Gaustad, who was a competitor in Norway&#x27;s first X Factor show in 2009. In late February 2010, Kurt and Elin sang the duet &quot;The Water is Wide&quot; on the TV2 show Senkveld, to great acclaim.

In 2010, Kurt recorded a Christmas song album entitled &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&quot; with the Kringkastingsorkester (KORK), the Norwegian Radio Orchestra. It was released on 15 November 2010 in Norway. He performed with this orchestra and some guest artists at Lillestrøm messecenter, near Oslo on 18 December 2010. It was broadcast live on NRK television. The album stayed at the top of the Norwegian Albums Chart for 5 consecutive weeks (48/2010 to 52/2010)

2011 saw Kurt going on the road on a new tour in addition to playing at several music festivals and venues.

On 15 September 2012, it was announced on the official Norwegian &quot;Idol&quot; website that Kurt would be the second of an all-new four-member jury of former Idol contestants to celebrate 10 years since the debut of &quot;Idol&quot; in Norway. Another judge joining in was season three runner-up Tone Damli Aaberge.

==Personal life==

In January 2005, Nilsen broke up with his fiancée, Kristine Jacobsen. They had been together for 11 years and had two children together: Marte (born 1996) and Erik (born 2000). In January 2006, Kurt&#x27;s new girlfriend Kristin gave birth to her first and Nilsen&#x27;s third child, Lucas. They married later that year, then separated in May 2013.

Nilsen has received national attention for his guitar-shaped alpine hut, in the Hardangervidda in Norway.

<text>The British Aerospace ATP (Advanced Turbo-Prop) is an airliner designed and produced by British Aerospace. It was an evolution of the Hawker Siddeley HS 748, a fairly successful feederliner of the 1960s.

The ATP was developed during the 1980s, events such as such as the 1979 oil crisis and increasing public concern regarding aircraft noise led business planners at British Aerospace to believe that there was a market for a short-range, low-noise, fuel-efficient turboprop aircraft. First flown on 6 August 1986, by the time it became commercially available, the market segment it fell within was already hotly contested by multiple other airliners, such as the de Havilland Canada Dash 8, ATR 42, and ATR 72. Amid this intense competition, sales of the ATP were limited, leading British Aerospace to terminate production after only eight years, during which a total of 65 aircraft were completed.

The final European operator of the ATP, West Air Sweden, made a final repositioning flight on 24 February 2023. Thus marking the end of the type’s primary active service. As of March 2023, there are only four airframes in active service. 

==Design and development==
===Background===
The origins of the ATP can be traced back to, in part, the 1979 oil crisis, which had caused dramatic rises in fuel prices; there was considerable attention paid to the possibility of another such event, thus operators came to place greater value on the fuel efficiency of their aircraft. Another factor that had gained prominence around this time was noise pollution. Recognising these trends, British Aerospace decided that it would assign a design team to produce an airliner, suitable for short- to medium-haul operations, that would be both more fuel efficient and quieter than the prior generations of aircraft.

It was quickly decided that a development of the existing Hawker Siddeley HS 748 airliner would be the preferred option. The airframe was redesigned with a lengthened fuselage and a larger wing span. the airliner was originally designed to accommodate 64 passengers, although the actual capacity could change considerably dependent on customer configuration, and was sized to slot between the original HS 748&#x27;s capacity of 50 seats and the jet-powered British Aerospace 146&#x27;s capacity of 100 seats. The aircraft was also designed to be compliant with the latest regulations pertaining to air travel in both Europe and the United States.

The cockpit was also redesigned to ease pilot workload using measures such as colour-coded instrumentation and a centralised fault warning panel. Equipped with digital avionics and multifunction displays, it was considered to be a glass cockpit. Various other minor modifications were performed across the airframe, such as the reshaping of areas such as the more pointed nose, the tail unit&#x27;s swept fin and rudder, and revised wingtips. Furthermore, the windows were reduced in size and had a shorter pitch than those of the HS 748. There was a 30% commonality between the two aircraft.

The propulsion was significantly revised from that of the HS 748; the twin Rolls-Royce Dart turboprop engines of its predecessor were substituted for Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PW126 engines, a more modern counterpart. Each engine drove a custom-designed six-blade propeller jointly developed by British Aerospace and the American specialist Hamilton Standard. These large diameter propellers were designed to turn slower than traditional equivalents to generate less noise; their distance from the fuselage meant that passengers were subject to noise levels comparable to contemporary jetliners. The airliner was also relatively lightweight, weighing only 468 pounds per seat, which was reportedly less than any other regional airliner in its size category in the mid-1980s. Partially as a result of these refinements, the aircraft&#x27;s cruise speed was increased considerably over that of its predecessor. The project&#x27;s existence was revealed to the public in early 1984.

===Into flight===
On 6 August 1986, the prototype ATP performed its maiden flight from Manchester Airport, flown by test pilot Robby Robinson. This initial flight, which lasted several hours, was relatively non-notable, except for adverse weather conditions being present for the type&#x27;s first landing. At the time of this first flight, the company expected the ATP to enter revenue service during 1987.

Between 1987 and 2002, BAe reportedly held ambitions to sell around 300 ATPs. It proved to be far more economic than preceding aircraft used for the role, such as the BAC 1-11 and the Douglas DC9 jetliners. However, throughout the ATP&#x27;s production run, the regional airline market was hotly contested by numerous companies, including the Dutch aircraft company Fokker, Canadian transport manufacturer Bombardier, and the European specialist ATR. This led to BAe investigating potential partnerships amongst its competitors, ultimately resulting in the short-lived merger of its regional airliner manufacturing division with ATR under the name Aero International (Regional) on 26 January 1995.

Assembly of the type was largely undertaken at BAe&#x27;s Woodford and Prestwick facilities, while the manufacture of both the airframe and wings was performed at the Chadderton plant. During mid 1997, BAe announced that production of the ATP was permanently terminated; work at the Prestwick was promptly shifted to the aerostructures sector. By this point, a total of 65 aircraft had been completed.

During July 2000, a project was announced that resulted in the conversion of existing aircraft into the &quot;ATP Freighter&quot; (ATPF) configuration, which was promoted to cargo operators. Outfitted with a modified freight door derived from that of the HS 748, the ATPF can carry 30% more cargo than its predecessor with a 10% increase in running costs. Under this programme, an initial batch of six ATPs were converted into freighter on behalf of the cargo airline West Air Sweden.

==Operational history==

During 1988, the ATP entered commercial service with the regional airline British Midland. Numerous British airliners were quick to adopt and operate the type, including British Airways, Loganair, and British Regional Airlines. During the 1990s, various charter operators also adopted small fleets of ATPs. The air ferry company British World Airlines also opted to acquire several ATPs in a quick change configuration.

During the late 1990s, the Scandinavian airline Sun-Air initiated a long-term plan to introduce jet-powered airliners into its fleet by 2000; as a step towards this, and to help handle increasing passenger traffic on its routes between Denmark and Britain, the company acquired a pair of second-hand ATPs during late 1997; further aircraft would follow. Around the same timeframe, the Spanish operator Air Europa Express became a sizable user of the type; in August 1998, it announced its intention to double its ATP fleet from six to 12 aircraft.

Early sales efforts had been particularly focused on the North American market, BAE reportedly held negotiations with numerous carriers across the continent; the first success was an order for five ATPs from the Canadian carrier Avline. In September 1987, the American operator Wings West Airlines announced that it had picked the ATP as the winner of an international competition; the initial order for 10 airliners represented the ATP&#x27;s breakthrough into the lucrative US market. Carl Albert, President and Chief Executive of Wings West, stated that the ATP was superior to its closest competitors, such as the De Havilland Canada Dash 8 and the Fokker 50, and claimed it offered the lowest seat-mile costs of any turboprop airliner. In practice, the only U.S. operator of the ATP in scheduled passenger service was Air Wisconsin, which flew as United Express on behalf of United Airlines via a code sharing agreement.

During the mid-2000s, the ATP was being increasingly used to carry aerial freight with numerous operators. By December 2021, 12 aircraft reportedly remained in commercial service as cargo aircraft with West Air Sweden (10) and Deraya (2).

==Variants==
Several ATP variants were proposed and produced for civil and military use:
;Jetstream 61
The British Aerospace Jetstream 61 was an improved derivative of the ATP. It featured an interior based on the Jetstream 41, with innovative cabin wall armrests and an increase in capacity from 64 to 70 seats. In addition, the airframe incorporated more powerful PW127 engines and increased weights and range.

For Farnborough, the original prototype ATP (serial number 2001) was re-painted in a J61 scheme and re-registered G-PLXI (LXI being the Roman numeral for 61. The first flight of a proper J61 aircraft was by 2064 G-JLXI on 10 May 1994 from Prestwick. Four airframes were produced as Jetstream 61s, 2065 being the only other to have flown before British Aerospace&#x27;s regional airliner manufacturing operations were merged with ATR as Aero International (Regional) on 26 January 1995. With the already highly successful ATR 72 now part of the same product range, the Jetstream 61 was immediately cancelled with all four airframes being scrapped at Prestwick.

;Maritime ATP
This was a variant for use in military naval operations, with a surveillance radar under the forward fuselage, nose-mounted FLIR and internal sonar buoys. A suite of special crew stations also featured, as did a choice of up to six weapon pylons under the wings and fuselage. The Maritime ATP was later known as the BAe P.132. None were built.

;ATP-AEW
The AEW was a 1986 proposal for an Airborne Early Warning aircraft for Australia, with two EMI Skymaster radars in nose and tail radomes, similar in appearance to the Nimrod AEW.3. None were built.

==Operators==
===Current operators===
As of March 2024, there are 8 airframes still in active service, all in Kenya. These airframes had all been placed in storage by their previous operators, West Air Sweden (7) and NextJet (1) and have been re-introduced to service between March 2018 and February 2024. The rest of the production line is now either in storage (15), preserved (4), or scrapped. These remaining operators are:

* Aerospace Consortium
* Transafrican Air
* Encomm Airlines

==Notable accidents and incidents==
* On 19 April 1997, Merpati Nusantara Airlines Flight 106 lost control at 2,000 feet on approach to Tanjung Pandan Airport in Indonesia. 15 people died and 43 survived, making it the second-worst accident involving an ATP. It was the first fatal incident involving the type within its first ten years of service.
* On 11 December 1999, SATA Air Açores Flight 530 crashed into a mountain on São Jorge Island in the Azores, Portugal during a short haul flight. All 35 passengers and crew on board died in the crash. The accident was the worst air accident involving the ATP. It was confirmed that the crew were disorientated in the midst of low clouds over São Jorge Island and made a controlled flight into terrain.

==Surviving aircraft==

As of January 2024, there are six retired airframes that are either preserved or re-purposed. These are as follows:

*G-11-068: This aircraft was never completed and its fuselage has remained at Glasgow Prestwick Airport since. It is now used as an airport fire training platform.

*G-11-071: This aircraft was also never completed and was used as a smoke training platform at Woodford Aerodrome. Following the site’s closure, it was re-located to nearby Manchester Airport where it is used for similar purposes.

*SE-MHF: This aircraft was partially dismantled in 2021 at Isle of Man Airport. It only consists of its fuselage and wings up to the engine mounts. It is used as an airport fire training platform.

*SE-LHX (displayed as G-MAUD): This aircraft is on display at the Manx Aviation and Military Museum, Isle of Man Airport. It has used various salvaged parts from other scrapped airframes and has been re-stored in an original Manx Airlines livery. It also now bears the registration G-MAUD, although the actual G-MAUD was scrapped. It is the only ATP on display in near-complete condition.

*PK-DGA: Partially scrapped, the fuselage is currently being used as a restaurant in East Java, Indonesia.

*SE-LPU: Partially preserved, used for airport fire training at Coventry Airport, UK.

<text>The Doctor of Social Work (DSW) is a professional doctorate in social work, it is the highest academic award available in the field of social work, and most offer advanced training in a professional area of practice including but not limited to; nonprofit organization, leadership development, and social justice. The DSW is distinct from the more traditional PhD, which is a more research-oriented degree for social workers who wish primarily to further their careers in academia or research settings. Although different schools vary in the extent to which they emphasize each, both DSW and PhD candidates in the field of social work gain experience in education, advanced practice, teaching, supervision, research, policy analysis, administration and/or program development. As with other doctorates, a holder of a DSW is referred to using the formal title of &#x27;doctor&#x27;.

Individuals who hold the Doctor of Social Work work in a variety of fields and disciplines that coincide with that of social work including social services, educational leadership, health care administration and nonprofit organization.

==History of the DSW degree==
Although the first doctoral degrees that were offered in the field of social work were that of PhD&#x27;s, in the late 1940s the Doctor of Social Work program emerged, with some of the earliest DSW degrees having been offered at University of Pennsylvania and Smith College. Some institutions that originally offered PhD programs in Social Work later converted to the DSW professional doctorate degree due to growing and improving trends in social work and in academia.

By the 1960s and 1970s, doctoral degrees for social work increased significantly. By the early 1970s, many universities began only offering the DSW professional doctorate, surpassing that of the PhD degree in social work that was originally offered at many competing institutions.

Over the years, great confusion lay between the PhD and the DSW with many holders of the DSW entering research based positions within higher education. Seeing that the DSW is a professional practice based doctorate, many institutions slowly began to remove the DSW from their curriculum in an effort to promote research education within the discipline.

With many social workers and allied health professionals pursuing clinical practice based doctoral degrees in other disciplines including education, nursing, psychology, physical therapy and nutrition, the discussion to promote the DSW degree was slowly placed at the forefront.

Understanding that not all practice based doctorates should be solely focused on advanced clinical practice, the DSW was emerged as an advanced practice professional doctorate.

Having been an advanced practice doctoral degree, the Doctor of Social Work is an important development in community based social services encompassing components in education, social justice, social welfare and policy development/analysis.

Holders of this degree are expected to work in a variety of fields and arenas in social service agencies, health and mental health care institutions, higher education and academia, and community service organizations.

==Time frame==

The typical time frame for completion of a Doctor of Social Work is 2 to 4 years after earning a master&#x27;s degree.

==Admission==

Admission to a Doctor of Social Work program in the USA is highly competitive. Typically, institutions require applicants to hold a master&#x27;s degree. Applicants may also hold a MSW degree from a Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) accredited program or a related degree including but not limited to Master of Public Administration (MPA), Master of Public Health (MPH), Master of Arts in Education (MAEd), Master of Science in Nursing (MSN), Master of Public Policy (MPP) and the Master of Business Administration (MBA).

<doc id="421782" wikidata="Q1341976" url="?curid=421782" title="World Idol">
<text>World Idol (Germany: SuperStar Weltweit, Arab World: SuperStar El Alaam) is a one-off international version of the singing competition television show &quot;Pop Idol&quot;, featuring winners of the various national &quot;Idol&quot; shows around the world competing against each other.

==Background==
The performance show was broadcast on Christmas Day 2003, with the results show aired on New Year&#x27;s Day 2004. It was produced in the United Kingdom at Fountain Studios in London, using the set from the recently completed second series of &quot;Pop Idol&quot;. After presenting the competitors, viewers from the 11 participating countries were allowed to vote by telephone, but not for the participant from their home country.

All participants sang in English except for Diana Karazon, who sang in Arabic.

British presenters Ant &amp; Dec hosted the show on most English speaking countries, while local presenters hosted for their own country in the local language. Additionally, Canada’s CTV Network used &quot;Canadian Idol&quot; host Ben Mulroney (with the show on Fox, which used Ant and Dec as hosts, was not simulcast with the CTV feed, to prevent Canadians from calling the American toll-free number to vote for their idol, Ryan Malcolm). Victoria Beckham performed her UK No. 3 hit &quot;Let Your Head Go&quot; during the results interval.

The show was broadcast on 11 television broadcasters worldwide.

==Broadcasters==
*Germany: RTL Television
*United Kingdom: ITV
*Norway: TV 2
*United States: Fox
*Canada: CTV
*Australia: Network Ten
*Belgium: vtm
*Poland: Polsat
*The Netherlands: RTL 4
*Arab States: Future TV
*South Africa: M-NET

==Results==
The points were awarded in a similar fashion as the Eurovision Song Contest, i.e. each country awarded a number of points from 1 to 10 to each other country, using each number once. The results were:

===Spokespersons===
Each country appointed a spokesperson (or a pair of spokespersons) to announce their respective country&#x27;s points.
* Ant &amp; Dec (United Kingdom)
* (Belgium)
* Andrew G and James Mathison (Australia)
* Ryan Seacrest (United States)
* Rania Kurdi and (Arab States)
* (Poland)
* Tooske Ragas (Netherlands)
* Ben Mulroney (Canada)
* Michelle Hunziker and (Germany)
* Thomas Numme and Harald Rønneberg (Norway)
* Marah Louw (South Africa)
==Scoreboard==
Each country&#x27;s Idol automatically gained the maximum 12 points. Therefore, the most points an Idol could gain from another country was 10.
===10 points===
Below is a summary of all 10 (max) points in the final:

==Judges==
The judges of the competition were:

* Randall Abrahams (South Africa)
* Simon Cowell (representing United States, also judge on original UK show)
* (Belgium)
* Ian &quot;Dicko&quot; Dickson (Australia)
* Shona Fraser (Germany)
* Jan Fredrik Karlsen (Norway)
* Elias Rahbani (Lebanon)
* (Netherlands)
* Pete Waterman (United Kingdom)
* Zack Werner (Canada)
* Kuba Wojewódzki (Poland)
==Reception==
Simon Cowell, who judged &quot;American Idol&quot; as well as the original &quot;Pop Idol&quot;, was very critical of the format. He went as far as to say he hated it, in that it made the winners from the ten other &quot;Idol&quot; competitions into losers. Cowell also thought many of the judges were trying to copy his abrasive style (most notably Canadian Idol judge Zack Werner). Television critics also panned the programme, particularly as the UK phone voting was profit-making, whereas tradition dictates that Christmas specials of such programmes donate profits to charity.

===Ratings===
In Canada, the special was watched by 1.9 million viewers. In Poland, &quot;World Idol&quot; was the highest-rated in its timeslot, 4.5 million viewers, and 28.6 share per cent. In the United States, &quot;World Idol&quot; was the number-one show of the night among adults from 18–34 but drew a disappointing 6.5 million viewers overall. In Australia, it was the highest-rated show of the night, it had about 2.4 million viewers. In the Netherlands, it was the No. 1 rated show in its timeslot. In the UK, over 4 million tuned in, but the show was beaten by other popular programs that aired Christmas night.

<text>The last period in Czechoslovak history began with the Velvet Revolution from 17 to 28 November 1989 that overthrew the communist government, and ended with the dissolution of Czechoslovakia on 1 January 1993.

== Velvet Revolution ==
===Background===

Although in March 1987 Gustáv Husák nominally committed Czechoslovakia to follow the program of &quot;perestroika&quot;, he nevertheless cautioned the party in October 1987 not to &quot;hasten solutions too quickly&quot; so as to &quot;minimize the risks that could occur.&quot; (1 December 1987)

On 17 December 1987 Husák resigned as head of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSC). He retained, however, his post of president of Czechoslovakia and his full membership on the Presidium of the KSC. Husák&#x27;s resignation was caused by failing health and by the increasing ambitions of the party members Miloš Jakeš, Ladislav Adamec, and Vasil Biľak which had been apparent since the spring of 1987. Miloš Jakeš, who replaced Husák as first secretary of the KSC, was sixty-five years of age at the time of his assumption of the most powerful post in the country. Other than the age difference and the fact that Jakeš was a Czech whereas Husák is a Slovak, there was little to distinguish the new leader from his predecessor. In his first pronouncements as the head of the KSC, Jakes assured the KSC&#x27;s Central Committee that he would continue the cautious and moderate path of reform set forth by Husák. He called for a large-scale introduction of new technology as the means to &quot;fundamentally increase the efficiency of the Czechoslovak economy.&quot;; However, he also warned that there would be no &quot;retreat from the fundamental principles of socialism,&quot; adding that the party had learned well the &quot;lesson from 1968-69 and know[s] where such a retreat leads.&quot; At the same time, Jakeš acknowledged Soviet pressure for reform by pledging to pursue economic restructuring, stating that &quot;just as Soviet Communists, we too must observe the principle that more democracy means more socialism.&quot; 

The Czechoslovak version of &quot;perestroika&quot;, which had slowly taken shape during the last months of Husák&#x27;s rule under the guidance of the reformist and pro-Mikhail Gorbachev Czechoslovak Premier Lubomír Štrougal, called for a modest decentralization of state economic administration but postponed any concrete action until the end of the decade. The slow pace of the Czechoslovak reform movement was an irritant to the Soviet leadership. Economically, however, it was surely partly because on the one hand there were no serious economic problems at the standard-of-living level in Czechoslovakia as opposed to e.g. Poland, the Soviet Union and Hungary, and on the other hand the catastrophic initial effects of the reforms in the Soviet Union and Hungary could already be seen in the late 1980s. A corroboration of this might be the fact that Gustáv Husák, before his resignation in 1989 (see Velvet Revolution), told to the newly appointed anti-Communist government they could expect very difficult years to come. The dissatisfaction of many ordinary Czechs and Slovaks was increasing, due to the rigid political situation and lack of freedom, but mainly because they could view foreign TV channels in some regions (West German in frontier Bohemia, Austrian in southwestern Slovakia (including the capital Bratislava)), and due to the gradual spread of VCRs in the late 1980s, the way of living in Western Europe and in the USA. 

In December 1987, some 500,000 Catholics in Czechoslovakia signed a petition for religious freedom. It was the biggest petition of that sort in central Europe. 

The first anti-Communist demonstration took place on 25 March 1988 – the Candle demonstration. An unauthorized peaceful gathering of some 2,000 (other sources 10,000) Catholics in the Slovak capital Bratislava, organized by the Slovak Catholic dissenters and demanding religious freedom and civic rights, was violently dispersed by the police force. Some 100 participants were arrested. Leading Communist functionaries (e.g., the Slovak prime minister, minister of the interior, minister of culture) observed the whole operation from the windows of the nearby hotel Carlton. 

Demonstrations also occurred on 28 October 1988 (the anniversary of the establishment of Czechoslovakia in 1918) in Prague, Bratislava and some other towns. The establishment of &quot;capitalist&quot; Czechoslovakia on 28 October only became a public holiday in September 1988 in the Communist Czechoslovakia. Further demonstrations followed in January 1989 (commenorating the 20th anniversary of the death of Jan Palach on 16 January 1969), on 21 August 1989 (the 21st anniversary of the Soviet military intervention in 1968) and on 28 October 1989 (see above).

===The Revolution===
The anti-Communist revolution started on 16 November 1989 in Bratislava, with a demonstration of Slovak university students for democracy, and continued with the well-known similar demonstration of Czech students in Prague on 17 November. The entire Politburo, including Jakeš, resigned on 24 November. Five days later, the Federal Assembly deleted the provisions of the Constitution enshrining the Communist Party&#x27;s &quot;leading role.&quot;

== Following the Velvet Revolution ==

In December 1989, Husák, who had remained president after giving up leadership of the party, swore in a coalition government in which Communists had a minority of ministerial positions even though it was headed by a Communist. He resigned shortly after presiding over the formal end of the regime he had largely created.

The first free elections in Czechoslovakia since 1946 took place in June 1990 without incident and with more than 95% of the population voting. As anticipated, Civic Forum and Public Against Violence won landslide victories in their respective republics and gained a comfortable majority in the federal parliament. The parliament undertook substantial steps toward securing the democratic evolution of Czechoslovakia. It successfully moved toward fair local elections in November 1990, ensuring fundamental change at the county and town level.

Civic Forum found, however, that although it had successfully completed its primary objective—the overthrow of the communist regime—it was ineffectual as a governing party. The demise of Civic Forum was viewed by most as necessary and inevitable.

By the end of 1990, unofficial parliamentary &quot;clubs&quot; had evolved with distinct political agendas. Most influential was the Civic Democratic Party, headed by Václav Klaus. Other notable parties that came into being after the split were the Czech Social Democratic Party, Civic Movement, and Civic Democratic Alliance.

== Dissolution of Czechoslovakia ==

On 25 November 1992 Czechoslovakia&#x27;s parliament (the Federal Assembly) voted to split the country into the Czech Republic and Slovakia starting on 1 January 1993.

<doc id="421794" wikidata="Q1992451" url="?curid=421794" title="Balaur">
<text>A balaur (pl. balauri) in Romanian folklore is a type of many-headed dragon or monstrous serpent, sometimes said to be equipped with wings. The number of heads is usually around three, but they can also have seven heads or even twelve heads according to some legends.

The balaur in folktale is typically evil, demanding or abducting young maidens or the princess, and defeated by the hero such as Saint George or the fair youth Făt-Frumos.

There is some lore in which the balaur is considered weather-making, and living in an airborne state, but these types of balaur are sometimes interchangeably called &quot;hala&quot; or &quot;ala&quot;, being confounded with the pan-Slavic air and water demon. The balaur (instead of the zmeu) is the vehicle of the weather-controlling Solomonari according to some sources.

There are also legends about the balaur in which they can produce precious stones from their saliva. Also, it is said that whoever manages to slay it will be forgiven a sin.

== General description ==

In the Romanian language, balauri are &quot;monstrous serpents&quot; or dragons. Alternatively, the word balaur can be used to describe any monster like creature. They are many-headed like the Greek hell-hound Cerberus or the hydra and are winged and golden, according to Lazăr Șăineanu.

As reported by journalist Eustace Clare Grenville Murray, in Romanian folklore the &quot;balaur&quot; or &quot;balaurul&quot; is a serpentine being who guards treasures and princesses, coming to blows against heroic Fêt-Frumos.

The balaur recurs in Romanian folktales as a ravenous dragon that preys upon maidens only to be defeated by the hero Făt-Frumos (&quot;Handsome Lad&quot;). The balaur may also be the abductor of the princess Ileana Cosânzeana, although according to Șăineanu the kidnapper of this princess is a &quot;zmeu&quot; in the form of giant with pebbly tails (or scaly tails). It is noted that the balaur and the zmeu are often confounded with each other.

According to folklorist Tudor Pamfile, there are three types of balauri in folk tradition: water-, land-, and air-dwelling. A type of balaur of the first type is a seven-headed monster that dwells in the well of a village, demanding maidens as sacrifice until defeated by either the hero named Busuioc or by Saint George.

The second type of balaur, according to Pamfile, is said to dwell in the &quot;Armenian land&quot; () where they produce precious stones. In Wallachia, it is also believed that the saliva of a balaur can form precious stones, according to American writer Cora Linn Daniels. Romanian scholar Mircea Eliade noted that the notion a precious stones are formed from a snake&#x27;s spittle is widespread, from England to China.

The balaur is often associated with the weather and is alternatively called &quot;hala&quot; or &quot;ala&quot;, which is usually a Slavic term for a weather demon. This is the type Pamfile calls the &quot;third type&quot; that is air-dwelling. When two balauri meet and fight in the air, there ensues various meteorological damages such as uprooting of trees, or objects being tossed about. Another tradition is that the balaur uses the rainbow as its path and sucks moisture from any spot in order to cause rain. There is also lore about the balaur which is said to be quite similar to the Bulgarian Banat lore about the &quot;lamia&quot; (locally called &quot;lam&#x27;a&quot;), which states that the &quot;lam&#x27;a&quot; draw water from the sea to fill the cloud.

Although the dragons ridden by the Solomonari are often said to be &quot;zmei&quot; (sing. &quot;zmeu&quot;), they were &quot;balauri&quot; according to some sources. A balaur was controlled by these weather-controlling sorcerers using &quot;a golden rein&quot; (or golden bridle; ). The dragons were usually kept hidden in the depths of a lake, until summoned by their riders.

== Name == 
=== In Eastern Romance ===

The word is attested in Daco-Romanian and Aromanian. In Romanian language the word appears with variations: &quot;balaoană&quot;, &quot;bălăuraş&quot;, &quot;bălăurel&quot;, &quot;balaurel&quot;, &quot;bălăuroaică&quot;, &quot;bălăuaua&quot;, and possibly in the shorter form &quot;bală&quot;. Similar words are attested in Megleno-Romanian, e.g., &quot;bular&quot; &#x27;a type of large snake&#x27; and &quot;bălăura&quot; &#x27;large (about plums)&#x27;, and in Aromanian &quot;bularu&quot; &#x27;red snake&#x27;.

=== Slavic comparanda ===
According to Ranko Matasovic, the word appears along the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea. In this regard, Croatian linguist Peter Skok located the following variations of the lexeme:

* &quot;blavor&quot; (Montenegro and Dalmatia); &quot;blavorak&quot; (diminutive, attested in a 16th century writer from Ragusa); &quot;blavūr&quot; (Ragusa); &quot;blavòruša&quot; (aumentative; Montenegro)
* &quot;bläor&quot; (Imotski, Podlug in Cattaro, Benkovac, Jagodnja, Sibenik - all in Dalmatia); &quot;blőr&quot;; &quot;blőruša&quot; (Montenegro)
* &quot;blaur&quot; (Dalmatia), &quot;blavorina&quot; (aumentative, Koprivno in Sinj, Dalm.), &quot;blaorina&quot; (Ervenik, Dalm.)
* &quot;blahor&quot; (Nevesinje in Herzegovina)
* &quot;blabor&quot; (Tribanj, Dalm.), &quot;blaborina&quot; (aumentative)

The Serbo-Croatian &quot;blavor&quot;/&quot;blaor&quot;/&quot;blavur&quot; (&quot;European legless lizard&quot;) is cognate with &quot;balaur&quot;, and is regarded as one of the few pre-Slavic Balkan relict words in Serbo-Croatian. The word is, however, unattested in Bulgarian, per Skok and Matasovic.

=== Etymology ===
The term &quot;Balaur&quot; (Aromanian &quot;bul&#x27;ar&quot;) is of unknown etymology. It has been linked with Albanian &quot;boljë&quot;/&quot;bollë&quot; (&quot;snake&quot;) and &quot;buljar&quot; (&quot;water snake&quot;). The Transylvanian Saxon &quot;balaur&quot; &quot;dragon&quot;, and &quot;balaura&quot;, an insult term in Serbia, are borrowed from Romanian.

The Albanian and Romanian terms possibly stem from the same Thracian root, &quot;*bell-&quot; or &quot;*ber-&quot; &quot;beast, monster&quot;, the traces of which can also be found in the name of the Greek mythological hero Bellerophon (&quot;the beast killer&quot;). Skok traces its appearance in Slavic to a possible &quot;Illyrio-Thracian&quot; word &quot;*bolauras&quot; &gt; &quot;blavor&quot;. However, Matasovic discards a Thracian source and considers the word to be ultimately of Illyrian origin, with the form &quot;*bulauras&quot;, leading to an ancient Slavic borrowing with the form &quot;*bъla(v)ur&quot;.

== Legacy ==
=== Sciences ===
The maniraptor theropod &quot;Balaur bondoc&quot; is named after this creature.

=== Popular culture ===
==== Video games ====
* In the MMORPG &quot;&quot;, the Dragons that once ruled the world and are the enemy are called the Balaur.
* In the MMORPG &quot;Star Trek Online&quot; the largest class of Gorn warship is the Balaur Dreadnought.
* In &quot;Ace Combat: Joint Assault&quot;, there is a gigantic railgun weapon named the Balaur.

==== Television series ====
In the 2020 TV series &quot;Dracula&quot;, the Count uses the alias &quot;Mr. Balaur&quot;.

To burn an optical disc, one usually first creates an optical disc image with a full file system, of a type designed for the optical disc, in temporary storage such as a file in another file system on a disk drive. One may test the image on target devices using rewriteable media such as CD-RW, DVD±RW and BD-RE. Then, one copies the image to the disc (usually write-once media for hard distribution).

Most optical disc authoring utilities create a disc image and copy it to the disc in one bundled operation, so that end-users often do not know the distinction between creating and burning. However, it is useful to know because creating the disc image is a time-consuming process, while copying the image is much faster. Most disc burning applications silently delete the image from the Temporary folder after making one copy. If users override this default, telling the application to preserve the image, they can reuse the image to create more copies. Otherwise, they must rebuild the image each time they want a copy.

Some packet-writing applications do not require writing the entire disc at once, but allow writing of different parts at different times. This allows a user to construct a disc incrementally, as it could be on a rewritable medium like a floppy disk or rewritable CD. However, if the disc is non-rewritable, a given bit can be written only once. Due to this limitation, a non-rewritable disc whose burn failed for any reason cannot be repaired. (Such a disc is colloquially termed a &quot;coaster&quot;, a reference to a beverage coaster.)

There are many optical disc authoring technologies for optimizing the authoring process and preventing errors. Some programs can mount a disc image as a file system type, so these images appear as mounted discs. The disc image can then be tested after it is assembled but before writing to a physical disc.

==Sessions==
DVD and Blu-ray (sequential) discs also allow the use of multiple sessions.

===Tracks===

Tracks contain the information to be stored on the disc. A track is a consecutive set of sectors on the disc containing a block of data. One session may contain one or more tracks of the same or different types. Tracks can be audio information or data, which use the same format, or video information. Data can include album information and low-resolution graphics such as karaoke lyrics; however, these tracks are not compliant with the Red Book of CD audio standards.

==Hardware==

Authoring is commonly done in software on computers with optical disc recorders. There are, however, stand-alone devices like personal video recorders which can also author and record discs.

==Software==
Use of optical disc recorders require &quot;optical disc authoring software&quot;, sometimes called &quot;burning applications&quot; or &quot;burner applications&quot;. Such software is usually sold with the recorder. Some operating systems come bundled with them.

Creating an optical disc usually involves first creating an optical disc image with a full file system designed for the optical disc, and then actually burning the image to the disc. Many programs create the disc image and burn in one bundled application (Quick Copy or Copy On-the-fly), such that end-users do not even know the distinction.

Disc file systems include ISO 9660 (often known simply as “ISO”) and Universal Disk Format (UDF). ISO is most common for CDs and UDF is most common for DVDs.

There are also packet writing applications that do not require writing the entire disc at once, but allow writing parts at a time, allowing the disc to be used as a random access removable medium (somewhat like a very large floppy, though with unique constraints).

Sometimes, disc images are made to make the authoring process more straightforward. Sometimes disc images are even used to emulate the presence of a CD-ROM or DVD drive with the data entirely resident on the hard disc.

For the command-line tool &quot;cdrdao&quot;, a so-called &quot;TOC file&quot; that can be authored inside a text editor is used to specify the details of the desired disc record.

==File systems==
Optical disc file system types include ISO 9660 (often known simply as &quot;ISO&quot;) and Universal Disk Format (UDF). ISO is most common for CDs and UDF is most common for DVDs and BDs.

===ISO 9660===

ISO 9660 is a format mainly used on CDs. The ISO 9660 can be extended with El Torito, Joliet, Rock Ridge, or the Apple ISO 9660 Extensions.

El Torito makes it possible to boot from a CD. The Joliet extension by Microsoft makes it possible to have long file names encoded in UCS-2, among other things. Rock Ridge is a system providing file-ownership, fewer restrictions on the file names, and more. Amiga extensions allow use of Amiga-specific attribute bits and comments. The Apple Extensions enables Macintosh-specific creator codes, file type, and so on.

===Universal Disk Format===

Universal Disk Format (UDF) is a newer filesystem that comes with additional features such as Unicode support, packet writing (UDF 1.50), and defect management on rewritable formats. Packet writing can alternatively be implemented with UDF 1.02 and Mount Rainier extensions. It allows one to use the disc like a floppy disk, that is to easily delete, create, and modify files, without having to write the whole disc again.

DVD-Video uses UDF 1.02, however Blu-Ray Disc uses UDF 2.50.

===HighMAT===
A compatibility technology called HighMAT allows visual material on the disc to be recognised, interpreted and supported by electronic play devices more efficiently.

<text>Guillermo Lora (Uncia, Potosi, 31 October 1922 – La Paz, 17 May 2009) was a Trotskyist leader in Bolivia who was active in the Revolutionary Workers&#x27; Party (POR) from the early 1940s and was its best known leader.

Lora became active in the POR when it was in the process of building links with the Bolivian labor movement, most notably the Federation of Bolivian Mine Workers (FSTMB). Following the POR&#x27;s participation in the 1952 &quot;Bolivian National Revolution&quot;, its power was quickly circumscribed by the ruling Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR). In the 1960s, when a faction of the POR sought to follow the example of Che Guevara and engage in guerrilla warfare, Lora led a second group, generally referred to as &#x27;POR(Masas)&#x27;, that maintained its focus on the labor movement. Though Lora sympathized with the International Committee of the Fourth International, his faction of the POR did not affiliate with any international socialist grouping during the time. In 1988, POR(Masas) founded the Liaison Committee for the Reconstruction of the Fourth International (CERCI).

During the years of military dictatorship in Bolivia in the 1970s, Lora and his faction of the POR were an important ally of Juan Lechín Oquendo (the president of the miners&#x27; union). Though it is far smaller than at its height in 1952, Lora&#x27;s POR still remains as one of the largest Trotskyist groups in Bolivia.

<text>Făt-Frumos (from Romanian &quot;făt&quot;: son, infant; &quot;frumos&quot;: handsome) is a knight hero in Romanian folklore.

Făt-Frumos has to go through tests and obstacles that surpass ordinary men&#x27;s power. With dignity, he always brings these to a positive resolution. He fights demonic monsters and malevolent characters (&quot;zmeu&quot;, &quot;balaur&quot;, &quot;Muma Pădurii&quot;, etc.). He travels in both &quot;this land&quot; and &quot;the other land&quot; (&quot;tarâmul celălalt&quot;) on the &quot;Calul Năzdrăvan&quot; (&quot;The Marvellous Horse&quot;), who also serves as his counsellor.

Akin to Prince Charming, he possesses such essential attributes as courage, purity, justness, physical and spiritual strength, cleverness, passion, and unshakable love. Făt-Frumos also displays some minimal abilities in performing miracles, as well as total commitment to a task once his word is given and to the monarch he serves. In some tales, he is so precocious as to be able to weep before he is born. Făt-Frumos is usually the youngest son of a king. In the Romanian folk stories it is common that all the sons of a king try to defeat the &quot;Zmeu&quot; or the &quot;Balaur&quot;, the older sons failing before the younger one succeeds.

At the end of the fairy tale, Făt-Frumos is paired up with the heroine of the story, a fairy maiden: Ileana Cosânzeana, Zâna Zânelor (Fairy Queen) or Doamna Chiralina.

In his journeys, Făt-Frumos often has to overcome a major dilemma related to the correct route he is to follow, and is bound to decide between two equally nonsensical choices. Asked about the right way, an old woman gives Făt-Frumos an obscure answer: &quot;If you turn right, you will be in sorrow; if you turn left, you will be in sorrow as well&quot;.

According to Victor Kernbach, this lose-lose situation evokes the historical condition of the Romanian people whose homeland had been constantly crossed and attacked by foreign powers, as the native population was always forced to decide between two equally unfortunate choices: ally with your enemies or fight them.

Făt-Frumos is also a commonplace figure of the Romanian culture and literature. He appears as a character in stories and poems by famous writers, such as Mihai Eminescu, Tudor Arghezi, or Nichita Stănescu. As a symptom of the Romanian people&#x27;s self-irony, Făt-Frumos can be encountered even in contemporary Romanian jokes, yet less frequently than Bulă or the political personalities of the moment.

<text>4AD is a British record label owned by Beggars Group. It was founded in London under the name Axis Records by Ivo Watts-Russell and Peter Kent in 1980 as an imprint of Beggars Banquet Records. The name was changed to 4AD after the release of the label&#x27;s first four singles. Later that year, Watts-Russell and Kent purchased the label from Beggars Banquet to become an independent record label, and Kent sold his share to Watts-Russell a year later.

The label gained prominence in the 1980s for releasing albums from alternative rock, post-punk, gothic rock, and dream pop artists, such as Bauhaus, Cocteau Twins, Modern English, Dead Can Dance, Clan of Xymox, Pixies, Throwing Muses, and Watts-Russell&#x27;s own musical project This Mortal Coil. In 1987, the label scored an international hit with the dance music single &quot;Pump Up the Volume&quot; by the one-off project MARRS. 4AD continued to have success in the 1990s and 2000s, with releases from the Breeders, Lush, Belly, Red House Painters, Camera Obscura, TV on the Radio, St. Vincent, and Bon Iver. , the label&#x27;s current roster includes acts such as Dry Cleaning, the National, Daughter, Deerhunter, Big Thief, Aldous Harding, U.S. Girls, Erika de Casier, and Future Islands.

In 1999, Watts-Russell sold 4AD back to the Beggars Group. The label&#x27;s history was detailed by Martin Aston in the book &quot;Facing The Other Way&quot;, released in 2013.

== History ==
Ivo Watts-Russell and Peter Kent, employees of the Beggars Banquet record store and label, founded Axis Records (named after ) in late 1979 as a property of Beggars Banquet, that was run by the two of them. After the first four Axis singles in early 1980, it became apparent that the name Axis was already being used by another music company and the name was changed to 4AD, an abbreviation of the word forward. Other names which they had considered included 1980AD, 4WD and 1984.

An initial idea for the label was that it would be a &quot;testing ground&quot; for Beggars Banquet; successful acts would graduate up to Beggars Banquet after a year at 4AD. The only band to follow this path would be Bauhaus, who were signed to Beggars Banquet in late 1980, before Watts-Russell and Kent purchased the label outright.

The two were the sole owners for about a year. Kent sold his share to Watts-Russell at the end of 1981, and started a new Beggars Banquet subsidiary, Situation Two Records. Watts-Russell would maintain ownership of the label, and act as its president, until the late 1990s.

Watts-Russell invited the graphic designer Vaughan Oliver and the photographer Nigel Grierson to create sleeve art for the label, and as a result, 4AD acquired a visually distinctive identity. Its artists, such as Cocteau Twins and Dead Can Dance, developed cult followings in the mid-1980s, but 4AD continued to evolve, and, after signing Throwing Muses and Pixies, the label increasingly concentrated on underground American rock music. In 1983, 4AD had a minor hit in America with the Modern English single &quot;I Melt With You&quot;. In 1987, 4AD had a UK number-one hit with the collaged &quot;Pump up the Volume&quot; by MARRS (licensed to 4th &amp; B&#x27;Way/Island Records in the US).

In the 1990s, 4AD established an office in Los Angeles and had success with bands such as The Breeders, Belly, Red House Painters, Unrest and His Name Is Alive, as well as solo material by Frank Black and Kristin Hersh.

The label&#x27;s deal with Warner Bros. Records in the United States in 1992 would start the beginning of a new phase in 4AD history. New signings that year included American underground acts Kendra Smith, Tarnation, Air Miami and The Amps. The following year Watts-Russell started a sub-label, Guernica, which would release records by Unrest, That Dog, and Bettie Serveert.

In 1999, Watts-Russell sold his share in 4AD back to the Beggars Group (as it had by then become), but the label continued to release music and add new artists to its roster. Simon Halliday took control of the label at the end of 2007. Immediate successes were Bon Iver&#x27;s critically lauded debut &quot;For Emma, Forever Ago&quot; (CAD 2809) and &quot;Dear Science&quot; by Brooklyn&#x27;s TV on the Radio (CAD 2821). In 2008, the Beggars Group re-aligned itself so that several labels, including Beggars Banquet itself, were folded up on to the 4AD label. Bands including The National were moved to 4AD as a part of this merger. In 2009, the label released, amongst others, St. Vincent&#x27;s second record &quot;Actor&quot; (CAD 2919) and Camera Obscura&#x27;s &quot;My Maudlin Career.&quot; The following year, 4AD saw the release of The National&#x27;s &quot;High Violet&quot; and acclaimed albums from Ariel Pink&#x27;s Haunted Graffiti, Blonde Redhead and Deerhunter.

In the next three years, 4AD oversaw new releases from Scott Walker, Bon Iver, Iron &amp; Wine, and Tune-Yards, whilst also expanded its roster with a number of beats and electronic acts in the shape of acts including Purity Ring and Grimes, with the latter releasing one of the best received albums of 2012. Additional signings to the label include bEEdEEgEE, of Gang Gang Dance, Lo-Fang, and British producer SOHN. At the start of 2014, the label also announced the additions of Future Islands and Merchandise, followed by D.D Dumbo.

In 2015, the label released critically lauded albums by Deerhunter and Grimes, amongst others. The following year, the label and The National landed their first UK No. 1 record with &quot;Sleep Well Beast&quot;. Latest signings to the roster include Aldous Harding and British band Dry Cleaning.

In April 2021, the label released &quot;Bills &amp; Aches &amp; Blues&quot;, a compilation album featuring bands from 4AD covering songs the label had released over its 40 years.

== Distribution ==

While 4AD did not handle any distribution outside the United Kingdom for many years, it had many willing distributors in many countries; Virgin Records for France, Nippon Columbia distributed much of the label in Japan, while PolyGram subsidiary Vertigo Records released many of the label&#x27;s records in Canada. The USA had always been a tough market for 4AD, even though its records sold well there as imports. Only a few of the label&#x27;s acts had deals to license their recordings in the US, among various labels.

In 1992, Watts-Russell signed a five-year distribution deal with Warner Bros. Records so that nearly all 4AD releases would be released in the United States. When the deal ended, he offered to sell the label back to Beggars Banquet. Dead Can Dance&#x27;s output, however, stayed with Warner Bros. until the sale back to Beggars Group.

The deal with Beggars Banquet was completed by early 1999, and since then it has owned 4AD and its distribution worldwide. This led to many negotiations for the label&#x27;s back catalogue, like getting back American distribution rights for Pixies, Dead Can Dance and Cocteau Twins.

== Releases ==
== Catalogue numbering scheme ==

In 2013, the music historian Martin Aston wrote in &quot;Facing the Other Way: The Story of 4AD&quot;:
For the most part, 4AD&#x27;s official UK releases follow a standard scheme for designating catalogue numbers. Although there have been some variations over the years, some general rules can be devised to easily determine the format (LP, CD, etc.) and year of release by looking at a 4AD catalog number.

=== Prefix ===
The first part of a catalogue number is a prefix that contains a variation of &quot;AD,&quot; based on the 4AD name. Some standards are:
* AD = single
* BAD = EP
* CAD = full-length LP
* DAD = double LP
* MAD = mini-LP

Special editions of releases had an extra &quot;D&quot; added to the prefix:
* CAD D = special edition of a full-length LP
* DAD D = special edition of a double LP

Some other &quot;AD&quot; variations have been used less frequently over the years, including (but not limited to):
* EAD = electronic download
* GAD = reissue (usually mid-priced)
* HAD = remastered or significantly altered reissue (usually with some combination of bonus tracks, re-mastering, or new artwork)
* JAD and MAD = &quot;mini album&quot; that is longer than an EP but shorter than an LP
* SAD = Super Audio CD release (as in the Dead Can Dance 2008 remastered reissues)
* TAD = temporary/limited release

4AD only released one LP on DAT format, Cocteau Twins&#x27; &quot;Blue Bell Knoll&quot;, which was designated CADT 807.

=== Numerical designation ===
The second part of the catalogue number is a number that represents the year of release (via the number of years since 1980, following the &#x27;1980 Forward&#x27; theme), and the order of release in the particular year. For example, This Mortal Coil&#x27;s LP &quot;It&#x27;ll End in Tears&quot; is CAD 411. The &quot;CAD&quot; represents that the release is an LP, the &quot;4&quot; in 411 represents 1984, and 11 marks the 11th release of that year. This is the vinyl LP release; cassette versions have &quot;C&quot; added to the prefix (CADC 411 in this example); CD versions have &quot;CD&quot; added at the end (CAD 411CD).

A side effect of this scheme is that it made it seem like 4AD had hundreds of releases early on. In the 1990s, 4AD changed the first part of the number from &quot;100s&quot; to &quot;1000s,&quot; temporarily making the number not correspond with the number of years since 1980. Releases in 1990 used &quot;00&quot; directly after the prefix (e.g., the Pixies&#x27; &quot;Bossanova&quot;, CAD0010, released in the fall of 1990); 1991 used &quot;10&quot; directly after the prefix (e.g., This Mortal Coil&#x27;s &quot;Blood&quot;, DAD 1005, released early in 1991), 1992 used &quot;20,&quot; and so on for the rest of the 1990s.

Wanting to return to numbering with the years since 1980, 4AD had to provide a workaround for releases in the year 2000. Since the &quot;20&quot; numerical designation had been used in 1992, all releases in 2000 used &quot;2K&quot; (e.g., Mojave 3&#x27;s &quot;Excuses for Travellers&quot;, CAD 2K05, released in early 2000). Between 2001 and 2009, the catalogue numbering scheme returned to the original format, with the first two digits of the number representing the years since 1980 (e.g., Blonde Redhead&#x27;s &quot;23&quot;, CAD 2717, released in 2007; the 27th year since 1980). Things have not been too consistent since, and there have been several gaps. 2010 releases feature the numerical designation 3X, as &quot;30&quot; had already been used in 1993. This process appears to have come to an end with the few &quot;x&quot;AD37&quot;nn&quot; releases of the early months of 2017. The catalogue numbers of all releases since April 2017 (beginning with &quot;The Far Field&quot; by Future Islands, 4AD0001CD/4AD0001LP) have begun with 4AD00&quot;nn&quot; and ended with letters indicating the release format. No indication of release year is given.

== 4AD Sessions ==
The 4AD Sessions are an ongoing series of video recordings with various acts from the label&#x27;s roster. Following on from the Deerhunter session at the Studio Plateaux on Platts Eyott island in 2008, the recordings see 4AD artists performing back-catalogue covers and alternative versions of their own material. They are housed on the label&#x27;s website.

<text>Colourbox were an English electronic musical group on the 4AD label, releasing a number of records between 1982 and 1987. The band was formed by brothers Martyn and Steve Young, Ian Robbins, and vocalist Debbion Currie. Currie and Robbins left the band in 1983, and Lorita Grahame joined as singer.

Colourbox stood apart from their then-4AD labelmates – bands such as Dead Can Dance, Cocteau Twins, and This Mortal Coil (although the Young brothers contributed to tracks on the latter project&#x27;s first two albums &quot;It&#x27;ll End in Tears&quot; and &quot;Filigree &amp; Shadow&quot;). Their sound was eclectic, drawing from reggae and soul influences (with covers of tracks by U-Roy and Augustus Pablo released as singles), beat-box driven hip-hop rhythms, blue-eyed soul, as well as a fusion of far-ranging influences spanning from classic R&amp;B, to dub and industrial.

Following their debut single &quot;Breakdown&quot; / &quot;Tarantula&quot; in late 1982 (and a 1983 reworking of the tracks by new producer Mick Glossop, still featuring Currie on vocals), Currie was replaced by Lorita Grahame. A four-track mini-album simply titled &quot;Colourbox&quot; was released in November 1983, displaying the band&#x27;s fledgling experimental sound. After a handful of singles, Colourbox&#x27;s first full-length studio album — also self-titled — followed in August 1985, which further refined the band&#x27;s diverse palette, mixing sample-splattered power-punk instrumentals with elegiac piano pieces (&quot;Just Give &#x27;em Whiskey&quot; and &quot;Sleepwalker&quot; respectively), commercial pop (&quot;The Moon Is Blue&quot; and &quot;Suspicion&quot;) and more reggae and soul covers (U-Roy&#x27;s &quot;Say You&quot; and The Supremes&#x27; &quot;You Keep Me Hanging On&quot;). It was to remain the band&#x27;s only full-length album.

In 1986, the band issued two completely different singles simultaneously on the same day. One was an instrumental initially intended as a FIFA World Cup anthem of that year (&quot;The Official Colourbox World Cup Theme&quot;). The other, a cover of Jacob Miller&#x27;s &quot;Baby I Love You So&quot;, featured Lorita Grahame on vocals. The same year, 4AD issued the 1983 mini-LP on CD for the first time, with the 12&quot; versions of both of these singles added, along with the B-side &quot;Looks Like We&#x27;re Shy One Horse / Shoot Out&quot; and the previous non-album single &quot;Breakdown&quot;.

&quot;Baby I Love You So&quot; was ranked number 12 by &quot;New Musical Express&quot; on their critics&#x27; list of the best singles of 1986.

The band had an international hit in 1987 with &quot;Pump Up the Volume&quot;, a collaboration with A.R. Kane under the name MARRS. The song was notable for being constructed almost entirely from samples of other records, a novelty for a popular record at that time, though Colourbox themselves had been using sampling extensively since their 1983 mini-album. The pressures of sudden success and the long-running litigation caused by the use of samples resulted in the band never recording as Colourbox again.

==Post-breakup==
For a brief time following Colourbox&#x27;s dissolution, Martyn Young served as a producer on records by acts as diverse as The Christians and fellow labelmates The Wolfgang Press, whilst former singer Lorita Grahame lent her vocals to a record released by short-lived One Little Indian act Hit the Roof (on a cover of Edwin Starr&#x27;s &quot;Contact&quot;). Since then, little has been heard from any of the group members, save for a brief return to promotional duties for Martyn Young in 2001, to oversee the release of the Colourbox compilation &quot;Best of Colourbox 82/87&quot;.

4AD released a self-titled box set of four compact discs, compiling all of their catalogue (the full-length album with its companion remix album in full, a 7&quot; mix CD, a 12&quot; mix CD, and the first EP with two BBC Radio sessions and a previously unreleased mix of &quot;Arena&quot;) on 21 May 2012. The collection, marking the 30th anniversary of the group, was sequenced by Martyn Young.

In 2014, Colourbox were the subject of an exhibition, &quot;Music of the Band (1982 - 1987)&quot;, curated by Wolfgang Tillmans at his Between Bridges gallery in Berlin. A CD compilation of 16 tracks selected by Tillmans was released by 4AD to tie in with the exhibition. The collection was reissued in 2017, with the addition of a double LP edition, in conjunction with Tillmans&#x27; exhibit at the Tate Modern in London.

Martyn Young has been playing additional keyboards, recording, producing and mixing the new Modern English album, which was originally due for release in March 2016. Ian Robbins died in 2014. Steven Young died on 13 July 2016.

<doc id="421807" wikidata="Q5141332" url="?curid=421807" title="Cohen v. California">
<text>Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15 (1971), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court holding that the First Amendment prevented the conviction of Paul Robert Cohen for the crime of disturbing the peace by wearing a jacket displaying &quot;Fuck the Draft&quot; in the public corridors of a California courthouse.

The Court ultimately found that displaying a mere four-letter word was not sufficient justification for allowing states to restrict free speech and that free speech can be restricted only under severe circumstances beyond offensiveness. The ruling set a precedent used in future cases concerning the power of states to regulate free speech in order to maintain public civility.

The Court describes free expression as a &quot;powerful medicine&quot; in such pluralistic society like the United States. It is intended to &quot;remove government restraints&quot; from public discussion to &quot;produce a more capable citizenry&quot; and preserve individual choices which is an imperative for &quot;our political system.&quot;

==Background==
===Facts of the case===
On April 26, 1968, 19-year-old Paul Robert Cohen was arrested for wearing a jacket bearing the words &quot;Fuck the Draft&quot; in a corridor of the Los Angeles Hall of Justice. Cohen was reportedly at court to testify as a defense witness in an unrelated hearing, and had removed his jacket on entering the courtroom.

An officer who had noticed his jacket in the corridor requested that the judge hold Cohen in contempt of court, but the judge did not take any action. The officer then waited until Cohen exited the courtroom and arrested him for disturbing the peace. Cohen claimed that he wore the jacket in an act of protest against the Vietnam War, to inform others of the depth of the feelings. He was convicted of violating section 415 of the California Penal Code, which prohibited &quot;maliciously and willfully disturb[ing] the peace or quiet of any neighborhood or person [by] tumultuous or offensive conduct&quot;, and sentenced to 30 days in jail.

===Lower courts===
Cohen appealed the conviction to the Appellate Department of the Superior Court, which in a memorandum opinion ruled that &quot;conduct that is merely offensive is insufficient&quot;. The State then requested a rehearing, and the Superior Court then added, in a more lengthy opinion, that according to the California Penal Code, offensive conduct must also be tumultuous. The state then appealed to the California Court of Appeal, which upheld the conviction with the claim that &quot;offensive conduct&quot; means &quot;behavior which has a tendency to provoke others to acts of violence or to in turn disturb the peace&quot;.

According to the ruling, Cohen had &quot;carefully chose[n] the forum for his views where his conduct would have an effective shock value&quot; and that he should have known that the words on his jacket could have resulted in violent reactions. The California Court of Appeal also stated that Cohen used words that were below the &quot;minimum standard of propriety and the accepted norm of public behavior&quot;. The opinion stated that California could determine what language was not suitable for use in public, an expansion of First Amendment jurisprudence. After the California Supreme Court denied review, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a writ of certiorari on June 22, 1970.

==Supreme Court==
===Arguments===
The case was argued by Melville Nimmer, representing Paul Robert Cohen, and Michael T. Sauer, representing California. Anthony G. Amsterdam filed an &quot;amicus curiae&quot; brief for the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California, in support of Cohen. At the beginning of oral argument, Chief Justice Warren Burger advised Nimmer that it would not be necessary to &quot;dwell on the facts&quot;, effectively stating that Nimmer should not state the word on the jacket. Seconds later, Nimmer did exactly that, stating that &quot;What this young man did was to walk through a courthouse corridor wearing a jacket on which were inscribed the words, &#x27;Fuck the Draft.&#x27;&quot; Nimmer believed that if he did not say the word, it would concede that there are some places that certain words cannot be uttered and the case would be lost. Nimmer also distinguished what Cohen did from contempt of court, emphasizing that Cohen did not display the jacket in a courtroom while a court was in session.

Sauer&#x27;s argument was that the conviction should stand as is, that the very words were offensive conduct by themselves, even when there was no objection by anyone present. Sauer also argued that the violation consisted of both speech and conduct, and that the conduct was not protected speech. Sauer noted that the statute read that it was an offense to &quot;disturb the peace of any neighborhood or person&quot; and that since persons were present that could be offended, Cohen&#x27;s conviction should be upheld. Sauer did concede that the case turned on the display of the &quot;four-letter word&quot; when pressed on it by Justice Potter Stewart.

===Opinion===
Justice John Harlan announced the decision of the Court, which reversed the appellate court&#x27;s ruling in a 5–4 decision. First, Justice Harlan&#x27;s opinion confirmed that the issue with which the Court was dealing consisted of &quot;a conviction resting solely upon &#x27;speech&#x27;, [citation], not upon any separately identifiable conduct&quot;. Because the conviction was based on speech, Justice Harlan stated that the defendant may be criminally punished only if his speech (the words on his jacket) fell within a specific category of speech that is not protected by the First Amendment. The justice then outlined why the word &quot;fuck&quot; did not fall into one of those categories. As Justice Harlan said in the decision, &quot;...while the particular four-letter word being litigated here is perhaps more distasteful than most others of its genre, it is nevertheless often true that &quot;one man&#x27;s vulgarity is another&#x27;s lyric&quot;&quot;.

=== Blackmun&#x27;s dissent ===
In a dissenting opinion, Justice Harry Blackmun, joined by Burger and Black, suggested that Cohen&#x27;s wearing of the jacket in the courthouse was not speech but &quot;conduct&quot; (an &quot;absurd and immature antic&quot;) and therefore not protected by the First Amendment.

The second paragraph of Blackmun&#x27;s dissent noted that the Supreme Court of California interpreted section 415 in &quot;In re Bushman, 1 Cal.3d 767, 463 P.2d 727&quot; (Cal, 1970), which was decided after the Court of Appeal of California&#x27;s decision in &quot;Cohen v. California&quot; and the Supreme Court of California&#x27;s denial of review. The appeal court&#x27;s ruling was cited in Bushman. Blackmun wrote that the case &quot;ought to be remanded to the California Court of Appeal for reconsideration in the light of the subsequently rendered decision by the State&#x27;s highest tribunal in Bushman&quot; since the interpretation of section 415 used in the appeal court&#x27;s ruling may no longer be the authoritative interpretation.

== Subsequent jurisprudence ==
The &quot;Cohen&quot; ruling has been cited in many subsequent court rulings.

===&quot;National Socialist Party of America v. Village of Skokie&quot;===
The &quot;National Socialist Party of America v. Village of Skokie&quot; was a 1977 United States Supreme Court case. It concerned the constitutionality of an injunction against members of the National Socialist Party of America prohibiting them from holding a march in Skokie, Illinois, which had a large Jewish population. Following that ruling, Illinois Appellate Court and Illinois Supreme Court cited &quot;Cohen v. California&quot; in their respective rulings on the case. The ruling in the Illinois Appellate Court found that, while the actions of the Nazi marchers were offensive to Jewish Skokie residents, mere offensiveness was not enough to justify curtailing free speech and assembly. In the Illinois Supreme Court ruling, the opinion states, &quot;[T]he Constitution does not permit government to decide which types of otherwise protected speech are sufficiently offensive to require protection for the unwilling listener or viewer.&quot;

===&quot;R.A.V. v. St. Paul&quot;===
&quot;R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul&quot; was a 1992 United States Supreme Court case which ruled that St. Paul&#x27;s Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance was unconstitutional because it discriminated by the content of &quot;fighting words&quot;. The Court stated that while the law applied to &quot;fighting words&quot;, which are not protected under the First Amendment, it was unconstitutional because it specifically targeted fighting words that &quot;insult or incite violence on the basis of race, religion, or gender&quot;. In its ruling, the Court acknowledged that while cross-burning was an abhorrent act, the ordinance was nevertheless void and the defendants could be prosecuted by other means. In his opinion on the ruling, Justice John Paul Stevens cited &quot;Cohen&quot; in his claim that &quot;we have consistently construed the &#x27;fighting words&#x27; exception set forth in Chaplinsky narrowly&quot;.

===&quot;The State of Washington v. Marc D. Montgomery&quot;===

In &quot;State of Washington v. Marc D. Montgomery&quot;, 15-year-old Montgomery successfully won an appeal overturning his convictions for disorderly conduct and possession of marijuana on the grounds of free speech. Montgomery was arrested after shouting obscenities, such as &quot;fucking pigs, fucking pig ass hole&quot; at two police officers passing in their patrol car. Citing &quot;Cohen v. California&quot;, the Court ruled that Montgomery&#x27;s words could not be classified as fighting words, and restricting speech based merely on its offensiveness would result in a &quot;substantial risk of suppressing ideas in the process&quot;.

===&quot;FCC v. Pacifica Foundation&quot;===

In the Supreme Court case &quot;Federal Communications Commission v. Pacifica Foundation&quot; (1978), the Court ruled that the commission could regulate broadcasts that were indecent, but not necessarily obscene. In the ruling, the Court stated that while the &quot;Cohen&quot; ruling disputed that Cohen&#x27;s speech would offend unwilling viewers, and that no one in the courthouse had actually complained, the commission was responding to a listener&#x27;s complaint. Furthermore, the ruling noted that the while Cohen was sentenced to 30 days in jail, &quot;even the strongest civil penalty at the commission&#x27;s command does not include criminal prosecution&quot;.

In the dissenting opinion, the ruling cited &quot;Cohen&quot; to argue that listeners could simply turn the radio off, and therefore offensive speech on the radio did not infringe on people&#x27;s right to privacy.

===&quot;Bethel School District v. Fraser&quot;===

In Supreme Court case &quot;Bethel School District v. Fraser&quot; (1986), the court ruled that public schools had the right to regulate speech that was indecent, but not necessarily obscene. The Court stated that while adults could not be prohibited from using offensive speech while making a political statement, this protection did not extend to public school students. The ruling cited &quot;New Jersey v. T.L.O&quot;., arguing that &quot;the constitutional rights of students in public school are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings&quot;.

===Other cases===

The following is an incomplete list of other court cases that have cited &quot;Cohen v. California&quot;:

*&quot;State of Louisiana v. Meyers, 462 So.2d 227 (1984)&quot;
*&quot;Collin v. Smith, 578 F.2d 1197 (7th Cir. 1978)&quot;
*&quot;Lewis v. City of New Orleans, 415 U.S. 130 (1974)&quot;
*&quot;Gooding v. Wilson, 405 U.S. 518 (1972)&quot;
*&quot;New Jersey v. T.L.O., 469 U.S. 325 (1985)&quot;

== Scholarly response ==
In his critique of the &quot;Cohen&quot; ruling, Professor R. George Wright wrote that it would be reasonable to expect all speakers to maintain at least a minimum level of decorum in their speech, such that they do not disrespect &quot;substantial numbers of reasonably tolerant people&quot;. Wright pushed back on claims made by other scholars that Cohen should not be censored because the word &quot;Fuck&quot; in the phrase &quot;Fuck the Draft&quot; expressed the depth of Cohen&#x27;s emotion, and instead argued that it is risky to assume that a slogan, &quot;profane or otherwise, is likely to be particularly apt in expressing deep frustrations&quot;. He further argued that Cohen&#x27;s emotions should not be assumed from his willingness to offend. Subsequently, Wright claimed that the effect of speech on the level of public discourse should not be ignored. Legal scholar Archibald Cox similarly argued that the expression, &quot;Fuck the Draft&quot;, in the &quot;Cohen&quot; ruling unnecessarily lowered the standard of public debate. In his retrospective on the ruling, legal scholar Thomas Krattenmaker points out that at the time of the ruling, uttering the word &quot;Fuck&quot; in public, especially in the presence of women, was exceptionally rare, and that it was not unreasonable that Cohen aimed to be offensive in his use of the word. Despite this, Krattenmaker states that the &quot;Cohen&quot; ruling successfully addresses and disputes arguments that Cohen&#x27;s speech should not be protected because of the location of the speech, its perceived obscenity, and its potential classification as &quot;fighting words&quot;. However, Krattenmaker does argue that governments should perhaps have more power to regulate hurtful speech, and criticizes the Court&#x27;s treatment of the captive audience problem for providing little direction for future rulings.

Legal scholar William Cohen also noted the limitations of the ruling in providing guidance on whether profanity should still be protected in certain locations or given certain audiences. Cohen argues that because the ruling is &quot;narrowly limited to its facts&quot;, it has not been used in future cases pertaining to the regulation of offensive speech, such as &quot;FCC v. Pacifica Foundation&quot;. As a result, the ruling has been contradicted in future cases that have attempted to interpret the limitations of the First Amendment in specific contexts.

<text>Nicholas Bracegirdle (born 28 February 1971), known professionally as Chicane, is an English musician, DJ, composer, songwriter, and record producer. Among his works are singles &quot;Offshore&quot;, an Ibiza trance anthem included in many compilations in both chill-out and dance versions; &quot;Saltwater&quot;, which featured vocals by Clannad member Máire Brennan, and the UK number-one hit &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot;, featuring vocals by Bryan Adams, which also became a top ten hit on singles charts across Europe and Australia.

&quot;Far from the Maddening Crowds&quot;, Chicane&#x27;s debut studio album from 1997, is still considered a seminal release among the trance music community, and his second studio album, 2000&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Sun&quot;, was certified gold in the UK. In 2007, after the hindrance of an ultimately unreleased album (&quot;Easy to Assemble&quot;) in the intervening time, the third artist album &quot;Somersault&quot; was released on Bracegirdle&#x27;s independent record label, followed shortly after by a tenth anniversary re-release of &quot;Far from the Maddening Crowds&quot; which included a new mix of &quot;Offshore&quot; (&quot;Offshore 2007&quot;). He released his fourth studio album &quot;Giants&quot; in 2010, with the fifth studio album &quot;Thousand Mile Stare&quot; following less than two years later, in spring 2012. The sixth studio album, &quot;The Sum of Its Parts&quot;, appeared in early 2015, and his seventh studio album, &quot;The Place You Can&#x27;t Remember, the Place You Can&#x27;t Forget&quot;, was released in 2018. His eighth studio album, &quot;Everything We Had to Leave Behind&quot;, was released in 2021, and his ninth studio album &quot;Nevertheless&quot;, was released two years later in 2023.

In addition, Bracegirdle also worked with Leo Elstob under the alias Disco Citizens, producing a handful of less radio-friendly, vocal-less tracks with a stronger progressive house sound. Working with singer Vanessa St. James and producer Mr. Joshua, Bracegirdle was part of the Mr. Joshua Presents Espiritu project, known for the song &quot;In Praise of the Sun&quot;, released with both English and French vocals. Bracegirdle contributed with executive production on Tomski&#x27;s &quot;14 Hours to Save the Earth&quot;. Nick Bracegirdle has also used the alias, Sitvac, to produce a one-time single, &quot;Wishful Thinking&quot;.

==Early life==
While having trained in classical guitar and piano at an early age, Bracegirdle&#x27;s earliest influences in electronic music came from melodic composers such as Jean Michel Jarre and Vangelis, and synthpop pioneer Vince Clarke; a further influence was the dance hit &quot;Anthem&quot; by the house music group N-Joi. All of this convinced him to pursue the creation of melodic electronic dance music. By the age of 12, he was making music in recording studios and sending demos to record labels.

==Career==
===1996–1998: Initial success and &quot;Far from the Maddening Crowds&quot;===
Bracegirdle&#x27;s first release was the four track EP &quot;Cyanide Music Volume One&quot; in 1996. This contained music styles varying from deep house to trip hop and nu-disco. This was released the Cyanide record label and was a little known precursor to &quot;Offshore&quot;. The Cyanide label then released &quot;Offshore EP #1&quot;, which contained the original version of &quot;Offshore&quot; as well three other tracks, again of varying styles. Eventually Bracegirdle founded his own record label Modena Records, which holds the rights to all his songs and licenses them to other labels for release and distribution. A partnership with Leo Elstob produced the first Disco Citizens single, &quot;Right Here Right Now&quot;, in 1995, as well as the first Chicane single, &quot;Offshore&quot;, in 1996. &quot;Offshore&quot; would be the first of Chicane&#x27;s many releases on Edel UK Records and independent UK dance music record label Xtravaganza Recordings, then-newly founded by DJ and Bracegirdle&#x27;s college friend Alex Gold. It reached No. 12 on the UK Singles Chart (and No. 1 on other UK-based charts compiled by &quot;Mixmag&quot;, &quot;Record Mirror&quot;, and others), the top 40 in multiple European countries, and No. 5 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Music/Club Play charts in 1997 upon re-release. Its inclusion on numerous Ibiza-themed trance music compilation albums (such as &quot;Café del Mar&quot;) attest to its popularity in the nightclubs on the island, one of the worldwide epicentres of dance music.

&quot;Sunstroke&quot;, the follow-up single, attained similar popularity and chart numbers. A third single, &quot;Offshore &#x27;97&quot; (a separate item from the re-release of &quot;Offshore&quot;) is a mashup of &quot;Offshore&quot; with the a capella from the Power Circle song &quot;A Little Love, a Little Life&quot;, mixed by producer and DJ Anthony Pappa. Originally a bootleg, it was turned into an official release, credited to &quot;Chicane with Power Circle&quot;.

Following these releases, Bracegirdle&#x27;s debut studio album &quot;Far from the Maddening Crowds&quot; was released in September 1997. Additional singles that followed were &quot;Lost You Somewhere&quot;, the Benelux release &quot;Red Skies&quot;, and the non-album single &quot;Strong in Love&quot;, for which Bracegirdle used vocals by British singer Sylvia Mason-James (after discovering that she was the vocalist on the Paul Oakenfold and Steve Osborne remix of &quot;Lemon&quot; by U2) and first collaborated on production with Ray &quot;Madman&quot; Hedges (producer for B*Witched and Boyzone).

===1999–2003: Collaborations and &quot;Behind the Sun&quot;===
1999 saw the release of &quot;Saltwater&quot;, a song based on Máire Brennan&#x27;s vocals from &quot;Theme from Harry&#x27;s Game&quot; by the Celtic band Clannad. It surpassed all previous Chicane singles, reaching No. 6 on the UK charts and No. 1 on all five major UK dance charts. The song was used in a Belfast City advertisement broadcast in 2005–2006 across regional channels. The version of the vocals used in &quot;Saltwater&quot;, however, was a new recording by Brennan herself.

After producing a radio remix of Bryan Adams&#x27;s &quot;Cloud Number Nine&quot;, Bracegirdle offered Adams the vocal position on the song &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot;. The vocals Adams recorded were subsequently heavily processed through a vocoder so as to play down his rock music vocal style. The vocal credit was initially not publicised when the single was sent to Pete Tong&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 program &quot;Essential Selection&quot;. On the show, Tong made the song his first &quot;Essential New Tune&quot; selection of the new millennium. It was also Chicane&#x27;s biggest hit, debuting at No. 1 on the UK charts (and notably replacing &quot;American Pie&quot;, Madonna&#x27;s No. 1 single of the previous week), reached No. 3 on the US dance chart and No. 1 on Australian and Russian charts, and made other charts across Europe as well.

On 27 March 2000, Bracegirdle released his second studio album &quot;Behind the Sun&quot;. It was certified gold by the BPI, while &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot; was certified silver. Two other singles were released from the album—the double A-side &quot;No Ordinary Morning / Halcyon&quot;, and &quot;Autumn Tactics&quot;—but neither were as successful as the preceding releases.

In 2002, Bracegirdle co-wrote two songs on Cher&#x27;s album &quot;Living Proof&quot;, &quot;You Take It All&quot; and &quot;Alive Again&quot;, the latter which was released as a single in Europe only. The 2001 Edition of the EA Sports Formula One Video Game Series included the songs &quot;Sunstroke&quot;, &quot;The Drive Home&quot;, and a remix of &quot;Nagasaki Badger&quot;.

===2006–2008: New management and &quot;Somersault&quot;===
Eventually, under the new management of John Cavanagh, April 2006 saw the release of a new single, &quot;Stoned in Love&quot;, on Globe Records through Universal Music Group, featuring singer Tom Jones on vocals. (Press Release). At the time of the announcement the song was also played twice by Pete Tong.

The track received substantial UK TV promotion in the run up to the week of release, featuring utterly live performances on &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot;, &quot;The New Paul O&#x27;Grady Show&quot; and a semi-live performance on BBC&#x27;s now defunct &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. Jones and Bracegirdle were also interviewed on Channel 5 News; When asked in the 5 News interview where he had been since &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot;, Bracegirdle replied that he had been &quot;basically stuffed&quot; by the internet bootlegging of the album &quot;Easy to Assemble&quot;.

In February 2007, Chicane departed from Universal as well; according to the official website, all new material would be released through Modena itself. The follow-up single &quot;Come Tomorrow&quot; was released on 16 July 2007, followed by the third official studio album, &quot;Somersault&quot;, a week later on 23 July 2007. Bracegirdle has entirely self-financed these initial independent releases, as well as subsequent live performances. On 4 May 2007, the Cicada remix of &quot;Come Tomorrow&quot; was played on Radio 1 by Pete Tong.

On 25 August 2008, Chicane released &quot;Bruised Water&quot; with Natasha Bedingfield. Promotional copies of the track were made available, with remixes from Mischa Daniels and Adam K. Following the leak of his 2003 album, Chicane now employs the international internet policing company, Web Sheriff to prevent links to unlicensed material, such as this single and other tracks from his upcoming album, from being posted on various blogs and websites.

In October 2008, Chicane released a greatest hits compilation, &quot;The Best of Chicane - 1996-2008&quot; which features his previous singles, along with a new track called &quot;Wake Up&quot;, a collaboration with Keane. &quot;No Ordinary Morning&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot; and &quot;Saltwater&quot; were re-recorded for the album as the original sound recordings were still owned by Xtravaganza and were unable to be licensed due to the dispute between Chicane and Alex Gold in 2002. Chicane&#x27;s Xtravaganza recordings from &quot;Far From The Maddening Crowds&quot; were no longer owned by Xtravaganza and thus were included in their original form.

===2009–2010: &quot;Giants&quot;===
Bracegirdle worked with producers James Hockley and Richard Searle on the &quot;Re-Work EP&quot; for a targeted summer 2009 release, along with a new and fourth Chicane album and mixes of forthcoming productions by BT and William Orbit. The lead track from the &quot;Re-work EP&quot;, &quot;Poppiholla&quot; based on the track &quot;Hoppípolla&quot; by Sigur Rós, was A-listed on Radio 1. It charted at No. 7 in the top 10 on 19 July 2009, and was added to a reissued version of the &quot;Best of&quot; album. The download single contained a remix by the Thrillseekers, along with a mix by Bracegirdle&#x27;s moniker Disco Citizens. The follow-up to this single was revealed as &quot;Hiding All the Stars&quot;, which contains a sample of Gary Numan&#x27;s &quot;Cars&quot;, which had its first full play on Radio 1&#x27;s Floorfillers on 21 August 2009.

In September, Chicane produced a remix of the classic track &quot;Relax (Don&#x27;t Do It)&quot; by Frankie Goes to Hollywood, which is part of the 25-year anniversary of the seminal track. It was learned that the Re-Work EP was cancelled although no official announcement was ever made in regards to this. Other &#x27;reworked&#x27; tracks that were due to appear on the EP were never mentioned from the initial announcement. Recently stated from Chicane Management; &quot;there were actually quite a few that people never got to hear&quot;. In a June 2010 interview with Impact Magazine, Bracegirdle commented on the &#x27;Re-work EP&#x27; issue. &quot;We covered House Arrest and there&#x27;s a massive bag of legal problems with that record. God knows why. Poppiholla became this complete and utter monster... The best laid plans of mice and men can go completely astray once you have a big record. Things change all the time... the plan was to (release Re-worked) and then the whole thing went completely mental... in a good way.&quot;

The first official word on Chicane&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Giants&quot;, came in January through his Facebook artist profile. &quot;Come Back&quot;, the first single in connection with the new album, is a rework of the Paul Young 1980s hit &quot;Come Back and Stay&quot; and came with a remix by Riley &amp; Durrant. The single was released on 25 April. The same month a new track, &quot;Barefoot&quot;, was added to Chicane&#x27;s website. A laidback, Baleric-style tune, it proved popular with listeners awaiting the new album. This was followed by the track &quot;Titles&quot;.

In May, Bracegirdle officially announced the new album through Facebook. He also revealed a new single &quot;Middledistancerunner&quot;, featuring Owl City&#x27;s Adam Young on vocals. &quot;The Nothing Song&quot; is a remake of another Sigur Ros song: &quot;Untitled 4&quot;. The album also features the singles &quot;Hiding All the Stars&quot;, &quot;Come Back&quot; and &quot;Poppiholla&quot;.

The album and &quot;Middledistancerunner&quot; were released on 2 August 2010. During the first week of release, a new track, called Velo, was given away as a free download via Chicane&#x27;s website. In November the track &quot;Where Do I Start&quot; was released as a single. Among others it was remixed by Armin van Buuren.

===2011–2015: &quot;Thousand Mile Stare&quot; and &quot;The Sum of Its Parts&quot;===

An upcoming Chicane single was announced in April through Twitter. &quot;Going Deep&quot;, featuring British producer and rapper Aggi Dukes, had its first airplay on Steve Smart&#x27;s radio show &quot;Friday Night Kiss&quot; on 8 April. The video was released at the start of July and tells the story of Aggi Dukes—represented by a comical puppet, starting off in a cafe in the UK, before he undertakes on an epic party holiday to Magaluf, Mallorca. The single was released on 14 August, and remixes were made by Steve Smart &amp; WestFunk, and VillaNaranjos. On 18 June, Chicane released the &#x27;Wawa Remix&#x27; of his production &quot;Spirit&quot; as a free download from the official homepage.

On 29 July 2011, Chicane revealed a preview of the title track for the then forthcoming artist album &quot;Thousand Mile Stare&quot; on YouTube. Unfortunately, by November it was clear that the album had been leaked onto the internet, the second time such an occasion had occurred in Chicane&#x27;s career. For a time it seemed doubtful whether the album would ever get released, but an exclusive box set version of &quot;Thousand Mile Stare&quot; was released on 12 December 2011. It included a cassette-shaped USB flash drive of rare material and an album of remixes. Each early order contained the buyer&#x27;s name on the album sleeve. The regular version of the album, which contained three previously unreleased tracks, was released on 16 April 2012, with an album launch live show following in London at Koko on 27 April with guest performances from Kate Walsh, Vigri, Aggi Dukes and support from VillaNaranjos.

On 13 April 2012, the Dutch label Armada Music announced that they had joined with Chicane&#x27;s UK record label Modena Records. After having worked together extensively throughout the past four years, with Armada Music releasing Chicane&#x27;s singles and albums for the Benelux, Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Poland, Armada will be representing Chicane worldwide in the future.

In July 2012, Chicane collaborated with Ferry Corsten to write and produce a track called &quot;One Thousand Suns&quot;, featuring singer Christian Burns, and loosely based on Chicane&#x27;s &quot;Thousand Mile Stare&quot;.

In a 9 December 2012 interview with Eightoctaves.com, Chicane announced that he was working on a new album. He also said in the interview that &quot;There are going to be some pretty stunning collaborations and guest appearances, I hope. I&#x27;ve just been recording in Mumbai with Anushka and that track is going to be stunning.&quot;

In 2013, Chicane released &quot;One More Time&quot; which featured the vocals of Duane Harden.

In April 2014, Chicane had a dispute with DJ Mark Knight about his unauthorized sampling of &quot;Saltwater&quot; in Knight&#x27;s track &quot;The Return of Wolfy&quot;.

On 25 May 2014, Chicane released the single &quot;No More I Sleep&quot;, featuring the vocals of Senadee.

In the July 2014 issue of the &quot;Sun:Sets&quot; radio show, Chicane named the title of the upcoming album &quot;The Sum of Its Parts&quot;. It was released on 25 January 2015. An unconfirmed pre-order listing on iTunes UK showed an early release date (16 November 2014) and a different track list running order. The fourth single from the album is called &quot;Still With Me&quot; and is sung by British artist Bo Bruce. A remix by Andreas Van Hoog was premiered on Forth One Radio. The single was officially released on 26 October 2014.

Chicane released &quot;Oxygen&quot; as a remix EP on 5 July 2015, the fifth single from &quot;The Sum of Its Parts&quot;. On 2 October 2015, he released two new tracks &quot;Ibiza Strings&quot; and &quot;Ibiza Bleeps&quot; as part his second extended play &quot;Ibiza&quot;. He released the sixth and final single &quot;Fibreglasses&quot; on 30 October 2015.

===2016–2019: &quot;Twenty&quot; and &quot;The Place You Can&#x27;t Remember, the Place You Can&#x27;t Forget&quot;===
On 29 July 2016, Chicane released a compilation album titled &quot;Twenty&quot; as a celebration of his twentieth anniversary in the music industry. The album was preceded by the lead single &quot;Carry Me Home&quot; (a rework of the song of the same name by Gloworm) featuring the vocals of Steve Edwards; released on 3 June 2016.

&quot;Twenty&quot; features Chicane&#x27;s greatest hits, plus brand new remixes by Philip George, Kryder, Grum, Jody Wisternoff, Thomas Datt, and himself. As with the 2008 best of album, &quot;No Ordinary Morning&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot; and &quot;Saltwater&quot; are re-recordings as the original sound recordings were still owned by Xtravaganza and were unable to be licensed for this compilation due to a dispute between Chicane and Xtaravagnza boss Alex Gold, dated back to 2002. Chicane&#x27;s previous Xtravaganza recordings which had been distributed by Edel Records in 1996/1997 are featured in their original form as Xtravaganza lost the rights to those sound recordings, with &quot;Strong in Love&quot; being released for the first time since its original release in 1998.

On 16 February 2018, Chicane released a mix compilation album titled &quot;Sun:Sets 2018 (Selected by Chicane)&quot;.

In 2018, Chicane announced his seventh studio album on his weekly &quot;Sun:Sets&quot; podcast. The album &quot;The Place You Can&#x27;t Remember, the Place You Can&#x27;t Forget&quot; was released on 8 June 2018. It includes the singles &quot;Gorecki&quot; (originally written &amp; performed by Lou Rhodes and the band Lamb) and &quot;Serendipity&quot; featuring Tracy Ackerman.

In 2019, Chicane released the follow-up to the original &quot;Sun:Sets&quot; compilation with the album titled &quot;Sun:Sets 2019 (Selected by Chicane)&quot;.

===2020–present: &quot;Everything We Had to Leave Behind&quot;===

In May 2020, Chicane released &quot;Behind The Sun (2020 Anniversary Mixes)&quot;, featuring new mixes and remixes from other artists of the original tracks from the 2000 album.

On 23 April 2021, Chicane released his eighth studio album, titled &quot;Everything We Had to Leave Behind&quot;.

On 9 June 2023, Chicane released his ninth studio album, titled &quot;Nevertheless&quot;.

Also in 2023, on 1 December, Chicane released &quot;The Greatest Misses&quot;, a sixteen-track compilation featuring songs created by Chicane that, despite earning critical acclaim and fan approval, failed to achieve chart-topping success.

On 15th November 2024, Chicane released &quot;Trampolines&quot;, a thirteen-track collection. 

==Musical style==
===Style===
Bracegirdle describes his music as being strongly influenced by the relaxed, summer atmosphere of Ibiza, where he was taken on holidays as a child. In an interview in 2012, Bracegirdle stated that he does not draw inspiration from dance music; but from film soundtracks and musicians like Brian Eno and Trevor Horn. He wrote &quot;I have a lot of time for producers like myself, BT, Eric Prydz, but as I said, they are not really an influence upon me. It&#x27;s artists such as Vangelis that inspired me many years back&quot;.

His first two studio albums, along with &quot;Giants&quot; – the fourth studio album – are known for atmospheric, ambient melodies and shifting moods and tempos, particularly &quot;Far from the Maddening Crowds&quot;, which has been called &quot;a soundtrack for an average day&quot;.

Bracegirdle&#x27;s career took a turn following the release of &quot;Behind the Sun&quot;, at which point he stated desires to focus on being a recording artist and producer, starting with planned work on Bryan Adams&#x27; then-upcoming studio album. (However, Adams would not release another studio album until 2004.) Bracegirdle also put remix work on hold at this point, reportedly turning down Jean Michel Jarre, Moby, and both Kylie and Dannii Minogue. The music that followed also changed; in more recent interviews, Bracegirdle has noted that he is consciously moving away from the influences of Ibiza in his songwriting—calling it a return to his &quot;song writing background&quot; as opposed to dance music.

Bracegirdle&#x27;s dance music productions have caused him to be incorrectly identified as a DJ throughout his career. As early as 1997, &quot;The Mirror&quot; called him a &quot;top DJ&quot; in an article, while the &quot;Portland Press Herald&quot; published a 2000 review in which both Chicane and BT were referred to as DJs. Most recently, in 2007, Bracegirdle remarked in an interview that many people still hold this belief.

&quot;Far from the Maddening Crowds&quot; and &quot;Behind the Sun&quot; were both primarily recorded at Chicane&#x27;s personal recording studio, Modena One (sharing the name of his own record label), located at his parents&#x27; house. Co-producers who worked on these albums are Leo Elstob, Salt Tank, Ray &quot;Madman&quot; Hedges, and Martin Brannigan. Tomski was commissioned to program the opening tracks (&quot;Early&quot; and &quot;Overture&quot;) on both albums and contributed snippets and sounds to other tracks. However, Bracegirdle has stated that he works alone when in his own studio. Recently, references to a studio called &quot;Modena 2&quot; have appeared in liner notes since the April 2006 release of the &quot;Stoned in Love&quot; single.

With the April 2011 premiere of the Chicane single &quot;Going Deep&quot; Bracegirdle stressed his own statement, that &#x27;Chicane music is not bound by a certain genre&#x27;. &#x27;Going Deep&#x27; is certainly a new turn in the sound as it is a blend of 90s retro disco, rap in a modern house, trance package.

===Live===
Chicane also performs live shows as a full-fledged band, which has included a rotating line-up of singers, guitarists, drummers, and flautists, as well as Bracegirdle himself on keyboards. Justine Suissa, who provided vocals on &quot;Autumn Tactics&quot; from &quot;Behind the Sun&quot;, toured with the band in 2000. English electronic producer Tom Jankiewicz (Tomski) was a frequent musical collaborator with Chicane from 1995 to 2006, and he also played keyboards and engineered in the band during that period. Session drummers in the band, notably, have included Mark Pusey (Eminem, Natasha Bedingfield, Sway), Shovell from M People, Simon Merry (Natalie Imbruglia) and David Barbarossa from Bow Wow Wow.

The band&#x27;s current line-up since 2006 consists of the following musicians:

* Nick Bracegirdle (Chicane) – keyboards, programming 
* Natasha Andrews, Kristin Hosein or Jaki Graham – vocals
* Simon Small – guitars
* Carl Holt – bass 
* Mark Pusey (2005–present) – drums
* Simon Merry – drums (2009–present)
Though the band&#x27;s singers usually substitute for the original vocalists from the song due to the latter&#x27;s other recording commitments, there have been exceptions; for example, both Maire Brennan and Bryan Adams performed live with the band in Ibiza in 2000. The former took place at one of the annual Ibiza festivals held by MTV at the turn of the 2000s, while the latter took place at a heavily promoted concert hosted by Xtravaganza on 4 August at Privilege Ibiza, which was attended by over 7000, including Bono and Noel Gallagher.

Chicane has also played at major European music festivals, such as the Glastonbury Festival and Creamfields in England and the Roskilde Festival in Denmark; as well as Red Square in Moscow.

Chicane has performed remixes (specifically, the &quot;Tomski vs. Disco Citizens&quot; remixes) live, as shown by a track listing from Chicane&#x27;s 22 January 2000 performance at the Palladium in Cologne, Germany. This is unusual in that remixes, as products of audio editing, are not generally considered instrumental performances in their own right. At least some aspects of this are credited to Tomski himself, on stage.

Bracegirdle also made a guest appearance live with Bryan Adams at the 2000 Slane Concert, as seen on Adams&#x27; &quot;Live at Slane Castle&quot; DVD.

<text>A Căpcăun is a creature in Romanian folklore, depicted as an ogre who kidnaps children or young ladies (mostly princesses). It represents evil, as do its counterparts &quot;Zmeu&quot; and the &quot;Balaur&quot;. In most Romanian publications of other European works the names of creatures such as &quot;Ogres&quot; or &quot;Trolls&quot; are usually translated as &quot;căpcăun&quot;. The Romanian word appears to have meant &quot;Dog-head&quot; (&quot;căp&quot; being a form of &quot;cap&quot;, meaning &quot;head&quot;, and &quot;căun&quot; a derivative of &quot;câine&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;). According to Romanian folkloric phantasy, the &quot;căpcăun&quot; has a dog head, sometimes with four eyes, with eyes in the nape, or with four legs, but whose main characteristic is anthropophagy. 

The term &quot;căpcăun&quot; also means &quot;Tatar chieftain&quot; or &quot;Turk chieftain&quot;, as well &quot;pagan&quot;.

Some linguists consider &quot;căpcăun&quot; to be an echo of a title or administrative rank, such as &quot;kapkan&quot; (also &quot;kavhan&quot;, &quot;kaphan&quot;, &quot;kapgan&quot;) used by various Central Asian tribes who invaded Eastern Europe during late antiquity and the medieval era, such as the Pannonian Avars, Bulgars and Pechenegs.

<doc id="421812" wikidata="Q303703" url="?curid=421812" title="Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester">
<text>Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester ( – 25 June 1218), known as Simon IV (or V) de Montfort and as Simon de Montfort the Elder, was a French nobleman and knight of the early 13th century. He is widely regarded as one of the great military commanders of the Middle Ages. He took part in the Fourth Crusade and was one of the prominent figures of the Albigensian Crusade. Montfort is mostly noted for his campaigns in the latter, notably for his battle at Muret. He died at the Siege of Toulouse in 1218. He was Lord of Montfort from 1188 to his death and Earl of Leicester in England from 1204. He was also Viscount of Albi, Béziers and Carcassonne from 1213, as well as Count of Toulouse from 1215.

==Early life==
He was the son of Simon de Montfort (d. 1188), lord of Montfort l&#x27;Amaury in France near Paris, and Amicia de Beaumont, daughter of Robert de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Leicester. He succeeded his father as lord of Montfort in 1181; in 1190 he married Alix de Montmorency, the daughter of Bouchard III de Montmorency. She shared his religious zeal and would accompany him on his campaigns.

In 1199, while taking part in a tournament at Ecry-sur-Aisne, he took the cross in the company of Count Thibaud de Champagne and went on the Fourth Crusade. The crusade soon fell under Venetian control, and was diverted to Zara on the Adriatic Sea. Pope Innocent III had specifically warned the Crusaders not to attack fellow Christians; Simon opposed the attack and urged a waiting Zara delegation not to surrender, claiming the Frankish troops would not support the Venetians in this. As a result, the delegation returned to Zara and the city resisted. Since most Frankish lords were in debt to the Venetians, they did support the attack and the city was sacked in 1202. Simon did not participate in this action and was one of its most outspoken critics. He and his associates, including Abbot Guy of Vaux-de-Cernay, left the crusade when the decision was taken to divert once more to Constantinople to place Alexius IV Angelus on the throne. Instead, Simon and his followers travelled to the court of King Emeric of Hungary and thence to Acre.

His mother was the eldest daughter of Robert of Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Leicester. After the death of her brother Robert de Beaumont, 4th Earl of Leicester, without children in 1204, she inherited half of his estates and a claim to the Earldom of Leicester. The division of the estates was effected early in 1207, by which the rights to the earldom were assigned to Amicia and Simon. However, King John of England took possession of the lands himself in February 1207, and confiscated its revenues. Later, in 1215, the lands were passed into the hands of Simon&#x27;s cousin, Ranulph de Meschines, 4th Earl of Chester.

==Later life==
Simon remained on his estates in France before taking the cross once more, this time against suspected Christian dissidence. He participated in the initial campaign of the Albigensian Crusade in 1209, and after the fall of Carcassonne, was elected leader of the crusade and viscount of the confiscated territories of the Raymond-Roger Trencavel family.

Simon was rewarded with the territory conquered from Raymond VI of Toulouse, which in theory made him the most important landowner in Occitania. He became feared for his ruthlessness. In 1210 he burned 140 Cathars in the village of Minerve who refused to recant – though he spared those who did. In another widely reported incident, prior to the sack of the village of Lastours, he brought prisoners from the nearby village of Bram and had their eyes gouged out and their ears, noses and lips cut off. One prisoner, left with a single good eye, led them into the village as a warning.

Simon&#x27;s part in the crusade had the full backing of his feudal superior, the King of France, Philip Augustus. However, historian Alistair Horne, in his book &quot;Seven Ages of Paris,&quot; states that Philip &quot;turned a blind eye to Simon de Montfort&#x27;s crusade ... of which he disapproved, but readily accepted the spoils to his exchequer&quot;. Following the latter&#x27;s success in winning Normandy from John Lackland of England, he was approached by Innocent III to lead the crusade but turned this down. He was heavily committed to defending his gains against John and against the emerging alliance among England, the Empire and Flanders.

However, Philip claimed full rights over the lands of the house of St Gilles; some historians believe his dispatch of de Montfort and other northern barons to be, at the very least, an exploratory campaign to reassert the rights of the French Crown in Le Midi. Philip may well also have wanted to appease the papacy after the long dispute over his marriage, which had led to excommunication. He also sought to counter any adventure by King John of England, who had marriage and fealty ties also with the Toulouse comtal house. Meanwhile, others have assessed Philip&#x27;s motives to include removing over-mighty subjects from the North, and distracting them in adventure elsewhere, so they could not threaten his increasingly successful restoration of the power of the French crown in the north.

Simon is described as a man of unflinching religious orthodoxy, deeply committed to the Dominican order and the uprooting of heresy. Dominic Guzman, later Saint Dominic, spent several years during the war in the Midi at Fanjeau, which was Simon&#x27;s headquarters, especially in the winter months when the crusading forces were depleted. Simon had other key confederates in this enterprise, which many historians view as a conquest of southern lands by greedy men from the north. Many of them had been involved in the Fourth Crusade. One was Guy Vaux de Cernay, head of a Cistercian abbey not more than twenty miles from Simon&#x27;s patrimony of Montfort Aumary, who accompanied the crusade in the Languedoc and became bishop of Carcassonne. Meanwhile, Peter de Vaux de Cernay, the nephew of Guy, wrote an account of the crusade. Historians generally consider this to be propaganda to justify the actions of the crusaders; Peter justified their cruelties as doing &quot;the work of God&quot; against morally depraved heretics. He portrayed outrages committed by the lords of the Midi as the opposite.

Simon was an energetic campaigner, rapidly moving his forces to strike at those who had broken their faith with him – and there were many, as some local lords switched sides whenever the moment seemed propitious. The Midi was a warren of small fortified places, as well as home to some highly fortified cities, such as Toulouse, Carcassonne and Narbonne. Simon showed ruthlessness and daring as well as being particularly brutal with those who betrayed their pledges – as for example, Martin Algai, lord of Biron. In 1213 Simon defeated Peter II of Aragon at the Battle of Muret. This completed the defeat of the Albigensians, but Simon carried on the campaign as a war of conquest. He was appointed lord over all the newly acquired territory as Count of Toulouse and Duke of Narbonne (1215). He spent two years in warfare in many parts of Raymond&#x27;s former territories; he besieged Beaucaire, which had been taken by Raymond VII of Toulouse, from 6 June 1216 to 24 August 1216.

Raymond spent most of this period in the Crown of Aragon, but corresponded with sympathisers in Toulouse. There were rumours in September 1216 that he was on his way to Toulouse. Abandoning the siege of Beaucaire, Simon partially sacked Toulouse, perhaps intended as punishment of the citizens. Raymond returned in October 1217 to take possession of Toulouse. Simon hastened to besiege the city, meanwhile sending his wife, Alix de Montmorency, with bishop Foulques of Toulouse and others, to the French court to plead for support. After maintaining the siege for nine months, Simon was killed on 25 June 1218 while combating a sally by the besieged. His head was smashed by a stone from a mangonel, operated, according to one source, by the (&quot;ladies and girls and women&quot;) of Toulouse. He was buried in the Cathedral of Saint-Nazaire at Carcassonne. His body was later moved by one of his sons to be reinterred at Montfort l&#x27;Amaury. A tombstone in the south transept of the cathedral is inscribed &quot;of Simon de Montfort&quot;.

==Children==
Simon and Alix had:
* Amaury de Montfort married Beatrix of Viennois, died in 1241 returning from the Barons&#x27; Crusade
* Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, married Eleanor of England, killed at the Battle of Evesham on 4 August 1265
* Guy de Montfort, Count of Bigorre, married Petronille, Countess of Bigorre, on 6 November 1216 and died at the siege of Castelnaudary on 20 July 1220
* Amicie de Montfort, married Gaucher de Joigny, founded the convent at Montargis and died there in 1252
* Petronilla, became abbess of the Cistercian nunnery of St. Antoine&#x27;s

==Inheritance==
His French estates passed to his eldest son, Amaury, while his second son, Simon, eventually gained possession of the earldom of Leicester and played a major role in the reign of Henry III of England. He led the barons&#x27; rebellion against Henry during the Second Barons&#x27; War, and subsequently became the de facto ruler of England.

<doc id="421815" wikidata="Q5676252" url="?curid=421815" title="Harvard-Westlake School">
<text>Harvard-Westlake School is an independent, co-educational university preparatory day school in Los Angeles, California, with about 1,600 students in grades seven through twelve. The school has two campuses: the middle school campus in Holmby Hills and the high school (the &quot;Upper School&quot;) in Studio City. It was previously a member of the G30 Schools group. It is not affiliated with Harvard University. The school has been recognized by The Schools Index as one of the top 150 schools in the world and among the top 20 in North America.

== History ==
=== Harvard School for Boys ===
The Harvard School for Boys was established in 1900 by Grenville C. Emery as a military academy on the site of a barley field at the corner of Western Avenue and Sixteenth Street (now Venice Boulevard) in Los Angeles. Emery was originally from Boston, and around 1900 he asked Harvard University for permission to use its name for his secondary school; it was granted by university president Charles W. Eliot. In 1911, it secured endorsement from the Episcopal Church and became a non-profit organization. In 1937, the school moved to its campus at the former Hollywood Country Club on Coldwater Canyon in Studio City after receiving a $25,000 ($ today) loan from aviation pioneer Donald Douglas. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Harvard School gradually discontinued both boarding and its standing as a military academy, while expanding its enrollment, courses, classes, teachers, and curriculum.

=== Westlake School for Girls ===
The Westlake School for Girls was established in 1904 by Jessica Smith Vance and Frederica de Laguna in what is now downtown Los Angeles, California, as an exclusively female institution offering elementary and secondary education. It was named for nearby Westlake Park, now known as MacArthur Park. At the time, the school was a for-profit alternative to the older non-profit Marlborough School.

In 1927, it moved to its current campus on North Faring Road in Holmby Hills, California. The school was purchased by Sydney Temple, whose daughter, Helen Temple Dickinson, was headmistress until 1966, when Westlake became a non-profit institution. The Temple family owned the school until 1977, with Dickinson serving in an ex officio capacity. In 1968, Westlake became exclusively a secondary school.

=== Merger ===
As both schools continued to grow towards in late 1980s, and as the schools&#x27; reputations and desirability depended less on gender exclusivity, the trustees of both Harvard and Westlake agreed to a merger in 1989. The two institutions had long been &quot;de facto&quot; sister schools and interacted socially. Highly controversial at the time, complete integration and coeducation began in the fall of 1991.

=== Cheating scandal ===
In 2008, six sophomores were expelled and more than a dozen other students faced suspensions for cheating.

== Campuses ==
The school is split between two campuses: grades 7–9, the Middle School, at the former Westlake campus in Holmby Hills and grades 10–12, the Upper School, at the former Harvard campus in Studio City.

A four-year renovation of the Middle School campus, completed in September 2008, replaced the administration building, the library, and the instrumental music building with a new library, science center, and administration office. The project also added the Bing Performing Arts Center, which has a two-level, 800-seat theater, a black box theater, and a dance studio.

Buildings on the Upper School campus include: the Munger Science Center and computer lab; the Rugby building which houses the English department, 300-seat theater, costume shop, and drama lab; the Seaver building, home to the foreign language and history departments as well as administrative offices and the visitor lobby; Chalmers, which houses the performing arts and math departments, book store, cafeteria, sandwich window, and student lounge; Kutler, which houses the Brendan Kutler Center for Interdisciplinary Studies and Independent Research and the Feldman-Horn visual arts studios, dark room, video labs, and gallery.
The athletic facilities include Taper Gymnasium, used for volleyball and basketball as well as final exams; Hamilton Gymnasium, the older gymnasium still used for team practices and final exams; Copses Family Pool, an Olympic-size facility; and Ted Slavin Field for football, soccer, track &amp; field, lacrosse, and field hockey. The school also maintains an off-campus baseball facility, the O&#x27;Malley Family Field, in Encino, California.

The Upper School campus has the three-story Seeley G. Mudd Library, renovated in summer 2023, and Saint Saviour&#x27;s Chapel, a vestige from the days of Harvard School for Boys&#x27; Episcopal.

In 2017, Harvard Westlake spent more than $40 million to buy Weddington Golf &amp; Tennis, a 16-acre country club located less than a mile from the Upper School campus, with plans to build an athletics center on the location.

Tuition for the 2024–2025 school year is $49,700, with a new student fee of $2,500. Other expenses—which include books, meals, and class activities—typically average $2,500 to $3,500— with an additional $3,000 to $3,600 for those who take advantage of the school&#x27;s comprehensive bus service.

Harvard-Westlake provided $14 million in financial aid in 2023. That year, about 20% of the student body received financial aid, which averaged $33,500 for each student that received financial aid.

== Academic achievement ==
For the HW Class of 2019, average SATs were 716 (verbal) and 745 (math). Among the 292 seniors, there were 27 National Merit Semifinalists. For the 2019–2020 school year, Niche ranked Harvard-Westlake the best private high school in Los Angeles, the 2nd-best private high school in California, and the 6th-best private school in the United States.

== Athletics ==
Harvard-Westlake fields 22 varsity teams in the California Interscholastic Federation Southern Section, as well as teams on the junior varsity, club, and junior high levels. 60% of HW students participate in interscholastic sports.

== Notable alumni ==
== Notable faculty ==

* Amy Alcott (born 1956) – golfer
* Caitlin Flanagan (born 1961) – writer and social critic
* Ethan Katz (born 1983) – pitching coach for the Chicago White Sox
* Ashton Kutcher (born 1978) – actor

<text>Michael Torke (; born September 22, 1961) is an American composer who writes music influenced by jazz and minimalism.

Torke was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where he attended Wilson Elementary School, graduated from Wauwatosa East High School, and studied at the Eastman School of Music with Joseph Schwantner and Christopher Rouse, and at Yale University.

==Works==

Sometimes described as a post-minimalist, his most characteristically postminimal piece is &quot;Four Proverbs&quot;, in which the syllable for each pitch is fixed and variations in the melody produce streams of nonsense words. Other works in this style include &quot;Book of Proverbs&quot; and &quot;Song of Isaiah&quot;. An early piece where he first used a certain post-minimalist style was &quot;Vanada&quot;, made in 1984. His best-known work is probably &quot;Javelin&quot;, which he composed in 1994, commissioned by the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games in celebration of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s 50th anniversary season, in conjunction with the 1996 Summer Olympics. Commissioned by Disney and Michael Eisner for the New York Philharmonic&#x27;s Millennium Celebration, he wrote &quot;Four Seasons,&quot; an oratorio for chorus and orchestra celebrating various aspects of the months. He wrote a ballet in 2002, &quot;The Contract,&quot; with choreography by James Kudelka. Torke was also commissioned to help Chicago celebrate the centennial of Daniel Burnham&#x27;s 1909 Plan of Chicago and produced a work entitled &quot;Plans&quot; that was performed at the Grant Park Music Festival in June 2009.

A synesthete, he is the composer of numerous pieces that include colors in the titles (&quot;Bright Blue Music&quot;, &quot;Ecstatic Orange&quot;), later made into the suite &quot;Color Music&quot; (1991). Other pieces include the opera &quot;The Directions&quot; (1986), &quot;Rust&quot; (1989), influenced by rap and disco, &quot;Telephone Book&quot; (1985, 1995), &quot;Adjustable Wrench&quot;, and &quot;Ash&quot; (1989) and &quot;Mass&quot; (1990), which received criticism for an attempt at the style of Beethoven and Mendelssohn.

In 2003, he created his own record label, Ecstatic Records, on which he re-released a set of six 1990s CDs that were deleted by the now out-of-business Argo Records, which was a subsidiary of Decca Records.

His opera &quot;Pop&#x27;pea&quot;, a rock opera version of Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione di Poppea&quot;, was commissioned by the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris and premiered there on May 29, 2012.

<doc id="421823" wikidata="Q5690798" url="?curid=421823" title="Health and social welfare in Communist Czechoslovakia">
<text>Health and social welfare in Communist Czechoslovakia can be defined by increases in maternity benefits, fluctuations in birthrate and abortion rate and decreases in factors such as infant mortality. The healthcare system featured an excess of bureaucracy, small-scale corruption, failing medical infrastructure, and outdated medical supply, while the social welfare system also fell behind in areas such as housing and nurseries.

== Characteristics ==
In the 1980s, Czechoslovakia had a comprehensive and universal system of social security under which everyone was entitled to free medical care and medicine. National health planning emphasized preventive medicine. Factory and local health care centers, first aid stations, and a variety of medical clinics supplemented hospitals and other inpatient institutions. The ratio of physicians to inhabitants had improved steadily, climbing from 1 per 745 in 1954 to 1 per 270 in 1989, although there were shortages of doctors in rural areas. The shift in the distribution of health resources in the 1960s and 1970s was dramatic; facilities were improved, and the number of health care personnel in Slovakia and rural areas increased in general. Despite the improvements, about 40% of all the medical equipment was obsolete, facilities were outdated and in short supply, the bureaucracy was excessive, and small bribery was widespread.

== Spas ==
Spas in Czechoslovakia were part of the health care system. In 1985 more than 460,000 people (5% of whom were children) stayed at the 35 spas in the Czech lands and 23 spas in Slovakia. Many spas had existed for centuries, such as Bardejov (since the 13th century) in Slovakia and Karlovy Vary in the Czech lands. Many of them specialized in the care and treatment of particular kinds of ailments. All had either mineral or hot springs, and some also offered mud treatments. In bygone days, the spas were frequented by European royalty and the wealthy, but in the 1980s they were open to all, including foreign tourists (who made up 10% of the patients in 1985). A number of people visited spas on vouchers provided by their trade unions.

== Life expectancy ==
In 1984 life expectancy in Czechoslovakia was 67 years for men and 75 years for women. In 1950 women&#x27;s life expectancy was approximately 4.6 years longer than men&#x27;s; by 1983 this difference had increased to nearly 7.5 years. While female life expectancy grew slightly, male life expectancy stagnated and in males aged 15, it increased. Infant mortality stood at 11.9 per 1,000 live births in 1988, down from 15.6 per 1,000 in 1975. As with medical care, the gap in life expectancy between the Czech lands and Slovakia was narrowed during this period.

== Pensions ==
In 1985 slightly more than one-quarter of the Czechoslovak population received some kind of pension; the elderly, the disabled, widows, and orphans were all entitled to assistance. Social security benefits (primarily retirement and disability) were equal for all wage earners. The average pension was less than Kcs1,000 per month (workers received an average pension of about Kcs 1,130, cooperative farmers about Kcs880, and independent farmers about Kcs720); this put pensioners among the lowest income earners. A substantial minority of the retired (23%) took up employment again to supplement their pensions.

== Maternity and childcare benefits ==
Women workers had a full complement of maternity and childcare benefits. Maternity leave (at 90% of full pay) was twenty-six weeks in the 1980s; an additional nine weeks were available for single mothers or for mothers having multiple births. Employers could not deny a woman&#x27;s request for an additional year of unpaid leave for child rearing (without loss of job seniority). A system of child allowances and maternity grants also assisted women who took unpaid leave. Women were allowed three days of annual leave in case of illness within the family. There were substantial family allowances, in addition to direct grants, to single parents or families with handicapped children. An unmarried mother, widow, or divorced mother could not be fired if she had a child under three years of age; if she had children between three and fifteen years of age, her employer had to find her another job before dismissing her.

== Facilities for younger children ==
Nursery facilities for younger children were in very short supply; in 1984 they could accommodate less than 10% of children under five years of age. Beyond the sheer lack of space, nurseries were poorly distributed and were often concentrated in older centers rather than in new housing developments where young families were likely to reside. Kindergartens were in better supply, and a much higher percentage of children between the ages of three and six years attended these schools.

== Birthrate and abortion rate ==
High employment of women and inadequate services contributed to the decline in Czechoslovakia&#x27;s birthrate in the 1960s. Live births during the decade averaged 16 per 1,000 inhabitants, a significant drop from the 1950s. By 1968 the fertility rate was under 2 children per woman (in comparison with almost 3 in the 1950s); at this rate the population would not replace itself. In the Czech lands, the population growth rate stood at its 1930s low; in Catholic Slovakia, it was the lowest on record. The government adopted a variety of explicitly pronatalist policies in the 1970s. Family allowances increased, especially for second and third children. By 1973 a family with three children received roughly one-third the average worker&#x27;s salary in allowances. Birth grants doubled so that they were the equivalent of two to four weeks of family income. Low-interest loans to newlyweds were designed so that a portion of the principal was canceled with the birth of each child (Kcs 1,000 for the first and Kcs4,000 for each subsequent child). All told, the financial incentives were substantial. In addition, couples with children had priority on apartment s and were entitled to larger living quarters, no small inducement in the face of Czechoslovakia&#x27;s chronic housing shortage. Pronatalist policies appear to have had a strong influence on population growth during the 1970s. The birthrate climbed from its 1968 low (14.9 per 1,000 inhabitants) to a peak of 19.9 per 1,000 inhabitants in 1974—one of the highest rates among industrial nations. Perhaps a quarter of this increase reflected the increase in the number of women of child-bearing age in the 1970s. After 1974, however, the birthrate steadily declined, falling to 14.5 by 1985. Figures indicated that a trend toward one-child families was emerging. The message seemed to be that after one decade the government&#x27;s aid program was ineffective.

A major factor influencing the birthrate was the abortion rate. The number of abortions fluctuated between the 1950s and 1980s, dropping in the early 1960s and the early 1970s. In 1985 there were reportedly 144,712 abortions, or 39 abortions per 100 pregnancies (33.5 per 100 in the Slovak Socialist Republic and 42.1 per 100 in the Czech Socialist Republic). It has been suggested that abortion has remained one of the most favored means of birth control, despite the risks involved. A 1986 change in the abortion law (eliminating the panel needed to approve a request for an abortion) suggested that the regime was giving up in its efforts to reverse at least this aspect of the adverse demographic trends. In 1988 the abortion rate hit its peak, at 94 abortions for every 100 live pregnancies.

== Housing ==
Since statistics did not always provide a comparison between the numbers of households and existing housing units, the housing deficit remained difficult to gauge. A comparison of the number of marriages annually and construction of new 1 housing units between 1960 and 1975 shows that construction exceeded marriages only in 1975. The deficit was most acute in the 1960s, when an average of housing units was built for every 10 marriages; in 1985 the ratio rose to an average of 8.8 units per 10 marriages.

This approximation underestimated the housing deficit: it ignored divorces, the number of extended families living together who would have preferred separate housing, and the decay of old housing . Even waiting lists underestimated how inadequate housing was in the 1980s. Separate housing for single adults had such a low priority with planners that single adults found it difficult even to get on a housing list.

One of the factors contributing to the housing shortage was the low construction rate of rental housing. Major reasons for this were high inflation, high construction costs, and low (heavily subsidized) rents. In 1985 the average building cost for apartments rose to Kcs2,523 per square meter, and the average monthly rent—for the seventh consecutive year—was Kcs358. Construction of individual homes peaked in 1977 at 40,107 and decreased to 29,608 in 1985. Building a home privately was possible, but acquiring labor and materials was difficult and sometimes risky; it often meant borrowing machinery illegally or paying bribes for materials.

Despite substantial gains in the 1970s, Czechoslovakia entered the 1980s with a housing shortage that was likely to take years to remedy. In 1986 the government announced a slight cutback in new housing construction for the 1986–90 housing plan, further aggravating the situation.

<doc id="421825" wikidata="Q45177" url="?curid=421825" title="Visa Waiver Program">
<text>The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) is a program of the United States government that allows nationals of specific countries to travel to the United States for tourism, business, or while in transit for up to 90 days without having to obtain a visa. It applies to all fifty U.S. states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as to Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands, which also have an additional program with waivers for more nationalities; American Samoa has a similar but separate program.

The countries selected for the VWP by the U.S. government are generally regarded as developed countries, with high-income economies and a very high Human Development Index.

Other visa waivers exist for citizens of some neighboring or associated countries and territories.

==Eligible countries==
To be eligible for a visa waiver under the VWP, the traveler seeking admission to the United States must be a national of a country that has been designated by the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, as a &quot;program country&quot;. Permanent residents of designated countries who are not their nationals do not qualify for a visa waiver. The criteria for designation as program countries are specified in Section 217(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (). The criteria stress passport security, a visitor visa refusal rate below 3%, and a reciprocal visa waiver for U.S. nationals, among other requirements.

As of 2025, nationals of 43 countries are eligible for entry into the United States without a visa under the VWP:

==Requirements==
===Passport===
All visitors from VWP countries must hold a biometric passport.

All travelers must have individual passports. It is not acceptable (for the VWP) for children to be included on a parent&#x27;s passport.

In principle, the passport must be valid for six months beyond the expected date of departure from the United States. However, the United States has agreements with a large number of countries to waive this requirement, including all VWP countries except Brunei.

===Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA)===
All incoming passengers who intend to take advantage of the Visa Waiver Program are required to apply for a travel authorization through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) online before departure to the United States, preferably at least 72 hours (3 days) in advance. This requirement was announced on June 3, 2008 and is intended to bolster U.S. security by pre-screening participating VWP passengers against terrorist or no-fly lists and databases. It is similar to Australia&#x27;s Electronic Travel Authority system. The authorization is mandatory for participating VWP nationals before traveling to the United States, but as with formal visas this does not guarantee admission into the United States since final admission eligibility is determined at U.S. ports of entry by CBP officers.

ESTA has an application fee of 4 USD, and if approved, an additional fee of 17 USD is charged, for a total of 21 USD. An approved ESTA is valid for up to two years or until the traveler&#x27;s passport expires, whichever comes first, and is valid for multiple entries into the United States.

When traveling to the United States by air or sea under the VWP with ESTA, the person must be traveling on a participating commercial carrier and hold a valid return or onward ticket, dated within 90 days. The VWP does not apply at all (i.e. a visa is required) if a passenger arrives via air or sea on an unapproved carrier. ESTA is also required for travel by land.

===Prior travel or dual nationality in certain countries===
Since 2016, those who have previously been in Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria or Yemen on or after March 1, 2011, or in Cuba on or after January 12, 2021, or who are dual nationals of Cuba, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Sudan or Syria, are not eligible to travel under the VWP. However, those who traveled to such countries for diplomatic, military, humanitarian, reporting or legitimate business purposes may have this ineligibility waived by the Secretary of Homeland Security.

===Other requirements===
Applicants for admission under the Visa Waiver Program:
* Must have complied with the conditions of all previous admissions to the United States and have not been found ineligible for a U.S. visa.
* Must never have been convicted of, or arrested for, an offense or crime involving moral turpitude or a controlled substance, or two or more crimes with a maximum aggregate sentence of five years&#x27; imprisonment or more, no matter how long ago. National regulations which normally expunge criminal records after a certain length of time (e.g. the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 in the UK) do not apply.
* Must not be otherwise inadmissible to the United States, such as on health or national security grounds.
* Must be intending to visit the United States for a purpose of tourism, business or transit.

Applicants should display social and economic ties which bind them to their country of origin or may be refused entry.

Having been arrested or convicted does not in itself make a person ineligible to use the Visa Waiver Program. However, some U.S. embassies advise such persons to apply for a tourist visa even though there is no legal obligation to do so.

Those who do not meet the requirements for the Visa Waiver Program must obtain a U.S. visitor visa from a U.S. embassy or consulate.

===Restrictions===
Visitors under the VWP may stay for up to 90 days in the United States and cannot request an extension of the original allowed period of stay (this practice is allowed to those holding regular visas). However, VWP visitors may seek to adjust status on the basis of either marriage to a U.S. citizen or an application for asylum.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers determine admissibility upon the traveler&#x27;s arrival. If one seeks to enter the United States under the VWP and is denied entry by a CBP officer at a port of entry, there is no path to appeal or review of the denial of entry.

Travelers can leave to neighboring jurisdictions (Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean), but will not be granted another 90 days after reentry in the United States; instead they are readmitted to the United States for the remaining days granted on their initial entry. Transit through the United States is generally permitted, if the total time in the United States, Canada, Mexico and adjacent islands is less than 90 days. However, if for example the traveler is transiting the United States on the way to a 6-month stay in Canada, the VWP cannot be used, as the total time in the United States, Canada, Mexico and adjacent islands will be over 90 days. In this case the traveler should apply for a B-1/B-2 visa, or a transit visa.

There are restrictions on the type of employment-related activities allowed. Meetings and conferences in relation to the travelers&#x27; profession, line of business or employer in their home country are generally acceptable, but most forms of &quot;gainful employment&quot; are not. There are however poorly-classifiable exceptions such as persons performing professional services in the United States for a non-U.S. employer, and persons installing, servicing and repairing commercial or industrial equipment or machinery pursuant to a contract of sale. Performers (such as actors and musicians) who plan on performing live or taping scenes for productions in their country of origin, as well as athletes participating in an athletic event, are likewise not allowed to use the VWP for their respective engagements and are instead required to have an O or P visa prior to arrival. Foreign media representatives and journalists on assignment are required to have a nonimmigrant media (I) visa.

==History==
Congress passed legislation in 1986 to create the Visa Waiver Program with the aim of facilitating tourism and short-term business visits to the United States, and allowing the United States Department of State to focus consular resources on addressing higher risks. The United Kingdom became the first country to participate in the Visa Waiver Program in July 1988, followed by Japan in December 1988. In July 1989, France, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and West Germany were added to the VWP.

In 1991, more European countries joined the Program – Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, Norway, San Marino and Spain – as well as New Zealand (the first country from Oceania). In 1993, Brunei became the second Asian country to be admitted to the Program.

On April 1, 1995, Ireland was added to the VWP. In 1996, Australia and Argentina (the first Latin American country) joined, although Argentina was later removed in 2002. On September 30, 1997, Slovenia was added. On August 9, 1999, Portugal, Singapore and Uruguay joined the program, although Uruguay was subsequently removed in 2003.

Following the September 11 terrorist attacks, the George W. Bush administration decided to tighten entry requirements into the United States, as a result of which legislation was passed requiring foreign visitors entering under the Visa Waiver Program to present a machine-readable passport upon arrival starting from October 1, 2003, and a biometric passport from October 26, 2004. However, as a number of VWP countries still issued non-machine readable passports (for example, more than a third of French and Spanish passport holders held a non-machine readable version), the implementation of this rule was postponed to October 26, 2004, with the exception of Belgian nationals, as there were concerns about the security and integrity of Belgian passports. Likewise, the biometric passport requirement was also postponed to October 26, 2005, only to be further postponed by another year to October 26, 2006 at the request of the European Union, which raised concerns about the number of participating countries which would have been able to make the deadline. When the new rule came into force on that day, three countries (Andorra, Brunei and Liechtenstein) had not yet started issuing biometric passports.

In November 2006, the U.S. government announced that plans for an &quot;Electronic Travel Authorization&quot; program (officially named &quot;Electronic System for Travel Authorization&quot;) would be developed so that VWP travelers can give advance information on their travels to the United States. In return, they will be given authorization electronically to travel to the United States, although it does not guarantee admission to the United States. This program is modeled on the Electronic Travel Authority scheme that has been used in Australia for many years.

Argentina&#x27;s participation in the VWP was terminated in 2002 in light of the financial crisis taking place in that country and its potential effect on mass emigration and unlawful overstay of its nationals in the United States by way of the VWP. Uruguay&#x27;s participation in the program was revoked in 2003 for similar reasons. While a country&#x27;s political and economic standing does not directly determine its eligibility, it is widely believed that nationals of politically stable and economically developed nations would not have much incentive to illegally seek employment and violate their visa while in the United States, risks that consular officers seriously consider in approving or denying a visa.

===Road map===
After the 2004 enlargement of the European Union, both the newly admitted countries and EU agencies began intensive lobbying efforts to include those new countries in the VWP. The U.S. government initially responded to those efforts by developing bilateral strategies with 19 candidate countries known as the Visa Waiver road map process. The U.S. government began to accept the possibility of departing from the original country designation criteria – which had been contained within immigration law &quot;per se&quot; – and to expand them by adding political criteria, with the latter being able to override the former. This development began first with Bill S.2844 which explicitly named Poland as the only country to be added to the VWP, and continued as an amendment to the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 (S.2611), whose Sec. 413, Visa Waiver Program Expansion, defined broader criteria that would apply to any EU country that provided &quot;material support&quot; to the multinational forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. However, the definition of that &quot;material support&quot; would be met again only by Poland and Romania, a fact that was not favorably received by the other EU candidate countries.

During his visit to Estonia in November 2006, President Bush announced his intention &quot;to work with our Congress and our international partners to modify our visa waiver program&quot;. In 2006, the Secure Travel and Counterterrorism Partnership Bill was introduced in the Senate but no action was taken and that bill, as well as a similar one introduced in the House the following year, died after two years of inactivity. The bill would have directed the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish a pilot program to expand the visa waiver program for up to five new countries that were cooperating with the United States on security and counterterrorism matters.

A June 2007 Hudson Institute Panel stressed the urgency of the inclusion of Central Europe in the VWP: &quot;An inexplicable policy that is causing inestimable damage to the United States with its new Central and Eastern European NATO allies is the region&#x27;s exclusion from the visa waiver program. As Helle Dale wrote in the spring issue of European Affairs: &quot;Meanwhile, the problem is fueling anti-U.S. antagonisms and a perception of capricious discrimination by U.S. bureaucrats ---and damping the visits to the United States of people from countries with whom Washington would like to improve commercial and intellectual ties. Meanwhile, horror stories abound from friends and diplomats from Central and Eastern Europe about the problems besetting foreigners seeking to visit the United States. In fact bringing up the subject of visas with any resident of those countries is like waving a red flag before a bull.&quot; Visa waiver must be satisfactorily addressed and resolved at long last.&quot;

The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 allowed the inclusion of new countries in the VWP with a visa refusal rate up to 10% (up from the standard requirement of 3%) if they satisfied certain other conditions, from October 2008. With the relaxed criteria, eight countries were added to the program: Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia and South Korea in November 2008, and Malta in December 2008. Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek called it &quot;a removal of the last relict of Communism and the Cold War&quot;. However, from July 2009, the authority to include countries with such higher visa refusal rate became conditioned on the implementation of a system capable of matching the entry and exit from the United States of travelers under the VWP using biometric identifiers. As such system was not implemented, the visa refusal rate requirement returned to 3%.

Greece officially joined the program on April 5, 2010.

On October 2, 2012, Secretary Janet Napolitano announced the inclusion of Taiwan into the program effective on November 1, 2012. Only holders of passports with a national identification number would benefit from the visa waiver.

In 2013 there was conflict over the United States-Israel Strategic Partnership Act of 2013 whose Senate version specified that satisfaction of the requirements regarding reciprocal travel privileges for U.S. nationals would be subject to security concerns. Many members of the House of Representatives opposed the security language because it seemed to validate Israel&#x27;s tendency to turn away Arab Americans without giving any reason. None of the other 37 countries in the visa waiver program had such an exemption.

Chief Executive of Hong Kong Donald Tsang raised the issue of allowing holders of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passports or British National (Overseas) passports to participate in the VWP during his visit to the United States in 2011, but proposals to allow this have not been successful.

Hong Kong is the only jurisdiction with a higher Human Development Index than the United States whose citizens cannot enjoy the program. The visa refusal rate for Hong Kong dropped to 1.7% for HKSAR passport and 2.6% for British National (Overseas) passport in 2012. Hong Kong met all VWP criteria but did not qualify at the time because it was not legally a separate country, despite having its own passports and independent judicial system, monetary system and immigration control. The former Chief Executive of Hong Kong, Donald Tsang, raised the issue with then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during his visit to the United States in 2011 and was met with positive response. On May 16, 2013, a bipartisan amendment bill was passed by the Senate Judiciary Committee but not ratified into law. On August 10, 2015, the U.S. Consul General to Hong Kong and Macau, Clifford Hart, said during an interview with South China Morning Post that the visa waiver was &quot;not happening anytime soon&quot;, as the Visa Waiver law required the participant to be a &quot;sovereign state&quot; and Hong Kong was not independent, thus ending the possibility of Hong Kong joining the program. He also denied that the failed lobbying effort of the HKSAR government on this issue was a result of the refusal of detaining Edward Snowden in 2013.

Chile joined the VWP on March 31, 2014.

In 2014, the European Union pressured the United States to extend the Visa Waiver Program to its five member states that were not yet included in it (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Poland and Romania). In November 2014, the Bulgarian government announced that it would not ratify the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership unless the United States lifted the visa requirement for its nationals. Due to incomplete U.S. reciprocity, in March 2017 the European Parliament approved a non-binding resolution calling on the European Commission to suspend the visa exemption for U.S. nationals to travel the Schengen Area. On May 2, 2017, the European Commission decided not act on the resolution and hoped to restart full visa reciprocity negotiations for the remaining EU member states with the new U.S. administration.

In December 2018, ESTA was no longer processed in real time, and travelers were advised to apply at least 72 hours before departure.

In July 2019, U.S. Ambassador to Poland Georgette Mosbacher stated that &quot;Poland would fully qualify for the Visa Waiver Program within 3 to 6 months after September 2019&quot; depending on bureaucratic procedures. On October 4, 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed that the Department of State had formally nominated Poland for entry into the Visa Waiver Program. On November 11, 2019 Poland officially joined the Program and became its 39th member.

On February 12, 2021, U.S. Embassy in Croatia&#x27;s Chargé d&#x27;Affaires Victoria Taylor announced on Twitter that the refusal rate for business and tourist visas in Croatia in 2020 dropped to 2.69%, marking a step forward for Croatia to join the VWP &quot;in the near future.&quot; On August 2, 2021, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced that Croatia had been formally nominated to join the VWP. On September 28, 2021, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas officially announced that Croatia would join the VWP before December 1, 2021. Croatia joined the VWP on October 23, 2021.

In October 2020, the European Parliament repeated its request for the European Commission to suspend the visa exemption for U.S. nationals, and in March 2021, it filed a judicial action against the European Commission for its failure to act on the subject. In September 2023, the Court of Justice of the European Union dismissed the judicial action brought by the European Parliament, ruling that the European Commission was not obligated to suspend the visa exemption for U.S. nationals.

On March 15, 2023, Democratic senator Dick Durbin introduced a bill that would allow including Romania in the VWP regardless of the program requirements. 

On July 6, 2023, the validity of new ESTA applications by nationals of Brunei was reduced to one year.

On September 27, 2023, Israel was designated to join the VWP by November 30, 2023. Israel joined the VWP on October 19, 2023.

On September 24, 2024, Qatar was designated to join the VWP by December 1, 2024. Qatar joined the VWP on November 21, 2024.

In December 2023, during a visit to the United States, Romanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu said that Romania&#x27;s entry into the U.S. visa-free program would be announced in 2024, ahead of the 2025 deadline discussed with the U.S. representatives. On January 10, 2025, it was announced that Romania would join the VWP by March 31, 2025.

===Hungary===
In October 2017, U.S. officials discovered a massive passport fraud scheme in Hungary, in which hundreds of non-Hungarians obtained genuine Hungarian passports. A U.S. Department of Homeland Security report (obtained by the &quot;Washington Post&quot; and reported in May 2018) showed that of approximately 700 non-Hungarians who had obtained the passports, 85 had attempted to travel to the United States under false identites, 65 had been admitted to the United States through the VWP, and (as of October 2017) approximately 30 remained in the United States despite the efforts of U.S. authorities to locate and deport them. The fraud was enabled by a policy implemented in 2011 by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán; under the policy, the Hungarian government provided passports to ethnic Hungarians living outside Hungary, who could prove that one of their ancestors was a Hungarian citizen, with the goal of expediting naturalization. More than a million people obtained Hungarian citizenship through the program. Because the program lacked stringent identity-verification procedures, it was abused by bad actors, including criminals and applicants who used forged documents to falsely claim Hungarian descent. Some who received Hungarian passports under the program were criminals without any connection to Hungary.

U.S. officials were alarmed by the risks created by the program, including the risk that the passports might be used in drug smuggling, organized crime, illegal immigration, espionage, or terrorism. In October 2017, the U.S. government downgraded Hungary&#x27;s status in the VWP to &quot;provisional&quot; and sought to develop a &quot;cooperative action plan&quot; within 45 days. U.S. and Hungarian officials engaged in a dialogue for several years on resolving the security risks, but Hungarian authorities failed to resolve the issues to the U.S. government&#x27;s satisfaction. As a result, beginning in 2020 and 2021, the U.S. government barred Hungarian passport-holders who were not born in Hungary from obtaining ESTA pre-travel authorizations. In August 2023, the U.S. government imposed additional restrictions on Hungary&#x27;s participation in the VWP: the ESTA validity period for Hungarian passport-holders was reduced from two years to one year, and each ESTA on a Hungarian passport would be valid for only one entry to the United States.

===Aspiring countries===
Of the 19 road map countries listed in 2007, 12 have been admitted to the VWP. In 2024, the U.S. government cited six countries aspiring to join the VWP:

Turkey, the remaining road map country listed in 2007, was no longer cited as an aspiring country in 2024. Chile, Croatia and Qatar were not listed as road map countries in 2007 but were later admitted to the VWP.

Cyprus, Nauru, Romania, United Arab Emirates, Uruguay and Vatican City had a visa refusal rate lower than 3% in fiscal year 2024, satisfying a critical requirement to join the VWP.

==U.S. territories==
The Visa Waiver Program applies to all permanently inhabited U.S. territories except American Samoa.

===Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands===
Although the U.S. Visa Waiver Program also applies to the U.S. territories of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands, and therefore nationals of VWP countries may travel to these territories with an ESTA, both territories have an additional visa waiver program for certain nationalities. The Guam–CNMI Visa Waiver Program, first enacted in October 1988 and periodically amended, permits nationals of 12 countries to travel to Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands for up to 45 days, and nationals of China to travel to the Northern Mariana Islands for up to 14 days, for tourism or business, without the need to obtain a U.S. visa. This program also requires an electronic travel authorization similar to ESTA but without a fee.

===American Samoa===
U.S. visa policy does not apply to American Samoa, as it has its own entry requirements and maintains control of its own borders. Hence, neither a U.S. visa nor an ESTA can be used to enter American Samoa. If required, an entry permit or electronic authorization must be obtained from the Department of Legal Affairs of American Samoa.

Nationals of Canada, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Palau, and countries in the U.S. Visa Waiver Program (except Qatar and Romania) may visit American Samoa for up to 30 days without an entry permit. However, if arriving by air, they must apply online for an electronic authorization called &quot;OK Board&quot;, at least 3 business days before travel, for a fee of 40 USD. Nationals of Samoa may also apply for a similar electronic authorization to visit American Samoa for up to 10 days, for a fee of 10 USD.

Nationals of other countries need an entry permit, which must be requested by a local sponsor at the Immigration Office of the Department of Legal Affairs of American Samoa.

==Statistics==
===Admissions===
===Visa refusal rate===
To qualify for the Visa Waiver Program, a country must have had a visa refusal rate of less than 3% for the previous year. This refusal rate is based on applications for B visas, for tourism and business purposes. B visas are adjudicated based on applicant interviews, which generally last between 60 and 90 seconds.

===Overstay rate===
The table below shows the overstay rate, which is the portion of visitors arriving under the Visa Waiver Program who remained in the United States longer than the maximum allowed stay of 90 days. Some of these visitors later left the United States or legalized their immigration status.

==Other visa waivers==
===Nationals of neighboring jurisdictions===
Separate from the Visa Waiver Program, permits the Attorney General and the Secretary of State (acting jointly) to waive visa requirements for admission to the United States in nonimmigrant status for nationals of foreign contiguous territories or adjacent islands or for residents of those territories or islands who have a common nationality with those nationals. The regulations relating to such admissions can be found at .

Under this provision, nationals of the following jurisdictions may travel to the United States without a visa:
*Nationals of the Bahamas do not need a visa to travel to the United States if they apply for admission at a U.S. preclearance facility located in the Bahamas. Applicants 14 years of age or older must present a certificate issued by the Royal Bahamas Police Force indicating no criminal record.
*British Overseas Territories citizens of Bermuda do not need a visa to visit the United States under most circumstances for up to 180 days.
*British Overseas Territories citizens of the British Virgin Islands may travel without a visa to the U.S. Virgin Islands. They may also continue travel to other parts of the United States if they present a certificate issued by the Royal Virgin Islands Police Force indicating no criminal record.
*Canadian citizens do not need a visa to visit the United States under most circumstances. In addition, under the USMCA (and earlier NAFTA), they may obtain authorization to work under a simplified procedure.
*British Overseas Territories citizens of the Cayman Islands do not need a visa if they travel directly from the territory to the United States and present a certificate issued by the Royal Cayman Islands Police Service indicating no criminal record.
*Some nationals of Mexico do not need a visa to travel to the United States: government officials not permanently assigned to the United States and their accompanying family members, holding diplomatic or official passports, for stays of up to six months; members of the Kickapoo tribes of Texas or Oklahoma, holding Form I-872, American Indian Card; and crew members of Mexican airlines operating in the United States. Other nationals of Mexico may travel to the United States with a Border Crossing Card, which functions as a visa and has similar requirements. Under the USMCA (and earlier NAFTA), they may also obtain authorization to work under a simplified procedure.
*British Overseas Territories citizens of the Turks and Caicos Islands do not need a visa if they travel directly from the territory to the United States and present a certificate issued by the Royal Turks and Caicos Islands Police Force indicating no criminal record.

Restrictions on the use of the Visa Waiver Program do not affect this class of travelers unless separately provided for by statute or regulation. For example, a Canadian citizen who has briefly overstayed a previous visit to the United States (by less than 180 days) will still not require a visa for future visits, while a VWP national who overstays will become ineligible for the VWP for life and will need a visa for future visits. ESTA is not required from British Overseas Territories citizens using one of the above waivers with the respective territory&#x27;s passport, but it is required if they use the VWP with a British citizen passport.

Until 2003, this visa waiver was granted not only to nationals of those countries and territories, but also to permanent residents of Bermuda and Canada who were nationals of countries in the Commonwealth of Nations or Ireland.

===Citizens of freely associated states===
Under Compacts of Free Association, citizens of the following countries may enter, reside, study and work in the United States indefinitely without a visa. These benefits are granted to citizens from birth or independence, and to naturalized citizens who have resided in the respective country for at least five years, excluding those who acquired citizenship by investment.

<text>James Dawson Chichester-Clark, Baron Moyola (12 February 1923 – 17 May 2002) was the penultimate Prime Minister of Northern Ireland and eighth leader of the Ulster Unionist Party between 1969 and March 1971. He was Member of the Northern Ireland Parliament for South Londonderry for 12 years, beginning at the by-election to replace his grandmother, Dame Dehra Parker in 1960. He stopped being an MP when the Stormont Parliament was suspended and subsequently abolished with the introduction of Direct Rule by the British Government.

Chichester-Clark&#x27;s election as UUP leader resulted from the sudden resignation of Terence O&#x27;Neill after the ambiguous result of the preceding general election. His term in office was dominated by both internal unionist struggles, seeing the political emergence of Ian Paisley from the right and Alliance Party of Northern Ireland from the left, and an emergent Irish nationalist resurgence. In March 1971, with his health suffering under the strain of the growing political strife, he resigned, having failed to secure extra military resources from the British Government.

==Family background and early life==
Chichester-Clark was born as James Dawson Clark at Moyola Park, Castledawson, County Londonderry, his family&#x27;s ancestral home. He was the eldest of three children of James Lenox-Conyngham Clark and Marion Caroline Dehra, née Chichester. His brother was Robin Chichester-Clark and his sister, Penelope Hobhouse, the garden writer and historian.

In 1924, James Clark Snr. changed the family name to &quot;Chichester-Clark&quot; by deed poll, thus preventing the old Protestant Ascendancy name Chichester (his wife&#x27;s maiden name) from dying out. On his mother&#x27;s side the family are descended from the Donegall Chichesters and were the heirs of the Dawsons of Castledawson, who had originally held Moyola Park.

Educated, against his own wishes, at Selwyn House, Broadstairs, and then Eton, Chichester-Clark left school and entered adulthood in the midst of the Second World War. On joining the Irish Guards, the regiment of his grandfather, in Omagh he began his year-long training at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, before receiving his commission as a second lieutenant.

He married widow Moyra Haughton (née Morris) in 1959. Lady Moyola&#x27;s first husband, Capt. Thomas Haughton from Cullybackey (he was part of the linen firm of Frazer &amp; Haughton), had been killed in the Nutts Corner air crash – in which she, whilst pregnant, was seriously injured and suffered a broken neck. They had two daughters (Tara and Fiona), in addition to Moyra&#x27;s son Michael from her previous marriage. Lady Moyola was a cousin of Colonel Sir Michael McCorkell, Lord-Lieutenant of County Londonderry 1975–2000, Lord Moyola served as his Vice Lord-Lieutenant.

==Military career==
Chichester-Clark was an officer in the 1st Battalion, Irish Guards, part of 24th Guards Brigade attached to British 1st Infantry Division, and participated briefly in the Anzio landings. He was injured on 23 February 1944 by an 88m shell as he and his Platoon Sergeant took their first look at the ground in the &#x27;gullies&#x27; to the west of the Anzio-Albano road. His company were all but wiped out, and he spent most of his war in hospital recovering from injuries, the effects of which stayed with him throughout his life. Following the war, his military career took him from the dull duties of the post-war occupation of Germany, to Canada as aide-de-camp to Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis, then Governor General of Canada. The popularity and competence of his senior officer made this uneventful two-year period of Chichester-Clark&#x27;s life the most remarkable element of his pre-parliamentary career. On returning from Canada, Chichester-Clark continued in the Army for several years, refusing promotion to seniority before retiring a major in 1960.

==Political life==
In an uncontested by-election in 1960, he took over the South Londonderry seat in the Northern Ireland Parliament held by his grandmother, Dame Dehra Parker, since 1933. As Dehra Chichester, she had been an MP for the county of Londonderry until 1929 when she stood down for a first time. Chichester-Clark&#x27;s father, replaced her in 1929 when the county was split, but he suddenly died in 1933. Dehra, by then remarried, willingly returned to Northern Ireland from England, and won the ensuing by-election.

He retained the seat for the remainder of the Parliament&#x27;s existence, and so the South Londonderry area was represented by three generations of the same family for the entire period of the Northern Ireland House of Commons. Between 1929 and the last election in 1969, the family was challenged for the seat on only two occasions, the second being in 1969, when future Westminster MP Bernadette Devlin stood, attracting 39% of the vote

Chichester-Clark made his maiden speech on 8 February 1961 during the Queen&#x27;s speech debate.

==Minister==
For the remainder of Lord Brookeborough&#x27;s premiership, Chichester-Clark remained on the back benches. It was not until 1963, when Terence O&#x27;Neill became Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, that Chichester-Clark was appointed assistant whip, and a month later when Bill Craig was promoted to the Ministry of Home Affairs, Chichester-Clark took over as Government Chief Whip. Accounts of the period are that Chichester-Clark enjoyed the Whip&#x27;s office more than any other he was to subsequently hold in politics. This despite including references to anti O&#x27;Neill MP and future DUP Westminster MP, Johnny McQuade, and the occasional &quot;good row&quot;. From the outset, O&#x27;Neill took the unusual decision to allow Chichester-Clark to attend and speak at all cabinet meetings while Chief Whip. Proving a competent parliamentary party administrator, O&#x27;Neill added Leader of the House of Commons to Chichester-Clark&#x27;s duties in October 1966, a promotion that made him a full member of the Cabinet. He was also sworn into the Privy Council of Northern Ireland in 1966.

In 1967, O&#x27;Neill sacked his Minister of Agriculture, Harry West, for ministerial impropriety, and Chichester-Clark was appointed in his place, a position he retained for two quiet years. On 23 April 1969, he resigned from the Cabinet one day prior to a crucial Parliamentary Party meeting, claiming that he disagreed with the Prime Minister&#x27;s decision to grant universal suffrage in local government elections at that time. He stated that he disagreed not with the principle of one man one vote but with the timing of the decision, having the previous day expressed doubts over the expediency of the measure in Cabinet. It has since been suggested that his resignation was in order to accelerate O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s own resignation, and to improve his own position in the jostling to succeed him.

O&#x27;Neill &quot;finally walked away&quot; five days later on 28 April 1969. In order to beat his only serious rival, Brian Faulkner, Chichester-Clark needed the backing of O&#x27;Neill-ite MPs elected at the 1969 Northern Ireland general election, to which end he attended a tea party in O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s honour only days after he had caused his resignation.

==Prime minister==
He beat Faulkner in the 1969 Ulster Unionist Party leadership election by one vote on 1 May 1969, with his predecessor using his casting vote in the tied election for his distant cousin because &quot;Faulkner had been stabbing him in the back for a lot longer&quot;. Although Faulkner believed, until his death, that he had been the victim of an upper-class conspiracy to deny him the premiership, he became a high profile and loyal member of Chichester-Clark&#x27;s cabinet.

His premiership was punctuated by the civil unrest that erupted after August 1969. He suffered from the effects of the Hunt Report, which recommended the disbandment of the Ulster Special Constabulary, which his Government accepted to the consternation of many Unionists.

In April 1970 his predecessor and another Unionist MP resigned their seats in the NI House of Commons. The by-election campaigns were punctuated by major liberal speeches by senior government figures like Brian Faulkner, Jack Andrews and the Prime Minister himself. Ian Paisley&#x27;s Protestant Unionist Party, however, took both seats in the House of Commons. Later the same month the O&#x27;Neill-ite group, the New Ulster Movement, became the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, and his party began passing votes of no confidence in him.

As the civil unrest grew, the British Government, particularly the Home Secretary, James Callaghan, became increasingly involved in Northern Ireland&#x27;s affairs, forcing Chichester-Clark&#x27;s hand on many issues. These included the disbanding of the &#x27;B&#x27; Specials and, importantly, the handing over of operational control of the security forces to the Army General Officer Commanding Northern Ireland.

==Resignation and beyond==
On 9 March 1971 the IRA lured three off-duty soldiers from a pub in Belfast to a lane way outside the city, where they killed them. Chichester-Clark flew to London on 18 March 1971 to request a new security initiative from the new British prime minister Edward Heath, who offered an extra 1,300 troops, and resisted what he saw was an attempt by Chichester-Clark to gain political control over them. Chichester-Clark resigned on 20 March. In his resignation statement he stated:
::I have decided to resign because I can see no other way of bringing home to all concerned the realities of the present constitutional, political and security situation... It is apparent that public and parliamentary opinion in Northern Ireland looks to the Northern Ireland government for measures which can bring the current IRA campaign swiftly to an end. I have expressed to British Ministers the full force of this opinion and have pressed upon them my view that some further initiative is required. While they have agreed to take any feasible steps open to them to intensify the effort against the IRA, it remains the professional military view – and one which I indeed have often expressed myself – that it would be misleading the Northern Ireland community to suggest that we are faced with anything but a long haul, and that such initiatives as can be taken are unlikely to effect a radical improvement in the short term...

He agreed to tone down his statement so as to smooth the way for his successor. The Unionist Party internal newspaper, the &quot;Ulster Times&quot; in April 1971 carried a &quot;respectful political obituary&quot;, which &quot;condemned those who attacked Catholics in their homes&quot;:

On 23 March 1971, Brian Faulkner was elected UUP leader in a vote by Unionist MP&#x27;s, defeating William Craig by twenty-six votes to four. He was appointed prime minister the same day.

==Peerage and later life==
On 20 July 1971 Chichester-Clark was created a life peer as Baron Moyola, of Castledawson in the County of Londonderry, his title taken from the name of his family&#x27;s estate. He endorsed the Belfast Agreement in the 1998 referendum. 
Lord Moyola remained quiet about his political career in his retirement. Lady Moyola, however, has said that her husband did enjoy the time – contrary to popular opinion – and that he thought of life as an MP as akin to that of an army welfare officer.

He was Vice-Lord Lieutenant of County Londonderry from 1975 to 1993.

Lord Moyola died on 17 May 2002 at the age of 79; he was the last surviving Prime Minister of Northern Ireland.

<text>The education system in the former state of Czechoslovakia built on previous provision, which included compulsory education and was adapted in some respects to the ethnic diversity of the region. During the Communist period further progress was made in the school system towards equality in opportunity between regions and genders, but access to higher education depended upon the political compliance of students and their families. After the &#x27;Velvet Revolution&#x27; in 1989 many reforms were introduced.

==Before the Communist era==
Czechoslovakia (and its succession states) had a tradition of academic and scholarly endeavor in the mainstream of European thought and a history of higher education dating from the Middle Ages. Charles University was founded in Prague in 1348, and the Universitas Istropolitana (Academia Istropolitana) was founded in Bratislava in 1465.

Before World War I, education was the chief instrument for dealing with ethnic diversity. Perhaps in no other aspect of public life did Czechoslovakia more effectively address the disparities among Czechs, Slovaks, Hungarians, Ukrainians, and Germans. Eight years of compulsory education in the native language of each ethnic minority did much to raise literacy rates, particularly among Slovaks and Ukrainians. An expanded program of vocational education increased the technical skills of the country&#x27;s growing industrial labor force. Some disparities remained, however. Germans and Czechs predominated disproportionately in secondary schools and universities. Both in the Czech lands and in Slovakia, compulsory education, had begun in 1774, on the initiative of Maria Theresa. In the Czech lands, prosperous farmers and even cottagers and tenants had a long history of boarding their children in towns or cities for secondary, vocational, and higher education.

==In the Communist era ==
Despite regional and ethnic imbalances, Czechoslovakia entered the Communist era with a literate, even highly educated, populace. Education under Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSC) rule has a history of periodic reforms (often attempting to fit the Soviet model) and efforts to maintain ideological purity within schools. At the same time, higher education was a reward for political compliance. By the mid-1970s, the historical disparity in educational resources between the Czech lands and Slovakia had been largely redressed. A certain equity in educational opportunity was achieved, partly through the concerted efforts of policy makers and partly through the vicissitudes of normalization.

===System===
In the 1980s, the Czechoslovak education system had four basic levels: 
*nursery and kindergarten;
* 8-year primary schools; (until 1978: 9 years)
*various kinds of secondary schools; and
*a variety of institutions of higher education.

Education was compulsory between the ages of six and sixteen from 1984 (i.e. 10 years, 1922-1948: 8 years, 1948-1984: 9 years). In 1974-75 planners began an education reform, shortening the primary cycle from nine to eight years and standardizing curricula within the secondary-school system. The state financed education, and all textbooks and instructional material below the university level were free (returned at the end of the semester).

&quot;Secondary schools&quot; included gymnasia (stressing general education and preparation for higher education) and vocational schools (which emphasized technical training); both were four-year programs. A highly developed apprenticeship program and a system of secondary vocational or professional programs were attached to specific industries or industrial plants. In both secondary and higher education, provision was made for workers to attend evening study in combination with work-release time.

In 1985 there were 36 &quot;universities&quot; or university-level institutions of higher education, comprising 110 faculties; 23 were located in the Czech Socialist Republic, and 13 were located in the Slovak Socialist Republic. The mid-1970s reform shortened the course of study in most fields from five to four years. A 1980 law on higher education increased the control of the Czech and Slovak ministries of education over universities and technical colleges. Postgraduate study involved three to six years of study. Faculties could exist within a university system or as independent entities (as in the case of the six theological faculties under the direction of both republics&#x27; ministries of culture, or educational faculties sometimes administered directly by the republics&#x27; ministries of education).

The regime made intensive efforts to improve the educational status of &quot;women&quot; in the 1970s. The number of women who completed a course of higher education jumped by 93 percent between 1970 and 1980 (for men the increase was 48 percent). Although women continued to cluster in such traditionally female areas of employment as health care and teaching, their enrollment in many secondary schools outstripped that of men. Women have accounted for 40 percent of university enrollment since the mid-1960s. In the 1985–86 school year, this figure was 43 percent.

===Admission===
Educational enrollment and admissions were delicate matters during the socialist era. Virtually everyone attended primary school, and a majority of those of secondary-school age attended some kind of specialized training or a gymnasium. Beyond this, however, the questions surrounding university admissions (and who attends secondary schools and who becomes an apprentice) took on political overtones. In the 1950s the children of political prisoners, well-to-do farmers, or known adherents of one or another religion were victims of the party&#x27;s discriminatory admissions policies. Youngsters of working-class or peasant background ostensibly had preference over those of other socioeconomic groups. However, a look at students&#x27; backgrounds during the 1950s and 1960s reveals that in no year did children of workers or peasants constitute a majority of those in institutions of higher education. Precise estimates vary, but through the mid-1960s workers&#x27; families gained an average of one-third of the admission slots, peasants a mere 10 percent, and &quot;others&quot; nearly 60 percent. The proletariat fared better in Slovakia, where nearly half of those with secondary school or university degrees came from workers&#x27; or peasants&#x27; families.

In 1971 the regime announced that &quot;The selection of applicants must clearly be political in character. . . . We make no secret of the fact that we want to do this at the schools in a manner that will guarantee that future graduates will be supporters of socialism and that they will place their knowledge at the service of socialist society.&quot; This was the &quot;principled class approach,&quot; a complex set of criteria that purportedly reflected a student&#x27;s &quot;talent, interest in the chosen field, class origins, civic and moral considerations, social and political activism of the parents, and the result of the admission examination.&quot; In practice, class background and parents&#x27; political activities outweighed all other factors. Children of dissidents, of those in political disfavor, or of open adherents of a religious sect were denied admission to higher education in favor of children whose parents were party members or who were of proletarian origin.

Amnesty International reported in 1980 that institutions ranked applicants according to the following criteria: students whose parents were both KSC members, children of farmers or workers, and those with one parent a KSC member. Students who failed to meet any of these conditions were considered last. Children of dissidents were effectively disqualified. The system allowed for some manipulation; a member of the intelligentsia without a political blot on his or her record might have taken a job as a worker temporarily to permit his child a claim to proletarian status. There were charges as well of bribes and corruption surrounding university admissions. Whatever the mechanism involved, the social composition of the student body shifted in the mid-1970s; roughly half of all students in higher education were from workers&#x27; or farmers&#x27; families.

Charter 77 protested discrimination in educational admissions based on parents&#x27; political activity; there was some indication by the late 1970s that, if parental sins could still be visited on the children, at least questions concerning their parents&#x27; past and present political affiliations would be less blatant. Whether or not politicizing university admissions ensured that graduates would be &quot;supporters of socialism&quot; could be debated. However, it is evident that in controlling university admissions the regime knew how to ensure acquiescence on the part of most Czechoslovak citizens. If a moderately secure livelihood and a reasonable standard of living were the regime&#x27;s &quot;carrots,&quot; excluding children of dissidents from higher education was one of its more formidable &quot;sticks.&quot;

== 1990 – 1992 ==
After the &#x27;Velvet Revolution&#x27; in 1989 the education system in Czechoslovakia underwent transformative changes. Democratisation of education began in 1990. Private schools and 6- and 8-year general secondary gymnasia were introduced. Academic freedom of higher education was restored and bachelor&#x27;s degree programmes were implemented. In 1992 the first education programmes involving the support of European Commission were launched. Changes were also made to financing of education.

<doc id="421833" wikidata="Q1356189" url="?curid=421833" title="Battle of Potidaea">
<text>The Battle of Potidaea was fought in 432 BC between Athens and a combined army from Corinth and Potidaea, along with their various allies. Along with the Battle of Sybota, it was one of the catalysts for the Peloponnesian War.

== Background ==
Potidaea was a colony of Corinth on the Chalcidice peninsula, but was a member of the Delian League and paid tribute to Athens. It was originally settled by Corinthians and still hosted Corinthian magistrates every year. After the Athenian defeat at Sybota, Athens demanded that Potidaea pull down part of its walls, stop accepting Corinthian magistrates and send hostages to Athens. Athens was afraid that Potidaea would revolt due to Corinthian or Macedonian influence, as Perdiccas II of Macedon was encouraging revolts among Athens&#x27; other allies in Thrace. Whether Potidaea was indeed launching an uprising, the Athenian demands precipitated the revolt. To ensure that its demands were carried out, Athens sent an expedition led by Archestratus within the context of Corinthian and Macedonian hostility.

== Battle ==
Athens gathered a fleet of 30 ships and 1,000 hoplites under the overall command of Archestratus. The Athenian force was originally meant to fight Perdiccas in Macedonia, but was diverted to Potidaea. The Potidaeans sent ambassadors to Athens and Sparta, and when negotiations broke down in Athens, Sparta promised to help Potidaea revolt through a pledge to invade Attica. The Athenian fleet sailed for Potidaea, but when it arrived, Archestratus attacked the Macedonians instead, as the Potidaeans had already revolted and allied with Perdiccas. Corinth sent 1,600 hoplites and 400 light troops to Potidaea as well, under the command of Aristeus, but as &quot;volunteers,&quot; thus hoping not to provoke a larger war. In response, Athens sent out another 2,000 hoplites and 40 more ships, under the command of Callias, son of Calliades. After some fighting against Perdiccas, the combined Athenian forces sailed to Potidaea and landed there. Perdiccas and 200 of his cavalry joined with Aristeus, and their combined army marched to Potidaea.

In the ensuing battle, Aristeus&#x27; wing of Corinthian troops defeated a section of the Athenian line, but elsewhere the Athenians were victorious. Aristeus returned to Potidaea along the sea coast with some difficulty, hoping to avoid the main Athenian army. A reserve force of Potidaeans, located in nearby Olynthus, attempted to relieve Aristeus, but they were also defeated. The Corinthians and Potidaeans lost about 300 men, and the Athenians about 150, including Callias; the Macedonian cavalry did not join the battle.

The Athenians remained outside Potidaea for some time, and were reinforced by another 1,600 hoplites under the command of Phormio. Both sides built walls and counter-walls, and the Athenians succeeded in cutting off Potidaea from the sea with a naval blockade. During the blockade, representatives from Corinth, Athens and Sparta met in Sparta, resulting in a formal declaration of war.

However, this siege, which lasted until 430/429 BC, seriously depleted the Athenian treasury, with as much as 420 talents per year required for the military activity. This was not popular with the Athenians, and in combination with the plague that swept through Athens in the early 420s BC, made the continued leadership of Pericles untenable. The Periclean strategy of hiding behind the Long Walls and relying on the low cash reserves of the Peloponnesians was starting to become unfavourable to the greater Athenian consciousness.

In several of Plato&#x27;s dialogues (Charmides 153a-d, Apology (Plato) 28d), the philosopher Socrates is revealed to be a veteran of the Battle of Potidaea, where he saved the life of Alcibiades (&quot;Symposium&quot; 219e-221b).

<doc id="421835" wikidata="Q2170633" url="?curid=421835" title="United States Department of State list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations">
<text>Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) is a designation for non-United States-based organizations deemed by the United States secretary of state, in accordance with section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 (INA), to be involved in what US authorities define as terrorist activities. Most of the organizations on the list are Islamist extremist groups; the rest are nationalist/separatist groups, Marxist militant groups, drug cartels, or transnational gangs.

The Department of State, along with the United States Department of the Treasury, also has the authority to designate individuals and entities as subject to counter-terrorism sanctions according to Executive Order 13224. The Treasury&#x27;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) maintains a separate list of such individuals and entities.

==Identification of candidates==

The Bureau of Counterterrorism and Countering Violent Extremism (CT) of the United States Department of State continually monitors the activities of groups active around the world to identify targets for the &quot;terrorist&quot; designation. When reviewing potential targets, S/CT looks at the actual attacks that a group has carried out, as well as whether the group has engaged in planning and preparations for possible future acts of violence or retains the capability and intent to carry out such acts.

==Designation process==

Once a target is identified, the Bureau of Counterterrorism and Countering Violent Extremism prepares a detailed &quot;administrative record&quot;, which is a compilation of information, typically including both classified and open sources information, demonstrating that the statutory criteria for designation have been satisfied. If the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury, decides to make the designation, the United States Congress is notified of the Secretary&#x27;s intent to designate the organization and given seven days to review the designation, as the INA requires. Upon the expiration of the seven-day waiting period, notice of the designation is published in the &quot;Federal Register&quot;, at which point the designation takes effect. An organization designated as an FTO may seek judicial review of the designation in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit not later than 30 days after the designation is published in the Federal Register.

Under the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act, the FTO may file a petition for revocation two years after the designation date (or in the case of redesignated FTOs, its most recent redesignation date) or two years after the determination date on its most recent petition for revocation. In order to provide a basis for revocation, the petitioning FTO must provide evidence that the circumstances forming the basis for the designation are sufficiently different as to warrant revocation. If no such review has been conducted during a five-year period with respect to a designation, then the Secretary of State is required to review the designation to determine whether revocation would be appropriate.

The procedural requirements for designating an organization as an FTO also apply to any redesignation of that organization. The Secretary of State may revoke a designation or redesignation at any time upon a finding that the circumstances that were the basis for the designation or redesignation have changed in such a manner as to warrant revocation, or that the national security of the United States warrants a revocation. The same procedural requirements apply to revocations made by the Secretary of State as apply to designations or redesignations. A designation may also be revoked by an Act of Congress, or set aside by a Court order.

==Legal criteria for designation==
(Reflecting Amendments to Section 219 of the INA in the 2001 USA PATRIOT Act)
* It must be a foreign organization.
* The organization must engage in terrorist activity, as defined in section 212 (a)(3)(B) of the INA (8 U.S.C. § 1182(a) (3)(B)),* or terrorism, as defined in section 140(d)(2) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989 (22 U.S.C. § 2656f(d) (2)),** or retain the capability and intent to engage in terrorist activity or terrorism.
* The organization&#x27;s terrorist activity or terrorism must threaten the security of U.S. nationals or the national security (national defense, foreign relations, or the economic interests) of the United States.

==Legal ramifications of designation==
* It is unlawful for a person in the United States or subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to knowingly provide &quot;material support or resources&quot; to a designated FTO. (The term &quot;material support or resources&quot; is defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2339A(b) as &quot;currency or monetary instruments or financial securities, financial services, lodging, training, expert advice or assistance, safehouses, false documentation or identification, communications equipment, facilities, weapons, lethal substances, explosives, personnel, transportation, and other physical assets, except medicine or religious materials.&quot;)
* Representatives and members of a designated FTO, if they are aliens, are inadmissible to and, in certain circumstances, removable from the United States (see 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182 (a)(3)(B)(i)(IV)-(V), 1227 (a)(1)(A)).
* Any U.S. financial institution that becomes aware that it has possession of or control over funds in which a designated FTO or its agent has an interest must retain possession of or control over the funds and report the funds to the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury.

==Other effects of designation==

The U.S. Department of State lists the following items as additional considered beneficial effects of designation:
* Supports efforts to curb terrorism financing and to encourage other nations to do the same.
* Stigmatizes and isolates designated terrorist organizations internationally.
* Deters donations or contributions to and economic transactions with named organizations.
* Heightens public awareness and knowledge of terrorist organizations.
* Signals to other governments U.S. concern about named organizations.

Official designation of a group as a Foreign Terrorist Organization also triggers more robust means of combat under the Authorization for Use of Military Force act enacted in 2001, which is still in force today.

==Groups designated as FTOs==
 the following organizations are designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations:

==Delisted FTOs==
The following groups have been removed from the Department of State&#x27;s list as of December 1, 2021, most due to having been disbanded and thus being no longer active.
==Controversies==

The MEK had been designated a &quot;foreign terrorist organisation&quot; in 1997 in order to improve relations with Tehran and then president Mohammad Khatami. 

In November 2013, the State Department listed the Nigerian terrorist organization Boko Haram as an FTO. In 2014, Republican members of Congress criticized the State Department for not designating the group as an FTO earlier.

In August 2014, the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; reported that U.S. military was coordinating with Kurdish forces in Iraq, including elements of the PKK, seemingly in violation of the ban on assistance to a designated FTO.

<text>From the introduction of the Penny Black by the British postal system, Post Office Circulars have been sent out from the main office, (originally in Edinburgh), to give information and examples of the new postage stamps which were coming into general use.

The original notice regarding the introduction of postage stamps was sent out in April 1840 and refers to the usage and cancellation of the 1d and 2d stamps. These are usually found with a pair of penny blacks attached.

A second notice was sent on 7 May with examples of the 2d stamps as well as the VR official. The pairs of stamps sent with this notice were not originally attached to the notice.

<text>Lejaren Arthur Hiller Jr. (February 23, 1924, New York City – January 26, 1994, Buffalo, New York) was an American composer.

==Career==

In 1957 he collaborated with Leonard Isaacson on his String Quartet No. 4, &quot;Illiac Suite&quot;, the first significant use of a computer to compose music. In 1958 Hiller founded the Experimental Music Studios at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. His notable pupils included composers James Fulkerson, Larry Lake, Ilza Nogueira, David Rosenboom, Margaret Scoville, Michael Ranta, Elliott Sharp, Bernadette Speach and James Tenney. 

He was originally trained as a chemist, and worked as a research chemist for DuPont in Waynesboro, Virginia (1947–52). He developed the first reliable process for dyeing Orlon and coauthored a popular textbook.

He played piano, oboe, clarinet, and saxophone as a child. He also studied composition with Roger Sessions and Milton Babbitt while earning his chemistry degree at Princeton University. His father, Lejaren Hiller, Sr., was a well-known art photographer who specialized in historical tableaux.

He wrote an article on the &quot;Illiac Suite&quot; for &quot;Scientific American&quot; which garnered a lot of attention from the press, generating a storm of controversy. The musical establishment was so hostile to this interloper scientist that both &quot;Baker&#x27;s Biographical Dictionary of Musicians&quot; and the &quot;New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; refused to include him until shortly before his death.

A majority of Hiller&#x27;s works after 1957 do not involve computers at all, but might include stochastic music, indeterminacy, serialism, Brahmsian traditionalism, jazz, performance art, folksong and counterpoint mixed together. He also collaborated with John Cage for &quot;HPSCHD&quot;.

He created the MUSICOMP (&quot;MUsic SImulator-Interpreter for COMpositional Procedures&quot;) programming language for music composition with Robert Baker in order to create their &quot;Computer Cantata&quot; (1963). In 1968, he joined the faculty at University at Buffalo as Slee Professor of Composition, where he established the school&#x27;s first computer music facility and co-directed with Lukas Foss at the Center of the Creative and Performing Arts. Illness forced him to retire in 1989.

==Death==
He died from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in 1994 in Buffalo.

<text>Humphrey Stafford ( – 22 May 1458), generally known by his courtesy title of Earl of Stafford, was the eldest son of Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Lady Anne Neville (d. 1480).

==Biography==

Humphrey Stafford was born on December 2, 1425, the elder twin brother of Henry. His maternal grandparents were Ralph de Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland and Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmorland. His maternal uncles included (among others) Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury (father of &quot;Warwick, the Kingmaker&quot;), Robert Neville who was first Bishop of Salisbury and then Bishop of Durham, William Neville, 1st Earl of Kent and Edward Nevill, 3rd Baron Bergavenny. His most prominent maternal aunt was Cecily Neville, wife of Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York and mother to among others Edward IV of England, Edmund, Earl of Rutland, George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence, Richard III of England, Anne, Duchess of Exeter, Elizabeth, Duchess of Suffolk, and Margaret, Duchess of Burgundy. Other maternal aunts included Eleanor Percy (nee Neville), 2nd Countess of Northumberland, and Katherine Mowbray (nee Neville), 2nd Duchess of Norfolk.

Lord Stafford fought under his father-in-law in support of the House of Lancaster during the First Battle of St Albans. He appears to have been badly wounded at this battle, but eventually died either of his wounds or from the plague, predeceasing his own father in 1458.

Stafford married Lady Margaret Beaufort, daughter of Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset and Lady Eleanor Beauchamp. Humphrey&#x27;s brother married Margaret&#x27;s cousin. Lady Margaret was a sister of Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset (executed 15 May 1464 after the Battle of Hexham) and Edmund Beaufort, 4th Duke of Somerset (executed 6 May 1471 after the Battle of Tewkesbury). Her maternal grandparents were Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick and his first wife Elizabeth Berkeley. By her father, she was a niece of Joan Beaufort, Queen of Scots and a cousin to Lady Margaret Beaufort (mother of King Henry VII). By her mother, Lady Margaret was a niece of Anne de Beauchamp, 16th Countess of Warwick and as such, a cousin to Isabel, Duchess of Clarence and queen consort Anne Neville.

Lord and Lady Stafford had two sons, Henry Stafford (14551483) and Humphrey Stafford. Henry was styled Earl of Stafford on his father&#x27;s death in 1458 and succeeded his paternal grandfather as Duke of Buckingham following the latter&#x27;s death at the Battle of Northampton on 10 July 1460.

<text>Czechoslovakia, of all the East European countries, entered the postwar era with a relatively balanced social structure and an equitable distribution of resources. Despite some poverty, overall it was a country of relatively well-off workers, small-scale producers, farmers, and a substantial middle class. Nearly half the population was in the middle-income bracket. It was a balanced and relatively prosperous Czechoslovakia that carried nationalization and income redistribution further than any other East European country. By the mid-1960s, the complaint was that leveling had gone too far. Earning differentials between blue-collar and white-collar workers were lower than in any other country in Eastern Europe. Further, equitable income distribution was combined in the late 1970s with relative prosperity. Along with East Germany and Hungary, Czechoslovakia enjoyed one of the highest standards of living of any of the Warsaw Pact countries through the 1980s.

Even in Czechoslovakia, where the party&#x27;s pursuit of socialist equality was thorough, the &quot;classless&quot; society turned out to be highly diverse. 
In the mid-1980s, Czechoslovak censuses divided the population into several occupational groups: workers, other employees, members of various cooperatives (principally agricultural cooperatives), small farmers, self-employed tradesmen and professionals, and capitalists. Of these categories, &quot;other employees&quot; was the most diverse, encompassing everyone from low-level clerical workers to cabinet ministers. &quot;Workers&quot; were those whose jobs were primarily manual and industrial. There were well-known distinctions, explained below, between:
*workers (manual or low-level clerical employees),
*agricultural employees, and
*the intelligentsia (whose work is primarily mental and requires more education).

== The workers ==

In 1984 workers made up about one-half of the economically active population and were beneficiaries of policies geared toward maintaining the people&#x27;s standard of living. According to many observers, Czechoslovakia&#x27;s internal stability rested on an unspoken bargain between workers and the ruling KSC: relative material security in return for acquiescence to continued Soviet domination.

Much of working-class life reflected the regime&#x27;s efforts to increase labor productivity without precipitating major labor unrest. Virtually full employment did not make the task easier. In 1984, nearly half the population worked. Some 85% of working-age women were employed (not including those on maternity leave), and there were almost 141,000 full-time university students. Working age for women was from fifteen through fifty-four, and for men it was from fifteen through fifty-nine. By the end of the 1970s, the labor shortage was severe enough for officials to call for greater efforts to employ &quot;internal reserves&quot; of labor, i.e., the partially disabled (of whom nearly one-third were already employed), full-time students, and farmers (during agricultural off-seasons). Voluntary brigades of students and apprentices supplied agricultural (harvest) and other labor during summer months. In Czechoslovakia, as in other socialist countries, virtually full employment often disguises underemployment. Large numbers of people work in positions below their qualifications. This is the result of different factors: some people are reluctant to move to other parts of the country to find work; politically and ideologically &quot;objectionable&quot; people must often turn to menial work; and politically &quot;correct&quot; people hold jobs for which they are not fully qualified. At many enterprises, instead of streamlining operations and dismissing employees whose job performance is unsatisfactory, managers merely shift workers to other positions or juggle employment statistics.

The party&#x27;s compulsion to avoid labor unrest, enterprise managers&#x27; need to meet (or at least approach) production quotas, and a pervasive shortage of labor define the social dynamics of the workplace. Workers have relatively secure employment and income but lack sufficient consumer goods to absorb their income (the rate of saving is extremely high). Nor do workers have a substantive role in organizing work; Ota Šik, noted economic reformer during the 1960s, characterized the Czechoslovak worker as &quot;alienated from the production process, from the fruits of labor, and from the management of industrial enterprises.&quot;

Workers&#x27; complaints have changed over the years as labor has become more scarce.
* In the 1950s real wages declined, resulting in periodic work stoppages.
*The 1953 currency reform sparked protests and demonstrations in major industrial centers that were little short of riots. Throughout the decade, party leaders complained about workers&#x27; &quot;trade unionist&quot; and &quot;anarcho-syndicalist&quot; attitudes and their &quot;take what you can&quot; mentality. Those arrested in the 1953 demonstrations were denounced as &quot;bourgeois elements dressed up in overalls.&quot;
*During the Prague Spring of 1968, workers organized to support demands for political liberalization and more representative trade unions.
*By the late 1970s, forced overtime had become the workers&#x27; most insistent complaint, followed by poor working conditions. These complaints were coupled with steadfast opposition to linking wages with gains in productivity. Workers most frequently called for compliance with the labor code, which limited compulsory overtime (the maximum workweek was supposed to be forty-six hours) and provided for work safety regulations.

One solution to the labor shortage was foreign manpower from fellow socialist nations. For a long time, Poles provided the largest percentage of foreign manpower. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, however, the proportion of Vietnamese workers, brought in by the allied government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, grew rapidly. By the end of 1982, there were approximately 26,000 Vietnamese workers in Czechoslovakia, about 0.3% of the total manual work force, including apprentices. Reasons given for the rapid expansion of the Vietnamese contingent ranged from the Czechoslovak government&#x27;s interest in training qualified labor for a friendly socialist country, to repayment of Vietnamese war debt, to the labor surplus in Vietnam. Problems arose as the number of Vietnamese increased drastically and as a program of merely hard work replaced what was to have been a program for training the Vietnamese in work skills. Other foreigners who worked in Czechoslovakia came from Cuba, Laos, the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic, and Hungary. Poles and Hungarians generally worked in their respective border areas.

Most women in Czechoslovakia worked, a reflection in part of the labor shortage and in part of the socialist belief that employment for women is the answer to inequality between the sexes. Although women in Czechoslovakia have had a long history of employment (they were over one-third of the labor force in 1930), the postwar surge in female employment has been truly dramatic. Four-fifths of the workers who entered the labor force from 1948 through 1975 were women. By the end of 1976, about 87% of working-age women had jobs; in 1984 about 90% of women in their reproductive years were in the labor force. 
In 1983 women remained concentrated in the traditional fields of female employment. Women&#x27;s salaries have lagged behind those of men throughout the socialist era. Only 6 to 7% of middle and upper management positions were held by women. A number of factors account for this continuing inequality.

==Agricultural Workers==

Rural society in the 1980s was a combination of cooperatives (approximately 73% of the agricultural labor force), state farms (18%), and private farms (9%). This represented a dramatic change from the First Republic with its politically active middle-sized farmers, small landholders, and differentiated labor force. Collectivized agriculture has not lacked occupational specialists, but there is no doubt that the socialist regime has streamlined rural society. Differences have persisted, but a dramatic leveling has taken place.

Collectivization began in 1949 with the Unified Agricultural Cooperatives Act. The KSC pushed collectivization efforts early in the 1950s and again later in the decade. Large landholders unwilling to join cooperatives and unwise enough to demur were condemned as &quot;kulaks&quot; and evicted without compensation. Subsequent criticism was muted. By 1960, when collectivization was essentially complete, 90% of all agricultural land was in the state sector—a proportion that slowly increased to 95% in 1985. During the 1960s, 1970s, and early 1980s, the number of cooperatives declined. Land was not returned to private cultivation, but rather the cooperative enterprises themselves were consolidated.

Farmers suffered through the 1950s: compulsory collectivization took their property, and the 1953 currency reform eradicated their savings. By the early 1960s, farm laborers worked longer than their nonagricultural counterparts and earned an average of 15% less. During the late 1960s and 1970s, agricultural earnings rose rapidly. Since the mid-1970s, the incomes of cooperative farm members and industrial workers have been comparable. So dramatic was the improvement that in a 1968 poll more than two-thirds of cooperative farm members preferred collectivized agricultural production to private farming.

The disparity between urban and rural living conditions narrowed in the 1970s. Government planners focused on improving rural day-care facilities; bringing cooperative and state-farm pensions to parity with those of other workers; and increasing the medical, educational, and shopping facilities available to rural dwellers. There was significant construction and renovation of rural housing. The number of new housing units available to cooperative members rose dramatically in the 1960s and then leveled off, although the number fluctuated from year to year. The general improvement in the amenities did not benefit agricultural workers alone; in the early 1970s, over 40% of all industrial workers lived in the countryside.

One result of increased incomes and improved rural living conditions was a rise in the educational level of the agricultural labor force. The percentage of cooperative members with a secondary-school education increased elevenfold from 1960 to the end of 1978, and that of members with a university degree increased thirteenfold.

==Intelligentsia==

By convention, Marxist theorists subdivided the intelligentsia into:
* the creative (writers, artists, and journalists),
* the professional (lawyers, educators, physicians, civil servants, and party bureaucrats), and
* the technical (engineers - directors and deputy directors of socialist enterprises, chairmen of agricultural cooperatives, and managers of retail shops, hotels, restaurants, services, and housing).

The year 1948 saw a turnover in civil service personnel (especially the police) and a substantial influx of workers into political and managerial positions.

The 1950s purges struck hardest at the party faithful, i.e., the most direct beneficiaries of the 1948 takeover. The upheaval of nationalization and collectivization efforts that went further than anywhere else in Eastern Europe, coupled with two currency reforms, signaled a flux in economic fortunes during the first decade of communist rule. A Czech, for example, who was a chief executive in industry in 1948, worked as a carpenter for several years thereafter, served a number of years in prison, and then retrained for a career in law was not exceptional.

In early 1970s, over 25,000 government and trade union officials were replaced. All told, perhaps 150,000 professionals were unable to work in their fields by the end of the decade. The purges included technical and managerial personnel, as well as writers, artists, and KSC members active in the reform movement.

Estimates at the high end suggested that, from the late 1960s to the late 1970s, some 400,000 members of the intelligentsia joined the ranks of manual laborers.

=== Technical intelligentsia ===

In the mid-1980s, the technical intelligentsia occupied an ambiguous position in the decision-making hierarchy. On the one hand, their jobs often demanded considerable technical expertise; on the other hand, decision making in all sectors had a political component under communist rule. The technical intelligentsia had to reconcile the requirements of technical efficiency with those of political orthodoxy. From the KSC&#x27;s perspective, the problem was to ensure a politically reliable corps of technical experts:

Throughout the 1970s, those selected for political compliance (versus training or expertise) predominated among the technical intelligentsia. When a party functionary was unable to meet the demands of his or her position, the custom was to call in a technical expert (even if not a party member) for assistance. KSC hard-liners consistently blocked efforts to reinstate reformist managers deposed after 1968.

Calls for more efficient management and periodic &quot;reassessments&quot; of managerial personnel accompanied changes in the ranks of the technical intelligentsia. In 1980 Federal Finance Minister Leopold Ler suggested that failure to meet production goals would be reflected in bonuses given to management and went so far as to intimate that managers might be dismissed for ineptitude. There was a concerted effort on the part of officialdom to make clear to managers that simple political compliance—adequate to ensure one&#x27;s employment in the early 1970s—would have to be accompanied by efficiency in production in the 1980s.

===Creative intelligentsia ===

As for the country&#x27;s creative intelligentsia the KSC takeover ushered in the era of Stalinist socialist realism in Czechoslovakia&#x27;s arts. It was a movement with strong overtones of Russian chauvinism and a deep anti-Western bias evident in a readiness to denounce anything remotely cosmopolitan as bourgeois, decadent, or both. One suspects that the country that had given world literature Švejk was particularly unpromising ground for Socialist Realism. A blind optimism coupled with revolutionary fervor are the key components of this &quot;aesthetic,&quot; portraying life as it should be according to Marxist theory, rather than as it actually is.

In 1949, the KSC at its Ninth Party Congress issued &quot;directives for new socialist culture.&quot; The congress declared that &quot;literary and artistic production is an important agent of the ideological and cultural rebirth in our country, and it is destined to play a great role in the socialist education of the masses.&quot; Some arts maintained their tradition of excellence throughout the era. Theater productions relied on the classics for their repertoire. Czech filmmakers relied on anti-Nazi, World War II plots to produce works of world renown in the 1960s. This was and has continued to be a safe topic. But writers were a perennial source of consternation for the authorities. Officials of the Novotny regime periodically denounced them for &quot;unprincipled liberalism.&quot; Those placed under interdict wrote, as the phrase went, &quot;for the drawer&quot;; some, like Novomesky, were sentenced to long prison terms.

In the 1970s, the regime&#x27;s policies toward the creative intelligentsia were characterized by a compulsion to control creative activity, coupled with an active paranoia. These policies continued into the 1980s. What motivated censors in ferreting out antisocialist sentiments was sometimes difficult to fathom. Karel Gott, a popular male singer, recorded a song portraying a conversation between a casual lover and his sweetheart that was banned from radio and television. Officialdom found the lyrics &quot;I&#x27;ll flip a coin when you ask if I&#x27;m sincere or not when I say I love you&quot; to be insulting to Czechoslovak currency.

Artists and writers belonged to their own professional organizations. Nonmembers could practice their art as long as they were loyal to the regime.

Musicians and singers faced further constraints. In particular, the regime found the personal habits of many members of popular musical groups too divergent from socialist ideals and subjected them to considerable harassment.

Writers endured the greatest repression. For the purged, with limited exceptions, official publishing outlets were closed. In the meantime, the three writers&#x27; unions (Czechoslovak, Czech, and Slovak), and especially the Czech Writers&#x27; Union, set about grooming a younger generation of writers who, if not overwhelmingly devoted to socialism, were at least assiduously apolitical. In the middle to late 1970s, there was a semithaw: the authorities permitted purged writers to recant and, after a proper measure of self-criticism, publish again. For those who did not avail themselves of this chance, options were indeed limited. By the end of the decade, the government had stepped up efforts to keep Czechoslovak authors from publishing abroad. Those writers who wished to publish successfully at home kept to safe territory—science fiction, World War II novels, fantasy, and children&#x27;s literature—all noncontroversial, basically apolitical genres. A complicated bureaucratic apparatus governed censorship at home. The most critical variable was whether a writer had been expelled from the KSC or simply dropped from its membership lists. There were various kinds and degrees of interdiction: some writers could translate but not write, others could write plays but nothing else, and so forth. Banned writers could sometimes publish their work if a &quot;cover person&quot; assumed authorship. Because &quot;normalization&quot; was characteristically milder in Slovakia, writers were sometimes able to publish works in Bratislava that the Prague censors found unacceptable. This was also partly because the Slovak minister of culture was himself a writer.

==Associations==
Historically, the right to form associations was first won in 1848, although the Habsburgs, realizing that they had opened a Pandora&#x27;s box in their ethnically diverse empire, revoked it soon thereafter. The Czech lands regained this freedom in 1867. The Hungarians, however, offered more concerted opposition to Slovak efforts to organize. But Slovak emigres formed organizations wherever they went, and these associations agitated for Slovakia&#x27;s inclusion in the First Republic.

In 1948 there were 6,000 to 7,000 clubs and societies in Czechoslovakia; these had long been integral to social life and national aspirations. A 1951 law gave the Ministry of Interior jurisdiction over associations, and in the 1960s there were only a few hundred societies still in existence. The right to form associations was limited, and the associations themselves were under strict KSC control. Cultural organizations operated under official auspices. Friendship leagues were particularly encouraged: Bulgarian-, Polish-, or Hungarian-Czechoslovak friendship societies could easily receive official approval. The regime particularly favored the Czechoslovak-Soviet Friendship League, though its rank-and-file membership declined as a result of a surge of anti-Soviet sentiment after the 1968 invasion. There was official sponsorship for &quot;Circles of Creativity&quot; and &quot;Houses of Enlightenment.&quot; Cultural societies for German or Hungarian minorities were acceptable, but religious organizations faced significantly greater restrictions. Any association that might play a role in politics or the economy (that could however remotely or tenuously be construed to threaten KSC domination) was out of the question.

The Prague Spring reinforced this mania for control over associations. The reform movement&#x27;s potential was nowhere more threatening to the hegemony of the party than in the population&#x27;s persistent demands for more truly representative organizations in every area of life. That the KSC membership was underrepresented in the popularly elected leadership of such organizations confirmed the conservatives&#x27; worst suspicions: this was a reform movement whose popular manifestations would prove difficult to control. The regime&#x27;s response was to restrict associations still more.

==The Family==
Families played a pivotal role, according to many observers, in transmitting just those characteristic Czech and Slovak values that have often been criticized by the regime, e.g., the Czech penchant for political pluralism and the Slovak devotion to Roman Catholicism.

The employment of the vast majority of married women of child-bearing age has favored three-generation extended families, in which grandparents (especially grandmothers) have helped women deal with the often conflicting demands of work and child upbringing:
*Family cooperation remained important because child-care centers could not accommodate all children of working mothers, nor would the centers accept children who were ill. Extended families in which a relative played a significant role in child rearing were more common in households where women had a secondary school or university education. Presumably the presence of a grandparent permitted these women to continue an education or assume work responsibilities that might have been precluded if they bore the major share of child care.
*Another factor encouraging extended family households has been Czechoslovakia&#x27;s endemic housing shortage. Although the government&#x27;s pronatalist policies favored married couples (especially those with children) in housing allocation, many young families (perhaps one-third) waited up to five years for their first separate apartment. Most of these families shared an apartment with a mother or mother-in-law. Divorced couples sometimes continued living together simply for want of other housing alternatives. For the elderly, who were expected to trade their apartments for smaller ones as spouses died and children left home, the situation was often difficult.
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the number of marriages in Czechoslovakia declined while the number of divorces increased. Although marriages began to increase in 1982, the rate of divorce continued to climb; it rose from 14% in 1970 to 32% in 1985.

<text>In the 1980s, trade unions were the largest of all Czechoslovak organizations. A single large federation, the Revolutionary Trade Union Movement (Revoluční odborové hnutí / Revolučné odborové hnutie, ROH), represented most wage earners (80 percent in 1983); to deny someone trade union membership was to imply extreme censure.

The role of trade unions under communism is distinctly different from the role it plays in Western society. Under communism, the unions serve as a &quot;school of socialism&quot; for the membership, the goal being to mobilize workers in pursuit of socialist production goals.

During the reform era before 1968, party reformers and workers alike criticized the Revolutionary Trade Movement as a bureaucratically unwieldy organization that was dominated by conservative party functionaries and served as a &quot;conveyor belt&quot; for official labor policy. Workers typically wanted smaller, more representative unions and a variety of economic benefits. More disturbing to the authorities was workers&#x27; propensity to vote party members out of union office and to demand a range of reforms. These reforms were not calculated to allay the fears of those who thought that the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSČ) leading role was critical to socialist development.

Among the demands were the elimination of party and police files on workers (workers often achieved this end by simply burning the files) and the right of union and management representatives (not party officials) to decide personnel matters. Even more disturbing to the authorities was the tendency for workers&#x27; demands to be explicitly and unequivocally political. In major industrial centers, workers called for political pluralism, organized committees to defend freedom of the press, and voiced their support for The Two Thousand Words manifesto. The Writers&#x27; Union went so far as to suggest that they would field a slate of candidates for the National Assembly elections. It was not a turn of events congenial to those who preferred Soviet-style socialism. Not surprisingly, the unions were an early target of &quot;normalization&quot; efforts. An estimated 20 to 50 percent of the leadership was purged, and by the early 1970s the status quo had been effectively restored.
