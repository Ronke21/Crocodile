<text>Jay Robert Inslee ( ; born February 9, 1951) is an American politician and lawyer who served as the 23rd governor of Washington from 2013 to 2025. A member of the Democratic Party, he served from 1993 to 1995 and again from 1999 to 2012 as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, and was a candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.

Born and raised in Seattle, Inslee graduated from the University of Washington and Willamette University College of Law. He served in the Washington House of Representatives from 1989 to 1993. In 1992, Inslee was elected to represent , based around Central Washington, in the U.S. House of Representatives. Defeated for reelection in 1994, Inslee briefly returned to private legal practice. He made his first run for governor of Washington in 1996, coming in fifth in the blanket primary with 10% of the vote. Inslee then served as regional director for the United States Department of Health and Human Services under President Bill Clinton.

Inslee returned to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1999 representing . The new district included Seattle&#x27;s northern suburbs in King County, Snohomish County, and Kitsap County. He was reelected six times before announcing that he would make another run for the governorship in the 2012 election. He defeated Republican Rob McKenna, the state attorney general, 51% to 48%. Inslee was reelected to a second term in 2016. He was briefly a candidate for the Democratic nomination for the 2020 U.S. presidential election. He was reelected to a third term as governor in 2020. On May 1, 2023, he announced that he would not run for a fourth term.

As governor, Inslee has emphasized climate change, education, criminal justice reform, and drug policy reform. He has garnered national attention for his critiques of President Donald Trump. Inslee joined state attorney general Bob Ferguson and state solicitor general Noah Purcell in suing the first Trump administration over Executive Order 13769, which halted travel for 90 days from seven Muslim-majority countries and imposed a total ban on Syrian refugees entering the United States. The case, &quot;Washington v. Trump&quot;, led to the order being blocked by the courts, and other executive orders later superseded it.

==Early life, education, and legal career==
Jay Robert Inslee was born February 9, 1951, in Seattle, Washington, the oldest of three sons of Adele A. (née Brown; d. 2007) and Frank E. Inslee (1926–2014). Inslee is a fifth-generation Washingtonian. Inslee describes his family as being of English and Welsh descent.

Inslee attended Seattle&#x27;s Ingraham High School, where he was an honor-roll student and star athlete, graduating in 1969. He played center on his high school basketball team and was also the starting quarterback on his football team.

Inslee&#x27;s interest in environmental issues originated at an early age, with his parents leading groups of high school students on trips cleaning Mount Rainier. He met his future wife, Trudi Tindall, at Ingraham during his sophomore year. Graduating at the height of the Vietnam War, Inslee received student deferments from the draft.

Inslee began college at Stanford University, where he initially intended on studying medicine. After a year, he was forced to drop out because he was unable to get a scholarship. He returned home and, living in his parents&#x27; basement, attended the University of Washington. He received a Bachelor of Arts with a major in economics in 1973. He then attended the Willamette University College of Law in Salem, Oregon, receiving a Juris Doctor in 1976.

Inslee and his wife were married on August 27, 1972, and have three sons: Jack, Connor, and Joseph. After Inslee finished law school, they moved to Selah, a suburb of Yakima. Inslee joined the law firm Peters, Schmalz, Leadon &amp; Fowler, working as a city prosecutor. He practiced in Selah for 10 years. He first became politically active in 1985, while advocating for the construction of a new high school. The experience sparked Inslee&#x27;s interest in politics, emboldening him to run for political office.

==Washington House of Representatives (1989–1993)==

===Elections===
Inslee ran for the Washington House of Representatives in 1988 after incumbent Republican State Representative Jim Lewis left office. His opponent, Lynn Carmichael, was the former mayor of Yakima and considered the front-runner in the race. Inslee also struggled to balance his more progressive ideology with the conservative leanings of Central Washington. His campaign attempted to rectify this by emphasizing his rural upbringing and legal experience supporting local average people, farms and businesses. The Washington State Trial Lawyers Association became Inslee&#x27;s biggest contributor.

When presented with a potential state budget surplus, Inslee called for a tax cut for the middle class, which Carmichael called irresponsible. Inslee claimed Carmichael had supported a sales tax, which she denied. Inslee was an energetic and active campaigner, benefiting from retail politics.

In the blanket primary, Carmichael ranked first with 43% and Inslee ranked second with 40%. Republican Glen Blomgren ranked third with 17%. In the general election, Inslee defeated Carmichael 52%-48%. In 1990, Inslee was reelected with 62% of the vote against Republican Ted Mellotte.

===Tenure===
In the Washington state legislature, Inslee pursued a bill to provide initial funding to build five branch campuses of the Washington State University system. Although the bill failed, his tenacity made an impression on House Speaker Joe King, who said: &quot;He&#x27;s not afraid to incur the wrath of the speaker or the caucus.&quot; Inslee also focused on preventing steroid usage among high school athletes and pushed for a bill requiring all drivers to carry auto insurance. In 1991, he voted for a bill that required the state to devise a cost-effective energy strategy and state agencies and school districts to pursue and maintain energy-efficient operations.

===Committee assignments===
Inslee served on the Higher Education and Housing Committees.

==Congress (1993–1995)==
===Elections===
;1992

In 1992, six-term incumbent U.S. Representative Sid Morrison chose not to run for reelection representing , instead mounting a campaign for governor. Morrison was a popular moderate Republican incumbent who was considered successful and well-liked in the Democratic-controlled Congress. Despite initially declining to run, Inslee launched a campaign for the open Congressional seat, based in the central-eastern part of the state. His home area of the district, anchored by Yakima, is relatively rural and agriculture-based, while the southeastern part is more focused on research and nuclear waste disposal, anchored by the Tri-Cities. Inslee defeated a favored state senator to win the Democratic primary by 1%. Despite the district&#x27;s conservative lean, Inslee won the general election in an extremely close race.
;1994
He lost his bid for reelection in the Republican Revolution of 1994 in a rematch against his 1992 opponent, Doc Hastings. Inslee attributed his 1994 defeat in large part to his vote for the Federal Assault Weapons Ban.

===Tenure===
In Congress, Inslee passed the Yakima River Enhancement Act, a bill long held up in Congress, by brokering a breakthrough with irrigators and wildlife advocates. He also helped to open Japanese markets to American apples and to fund and oversee the nation&#x27;s biggest nuclear waste site at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation near Richland, Washington.

===Committee assignments===
* United States House Committee on Agriculture
* United States House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology

==Inter-congressional years (1995–1999)==
Inslee moved to Bainbridge Island, a suburb of Seattle, and briefly resumed the practice of law.

===1996 gubernatorial election===

Inslee ran for governor of Washington in 1996, losing in the blanket primary. Democratic King County Executive and former State Representative Gary Locke ranked first with 24% of the vote. Democratic Mayor of Seattle Norm Rice ranked second with 18%, but did not qualify for the general election. Republican State Senator Ellen Craswell ranked third with 15%, and became the Republican candidate in the general election. Republican State Senator and Senate Majority Leader Dale Foreman ranked fourth with 13%. Inslee ranked fifth with 10%. No other candidate on the ballot received double digits.

After his failed gubernatorial bid, Inslee was appointed regional director for the United States Department of Health and Human Services by then-President Bill Clinton.

==Congress (1999–2012)==

===Elections===
Inslee ran again for Congress in 1998, this time in the 1st congressional district against two-term incumbent Rick White. His campaign attracted national attention when he became the first Democratic candidate to air television ads attacking his opponent and the Republican congressional leadership for the Lewinsky scandal. Inslee won with 49.8% of the vote to White&#x27;s 44.1%; he had an unintentional assist in his successful return by the conservative third-party candidacy of Bruce Craswell, husband of 1996 GOP gubernatorial nominee Ellen Craswell.

Inslee was reelected six times. In 2000, he defeated State Senate Minority Leader Dan McDonald with 54.6% of the vote. In 2002, Inslee defeated former state representative Joe Marine with 55.6% of the vote after the district was made more Democratic by redistricting. He never faced another contest that close, and was reelected three more times with over 60% of the vote.

In July 2003, after Gary Locke announced he would not seek a third term as Washington&#x27;s governor, Inslee briefly flirted with a gubernatorial bid before deciding to remain in Congress.

During the 2009-2010 campaign cycle, Inslee raised $1,140,025. In data compiled for the period 2005 to 2007 and excluding individual contributions of less than $200, 64 percent of Inslee&#x27;s donations were from outside the state of Washington and 86 percent came from outside his district (compared to 79 percent for the average House member). 43 percent of Inslee&#x27;s donations came from Washington, D.C., Virginia and Maryland. The largest interests funding Inslee&#x27;s campaign were pharmaceutical and health-related companies, lawyers and law firms, and high-tech companies.

In 2010 he won by a 15-point margin, with 57.67% of the votes cast in his favor.

===Tenure===

As a member of the centrist New Democrat Coalition, Inslee vocally supported policies combating climate change.

Inslee was awarded a &quot;Friend of the National Parks&quot; award by the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) in 2001 for his support of legislation protecting the integrity and quality of the National Park System.

Inslee was &quot;one of Congress&#x27;s most ardent advocates of strong action to combat global warming,&quot; according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;. He was the first public figure to propose an Apollo-like energy program, in an opinion editorial in the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; on December 19, 2002, and a series of similar pieces in other publications. Inslee co-authored &quot;Apollo&#x27;s Fire: Igniting America&#x27;s Clean Energy Economy&quot;, in which he argues that through improved federal policies the United States can wean itself off foreign oil and fossil fuel, create millions of green-collar jobs, and stop global warming. He has been a prominent supporter of the Apollo Alliance. Inslee strongly believes the Environmental Protection Agency should remain authorized to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. In a 2011 House hearing on the Energy Tax Prevention Act, he said Republicans have &quot;an allergy to science and scientists&quot; during a discussion of whether the regulation of greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act should remain in place following a controversial court finding on the issue.

Inslee was an outspoken critic of the George W. Bush administration&#x27;s 2003 invasion of Iraq. On July 31, 2007, he introduced legislation calling for an inquiry to determine whether then United States Attorney General Alberto Gonzales should be impeached. Gonzales eventually resigned.

Still an avid basketball player and fan, Inslee identified as a member of &quot;Hoopaholics&quot;, a charity group dedicated to &quot;treatment of old guys addicted to basketball and who can no longer jump&quot;, as Inslee has often joked. In October 2009, he played basketball at the White House in a series of games featuring members of Congress on one team and members of the administration, including President Obama, on the other.

Inslee voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the federal health care law.

In 2011, Inslee voted in favor of authorizing the use of U.S. armed forces in the 2011 Libyan civil war and against limiting the use of funds to support NATO&#x27;s 2011 military intervention in Libya.

Inslee was once touted as a candidate for United States Secretary of the Interior and for United States Secretary of Energy during the Presidential transition of Barack Obama.

On March 20, 2012, Inslee left Congress to focus on his campaign for governor of Washington.

===Committee assignments===
* United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce
** United States House Energy Subcommittee on Energy and Power

===Caucus memberships===
* Congressional Friends of Animals Caucus
* Congressional Internet Caucus
* House Medicare and Medicaid Fairness Caucus
* House Oceans Caucus
* United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus
* Congressional Arts Caucus
* Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition
* New Democrat Coalition

==Governor of Washington (2013–2025)==

===2012 gubernatorial election===
On June 27, 2011, Inslee announced his candidacy for governor of Washington. His campaign focused on job creation, outlining dozens of proposals to increase job growth in clean energy, the aerospace industry, and biotechnology. He also supported a ballot measure to legalize gay marriage, which passed, and opposed tax increases. Though trailing in early polls, he won election with 51% of the vote, a three-point margin over his Republican opponent, state attorney general Rob McKenna.

===2016 gubernatorial election===

In December 2015, Inslee announced on Washington&#x27;s public affairs TV channel TVW that he would run for a second term as governor. He emphasized increased spending on transportation and education as his primary first-term accomplishment, though he had struggled to work with the Republican-controlled Majority Coalition Caucus in the State Senate.

In the general election Inslee faced former Port of Seattle Commissioner Bill Bryant. The primary issues of the campaign were climate change, job creation, minimum wage, and capital gains taxes. Inslee far outraised Bryant, and was reelected in November with 54% of the vote.

===2020 gubernatorial election===

On March 1, 2019, Inslee announced he would run for president, but kept open the possibility of running for a third term if his presidential campaign failed. Several potential Democratic gubernatorial candidates, including state Attorney General Bob Ferguson, Commissioner of Public Lands Hilary Franz, and King County Executive Dow Constantine, were all waiting to announce campaigns until Inslee made his decision. As Inslee&#x27;s presidential campaign failed to gain traction during the summer of 2019, he was pressured to drop out and make his gubernatorial plans clear to the other potential candidates. On August 21, 2019, Inslee dropped out of the presidential campaign and announced the next day he would run for reelection as governor.

Inslee&#x27;s major opponents in the election were State Senator Phil Fortunato, Republic, Washington police chief Loren Culp, Yakima physician Raul Garcia, activist Tim Eyman and former Bothell mayor Joshua Freed. Inslee finished first in the primary, with 50% of the vote. Culp finished a distant second, with 17%. Inslee and Culp advanced to the general election, which Inslee won with 57% of the vote. His margin of victory was the largest in a gubernatorial election in Washington since Gary Locke&#x27;s in 2000 and he also became the first Democrat in two decades to win a county in Eastern Washington, winning Whitman County.

Inslee became the first Washington governor elected to a third term since Dan Evans was reelected in 1972.

=== First term: 2013–2017 ===
During the 2013 session, the legislature failed to create a fiscal budget plan during the initial session, and Inslee was forced to call two special sessions to provide time for a budget to be created. The Republican-controlled Senate and Democratic-controlled House each passed its own budget and could not agree on one. Finally, in June 2013, Inslee signed a $33.6 billion budget to which both houses had agreed as a compromise. The budget increased funding for education by $1 billion. It also adjusted property taxes and tax breaks in order to increase state revenue by $1 billion.

On June 13, 2013, Inslee signed an additional estate tax into law. The tax had bipartisan support, and passed the Senate, 30–19.
In December 2013, Inslee was elected to serve as finance chair of the Democratic Governors Association.

In January 2014, Inslee gave a speech commending machinists who voted to renew Boeing&#x27;s contract with Seattle area union employees, allowing the company to build its Boeing 777x aircraft in Everett. He said the contract would bring Washington to a new industrial plateau and be a turning point for Washington jobs:

These jobs are in the thousands and it is not only on the 777X, the first model of the 777X, but all the subsequent derivative models as well.

The plan was to prevent Boeing from building part of the aircraft in Washington and part of it elsewhere, as they did with the Boeing 787, which was partially constructed in South Carolina.

On February 11, 2014, Inslee announced a moratorium on executions in Washington:

There have been too many doubts raised about capital punishment, there are too many flaws in this system today. There is too much at stake to accept an imperfect system.

Inslee cited the high cost of pursuing the death penalty, the randomness with which it is sought, and the lack of evidence that it is a deterrent.

=== Second term: 2017–2021 ===
Inslee began his second term on January 11, 2017, proposing full funding of state education (in compliance with the McCleary decision) and addressing mental health needs while also raising worker pay. After newly inaugurated President Donald Trump signed an executive order on January 27 banning people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States, Inslee and Attorney General Bob Ferguson announced their intention to sue Trump, alleging his order was unconstitutional. The civil action, &quot;Washington v. Trump&quot;, was filed on January 30 and on February 3 successfully earned a temporary restraining order to forbid federal enforcement of some of the ban&#x27;s provisions. An appeal and request to stay filed by the federal government was subsequently denied by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Inslee and Ferguson declared victory over Trump on February 16, after his administration announced it would revise the travel ban to comply with the court decisions. Inslee garnered national media attention during the lawsuit.

During the 2017 legislative session, the Washington State Legislature failed to pass a state operating budget by the end of its regular session on April 25, so Inslee called for a 30-day special session. The legislature again failed to pass a budget during that session, forcing Inslee to call a third one, beginning June 22. As the state&#x27;s fiscal year ends on June 30, a partial government shutdown was feared. Conflict over resource allocation between rural areas and urban areas was a major reason for the impasse. The State Senate passed a budget on June 30 and Inslee signed it into law shortly after 11 pm. Its specifics were still being released several hours after it was enacted. Lawmakers critiqued the haste with which the budget was considered and passed, having received the 616-page document only that day. By the end of the third session on July 20, the legislature had still failed to pass a capital budget concerning long-term goals and improvements. This was the third time during Inslee&#x27;s tenure the state&#x27;s budget was passed in the last week of the legislative session.

In December 2017 Inslee awarded $6.4 million in grant funding for apprenticeships and career connections to 29,000 youth in 11 communities. He called this initiative Career Connect Washington. It includes a Task Force and several prominent stakeholder groups including Alaska Airlines, Amazon, Boeing, Microsoft, and Kaiser Permanente. Career Connect Washington has established new apprenticeship opportunities, including the Aerospace Joint Apprenticeship Committee&#x27;s registered Youth Apprenticeship program for high school students.

Inslee served as chair of the Democratic Governors Association for the 2018 election cycle, in which Democrats gained seven net governorships nationwide.

In December 2018, Inslee announced new legislation aimed at reducing the state&#x27;s carbon emissions over approximately two decades. It would effectively require Washington utilities to end the use of fossil fuels by mid-century, making Washington &quot;adopt a clean fuel standard&quot;, &quot;promote electric and low-emission vehicles&quot;, and &quot;provide incentives to renovate existing buildings to reduce&quot; emissions.

In January 2019, Inslee said he would provide an expedited process for approximately 3,500 people convicted of small-time cannabis possession to apply for and receive pardons.

In March and April 2020, Inslee ordered significant social distancing measures statewide, including banning large events, a stay-at-home order, and the closing of all schools due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

On June 8, 2020, in the wake of protests over police brutality, a group of protesters established the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (also known as the Zone or the CHAZ) in Seattle. The Zone prided itself on offering free food and being free of police. However, it also experienced internal violence and vandalism, including four shootings in ten days. President Donald Trump condemned the Zone, saying that Seattle had been taken over by anarchists, and called on Inslee and the mayor of Seattle to &quot;take back&quot; the neighborhood from protesters. Inslee responded that he was unaware of the Zone&#x27;s existence, but called on Trump to &quot;stay out of Washington State&#x27;s business&quot;.

In November 2020, Inslee was named a candidate for Secretary of Energy, Secretary of the Interior and the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in the Biden Administration.

===Third term: 2021–2025===
Inslee began his third term on January 13, 2021.

On April 8, 2021, Inslee signed a bill restoring voting rights to convicted felons after they finish serving their sentences. This made Washington the 20th state to have such laws, and it was primarily sponsored by representative Tarra Simmons, who was formerly incarcerated herself.

On May 4, 2021, Inslee signed a new capital gains tax into law. The tax narrowly passed the Senate, 25–24. It affects certain investments, such as the sale of stocks and bonds, and taxes profits that total $250,000 or more at 7%. It includes many exemptions, including retirement accounts, livestock, timber, and real estate. This was followed by two lawsuits, which were later consolidated into one, led by former state attorney general and Inslee&#x27;s 2012 gubernatorial opponent Rob McKenna. The lawsuit alleges that the tax is a state income tax in disguise and is unconstitutional due to precedent, with a graduated state income tax being declared unconstitutional in 1933. In September 2021, Grant County superior court judge Brian Huber allowed this lawsuit to proceed. In March 2023, the Washington Supreme Court dismissed the lawsuit and upheld the new capital gains tax, which took effect in April 2023.

In August 2021, Inslee mandated vaccinations for state and health care workers by October 18 without a weekly testing alternative.

Upon the resignation of New York governor Andrew Cuomo on August 23, 2021, Inslee became the longest-serving current governor in the United States. Inslee filed initial paperwork to run for a fourth term in the 2024 election, but announced in May 2023 that he would not run for a fourth term. Although some governors have run for a fourth term, none has been elected to a fourth term in the state&#x27;s history.

Following the resignation of Republican Secretary of State Kim Wyman, to take a job in the Biden administration, Inslee was tasked with appointing her replacement. He appointed state senator Steve Hobbs, a Democrat, noting that former Republican governor John Spellman appointed Republican Dan Evans to fill the vacancy created by the death of Democratic U.S. Senator Scoop Jackson in 1983. Hobbs is a moderate who opposed many of Inslee&#x27;s priorities while in the state senate, including abolishing the death penalty, gun control, reducing carbon emissions, expanding voting rights to parolees, and a state income tax. These positions put him at odds with Inslee and were widely seen as a prime reason for his appointment. The appointment led to the Washington State Democratic Party holding all nine statewide executive offices for the first time since the Great Depression.

In 2023, Inslee praised the Washington House of Representatives&#x27; passage of a bill banning assault weapons. In 2023, several conservative organizations sued the Washington state government over SB5599, a bill Inslee signed into law that permits youth shelters to notify state authorities instead of parents when a minor seeks medical treatments such as abortion, puberty blockers, or gender-reassignment surgery. Critics of the bill argue that it infringes on parental rights protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, claiming it deprives parents of their &quot;fundamental right to direct the care and upbringing of their children&quot; and their rights to the free exercise of religion, due process, free speech, and equal protection.

==2020 presidential campaign==

Throughout 2018, speculation rose that Inslee might run for president of the United States in the 2020 election. He garnered national attention because of &quot;Washington v. Trump,&quot; a lawsuit challenging the first Trump Administration&#x27;s order to ban people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. While Inslee was chair of the Democratic Governors Association, Democrats gained seven net governorships in the 2018 gubernatorial elections, further propelling him into the national spotlight and fueling speculation that he would run. Inslee cited climate change as his primary motivation for running, strongly criticizing the Trump Administration&#x27;s policies.

In January 2019, reports surfaced that Inslee was beginning to form an exploratory committee, the first step in a campaign. Inslee was a dark-horse candidate; initially, he was rarely included in polling for the primary, was not well known outside Washington, and made few trips to early primary states such as Iowa and New Hampshire. But he pointed to former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, calling them &quot;pretty much unknown governors of small states&quot; and adding, &quot;this is a wide-open field. No one has a lock on this. No one has a total crystal ball as to what the nation wants.&quot;

Inslee announced his candidacy for president on March 1, 2019, saying he would focus on combating climate change. His campaign requested a debate focused on climate change. The Democratic National Committee denied the request, but 53 of its voting members wrote an open letter protesting that decision.

Facing poor polling numbers and seeing no path to victory, Inslee announced the suspension of his campaign on &quot;The Rachel Maddow Show&quot; on August 21, 2019, and announced the following day that he would run for a third term as governor in the 2020 election. Inslee endorsed Joe Biden for the presidency on April 22, 2020.

<text>Deportation is the expulsion of a person or group of people by a state from its sovereign territory. The actual definition changes depending on the place and context, and it also changes over time. A person who has been deported or is under sentence of deportation is called a &quot;deportee&quot;.

==Definition==
Definitions of deportation vary, with some implicating &quot;transfer beyond State borders&quot; (distinguishing it from forcible transfer), others considering it &quot;the actual implementation of [an expulsion] order in cases where the person concerned does not follow it voluntarily&quot;, and others differentiating removal of legal immigrants (expulsion) and illegal immigrants (deportation).

Deportation in the most general sense, in accordance with International Organization for Migration, treats expulsion and deportation as synonyms in the context of migration, adding:
&quot;The terminology used at the domestic or international level on expulsion and deportation is not uniform but there is a clear tendency to use the term expulsion to refer to the legal order to leave the territory of a State, and removal or deportation to refer to the actual implementation of such order in cases where the person concerned does not follow it voluntarily.&quot;

According to the European Court of Human Rights, collective expulsion is any measure compelling non-nationals, as a group, to leave a country, except where such a measure is taken on the basis of a reasonable and objective examination of the particular case of each individual non-national of the group. Mass expulsion may also occur when members of an ethnic group are sent out of a state regardless of nationality. Collective expulsion, or expulsion en masse, is prohibited by several instruments of international law.

==History==
===Antiquity===
Expulsions widely occurred in ancient history, and is well-recorded particularly in ancient Mesopotamia. The kingdoms of Israel and Judah faced several forced expulsions, including deportations by the Neo-Assyrian Empire following the fall of Israel and during Sennacherib&#x27;s campaign in the 8th century BC. Later, the Neo-Babylonian Empire deported much of the Judean population upon conquering Judah in 597 BC and 587 BC.

====Deportation in the Achaemenid Empire====
Deportation was practiced as a policy toward rebellious people in Achaemenid Empire. The precise legal status of the deportees is unclear; but ill-treatment is not recorded. Instances include:
====Deportation in the Parthian Empire====
Unlike in the Achaemenid and Sassanian periods, records of deportation are rare during the Arsacid Parthian period. One notable example was the deportation of the Mards in Charax, near Rhages (Ray) by Phraates I. The 10,000 Roman prisoners of war after the Battle of Carrhae appear to have been deported to Alexandria Margiana (Merv) near the eastern border in 53 BC, who are said to married to local people. It is hypothesized that some of them founded the Chinese city of Li-Jien after becoming soldiers for the Hsiung-nu, but this is doubted.

Hyrcanus II, the Jewish king of Judea (Jerusalem), was settled among the Jews of Babylon in Parthia after being taken as captive by the Parthian-Jewish forces in 40 BC.

Roman POWs in the Antony&#x27;s Parthian War may have suffered deportation.

====Deportation in the Sasanian empire====

Deportation was widely used by the Sasanians, especially during the wars with the Romans.

During Shapur I&#x27;s reign, the Romans (including Valerian) who were defeated at the Battle of Edessa were deported to Persis. Other destinations were Parthia, Khuzestan, and Asorestan. There were cities which were founded and were populated by Romans prisoners of war, including Shadh-Shapur (Dayr Mikhraq) in Meshan, Bishapur in Persis, Wuzurg-Shapur (Ukbara; Marw-Ḥābūr), and Gundeshapur. Agricultural land were also given to the deportees. These deportations initiated the spread Christianity in the Sassanian empire. In Rēw-Ardashīr (Rishahr; Yarānshahr), Persis, there was a church for the Romans and another one for Carmanians. Their hypothesized decisive role in the spread of Christianity in Persia and their major contribution to Persian economy has been recently criticized by Mosig-Walburg (2010). In the mid-3rd century, Greek-speaking deportees from north-western Syria were settled in Kashkar, Mesopotamia.

After the Arab incursion into Persia during Shapur II&#x27;s reign, he scattered the defeated Arab tribes by deporting them to other regions. Some were deported to Bahrain and Kirman, possibly to both populate these unattractive regions (due to their climate) and bringing the tribes under control.

In 395 AD 18,000 Roman populations of Sophene, Armenia, Mesopotamia, Syria, and Cappadocia were captured and deported by the &quot;Huns&quot;. the prisoners were freed by the Persians as they reached Persia, and were settled in Slōk (Wēh Ardashīr) and Kōkbā (Kōkhē). The author of the text &quot;Liber Calipharum&quot; has praised the king Yazdegerd I (399–420) for his treatment of the deportees, who also allowed some to return.

Major deportations occurred during the Anastasian War, including Kavad I&#x27;s deportation of the populations of Theodosiopolis and Amida to Arrajan (Weh-az-Amid Kavad).

Major deportations occurred during the campaigns of Khosrau I from the Roman cities of Sura, Beroea, Antioch, Apamea, Callinicum, and Batnai in Osrhoene, to Wēh-Antiyōk-Khosrow (also known as Rūmagān; in Arabic: al-Rūmiyya). The city was founded near Ctesiphon especially for them, and Khosrow reportedly &quot;did everything in his power to make the residents want to stay&quot;. The number of the deportees is recorded to be 292,000 in another source.

===Middle Ages===

The Medieval European age was marked with several large religious deportations, including that of Christians, Jews and Muslims. For instance, the Almoravid deported Christians from Spain to Morocco, with mass deportations taking place in 1109, 1126, 1130 and 1138.

===Modern deportation===
With the beginning of the Age of Discovery, deporting individuals to an overseas colony also became common practice. As early as the 16th century, &quot;degredados&quot; formed a substantial portion of early colonists in Portuguese empire. From 1717 onward Britain deported around 40,000 British religious objectors and &quot;criminals&quot; to America before the practice ceased in 1776. Jailers sold the &quot;criminals&quot; to shipping contractors, who then sold them to plantation owners. The &quot;criminals&quot; worked for the plantation owner for the duration of their sentence. After Britain lost control of the area which became the United States, Australia became the destination for &quot;criminals&quot; deported to British colonies. Britain transported more than 160,000 British &quot;criminals&quot; to the Australian colonies between 1787 and 1855.

Meanwhile, in Japan during Sakoku, all Portuguese and Spanish people were expelled from the country.

In the 18th century the Tipu Sultan, of Mysore, deported tens of thousands of civilians, from lands he had annexed, to serve as slave labour in other parts of his empire, for example the: Captivity of Mangalorean Catholics at Seringapatam.

In the late 19th century the United States of America began designating &quot;desired&quot; and &quot;undesired&quot; immigrants, leading to the birth of illegal immigration and subsequent deportation of immigrants when found in irregular situations. Starting with the Chinese Exclusion Act, the US government has since deported more than 55 million immigrants, the majority of whom came from Latin-American countries.

At the beginning of the 20th century the control of immigration began becoming common practice, with the Immigration Restriction Act 1901 in Australia, the Aliens Act 1905 in the United Kingdom and the Continuous journey regulation of 1908 in Canada, elevating the deportation of &quot;illegal&quot; immigrants to a global scale.

In the meantime, deportation of &quot;regular residents&quot; also increased.

====United States====

In the 1930s, during the Great Depression, more stringent enforcement of immigration laws were ordered by the executive branch of the U.S. government, which led to increased deportation and repatriation to Mexico. In the 1930s, during the Great Depression, between 355,000 and 2 million Mexicans and Mexican Americans were deported or repatriated to Mexico, an estimated 40 to 60% of whom were U.S. citizens – overwhelmingly children. At least 82,000 Mexicans were formally deported between 1929 and 1935 by the government. Voluntary repatriations were more common than deportations. In 1954, the executive branch of the U.S. government implemented Operation Wetback, a program created in response to public hysteria about immigration and immigrants from Mexico. Operation Wetback led to the deportation of nearly 1.3 million Mexicans from the United States.

====Nazi Germany====
Nazi policies deported homosexuals, Jews, Poles, and Romani from their established places of residence to Nazi concentration camps or extermination camps set up at a considerable distance from their original residences. During the Holocaust, the Nazis made heavy use of euphemisms, where &quot;deportation&quot; frequently meant the victims were subsequently killed, as opposed to simply being relocated.

====Soviet Union====

The Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin carried out forced mass transfers of some 6 million people during the 1930s and 1940s, resulting in millions of deaths. As many as 110 separate deportations have been catalogued, included the targeting of at least 13 distinct ethnicities and 8 entire nations. Many historians have described Soviet deportations as ethnic cleansing, crimes against humanity, and/or genocide.

====Independent State of Croatia====
An estimated 120,000 Serbs were deported from the Independent State of Croatia to German-occupied Serbia, and 300,000 fled by 1943.

=== Contemporary ===
All countries reserve the right to deport persons without right of abode, even those who are longtime residents or possess permanent residency. In general, foreigners who have committed serious crimes, entered the country illegally, overstayed or broken the conditions of their visa, or otherwise lost their legal status to remain in the country may be administratively removed or deported.

Since the 1980s, the world also saw the development of practices of externalization/&quot;offshoring immigrants&quot;, currently being used by Australia, Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union. Some of the countries in the Persian Gulf have even used this to deport their own citizens, paying the Comoros to give them passports and accept them.

The period after the fall of the Iron Curtain showed increased deportation and readmission agreements in parts of Europe.

During its invasion of Ukraine, the Russian Federation has perpetrated mass deportations of Ukrainian citizens to Russia and occupied territories. While independent numbers are difficult to come by, and depending on the degree of Russian coercion or force required to meet the definition of &quot;deported&quot;, reported numbers range from tens of thousands to 4.5 million deportees.

Dominican Republic deported more than 250,000 Haitians and Dominicans of Haitian descent to Haiti in 2023.

==Noteworthy deportees==

Alexander Berkman, Emma Goldman, C.L.R. James, Claudia Jones, Fritz Julius Kuhn, Lucky Luciano, and Anna Sage were all deported from the United States by being arrested and brought to the federal immigration control station on Ellis Island in New York Harbor and, from there, forcibly removed from the United States on ships.

==Opposition==

Many criticize deportations as inhumane, as well as questioning their effectiveness. Some are completely opposed towards any deportations, while others state it is inhumane to take somebody to a foreign land without their consent.

==In popular culture==
In literature, deportation appears as an overriding theme in the 1935 novel, &quot;Strange Passage&quot; by Theodore D. Irwin.
Films depicting or dealing with fictional cases of deportation are many and varied. Among them are &quot;Ellis Island&quot; (1936), &quot;Exile Express&quot; (1939), &quot;Five Came Back&quot; (1939), &quot;Deported&quot; (1950), and &quot;Gambling House&quot; (1951). More recently, &quot;Shottas&quot; (2002) treated the issue of U.S. deportation to the Caribbean post-1997.

<doc id="412993" wikidata="Q445616" url="?curid=412993" title="Bob Guccione">
<text>Robert Charles Joseph Edward Sabatini Guccione ( ; December 17, 1930 – October 20, 2010) was an American visual artist, photographer and publisher. He founded the adult magazine &quot;Penthouse&quot; in 1965. This was aimed at competing with Hugh Hefner&#x27;s &quot;Playboy&quot;, but with more explicit erotic content, a special style of soft focus photography, and in-depth reporting of government corruption scandals and the art world. By 1982 Guccione was listed in the &quot;Forbes 400&quot; wealth list, and owned one of the biggest mansions in Manhattan. However, he made some extravagant investments that failed, and the growth of free online pornography in the 1990s greatly diminished his market. In 2003, Guccione&#x27;s publishers filed for bankruptcy and he resigned as chairman.

==Early life==
Guccione was born in Brooklyn, New York, of Italian (Sicilian) descent and raised Catholic in Bergenfield, New Jersey, the eldest child of Anthony, an accountant, and Nina, a housewife. An altar boy, he considered but rejected entering the priesthood. He attended high school at Blair Academy, a prep school in Blairstown, New Jersey.

In his teens, Guccione married his first wife, Lilyann Becker. The couple had a daughter, Tonina (1949–2020). The marriage failed, and he left his wife and child to go to Europe to be a painter. He eventually met an English woman, Muriel Hudson, moved to London with her, and married her. They had four children.

To support his family, Guccione managed a chain of laundromats until he got work as a cartoonist on an American weekly newspaper, &quot;The London American&quot;, while Muriel started a business selling pinup posters. He occasionally created cartoons for Bill Box&#x27;s humorous greeting card company Box Cards.

==Career==
&quot;Penthouse&quot; began publication in 1965 in the United Kingdom and in North America in 1969, an attempt to compete with Hugh Hefner&#x27;s &quot;Playboy&quot;. Although &quot;Playboy&quot; had always had a liberal bent and championed the civil rights movement and other social justice causes, Guccione offered editorial content that was more sensational, and the magazine&#x27;s writing was far more investigative than other men&#x27;s magazines, with stories about government cover-ups and scandals. Writers such as Craig S. Karpel, James Dale Davidson and Ernest Volkman, as well as the critically acclaimed Seymour Hersh, exposed numerous scandals and corruption at the highest levels of the United States government. On the other hand, &quot;Playboy&quot; retained a certain conservatism and embraced mainstream American consumerism rather than rejecting it. During the late 1960s, feminist groups criticized the magazine for supporting women&#x27;s liberation only in terms of making them free to engage in sexual relationships with men. While &quot;Playboy&quot; devoted extensive print to covering sports, one of Hugh Hefner&#x27;s great passions, Guccione had no interest in them and never bothered discussing sporting events or athletes in &quot;Penthouse&quot;, instead preferring to cover the art world. The magazine was founded on humble beginnings. Owing to his lack of resources, Guccione personally photographed most of the models for the magazine&#x27;s early issues.

As the magazine grew more successful, Guccione openly embraced a life of luxury; his former mansion at 14-16 East 67th Street on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side was said to be the largest private residence in the borough at . However, in contrast to Hugh Hefner, who threw wild parties at his Playboy Mansions, life at Guccione&#x27;s mansion was remarkably sedate, even during the height of the sexual revolution in the 1970s. He reportedly once had his bodyguards eject a local radio personality who had been hired as a DJ and jumped into the swimming pool naked.

The magazine&#x27;s pictorials offered more sexually explicit content than was commonly seen in most openly sold men&#x27;s magazines of the era; it was the first to show female pubic hair, followed by full-frontal nudity and then the exposed vulva and anus. Up to the end of the 1960s, it was not acceptable to display anything more than a female&#x27;s buttocks or breasts in mainstream publications and anything more risked obscenity charges. Only low-budget underground magazines displayed female genitals or explicit poses. However, the counterculture movement led to an increasingly liberated sexual attitude after which a series of court rulings struck down most legal restrictions on pornography. &quot;Penthouse&quot; has also, over the years, featured a number of authorized and unauthorized photos of celebrities such as Madonna and Vanessa Lynn Williams. In both cases, the photos were taken earlier in their careers and sold to &quot;Penthouse&quot; only after Madonna and Williams became famous. In Williams&#x27;s case, this led to her forced resignation as Miss America 1984. The September 1984 issue in which Williams was first featured also included a layout with pornographic actress Traci Lords, who was only 15 when the photo shoot was done and was later revealed to be underage throughout most of her career. (Madonna famously responded to the publication of her nude photos by stating &quot;So what?&quot;.) In the late 1990s, the magazine began to show more &quot;fetish&quot; content such as urination, bondage and &quot;facials.&quot;

In the early 1970s, Guccione invested around US$45 million in construction of Haludovo Palace Hotel, a luxury hotel resort in Malinska on Krk Island near Rijeka on the northern Adriatic coast of Yugoslavia. He invested an additional $500,000 in advertisement. Despite Yugoslavia being nominally a communist country, it encouraged foreign investments. The entire project was designed by Yugoslav architect Boris Magaš and realized through Brodokomerc, a local company. Prior to that, the project needed to be authorized through a so-called workers&#x27; council, a process which Guccione described as &quot;ridiculously easy&quot;. The hotel officially opened in 1972. Staff included around 50 Penthouse Pets, and the guests included the former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein. However, the hotel went bankrupt the next year.

In 1976, Guccione used about US $17.5 million of his personal fortune to finance the controversial historical epic erotic film &quot;Caligula&quot;, with Malcolm McDowell in the title role and a supporting cast including Helen Mirren, John Gielgud and Peter O&#x27;Toole. The film, released in late 1979, was produced in Italy (made at the Dear Studios in Rome) and was directed by Tinto Brass. Guccione also created the magazines &quot;Omni&quot;, &quot;Viva&quot;, and &quot;Longevity&quot;. Later Guccione started &quot;Penthouse Forum&quot;, which was more textual in content. In the early 2000s, &quot;Penthouse&quot; published a short-lived comic book spin-off entitled &quot;Penthouse Comix&quot; featuring sexually explicit stories.

In 1982, Guccione was listed in the Forbes 400 ranking of wealthiest people, with a reported $400 million net worth. An April 2002 &quot;New York Times&quot; article quoted Guccione as saying that Penthouse grossed $3.5 billion to $4 billion over the 30-year life of the company, with a net income of almost $500 million.

===Awards and recognition===
Guccione&#x27;s editorial content was praised and recognized by some in the academic field. In 1975, for example, he was honored by Brandeis University for focusing &quot;his editorial attention on such critical issues of our day as the welfare of the Vietnam veteran and problems of criminality in modern society.&quot;

Guccione was also praised by certain professional groups and associations for his dealings with them. In April 1978 he was named &quot;Publisher of the Year&quot; by the Atlantic Coast Independent Distributors Association in gratitude for his &quot;leadership, his fair treatment and his continuing friendship with our members&quot;.

In 2013, director Barry Avrich made a film about Guccione&#x27;s life entitled &quot;Filthy Gorgeous: The Bob Guccione Story&quot;. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2013. It was later broadcast in Canada on The Movie Network and Movie Central and in the United States on Epix in November 2013.

===Decline and resignation===
Several wildly unsuccessful investments by Guccione—including the Penthouse Boardwalk Hotel and Casino (which lost $160 million) and a (never-built) nuclear fusion power plant—added to his publishing empire&#x27;s financial woes. Guccione&#x27;s efforts to regain sales and notoriety, which included attempts to get Monica Lewinsky to pose for the magazine (which was parodied in a sketch on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 1998) and offering the Unabomber a free forum for his views, failed to increase readership. With the rise of online access to (often free) pornography in the late 1990s, &quot;Penthouse&quot;&#x27;s circulation numbers suffered even more.

In 2003, General Media, &quot;Penthouse&quot; publisher, filed for bankruptcy protection. Guccione resigned as chairman of the board and CEO of Penthouse International, Inc.

===Legal dispute===
In 2006, Guccione sued Penthouse Media Group for fraud, breach of contract, and conspiracy, among other charges. Some of the people named in the case were Marc Bell, Jason Galanis, Fernando Molina, and Daniel C. Stanton.

==Other work==
Guccione gave Anna Wintour her first job as a fashion editor at his magazine &quot;Viva&quot;. He was an investor in the films &quot;Chinatown&quot; and &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot;.

==Personal life==
===Family===
Guccione&#x27;s British-raised son, Bob Guccione Jr. (born 1955), was given editorship of &quot;Spin&quot;, but father and son soon fell out over editorial decisions, and Bob Jr. eventually found independent investors to continue financing the magazine. They remained estranged for a long time, but reportedly reconciled before Guccione Sr.&#x27;s death in 2010.

===Marriages===
Guccione was married four times: he first married Lilyann Becker in his late teens and their daughter Tonina was born in 1949.

His second was to a British woman, Muriel Hudson, with whom he had four children. They divorced in 1979.

His third marriage, in 1988, was to his long-time companion, Kathy Keeton, a native of South Africa. In 1997, Keeton died of complications from surgery to remedy an obstruction in her digestive tract after a long battle with cancer. She was 58.

In her last few months, Keeton befriended an ex-model named April Dawn Warren, and gossip maintained that Warren was Keeton&#x27;s hand-picked successor. After a long engagement, he and Warren wed in 2006 and they remained together until his death. Guccione continued to list Keeton on the &quot;Penthouse&quot; masthead posthumously as president, but later added Warren to the masthead after she had spent ten years as creative director of the magazine.

Warren and Guccione were working on a book of reminiscences, &quot;Good to Know&quot;, until shortly before his death in 2010, at age 79. He died with Warren at his side.

===Residence===
Guccione brought artisans in from France and Italy to remodel the largest private residence in Manhattan (at 14-16 East 67th Street on the Upper East Side). As a tribute to Guccione, the artisans carved both his and his wife&#x27;s faces into the marble columns near the entrance of the mansion. According to &quot;New York&quot; magazine, &quot;It&#x27;s one of the biggest private houses in Manhattan, with 30 rooms, and it costs $5 million a year to maintain.&quot;

In November 2003, the mansion was foreclosed on by Kennedy Funding of New Jersey, the mortgage holder, along with an affiliate of multibillion-dollar hedge fund Elliott Associates of New Jersey. In January 2004, a group of investors came to Guccione&#x27;s aid during his eviction. A London-based investor, Jason Galanis, led the investment group which purchased the property for $26.5 million in cash. The house was purchased by NY Real Estate LLC, an entity set up to acquire the mansion. Galanis contributed $2.6 million, and two New York hedge funds, Laurus Funds and Alexandre Asset Management, made a mortgage loan of $24 million to NY Real Estate LLC, which was owned by Penthouse International, the parent and debtor-in-possession of General Media.

As a result of the continuing contentious bankruptcy, which lasted over a year, the promissory notes due to Laurus were considered in technical breach of covenants which resulted in severe financial penalties in excess of $8 million. Penthouse International elected to forgo refinancing the house due to the combination of the penalties and the unfavorable lifetime lease of $1 per year that was granted to Guccione, which made the property unmarketable. Laurus sued Guccione to take possession of the house from the tenant.

Guccione also lost his country house in Staatsburg, New York, as the 15-room Baroque-style stucco mansion on a 75-acre property on the Hudson River was foreclosed and sold for $4 million. The estate was purchased by actress Uma Thurman and hotelier André Balazs, and it is now known as Locusts on Hudson.

===Art collection===
Guccione was a painter whose art premiered at Nassau County Museum of Art as well as the Butler Institute of American Art. His art continues to hang in the Borghi Fine Art Gallery, is featured in the POBA - Where the Arts Live online collection, and is a part of the Filthy Gorgeous Media art collection. Bob Guccione was a world-renowned collector of fine art. Highlights of the Guccione collection included a portrait by Amedeo Modigliani and a Pablo Picasso portrait of the artist&#x27;s son, Paulo. He owned paintings by Sandro Botticelli, Albrecht Dürer, El Greco, Marc Chagall, Salvador Dalí, Giorgio de Chirico, Edgar Degas, Fernand Léger, Gilbert Stone, Henri Matisse, Jules Pascin, Camille Pissarro, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Georges Henri Rouault, Chaïm Soutine, and Vincent van Gogh. 

The Guccione art collection was sold at auction by Sotheby&#x27;s in November 2002 to pay Guccione&#x27;s personal debts, originally incurred in the Atlantic City venture. The collection had been appraised by Christie&#x27;s at $59 million two years previously. However, 9/11 had depressed the art market and the Guccione collection failed to sell for its appraised price. The aggregate sale price was $19 million, which was used to pay lender Swiss Re. Swiss Re sued Guccione in New York State Court for a $4 million shortfall on the loan balance. Much of the remaining personal collection of Bob Guccione&#x27;s art, photographs, and memorabilia was acquired by entrepreneur Jeremy Frommer in early 2012. The acquisition included over 60 original Guccione Oils, as well as the original illustrations and photographs by artists such as Arthur Cummings, Bill Lee, Suze Randall, Earl Miller, Berth Milton Sr. and more. The highlight of the collection is the quarter of a million photographs that were taken by Bob Guccione, himself, throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. The items obtained by Frommer were the inspiration for his company Jerrick Ventures LLC&#x27;s creation of the website Filthy Gorgeous Media, which debuted in June 2013.

Guccione had a history of leveraging his prized asset. He borrowed $20 million from AIG, the insurance company. Subsequently, they refinanced with Swiss Re Insurance.

==Illness and death==
By 2004, Guccione, a heavy smoker, had undergone surgery for throat cancer and stated: &quot;My cancer was only a tiny tumor about the size of an almond at the base of my tongue. The cure is probably every bit as bad as the disease. It&#x27;s affected my ability to swallow ... the mobility of my tongue ... it makes it very difficult for me to talk.&quot; Guccione was later diagnosed with terminal lung cancer and died on October 20, 2010, at the age of 79, at Plano Specialty Hospital in Plano, Texas, with his wife April at his side.

<doc id="412996" wikidata="Q1337736" url="?curid=412996" title="Jim Moran">
<text>James Patrick Moran Jr. (born May 16, 1945) is an American politician who served as the mayor of Alexandria, Virginia, from 1985 until 1990, and as the U.S. representative for , including the cities of Falls Church and Alexandria, all of Arlington County, and a portion of Fairfax County) from 1991 until 2015.

A member of the Democratic Party, Moran chaired the New Democrat Coalition from 1997 until 2001. He is of Irish descent and is the son of James Moran Sr., a former professional football player, and the brother of Brian Moran, former chairman of the Democratic Party of Virginia.

==Early life and education==
Moran was born in Buffalo, New York, the eldest of seven siblings in a Roman Catholic family of Irish descent. He grew up in Natick, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston. His parents were Dorothy (née Dwyer) and James Moran Sr., a professional football player for the Boston Redskins in 1935 and 1936; outside of football he worked as a probation officer. Both his father and mother were Roosevelt Democrats and supporters of the New Deal. Moran attended Marian High School in Framingham, Massachusetts.

Moran played college football on an athletic scholarship at the College of the Holy Cross, where his father had been a football star in the early 1930s. Moran received his B.A. in economics in 1967. After attending Baruch College of the City University of New York from 1967 to 1968, he received a Master of Public Administration from the University of Pittsburgh in 1970.

==Career==
After college, Moran followed his father&#x27;s footstep to become an amateur boxer. During a campaign in 1992, he admitted that he had used marijuana during his early 20s. Following a brief career as a stockbroker, Moran moved to Washington, D.C.

Moran worked for five years at the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare as a budget officer before serving as a senior specialist for budgetary and fiscal policy at the Library of Congress. From 1976 to 1979, he was on the staff of U.S. Senate Committee on Approrpriations.

In 1979, Moran was elected to the City Council of Alexandria, Virginia. From 1982 to 1984, he was deputy mayor. In 1984, he resigned as part of a &quot;nolo contendere&quot; plea bargain to a misdemeanor conflict of interest charge, which courts later erased. The incident stemmed from charges that Moran had used money from a political action committee to rent a tuxedo and buy Christmas cards; both of which were later judged by the Commonwealth Attorney to &quot;fit the definition of constituent services&quot;, and were dismissed.

In 1985, Moran was elected mayor of Alexandria, Virginia. He was reelected in 1988, and resigned after he was elected to Congress in November 1990.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===

In 1990, Moran first won election to the United States House of Representatives, defeating five-term Republican incumbent Stan Parris. During the campaign, Parris, referring to the issue of the Gulf War, said, &quot;The only three people I know who support Saddam Hussein&#x27;s position are Moammar Gadhafi, Yasser Arafat, and Jim Moran.&quot; Moran angrily responded by saying that Parris was &quot;a deceitful, fatuous jerk&quot;, and that he wanted &quot;to break his nose&quot;. Moran&#x27;s well-financed campaign also focused on Parris&#x27; opposition to abortion. Moran upset Parris, winning by 7.1 percent. He was sworn into office in January 1991.

In the next two elections, Moran faced Republican lawyer Kyle McSlarrow. During the 1992 campaign, McSlarrow accused Moran of &quot;lying to the public&quot;. Moran responded by portraying McSlarrow as a drug abuser, referring to the candidate&#x27;s admitted use of cocaine and marijuana while at the University of Virginia. Moran compared McSlarrow to Parris, saying that Parris had &quot;[t]en times more integrity than McSlarrow. He didn&#x27;t create lies.&quot; Moran defeated McSlarrow with 56 percent of the vote. He was helped by the 1990s redistricting, which cut out some of the more Republican-leaning areas of his district.

In 1994, Moran&#x27;s daughter Dorothy was suffering from an inoperable brain tumor. During the campaign, neither Moran nor McSlarrow used the negative tactics of two years earlier. On his campaign strategy that election, McSlarrow said &quot;It would not be a community service to shut down this campaign, but I probably will not talk much about Moran.&quot; Moran was reelected with 59 percent of the vote.

In 1998 and 2000, Moran faced Republican and flat tax advocate Demaris H. Miller. In the 1998 campaign Miller accused Moran of flip-flopping in his support of President Bill Clinton, after Moran, who had been a vocal supporter of the Clinton White House, voted in favor of opening an impeachment inquiry following the Monica Lewinsky scandal.

In 2002, Moran defeated Republican S. C. Tate and Independent R. V. Crickenberger.

In June 2004, Moran, for the first time since his election in 1990, had a Democratic opponent in a primary. Moran defeated Alexandria attorney Andrew M. Rosenberg, 59% to 41%. In November, he defeated Republican Lisa Marie Cheney.

In 2006, Moran defeated Republican challenger T. M. Odonoghue and Independent J. T. Hurysz.

In 2008, Moran again had a primary challenger; he won with 86% of the vote. In the general election, Moran faced Republican Mark Ellmore and Independent Green Ron Fisher. He won with 68 percent of the vote to Elmore&#x27;s 30 percent. In November 2009, Ellmore announced he would again challenge Moran, but dropped out of the race four months later. In the June 2010 Republican primary, attorney Matthew Berry narrowly lost to retired U.S. Army Colonel Jay Patrick Murray, after a last-minute mailing attacking Berry&#x27;s homosexuality. Fisher again was on the ballot. During the campaign, Moran was criticized by military advocacy groups and conservatives for saying, at a local Democratic committee meeting, that Murray had not &quot;served or performed any kind of public service&quot;. Moran responded by commending Murray&#x27;s military service, while saying that he used the phrase in relation to Murray not having engaged in &quot;local civic engagement&quot; and not having served in local office. In November 2010, Moran was re-elected to an eleventh term with 61% of the vote.

In 2012, Moran faced another primary challenge, from Navy veteran Bruce Shuttleworth. A controversy erupted when the Democratic Party of Virginia disqualified Shuttleworth, saying he had fallen 17 signatures short of the 1,000 threshold required. Shuttleworth cried foul and filed a federal lawsuit; the party then allowed Shuttleworth on the ballot. Moran went on to win by a sizable margin. In November, Moran defeated Republican J. Patrick Murray, Independent Jason J. Howell, and Independent Green Janet Murphy, winning 64% of the vote.

===Tenure===
Moran represented Virginia&#x27;s 8th congressional district, an area in Northern Virginia that is just across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C.; the district includes Arlington county, and the cities of Alexandria, Falls Church and parts of Fairfax County. The redistricting that followed the 2000 census also gave Moran a portion of Reston, Virginia. His district is located in the Dulles Technology Corridor and is the home of many federal defense contractors as well as a significant number of those who work in the information technology industry. Many federal employees also reside within the district, mostly due to its proximity to Washington and because the United States Department of Defense and various other agencies are headquartered there.

During the mid 1990s, Moran co-founded and later co-chaired the New Democrat Coalition, a coalition of Democratic lawmakers who consider themselves to be moderates with regard to commerce, budgeting, and economic legislation, but vote as liberals on social issues. Moran was also a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC), the largest caucus operating within the Democratic caucus, which works to advance progressive issues and opinions. He joined the caucus prior to the 111th Congress.

====1990s====
In 1995, Moran and California Republican Duke Cunningham had to be restrained by the Capitol Police after a shoving match on the house floor over President Bill Clinton&#x27;s decision to send U.S. troops to Bosnia. &quot;I thought he had been bullying too many people for too long, and I told him so ... He said he didn&#x27;t mean to be so accusatory ... After that, he would bring me candy from California&quot;, Moran claimed.

During the final years of the Clinton administration, Moran was critical of the President. In 1998, during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Moran was one of only 31 House Democrats to support launching a formal impeachment inquiry into Bill Clinton. In August 1998, he told &quot;Time&quot; magazine that, &quot;This whole sordid mess is just too tawdry and tedious and embarrassing ... It&#x27;s like a novel that just became too full of juicy parts and bizarre, sleazy characters.&quot; Moran is also reported to have told First Lady Hillary Clinton that if she had been his sister, he would have punched her husband in the nose. Moran eventually decided not to vote for impeachment, explaining that Clinton had not compromised the country&#x27;s security, and that he still respected him for what he had accomplished as President. Moran proposed a resolution demanding that Clinton confess to a pattern of &quot;dishonest and illegal conduct&quot; surrounding his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.

====21st century====
Moran was voted High Technology Legislator of the Year by the Information Technology Industry Council and was voted into the American Electronics Association Hall of Fame for his work on avoiding the Year 2000 crisis and his support of the IT Industry and defense contractors in Northern Virginia. He cosponsored failed bills in 2005 to provide the District of Columbia with a House seat and to prohibit slaughter of horses.

On April 28, 2006, Moran, along with four other members of Congress (the now-deceased Rep. Tom Lantos of California, Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, and James McGovern and John Olver of Massachusetts), and six other activists, were arrested for disorderly conduct in front of the Sudanese embassy in Washington, D.C., and spent 45 minutes in a jail cell before being released. They were protesting the alleged role of Sudan&#x27;s government in ethnic cleansing in Darfur. According to the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, &quot;Their protest and civil disobedience was designed to embarrass the military dictatorship&#x27;s ongoing genocide of its non-Arab citizens.&quot;

The day after the Virginia Tech Massacre in 2007, Moran told a local radio station that the Federal Assault Weapons Ban should be reinstated, blaming the National Rifle Association of America and President George W. Bush for blocking gun control legislation. He further warned that if gun control legislation was not passed, then shootings such as the one at Virginia Tech will happen &quot;time and time again.&quot; He later dismissed charges that he was politicizing the shooting, telling &quot;Politico&quot; that &quot;as a legislator, your immediate reaction is to think something could be done to avoid this. I don&#x27;t know why the idea of figuring out how to avoid it is a political partisan issue.&quot;

Shortly before the June 2008 Virginia Democratic primary, Moran endorsed Senator Barack Obama of Illinois for the presidency over New York Senator and former First Lady Hillary Clinton. Explaining his endorsement, he told a local newspaper that the long-term goal of closing Alexandria&#x27;s coal-fired power plant would be more attainable under Obama than under Clinton. Obama won the Virginia primary, and carried the state when he won the general election in November.
In May 2009, Moran introduced a bill that would restrict broadcast advertisements for erectile dysfunction or male enhancement medication. He said that such ads were indecent and should be prohibited on radio and television between the hours of 6 am and 10 pm, in accordance with Federal Communications Commission policy. Later that year, Moran and former presidential candidate and former Governor of Vermont Howard Dean held a town hall meeting on the issue of health care at South Lakes High School in Reston, Virginia. The meeting was interrupted several times by protesters, most notably anti-abortion activist Randall Terry, who, along with about half a dozen supporters, caused such a commotion that he had to be escorted out by police. The incident was replayed several times over the next few weeks on television as an example of the tension at town halls that fall.

In February 2010, on the House floor, Moran called for the repeal of Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell, the military policy of discharging soldiers on active duty who are openly homosexual. He spoke about a letter penned by a gay soldier who was then serving in the Afghanistan War, who had &quot;learned that a fellow soldier was also gay, only after he was killed by an IED in Iraq. The partner of the deceased soldier wrote the unit to say how much the victim had loved the military; how they were the only family he had ever known ... This immutable human trait, sexual orientation, like the color of one&#x27;s skin, does not affect one&#x27;s integrity, their honor, our commitment to their country. Soldiers serving their country in combat should not have their sacrifices compounded by having to struggle with an antiquated &quot;Don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot; policy. Let&#x27;s do the right and honorable thing and repeal this policy.&quot;

As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, Moran worked to allocate federal funding to projects in Northern Virginia, usually in the technology and defense industries. He also assisted in authorizing the replacement of the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge, a bridge between Alexandria, Virginia, and Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, which had gained a reputation over the years among Northern Virginia residents as the site of numerous rush-hour traffic jams.

On March 9, 2010, Moran was named to succeed Norm Dicks of Washington as the chairman of the House Interior and Environment Appropriations Subcommittee. The chairmanship gave Moran authority over appropriations to the Department of the Interior, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the National Endowment for the Arts; among other things. Moran said he was excited to be able to play a role in protecting the environment and conserving natural resources.

====2010s====
Moran became the ranking member of the subcommittee after the Democratic Party lost control of the House of Representatives following the November 2010 elections.

After President Obama&#x27;s 2011 State of the Union Address, Moran was interviewed by Alhurra, an Arab television network. During the interview, he said, &quot;a lot of people in [the United States of America] ... don&#x27;t want to be governed by an African-American&quot; and that the Democrats lost seats in the 2010 election for &quot;the same reason the Civil War happened in the United States ... the Southern states, particularly the slaveholding states, didn&#x27;t want to see a president who was opposed to slavery.&quot; The remarks received national media attention. &quot;The Washington Post&quot;&#x27;s Jennifer Rubin said the remarks were &quot;beyond uncivil&quot; and &quot;obnoxious&quot;.
On March 16, 2012, Moran was arrested outside the Sudanese embassy in Washington, DC, at a protest against human rights abuses perpetrated by the Sudanese government, specifically bombings in the Nuba Mountains and refusal to allow humanitarian aid organizations access to refugees. He was charged with disorderly conduct and released, along with George Clooney and several others.

On March 27, 2012, Moran introduced the AUTISM Educators Act that would implement a five-year pilot program allowing public schools to partner with colleges, universities, and non-profit organizations to promote teaching skills for educators working with high functioning students with autism. &quot;This legislation is the product of a grassroots effort by parents, instructors, school officials and caring communities,&quot; he said. &quot;Autism Spectrum Disorders are being diagnosed at an exploding rate. We have a responsibility to do everything in our power to provide the best education for our children.&quot;

In 2012, the bipartisan grassroots organization No Labels recognized Moran as a &quot;Problem Solver&quot; for &quot;continued willingness to work across the aisle and find common ground with members of the opposite party on important issues. His attitude is what Congress needs more of.&quot;

Moran joined Virginia Reps. Gerry Connolly and Bobby Scott in asking Attorney General Eric Holder for a Department of Justice investigation into allegations of voter fraud in Virginia following charges that a contractor to the Republican Party of Virginia was caught discarding completed voter registration forms in a Harrisonburg, Virginia dumpster. Shortly thereafter, conservative activist James O&#x27;Keefe released a video alleging involvement by Moran&#x27;s son in a voting fraud discussion; see #Voter fraud allegations below.

Moran occasionally appeared on MSNBC, usually on &quot;Hardball with Chris Matthews&quot; and &quot;The Ed Show&quot;.

He did not seek re-nomination to Congress in 2014, retiring after 24 years. Virginia&#x27;s former lieutenant governor, Don Beyer, a fellow Democrat, was elected to succeed Moran.

==Political positions==

===Social issues===

Moran voted against the Defense of Marriage Act, the Federal Marriage Amendment, and was in favor of repealing the military&#x27;s Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell policy. He also supported gun control, voting for the Brady Bill and supporting a reinstatement of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban. At different times he voted to ban flag-burning and partial-birth abortions, though he reversed his positions on both issues. On education, he expressed support for the public education system, universal pre-kindergarten, and full funding for the No Child Left Behind program. Moran was given a 100% rating by the NARAL and 0% by the National Right to Life Committee, indicating a pro-abortion rights voting record. He also voted to expand research of embryonic stem cells and to allow minors to go across state lines to receive abortions.

On immigration, Moran supported a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants and did not support decreasing the number of legal immigrants allowed into the country or the enforcement of federal immigration laws by state and local police. He was a cosponsor of the Comprehensive Immigration Reform ASAP Act of 2009 (H.R.4321), which the House did not pass. He was given an overall immigration reduction grade of D by NumbersUSA. The American Immigration Lawyers Association scored him as having voted 31 times for the organization&#x27;s position and 7 times against the organization&#x27;s position.

In September 2009, Moran was one of 75 members of the House of Representatives to vote no on a bill to eliminate any federal funds going to community organizer ACORN.

=== Federal employees ===
Moran introduced and supported legislation to increase benefits and pay for federal workers, in part due to the Federal Government&#x27;s large presence within the 8th District – 114,000 federal employees work within its bounds. He introduced a bill signed into law that allows FERS employees to buy back credit from a lapse in federal service toward annuity payments, with the goal of attracting individuals from the private sector back to public service. Moran also authored a law that allows a federal worker&#x27;s unused sick leave to count toward their annuity. In the 112th Congress, he also spoke against attempts by Republicans to cut back the size of the federal workforce.

=== Environment ===

Moran listed the environment as one of his top issues, citing his high marks from the League of Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club. He used his positions as a member of the Appropriations Committee and as chairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee to allocate federal funding for hiking trails and wildlife reserves in his district.

He also voted to ban logging on federal lands. He criticized the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for inaction on climate change, saying that &quot;EPA had a historic opportunity to tackle head-on one of the greatest threats to our existence—global warming. Instead they balked under pressure from the administration, concluding the problem is so complex and controversial that it cannot be resolved.&quot; He also endorsed and voted for the Clean Air Act and said that global warming is an important issue to him. In 2010, Moran also expressed discontent with President Barack Obama&#x27;s decision to allow oil drilling off the coast of the United States.

===Economy, budget, and taxes===
Moran often broke with his party on economic issues. For example, he supported Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) and other free trade agreements, harsher bankruptcy laws, and increased restrictions on the right to bring class action suits.

He voted for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) Reform and Accountability Act. He supported pay-as-you-go budgeting and believed &quot;that the American government needs to strive to build up a surplus when possible, so that there are funds to support and sustain our country during tough financial times.&quot; Moran called former President George W. Bush &quot;Fiscally irresponsible.&quot;

Moran said he supported the redistribution of wealth, saying in November 2008 that &quot;We have been guided by a Republican administration who believes in this simplistic notion that people who have wealth are entitled to keep it and they have an antipathy towards the means of redistributing wealth.&quot; He also said on his website that the recession was largely &quot;a result of the imbalance in the distribution of wealth over the last eight years and an absence of oversight and accountability.&quot;

=== Social programs ===
Moran called Social Security &quot;a safe, stable, and dependable source of financial assistance for retirees and their families,&quot; and strongly opposes privatizing Social Security, saying that it would &quot;cripple the system&quot;. It was his position that any changes to the current system must &quot;promote its long-term solvency without disrupting the core principles on which the program was founded.&quot;

Moran expressed support for Universal Healthcare and more specifically the public health insurance option, saying at a town hall meeting in Reston, Virginia, in August 2009 that &quot;It could do the most to bring down long-term medical costs and to adequately insure every American.&quot; Moran ultimately voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which passed and was signed into law in March 2010.

=== Defense ===
Moran voted against authorizing the Iraq War in 2002 and did not support the troop increase for the Afghanistan War proposed by President Barack Obama in 2009, saying first that he appreciated Obama&#x27;s &quot;careful consideration regarding the U.S.&#x27;s engagement in Afghanistan&quot;, but later defining the issues on which he and the President disagreed:

Our security concern is Al-Qaeda, not the Taliban. Eight years ago we went into Afghanistan to eliminate al-Qaeda and the &quot;safe haven&quot; that Afghanistan&#x27;s Taliban were providing the terrorist group responsible for the 9/11 attacks. Al-Qaeda has no significant presence today in all of Afghanistan. ... Instead of increasing our troop presence, the U.S. should limit its mission in Afghanistan to securing strategic Afghan population centers with the troops currently on the ground.

====Comments prior to the invasion of Iraq====
Prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Moran told an anti-war audience in Reston, Virginia, that if

If it were not for the strong support of the Jewish community for this war with Iraq, we would not be doing this. The leaders of the Jewish community are influential enough that they could change the direction of where this is going, and I think they should.

This brought criticism from many of his own party, including, among others, Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle and Senator Joe Lieberman. Nancy Pelosi, who was House Minority Leader at the time, remarked that &quot;Moran&#x27;s comments have no place in the Democratic Party.&quot;

Moran apologized for the remarks, saying that

I should not have singled out the Jewish community and regret giving any impression that its members are somehow responsible for the course of action being pursued by the administration, or are somehow behind an impending war ... What I was trying to say is that if more organizations in this country, including religious groups, were more outspoken against war, then I do not think we would be pursuing war as an option.

=== BRAC ===
Moran voted against BRAC 2005 which would move over 20,000 workers to Ft. Belvoir. The Army later decided to relocate approximately 6,400 Department of Defense workers to the Mark Center building in Alexandria. Moran opposed the selection of the Mark Center saying &quot;I&#x27;m very disappointed ... It belonged at the Springfield site.&quot; Moran blocked federal funding for an HOV ramp directly to the Mark Center citing the impact upon Winkler Preserve.

At Moran&#x27;s request, DoD ultimately delayed moving all workers to the Mark Center by one year. To help prevent gridlock, Moran got $20 million in short- and mid-term road improvements and a parking limit at the Mark Center of approximately 2,000 cars Moran also got $180 million to widen route 1 for the new Ft. Belvoir Hospital, an effort Sen. Webb called &quot;a tribute to Congressman Moran&#x27;s persistence.&quot;

=== Animal rights ===
Moran was in favor of stronger prohibitions against animal fighting. He sponsored legislation to penalize those who &quot;knowingly attend animal fights and allow minors to attend.&quot; He sponsored legislation limiting federal funding for horse slaughter inspection plants, effectively preventing the practice. In the past he promoted reinstating a five-year ban on slaughtering horses for food, noting that &quot;horses hold an important place in our nation&#x27;s history and culture ... they deserve to be cared for, not killed for foreign consumption.&quot; Moran in the past promoted safer keeping and treatment of exotic animals used in circus performances. In October 2014, Moran received the Lord Houghton Award from Cruelty Free International for his service and contribution to animal welfare.

=== Other ===
Moran does not support granting statehood to the District of Columbia. However, he voted to allow Washington, D.C., to send a voting representative to the United States Congress.

==Controversies==

===MBNA loan===

Moran&#x27;s support for harsher bankruptcy law provisions and sponsorship of stricter bankruptcy legislation brought allegations in 2002 that his support came in return for financial favors by financial institutions which could benefit from such laws. In January 1998, one month before he introduced the legislation, credit card bank MBNA advocated that it would restrict the ability of consumer debtors to declare bankruptcy. Moran received a $447,000 debt consolidation loan at over 10% interest rate.

The Lieutenant Governor of Virginia at the time, Tim Kaine, joined Republican lawmakers in calling for a House Ethics Committee investigation into the loan, saying that Moran had made &quot;an error in judgment&quot; by accepting it. In his own defense, Moran said that the timing of the legislation&#x27;s introduction was coincidental and had nothing to do with the loan. MBNA spokesman Brian Dalphon said that the bank had offered the mortgage package not knowing that Moran was a member of Congress, and that the loan &quot;made good business sense&quot; because with the mortgage loan, &quot;we improved our position by getting security for an unsecured loan. ... He had credit cards with us, he was having financial difficulties; this put him in a better position to be able to pay us back from a cash-flow standpoint.&quot;

===PMA group===

The House Ethics Committee investigated several members of the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, including Moran, Peter J. Visclosky, Norm Dicks, Marcy Kaptur and the late John Murtha, who was the chairman at the time, for a conflict of interest in the allocation of the government contracts to clients of the PMA Group, which donated nearly a million dollars to Moran&#x27;s political action committee, as well as a significant amount of money to the gubernatorial campaign of Moran&#x27;s younger brother, Brian. Moran said that he was unaware of &quot;who made donations&quot;, and &quot;how much they gave&quot;, and therefore was not affected by the donations when allocating the funding.

In February 2010, the panel cleared Moran and the others, saying that they violated no laws. The panel concluded, as part of its 305-page report, that &quot;simply because a member sponsors an earmark for an entity that also happens to be a campaign contributor ... does not support a claim that a member&#x27;s actions are being influenced by campaign contributions&quot;. After PMA&#x27;s founder, Paul Magliocchetti, pleaded guilty in September 2010 to six years of campaign finance fraud, Moran said that he would not return the $177,700 in PMA Group-related donations that he received from 1990 to 2010.

===Insider trading===
In November 2011, author Peter Schweizer published a book, &quot;Throw Them All Out&quot;, which included an allegation that Moran used information he got from a September 16, 2008 briefing, in which Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke warned of what became the financial crisis of 2007–2008, for his stock market activity:

Schweizer alleged that Moran made more than 90 trades that day. Moran defended himself by citing that the trades were made in the midst of the Great Recession and that all one had to do was turn on the television to see that stock prices were dropping fast.

===Voter fraud allegations===
On October 24, 2012 a video was released showing Patrick B. Moran, the Congressman&#x27;s son and a field director with his father&#x27;s campaign, discussing a plan to cast fraudulent ballots. It was proposed to him by someone who posed as a fervent supporter of the campaign. In response to the person&#x27;s suggestion about trying to cast votes using the names of 100 inactive voters, Patrick Moran attempted to discourage the scheme, but also discussed the practical difficulties of forging documentation such as utility bills. The person he was speaking with was actually a conservative activist with James O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s Project Veritas, and was secretly recording the conversation. Patrick Moran resigned from the campaign, saying he didn&#x27;t want to be a distraction during the election, and stating, &quot;at no point have I, or will I ever endorse any sort of illegal or unethical behavior. At no point did I take this person seriously. He struck me as being unstable and joking, and for only that reason did I humor him. In hindsight, I should have immediately walked away, making it clear that there is no place in the electoral process for even the suggestion of illegal behavior, joking or not.&quot;

The following day, the Arlington County Police Department opened a criminal probe into the matter. Two days after the video was released, the Virginia State Board of Elections asked Attorney General of Virginia Ken Cuccinelli to investigate Moran&#x27;s campaign for voter fraud. On January 31, 2013, Arlington County announced that the investigation, by its police department in collaboration with the Offices of the Virginia Attorney General and the Arlington County Commonwealth&#x27;s Attorney, had concluded and that no charges would be brought. The County stated: &quot;Patrick Moran and the Jim Moran for Congress campaign provided full cooperation throughout the investigation. Despite repeated attempts to involve the party responsible for producing the video, they failed to provide any assistance.&quot;

=== Anti-Semitism and the Iraq War ===
In 2003, Moran drew criticism for telling an audience in Reston, Virginia that “if it were not for the strong support of the Jewish community for this war with Iraq, we would not be doing this.&quot; The comment was condemned by then House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and then Democratic Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle. In 2007, Moran again generated controversy for linking the Jewish community with the war, this time by blaming AIPAC for American involvement in Iraq, telling the progressive Jewish magazine Tikkun that “… AIPAC is the most powerful lobby and has pushed this war from the beginning … because they are so well organized, and their members are extraordinarily powerful – most of them are quite wealthy – they have been able to exert power.” The comments were again condemned by Democratic leadership as anti-semitic.

==Later career==
In February 2015, Moran joined McDermott Will &amp; Emery as a senior legislative advisor. He later left the firm and became a senior policy advisor in the Washington, D.C. office of Nelson Mullins Riley &amp; Scarborough. In April 2023, he started his own lobbying firm, Moran Global Strategies, representing clients such as Qatar, Biafran separatist Simon Ekpa and various defense contractors.

Virginia Tech announced in April 2016 that Moran had joined the School of Public and International Affairs as professor of practice.

==Personal life==
Moran has been married and divorced three times. His second wife, Mary Howard Moran, filed for divorce in 1999, one day after an argument at the couple&#x27;s Alexandria home that resulted in a visit from the police. The Congressman provided his own divorce papers a few months later, and in 2003 the couple officially separated. He remarried in 2004 to real estate developer LuAnn Bennett. In December 2010, Moran and Bennett announced they were separating.

Moran is the father of four children. A son, Patrick B. Moran, once worked as a field director for one of Moran&#x27;s election campaigns but resigned in 2012 when allegations of voter fraud surfaced. Later in 2012, Patrick pleaded guilty to simple assault after being arrested after an incident with his girlfriend in front of a Columbia Heights bar on December 1. He was sentenced to probation.

Another one of Moran&#x27;s children is Dorothy, who was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor during her father&#x27;s campaign for reelection against Kyle McSlarrow in 1994. It was said at the time that she had only a twenty percent chance of living to age five, but after almost two years of chemotherapy and herbal therapies she was declared cancer-free.

His brother, Brian Moran, is a former member of the Virginia House of Delegates, and the head of the Virginia Democratic Party between early 2011 and December 2012. He was an unsuccessful primary candidate for Governor of Virginia in the 2009 election.

<text>Marr () is one of six committee areas in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. It has a population of 34,038 (2001 census). Someone from Marr is called a &quot;Màrnach&quot; in Scottish Gaelic.

== Etymology ==
The genesis of the name &quot;Marr&quot; is uncertain. &quot;Mar&quot;, a Brittonic personal name, may be involved. Further possibilities include a connection with the ethnic names &quot;Marsi&quot; and &quot;Marsigni&quot; of Italy and Bohemia, or a derivation from Old Norse &quot;marr&quot; meaning &quot;sea, marsh, fen&quot;.

American academic Thomas Clancy has noted cautiously the similarity between the territory names &quot;Buchan&quot; and &quot;Marr&quot; to those of the Welsh commotes &quot;Cantref Bychan&quot; and &quot;Cantref Mawr&quot;, meaning &quot;large commote&quot; and &quot;small commote&quot;, respectively. Linguist Guto Rhys adjudged the proposal &quot;appealing&quot; but &quot;questionable&quot;, on the basis that the form &quot;Marr&quot; conflicts with the expected development of &quot;mawr&quot;. 
== Features ==
To the west, the mountain environment of the Cairngorms National Park sustains a well-developed tourist industry based on heritage and outdoor pursuits. Forestry and livestock farming are key industries, particularly in remoter areas. Part of the area has qualified for EU financial assistance. To the east, Marr has experienced population growth due to its strong commuter links with the city of Aberdeen.

The committee area consists of three wards of Aberdeenshire council:
*Aboyne, Upper Deeside and Donside
*Banchory and Mid-Deeside
*Huntly, Strathbogie and Howe of Alford

Between them the three wards elect ten councillors to the 68-member council.
==Historic province==
Marr is named after Mar, one of the historic provinces of Scotland, extending from north of the Don southward to the Mounth. Like other such areas, it was under the rule of a mormaer in the Middle Ages. In the 12th century an earl (the Earl of Mar) took his place, but no definite succession of earls appears until the 13th century, nor has any genealogical connection been established between them and the mormaers.

In the eleventh century Malcolm III introduced the office of sheriff to Scotland. He and his successors Edgar, Alexander I and in particular David I established sheriffdoms throughout the country. In the mid-19th century, local government reforms replaced the ancient provinces with new counties (&quot;shires&quot;), aligned to sheriffdom boundaries; hence, Marr became the southern portion of the shire of Aberdeen.

<doc id="413003" wikidata="Q918794" url="?curid=413003" title="British Bankers' Association">
<text>The British Bankers&#x27; Association (BBA) was a trade association for the UK banking and financial services sector. From 1 July 2017, it was merged into UK Finance.

It represented members from a wide range of banking and financial services. The association lobbied for its members and gave its view on the legislative and regulatory system for banking in the UK.

==History==

The BBA was founded in 1919 by the merger of two pre-existing bodies, the Central Association of Bankers (est. 1895 in London, 34 St Clements Lane) and the Association of English Country Bankers (est. 1874 and itself one of the Central Association&#x27;s founders). Until 1972, the BBA was only open to British domestic, colonial and dominion banks. In 1972, it opened itself to all banks operating in the United Kingdom. In 1975 responsibility for money transmission services moved to Association for Payment Clearing Services (APACS) (which became UK Payments Administration (UKPA) in 2009). In 1991, the Committee of London Clearing Bankers (est. 1821), which in 1985 had been renamed the Committee of London and Scottish Bankers, was subsumed into the BBA.

==Role==

The BBA described itself as the leading trade association for the UK banking sector with more than 230 member banks headquartered in over 50 countries with operations in 180 jurisdictions worldwide.

==Structure==
The BBA was a trade association owned and governed by its members.

===BBA board===
The board was the governing body of the Association. It agreed major strategies and policies.

===Member segment advisory boards===
Member segment advisory boards provided a forum to inform the agenda of the BBA board and policy committees. There was a member segment advisory board for the major retail banks, challenger banks, small banks, major international wholesale banks, foreign banks, private banks and wealth management, and custody banking.

===High-level committees===
The BBA had four high-level committees, representing retail policy, financial policy and risk, wholesale policy, and corporate policy.

===Technical panels and working groups===
Below its board, member segment advisory boards and high-level committees, the BBA had a number of technical panels and working parties.

==Activity==
The BBA responded to the full range of issues affecting retail and wholesale banking and the wider financial services industry. As well as its interaction with current affairs, it worked to form and reform lasting policy decisions.

===Products and services===

====BBA LIBOR====

LIBOR (the London Interbank Offered Rate) was the primary benchmark for short-term interest rates. It indicates the average rate at which a leading bank can obtain unsecured funding for a given period in a given currency. It, therefore, represents the lowest real-world cost of unsecured funding in the London market. As such, LIBOR was one of the fundamental standards for global financial markets.

Prior to September, 2012, BBA LIBOR was calculated and published by Thomson Reuters on behalf of the BBA. In July 2012, it came out that LIBOR had been systematically rigged by Barclays for many years, leading to the LIBOR scandal. Paul Tucker, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, compared the BBA LIBOR market to a &quot;cesspit&quot; of dishonesty. In September, 2012, it was decided that the BBA would be stripped of its role in LIBOR rate setting. Martin Wheatley said &quot;the BBA acts as the lobby organisation for the same submitting banks that they nominally oversee, creating a conflict of interest that precludes strong and credible governance&quot;.

====Events and training====
In 2014 the BBA held 67 events attracting over 4,500 attendees. This included the association&#x27;s annual conference and annual industry dinners, as well as a number of forums, briefings and training courses.

====High street banking statistics====
The BBA produced a monthly report on High Street banking figures which is used by banks and by the media. This data informed the BBA Annual Abstract of Banking Statistics which was published each August.

====Global Operational Loss Database (GOLD)====
The BBA managed the Global Operational Loss Database (GOLD) for its members. GOLD is an important tool for managing operational risk.

====SME support====
In line with the UK government&#x27;s drive to support UK business, the BBA was a committed participant in the Business Growth Fund.

The BBA was leading efforts to increase funding to small and medium-sized enterprises through the Better Business Finance campaign. The BBA collaborated with the British Chambers of Commerce to deliver 15 outreach events across the UK throughout 2011 in support of this initiative.

Better Business Finance is complemented by the website Mentorsme, an online gateway through which small and medium businesses can connect with mentoring organisations and individuals working in their area.

====Lost accounts====
The BBA had responsibility for a number of personal and business customer services. These included the website My Lost Account, a free service that helps customers trace their lost accounts and savings.

==== BBA Strategy 2013-2015====
The BBA&#x27;s three core priorities were helping customers, promoting growth and raising standards. Its strategy document gives further details about the Association&#x27;s aims and values.

==== BBA Brief====
The BBA Brief was a daily two-minute summary of the banking news that mattered sent at 10am.

==Organisation==
Anthony Browne succeeded Angela Knight as chief executive on 1 September 2012. In April 2017, he announced he was stepping down after five years as CEO, when the BBA merged with five other trade associations to form UK Finance.

<doc id="413007" wikidata="Q621356" url="?curid=413007" title="Apple displays">
<text>Apple Inc. has sold a variety of LCD and CRT computer displays since introducing their first display in 1980. Apple paused production of their own standalone displays in 2016 and partnered with LG to design displays for Macs. In June 2019, the Pro Display XDR was introduced, however it was expensive and targeted for professionals. In March 2022, the Studio Display was launched as a consumer-targeted counterpart. These are currently the only Apple-branded displays available.

== CRT displays ==
In the beginning (throughout the 1970s), Apple did not manufacture or sell displays of any kind, instead recommending users plug-into their television sets or (then) expensive third party monochrome monitors. However, in order to offer complete systems through its dealers, Apple began to offer various displays including the 1981 Monitor ///, which they manufactured in-house and paired perfectly with the Apple ///. Apple then went on to supply a rebadged third party manufactured monitor that paired perfectly with the Apple //e, the Monitor //. 

===First generation===
Apple&#x27;s manufacture history of CRT displays began in 1980, starting with the Monitor /// that was introduced alongside and matched the Apple III business computer. It was a 12″ monochrome (green) screen that could display 80×24 text characters and any type of graphics, however it suffered from a very slow phosphor refresh that resulted in a &quot;ghosting&quot; video effect. So it could be shared with Apple II computers, a plastic stand was made available to accommodate the larger footprint of the display.

Three years later came the introduction of the Apple manufactured Apple Monitor II, which as the name implies, was more suited in look and style for the Apple II line and at the same time added improvements in features and visual quality. In 1984 a miniature 9″ screen, called the Monitor IIc, was introduced for the Apple IIc computer to help complement its compact size. This display was also the first to use the brand new design language for Apple&#x27;s products called &quot;Snow White&quot;, as well as being the first display not in a beige color, but rather a bright, creamy off-white. By early 1985 came the first color CRTs, starting with the Monitor 100, a digital RGB display for the Apple III and Apple IIe (with appropriate card), followed shortly by the 14″ ColorMonitor IIe (later renamed to &quot;AppleColor Composite Monitor IIe&quot;) and ColorMonitor IIc (later renamed to &quot;AppleColor Composite Monitor IIc&quot;), composite video displays for those respective models. All of these Apple displays support the maximum Apple II Double Hi-Res standard of 560×192.

In 1986 came the introduction of the AppleColor RGB Monitor, a 12″ analog RGB display designed specifically for the Apple IIGS computer. It supported a resolution of 640×400 interlaced (640×200 non-interlaced) and could be used by the Macintosh II, in a limited fashion, with the &quot;Apple High Resolution Display Video Card&quot;. Also introduced that year was the Apple Monochrome Monitor, which cosmetically was identical to the former model but was a black and white composite display suitable in external appearance for the Apple II, Apple IIc or Apple IIc Plus.

===Second generation===
The second generation of displays were built into the Lisa and Macintosh computers. The Macintosh had a 9-inch monochrome display that could display 512×342 pixels which would be used in all monochrome Compact Macintosh computers.

In 1987, Apple released two new monitors for use with the Macintosh II. The AppleColor High-Resolution RGB Monitor had a 13″ Trinitron CRT (the first Apple display to use an aperture grille CRT) with a fixed resolution of 640×480 pixels. The Apple High-Resolution Monochrome Monitor was a 12″ CRT that supported up to 256 shades of gray at a fixed resolution of 640x480. The Macintosh II was a modular system with no internal display and was able to drive up to six displays simultaneously using multiple graphics cards. The desktop spanned multiple displays, and windows could be moved between displays or straddle them. In 1989, Apple introduced two additional monochrome displays for the Macintosh, the 20″ Macintosh Two Page Monochrome Display which could display two pages side by side and the 15″ Macintosh Portrait Display with a vertical orientation to display one page. In 1990, two 12″ displays were introduced for the low end, a 640×480 monochrome model and a 512×384 color model (560×384 for compatibility with Apple IIe Card), meant for the Macintosh LC. These were succeeded by the Macintosh Color Display series in 1992, which came in 14&quot;, 16&quot; and 20&quot; models, with resolutions of 640×480, 832×624, and 1152×870 respectively. There was also the Apple Performa Plus Display (a low-end Goldstar-built 14″ display with 640×480 resolution) for the Macintosh Performa series and the Apple Color Plus 14″ Display.
===Third generation===

The third generation of displays marked the end of the monochrome display era and the beginning of the multimedia era. The first display to include built-in speakers was introduced in 1993 as the Apple AudioVision 14 Display. The &quot;Multiple Scan&quot; series of displays began with the Multiple Scan 17 and 20 with Trinitron CRTs and the Multiple Scan 14 with shadow mask CRT, and would ultimately become Apple&#x27;s value line of shadow mask displays. The AppleVision series of displays then became the high-end display line, using 17″ and 20″ Trinitron CRTs and with AV versions containing integrated speakers. The AppleVision line was later renamed to &quot;ColorSync&quot; display line when Steve Jobs returned to Apple.

The Macintosh Color Classic introduced a 10″ color Trinitron display to the Classic compact Macintosh, with a slightly enhanced resolution of 512×384 (560×384 to accommodate the Apple IIe Card) like the standalone 12″ color display. Apple continued the all-in-one series with the larger 14″ Macintosh LC 500 series, featuring a 14″, 640×480 Trinitron CRT until the LC 580 in 1995, which heralded the switch to shadow mask CRTs for the remainder of Apple&#x27;s all-in-one computers until the switch to LCDs in 2002. The last Macintosh to include an integrated CRT was the eMac, which boosted the display area to 17″ with support up to 1280×960 resolution. It used a 4th generation flat-screen CRT and was discontinued in 2006.

===Fourth generation===
The fourth generation of displays were introduced simultaneously with the Blue &amp; White Power Macintosh G3 in 1999, which included the translucent plastics of the iMac (initially white and blue &quot;blueberry&quot;, then white and grey &quot;graphite&quot; upon the introduction of the Power Mac G4). The displays were also designed with same translucent look. The &quot;Apple Studio Display&quot; series of CRT displays were available in a 17″ Diamondtron and a 21″ Trinitron CRT, both driven by an LG-Manufactured chassis. The 17″ displays were notorious for faulty flybacks and failing in a manner that could destroy the monitor and catch fire. It&#x27;s also reported that these monitors can destroy GPUs, and sometimes the entire computer. The last Apple external CRT display was introduced in 2000 along with the Power Mac G4 Cube. Both it and the new &quot;LCD Studio Displays&quot; featured clear plastics to match the Cube, and the new Apple Display Connector, which provided power, USB, and video signals to the display through a single cable. It was available only in a 17″ flat screen Diamondtron CRT. It was discontinued the following year.

== Flat panel displays ==
The history of Apple LCDs started in 1984 when the Apple Flat Panel Display was introduced for the Apple IIc computer, principally to enhance the IIc&#x27;s portability (see Apple IIc Portability enhancements). This monochrome display was capable of 80 columns by 24 lines, as well as double hi-res graphics, but had an odd aspect ratio (making images look vertically squished) and required a very strong external light source, such as a desk lamp or direct sunlight to be used. Even then it had a very poor contrast overall and was quite expensive (US$600), contributing to its poor sales and consequently it dropping from the market not long after its introduction. An estimated 10,000 IIc LCD displays were produced.

===Portable displays===
The next attempt at a flat panel was with the Macintosh Portable. More of a &quot;luggable&quot; than a laptop, it contained a high-resolution, active-matrix, 1-bit black &amp; white, 9.8″ LCD with 640×400 resolution. Like the IIc Flat Panel, it was not backlit and required a bright light source to be used. A second generation model employed a backlit LCD. The PowerBook and MacBook series would continue to use LCD displays, following an industry-wide evolution from black-and-white to grayscale to color and ranging from 9″ to 17″. Two primary technologies were used, active matrix (higher quality and more expensive) and passive matrix displays (lower quality and cheaper). By 1998 all laptops would use active-matrix color LCDs, though the Newton products and eMate portables would continue to use black and white LCDs. Apple&#x27;s current MacBook portable displays include LED backlighting and support either 2560×1600 or 2880×1800 pixel resolutions depending on screen size. The iPod series used black-and-white or color LCDs, the iPhone line uses LCD and OLED displays, and the Apple Watch uses OLED.

===All-In-Ones===
In 1997, Apple released the Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh (TAM), its first all-in-one desktop with an LCD display. Drawing heavily from PowerBook technology, the TAM featured a 12.1″ active matrix LCD capable of displaying up to 16 bit color at 800×600. While Apple chose to retain traditional and cheaper CRTs for its all-in-one desktop line for the next 4 years, the TAM is undoubtedly the predecessor for the successful LCD-based iMac line of all-in-one desktops starting with the iMac G4 released in 2002. A substantial upgrade over the TAM, it contained a 15″ LCD supporting up to 1024×768 resolution. It was followed by a 17″ and 20″ models boasting resolution of up to 1680 × 1050. In 2005, the iMac G5 dropped the 15″ configuration and in 2007, the new iMac dropped the 17″ and added a 24″ to the line-up, further boosting resolution to 1920 x 1200. In October 2009, new iMac models moved to 16:9 aspect ratio screens at 21.5 and 27 inches.

===External displays===
The first desktop color flat-panel was introduced on March 17, 1998, with the 15″ Apple Studio Display (15-inch flat panel) which had a resolution of 1024×768. After the eMate, it was one of the first Apple products to feature translucent plastics, two months before the unveiling of the iMac. Apple called its dark blue color &quot;azul&quot;. It had a DA-15 input as well as S-video, composite video, ADB and audio connectors, though no onboard speakers. In January 1999 the coloring was changed to match the blue and white of the new Power Macintosh G3s, and the connector changed to DE-15 VGA.

The 22″ widescreen Apple Cinema Display was introduced in August 1999, simultaneously with the Power Mac G4 and in the beginning was sold only as an option to the Power Mac G4, selling for US$3,999. It had a native resolution of 1600×1024 and used a DVI connector. The display had a striped look on the bezel, similar to previous Studio Displays and iMacs. In December, the colors of the 15″ display were changed to &quot;graphite&quot; to match the new Power Mac G4s, and the input was changed from VGA to DVI, the audio and video features dropped, and the ADB functionality replaced by a two-port USB hub.

In 2000 the 22″ Cinema Displays switched to the ADC interface, and the 15″ Studio Display was remodeled to match the Cinema Display&#x27;s easel-like form factor and also featured the Apple Display Connector. In 2001 an LCD-based 17″ Studio Display was introduced, with a resolution of 1280×1024.

In 2002 Apple introduced the Cinema Display HD which had a 23″ widescreen display with a resolution of 1920×1200. In 2003 Apple introduced the 20″ Cinema Display with a resolution of 1680×1050 to replace the discontinued 22″ display.

In 2004 a new line was introduced, utilizing the same 20″ and 23″ panels alongside a new 30″ model, for $3,299. The displays had a sleek aluminum enclosure with a much narrower bezel than their predecessors. The 20″ model featured a 1680×1050 resolution, the 23″ 1920×1200, and the 30″ 2560×1600. The 30″ version requires a dual-link interface, because a single-link DVI connection (the most common type) doesn&#x27;t have enough bandwidth to provide a picture to a display of this resolution. Initially, the only graphics cards that could power the new 30″ display were the Nvidia GeForce 6800 DDL series, available in both GT and Ultra forms. The DDL suffix signified the dual-link DVI capability. The less expensive of the two cards retailed for US$499, raising the net cost of owning and using the display to nearly $3,800. Later graphics options included the NVIDIA Quadro FX 4500; the card included two dual-link DVI connectors which allowed a Power Mac G5 to run two 30″ Cinema Displays simultaneously with the total number of pixels working out to 8.2 million.

In 2006 along with the introduction of the Mac Pro, Apple lowered the price of the 30″ Cinema Display to US$1999. The Mac Pro featured an NVIDIA GeForce 7300GT as the graphics card in its base configuration which is capable of running a 30″ Cinema Display and another 23″ display simultaneously. The original Mac Pro was also available with both the ATI Radeon X1900XT card and the NVIDIA Quadro FX 4500 as build-to-order options. The X1900XT and FX 4500 are each capable of driving two 30″ Cinema Displays.

===LED Cinema Display===
With the introduction of the Unibody MacBook family, Apple introduced the 24-inch LED Cinema Display, its first desktop display to use the new Mini DisplayPort connector, and also the first with an LED-backlit LCD. It had built-in speakers, a powered 3-port USB hub on the rear, an iSight camera and microphone, and a MagSafe power adapter for laptops. It also connected by USB for peripherals. It has a resolution of 1920×1200 and retailed for US$899.00. In 2010 it was replaced with a new 27-inch version with a resolution of 2560×1440.

===Thunderbolt Display===
In 2011 Apple released the Apple Thunderbolt Display, replacing the Mini DisplayPort and USB connector with a Thunderbolt plug for display and data. A Gigabit Ethernet port, a FireWire 800 port and a Thunderbolt 2 port were added as well, and the iSight camera was upgraded with a 720p FaceTime camera. On June 23, 2016, Apple announced it had discontinued the Thunderbolt Display, ending Apple&#x27;s production of standalone displays.

===LG UltraFine===

After Apple discontinued production of standalone displays in 2016, they partnered with LG to design the UltraFine line, with a 21.5-inch 4096x2304 display (22MD4KA-B) and 27-inch 5120x2880 display (27MD5KA-B), released in November 2016 alongside the Thunderbolt 3-enabled MacBook Pro. Both displays use a USB-C connector, with the 27-inch version integrating Thunderbolt 3 connectivity. On the rear of the displays is a three port USB-C hub. The 21.5-inch version provides up to 60W charging power, while the 27-inch provides up to 85W. The 21.5-inch is compatible with all Macs with a USB-C port, while the 27-inch version can only be used natively at full resolution with Macs with Thunderbolt 3, which includes all Macs with USB-C except the Retina MacBook. The 27-inch model is compatible with older Thunderbolt 2-equipped Macs using an adapter, but is limited to displaying their maximum output resolution. Both models include integrated stereo speakers, while the 27-inch model also includes a 1080p FaceTime-compatible camera. Like previous Apple displays, there are no physical buttons on the display, and brightness and speaker volume are controlled by a connected computer.

Reviews of the UltraFine displays praised their image and sound quality and macOS integration, but criticized their design, build quality, and lack of cable management and USB-A ports. LG acknowledged that early production 5K models lacked shielding for radio interference and could become inoperable if placed near a wireless router and introduced a repair program.

In May 2019, the 21.5-inch model was discontinued and replaced with a 23.7-inch 3840x2160 model (24MD4KL-B) which added Thunderbolt 3 connectivity, auto-brightness, and increased the power output to 85W. In July 2019, the 27-inch model (27MD5KL-B, 27MD5KB-B) was updated with USB-C video input, adding compatibility with the 3rd generation iPad Pro at 4K resolution, auto-brightness, and increased power output to 94W. Apple stopped selling the displays in March 2022 following the release of the Apple Studio Display, but the displays are still in production and sold by LG.

===Pro Display XDR===

Apple announced the Pro Display XDR at the 2019 WWDC, the first Apple-branded display since the Apple Thunderbolt Display was discontinued in 2016. The display contains a 6016×3384 6K color-calibrated Extreme Dynamic Range (XDR) panel.

===Studio Display===
Apple announced the Apple Studio Display at the March 2022 Apple Special Event. It features a 27-inch, 5K Retina monitor, with 5120-by-2880 resolution at 218 pixels per inch, 600 nits brightness, wide color (P3), and True Tone technology.
==Connectors==
Apple has employed a large number of display connector designs over the years:

*Original DA-15 (commonly but incorrectly known as a DB-15) used on all modular desktop Macs until the 1999 Blue and White Power Macintosh G3.
*A 13W3 connector (as on Sun Microsystems machines) used on the Macintosh Portrait Display
*A non-standard &quot;mini-15&quot; connector used on early PowerBooks which allowed an Apple display to be attached via a short adaptor cable.
*The HDI-45 used on some &quot;AV&quot; model Centris, Quadra and the first-generation (NuBus) Power Macintosh machines.
*Standard 15-pin high-density DE-15 VGA connector, first included on some Power Macintosh 9600 models and most PowerPC PowerBooks, and available on all current Macintoshes via a short adaptor cable.
*The Apple Display Connector (ADC), which carries DVI, VGA, USB and power in one connector, was used on the PowerMac G4 and early models of the PowerMac G5.
* A DVI connector was used on the 2001-2002 titanium PowerBook G4; all aluminum PowerBook G4 15″ and 17″; all aluminum MacBook Pro 15″ and 17″ models; Mac Mini G4, Power Mac G4, G5; Intel Mac Mini, and Mac Pro 2006–2012. The PowerBook G4 12″, iMac G5 and the first Intel-based iMacs use mini-DVI ports.
*A mini-VGA connector, which can provide VGA via a short adaptor cable. It appears on the white iBook, eMac, iMac G4 and G5, and first generation 12-inch PowerBook G4. Later models also support a composite and S-video adapter attached to this port.
*A mini-DVI connector used on the 12″ PowerBook G4 (except first generation,) Intel-based iMacs, MacBooks, and Mac Minis.
*A micro-DVI connector was used in the first generation MacBook Air to accommodate its small form factor.
* A mini DisplayPort connector was used on some MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, iMac, Mac Mini and Mac Pro models.
* Currently all Macs feature Thunderbolt connectors.
* The Retina MacBook introduced USB-C connectivity for displays. The 2016 MacBook Pro uses a combination Thunderbolt 3 USB-C connector. They are backwards compatible with HDMI and DisplayPort.

Additionally, various Apple computers have been able to output:
*S-video via standard 4-pin mini-DIN connector
*Composite video, via:
**S-video port and use of short adaptor cable (PowerBooks)
**Standard phono connector (AV Macs)
**Phono connector video out on the Apple II, II+, IIe, IIc, IIc+, IIGS, III, and III+. While not technically NTSC or PAL compatible, a suitable image would display on NTSC/PAL television monitors
**A non-standard 3.5 mm jack that functions as either a headphone jack, or stereo audio and composite video out via an adaptor cable (FireWire Special Edition Clamshell iBooks and early &quot;Dual USB&quot; iBooks with external reset button)
*S-video, Composite video, or VGA, via:
**Mini-VGA when using an Apple Video Output Adapter (S-video &amp; Composite or VGA)
*The Apple Video Adapter was specially designed to allow users to connect to S-video or composite video devices. The video adapter cable plugs into the video output port (Mini-VGA) built into the back of certain Macintosh computers. The video output port supports VGA, S-Video and Composite video out. The Apple Video Adapter is for S-Video or Composite video output only, use a separate Apple VGA Adapter for VGA video output options. With the Apple Video Adapter you can connect to your TV, VCR, or overhead projector via S-Video or Composite cables.

:Compatible with: iBook without an external reset button, 12-inch PowerBook G4, Mac Mini, eMac, iMac G5, or 17-inch iMac (1 GHz) with Mini-VGA port.

*The Apple VGA Display Adapter was specially designed to allow users to connect certain Macintosh computers to an extra VGA display or external projector (equipped with VGA) for 24-bit video-mirroring. The VGA cable from your external display or projector cable plugs into the Mini-VGA video port built into your Macintosh via the Apple VGA Display Adapter.

:Compatible with: eMac, iMac G5, iMac G4 flat-panel, 12-inch PowerBook G4, or iBooks having a Mini-VGA port. Most Macintosh computers with the Mini-VGA port can also use the Apple Video Adapter for S-video &amp; Composite output options.

*12-inch PowerBook G4 (first generation) models supported video-mirroring and extended video desktop modes through a mini-VGA port. All 15 and 17 inch PowerBook G4 models have a DVI port as well as an S-Video out port. The mini-VGA port on the 12-inch PowerBook was replaced by a mini-DVI port starting with the second revision of the machine.
*The Retina MacBook Pro supports HDMI output from a built-in connector in addition to its two Thunderbolt connectors.

<doc id="413008" wikidata="Q1346638" url="?curid=413008" title="Michael Hui">
<text>Michael Hui Koon-man (born ; 3 September 1942; also known as Mr Boo!) is a Hong Kong actor, comedian, scriptwriter and director. He is the eldest of the four Hui brothers (together with Ricky, Sam, and Stanley) who were prominent figures in the Hong Kong entertainment industry during the 1970s and the 1980s. Michael Hui is considered by many critics to be one of the foremost comedians in the Hong Kong film industry.

==Education==
Hui studied in La Salle College, and then earned a degree in sociology from the United College, the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

==Career==
After a spell hosting quiz shows on TVB, Hui gained popularity in the Hong Kong entertainment industry with his variety show stints in the &quot;Hui Brothers Show&quot;. He then moved from television to film. Hui&#x27;s first work was in a film by Taiwanese director Li Han-hsiang called &quot;The Warlord&quot; (大軍閥 or &quot;The Great Regime&quot;, 1972), where he played a farcical warlord in post-revolutionary China.

In 1974, he set up his own film company, the Hui Film Company, with Golden Harvest, with his brothers Ricky and Sam. Between 1974 and 2000 he created more than 20 comedy films, five of which were Hong Kong&#x27;s No. 1 box-office hit of the year.

The earliest Hui comedies combined episodic gags with the comedic appeal of Michael and his brothers. This usually involved the trio of actors—Michael, Sam and Ricky—pitting their wits against the odds to earn quick bucks and their livelihood. Set in modern-day Hong Kong, with upbeat soundtracks performed by Sam himself, these works became wildly popular amongst the working classes in the 1970s and early 1980s. &quot;Games Gamblers Play&quot; (1974), &quot;The Private Eyes&quot; (1976), &quot;The Contract&quot; (1978) and &quot;Security Unlimited&quot; (1981) – the last of which won him the first Hong Kong Film Award for Best Actor – are often seen as the quintessential comedies made by the company. &quot;Games Gamblers Play&quot; was a huge success when first released and paved the way for Cantonese movies to hold their own against the colonial trend of Mandarin production.

In the 1980s, Hui developed a new brand of satirical comedy, one which capitalized on his deadpan comic timing, using a more character-driven storyline. Some of his more renowned works came during this period in the 1980s. Hui frequently acted out the archetypal &quot;ne&#x27;er-do-well&quot; driven on by a cash-mad Hong Kong society. Equally caustic and funny, they are set against the backdrop of present-day Hong Kong consumerism. He would make a rare North American film appearance as the Subaru mechanic/engineer with Jackie Chan in the Burt Reynolds comedy &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot;. In &quot;Chocolate Inspector&quot; (1986), he plays a chocolate-eating inspector who must solve a kidnap case while his subordinate is involved in a Miss Hong Kong pageant. In &quot;Chicken and Duck Talk&quot; (1988), opposing restaurateurs come to blows to secure profits. &quot;Front Page&quot; (1990), which reunited the three brothers, lampoons the Hong Kong press, while &quot;The Magic Touch&quot; (1992) satirizes the Chinese obsession with fortune-telling and wealth. &quot;Always on My Mind&quot; (1993) continues in this vein of self-deprecating humour: Hui plays the head of a family, a news anchor, who will stop at nothing to grab money.

Hui continued acting and producing his own comedies, at a less prolific rate, in the 1990s and 2000s. He wrote a dozen screenplays, but none were produced because he felt dissatisfied. &quot;Chinese Box&quot; (1997), directed by Wayne Wang, remains Hui&#x27;s only starring film in the West. He played a talented safe-cracker, who kidnaped a baby for money from triads but was kind-hearted and dignified, in the action-comedy &quot;Rob-B-Hood&quot; (2006), starring alongside Jackie Chan and Louis Koo. In 2006, he became the host of the quiz show &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;. In 2016, he starred in the Taiwanese black comedy film, &quot;Godspeed&quot;, for which he is nominated the Golden Horse Award for Best Leading Actor.

Organized by the Hong Kong Arts Development Council (HKADC), the 15th Hong Kong Arts Development Awards was held on Oct 30, 2021. Hui was one of the recipients of the Award for Outstanding Contribution in Arts, for his active involvements in filmmaking as a director, a screenwriter and actor.

<doc id="413009" wikidata="Q440025" url="?curid=413009" title="Michael Rogers (cyclist)">
<text>Michael Rogers (born 20 December 1979) is an Australian retired professional road bicycle racer who competed professionally between 1999 and 2016, for the , , , and teams. He is a three-time World Time Trial Champion, winning consecutively in 2003 (after David Millar was stripped for doping), 2004 and 2005, and won Grand Tour stages at the Tour de France and the Giro d&#x27;Italia.

In April 2016, Rogers announced via Twitter, that he was being forced to retire from professional cycling due to a congenital heart defect condition which had been worsening.

==Career==
===Early career===
Rogers was part of the Australian Institute of Sport, which led him to move to Europe at age 16 as an amateur. He started as a track racer under coach Charlie Walsh.

At the 2002 Tour Down Under, Rogers&#x27; team-prepared bicycle was damaged in a collision with a motorcycle, forcing him to come to a halt by the roadside. The collision was not captured by television cameras. There were no team cars nearby and Rogers appeared visibly frustrated with the turn of events. Fortunately, spectator Adam Pyke, an amateur cyclist, offered his own Colnago bicycle as a replacement and Rogers was able to continue, needing only a minor saddle height adjustment en route from a mechanic alongside in a car. He went on to finish second on the stage, took the race lead, and ultimately went on to win the race overall. The entire episode, including swapping bicycles, was captured by the television cameras while Rogers, Pyke and the borrowed bicycle were reunited at the end of the stage by the Australian broadcaster Seven in a televised interview.

Rogers won the world time-trial championship in 2003, 2004 and 2005. He came second in 2003, but became champion after the winner, David Millar, was disqualified for doping. Rogers received his rainbow jersey and gold medal on the day of the 2004 championship, thereby receiving two gold medals on the same day.

In the 2003 Tour de France, Rogers helped Richard Virenque win his sixth mountains classification. He was the last rider left to help in Virenque&#x27;s day-long escape and stage win.

Rogers finished fourth in the road time trial at the 2004 Olympics in Athens. In May 2011 US cyclist Tyler Hamilton returned his gold medal for this event after admitting to doping during his cycling career, and in August 2012 the International Olympic Committee formally stripped Hamilton of his victory, resulting in Rogers being awarded the bronze medal. In September 2015, he received the Olympic medal in a ceremony at the IOC headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland.

===T Mobile (2006–2010)===

Rogers joined for the 2006 season, and finished 9th overall in the Tour de France. In an interview during the 2006 season, Rogers disclosed that he had received training advice by Italian doctor Michele Ferrari for several months during 2006.

On 15 July 2007, Rogers withdrew on the 8th stage of the 2007 Tour de France after breaking a collarbone in a crash descending the Cormet de Roselend. He continued until the doctor arrived from attending fellow Australian Stuart O&#x27;Grady, who ended up stretchered to hospital. It was after this that Rogers contracted infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever), which caused a dip in his racing form for some time. By late 2009 he had returned to form and began to have significant racing success, with , the successor to T-Mobile.

In 2010, as leader of his team, he won the Vuelta a Andalucía, and then the Tour of California (the first non-American to do so). After a disappointing Tour de France (37th overall), Rogers announced he would concentrate in future on shorter races (e.g. one week in length) as he was no longer suited to the longer tours.

===Team Sky (2011–2012)===
In October 2010 it was announced that he would leave and join British based for the 2011 racing season. However he suffered a relapse of his mononucleosis early in the season and was unable to defend his 2010 Tour of California title. Rogers returned to fitness towards the end of the season.

Rogers began the 2012 season with third place in the Australian National Time Trial Championships, and led at the Tour Down Under, where he finished 4th in the general classification. In March, Rogers finished third at the Critérium International; he placed second to &#x27;s Cadel Evans in the individual time trial around Porto-Vecchio, and finished eighth on the final stage, the summit finish of the . After finishing fifth in April&#x27;s Tour de Romandie, Rogers won May&#x27;s Bayern Rundfahrt stage race in Germany, winning Stage 2 and the time trial Stage 4 in the process, his first victories whilst riding for . Rogers then rode the Critérium du Dauphiné, helping leader Bradley Wiggins win the race, whilst finishing second overall himself after a strong ride in the time trial. Rogers was selected in the squad for the Tour de France, as one of Wiggins&#x27; key domestiques. He suffered a crash towards the end of Stage 1, but was able to make it back to the peloton. Rogers played a key team role in the rest of the race, setting the tempo on mountains and notably bringing back a long range attack by Cadel Evans on Stage 11, as Sky ultimately achieved a 1–2 finish in the GC with Wiggins and Chris Froome.

===Team Saxo–Tinkoff (2013–2016)===

Rogers left Sky to join in 2012 following a new Sky policy requiring all riders to sign to confirm they have no history of doping although he denied leaving for that reason.

In May, Rogers was the runner-up to Tejay van Garderen in the Tour of California. In July Rogers rode the Tour de France in support of Alberto Contador and finished in 16th place. In October he won the Japan Cup one-day race. In December it was announced that he had tested positive for clenbuterol at the latter race, and was suspended from cycling pending further investigation. On 23 April 2014 the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) announced he would be cleared of any wrongdoing, no further action would be taken and that Rogers would be free to race again. The UCI accepted that there was a significant probability that the clenbuterol came from contaminated meat consumed while Rogers was competing in China, where the drug is often consumed by animals in slaughterhouses to exhibit better performance in farm sporting events.

He returned to racing just in time to ride the 2014 Giro d&#x27;Italia. Throughout much of the race, he rode in support of Rafał Majka. He won his first Grand Tour individual stage on the eleventh stage and also won the penultimate stage summit finish at the Monte Zoncolan. On 22 July 2014, Rogers won his first Tour de France stage, winning stage 16 of the race. The longest stage of the race, a route from Carcassonne to Bagnères-de-Luchon, Rogers attacked Cyril Gautier at the bottom of the descent of the Port de Balès with remaining to win in solo fashion.

===Post-cycling career===
After his active cycling career Rogers had been working as &#x27;s technical partner manager, and, prior to that, he had been the founder and CEO of virtual-world training platform VirtuGO, which closed down in November 2019. Since November 2020 Rogers is employed by the UCI as its &quot;innovation manager&quot;.

<text>Hazlemere is a village and civil parish in Buckinghamshire, England, northeast of High Wycombe on the A404 leading to Amersham, which intersects with the B474 at Hazlemere. To the north of the village is the hamlet of Holmer Green, which is in the civil parish of Little Missenden.

==History==
Hazlemere was a small hamlet in the ancient Desborough Hundred, and the name is recorded as long ago as the 13th century. The crossroads at the centre of the village was originally the meeting point of three different parishes, Penn, Hughenden, and Chepping Wycombe. The ecclesiastical parish of Hazlemere was formed in 1847 when the population was recorded as 766.

At the beginning of the 20th century, farming was still the primary industry in the area and in Edwardian times a large proportion of the area was devoted to cherry orchards. Brickmaking was carried out at the Old Kiln and at Oakengrove. By the 1930s, the area was losing its rural character, and indiscriminate building was increasing, stopped only by the outbreak of the Second World War, when a prisoner of war camp was constructed in the grounds of Hazlemere Park. After the war, the camp was used as temporary accommodation for refugees from the war in Europe. The camp was closed in 1956.

The 1960s and 1970s saw an increase in housing. Huge developments took place on the Park, and Brackley, Hill, and Manor Farms. No provision was made for leisure, and it was not until 1976 with the efforts of the Residents&#x27; and the Community Associations that Hazlemere got its own library and Community Centre. In 1987, Hazlemere became a parish.

==Notable residents==
* James Corden, actor, comedian, television personality, television presenter
* Sir Geoffrey de Havilland, aviator and aircraft designer, whose father had been the curate at Holy Trinity church
* Sir William Ramsay, Nobel prize-winning chemist (lived in Hazlemere until his death in 1916)
* Leigh-Anne Pinnock, Little Mix Singer
* Stevyn Colgan, Author and QI &#x27;elf&#x27;

==Schools and nurseries==
Schools in the village include Hazlemere Church of England School (opened in 1847), Cedar Park School to the north, with Manor Farm Community Junior School and Sir William Ramsay School to the south.

* Little Roo&#x27;s Day Nursey
* Little Cherubs Day Nursery
* Manor Farm Pre-School
* Come &amp; Play Pre-School
*The House That Jack Built Nursery
* Manor Farm Community Infant School
* Manor Farm Community Junior School
* Cedar Park School
* Hazlemere Church of England School (incorporating Hazlemere C of E Nursery)
* Sir William Ramsay Secondary School

==Politics and public administration==
As of August 2020, Hazlemere has two electoral wards. However, the new Buckinghamshire Council does not use the existing ward boundaries, and instead has a single unitary ward for Hazlemere; this ward elects five councillors in total. Hazlemere North and Hazlemere South are part of the Wycombe Parliamentary constituency.

Prior to the creation of a single unitary authority in April 2020, Hazlemere&#x27;s two electoral wards each elected two councillors to Wycombe District Council, and a single councillor to Buckinghamshire County Council.

Hazlemere has had its own parish council since 1987, with 12 parish councillors – six for each electoral ward.

<text>Hitcham was a village in Buckinghamshire, England. Today it is indistinguishable from the extended village of Burnham and is no longer marked on Ordnance Survey 1:50000 maps as a separate settlement. It is to the west of Burnham, close to the village of Taplow, and adjacent to the common on which Burnham Beeches stands.

The village name &#x27;Hitcham&#x27; is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means &#x27;Hycga&#x27;s homestead&#x27;. In the Domesday Book of 1086 the village was recorded as &quot;Hucheham&quot;.

In 1931 the parish had a population of 886. The civil parish of Hitcham was abolished on 1 April 1934 under a County Review Order, with the urban part going to Burnham parish, a larger but less populous part going to Taplow, and a tiny sliver going to Dorney.

The road Hitcham Lane still exists, and features Hitcham House, a large Manor House, now subdivided into several private residential properties.

<doc id="413017" wikidata="Q10858057" url="?curid=413017" title="Majlis">
<text> (, pl. &quot;&quot;) is an Arabic term meaning &#x27;sitting room&#x27;, used to describe various types of special gatherings among common interest groups of administrative, social or religious nature in countries with linguistic or cultural connections to the Muslim world. can refer to a legislature as well and is used in the name of legislative councils or assemblies in some states.

==Etymology==
&quot;Majlis&quot; is the Arabic word for a sitting room. Its Semitic root is the verb &quot;jalas&quot; meaning &#x27;to sit&#x27;, (cf. British English &#x27;sitting room&#x27; and &#x27;seat of government&#x27;).

It is also romanized as Mejlis or Majles. 

==History==
In pre-Islamic Arabia, a was a tribal council in which the male members participated in making decisions of common interest. The council was presided over by the chief (Sheikh). During the period of the Rashidun Caliphate, the Majlis al-Shura was formed to elect a new caliph. Al-Mawardi has written that members of the majlis should satisfy three conditions: they must be just, they must have enough knowledge to distinguish a good caliph from a bad one, and must have sufficient wisdom and judgement to select the best caliph.

==Residential==
Majlis is also used to refer to a private place where guests are received and entertained. Frequently the room has cushions placed around the walls where the visitors sit, either with the cushions placed directly on the floor or upon a raised shelf. Because hospitality is taken seriously, many families take pride in making their guests comfortable when visiting.

In many Arab homes, the majlis is the meeting room or front parlor used to entertain visitors. In Saudi Arabia, the decoration of the majlis in the home is often the responsibility of the women of the house, who either decorate the area themselves or barter with other women to do it for them. In Asir Province and in the neighboring Saada Governorate of Yemen, geometric designs and bright colors are used in al-Qatt Al-Asiri, a style of painting the majlis. 

Sometimes public waiting rooms are also called a majlis, since this is an area where people meet and visit. Here the traditional al-qatt al-Asiri has been added to the interior design of the room. The provincial airport in Abha has recently been designed to reflect the cultural heritage of the region, an airport official said: &quot;Abha is the first city in the Kingdom to have its airport decorated in a local-heritage style,&quot; said Provincial Airport Director Abdul Aziz Abu Harba. &quot;The seating arrangement at the airport lounge has been in the form of a traditional majlis and the walls are painted in various colors reflecting the natural beauty of Asir.&quot;

In the Najd of Saudi Arabia, wall coverings include star shapes and other geometric designs carved into the wall covering itself. Courtyards and upper pillared porticoes are principal features of the best Nadjdi architecture, in addition to the fine incised plaster wood called &quot;jis&quot; and painted window shutters that decorate the reception rooms. Good examples of plasterwork can often be seen in the gaping ruins of torn-down buildings- the effect is light, delicate and airy. It is usually around the majlis, around the coffee hearth and along the walls above where guests sat on rugs, against cushions. Doughty wondered if this &quot;parquetting of jis&quot;, this &quot;gypsum fretwork... all adorning and unenclosed&quot; originated from India. However, Najdi fretwork seems very different from that seen in the Eastern Province and in Oman, which are linked to Indian traditions, and resembles instead the motifs and patterns found in ancient Mesopotamia. The rosette, the star, the triangle and the stepped pinnacle pattern of dadoes are all ancient patterns and were found all over the Middle East in antiquity. Al-Qassim Region seems to be the home of this art, and there it is normally worked in hard white plaster, although what you see is usually begrimed by the smoke of the coffee hearth. In Riyadh, examples can be seen in unadorned clay.

<text>Robert Linlithgow Livingston Jr. (born April 30, 1943) is an American lobbyist and politician who served as a U.S. Representative from Louisiana from 1977 to 1999. A Republican, he was chosen as Newt Gingrich&#x27;s successor as Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, a position he declined following revelations of an extramarital affair. He served as a U.S. Representative from Louisiana from 1977 to 1999 and as the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee from 1995 to 1999. During his final years in Congress, Livingston was a strong supporter of Bill Clinton&#x27;s impeachment. He is currently a Washington, D.C.–based lobbyist. Livingston&#x27;s memoir, &quot;The Windmill Chaser: Triumphs and Less in American Politics&quot;, was published in September 2018.

==Family==
Livingston was born in Colorado Springs, Colorado. He is a descendant of the Livingston family of New York, whose members include Philip, a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence; Chancellor Robert R. Livingston, a co-author of the Declaration and author of the Louisiana Purchase; his younger brother, Edward, Aide de Camp and later Secretary of State to President Andrew Jackson, and who had earlier in his career held the same Congressional seat (La-1) as Bob Livingston. Livingston is a direct descendant of Henry Livingston, who was probably the (then anonymous) author of the poem, &quot;The Night Before Christmas&quot;,and French Admiral François Joseph Paul de Grasse, who together with General George Washington cornered and defeated British General Cornwallis in the Siege of Yorktown, Virginia, thereby concluding the American Revolutionary War. De Grasse&#x27;s daughter, Sylvie, married Henry Walter Livingston, ancestors of the Congressman.

Livingston was married in 1965 to the former Bonnie Robichaux (also born 1943), a native of Raceland in Lafourche Parish. Bonnie&#x27;s grandfather, Alcide Robichaux, served in the Louisiana State Senate, and her uncle, Philip Robichaux, was Lafourche Parish coroner for decades. Livingston&#x27;s father, a Roman Catholic, and his mother, an Episcopalian, were divorced when Livingston and his sister were quite young. Raised first as Roman Catholic and later as an Episcopalian, he returned to his wife&#x27;s religion, Roman Catholicism, in later years. The Livingstons have three biological sons, Robert, Richard and David, and an adopted daughter, SuShan a/k/a Susie. They have nine grandchildren. In July 2006, their son Richard died after being electrocuted by a live wire while trimming a tree damaged by Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.

==Early career==
As an undergraduate at Tulane University,
he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. Graduating from Tulane University Law School in 1968, Livingston joined the law practice of David C. Treen, who would become Louisiana&#x27;s first Republican congressman and governor since Reconstruction. Treen had been an active Republican in the days when the party barely existed in Louisiana, and this connection allowed Livingston to make valuable contacts in GOP circles. He was a delegate to all Republican conventions between 1976 and 2000. Between 1970 and 1976, Livingston worked for U.S. Attorney for the Louisiana&#x27;s Eastern District Gerald J. Gallinghouse, Orleans Parish District Attorney Harry Connick Sr., and Louisiana State Attorney General, William J. &quot;Billy&quot; Guste Jr.

==US Representative==

Livingston resigned his position as head of the state attorney general&#x27;s organized crime unit in 1976 when he won the Republican nomination for Louisiana&#x27;s 1st Congressional District, encompassing roughly half of New Orleans and many of its surrounding suburbs. The seat, which had been trending Republican for some time at the national level, had opened up when 36-year incumbent Democrat and former House Armed Services Committee chairman F. Edward Hébert retired. Livingston narrowly lost to one-term state legislator Richard Tonry of Chalmette in St. Bernard Parish. Livingston was denied victory when a third-party candidate, former Sixth District Congressman John Rarick, formerly of St. Francisville in West Feliciana Parish, filed as an independent in the last days of the race. Rarick, who had been one of the most conservative Democrats in Congress during his tenure, siphoned off roughly 9% of the votes cast, enabling Tonry to win with a plurality.

Allegations, however, surfaced of &quot;tombstone&quot; votes for Tonry in both the primary and general election. Tonry was forced to resign in May 1977 and run again in the special election for his seat. However, he lost the Democratic nomination in August to State Representative Ron Faucheux. While Faucheux may have been hindered by a split in the Democratic vote due to Sanford Krasnoff, who ran as an Independent challenger from the left, Livingston won the seat with a majority, 51%, of the votes cast (56,121 votes to Faucheux&#x27;s 40,862, and Krasnoff&#x27;s 12,665), becoming the first Republican to represent a significant portion of New Orleans in Congress since Reconstruction. Faucheux later lost an attempt to unseat New Orleans Mayor Dutch Morial in 1982, and was named Secretary of Commerce by Governor Edwin Washington Edwards in 1984.

Livingston was aided by a cadre of dedicated Republican volunteers, including the newly installed National Committeewoman Virginia Martinez of Kenner. In 1978, Livingston won a full term with 86 percent of the vote. He was reelected eleven times, dropping below 80 percent of the vote only once, in 1992. He was completely unopposed in 1986, 1996 and 1998. His district became even more Republican after the 1980 census, when most of the district&#x27;s share of New Orleans was shifted to the 2nd District. It was replaced with some heavily Republican territory in Jefferson Parish. After the 1990 census, Livingston&#x27;s district gained conservative Washington and Tangipahoa parishes from the 6th district while relinquishing equally conservative Saint Bernard and Plaquemines to the 3rd district.

Although well known in Louisiana, Livingston was a relatively low-key congressman for his first eighteen years in Washington. However, early in his career, he landed a spot on the powerful Appropriations Committee. This, together with his conservative stances on most issues, made him popular with his constituents, most of whom had never been previously represented by a Republican.

===Chairman, House Appropriations Committee===
Livingston first came to national attention in 1995, when he was named chairman of the Appropriations Committee after the Republican takeover of the House. This instantly made him one of the most powerful members of Congress. During one committee session, he brandished an alligator skinning knife, a Bowie knife, and a machete to demonstrate his seriousness as a budget-cutter.

During the Monica Lewinsky scandals, Livingston was one of many Republicans who demanded President Bill Clinton&#x27;s resignation, and later impeachment, for perjury. After Newt Gingrich announced that he would resign as Speaker (in part because of Republican losses in the 1998 elections, and in part because of revelations of an extramarital affair with a congressional employee 23 years his junior), majority leader Dick Armey and majority whip Tom DeLay had opted not to contest the Speaker&#x27;s chair. Livingston subsequently announced that he was not only running for Speaker, but had lined up enough support to win. He was nominated as the Republican candidate for Speaker without opposition, and as the GOP had retained a narrow majority in the House, this effectively made him Speaker-elect. Although the Speaker is formally elected by the entire House, in practice the majority party&#x27;s candidate is all but assured of winning that vote.

===Resignation===
In 1998, &quot;Hustler Magazine&quot; publisher Larry Flynt offered up to $1 million for anyone providing tips about unflattering sexual stories regarding members of Congress or high government officials. Livingston learned late on the night of December 15, 1998—just days before the full House of Representatives was about to begin debating the impeachment of President Clinton—that Flynt had been in contact with at least one woman with whom he had had an extramarital affair. Two days later, December 17, 1998, in a closed-door evening conference of his House Republican colleagues, Livingston said, &quot;I very much regret having to tell you that I&#x27;ve been Flynted!&quot; The same day, Flynt released a press release saying he was investigating tips about four alleged affairs Livingston had had. Two days later, on December 19, 1998, during the final impeachment debates in the House of Representatives, Livingston reiterated his call for Clinton to resign. Saying that he could only make this call &quot;if I am willing to heed my own words,&quot; he announced that he would not only stand down as Republican candidate for Speaker, but would leave the House as well. He announced that he would resign his House seat &quot;approximately six months into the 106th Congress.&quot; (Privately, Livingston told colleagues that had he sought the speakership, it would have been more difficult for the House Republicans to carry out their agenda.) In a subsequent speech, hurriedly written after consultation with the White House, Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri proclaimed &quot;We need to stop destroying imperfect people at the altar of an unobtainable morality&quot;, and praised Livingston and encouraged members to applaud him, which they did, giving the Louisianan standing ovations. Gephardt had previously urged Livingston to reconsider his resignation, having pledged not to make an issue of the extramarital affair if he became Speaker.

Following Livingston&#x27;s announcement of his resignation, House Republicans settled on Chief Deputy Whip Dennis Hastert (who, unbeknownst to the public or his colleagues, was a child molester) to succeed Gingrich as Speaker of the House—a decision Livingston would later describe, in memoirs published in 2018, as &quot;a disaster.&quot; Years later, Livingston recalled giving Hastert &quot;a foot-thick binder&quot; filled with notes intended to help him become a successful Speaker, &quot;and if he read any part of the thing, I&#x27;d be surprised.&quot;

Livingston resigned from the House on March 1, 1999, two months into his 13th term.

==Gubernatorial race==

In 1985, Livingston had called for the resignation of Governor Edwin Edwards, who faced indictment and trial on charges of racketeering and fraud. &quot;He shouldn&#x27;t continue to drag the image of our state down with his legal problems,&quot; Livingston said of Edwards.

In 1987, Livingston ran for governor himself and declared, &quot;You can lay our problems at the hands of politicians.&quot; He questioned the state&#x27;s poor performance regarding school drop-outs, unemployment, and credit rating. He even noted that Louisiana had a high number of cancer patients, a factor that was often attributed to environmental hazards. Livingston continued:

I&#x27;m prepared to clean house... The rest of the nation has the impression that Louisiana doesn&#x27;t want to work... that Louisiana will tolerate corruption... that Louisiana is not serious about improving its quality of life...

Despite polls that had generally showed that Livingston would face the incumbent governor, Edwin Edwards, in a second round of balloting, Livingston finished third of the nine candidates. Because of a last-week surge to his fellow U.S. representative, Buddy Roemer of Louisiana&#x27;s 4th congressional district, Livingston fell ten points short of a runoff berth. Roemer was slated into a runoff election officially the Louisiana general election. Two other major candidates finished behind Livingston: the Democratic (later Republican) representative Billy Tauzin of Louisiana&#x27;s 3rd congressional district and the outgoing Secretary of State James H. &quot;Jim&quot; Brown.

Despite his showing in the gubernatorial race, Livingston remained popular in his district and went on to win easy re-elections as he moved up the leadership ladder in the House.

==Lobbyist==
Since resigning from Congress, Livingston has worked as a lobbyist.

===Livingston Group===
Soon after retiring from public life he founded The Livingston Group, a lobbying group in Washington, D.C. Some of their noted accomplishments include Congressional approval of a Morocco–United States Free Trade Agreement and Congressional normalization of relations between the US and Libya following the Libyan abdication of nuclear technology and settlement of claims by family members for people killed in Pan Am Flight 103 and other violent incidents in the 1980s.

====Clients====
The Livingston Group&#x27;s clients have included Citigroup, the United States Chamber of Commerce, and Verizon Communications. Another important client was the Republic of Turkey, on whose behalf the Group lobbied until March 2008. Critics contend that this lobbying was a form of genocide denial, as Turkey does not recognize the slaughter of up to approximately a million million Armenians as a genocide, and does not want the American Government to recognize these events as genocide either.

The Livingston Group has also represented the government of Egypt until March 2012. Acting as lobbyist for Egypt Livingston &quot;helped stall a Senate bill that called on Egypt to curtail human rights abuses&quot; in 2010. His stated role is to enhance relations between the United States and the Republic of Egypt, which he perceives as critical to a resolution of tension in the Middle East.

===Trump–Ukraine scandal===

Livingston emerged as a &quot;behind-the-scenes player&quot; in the impeachment inquiry against President Trump, apparently having urged a Trump administration official to oust the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. On October 30, 2019, U.S. State Department employee Catherine Croft noted in her opening statement to the congressional committees conducting the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump:

During my time at the NSC, I received multiple calls from lobbyist Robert Livingston, who told me that Ambassador Yovanovitch should be fired. He characterized Ambassador Yovanovitch as an &quot;Obama holdover&quot; and associated with George Soros. It was not clear to me at that time-or now-at whose direction or at what expense Mr. Livingston was seeking the removal of Ambassador Yovanovitch.

==Other activities==
Livingston declared his support for Donald Trump in March 2016, comparing him to Ronald Reagan.

In 2003, Livingston was inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield.

Livingston testified in the 2009 trial of Mose Jefferson, who was convicted on four counts related to bribery. In response to a comparison made by James Gill between Livingston and former U.S. representative William J. Jefferson (convicted of 11 felonies), Livingston defended the Livingston Group as having no relation to Jefferson&#x27;s activities, but rather to the extent that they may have represented the same client, performed their own services in an entirely legal manner.

From 2011 to 2014, Livingston became Treasurer of the Louisiana Republican Party. Livingston said taking the fundraising assignment for the Louisiana GOP would not in any way undermine the work of The Livingston Group.

Livingston is also a member of the board of the International Foundation for Electoral Systems, a non-profit involved in international elections, and he is a Knight of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta.

<text>Islandshire was an area of Northumberland, England, comprising Lindisfarne or Holy Island, plus five parishes on the mainland.

It is historically associated with the Bishop of Durham, and was administratively an exclave of the County Palatinate of Durham. It was transferred to the county of Northumberland by the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844, becoming a hundred.

It formed part of the Norham and Islandshires Rural District from 1894 until 1974, and then formed part of the borough of Berwick-upon-Tweed district within the County of Northumberland. In 2009 the borough of Berwick-upon-Tweed was abolished as part of wider structural changes to local government in England, with the area now falling under the unitary council of Northumberland County Council. The area, combined with Norham, still forms one of the unitary council&#x27;s electoral divisions today.

It consisted of the parishes of Ancroft, Belford, Elwick, Holy Island, Kyloe and Tweedmouth.

<text>Hoggeston is a village and civil parish within the Aylesbury Vale district in Buckinghamshire, England. It is located around south-east of Winslow, and around north of Aylesbury. It is in the civil parish of Dunton.

The village name is Anglo-Saxon in origin, and means &quot;Hogg&#x27;s farm&quot;. In the Domesday Book of 1086 it was recorded as &quot;Hochestone&quot;.

The village was once granted (in 1314) a Royal charter to hold a market once a week, though this has long since been discontinued.

The parish church (Church of the Holy Cross of Saint Cameron) is dedicated to the Holy Cross. The church, which appears all of one period from the exterior, has a 16th-century weatherboarded bell turret (containing 3 Change ringing Bells and a Sanctus bell) over the north aisle. The origins of the church are from the 13th century. There are 14th century additions, and some Perpendicular windows of the same era. The stained glass east window was designed by Sir Niniam Comper in 1949. Anciently there was a fair in the village every year on the feast day of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross (commonly called Holyrood Day). The wrought iron gate, made in the 1970s, to the church yard depicts a stag, the crest of the Micklem family, who resided at Maines Hill, a house just outside the confines of the village.

South of the church is Hoggeston Manor house. This Jacobean house is built of brick with a blue brick diapering pattern. The house is symmetrical and among its noticeable features are the giant brick pilasters, on the north and south facades. The interior has a remarkable Jacobean oak staircase with dumbbell-shaped balusters.

<text>A loading gauge is a diagram or physical structure that defines the maximum height and width dimensions in railway vehicles and their loads. Their purpose is to ensure that rail vehicles can pass safely through tunnels and under bridges, and keep clear of platforms, trackside buildings and structures. Classification systems vary between different countries, and loading gauges may vary across a network, even if the track gauge is uniform.

The term loading gauge can also be applied to the maximum size of road vehicles in relation to tunnels, overpasses and bridges, and doors into automobile repair shops, bus garages, filling stations, residential garages, multi-storey car parks and warehouses.

A related but separate gauge is the structure gauge, which sets limits to the extent that bridges, tunnels and other infrastructure can encroach on rail vehicles. The difference between these two gauges is called the clearance. The specified amount of clearance makes allowance for wobbling of rail vehicles at speed.

==Overview==

The loading gauge restricts the size of passenger coaches, goods wagons (freight cars) and shipping containers that can travel on a section of railway track. It varies across the world and often within a single railway system. Over time there has been a trend towards larger loading gauges and more standardization of gauges; some older lines have had their structure gauges enhanced by raising bridges, increasing the height and width of tunnels and making other necessary alterations. Containerisation and a trend towards larger shipping containers has led rail companies to increase structure gauges to compete effectively with road haulage.

The term &quot;loading gauge&quot; can also refer to a physical structure, sometimes using electronic detectors using light beams on an arm or gantry placed over the exit lines of goods yards or at the entry point to a restricted part of a network. The devices ensure that loads stacked on open or flat wagons stay within the height/shape limits of the line&#x27;s bridges and tunnels, and prevent out-of-gauge rolling stock entering a stretch of line with a smaller loading gauge. Compliance with a loading gauge can be checked with a clearance car. In the past, these were simple wooden frames or physical feelers mounted on rolling stock. More recently, laser beams are used.

The loading gauge is the maximum size of rolling stock. It is distinct from the minimum structure gauge, which sets limits to the size of bridges and tunnels on the line, allowing for engineering tolerances and the motion of rail vehicles. The difference between the two is called the clearance. The terms &quot;dynamic envelope&quot; or &quot;kinematic envelope&quot; – which include factors such as suspension travel, overhang on curves (at both ends and middle) and lateral motion on the track – are sometimes used in place of loading gauge.

The railway platform height is also a consideration for the loading gauge of passenger trains. Where the two are not directly compatible, stairs may be required, which will increase loading times. Where long carriages are used at a curved platform, there will be gaps between the platform and the carriage door, causing risk. Problems increase where trains of several different loading gauges and train floor heights use (or even must pass without stopping at) the same platform.

The size of load that can be carried on a railway of a particular gauge is also influenced by the design of the rolling stock. Low-deck rolling stock can sometimes be used to carry taller shipping containers on lower gauge lines although their low-deck rolling stock cannot then carry as many containers.

Rapid transit (metro) railways generally have a very small loading gauge, which reduces the cost of tunnel construction. These systems only use their own specialised rolling stock.

=== Out of gauge ===
Larger &quot;out-of-gauge&quot; loads can also sometimes be conveyed by taking one or more of the following measures:
* Operate at low speed, especially in places with limited clearance, such as platforms.
* Cross over from a track with inadequate clearance to another track with greater clearance, even if there is no signalling to allow this.
* Prevent operation of other trains on adjacent tracks.
* Use refuge loops to allow trains to operate on other tracks.
* Use of Schnabel cars (special rolling stock) that manipulate the load up and down or left and right to clear obstacles.
* Remove (and later replace) obstacles.
* Use gauntlet track to shift the train to side or center.
* For locomotives that are too heavy, ensure that fuel tanks are nearly empty.
* Turn off power in overhead wiring or in the third rail (use diesel locomotive)
* Permanently adapt a certain route to larger gauge if there is repeated need for such trains.

==History==
The loading gauge on the main lines of Great Britain, most of which were built before 1900, is generally smaller than in other countries. In mainland Europe, the slightly larger Berne gauge (Gabarit passe-partout international, PPI) was agreed to in 1913 and came into force in 1914. As a result, British trains have noticeably and considerably smaller loading gauges and, for passenger trains, smaller interiors, despite the track being standard gauge, which is in line with much of the world.

This often results in increased costs for purchasing new trainsets or locomotives as they must be specifically designed for the existing British network, rather than being purchased &quot;off-the-shelf&quot;. For example, the new trains for HS2 have a 50% premium applied to the &quot;classic compatible&quot; sets that will be &quot;compatible&quot; with the current (or &quot;classic&quot;) rail network loading gauge as well as the HS2 line. The &quot;classic compatible&quot; trainsets will cost £40million per trainset whereas the HS2-only stock (built to European loading gauge and only suitable to operate on HS2 lines) will cost £27M per trainset despite the HS2-only stock being physically larger.

It was recognized even during the nineteenth century that this would pose problems and countries whose railroads had been built or upgraded to a more generous loading gauge pressed for neighboring countries to upgrade their own standards. This was particularly true in continental Europe where the Nordic countries and Germany with their relatively generous loading gauge wanted their cars and locomotives to be able to run throughout the standard gauge network without being limited to a small size. France, which at the time had the most restrictive loading gauge ultimately compromised giving rise to Berne gauge which came into effect just before World War I.

Military railways were often built to particularly high standards, especially after the American Civil War and the Franco-Prussian War showed the importance of railroads in military deployment as well as mobilization. The Kaiserreich was particularly active in the construction of military railways which were often built with great expense to be as flat, straight and permissive in loading gauge as possible while bypassing major urban areas, making those lines of little use to civilian traffic, particularly civilian passenger traffic. However, all those aforementioned factors have in some cases led to the subsequent abandoning of those railroads.

==Standard loading gauges for standard track gauge lines==

===International Union of Railways (UIC) Gauge===

The International Union of Railways (UIC) has developed a standard series of loading gauges named A, B, B+ and C.
* PPI – the predecessor of the UIC gauges had the maximum dimensions with an almost round roof top.
* UIC A: The smallest (slightly larger than PPI gauge). Maximum dimensions .
* UIC B: Sligtly larger than the UIC on the roff level. Maximum dimensions .

In Germany and other central European countries, the railway systems are built to UIC C gauges, sometimes with an increment in the width, allowing Scandinavian trains to reach German stations directly, originally built for Soviet freight cars. Maximum dimensions .
===Europe===

====European standards====

In the European Union, the UIC directives were supplanted by ERA Technical Specifications for Interoperability (TSI) of European Union in 2002, which has defined a number of recommendations to harmonize the train systems. The TSI Rolling Stock (2002/735/EC) has taken over the UIC Gauges definitions defining Kinematic Gauges with a reference profile such that Gauges GA and GB have a height of (they differ in shape) with Gauge GC rising to allowing for a width of of the flat roof. All cars must fall within an envelope of wide on a radius curve. The TGVs, which are wide, fall within this limit.

The designation of a GB+ loading gauge refers to the plan to create a pan-European freight network for ISO containers and trailers with loaded ISO containers. These container trains (&quot;piggy-back trains&quot;) fit into the B envelope with a flat top so that only minor changes are required for the widespread structures built to loading gauge B on continental Europe. A few structures on the British Isles were extended to fit with GB+ as well, where the first lines to be rebuilt start at the Channel Tunnel.

Owing to their historical legacies, many member states&#x27; railways do not conform to the TSI specification. For example, Britain&#x27;s role at the forefront of railway development in the 19th century has condemned it to the small infrastructure dimensions of that era. Conversely, the s of countries that were satellites of the former Soviet Union are much larger than the TSI specification. Other than for GB+, they are not likely to be retrofitted, given the enormous cost and disruption that would be entailed.

====Double-decker carriages====
A specific example of the value of these loading gauges is that they permit double decker passenger carriages. Although mainly used for suburban commuter lines, France is notable for using them on its high speed TGV services: the SNCF TGV Duplex carriages are high, the Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland feature large numbers of double decker intercity trains as well. In Germany the Bombardier Twindexx was introduced in InterCity service in December 2015.

====Great Britain====
Great Britain has (in general) the most restrictive loading gauge (relative to track gauge) in the world. That is a legacy of the British railway network being the world&#x27;s oldest, and of having been built by a large number of different private companies, each with different standards for the width and height of trains. After nationalisation, a standard static gauge W5 was defined in 1951 that would virtually fit everywhere in the network. The W6 gauge is a refinement of W5, and the W6a changed the lower body to accommodate third-rail electrification. While the upper body is rounded for W6a with a static curve, there is an additional small rectangular notch for W7 to accommodate the transport of ISO containers, and the W8 loading gauge has an even larger notch spanning outside of the curve to accommodate the transport of ISO containers. While W5 to W9 are based on a rounded roof structure, those for W10 to W12 define a flat line at the top and, instead of a strict static gauge for the wagons, their sizes are derived from dynamic gauge computations for rectangular freight containers.

Network Rail uses a &quot;W&quot; loading gauge classification system of freight transport ranging from W6A (smallest) through W7, W8, W9, W9Plus, W10, W11 to W12 (largest). The definitions assume a common &quot;lower sector structure gauge&quot; with a common freight platform at above rail.

In addition, gauge C1 provides a specification for standard coach stock, gauge C3 for longer Mark 3 coaching stock, gauge C4 for Pendolino stock and gauge UK1 for high-speed rail. There is also a gauge for locomotives. The size of container that can be conveyed depends both upon the size of the load that can be conveyed and the design of the rolling stock.

* W6A: Available over the majority of the British rail network.
* W8: Allows standard high shipping containers to be carried on standard wagons.
* W9: Allows high &quot;Hi-Cube&quot; shipping containers to be carried on &quot;Megafret&quot; wagons that have lower deck height with reduced capacity. At wide, it allows for wide &quot;Euro&quot; shipping containers, which are designed to carry Euro-pallets efficiently
* W10: Allows high &quot;Hi-Cube&quot; shipping containers to be carried on standard wagons and also allows wide &quot;Euro&quot; shipping containers. Larger than UIC A.
* W11: Little used but larger than UIC B.
* W12: Slightly wider than W10 at to accommodate refrigerated containers. Recommended clearance for new structures, such as bridges and tunnels.
* UIC GC: Channel Tunnel and Channel Tunnel Rail Link to London; with proposals to upgrade the Midland Main Line northwards from London to GB+ standards.

A strategy was adopted in 2004 to guide enhancements of loading gauges and in 2007 the freight route utilisation strategy was published. That identified a number of key routes where the loading gauge should be cleared to W10 standard and, where structures are being renewed, that W12 is the preferred standard.

=====Tube lines=====
* City and South London Railway was built with tunnels of only diameter. Enlarged for Northern line to 
* Central line with tunnels of , increased on curves, reduced to near to stations. This makes Central line trains unique on the London Underground system because, although the loading gauge of the rolling stock is the same as the other &#x27;tube&#x27; lines, the smaller size of the tunnel requires that the positive conductor rail is higher than on all other lines.

A Parliamentary committee headed by James Stansfeld then reported on 23 May 1892, &quot;The evidence submitted to the Committee on the question of the diameter of the underground tubes containing the railways has been distinctly in favour of a minimum diameter of &quot;. After that, all tube lines were at least that size.

* Piccadilly line with tunnels of 
* Victoria line with tunnels of ; enlarged to reduce air friction.
* Glasgow Subway with tunnels of and a unique track gauge of only .
* Tyne and Wear Metro with tunnels of ; built to mainline rail network standards.

====Sweden====
Sweden uses shapes similar to the Central European loading gauge, but trains are allowed to be much wider.

There are three main classes in use (width × height):
* Class SE-A is . Similar to OPS-NL (Netherlands), Victorian (Australia) and Chinese loading gauges.
* Class SE-B is . Similar to Norwegian loading gauge.
* Class SE-C is with a completely flat roof top. Similar to OPS-GC (Netherlands) loading gauge.

The Iron Ore Line north of Kiruna was the first electrified railway line in Sweden and has limited height clearance (SE-B) because of snow shelters. On the rest of the network belonging to the Swedish Transport Administration (&quot;Trafikverket&quot;), the structure gauge accepts cars built to SE-A and thus accepts both cars built to UIC GA and GB. Some modern electric multiple units, like Regina X50 with derivatives, are somewhat wider than normally permitted by SE-A at . This is generally acceptable as the extra width is above normal platform height, but it means that they can not use the high platforms that Arlanda Express uses (Arlanda Central Station has normal clearances). The greater width allows sleeping cars in which tall people can sleep with straight legs and feet, which is not the case on the continent.

====Netherlands====
In the Netherlands, a similar shape to the UIC C is used that rises to in height. The trains are wider allowing for width similar to Sweden. About one third of the Dutch passenger trains use bilevel rail cars. However, Dutch platforms are much higher than Swedish ones.

===== Betuweroute =====
* Betuweroute: to allow double stacked container trains in the future. The present overhead line does not allow this height, as it has to follow standards.

===North America===

====Freight====

The American loading gauge for freight cars on the North American rail network is generally based on standards set by the Association of American Railroads (AAR) Mechanical Division. The most widespread standards are AAR Plate B and AAR Plate C, but higher loading gauges have been introduced on major routes outside urban centers to accommodate rolling stock that makes better economic use of the network, such as auto carriers, hi-cube boxcars, and double-stack container loads. The maximum width of on (AAR Plate B), (AAR Plate C) and all other truck centers (of all other AAR Plates) are on a radius or 13° curve. In all cases of the increase of truck centers, the decrease of width is covered by AAR Plates D1 and D2.

Listed here are the maximum heights and widths for cars. However, the specification in each AAR plate shows a car cross section that is chamfered at the top and bottom, meaning that a compliant car is not permitted to fill an entire rectangle of the maximum height and width.

Technically, AAR Plate B is still the maximum height and truck center combination and the circulation of AAR Plate C is somewhat restricted. The prevalence of excess-height rolling stock, at first ~ piggybacks and hicube boxcars, then later autoracks, airplane-parts cars, and flatcars for hauling Boeing 737 fuselages, as well as high double-stacked containers in container well cars, has been increasing. This means that most, if not all, lines are now designed for a higher loading gauge. The width of these extra-height cars is covered by AAR Plate D1.

All the Class I rail companies have invested in longterm projects to increase clearances to allow double stack freight. The mainline North American rail networks of the Union Pacific, the BNSF, the Canadian National, and the Canadian Pacific, have already been upgraded to AAR Plate K. This represents over 60% of the Class I rail network.

==== Passenger service ====
The old standard North American passenger railcar is wide by high and measures over coupler pulling faces with truck centers, or over coupler pulling faces with truck centers. In the 1940s and 1950s, the American passenger car loading gauge was increased to a height throughout most of the country outside the Northeast, to accommodate dome cars and later Superliners and other bilevel commuter trains. Bilevel and Hi-level passenger cars have been in use since the 1950s, and new passenger equipment with a height of has been built for use in Alaska and the Canadian Rockies. The structure gauge of the Mount Royal Tunnel used to limit the height of bilevel cars to before it was permanently closed to interchange rail traffic prior to its conversion for the REM rapid transit system.

==== New York City Subway ====
The New York City Subway is an amalgamation of three former constituent companies, and while all are standard gauge, inconsistencies in loading gauge prevent cars from the former BMT and IND systems (B Division) from running on the lines of the former IRT system (A Division), and vice versa. This is mainly because IRT tunnels and stations are approximately narrower than the others, meaning that IRT cars running on the BMT or IND lines would have platform gaps of over between the train and some platforms, whereas BMT and IND cars would not even fit into an IRT station without hitting the platform edge. Taking this into account, all maintenance vehicles are built to IRT loading gauge so that they can be operated over the entire network, and employees are responsible for minding the gap.

Another inconsistency is the maximum permissible railcar length. Cars in the former IRT system are . Railcars in the former BMT and IND can be longer: on the former Eastern Division, the cars are limited to , while on the rest of the BMT and IND lines plus the Staten Island Railway (which uses modified IND stock) the cars may be as long as .

====Boston (MBTA)====
The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority&#x27;s (MBTA) rapid transit system is composed of four unique subway lines; while all lines are standard gauge, inconsistencies in loading gauge, electrification, and platform height prevent trains on one line from being used on another. The first segment of the Green Line (known as the Tremont Street subway) was constructed in 1897 to take the streetcars off Boston&#x27;s busy downtown streets. When the Blue Line opened in 1904, it only ran streetcar services; the line was converted to rapid transit in 1924 due to high passenger loads, but the tight clearances in the tunnel under the Boston Harbor required narrower and shorter rapid transit cars. The Orange Line was originally built in 1901 to accommodate heavy rail transit cars of higher capacity than streetcars. The Red Line was opened in 1912, designed to handle what were for a time the largest underground transit cars in the world.

====Los Angeles (LACMTA)====
The Los Angeles Metro Rail system is an amalgamation of two former constituent companies, the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission and the Southern California Rapid Transit District; both of those companies were responsible for planning the initial system. It is composed of two heavy rail subway lines and several light rail lines with subway sections; while all lines are standard gauge, inconsistencies in electrification and loading gauge prohibit the light rail trains from operating on the heavy rail lines, and vice versa. The LACTC-planned Blue Line was opened in 1990 and partially operates on the route of the Pacific Electric interurban railroad line between downtown Los Angeles and Long Beach, which used overhead electrification and street-running streetcar vehicles. The SCRTD-planned Red Line (later split into the Red and Purple lines) was opened in 1993 and was designed to handle high-capacity heavy rail transit cars that would operate underground. Shortly after the Red Line began operations, the LACTC and the SCRTD merged to form the LACMTA, which became responsible for planning and construction of the Green, Gold, Expo, and K lines, as well as the D Line Extension and the Regional Connector.

=== Asia ===
Major trunk raillines in East Asian countries, including China, North Korea, South Korea, as well as the Shinkansen of Japan, have all adopted a loading gauge of maximum width and can accept the maximum height of .
==== China ====
The maximum height, width, and length of general Chinese rolling stock are , and respectively, with an extra &quot;out-of-gauge&quot; load allowance of height and width with some special shape limitation, corresponding to a structure gauge of . China is building numerous new railways in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia (such as in Kenya and Laos), and these are being built to &quot;Chinese Standards&quot;. This presumably means track gauge, loading gauge, structure gauge, couplings, brakes, electrification, etc. An exception may be double stacking, which has a height limit of . Metre gauge in China has a gauge of .

==== Japan, standard gauge ====

Translation of legend:
* Blue: Rural railway vehicle gauge (Rural Railway Construction Rules 1919) 
* Grey: Conventional Cape gauge (3 ft 6 in track gauge) railway vehicle limits (Ordinary Railway Structure Rules 1987) 
* Figures in () are previous Cape gauge rolling stock limits (Railway Construction Rules 1900)
* Green: Shinkansen vehicle limits 

Trains on the Shinkansen network operate on track and have a loading gauge of maximum width and maximum height. This allows the operation of double-deck high-speed trains.

&quot;Mini Shinkansen&quot; (former conventional narrow gauge lines that have been regauged into ) and some private railways in Japan (including some lines of the Tokyo subway and all of the Osaka Metro) also use standard gauge; however, their loading gauges are different.

The rest of Japan&#x27;s system is discussed under narrow gauge, below.
==== Hong Kong ====


==== South Korea ====
The body frame may have a maximum height of and a maximum width of with additional installations allowed up to . That width of 3,400 mm is only allowed above as the common passenger platforms are built to former standard trains of in width.

==== Philippines ====
There is currently no uniform standard for loading gauges in the country and both loading gauges and platform heights vary by rail line.

The North–South Commuter Railway allows passenger trains with a carbody width of and a height of . Additional installations shall also be allowed up to at a platform height of where it is limited by half-height platform screen doors. Above the platform gate height of above the platforms, out-of-gauge installations can be further maximized to the Asian standard at .

Meanwhile, the PNR South Long Haul will follow the Chinese gauge and therefore use a larger carbody width of from the specifications of passenger rolling stock, and a height of per P70-type boxcar specifications.

=== Africa ===
Some of the new railways being built in Africa allow for double-stacked containers, the height of which is about depending on the height of each container or plus the height of the deck of the flat wagon about totalling . This exceeds the China height standard for single stacked containers of . Additional height of about is needed for overhead wires for 25 kV AC electrification.

The permissible width of the new African standard gauge railways is .

=== Australia ===
The standard gauge lines of New South Wales Government Railways allowed for a width of until 1910, after a conference of the states created a new standard of , with corresponding increase in track centres. The narrow widths have mostly been eliminated, except, for example, at the mainline platforms at Gosford and some sidings. The longest carriages are .

The Commonwealth Railways adopted the national standard of when they were established in 1912, although no connection with New South Wales was made until 1970.

A T set of the late 1980s was wide. Track centres from Penrith to Mount Victoria and Gosford and Wyong have been gradually widened to suit. The D set intercity sets are however wide, so further, costly modification was required beyond Springwood, which was completed in 2020.

The Kwinana, Eastern and Eastern Goldfields lines in Western Australia were built with a loading gauge of wide and tall to allow for trailer on flatcar (TOFC) traffic when converted to dual gauge in the 1960s.

==Broad gauge==
=== Indian Gauge ===
* The smallest loading gauge for a gauge railway is the Delhi Metro, which is wide and tall.
* Indian Railways has a maximum passenger loading gauge of and a freight loading gauge of 3,250 mm, with development allowing a width of . 
* Sri Lanka Railways has a loading gauge of between and .

=== 5 ft and Russian gauge===
In Finland, rail cars can be up to wide with a permitted height from on the sides to in the centre. The track gauge is , differing from the Russian track gauge.

The Russian loading gauges are defined in standard GOST 9238 (ГОСТ 9238–83, ГОСТ 9238–2013) with the current 2013 standard named &quot;Габариты железнодорожного подвижного состава и приближения строений&quot; (construction of rolling stock clearance diagrams [official English title]). It was accepted by the Interstate Council for Standardization, Metrology and Certification to be valid in Russia, Belarus, Moldova, Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Armenia. Loading gauge is generally wider than Europe, but with many exception standards.

* T: standard loading gauge
** T: 5,300 mm height, 3,750 mm width
** Tc: 5,200 mm height, 3,750 mm width: for tank and dumper cars
** Tpr: 5,300 mm height, 3,500 mm width: extra &quot;out-of-gauge&quot; cargo load for main tracks
* 1-T: guaranteed loading gauge for all ex-USSR lines including old tunnels.
** 1-T: 5,300 mm height, 3,400 mm width
* VM: for international stock for 1435 mm lines, standards for different lines
** 0-VM: 4,650 mm height, 3,250 mm width
** 1-VM: 4,700 mm height, 3,400 mm width
** 02-VM: 4,650 mm height, 3,150 mm width
** 03-VM: 4,280 mm height, 3,150 mm width

The standard defines static envelopes for trains on the national network as T, Tc and Tpr. The static profile 1-T is the common standard on the complete 1520 mm rail network including the CIS and Baltic states. The structure clearance is given as S, Sp and S250. There is a tradition that structure clearance is much bigger than the common train sizes. For international traffic, the standard references the kinematic envelope for GC and defines a modified GCru for its high-speed trains. For other international traffic, there are 1-T, 1-VM, 0-VM, 02-VM and 03-VMst/03-VMk for the trains and 1-SM for the structure clearance.

The main static profile T allows for a maximum width of rising to a maximum height of . The profile Tc allows that width only at a height of , requiring a maximum of below , which matches with the standard for train platforms (with a height of ). The profile Tpr has the same lower frame requirement but reduces the maximum upper body width to . The more universal profile 1-T has the complete body at a maximum width of still rising to a height of . Exceptions shall be double-stacking, maximum height shall be or .

The structure gauge S requires buildings to be placed at minimum of from the track centreline. Bridges and tunnels must have a clearance of at least wide and high. The structure gauge Sp for passenger platforms allows only above (the common platform height) requiring a width of below that line. The exceptions shall be double-stacking, minimum overhead wiring height must be (for maximum vehicle height of ) or (for maximum vehicle height of ).

The main platform is defined to have a height of at a distance of from the center of the track to allow for trains with profile T. Low platforms at a height of may be placed at from the center of the track. A medium platform is a variant of the high platform but at a height of . The latter matches with the TSI height in Central Europe. In the earlier standard from 1983, the profile T would only be allowed to pass low platforms at while the standard high platform for cargo and passenger platforms would be placed no less than from the center of the track. That matches with the Tc, Tpr and the universal 1-T loading gauge.

=== Iberian gauge ===
In Spain, rail cars can be up to 3.44 m (11 ft 3.5 in) wide with a permitted height of 4.33 m (14 ft 2.5 in) and this loading gauge is called iberian loading gauge. It is the standard loading gauge for conventional (iberian gauge) railways in Spain.

In Portugal, there are three railway loading gauge standards for conventional (iberian gauge) railways: Gabarito PT b, Gabarito PT b+ and Gabarito PT c. Gabarito PT b (also called CPb) and Gabarito PT b+ (also called CPb+) allow rail cars to be 3.44 m (11 ft 3.5 in) wide with a permitted height of 4.5 m (14 ft 9 in), although CPb+ has a slightly larger profile area. Gabarito PT c allows rail cars to be 3.44 m (11 ft 3.5 in) wide with a permitted height of 4.7 m (15 ft 5 in). Gabarito PT b and PT b+ are both used, being PT b+ more common overall. Gabarito PT c is currently not used. In Lisbon, there is a suburban railway line, the Cascais Line, that follows a fourth non-standard loading gauge.

=== Irish Gauge ===
==== Ireland and Northern Ireland ====

==== Australia ====
==== Brazil ====
== Narrow gauge ==

Narrow gauge railways generally have a smaller loading gauge than standard gauge ones, and this is a major reason for cost savings rather than the railgauge itself. For example, the Lyn locomotive of the Lynton and Barnstaple Railway is wide. By comparison, several standard gauge 73 class locomotives of the NSWR, which are wide, have been converted for use on cane tramways, where there are no narrow bridges, tunnels or track centres to cause trouble. The 6E1 locomotive of the South African Railways are wide.

A large numbers of railways using the gauge used the same rolling stock plans, which were wide.

=== Japan, narrow gauge ===
Translation of legend: 
* Blue: Rural railway vehicle gauge (Rural Railway Construction Rules 1919) 
* Grey: Conventional Cape gauge (3ft 6in track gauge) railway vehicle limits (Ordinary Railway Structure Rules 1987) 
* Figures in () are previous Cape gauge rolling stock limits (Railway Construction Rules 1900)
* Green: Shinkansen vehicle limits 

The Japanese national network operated by Japan Railways Group employs narrow gauge . The maximum allowed width of the rolling stock is and maximum height is ; however, a number JR lines were constructed as private railways prior to nationalisation in the early 20th century, and feature loading gauges smaller than the standard. These include the Chūō Main Line west of Takao, the Minobu Line, and the Yosan Main Line west of Kan&#x27;onji ( height). Nevertheless, advances in pantograph technology have largely eliminated the need for separate rolling stock in these areas.

There are many private railway companies in Japan and the loading gauge is different for each company.
=== South Africa ===

The South African national network employs gauge. The maximum width of the rolling stock is and maximum height is , which is greater than the normal British loading gauge for standard gauge vehicles.

=== New Zealand ===

The railways use gauge. The maximum width of the rolling stock is and maximum height is .

=== Other ===
 gauge for the United Kingdom and Sierra Leone:
* Minimum radius: 
* Width: (see Everard Calthrop)
* Wagon length (freight): over headstocks
* Wagon length (passenger): over headstocks
* Tank engine length: over headstocks

== Structure gauge ==

The structure gauge, which refers to the dimensions of the lowest and narrowest bridges or tunnels of the track, complements the loading gauge, which specifies the tallest and widest allowable vehicle dimensions. There is a gap between the structure gauge and loading gauge, and some allowance needs to be made for the dynamic movement of vehicles (sway) to avoid mechanical interference causing equipment and structural damage.

== Out of gauge ==
While it may be true that trains of a particular loading gauge can travel freely over tracks of a matching structure gauge, in practice, problems can still occur. In an accident at Moston station, an old platform not normally used by freight trains was hit by a train that wasn&#x27;t within its intended W6a gauge because two container fastenings were hanging over the side. Analysis showed that the properly configured train would have passed safely even though the platform couldn&#x27;t handle the maximum design sway of W6a. Accepting reduced margins for old construction is normal practice if there have been no incidents but if the platform had met modern standards with greater safety margin the out of gauge train would have passed without incident.

Trains larger than the loading gauge, but not too large, can operate if the structure gauge is carefully measured, and the trip is subject to various special regulations.

The village name &#x27;Hogshaw&#x27; is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means &#x27;Hogg&#x27;s brook&#x27; (where &#x27;Hogg&#x27; is someone&#x27;s personal name). In the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086 it was recorded as &quot;Hoggsceaga&quot;. The village name &#x27;Fulbrook&#x27; is also Anglo Saxon, and means &#x27;foul brook&#x27;. In the Domesday Book it was recorded as &quot;Fulebroc&quot;.

Anciently the parish was in the possession of the Knights Templar and, when that order was abolished, the Knights Hospitaller. It began as the Hogshaw Nunnery and then became the Hogshaw Commandery in the 15th century. However, in the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1547, the parish was seized by the Crown. It was after this time that the villages become depopulated. It was in 1720 that the church was officially depopulated for financial reasons, and the remaining villagers forced to worship at East Claydon. The church was demolished shortly after.

All that remains of the two villages today is seven houses.

<text>On car-free days, people are encouraged to travel by means other than cars. Some cities, like Jakarta and Tehran, have weekly car-free days. Other such days are annual. World Car Free Day is celebrated on September 22. Organized events are held in some cities and countries.

The events, which vary by location, give motorists and commuters an idea of their locality with fewer cars. The concept dates from the 1970s but was popularised in the 1990s.

Currently Bogotá holds the world&#x27;s largest car-free weekday event covering the entire city. The first car-free day was held in February 2000 and became institutionalised through a public referendum.

== History and timeline ==
===Origins===
While projects along these lines had taken place from time to time on an &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis starting with the 1973 oil crisis, it was only in October 1994 that a structured call for such projects was issued in a keynote speech by Eric Britton at the International Ciudades Accessibles (Accessible Cities) Conference held in Toledo, Spain.

Within two years the first Days were organized in Reykjavík (Iceland), Bath (United Kingdom) and La Rochelle (France), and the informal World Car Free Days Consortium was organized in 1995 to support Car-Free Days worldwide. The first national campaign was inaugurated in Britain by the Environmental Transport Association in 1997, the French followed suit in 1998 as In town, without my car! and was established as a Europe-wide initiative by the European Commission in 2000. In the same year the Commission enlarged the program to a full European Mobility Week which now is the major focus of the Commission, with the Car-Free Day part of a greater &quot;new mobility&quot; whole.

In 1996, a Dutch action group, Pippi Autoloze Zondag, started a national campaign for car free days. Pippi organized monthly illegal street actions to take over the streets and stop the cars. After blocking the streets, there would be parties, picknicks, kids playing, rollerskate on the motorway, street painting and music artists playing. The police would break the party down and make arrests. Pippi went on to create a Dutch national group to fight for car free days. Pippi lobbied every single national parliament politician from the Netherlands and inspired Dutch national parties to adopt the concept of car free days in their agenda. Every major city government in the Netherlands received Pippi&#x27;s proposals to implement car free days, forcing them to debate the issue. After two years of actions, several cities in the Netherlands relented and started to implement car free days.

The Environmental Transport Association set the initial annual Car-Free Day on the first Tuesday in their Green Transport Week (around 17 June). In 2000 it was agreed to make it a self-standing day held on September 22, originally as a pan-European day organised under the auspices of the European Commission and later with international extensions—during which a large number of cities around the world are invited to close their centers to cars. Pedestrians, bicycles, public transit and other forms of sustainable transportation are encouraged on these days. People can reflect on what their city would look like with a lot fewer cars, and what might be needed to make this happen. Advocates claim that over 100 million people in 1,500 cities celebrate International Car-Free Day, though on days and in ways of their choice.

Also in 2000, car free days went global with a World Carfree Day program launched by Carbusters, now World Carfree Network, and in the same year the Earth Car Free Day collaborative program of the Earth Day Network and the World Car Free Days collaborative.

== Regional car-free days ==

* In town, without my car! is an EU campaign.
* Carfree days are also held in many U.S. cities, such as Portland, Oregon; and in Japan.
* British Columbia hosts several Car Free Days organized by local communities, including those in Car Free Day Vancouver, Car Free Day North Vancouver, and Car Free Day Victoria.
* Since 22 September 2007, Jakarta has made Car Free Day a regular event, holding it three times a year. However, since 2012, the Jakarta Car Free Day has become a weekly event; held every Sundays morning around Sudirman-Thamrin avenues.
* At Bangkok&#x27;s celebration of World Car-Free Day 2018, celebrated on 22 September, Bangkok&#x27;s Deputy Governor, Sakoltee Phattiyakul, who presided over the event, arrived in his official automobile, as did his entourage. He then mounted a bicycle for a ceremonial ride. Prior to the event, which encouraged not using cars, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration announced there would be extensive free automobile parking spaces available for participants who were to ride bicycles in the parade.
* Bogota has celebrated car free day since 24 February 2000. This is an initiative to preserve the environment and to reflect about the use of the public transportation system.
* China has an irregular event called No Car Day
* In the Philippines, several cities and private developments have car-free days, where roads are closed at specific hours on Sundays to encourage walking, exercise, and other recreational activities.

== Car Free Day Call ==
The 1994 Car Free Day Call set out a challenge for a city, neighborhood or group:

*To spend one carefully prepared day without cars.
*To study and observe closely what exactly goes on during that day.
*Then, to reflect publicly and collectively on the lessons of this experience and on what might be prudently and creatively done next to build on these.

The exercise considered car users to be &quot;addicts&quot; who need to be &quot;treated&quot; in some way. The organisers considered this to mean that motorists should have no choice but to be without cars, at least for a time. In this particular instance the proposed &quot;treatment&quot; was to find an answer to the following question in three main parts:

*Is it possible to get drivers out of their cars in one or more cities...
*In ways that will be tolerable in a pluralistic democracy...
*For at least long enough to demonstrate what needs to happen to make a car-less (or, more accurately, less-car) urban transport paradigm actually work?

==Impact==
According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the event &quot;promotes improvement of mass transit, cycling and walking, and the development of communities where jobs are closer to home and where shopping is within walking distance&quot;. Studies showed that for short trips in cities, one can reach more quickly using a bicycle rather than using a car.

==Related concepts==
While not an officially organized Car-Free Day, every year traffic in Israel stops (except for emergency vehicles) for more than 24 hours in observance of Yom Kippur. This encompasses all motorized vehicles, including cars and public transportation (buses, trains, taxis, airplanes etc.). Cycling enthusiasts of the Hiloni stream and other religions take advantage of this, and roads (except in religious neighborhoods) become de facto esplanade and cycleways. Air pollution in Israel that day, measured by nitrogen oxides, dropped by 99 percent.

Richmondshire was a local government district of North Yorkshire, England, from 1974 to 2023. It covered a large northern area of the Yorkshire Dales including Swaledale and Arkengarthdale, Wensleydale and Coverdale, with the prominent Scot&#x27;s Dyke and Scotch Corner along the centre. Teesdale lay to the north. With a total area of 1,319 km2, it was larger than seven of the English ceremonial counties (namely, in decreasing order of size, the West Midlands, Merseyside, Tyne &amp; Wear, Rutland, the Isle of Wight, Bristol, and the City of London).

== History ==
{{expert|United Kingdom|ex2=History|date=May 2023}}
{{Moresources|section|date=October 2022}}
{{See also|Honour of Richmond}}
The history of this district in antiquity is not well known, but archaeologists have found artefacts from the Neolithic Period (4000–2000 BC){{clarify|date=May 2023}}, the Bronze Age (2500–2000 BC), the Iron Age (700 BC–first century AD) and the Roman Period (43–400 AD) in the Richmond area.

The closest important Roman settlement was at Catterick in Rheged, and was thesite of the Battle of Catterick. 

At the terminus of Scandinavian York, there was a local bout of rebellion in Stainmore, which resulted in the death of Eric Bloodaxe. The Scandinavian settlement of this area was eastwards from the Irish Sea with names such as Gilpatrick in Middleham and Thorfinn in Bedale occurring at the time of the Domesday Book. At the time of the Norman Conquest it was the Fee of Gillingshire, held by Edwin, Earl of Mercia. Gillingshire It was made up of the Borough of Richmond and the five wapentakes of Gilling West, Gilling East, Hang West, Hang East and Hallikeld. 

After the Harrying of the North, the land became capital{{clarify|date=May 2023}} of the Duchy of Brittany&#x27;s Honour of Richmond (first as a barony, then an earldom and later a dukedom).

The Honour of Richmond was one of the three largest lordships created by William the Conqueror. King William granted it to his double-second-cousin, Alan the Red, the leader of the Bretons in England and a cousin of Hawise, Duchess of Brittany.

According to the Register of the Honour of Richmond, the official transfer of the lands of Earl Edwin (Richmondshire) occurred at the &quot;Siege of York&quot; in 1068 or early 1069. Edwin&#x27;s brother Morcar, Earl of Northumbria, lost his title to Robert Commines on 28 January 1069 and also lost lands to Count Alan following the brothers&#x27; participation in the northern rebellion of 1068. 

A charter of Count Alan Rufus&#x27;s dated before 1086 states that he obtained the honour with the help of Queen Matilda. Alan had many other English estates, and by the time of the compilation of the Domesday Book he was one of the richest and most powerful barons. He died in 1093 and was succeeded by two of his brothers in turn. The family held on to this estate until 1399. Work on Richmond Castle started in 1071 after the northern rebellions had died down.

The Honour of Richmond comprised 782 manors throughout England. The Yorkshire portion was a compact unit of 199 manors and 43 outlying properties situated near the main roads from Scotland into the Vale of York.

Richmondshire became an appanage of the English Royal Family during the reign of Edward III of England. In 1525 Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Richmond and Somerset (1519–1536) became Lord Warden of the Marches and Lord President of the Council of the North while living at Sheriff Hutton.

One of the most distinctive forenames of Richmondshire folk was Marmaduke.

== Ecclesiastical divisions ==

St. Paulinus baptised the locals in the River Swale and as a result, it was known as the &quot;Jordan of England&quot;. 

Richmondshire is an archdeaconry which historically consisted of present-day Richmondshire and the Barony of Kendal in Westmorland, Copeland in Cumberland and what is now Lancashire north of Ribblesdale, such as Amounderness and Lonsdale. 

After originally composing part of the Diocese of York, it was transferred to the Diocese of Chester, before moving into the Diocese of Ripon and Leeds and finally the Diocese of Leeds (known informally as the &#x27;Diocese of West Yorkshire and the Dales&#x27; for a period, although this term has now fallen out of use).{{cn|date=September 2022}}

== Modern history ==

The modern district was formed on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972. It was a merger of the municipal borough of Richmond with the Aysgarth Rural District, Leyburn Rural District, Reeth Rural District and Richmond Rural District along with part of the Croft Rural District, all in the North Riding of Yorkshire.

See Richmondshire District Council for details of the former political makeup.

In July 2021 the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government announced that in April 2023, the non-metropolitan county of North Yorkshire would be reorganised into a unitary authority. On 1 April 2023, Richmondshire District Council was abolished and its functions transferred to a new unitary authority named North Yorkshire.

=== Economy ===

The region is heavily agricultural but there are also many commercial enterprises, supported by four main business associations: Richmond Business and Tourism Association, Swaledale and Arkengarthdale Business Association,
Lower Wensleydale Business Network and Upper Wensleydale Business Association.
Tourism is an important part of the economy with some visitors attracted by the Yorkshire Dales. In 2014, roughly 3.62 million people visited the area; tourism provided some £225 million to the economy and supported 3,860 full time jobs. There are many hiking trails in the region as well as various attractions. Travellers using the Trip Advisor site particularly recommend Richmond Castle, Green Howards Museum, Georgian Theatre Royal, The Station, Millgate House Garden, Richmondshire Museum, Foxglove Covert Local Nature Reserve, Catterick Racecourse, The Friary Gardens War Memorial and Friary Tower and Gardens.

Important communities for visitors include Hawes in Wensleydale, the home of Wensleydale cheese, Leyburn, a market town with many amenities, the very quaint villages of Reeth, Wensley, West Burton and Muker, and Middleham with its castle and horse racing.

Catterick Garrison is also important to the economy, particularly around Richmond. It is the largest British Army garrison in the world with a population of around 13,000 and expected to continue growing.

<text>Holmer Green is a village in the civil parish of Little Missenden, in Buckinghamshire, England. It is next to Hazlemere, about south of Great Missenden.

==History==

Holmer Green is named after the manor of Holmer that covered a significant part of the parish of Little Missenden in the Middle Ages. The early history of the village is essentially one of people moving out of Little Missenden over the centuries and settling on a large area of heath (now vanished) known as Wycombe Heath or Holmer Heath. The &#x27;Holmer&#x27; part of the toponym was first recorded as &quot;Holeme&quot; in 1208 and is probably derived from Old English. It is commonly thought to derive from &#x27;mere in a hollow&#x27; which would refer to Holmer Pond. However, there are certain factors that do not support this theory and the &quot;-mer&quot; element may actually translate to an Old English word meaning &#x27;boundary&#x27;. The &#x27;Green&#x27; part of the name refers to a large and ancient Green, probably dating from the 13th century that used to exist here but was reduced to a size of only in 1854.
The site of the original medieval manor house of Holmer remains obscure, although local historians McLain-Smith and Riches have suggested its location at a moated site in nearby Colemans Wood where they have excavated medieval pottery.

The oldest houses are The Old Rookery, Hollands Farm and Penfold, all of which probably date from the early 16th century when the hamlet thrived due to sheep farming. The Grade II-listed, brick and flint, Holmer Ridings, now a manor and equestrian facility, was built ca. 1728 as a hunting lodge and has been fully restored.

In the hundred years between 1850 and 1950, the village became well known locally for its cherry orchards, and there remain many references to orchards and cherries in road names and house names.

In 2008 the village formally celebrated 800 years of recorded settlement.

==Social and Community==

The village underwent housing development during the 1960s and early 1970s and now has about 4,000 inhabitants (almost double that of neighboring Little Missenden). The big developments of the 1960s and 1970s included an expanded range of shops around Turners Place, the Winter&#x27;s Way estate, the Fox Road and Harries Way estate and the Holmer Court estate (Clementi Avenue). A significant number of newcomers to the village came from Middlesex during that period.
The village has two centres: a commercial centre based around the shops and central crossroads; and a community-oriented centre based around The Common featuring two churches, the village hall, a school, a pub, a children&#x27;s playground, and The Common itself.

Holmer Green&#x27;s most desirable roads range from older roads like Watchet Lane and Penfold Lane through to newer developments like Mead Park. The village&#x27;s most famous residents are television presenter Fern Britton and her husband, celebrity chef Phil Vickery.

Residents jealously guard the village&#x27;s independence from the Wycombe-based urban sprawl next door. Maintenance of an independent community separate from the Wycombe conurbation has been helped not only by the village&#x27;s historic connections with the Missendens, Penn Street and Amersham but also by the presence in the village of a full range of amenities including: pre-schools; primary and secondary schools; three different Christian denomination churches (Church of England, Baptist, Methodist); a dental practice; three pubs (The Bat and Ball, The Earl Howe and The Old Oak); two social clubs (The British Legion and Holmer Green Sports Association); and significant sports facilities. The village lost its only GP practice in 2018 when the lease on the surgery premises expired.

==Sport and recreation==

The sporting activities hosted by the Holmer Green Sports Association (HGSA) are an important feature of village life. Football is particularly popular and very well established:Non-League football team Holmer Green F.C. celebrated its centenary in 2008 and there are numerous football teams for all age groups – male and female – that play on the four scaled football pitches and two mini pitches.

The grounds and facilities at HGSA in Watchet Lane have been used to host training sessions for England teams and for Wycombe Wanderers, and have recently been awarded FA Community Charter status. Football matches and training sessions for some village teams are also held on The Common. Wycombe Wanderers are in League One.

Other sports at HGSA are: a Padel Tennis club and facilities consisting of two Padel tennis courts which were built in 2021; a Squash club and courts; a Cricket club and cricket square; and a Short Mat Bowls club with a 3-rink outdoor green.

Surrounded as it is by Metropolitan Green Belt countryside, Holmer Green village is well placed for walking, horse riding, and cycling – the Chiltern Heritage Cycling Trail runs right through the centre of the village.

A funfair is held on The Common for several days in May and September.

==Education==
Holmer Green has several pre-schools including: Holmer Green Methodist Pre-School; the Cherry Tree Pre-School; the Village Centre Pre-School; and Playmates Day Nursery.

Holmer Green First School (ages 4–7) and Holmer Green Junior School (ages 7–11) are part of a cluster of local primary schools used by Holmer Green families. A significant proportion of villagers use the Holmer Green schools while others make use of spare places at Little Kingshill School and the Church of England schools at Penn Street and Great Kingshill.

In 2006 Holmer Green Junior School led this cluster of schools at Key Stage 2 and came joint-tenth in the county for aggregated score. Previously, Little Kingshill School led the group. All four primary schools are consistently in the top half of KS2 results in Buckinghamshire.

Most Holmer Green children who are not selected for grammar school under Buckinghamshire&#x27;s 11+ selective system go to either Holmer Green Senior School or to the Sir William Ramsay School (in Hazlemere) which share a common catchment area. A smaller number go to the Misbourne School and the Amersham School despite both being out of catchment.

Local pupils selected for grammar school at age 11 – about a third of all those who sit the test – have customarily attended Amersham and Chesham schools: Dr Challoner&#x27;s Grammar School (boys), Dr Challoner&#x27;s High School (girls) and Chesham Grammar School (mixed). New catchment areas were implemented by Buckinghamshire Local Education Authority in 2004 so that selected pupils may now attend The Royal Grammar School (boys), Beaconsfield High School (girls), or Wycombe High School (girls). Some selected pupils still choose to attend Chesham Grammar School and John Hampden Grammar School (boys) despite both now being out of catchment. In recent years, Year 7 children who qualify for grammar school under Bucks&#x27; late transfer procedure (known colloquially as &quot;The 12+&quot;) have been able to win places at Chesham Grammar School.

A number of private schools are available in nearby villages and towns. The Gateway School (primary), the Claires Court Schools (for which there is a coach to &amp; from Holmer Green) and Pipers Corner School (primary and secondary girls) are popular with villagers who choose the independent sector.

It is said that Holmer Green people enjoy an unusually wide choice of schools.

==Religion==
According to the 2001 Census, 77.8% of Holmer Green&#x27;s population is Christian, while both Sikhism and Buddhism have 0.2% each. 0.3% of Holmer Green&#x27;s inhabitants identified as Jewish, while 0.6% identified as Muslims. Alternative religions made up 0.1% of the population, while 14% identified as atheists and 75 did not state a religion. This overwhelming majority of Christians is also reflected in the places of worship. While, previously, Holmer Green has had 3 Churches, an Anglican church, a Baptist church and a Methodist church, following Covid-19 the Methodist church announced that it would be shutting down. Then, it announced it final closure was not guaranteed and as of 2024, its current and future status is currently ambiguous to even its own churchgoers. Meanwhile, the Baptist church focuses on bringing Children into the church, partnering often with the next door Holmer Green Junior School, running events such as messy church, in which children do activities and can participate in small prayer sessions or passage reading. Furthermore, the Baptist church focuses a lot on making themselves family friendly, such as focusing greatly on their christenings. Finally, the Anglican church, officially Christ&#x27;s church, focuses much more on Adults and the elderly moving into the village and giving them a place of worship. This is further reinforced by doing burial services in the only grave yard in the village in the land surrounding the church building itself, also owned by Christ&#x27;s church. Nearby as well are two more churches nearby in Hazlemere, an Anglican one, called the Holy Trinity Church and another Methodist church, run by the same organisation as the one in Holmer Green itself, known as the Hazlemere Free Methodist Church. Finally there is a nearby church in Widmer end known as the Church of the Good Sheppard, with no clear denomination. Catholics and other religions must travel into nearby High Wycombe, Chesham or Amersham, where a plethora of Catholic Churches, Mosques and other places of worship exist.

==Transport==

Holmer Green is near the A404 road, which links junctions of the M4, M40 and M25 motorways.

Being only a short drive from both Amersham to the east, and High Wycombe to the south-west, the village is suitably located for commuting into London by main line trains on the Chiltern line which takes about 40 minutes, or on the Metropolitan line which is slower. Some of the working population commute to London every day. The proportion of London commuters is however lower than some surrounding villages – most villagers work in Buckinghamshire, Berkshire or Hertfordshire. The village is about 25 minutes&#x27; drive from London Heathrow Airport and an hour&#x27;s drive from Gatwick, Luton, and Stansted airports.

Regular bus services operated by Carousel Buses and Arriva Shires &amp; Essex connect Holmer Green to High Wycombe, Amersham and Chesham.

==Politics and Public Administration==

Seven parish councillors represent Holmer Green on Little Missenden&#x27;s thirteen-seat parish council which has offices at Rossetti Hall in Holmer Green. The councillors are formally independent of political parties. Holmer Green has long elected two Conservative district councillors to the Conservative-run Chiltern District Council. Holmer Green is also represented by Conservatives at County and Parliamentary levels.

Holmer Green has been part of Chesham and Amersham Parliamentary Constituency since its creation in 1974. Between 1950 and 1974, the village formed part of the larger South Buckinghamshire constituency, and prior to 1950, it was a part of the historic Aylesbury constituency. As such, the village was last represented by a non-Conservative in 1923, when the Liberal Thomas Keens was elected.

It is not however entirely accurate to say that Holmer Green has never been represented by a Labour MP. Until quite recently, the far south-west corner of Holmer Green around the appropriately-named Wycombe Road was actually a part of Hughenden parish, Wycombe District and therefore Wycombe constituency. This peculiarity had resulted from the village&#x27;s steady growth towards Hazlemere and across an old Hundred and parish boundary. Between 1945 and 1951, Wycombe and therefore a handful of Holmer Green houses were represented by Labour MP John Edwin Haire.

The peculiarity was addressed and the village finally unified inside Little Missenden parish, Chiltern District and Chesham and Amersham constituency following the movement of the administrative boundary to the top of Sawpit Hill in 1987.

The 2011 proposals for parliamentary constituency boundary changes has kept Holmer Green in Chesham and Amersham constituency.

==Demography==
The 2001 Census recorded Holmer Green&#x27;s electoral ward as having a population of 4,077. The ethnicity was 97.8% white, 0.5% mixed race, 1.1% Asian, 0.4% black and 0.2% other.

<text>Desmond Keith Carter (October 15, 1967 – December 10, 2002) was convicted of the 1992 murder of Helen Purdy and executed in 2002 by the state of North Carolina at the Central Prison in Raleigh.

Desmond Carter was born in the state of Rhode Island and lived with his maternal grandmother since his mother moved away when Carter was 3. Eventually, he moved with his paternal grandmother to North Carolina.

Carter started using drugs as a teenager and on March 9, 1992, under the influence of alcohol, crack cocaine, and tranquilizers, killed his 71-year-old neighbor, Helen Purdy, by stabbing her 13 times with a butcher knife, and robbed her of $15 in order to buy cocaine. Not long before Carter committed this crime, his grandmother had tried to get substance abuse and mental health treatment for him, but the hospital refused because he did not have medical insurance coverage.

In July 1993, Carter was sentenced to death for first degree murder and to 40 years imprisonment for robbery with a dangerous weapon. On the eve of his execution, Carter declined a special meal. Instead, he bought two cheeseburgers, a steak sub, and two Cokes from the prison canteen, for which he paid $4.20 from his prison account. He was executed by means of lethal injection on December 10, 2002.

Carter mouthed &quot;I love you, pop&quot; to his father before the drug from the injection put him to sleep. In a statement that was recorded by the warden of Central Prison, Carter said: &quot;The only thing I would like to say is that I apologize to the victim&#x27;s family of Ms. Purdy and I would like to apologize to my family for the disappointment and pain I have caused them throughout my life.&quot;

<text>Horsenden is a hamlet and former civil parish, now in the parish of Longwick-cum-Ilmer, in Buckinghamshire, England. It is approximately one mile West of Princes Risborough, seven miles south of Aylesbury and three miles south-west of Chinnor in Oxfordshire. The Icknield Way passes just to the north of the village from north-east to south-west, although there is no connecting road through the hamlet itself. In 1931 the parish had a population of 53.

==Name==
The name Horsenden is from the Anglo Saxon &quot;Horsan-dun&quot; and means &#x27;Horsa&#x27;s hill or valley&#x27;. Horsa was one of the first Anglo Saxon settlers of Britain, who settled in Kent in the Fifth century. The association of the area to Horsa is unknown.

==History==
After the Norman Conquest the land was in the possession of the Count of Mortain. After 1215 it was passed to Robert de Braybrook. Sir John Donne then acquired the estates in 1480. Horsenden House as it was then known was garrisoned during the English Civil War for Charles I by the Royalist Sir John Denham who managed to maintain possession after the Restoration. 

During the 18th and 19th century there were a number of owners and the House slipped into neglect. In 1810, the House was restored and rebuilt and sometime later renamed Horsenden Manor. 

At the height of The Blitz during the Second World War, the insurance company Norwich Union moved their offices from Piccadilly, Fleet Street and St James&#x27; into the Manor but after the war they moved back to their London offices. 

Jamiroquai front man Jay Kay has owned Horsenden Manor as his primary residence since 1995 and has a recording studio, granary and garages for his top-end car collection. In 2020 he applied to extend the property.

The parish church is dedicated to St Michael and All Angels. The church has sat on the same site since 1210, however part of the building is 15th century at its eldest. In 1765, the nave and west tower were demolished and the current tower was built, it still contains its original bell dated 1582 and in the late 19th century the chancel was extended 8 feet to the east. 

The hamlet has its own tennis club, and on the same site can be found Princes Risborough&#x27;s football and cricket teams.

On 1 April 1934 the parish was abolished to form &quot;Longwick cum Ilmer&quot; and Bledlow cum Saunderton, part also went to Princes Risborough.

<text>Horton is a village and civil parish in Berkshire, England. It is between Windsor and Staines-upon-Thames.

==History and etymology==
The village name is a common one in England. It is Old English in origin and derives from the two words &quot;horu&quot; &#x27;dirt&#x27; and &quot;tūn&quot; &#x27;settlement, farm, estate&#x27;, presumably meaning &#x27;farm on muddy soil&#x27;. In the Domesday Book of 1086 it was recorded as &quot;Hortune&quot;. The Horton Manor was assessed at 10 hides and held by Walter son of Other.

==Geography==
Through the Horton parish flows the Colne Brook which runs to the River Thames from the River Colne. railway station is nearest to its southern end, and railway station is nearest to its western end. Heathrow Airport is to its east, separated from Horton by the M25 motorway. Horton has a local nature reserve, the Arthur Jacob Nature Reserve.

==Parish church==
The Church of England parish church of St Michael has a 12th-century nave, with an ornate Norman arch over the north door in the porch. The north transept is 15th century and the square bell-tower is late 16th century. The aisle, chancel and vestry were rebuilt in 1875–76. The exterior of the church is chequered with brickwork, limestone and flint. The tower is square and between high. It has a clock, and the ring of bells was augmented from five to six in 1987.

==Governance==
Horton was transferred from Buckinghamshire to Berkshire in 1974. At parish level the village is represented by nine councillors of the Horton Parish Council. At borough level the town is part of the Datchet Horton and Wraysbury electoral ward and is currently represented by three councillors, David Cannon (Conservative), Ewan Larcombe (independent) and Gary Muir (Conservative), in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead. Nationally, since 1997 the ward has formed part of the UK Parliamentary constituency of Windsor, which has been represented since 2005 by Adam Afriyie of the Conservative Party. Before 1997 the town was part of the UK Parliamentary constituency of Windsor and Maidenhead which was consistently held by the Conservative Party.

==Notable residents==
John Milton the English poet is one of the more famous former residents of Horton. His family rented &quot;Berkyn Manor&quot;, a house that belonged to Sir John Egerton, in the parish between 1632 and 1640. The chancel of St Michael&#x27;s parish church contains the grave of Milton&#x27;s mother Sara; and a 19th-century stained glass window on the church commemorates Milton&#x27;s poem Paradise Lost. The current &quot;Berkyn Manor&quot; was rebuilt in 1848 by Edward Tyrrell (Remembrancer of the City of London) reputedly on the site of Milton&#x27;s house.

<doc id="413043" wikidata="Q7075072" url="?curid=413043" title="Objectification">
<text>In social philosophy, objectification is the act of treating a person as an object or a thing. It is part of dehumanization, the act of disavowing the humanity of others. Sexual objectification, the act of treating a person as a mere object of sexual desire, is a subset of objectification, as is self-objectification, the objectification of one&#x27;s self. In Marxism, the objectification of social relationships is discussed as &quot;reification&quot;.

== Definitions ==
According to Martha Nussbaum, a person is objectified if one or more of the following properties are applied to them:
# Instrumentality – treating the person as a tool for another&#x27;s purposes
# Denial of autonomy – treating the person as lacking in autonomy or self-determination
# Inertness – treating the person as lacking in agency or activity
# Fungibility – treating the person as interchangeable with (other) objects
# Violability – treating the person as lacking in boundary integrity and violable, &quot;as something that it is permissible to break up, smash, break into.&quot;
# Ownership – treating the person as though they can be owned, bought, or sold (such as slavery)
# Denial of subjectivity – treating the person as though there is no need for concern for their experiences or feelings

Rae Langton proposed three more properties to be added to Nussbaum&#x27;s list:
# Reduction to body – the treatment of a person as identified with their body, or body parts
# Reduction to appearance – the treatment of a person primarily in terms of how they look, or how they appear to the senses
# Silencing – the treatment of a person as if they are silent, lacking the capacity to speak

==Arguments==
Nussbaum found the general understanding of objectification was too simplistic to be useful as a normative concept to evaluate the moral implications of sexualization of women. She attempts to remedy this by distinguishing between benign and harmful forms of objectification in different circumstances relative to sex.
Nussbaum considers objectification not just significant when considering sexuality, which has been discussed at length, but also an important component of the Marxist view on capitalism and slavery. She argues that not all forms of objectification are necessarily inherently negative, and that objectification is not necessarily a foregone conclusion when one of the seven properties is present.

According to Immanuel Kant&#x27;s theories, sexual desire is inherently objectifying, as a strong sexual urge includes a desire to engulf another person for sexual satisfaction. This desire manifests as a desire to control the target&#x27;s behaviour to secure one&#x27;s own satisfaction, effectively denying the target&#x27;s autonomy. The intensity of sexual desire also reduces subjectivity by drowning out consideration of the target&#x27;s thoughts or feelings in the pursuit of one&#x27;s own satisfaction, reducing other people to a set of body parts intended to provide gratification. In short, sexual objectification is a general feature of sexuality, in that the involved parties eagerly desire both to objectify and be objectified.

Catherine Mackinnon and Andrea Dworkin adopt Kant&#x27;s understanding of sex as inherently objectifying, but disagree that participants are objectifiers and objectified in similar proportion; rather, it is asymmetrical. Because sexuality exists within a larger social and culture context and men and women do are not granted power equally within that context, this heavily influences the dynamic. According to Mackinnon and Dworkin, male sexuality is expressed dominantly via objectifying others, while female sexuality is expressed submissively via accepting objectification or engaging in self-objectification. In this context, women are more vulnerable to violability and lack of subjectivity and autonomy. Mackinnon and Dworkin ignore personal histories and psychologies that Nussbaum considers equally morally important to the construction of male and female sexualities.

While male gaze is one of the main enablers of self-objectification, social media is a medium that heavily promotes and enforces self-objectification, especially in women. Women post selfies on social media from camera angles that typify the male gaze perspective, while the comments section provides a forum for viewers to voice disapproval or praise. Positive feedback brings a sense of validation to women who post these selfies and reinforces the behaviour.

== Feminist objectification theory ==
The objectification theory proposed by Barbara Fredrickson and Tomi-Ann Roberts analyzes the female body with consideration to the psychology of women and gender. They assert that objectifying a woman or a girl can cause an increased feeling of anxiety or self-awareness in her, thus affecting her mental health. As a result of this objectification, the target adopts the status that society has given to her as her primary view of herself. In their words: &quot;Perhaps the most profound and pervasive of these experiences is the disruption in the flow of consciousness that results as many girls and women internalize the culture&#x27;s practices of objectification and habitually monitor their bodies&#x27; appearance.&quot;

The pressure of this external perspective can lead to body monitoring and obsessive eating patterns, eventually resulting in feelings of shame or anxiety. According to Fredrickson and Roberts, newer waves of feminists and scholars have recontextualized the female body in a sociocultural perspective, emphasizing its sociocultural representation over its biological role. They argue that the one conceptualization should not overshadow the other, as both combine to form the social construction of female body image.

== Intersectionality and transgender experiences ==
Sexual objectification experiences can vary according to an individual&#x27;s intersectional identity markers. Utilizing an intersectional approach can deepen the understandings of objectification constructs pertaining to transgender identities. Transgender individuals experience unique challenges during the interpretation of their identity.

Mirella Flores argues that prior explorations into the topic of objectification have been primarily focused on the experiences of cisgender people. Transgender individuals have been excluded from the discourse of objectification as their expressed gender has been historically invalidated. For example, the traditional heteronormativity displayed in the field of psychology has previously enabled the conceptualization of gender non-conformity as a mental disorder. Furthermore, representations of transgender individuals in the media have portrayed them as comic relief, perpetuating transphobia, and further stigmatizing transgender individuals. Sexual orientation standards are inserted into social representations of gender as either masculine or feminine and this gender binary has been propagated through the media, peers, family, and other socio-cultural channels. Through objectification and social representation, exaggerated body image ideals associated with masculinity and femininity encourage the objectification of one&#x27;s body in order to adhere to these socio-cultural appearance ideals. Although the theory of objectification was originally used to explain how the female body is reduced to its appearance, it can be used to analyze how transgender individuals approximate these ideals to be consistent with their gender.

The low level of social acceptance of transgender individuals provokes devaluation and stigmatization. Transgender individuals may internalize societal appearance ideals through body monitoring and comparison in order to legitimize their gender identity. Some transgender individuals feel as if they must adopt the binary body image and act towards it in order to fit into societal standards. Objectification ignores gender identity and categorizes individuals based on the ideal expression of gender which affects transitioned men and transitioned women. Objectification becomes a problem and solution for individuals attempting to affirm their gender identity and expression through social recognition. The ideal male physical attractiveness includes the portrayal of muscle and robustness and transgender men can attempt to conform to the standard through compulsive exercise and steroid injection. Transgender women experience similar objectification as cisgender women do according to the reduction of one&#x27;s self to a mere hypersexualized body Transgender individuals may attempt to affirm their gender identity through illegal practices such as using silicone injections that eventually results in harmful health consequences Furthermore, transgender individuals may seek gender affirmation through sex work, increasing the risk of sexually transmitted diseases. The discrepancy of appearance (e.g., height and body structure) may impede transgender individuals&#x27; alignment with their gender identity and they do not feel as if they fit the social standards even after medical interventions. Transgender individuals may internalize the negative stereotypes perpetuated through sexual objectification such as &quot;transgender prostitute&quot; which has been found to induce stereotype affirming behaviors. Internalization of negative stereotypes have been linked to low self-esteem, devaluation, feelings of worthlessness and in the worst case, suicide.

<doc id="413046" wikidata="Q1426328" url="?curid=413046" title="Japanese aircraft carrier Shōhō">
<text>Shōhō (Japanese: 祥鳳, &quot;Auspicious Phoenix&quot; or &quot;Happy Phoenix&quot;) was a light aircraft carrier of the Imperial Japanese Navy. Originally built as the submarine support ship &quot;Tsurugizaki&quot; (Japanese: 剣埼, &quot;Sword Cape&quot;) in the late 1930s, she was converted before the Pacific War into an aircraft carrier and renamed. Completed in early 1942, the ship supported the invasion forces in Operation MO, the invasion of Port Moresby, New Guinea, and was sunk by American carrier aircraft on her first combat operation during the Battle of the Coral Sea on 7 May. &quot;Shōhō&quot; was the first Japanese aircraft carrier to be sunk during World War II.

==Design, construction and conversion==

&quot;Shōhō&quot; and her sister were designed to be easily modified as an oil tanker, submarine tender, or aircraft carrier as needed. &quot;Shōhō&quot; was laid down by the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 3 December 1934 as the submarine tender &quot;Tsurugizaki&quot;. She was launched on 1 June 1935 and completed on 15 January 1939. Not long after the ship was initially completed, she began reconstruction as an aircraft carrier in 1941. Her superstructure was removed and replaced by a flight deck with a hangar for her aircraft below. Renamed &quot;Shōhō&quot;, the conversion was finished on 26 January 1942.
After her conversion, &quot;Shōhō&quot; had a length of overall. She had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced at standard load. As part of her conversion, her original diesel engines, which had given her a top speed of , were replaced by a pair of destroyer-type geared steam turbine sets with a total of , each driving one propeller. Steam was provided by four Kampon water-tube boilers and &quot;Shōhō&quot; now had a maximum speed of . The boilers exhausted through a single downturned starboard funnel and she carried of fuel oil, giving her a range of at a speed of . Her crew numbered 785 officers and men.

&quot;Shōhō&quot;″s flight deck was long and had a maximum width of . The ship was designed with a single hangar long and wide. The hangar was served by two octagonal centerline aircraft elevators. The forward elevator was in size and the smaller rear elevator measured . She had arresting gear with six cables, but she was not fitted with an aircraft catapult. &quot;Shōhō&quot; was a flush-deck design and lacked an island superstructure. She was designed to operate 30 aircraft.

The ship&#x27;s primary armament consisted of eight 40-caliber 12.7 cm Type 89 anti-aircraft (AA) guns in twin mounts on sponsons along the sides of the hull. &quot;Shōhō&quot; was also initially equipped with four twin 25 mm Type 96 light AA guns, also in sponsons along the sides of the hull.

==Service history==

&quot;Shōhō&quot; was commissioned on 30 November 1941 and Captain Ishinosuke Izawa became her commanding officer. While still fitting-out, the ship was assigned to the Fourth Carrier Division of the 1st Air Fleet on 22 December. On 4 February 1942, she ferried aircraft to Truk, where she remained until 11 April before returning to Yokosuka.

In late April 1942, &quot;Shōhō&quot; was assigned to Operation MO and arrived in Truk on 29 April. The following day, she departed Truk with the cruisers , , , and of Cruiser Division 6 under the command of Rear Admiral Aritomo Gotō. They formed the Main Force of the operation. Due to aircraft shortages, her aircraft complement consisted of only four obsolete Mitsubishi A5M4 &quot;Claude&quot; and eight modern Mitsubishi A6M2 &quot;Zero&quot; fighters plus six Nakajima B5N2 &quot;Kate&quot; torpedo bombers. Covering the other elements of Operation MO was the Striking Force that consisted of the fleet carriers and .

===Battle of the Coral Sea===
After covering the landings on Tulagi on 3 May, &quot;Shōhō&quot; headed north to cover the invasion convoy the next day and was not present when aircraft from the American carrier attacked Japanese shipping at Tulagi. This air strike confirmed that at least one American carrier was in the vicinity, but the Japanese had no idea of its location. They launched a number of reconnaissance aircraft the following day to search for the Americans, but without result. One Kawanishi H6K &quot;Mavis&quot; flying boat spotted &quot;Yorktown&quot;, but was shot down by one of &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters before she could radio a report. US Army Air Forces (USAAF) aircraft spotted &quot;Shōhō&quot; southwest of Bougainville Island on 5 May, but she was too far north to be attacked by the American carriers, which were refueling. That day, Rear Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher received Magic intelligence that placed the three Japanese carriers known to be involved in Operation MO near Bougainville, and predicted 10 May as the date of the invasion. It also predicted airstrikes by the Japanese carriers in support of the invasion several days before 10 May. Based on this information, Fletcher planned to complete refuelling his ships on 6 May and move closer to the eastern tip of New Guinea to be in a position to locate and attack Japanese forces on 7 May.

Another H6K spotted the Americans during the morning of 6 May and successfully shadowed them until 14:00. The Japanese, however, were unwilling or unable to launch air strikes in poor weather or without updated spot reports. Both sides believed they knew where the other force was, and expected to fight the next day. The Japanese were the first to spot the Americans when one aircraft found the oiler escorted by the destroyer at 0722, south of the Strike Force. These ships were misidentified as a carrier and a cruiser and the carriers &quot;Shōkaku&quot; and &quot;Zuikaku&quot; launched an airstrike 40 minutes later that sank &quot;Sims&quot; and damaged &quot;Neosho&quot; badly enough that she had to be scuttled a few days later. The American carriers were west of the Strike Force, not south, and they were spotted by other Japanese aircraft shortly after the carriers had launched their attack on &quot;Neosho&quot; and &quot;Sims&quot;.

American reconnaissance aircraft reported two Japanese heavy cruisers northeast of Misima Island in the Louisiade Archipelago off the eastern tip of New Guinea at 07:35 and two carriers at 08:15. An hour later, Fletcher ordered an airstrike launched, believing that the two carriers reported were &quot;Shōkaku&quot; and &quot;Zuikaku&quot;. and &quot;Yorktown&quot; launched a total of 53 Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers and 22 Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo planes escorted by 18 F4F Wildcats. The 0815 report turned out to be miscoded, as the pilot had intended to report two heavy cruisers, but USAAF aircraft had spotted &quot;Shōhō&quot;, her escorts and the invasion convoy in the meantime. As the latest spot report plotted only away from the 0815 report, the aircraft en route were diverted to this new target.
&quot;Shōhō&quot; and the rest of the Main Force were spotted by aircraft from &quot;Lexington&quot; at 10:40. At this time, &quot;Shōhō&quot;″s combat air patrol (CAP) consisted of two A5Ms and one A6M Zero. The Dauntlesses began their attack at 11:10 as the three Japanese fighters attacked them in their dive. None of the dive bombers hit &quot;Shōhō&quot;, which was maneuvering to avoid their bombs; one Dauntless was shot down by the Zero after it had pulled out of its dive and several others were damaged. The carrier launched three more Zeros immediately after this attack to reinforce its CAP. The second wave of Dauntlesses began their attack at 11:18 and they hit &quot;Shōhō&quot; twice with bombs. These penetrated the ship&#x27;s flight deck and burst inside her hangars, setting the fuelled and armed aircraft there on fire. A minute later, the Devastators began dropping their torpedoes from both sides of the ship. They hit &quot;Shōhō&quot; five times and the damage from the hits knocked out her steering and power and flooded both engine and boiler rooms. &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s aircraft trailed those from &quot;Lexington&quot;, and the former&#x27;s Dauntlesses began their attacks at 11:25, hitting &quot;Shōhō&quot; with another eleven 1,000-pound bombs by Japanese accounts and the carrier came to a complete stop. &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s Devastators trailed the rest of her aircraft and attacked at 11:29. They claimed ten hits, although Japanese accounts acknowledge only two. As the Devastators were exiting the area, they were attacked by the CAP, but the Wildcats protecting the torpedo bombers shot down two A5Ms and an A6M Zero. Total American losses to all causes were three Dauntlesses. After his attack, Lieutenant Commander Robert E. Dixon, commander of &quot;Lexington&quot;″s dive bombers, radioed his famous message to the American carriers: &quot;Scratch one flat top!&quot;

With &quot;Shōhō&quot; hit by no fewer than 13 bombs and 7 torpedoes, Captain Izawa ordered the ship abandoned at 11:31. She sank four minutes later. Some 300 men successfully abandoned the ship, but they had to wait to be rescued as Gotō ordered his remaining ships to head north at high speed to avoid any further airstrikes. Around 14:00, he ordered the destroyer to return to the scene and rescue the survivors. She found only 203, including Captain Izawa. The rest of her crew of 834 died during the attack or in the water awaiting rescue. &quot;Shōhō&quot; was the first Japanese aircraft carrier lost during the war.

<text>Horton is a hamlet in the parish of Ivinghoe, in Buckinghamshire, England. It is in the civil parish of Slapton.

The name &quot;Horton&quot; is a common one in England. It derives from Old English &quot;horu&quot; &#x27;dirt&#x27; and &quot;tūn&quot; &#x27;settlement, farm, estate&#x27;, presumably meaning &#x27;farm on muddy soil&#x27;.

Although in the parish of Ivinghoe, the hamlet is nearer to Cheddington with its shops and churches, so that is the main village to which most residents of Horton feel most attached.

On the 14 February 1942 a Royal Air Force De Havilland Dragon Rapide (R5927) was operating a training flight out of RAF Yatesbury. The pilots lost control of the aircraft after hitting a balloon cable. The aircraft came down in an area of Horton known as Wiggins Field &amp; caught fire on impact. All six crew &amp; one person in the ground died in the accident.

The hamlet of Horton was held after the Norman Conquest by the de Brocas family. The hamlet is very small, but a few new modern houses have been built over the last twenty years, most notably Brocas Way and The Grange. The latter was built in the 1970s as a dower house for Horton Hall.

Horton Hall is a large moated farmhouse with 18th-century origins. It is probably on the site of the original manor or hall. It was the home of Norman Shand-Kydd, a charity fund-raiser, and former champion amateur jockey, who bred horses on the adjoining farm.
Two 16th-century half-timbered cottages remain in the village. One, still known as &quot;King&#x27;s Head Cottage&quot;, used to be an inn. The other, which is older, is a renovated Tudor hall on the outskirts of the hamlet.

==Notable residents==
* Roger Goad (1538-1610), academic, theologian, Provost of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge and three times Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge University. Born in Horton
* John Milton (1562–1647), the composer, moved here from Hammersmith in 1636 with his wife, Sara, and family, including the poet John Milton (1608 – 1674). In 1641, he moved to Reading, Berkshire.
* Robert Scawen (1602-1670), politician and member of parliament of the House of Commons of England that supported the parliamentarian side of the English Civil War. Moved to Horton in 1658 until his death.
* Horace Davey, Baron Davey (1833-1907), judge, politician and member of parliament of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom from 1880 until 1892.

<text>Hulcott is a village and civil parish in Aylesbury Vale district in Buckinghamshire, England. It is north of Aylesbury, off the road that runs between Bierton and Rowsham. It is in the civil parish of Bierton with Broughton

The village toponym is derived from the Old English for &quot;hovel-like cottage&quot;. In the manorial records of 1200 it was recorded as &quot;Hoccote&quot;. Up to the 17th century the village name was pronounced .

The manor at Hulcott has, for a long time, been part of the manorial district of Aylesbury. In the Domesday Book of 1086 the village&#x27;s returns were included with those of the nearby town and as such are indistinguishable from them. It is, however, a separate civil parish.

The village is arranged around a traditional village green. In recent times the main A418 road has been rerouted so that it no longer runs through the village. Recently a new golf club opened on land adjacent to the village.

The Church of England parish church of All Saints has an early 14th-century chancel arch.

<text>Hyde Heath is a village in the civil parish of Little Missenden, in the Buckinghamshire district of the ceremonial county of Buckinghamshire, England. It is located in the Chiltern Hills, around northeast of the village of Little Missenden and northwest of Amersham.

The village&#x27;s name refers to the value of the estate that once stood there. The heath was valued at the price of one hide, an amount of land enough to support one free family and its dependants.

Currently there is a primary school, pre school, toddler group, nursing home &quot;Rayners,&quot; a pub and restaurant &quot;The Plough&quot;, a Village Hall &amp; Shop and a car mechanics garage &quot;Heath Motors&quot;.

Hyde Heath is also host to one of the largest village fetes in the country, held in May of each year. It incorporates many traditional games and stalls and a dog show, as well as various displays (such as falconry and acrobatic demonstrations from the local school), tea and coffees, a large BBQ and ice cream stand, and an ever-popular Classic Car Display.

Also there is the annual Hyde Heath Beer Festival held on the village Green in June.

== Churches ==
Hyde Heath has two churches. The Baptists were active in Hyde Heath since the 1800s. A church was established which was a branch of Amersham and then became a branch of Chesham Lower Baptist church (now Trinity). The chapel is now a house called &quot;The Olde Chapel&quot; on the Common. It had its own burial ground. In 1932 they built the current chapel in Bray&#x27;s Lane called &quot;Union Chapel&quot; which was meant to be a Free church.

There was a Mission Room of Little Missenden Church in Hyde Heath in the 1880s and 1890s. After Hyde Heath School was built the Parish of Chesham held services in the school. They then built a Mission Room in 1909. This is now called St Andrew&#x27;s Church and is part of Little Missenden parish.

<doc id="413064" wikidata="Q203233" url="?curid=413064" title="Battle of Plassey">
<text>The Battle of Plassey was a decisive victory of the British East India Company, under the leadership of Robert Clive, over the Nawab of Bengal and his French allies on 23 June 1757. The victory was made possible by the defection of Mir Jafar, Nawab Siraj-ud-Daulah&#x27;s commander in chief as well as much of the Bengal Subah&#x27;s armies being earlier committed against an Afghan invasion led by Ahmad Shah Durrani against the Mughal Empire. The battle helped the British East India Company take control of Bengal in 1772. Over the next hundred years, they continued to expand their control over vast territories in the rest of the Indian subcontinent, including Burma.

The battle took place at Palashi (Anglicised version: &quot;Plassey&quot;) on the banks of the Hooghly River, about north of Calcutta (now Kolkata) and south of Murshidabad in West Bengal, then capital of Bengal Subah. The belligerents were the British East India Company, and the Nawab Siraj-ud-Daulah, the last independent Nawab of Bengal. He succeeded Alivardi Khan (his maternal grandfather). Siraj-ud-Daulah had become the Nawab of Bengal the year before, and he had ordered the English to stop the extension of their fortification. Robert Clive bribed Mir Jafar, the commander-in-chief of the Nawab&#x27;s army, and also promised to make him Nawab of Bengal. Clive defeated Siraj-ud-Daulah at Plassey in 1757 and captured Calcutta.

The battle was preceded by an attack on British-controlled Calcutta by Nawab Siraj-ud-Daulah and the Black Hole massacre. The British sent reinforcements under Colonel Robert Clive and Admiral Charles Watson from Madras to Bengal and recaptured Calcutta. Clive then seized the initiative to capture the French fort of Chandannagar. Tensions and suspicions between Siraj-ud-daulah and the British culminated in the Battle of Plassey. The battle was waged during the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763), and, in a mirror of their European rivalry, the French East India Company &quot;(La Compagnie des Indes Orientales)&quot; sent a small contingent to fight against the British. Siraj-ud-Daulah had a vastly numerically superior force and made his stand at Plassey. The British were worried about being outnumbered, formed a conspiracy with Siraj-ud-Daulah&#x27;s demoted army chief Mir Jafar, along with others such as Yar Lutuf Khan, Jagat Seths (Mahtab Chand and Swarup Chand), Umichand and Rai Durlabh. Mir Jafar, Rai Durlabh and Yar Lutuf Khan thus assembled their troops near the battlefield but made no move to actually join the battle. Siraj-ud-Daulah&#x27;s army with about 50,000 soldiers (including defectors), 40 cannons and 10 war elephants was defeated by 3,000 soldiers of Col. Robert Clive, owing to the flight of Siraj-ud-Daulah from the battlefield and the inactivity of the conspirators. The battle ended in approximately 11 hours.

This is judged to be one of the pivotal battles in the control of Indian subcontinent by the colonial powers. The British now had a great deal of wealth and influence over the Nawab, Mir Jafar, and as a result, they were able to get important concessions for earlier losses and trade income. The British further used this revenue to increase their military right and push the other European colonial powers such as the Dutch and the French out of South Asia, thus expanding the British Empire.

==Background==
The Bengal Subah (also referred to as the &quot;Mughal Bengal&quot;) was the largest subdivision of the Mughal Empire and later an independent state under the Nawab of Bengal encompassing much of the Bengal region, which includes modern Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal, between the 16th and 18th centuries. From 1741 to 1751, the Marathas under Raghuji Bhonsle invaded Bengal six times. In 1751, the Marathas signed a peace treaty with the Nawab of Bengal, according to which Mir Habib (a former courtier of Alivardi Khan, who had defected to the Marathas) was made provincial governor of Orissa under nominal control of the Nawab of Bengal. It made The Nawab of Bengal a tributary to the Marathas who agrees to pay Rs. 1.2 million annually as the &quot;chauth&quot; of Bengal and Bihar, and the Marathas agreed not to invade Bengal again. The Nawab of Bengal also paid Rs. 3.2 million to the Marathas, towards the arrears of &quot;chauth&quot; for the preceding years.

The British East India Company had a strong presence in India with its three main stations of Fort St. George in Madras, Fort William in Calcutta, and Bombay Castle in western India since the Anglo-Mughal War. These stations were independent presidencies governed by a president and a council, appointed by the Court of Directors in England. The British adopted a policy of allying themselves with various princes and Nawabs, promising security against usurpers and rebels. The Nawabs often gave them concessions in return for the security.

By the 18th century all rivalry had ceased between the British East India Company and the Dutch or Portuguese counterparts. The French had also established an East India Company under Louis XIV and had two important stations in India – Chandernagar in Bengal and Pondicherry (now Puducherry district) on the Carnatic coast, both governed by the presidency of Pondicherry. The French were a late comer in India trade, but they quickly established themselves in India and were poised to overtake Britain for control.

===Carnatic Wars===
The War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748) marked the beginning of the power struggle between Britain and France and of European military ascendancy and political intervention in the Indian subcontinent. In September 1746, Mahé de La Bourdonnais landed off Madras with a naval squadron and laid siege to the port city. The defenses of Madras were weak and the garrison sustained a bombardment of three days before surrendering. The terms of the surrender agreed by Bourdonnais provided for the settlement to be ransomed back for a cash payment by the British East India Company. However, this concession was opposed by Joseph François Dupleix, the governor general of the Indian possessions of the Compagnie des Indes Orientales. When Bourdonnais left India in October, Dupleix reneged on the agreement. The Nawab of the Carnatic Anwaruddin Khan intervened in support of the British and the combined forces advanced to retake Madras, but despite vast superiority in numbers, the army was easily crushed by the French. As retaliation to the loss of Madras, the British, under Major Lawrence and Admiral Boscawen, laid siege to Pondicherry but were forced to raise it after thirty-one days. The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748 forced Dupleix to yield Madras back to the British in return for Louisbourg and Cape Breton Island in North America.
The Treaty of Aix-La-Chapelle prevented direct hostilities between the two powers but soon they were involved in indirect hostilities as the auxiliaries of the local princes in their feuds. The feud Dupleix chose was for the succession to the positions of the Nizam of the Deccan and the Nawab of the dependent Carnatic province. The British and the French both nominated their candidates for the two posts. In both cases, Dupleix&#x27;s candidates usurped both thrones by manipulation and two assassinations. In mid-1751, the French candidate for the Nawab&#x27;s post, Chanda Sahib, laid siege to the British candidate Wallajah&#x27;s last stronghold Trichinopoly, where Wallajah was holed up with his British reinforcements. He was aided by a French force under Charles, Marquis de Bussy.

On 1 September 1751, 280 Europeans and 300 sepoys under the command of Captain Robert Clive attacked and seized Arcot, the capital of the Carnatic, finding that the garrison had fled the night before. It was hoped that this would force Chanda Sahib to divert some of his troops to wrest the city back from the British. Chanda Sahib sent a force of 4,000 Indians under Raza Sahib and 150 Frenchmen. They besieged the fort and breached the walls in various places after several weeks. Clive sent out a message to Morari Rao, a Maratha chieftain who had received a subsidy to assist Wallajah and was encamped in the Mysore hills. Raza Sahib, learning of the imminent Maratha approach, sent a letter to Clive asking him to surrender in return for a large sum of money but this offer was refused. In the morning of 24 November, Raza Sahib tried to mount a final assault on the fort but was foiled in his attempt when his armoured elephants stampeded due to the British musketry. They tried to enter the fort through the breach several times but always repulsed with loss. The siege was raised the next day and Raza Sahib&#x27;s forces fled from the scene, abandoning guns, ammunition and stores. With success at Arcot, Conjeeveram and Trichinopoly, the British secured the Carnatic and Wallajah succeeded to the throne of the Nawab in accordance with a treaty with the new French governor Godeheu.

Alwardi Khan ascended to the throne of the Nawab of Bengal after his army attacked and captured the capital of Bengal, Murshidabad. Alivardi&#x27;s attitude to the Europeans in Bengal is said to be strict. During the Maratha invasions of Bengal, he allowed the strengthening of fortifications by the Europeans and the construction of the Maratha Ditch in Calcutta by the British. On the other hand, he collected large amounts of money from them for the upkeep of his war. He was well-informed of the situation in southern India, where the British and the French had started a proxy war using the local princes and rulers. Alwardi did not wish such a situation to transpire in his province and thus exercised caution in his dealings with the Europeans. However, there was continual friction; the British always complained that they were prevented from the full enjoyment of the farman of 1717 issued by Farrukhsiyar. The British, however, protected subjects of the Nawab, gave passes to native traders to trade custom-free and levied large duties on goods coming to their districts – actions which were detrimental to the Nawab&#x27;s revenue.

In April 1756, Alwardi Khan died and was succeeded by his twenty-three-year-old grandson, Siraj-ud-daulah. His personality was said to be a combination of a ferocious temper and a feeble understanding. He was particularly suspicious of the large profits made by the European companies in India. When the British and the French started improving their fortifications in anticipation of another war between them, he immediately ordered them to stop such activities as they had been done without permission. When the British refused to cease their constructions, the Nawab led a detachment of 3,000 men to surround the fort and factory of Cossimbazar and took several British officials as prisoners, before moving to Calcutta. The defences of Calcutta were weak and negligible. The garrison consisted of only 180 soldiers, 50 European volunteers, 60 European militia, 150 Armenian and Portuguese militia, 35 European artillery-men and 40 volunteers from ships and was pitted against the Nawab&#x27;s force of nearly 50,000 infantry and cavalry. The city was occupied on 16 June by Siraj&#x27;s force and the fort surrendered after a brief siege on 20 June.

The prisoners who were captured at the siege of Calcutta were transferred by Siraj to the care of the officers of his guard, who confined them to the common dungeon of Fort William known as The Black Hole. This dungeon, in size with two small windows and originally employed by the British to hold only six prisoners, had 146 prisoners thrust into it. On 21 June, the doors of the dungeon were opened and only 23 of the 146 walked out, the rest died of asphyxiation, heat exhaustion and delirium. It appears that the Nawab was unaware of the conditions in which his prisoners were held which resulted in the unfortunate deaths of most of the prisoners. Meanwhile, the Nawab&#x27;s army and navy were busy plundering the city of Calcutta and the other British factories in the surrounding areas.

When news of the fall of Calcutta broke in Madras on 16 August 1756, the Council immediately sent out an expeditionary force under Colonel Clive and Admiral Watson. A letter from the Council of Fort St. George, states that &quot;the object of the expedition was not merely to re-establish the British settlements in Bengal, but also to obtain ample recognition of the Company&#x27;s privileges and reparation for its losses&quot; without the risk of war. It also states that any signs of dissatisfaction and ambition among the Nawab&#x27;s subjects must be supported. Clive assumed command of the land forces, consisting of 900 Europeans and 1500 sepoys while Watson commanded a naval squadron. The fleet entered the Hooghly River in December and met with the fugitives of Calcutta and the surrounding areas, including the principal members of the council, at the village of Falta on 15 December. The members of council formed a Select Committee of direction. On 29 December, the force dislodged the enemy from the fort of Budge Budge. Clive and Watson then moved against Calcutta on 2 January 1757 and the garrison of 500 men surrendered after offering a scanty resistance. With Calcutta recaptured, the council was reinstated and a plan of action against the Nawab was prepared. The fortifications of Fort William were strengthened and a defensive position was prepared in the north-east of the city.

===Bengal campaign===
On 9 January 1757, a force of 650 men under Captain Coote and Major Kilpatrick stormed and sacked the town of Hooghly, north of Calcutta. On learning of this attack, the Nawab raised his army and marched on Calcutta, arriving with the main body on 3 February and encamping beyond the Maratha Ditch. Siraj set up his headquarters in Omichund&#x27;s garden. A small body of their army attacked the northern suburbs of the town but were beaten back by a detachment under Lieutenant Lebeaume placed there, returning with fifty prisoners.

Clive decided to launch a surprise attack on the Nawab&#x27;s camp on the morning of 4 February. At midnight, a force of 600 sailors, a battalion of 650 Europeans, 100 artillerymen, 800 sepoys and 6 six-pounders approached the Nawab&#x27;s camp. At 6:00, under the cover of a thick fog, the vanguard came upon the Nawab&#x27;s advanced guard, who after firing with their matchlocks and rockets, ran away. They continued forward for some distance until they were opposite Omichund&#x27;s garden, when they heard the galloping of cavalry on their right. The cavalry came within of the British force before the line gave fire, killing many and dispersing the rest. The fog hampered visibility beyond walking distance. Hence, the line moved slowly, infantry and artillery firing on either side randomly. Clive had intended to use a narrow raised causeway, south of the garden, to attack the Nawab&#x27;s quarters in the garden. The Nawab&#x27;s troops had barricaded the passage. At about 9:00, as the fog began to lift, the troops were overwhelmed by the discharge of two pieces of heavy cannon from across the Maratha Ditch by the Nawab&#x27;s artillery. The British troops were assailed on all sides by cavalry and musket-fire. The Nawab troops then made for a bridge a mile further on, crossed the Maratha Ditch and reached Calcutta. The total casualties of Clive&#x27;s force were 57 killed and 137 wounded. The Nawab&#x27;s army lost 22 officers of distinction, 600 common men, 4 elephants, 500 horses, some camels and a great number of bullocks. The attack scared the Nawab into concluding the Treaty of Alinagar with the Company on 9 February, agreeing to restore the Company&#x27;s factories, allow the fortification of Calcutta and restoring former privileges. The Nawab withdrew his army back to his capital, Murshidabad.

Concerned by the approach of de Bussy to Bengal and the Seven Years&#x27; War in Europe, the Company turned its attention to the French threat in Bengal. Clive planned to capture the French town of Chandannagar, north of Calcutta. Clive needed to know whose side the Nawab would intervene on if he attacked Chandannagar. The Nawab sent evasive replies and Clive construed this to be assent to the attack. Clive commenced hostilities on the town and fort of Chandannagar on 14 March. The French had set up defences on the roads leading to the fort and had sunk several ships in the river channel to prevent passage of the men of war. The garrison consisted of 600 Europeans and 300 sepoys. The French expected assistance from the Nawab&#x27;s forces from Hooghly, but the governor of Hooghly, Nandkumar had been bribed to remain inactive and prevent the Nawab&#x27;s reinforcement of Chandannagar. The fort was well-defended, but when Admiral Watson&#x27;s squadron forced the blockade in the channel on 23 March, a fierce cannonade ensued with aid from two batteries on the shore. The naval squadron suffered greatly due to musket-fire from the fort. At 9:00 on 24 March, a flag of truce was shown by the French and by 15:00, the capitulation concluded. After plundering Chandannagar, Clive decided to ignore his orders to return to Madras and remain in Bengal. He moved his army to the north of the town of Hooghly.

===Conspiracy===

The Nawab was infuriated on learning of the attack on Chandernagar. His former hatred of the British returned, but he now felt the need to strengthen himself by alliances against the British. The Nawab was plagued by fear of attack from the north by the Afghans under Ahmad Shah Durrani, as he had invaded Delhi, and was forced to send much of his men against him. Further threats from the west by the Marathas were also seen. Therefore, he could not deploy his entire force against the British for fear of being attacked from the flanks. A deep distrust set in between the British and the Nawab. As a result, Siraj started secret negotiations with Jean Law, chief of the French factory at Cossimbazar, and de Bussy. The Nawab also moved a large division of his army under Rai Durlabh to Plassey, on the island of Cossimbazar south of Murshidabad.

Popular discontent against the Nawab flourished in his own court. The Seths, the traders of Bengal, were in perpetual fear for their wealth under the reign of Siraj, contrary to the situation under Alivardi&#x27;s reign. They had engaged Yar Lutuf Khan to defend them in case they were threatened in any way. William Watts, the Company representative at the court of Siraj, informed Clive about a conspiracy at the court to overthrow the ruler. The conspirators included Mir Jafar, paymaster of the army, Rai Durlabh, Yar Lutuf Khan and Omichund, a merchant and several officers in the army. Invited by Mir Jafar to join the conspiracy, Clive referred the matter to a committee of senior Company officials. By 1 May, the committee passed a resolution in support of the alliance. A treaty was signed between the British and Mir Jafar agreeing, in return for substantial financial incentives, to help him overthrow the Nawab. According to historian W. Dalrymple, the Jagat Seths offered Clive and the East India Company more than £4m (£420m as of 2019), an additional 110,000 rupees a month (£1.43m as of 2019) to pay for Company troops, and other landholding rights. On 2 May, Clive broke up his camp and sent half the troops to Calcutta and the other half to Chandernagar.

Mir Jafar and the Seths desired that the confederacy between the British and himself be kept secret from Omichund, but when he found out about it, he threatened to betray the conspiracy if his share was not increased to three million rupees (£300,000, which would be over £3m in 2019). Hearing of this, Clive suggested an expedient to the committee. He suggested that two treaties be drawn – the real one on white paper, containing no reference to Omichund and the other on red paper, containing Omichund&#x27;s desired stipulation, to deceive him. The members of the committee signed on both treaties, but Admiral Watson signed only the real one and his signature had to be counterfeited on the fictitious one. Both treaties and separate articles for donations to the army, navy squadron and committee were signed by Mir Jafar on 4 June.

Clive testified and defended himself thus before the House of Commons of Parliament on 10 May 1773, during the Parliamentary inquiry into his conduct in India:

==Approach march==

On 12 June, Clive was joined by Major Kilpatrick with the rest of the army from Calcutta at Chandernagar. The combined force consisted of 613 Europeans, 171 artillerymen controlling eight field pieces and two howitzers, 91 topasses, 2100 sepoys (mainly dusadhs) and 150 sailors. The army set out for Murshidabad on 13 June. Clive sent out the Nawab&#x27;s messengers with a letter declaring his intention to march his army to Murshidabad to refer their complaints with regard to the treaty of 9 February with the principal officers of the Nawab&#x27;s government. The Indian troops marched on shore while the Europeans with the supplies and artillery were towed up the river in 200 boats. On 14 June, Clive sent a declaration of war to Siraj. On 15 June, after ordering an attack on Mir Jafar&#x27;s palace in suspicion of his alliance with the British, Siraj obtained a promise from Mir Jafar to not join the British in the field of battle. He then ordered his entire army to move to Plassey, but the troops refused to quit the city until the arrears of their pay were released. The delay caused the army to reach Plassey only by 21 June.

By 16 June, the British force had reached Paltee, north of which lay the strategically important town and fort of Katwa. It contained large stores of grain and military supplies and was covered by the river Aji. On 17 June, Clive despatched a force of 200 Europeans, 500 sepoys, one field piece and a small howitzer under Major Coote of the 39th Foot to capture the fort. The detachment found the town abandoned when they landed at midnight. At daybreak on 19 June, Major Coote went to the bank of the river and waved a white flag, but was met only by shot and a show of defiance by the governor. Coote split his Anglo-Indian force; the sepoys crossed the river and fired the ramparts while the Europeans crossed farther up from the fort. When the garrison saw the advancing troops, they gave up their posts and fled north. Hearing of the success, Clive and the rest of the army arrived at Katwa by the evening of 19 June.

At this juncture, Clive faced a dilemma. The Nawab had reconciled with Mir Jafar and had posted him on one flank of his army. Mir Jafar had sent messages to Clive, declaring his intention to uphold the treaty between them. Clive decided to refer the problem to his officers and held a council of war on 21 June. The question Clive put before them was whether, under the present circumstances, the army, without other assistance, should immediately cross into the island of Cossimbazar and attack the Nawab or whether they should fortify their position in Katwa and trust to assistance from the Marathas or other Indian powers. Of the twenty officers attending the council, thirteen including Clive were against immediate action, while the rest including Major Coote were in favour citing recent success and the high spirits of the troops. The council broke up and after an hour of deliberation, Clive gave the army orders to cross the Bhagirathi River (another name for the Hooghly River) on the morning of 22 June.

At 1:00, on 23 June, they reached their destination beyond the village of Plassey. They quickly occupied the adjoining mango grove, called Laksha Bagh, which was long and wide and enclosed by a ditch and a mud wall. Its length was angled diagonally to the Bhagirathi River. A little to the north of the grove at the bank of the river stood a hunting lodge enclosed by a masonry wall where Clive took up his quarters. The grove was about a mile from the Nawab&#x27;s entrenchments. The Nawab&#x27;s army had been in place 26 hours before Clive&#x27;s. A French detachment under Jean Law would reach Plassey in two days. Their army lay behind earthen entrenchments running at right angles to the river for and then turning to the north-eastern direction for . There was a redoubt mounted by cannon at this turning along the entrenchment. There was a small hill covered by trees east of the redoubt. towards the British position was a small tank (reservoir) and further south was a larger tank, both surrounded by a large mound of earth.

==Order of battle==

* British Forces
** 39th Regiment of Foot
** Bengal European Regiment
** The Madras Europeans
** Bombay Regiment
** 1st Bengal Native Infantry
** 1st Company, Bengal Artillery
** 6 × 6-pdr field cannons (50 × men), Royal Artillery

==Battle==

At daybreak on 23 June, the Nawab&#x27;s army emerged from their camp and started advancing towards the grove. Their army consisted of 30,000 infantry of all sorts, armed with matchlocks, swords, pikes and rockets and 20,000 cavalry, armed with swords or long spears, interspersed by 300 pieces of artillery, mostly 32, 24 and 18-pounders. The army also included a detachment of about 50 French artillerymen under de St. Frais directing their own field pieces. The French took up positions at the larger tank with four light pieces advanced by two larger pieces, within a mile of the grove. Behind them were a body of 5,000 cavalry and 7,000 infantries commanded by the Nawab&#x27;s faithful general Mir Madan Khan and Diwan Mohanlal. The rest of the army numbering 45,000 formed an arc from the small hill to a position east of the southern angle of the grove, threatening to surround Clive&#x27;s relatively smaller army. The right arm of their army was commanded by Rai Durlabh, the centre by Yar Lutuf Khan and the left arm closest to the British by Mir Jafar.

Clive watched the situation unfolding from the roof of the hunting lodge, anticipating news from Mir Jafar. He ordered his troops to advance from the grove and line up facing the larger tank. His army consisted of 750 European infantry with 100 Topasses, 2100 sepoys (dusadhs) and 100 artillerymen assisted by 50 sailors. The artillery consisted of eight 6-pounders and two howitzers. The Europeans and Topasses were placed in the centre of the line in four divisions, flanked on both sides by three 6-pounders. The sepoys were placed on the right and left in equal divisions. Clive posted two 6-pounders and two howitzers behind some brick-kilns north of the left division of his army to oppose the French fire.

===Battle begins===
At 8:00, the French artillery at the larger tank fired the first shot, killing one and wounding another from the grenadier company of the 39th Regiment. This as a signal, the rest of the Nawab&#x27;s artillery started a heavy and continuous fire. The advanced field pieces of the British opposed the French fire, while those with the battalion opposed the rest of the Nawab&#x27;s artillery. Their shots did not serve to immobilize the artillery but hit the infantry and cavalry divisions. By 8:30, the British had lost 10 Europeans and 20 sepoys. Leaving the advanced artillery at the brick kilns, Clive ordered the army to retreat back to relative shelter of the grove. The rate of casualties of the British dropped substantially due to the protection of the embankment.

===Death of Mir Madan Khan===

After three hours, there had been no substantial progress and the positions of both sides had not changed. Clive called a meeting of his staff to discuss the way ahead. It was concluded that the present position would be maintained till after nightfall, and an attack on the Nawab&#x27;s camp should be attempted at midnight. Soon after the conference, a heavy rainstorm occurred. The British used tarpaulins to protect their ammunition, while the Nawab&#x27;s army took no such precautions. As a result, their gunpowder got drenched and their rate of fire slackened, while Clive&#x27;s artillery kept up a continuous fire. As the rain began to subside, Mir Madan Khan, assuming that the British guns were rendered ineffective by the rain, led his cavalry to a charge. However, the British countered the charge with heavy grapeshot, mortally wounding Mir Madan Khan and driving back his men.

Siraj had remained in his tent throughout the cannonade surrounded by attendants and officers assuring him of victory. When he heard that Mir Madan was mortally wounded, he was deeply disturbed and attempted reconciliation with Mir Jafar, flinging his turban to the ground, entreating him to defend it. Mir Jafar promised his services but immediately sent word of this encounter to Clive, urging him to push forward. Following Mir Jafar&#x27;s exit from the Nawab&#x27;s tent, Rai Durlabh urged Siraj to withdraw his army behind the entrenchment and advised him to return to Murshidabad leaving the battle to his generals. Siraj complied with this advice and ordered the troops under Mohan Lal to retreat behind the entrenchment. He then mounted a camel and accompanied by 2,000 horsemen set out for Murshidabad.

===Battlefield manoeuvres===

At about 14:00, the Nawab&#x27;s army ceased the cannonade and began turning back north to their entrenchments, leaving St. Frais and his artillery without support. Seeing the Nawab&#x27;s forces retiring, Major Kilpatrick, who had been left in charge of the British force while Clive was resting in the hunting lodge, recognised the opportunity to cannonade the retiring enemy if St. Frais&#x27; position could be captured. Sending an officer to Clive to explain his actions, he took two companies of the 39th Regiment and two field pieces and advanced towards St. Frais&#x27; position. When Clive received the message, he hurried to the detachment and reprimanded Kilpatrick for his actions without orders and commanded to bring up the rest of the army from the grove. Clive himself then led the army against St. Frais&#x27; position which was taken at 15:00 when the French artillery retreated to the redoubt of the entrenchment, setting up for further action.

As the British force moved towards the larger tank, it was observed that the left arm of the Nawab&#x27;s army had lingered behind the rest. When the rear of this division reached a point in a line with the northern point of the grove, it turned left and marched towards the grove. Clive, unaware that it was Mir Jafar&#x27;s division, supposed that his baggage and stores were the intended target and sent three platoons under Captain Grant and Lieutenant Rumbold and a field piece under John Johnstone, a volunteer, to check their advance. The fire of the field piece halted the advance of the division, which remained isolated from the rest of the Nawab&#x27;s army.
Meanwhile, the British field pieces began a cannonade on the Nawab&#x27;s camp from the mound of the larger tank. As a result, many of the Nawab&#x27;s troops and artillery started coming out of the entrenchment. Clive advanced half of his troops and artillery to the smaller tank and the other half to a rising ground to the left of it and started bombarding the entrenchment with greater efficiency, throwing the approaching trains into confusion. The Nawab&#x27;s troops shot their matchlocks from holes, ditches, hollows and from bushes on the hill east of the redoubt while St. Frais kept up his artillery fire from the redoubt. Cavalry charges were also repulsed by the British field pieces. However, the British force sustained most of its casualties in this phase.

At this point, Clive realised that the lingering division was Mir Jafar&#x27;s and concentrated his efforts at capturing the redoubt and hill east of it. Clive ordered a three-pronged attack with simultaneous attacks by two detachments on the redoubt and the hill supported by the main force in the centre. Two companies of grenadiers of the 39th Regiment, under Major Coote took the hill at 16:30 after the enemy fled without firing a shot. Coote pursued them across the entrenchment. The redoubt was also taken after St. Frais was forced to retreat. By 17:00, the British occupied the entrenchment and the camp left by a dispersing army. The British troops marched on and halted beyond Daudpur at 20:00.

The British losses were estimated at 22 killed and 50 wounded. Of the killed, three were of the Madras Artillery, one of the Madras Regiment and one of the Bengal European Regiment. Of the wounded, four were of the 39th Regiment, three of the Madras Regiment, four of the Madras Artillery, two of the Bengal European Regiment, one of the Bengal Artillery and one of the Bombay Regiment. Of the losses by the sepoys, four Madras and nine Bengal sepoys were killed while nineteen Madras and eleven Bengal sepoys were wounded. Clive estimates that the Nawab&#x27;s force lost 500 men, including several key officers.

==Aftermath==
In the evening of 23 June, Clive received a letter from Mir Jafar asking for a meeting with him. Clive replied that he would meet Mir Jafar at Daudpur the next morning. When Mir Jafar arrived at the British camp at Daudpur in the morning, Clive embraced him and saluted him as the Nawab of Bengal, Bihar and Odisha. He then advised Mir Jafar to hasten to Murshidabad to prevent Siraj&#x27;s escape and the plunder of his treasure. Mir Jafar reached Murshidabad with his troops on the evening of 24 June. Clive arrived at Murshidabad on 29 June with a guard of 200 European soldiers and 300 sepoys in the wake of rumours of a possible attempt on his life. Clive was taken to the Nawab&#x27;s palace, where he was received by Mir Jafar and his officers. Clive placed Mir Jafar on the throne and acknowledging his position as Nawab, presented him with a plate of gold rupees.

Siraj-ud-daulah had reached Murshidabad at midnight on 23 June. He summoned a council where some advised him to surrender to the British, some to continue the war and some to prolong his flight. At 22:00 on 24 June, Siraj disguised himself and escaped northwards on a boat with his wife and valuable jewels. His intention was to escape to Patna with aid from Jean Law. At midnight on 24 June, Mir Jafar sent several parties in pursuit of Siraj. On 2 July, Siraj reached Rajmahal and took shelter in a deserted garden but was soon discovered and betrayed to the local military governor, the brother of Mir Jafar, by a man who was previously arrested and punished by Siraj. His fate could not be decided by a council headed by Mir Jafar and was handed over to Mir Jafar&#x27;s son, Miran, who had Siraj murdered that night. His remains were paraded on the streets of Murshidabad the next morning and were buried at the tomb of Alivardi Khan.

According to the treaty drawn between the British and Mir Jafar, the British acquired all the land within the Maratha Ditch and beyond it and the zamindari of all the land between Calcutta and the sea. Besides confirming the firman of 1717, the treaty also required the restitution, including donations to the navy squadron, army and committee, of 22,000,000 rupees (£2,750,000) to the British for their losses. However, since the wealth of Siraj-ud-daulah proved to be far less than expected, a council held with the Seths and Rai Durlabh on 29 June decided that one half of the amount was to be paid immediately – two-thirds in coin and one third in jewels and other valuables. As the council ended, it was revealed to Omichund that he would receive nothing with regard to the treaty, hearing which he went insane.

==Effects==
===Political effects===
As a result of the war of Plassey, the French were no longer a significant force in Bengal. In 1759, the British defeated a larger French garrison at Masulipatam, securing the Northern Circars. By 1759, Mir Jafar felt that his position as a subordinate to the British could not be tolerated. He started encouraging the Dutch to advance against the British and eject them from Bengal. In late 1759, the Dutch sent seven large ships and 1400 men from Java to Bengal under the pretext of reinforcing their Bengal settlement of Chinsura even though Britain and Holland were not officially at war. Clive, however, initiated immediate offensive operations by land and sea and defeated the much larger Dutch force on 25 November 1759 in the Battle of Chinsura. The British then deposed Mir Jafar and installed Mir Qasim as the Nawab of Bengal. The British were now the dominant European power in Bengal. When Clive returned to England due to ill health, he was rewarded with an Irish peerage, as Baron Clive of Plassey and also obtained a seat in the British House of Commons.

The struggle continued in areas of the Deccan and Hyderabad such as Arcot, Wandewash, Tanjore and Cuddalore, culminating in 1761 when Col. Eyre Coote defeated a French garrison under de Lally, supported by Hyder Ali at Pondicherry. The French were returned Pondicherry in 1763 by way of the Treaty of Paris but they never again regained their former stature in India. The British would, in effect, emerge as rulers of the subcontinent in subsequent years.

<text>An impresario (from Italian &quot;impresa&quot;, &#x27;an enterprise or undertaking&#x27;) is a person who organizes and often finances concerts, plays, or operas, performing a role in stage arts that is similar to that of a film or television producer.

==History==
The term originated in the social and economic world of Italian opera, in which from the mid-18th century to the 1830s, the impresario was the key figure in the organization of a lyric season. The owners of the theatre, usually amateurs from the nobility, charged the impresario with hiring a composer (until the 1850s operas were expected to be new) and the orchestra, singers, costumes and sets, all while assuming considerable financial risk. In 1786 Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart satirized the stress and emotional mayhem in a single-act farce &quot;Der Schauspieldirektor&quot; (&quot;The Impresario&quot;). Antonio Vivaldi was unusual in acting as both impresario and composer; in 1714 he managed seasons at Teatro San Angelo in Venice, where his opera &quot;Orlando finto pazzo&quot; was followed by numerous others.

Alessandro Lanari (1787–1852), who began as the owner of a shop that produced costumes, eliminated the middleman in a series of successful seasons he produced for the Teatro della Pergola in Florence. He presented the premieres of the first version of Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;, two of Vincenzo Bellini&#x27;s operas and five of Gaetano Donizetti&#x27;s, including &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;. Domenico Barbaia (1778–1841) began as a café waiter and made a fortune at La Scala, in Milan, where he was also in charge of the gambling operation and introduced roulette.

Duchess Elisabeth Sophie of Mecklenburg was a harpsichordist who also presided over seventeenth-century North German court music as an impresario.

==Modern use==
The traditional term is still used in the entertainment industry to refer to a producer of concerts, tours and other events in music, opera, theatre, and even rodeo. 

==Application of term==
The term is occasionally applied to others, such as independent art museum curators, event planners, and conference organizers who have a leading role in orchestrating events.

==Figurative impresarios==
Jacques Cousteau said of himself that he was an impresario of scientists as an explorer and filmmaker who worked with scientists in underwater exploration. Nicholas Wade described James Watson and E. O. Wilson in &quot;The New York Times&quot; as impresarios of Charles Darwin&#x27;s works.

<text>Geraldton (Wajarri: &quot;Jambinu&quot;, Wilunyu: &quot;Jambinbirri&quot;) is a coastal city in the Mid West region of Western Australia, north of the state capital, Perth.

As of the , Geraldton had an urban population of 38,595. Geraldton is the seat of government for the City of Greater Geraldton, which also incorporates the town of Mullewa, Walkaway and large rural areas previously forming the shires of Greenough and Mullewa.

The Port of Geraldton is a major west coast seaport. Geraldton is an important service and logistics centre for regional mining, fishing, wheat, sheep and tourism industries.

==History==

===Aboriginal===
Clear evidence has established Aboriginal people living on the west coast of Australia for at least 40,000 years, though at present it is unclear when the first Aboriginal people reached the area around Geraldton.

The original local Aboriginal people of Geraldton are the Amangu people, with the Nanda immediately to the north and Badimaya immediately to the east. Today the Aboriginal people of the region generally identify as Yamatji or Wajarri people. Wajarri country is inland from Geraldton and extends as far south and west as Mullewa, north to Gascoyne Junction and east to Meekatharra. The Aboriginal people of the Murchison-Gascoyne region were instrumental in assisting early settlers in the area in identifying permanent water sources, and worked in the pearling, pastoral and fishing industries.

Yamatji art is a distinctive style of painting, using thousands of dots of ochre and other earth-based pigments to create patterns and images relevant to Yamatji/Wajarri culture.

The Western Australia Museum at the marina in Geraldton hosts a permanent exhibit on Yamatji/Wajarri culture and history of the region.

===European arrival===
Many European mariners encountered, or were wrecked on, the Houtman Abrolhos islands west of Geraldton during the 17th and 18th centuries. Although two mutineers from the were marooned on the mainland in 1629 there is no surviving evidence that they made landfall at or near the site of the current town.

The wreck of the &quot;Batavia&quot;, flagship of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) fleet on her maiden voyage, on Morning Reef of the Houtman Abrolhos on 4 June 1629, and the events surrounding the subsequent mutiny, rescue and punishment of her crew are of great historical significance to the region. A detailed account of the events is recorded in a 24 December 1897 Western Mail article &quot;The Abrolhos Tragedy&quot;, translated from the notes of Francois Pelsaert, the commander of the &quot;Batavia&quot; when she ran aground. The Western Australian Museum in Geraldton houses an exhibition of clay pipes, silver coins, cannons, the original &quot;Batavia&quot; stone portico and numerous other relics recovered from the wreck of the &quot;Batavia&quot; and other notable local historical shipwrecks such as the , and .

The explorer George Grey, while on his second disastrous expedition along the Western Australian coast, passed over the future site of Geraldton on 7 April 1839. George Fletcher Moore, the colony&#x27;s attorney-general, on the colonial schooner &quot;Champion&quot;, explored the region in January 1840 and discovered Champion Bay. He was followed by Captain John Clements Wickham and Lieutenant John Lort Stokes of , who led an expedition to the area in April 1840, and named and surveyed Point Moore and Champion Bay.

A decade later, explorer Augustus Gregory travelled through the area. A member of his party, James Perry Walcott, discovered lead ore in 1848 in the bed of the Murchison River. The &quot;Geraldine&quot; mine was subsequently established, named after the County Clare family home of Charles FitzGerald, the 4th Governor of Western Australia. The town of Geraldton, named after Governor FitzGerald, was surveyed in 1850 and land sales began in 1851.

==Tourism==

===Visitor Centre===
The Geraldton Visitor Centre is located in the art gallery on 24 Chapman Road. 
Its former location was the original Railway Station, a historic building in Geraldton&#x27;s West End, and was originally built in 1878. It was the first railway station constructed on a Government line in Western Australia.

===Point Moore Lighthouse===
The Point Moore Lighthouse, located south of the Geraldton Port is a cultural and historical attraction. It is the oldest surviving Commonwealth lighthouse in Western Australia and was also the first steel tower to be constructed on the mainland of Australia. The Point Moore lighthouse stands 35m tall and its 1000w Tungsten Halogen Lamp can be seen for 23 nautical miles. It began operation in 1878. The tower was prefabricated in Birmingham, England in 1876 and reached Australia by boat in 1877. However, the foundation for the lighthouse was laid at the wrong place by the local contractors and had to be reconstructed at the new site. Currently, it is a heritage-listed structure which is visited by photographers, travellers, couples, artists, etc.

===Geraldton foreshore and city centre===
In 2007, the Geraldton foreshore area, previously an abandoned railway marshalling yard, was redeveloped and today hosts a playground with water activities, public green spaces, public beaches, picnic areas, basketball court and shaded play areas. The project was completed in 2008.

Geraldton is a regular port of call for cruise ships with visits occurring approximately ten times per year. Volunteers, organised by the City of Greater Geraldton, greet visitors on arrival to provide information on activities and other assistance.

===HMAS &quot;Sydney&quot; memorial===

The memorial for the World War II cruiser is located on Gummer Avenue, at the summit of Mount Scott. The memorial recognises the loss of the light cruiser during a mutually destructive fight with the German auxiliary cruiser &quot;Kormoran&quot; off Shark Bay in November 1941, with none of the 645 crewmen aboard surviving. A temporary memorial, consisting of a large boulder, a flagpole, and a bronze plaque, was erected in 1998. A permanent memorial was dedicated on 18 November 2001, the day before the 60th anniversary. The HMAS Sydney memorial is made up of four major elements: 1. A stele, based on the ships prow; 2. A granite wall listing the ships company; 3. A bronze statue of a woman looking out to sea and waiting in vain for &quot;Sydney&quot; to return; and 4. A dome made up of 645 stainless steel seagulls. The 645 stainless steel seagulls represent the souls of the lost sailors. In Folklore, birds such as seagulls are sometimes known as &#x27;soul birds&#x27; because they are regarded as the souls of people who died at sea. (Armstrong, 1958) &quot;Sydney&quot;
In May 2009, the memorial was recognised by the Australian government as being of national significance.

===Activities===

4WD access is permitted on many beaches around Geraldton. Many beaches are impassable at times around high tide and during periods of ocean surges. At certain times of year, access may become impossible due to beach erosion.

===Beaches===

The main beaches in Geraldton are Tarcoola Beach, Back Beach, Separation Point, Point Moore, Pages Beach, Town Beach, Champion Bay, St Georges, Sunset Beach and Bluff Point.

==Sport and recreation==
===Windsurfing and kitesurfing===
During the spring, summer and early autumn months from September through April, Geraldton experiences consistent seabreezes. Windsurfing and kitesurfing locations include Back Beach, Separation Point (&quot;Seppos&quot;), Point Moore, Hell&#x27;s Gate, St. George’s and Sunset Beach. The region is a popular windsurfing location, attracting significant numbers of overseas visitors and product testing by manufacturers. In 2005, Geraldton was host to the Australian KiteSurfing Association (AKSA) Australian National Championships.

===Surfing and stand-up paddlesurfing===

Surfing, and more recently Stand up paddle surfing, are also popular activities in and around Geraldton. Popular surf spots include Flat Rocks, Greenough, Back Beach, Sunset Beach and Glenfield. Stand-Up Paddlesurfing spots include Point Moore, Town Beach, The Foreshore, St. Georges Beach and Drummond Cove to the north.

In winter, local weather conditions shift to predominantly easterly (offshore) winds. Indian Ocean storms generate large swells that produce good conditions for surfing (though the fringe barrier reef protecting the Geraldton coastline blocks much of the swell, significantly reducing the size of the waves that reach the beaches). Large swells may create potentially dangerous rip currents as water flows through passages between the reef.

===Fishing, boating and sailing===
Saltwater fishing, boating and sailing are popular along Geraldton&#x27;s coastline.

Local and visiting recreational fishermen and women target a wide variety of native sport fish from the beaches and wharves that includes Mulloway, Bream, Tailor, Whiting, Sharks and Cod; larger fish such as Dhufish, Mackerel, Tuna, Snapper, Sampsonfish, Coral Trout and larger sharks, amongst many others are found on Geraldton&#x27;s offshore reefs, located from approximately 8 km to more than 80 km offshore. A recreational fishing licence is not required when fishing from the shore but a licence must be obtained from the Department of Fisheries to fish from a boat. Significant fines apply for non-compliance. Recreational fishing for local Western Rock Lobster is also permitted during the season from December–April (exact dates vary from year to year) however, a special licence is required. Size and daily bag limits apply to certain species of fish and to all lobster catches.

The city is home to the Geraldton Yacht Club, which marked its 100th anniversary in 2014.

===Scuba diving and snorkelling===
Scuba diving and snorkelling are popular activities around Geraldton. There are several wreck diving sites off the coast, including the &quot;South Tomi&quot;, which was sunk in 2004. The South Tomi is a 58.7-metre long, 9.81-metre wide vessel that was built by Niigata Engineering and Shipping Co Ltd. in Niigata City, Japan. In March 2001, the Republic of Togo registered South Tomi. The same month, the ship was identified fishing illegally in Australian sub-Antarctic waters and pursued by Australian Fisheries officers for 14 days, covering 3,300 nautical miles (approximately 6,100 kilometres). The vessel was boarded by Australian defence forces 320 nautical miles (approximately 600 km) south of Cape Town in South Africa and inspected. The vessel was found to be carrying an illegal catch of protected Patagonian toothfish and the vessel and its catch were confiscated by Australian authorities. The vessel was escorted 8,500 km to Western Australia and arrived on 5 May in Fremantle. The catch was sold by the Australian government for $1.4 million. The City of Geraldton secured the vessel to be sunk as an artificial reef. The ship was towed from Fremantle to Geraldton and scuttled on 18 September 2004 2.9 nautical miles off the Geraldton coast. The site is registered with the WA Department of Fisheries as a wreck and is closed year round to fishing within the defined boundaries – commencing at 28°43.968&#x27;S 114°33.392&#x27;E, then east to 114°33.206&#x27;E, then north to 28°43.752&#x27;S, then east to 114°33.392&#x27;E, then south to the commencement point. Water depth at the site is approximately 24.5 metres and the deck is 13 metres from the surface. The wreck of the South Tomi provides an easily accessible diving alternative to the nearby Houtman Abrolhos.

<text>Ibstone (previously Ipstone) is a village and civil parish in Buckinghamshire, England. The village is in the Chiltern Hills on the border with Oxfordshire, about south of Stokenchurch. The population of the parish at the 2011 Census was 242, an increase from 237 at the 2001 Census.

The village name is Anglo-Saxon in origin and means &#x27;Hibba&#x27;s boundary stone&#x27;, referring to the boundary with Oxfordshire. At the time of King Edward the Confessor the village was in the possession of Tovi, thane of the king, and was called &quot;Hibestanes&quot;.
The parish church, dedicated to Saint Nicholas, stands separate from the rest of the village; this is a common occurrence in places in this part of the country that had some standing in the pre-Roman Celtic period.

The village includes Cobstone Windmill. The windmill was built around 1816 and is unusual in that it is a twelve-sided smock mill, still housing some of its original machinery. It was converted into a residency during the 1950s and then refurbished after 1971. It was also used as Caractacus Potts&#x27; workshop in the 1968 film, &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; and seen in &quot;The New Avengers&quot; (TV series) episode, &quot;The House of Cards&quot;. The actress Hayley Mills and her film producer husband Roy Boulting owned the windmill and lived there in the early 1970s.

The politician Barbara Castle also lived in the village.

The common is an area of open access land and the standing stone (OS GR SU7507 9371) was erected for the Millennium -year 2000.

Ibstone is the name given to a hymn tune composed in 1875 by Maria C. Tiddeman (1837–1915), music professor in Oxford University.

<doc id="413073" wikidata="Q2276089" url="?curid=413073" title="Professional Footballers' Association">
<text>The Professional Footballers&#x27; Association (PFA) is the trade union for professional footballers in England and Wales.

Founded in 1907, it is the world&#x27;s oldest professional sports trade union, with approximately 5,000 current members each season, including players from the Premier League, EFL and Women&#x27;s Super League. Nearly 50,000 former members retain access to services and benefits including education grants, coaching courses and wellbeing support.

The PFA actively supports players with legal assistance, representation on contractual and disciplinary matters, and offers personal and professional development opportunities. The union also provides extensive mental and physical wellbeing support, and is committed to advocating for player rights at national and international levels. This includes taking legal action on issues such as player workload and pushing for equal representation and conditions in women&#x27;s football.

Current initiatives include the PFA Business School, which provides leadership training for players, and exclusive UEFA coaching programmes. The union also prioritises brain health through research and direct support for members dealing with neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, it runs rehabilitation programmes for injured players, pre-season camps for out-of-contract members, and ongoing aftercare support for former professionals transitioning into life after football.

The current CEO of the PFA is Maheta Molango, who took over in 2021, and the Players&#x27; Board, led by Leyton Orient&#x27;s Omar Beckles., represents member interests. The PFA&#x27;s leadership team is supported by an Operational Board of non-executive directors, which oversees governance.

==History==

===The Players&#x27; Union===

The PFA was formed on 2 December 1907 as the Association Football Players&#x27; and Trainers&#x27; Union (AFPTU; commonly referred to at the time as the Players&#x27; Union). On that date, Charlie Roberts and Billy Meredith (who had been involved in the AFU), both of Manchester United, convened the Players&#x27; Union at Manchester&#x27;s Imperial Hotel.

This was the second attempt to organise a union of professional footballers in England, after the Association Footballers&#x27; Union (the &quot;AFU&quot;), formed in 1898, had been dissolved in 1901. The AFU had failed in its objectives of bringing about a relaxation of the restrictions on the movement of players from one club to another in the Football League and preventing the introduction of a maximum wage of £4 per week for players in the Football League.

Like the AFU before it, the Players&#x27; Union intended to challenge the maximum wage and the restriction on transfers, in the form of the &quot;retain and transfer&quot; system.

===Threatened strike action in 1909===

When the Players&#x27; Union made its objectives clear in 1909, the Football Association withdrew its recognition of the Union, which at that time was seeking to join the U.K.&#x27;s General Federation of Trade Unions (&#x27;GFTU&#x27;).

In response, the Union threatened strike action. The Football Association in turn banned players affiliated with the AFPTU before the start of the 1909–10 season. The ban saw membership of the Union fall. However, players from Manchester United refused to relinquish their membership. League clubs turned to amateur players to replace players that had been banned, but Manchester United were not able to find enough replacements, risking the cancellation of their opening fixture at home to Bradford City. The Manchester United players were called &quot;Outcasts FC&quot;.

The deadlock swung in favour of the Union when Tim Coleman of Everton came out in support of the Union. Coleman&#x27;s intervention resuscitated support for the Union, which regained its strength of numbers. Agreement was reached on official recognition for the Union in exchange for allowing bonus payments to be made to players to supplement the maximum wage. The maximum wage remained for more than another half century.

===Continuing battles with the Football League===
The 1910s saw the Union backing a challenge by Herbert Kingaby against the retain and transfer system in the courts. Kingaby brought legal proceedings against his former employers, Aston Villa, for preventing him from playing. The Players&#x27; Union funded the proceedings. Erroneous strategy by Kingaby&#x27;s counsel resulted in the suit ending disastrously for the Union. The Union were almost ruined financially and membership fell drastically.

Although membership increased from 300 in 1915 to well over 1000 by 1920 this did not herald a new era of radicalism among the rank-and-file. Widespread unemployment heralded declines in attendance at Football League matches at a time when many clubs had, once again, committed themselves to expensive ground improvement programmes in the expectation that the post-war spectator boom would continue indefinitely. Inevitably, this caused financial difficulties at many clubs. Clubs believed their problems were due to players&#x27; excessive wages rather than over-expansion. In the spring of 1922, they persuaded the League authorities to arbitrarily impose a £1 cut to the maximum wage (£9 a week at that time) and force clubs to reduce the wages of players who were on less than the maximum. Legal proceedings backed by the Players&#x27; Union this time established that clubs could not unilaterally impose a cut in players&#x27; contracted wages.

Between 1946 and 1957 the Chairman of the Union was former Portsmouth captain Jimmy Guthrie. His book &quot;Soccer Rebel&quot;, published in 1976, documents his chairmanship and the struggle of the Union to improve the lot of professional footballers in the years preceding the abolition of the maximum wage.

In 1955, the union affiliated to the Trades Union Congress (TUC).

===Modernisation===

In 1956, Jimmy Hill became secretary of the Players&#x27; Union. He soon changed the union&#x27;s name to the Professional Footballers&#x27; Association (the &quot;PFA&quot;), changing a blue collar image to one in keeping with the new wave of working-class actors and entertainers.

In 1957, Jimmy Hill became chairman of the PFA and campaigned to have the Football League&#x27;s £20 maximum wage scrapped, which he achieved in January 1961. His Fulham teammate Johnny Haynes became the first £100 player.

The PFA also backed George Eastham in his legal action against the retain and transfer system, providing him with £15,000 to pay for his legal fees. The case was brought against his former club, Newcastle United, in the High Court. In 1963, The Court held that the retain and transfer system was an unreasonable restraint of trade.

From 1960, the union began representing trainers, and for a time was known as the &quot;Professional Footballers&#x27; and Trainers&#x27; Association&quot;.

The union decided to register under the Industrial Relations Act 1971, something the TUC opposed. As a result, it left the TUC in 1973, finally rejoining in 1995.

=== Centenary ===
2007 brought along the 100th year since the foundation of The Players Union, and to commemorate the centenary year, the PFA launched their &quot;One Goal One Million&quot; campaign. The campaign involved a whole year of celebratory fund-raising activities with the aim of raising £1 million to fully fund a new children&#x27;s rehabilitation and physiotherapy unit at the University Children&#x27;s Hospital, Manchester. Throughout the year the PFA ran a number of high-profile events involving current and former players and managers with the sole purpose of reaching the £1 million target. Events included a pro-celebrity golf event, race days and initiatives involving younger supporters. On the day that the PFA was formed in 1907 – 2 December – there was a match between an England Legends XI – captained by Alan Shearer and managed by Terry Venables – and a World Legends XI – captained by Gianfranco Zola and managed by Jürgen Klinsmann – culminating in a gala dinner in the evening involving a host of top entertainers.

In December of the centenary year, the PFA issued Fans&#x27; Favourites; a list of the favourite players at each Football League club. In making the selection, the PFA canvassed the opinions of the supporters of present, and some former, League clubs about their favourite player.

== Independent Review and Governance Restructure ==
In 2018, the Professional Footballers&#x27; Association (PFA) commissioned an Independent Review to enhance its governance, transparency, accountability, and independence, ensuring the PFA operates effectively and in the best interests of its members. The review was prompted by a dispute. over Ben Purkiss&#x27; eligibility as Chairman, and an open letter from 200 players calling for Chief Executive Gordon Taylor to stand down. In response, Taylor promised a full and open review of the union&#x27;s structure. At the 2018 AGM, held in Manchester in March 2019, it was agreed that Taylor, Purkiss, and the entire management committee would step down following the completion of the review. This extensive review concluded in July 2020 and outlined recommendations for the PFA&#x27;s future development.

Former England, Manchester United, and PFA Management Committee member Gary Neville was appointed to oversee the selection panel for the recruitment of four non-executive members, in line with the Independent Review Panel&#x27;s recommendations and supported by a specialist recruitment agency. This marked the first step towards implementing the recommendations and establishing a new governance structure. The structure includes an Operational Board and a Players’ Board. The Operational Board, responsible for overseeing day-to-day operations, consists of non-executive members, the CEO, and the Chair and Vice-Chair of the Players’ Board, with a non-executive member elected as chair. The Players&#x27; Board holds ultimate decision-making authority and delegates operational responsibilities to the Operational Board. It is directly representative of the union&#x27;s membership, with 13 members, including representatives from the Premier League, WSL, EFL Championship, League One, and League Two, along with three former players, at least two of whom have played professionally in the past five years.

Delegates approved the new rules at the AGM, which are now in effect. Following an open and competitive recruitment process, Maheta Molango was appointed as the new Chief Executive, leading the organisation through this period of change and development.

==PFA Awards==
In 1974, the PFA created three awards to be given to players – or people who have contributed a lot to the game – every year.
* Players&#x27; Player of the Year award: Given to the player voted the best of the season by his fellow players.
* Young Player of the Year award: Given to the young player voted the best of the season by the PFA.
* Merit Award: Given to the person who has contributed the most to football over the season, as voted for by the PFA.

In 1974 they introduced the first team based award:
* Team of the Year award: Given to eleven players in each league (forty-four players in total) who are deemed the best of the season by the PFA.

In 2001, they created another award:
* Fans&#x27; Player of the Year award: Given to the player voted the best of the season by the fans.

In 2013 and 2014 respectively, the PFA instituted the first female awards:
* PFA Women&#x27;s Players&#x27; Player of the Year award: Given to the female player voted the best of the season by her fellow players.
* PFA Young Women&#x27;s Player of the Year award: Given to the young female player voted the best of the season by the PFA.

At this time the &quot;PFA Player of the Year&quot; award was renamed &quot;Men&#x27;s PFA Player of the Year&quot; and the &quot;PFA Young Player of the Year&quot; was renamed &quot;Men&#x27;s PFA Young Player of the Year&quot;.

In 2020, the PFA added another award for the women:
* Fans&#x27; Women Player of the Year award: Given to the player voted the best of the WSL season by the fans.

== Sexism controversy ==
In 1997 some Sheffield United players invited their agent, Rachel Anderson, to the annual awards dinner. Anderson was turned away by then PFA Deputy Chief Executive Brendon Batson because she is a woman.

The following year, when West Ham United F.C. player Julian Dicks invited Anderson to attend the dinner, Anderson contacted the PFA to find out what their reaction would
be. On receiving a response that she would indeed be banned Anderson decided to go public and take
the PFA to court. As a result, the Minister for Sport, Tony Banks, and the Chief Executive of The Football Association, Graham Kelly boycotted the
event.

Anderson won in court and the financial cost to the PFA was considerable, Anderson suggests &quot;over £200,000&quot;, of which she received £7,500 for &quot;hurt feelings&quot; and an undisclosed amount for &quot;reasonable costs&quot;.

In 2013 the PFA instituted awards for the PFA Women&#x27;s Players&#x27; Player of the Year. Kim Little was the recipient in the first year.

==Current union objectives==
The PFA supports all current and former professional footballers in England across the Premier League, English Football League (EFL) and Women&#x27;s Super League (WSL).

Through its day-to-day work, the union directly supports players with legal assistance and representation on a wide range of football-related matters (e.g. contractual and disciplinary issues), provides personal and professional development opportunities, and offers mental and physical wellbeing support.  

The union also works with stakeholders and governing bodies at the national and international level to promote and protect players’ rights and conditions.

In June 2024, the PFA joined a legal action against FIFA over the &quot;overloaded and unworkable&quot; football match calendar which was presented before the Belgian courts. The PFA is a co-claimant in the case alongside the French players’ union (UNFP) and FIFPRO Europe.

In July 2024, the PFA also joined European Leagues and FIFPRO in a separate legal complaint to the European Commission over FIFA&#x27;s “abuse of dominance” in the game. Announcing the legal measures, PFA CEO Maheta Molango, who is also on the Board of FIFPRO Europe, said that “legal action is the unfortunate but inevitable consequence of major stakeholders in the game – the leagues and the players – being ignored.”

Molango has warned that players are willing to take direct action if demands are not listened to with regards to workload. He said: “We have reached a point where we cannot discount any action.&quot; Molango has said the football schedule is a health risk and is “killing the product.”

==== &quot;Women&#x27;s football&quot; ====
The PFA welcomed the Government&#x27;s review into women&#x27;s football led by Karen Carney, published in July 2023, which recommended that “comprehensive and formalised union representation for both Women&#x27;s Super League and Women&#x27;s Championship players.” At present the union does not receive direct funding from the FA towards its representation of professional players from the women&#x27;s game.

In December 2023, the PFA welcomed the Government&#x27;s backing of the Carney review&#x27;s recommendations. Molango said that “players will now rightly expect to see [the recommendations] acted on.”

The PFA is a member of the Women&#x27;s Football Review Implementation Group which was formed to “progress the review&#x27;s recommendations.”

PFA CEO Maheta Molango used an address to the TUC Congress in 2023 to ask Britain&#x27;s trade unions to support the call for “equal rights and conditions for female footballers.” The motion was backed by Lionesses Lucy Bronze and Katie Zelem, a member of the elected PFA Player&#x27;s Board.

=== Player guidance and representation ===

==== &quot;Legal guidance and support&quot; ====
All members of the PFA are entitled to receive contractual advice from the PFA. Under the standard playing contract, current players are also entitled to representation during general and field disciplinary appeals with the FA and with tribunals with the Premier League, EFL and WSL.

The PFA&#x27;s legal department oversees all governance and policy matters related to the union. Working alongside the Player Services division, it also provides members with advice on various legal issues in relation to all football matters. General Counsel James King, formerly part of the legal team at Arsenal FC, was appointed to lead the department in May 2022.

=== Professional and personal development ===

==== &quot;PFA Business School&quot; ====
In May 2023, the PFA launched the ‘PFA Business School’ to “develop the next generation of leaders in football management.” The school offers PFA members access to bespoke football-relevant courses, led by leaders from across football and sport. Degree and certificate qualifications are accredited by the University of Portsmouth.

In June 2024, the PFA Business School launched a first-of-its-kind undergraduate degree designed specifically for footballers. The course incorporates study for the UEFA B Coaching licence, the FA Talent ID &amp; Scouting Certificate, and preparation for the FIFA Agent Licence. Arsenal, Chelsea, Newcastle United, West Ham United, Brighton, Crystal Palace, Wolves and Watford signed a partnership with the PFA to co-fund player participation in the programme.

Former Arsenal manager and FIFA&#x27;s Chief of Global Football Development is overseeing the course as Course Director. Players Jordan Henderson, Phil Jones, Lucy Staniforth and İlkay Gündoğan have studied with the PFA Business School.

==== &quot;Coaching and officiating&quot; ====
The PFA delivers exclusive, subsidised courses to help current and former professional players gain UEFA coaching badges. The courses are led by the PFA&#x27;s in-house team of coach developers, led by Head of Coach Development and former Lioness Lousie Newstead, who was appointed in April 2024.

Granit Xhaka, Jermain Defoe, Mohamed Elneny and Colin Kazim-Richards are among the former Premier League players to have undertaken their UEFA coaching badges with the PFA.

In May 2024, the PFA, FA and UEFA announced the first-ever all-female cohort of students for the UEFA A Licence course. The course consists of 17 current and former professional players, including Steph Houghton, Aoife Mannion, Kim Little, Beth Mead and Karen Bardsley.

The PFA Coach Development department co-runs the Professional Player to Coach Scheme (PPCS) alongside the Premier League and EFL. The scheme is designed to increase the number of Black, South Asian and Minority Ethnic players who transition into full-time coaching roles in the professional game.

In June 2024, the PFA announced a partnership with PGMOL (Professional Game Match Officials Limited) to create a new programme offering current and former players the chance to explore a career in refereeing.

==== &quot;Personal Development&quot; ====
The union&#x27;s Personal Development department provides current and former members with access to career advice and skills development opportunities. The department provides members to career advice, professional development guidance and access to funding to pursue courses and academic or vocational qualifications.

Former Brighton and Chelsea manager Graham Potter completed a PFA-funded Social Sciences degree from the Open University.

=== Mental and physical wellbeing ===

==== &quot;Wellbeing&quot; ====
The PFA&#x27;s Wellbeing department provides the union&#x27;s members – past and present – with tailored support around all aspects of mental health and behavioural challenges. The department offers direct support to players and clubs, as well as via partners at the Sporting Chance clinic, which provides mental health support specifically for professional sportspeople.    

Members can access a specialised network of over 200 therapeutic counsellors, a 24/7 helpline which puts players in direct contact with a counsellor, and residential care is also accessible for members with particular behavioural or addiction challenges.

Led by psychotherapist and former professional player Dr Michael Bennett, the department conducts tailored workshops to clubs across the Premier League, EFL and WSL. These workshops focus on holistic wellbeing, as well as issues specific to footballers and their working environments.

Confidential data collected during visits to clubs is used to track and highlight wellbeing issues for players in the professional game. In November 2023, the PFA highlighted that anxiety and online abuse were prevalent issues for its members.

In May 2024, the PFA and Loughborough University published findings from a joint study into snus use among professional footballers. The project was commissioned by the union the year prior to explore the usage and perceived health and performance effects of snus use among players.

==== &quot;Brain Health&quot; ====
The PFA&#x27;s Brain Health division leads the union&#x27;s work around educating and supporting current and former members on all things related to their brain health. The union states that its work is focused on two areas: “developing a culture of positive brain health for players across football”, and “enhancing the quality of life for players living with neurodegenerative disease.”

The department is led by Dr Adam White, an interdisciplinary researcher crossing sport, medicine and health and the co-founder of the Concussion Legacy Foundation.

The union conducts year-round workshops in clubs, educating players and staff coaches on associated risks, relevant guidelines and the need to protect the brain health of players during training and matches.

The department funds and promotes academic research focused on improving current and former players brain health, including brain donation. The PFA has co-funded two studies, FIELD and FOCUS, to help advance understandings of dementia amongst former professional footballers.

In September 2023, the PFA and Premier League launched the Football Brain Health Fund. The fund was established with an initial allocation of £1 million to provide financial support to former players and their families affected by dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases. The union&#x27;s CEO, Maheta Molango, has said there needs to be a “football-wide responsibility” in supporting former players with neurodegenerative disease.

The PFA&#x27;s Brain Health division provides guidance and support for players and families suffering with neurodegenerative disease, including free access to Admiral Nurses specialising in dementia care. Dawn Astle and Rachel Walden, daughters of Jeff Astle and Rod Taylor respectively, joined the union in 2021 to support the union&#x27;s care provision for members.  

The PFA and FA co-fund the Advanced BRAIN Health Clinic. Located at the Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health (ISEH) in central London, the clinic provides confidential and specialist neurological assessments to mid-life retired male and female professional footballers.

==== &quot;Rehabilitation support&quot; ====
The PFA provides players with free, residential rehabilitation support at St George&#x27;s park. Delivered in partnership with Game Changer Performance (GCP), the scheme is designed to help members overcome injury and safely return to playing.

=== Aftercare for former professional players ===

==== &quot;The After Academy&quot; ====
In April 2024, the PFA was confirmed as a supporting partner to Trent Alexander Arnold&#x27;s &#x27;The After Academy&#x27; project. The initiative provides career opportunities for former academy players who wish to forge new career paths outside of professional football.

The union hosts the scheme&#x27;s job board which was launched in February 2024 and is the main access point to view and apply for job listings.

Alexander-Arnold said: “I&#x27;m proud of this programme as it looks to give another chance to those who didn&#x27;t make it, and I hope it is just a first step towards a brighter future for these young players.”

==== &quot;RECONNECT&quot; ====
In April 2024, the PFA launched RECONNECT – a nationwide fitness network available to retired PFA members and aimed at helping ex-professional players manage the physical and mental transition away from playing full-time.

The scheme was backed by Leicester City&#x27;s 2016 Premier League title-winning captain West Morgan. The network is part of a wider PFA effort to help members during and after their playing careers.

PFA CEO Maheta Molango said: “The physical impact of moving away from full-time football is often overlooked, but it can have big knock-on effects at what is often a really challenging time for players.”

Monthly sessions take place at Cardiff Metropolitan University, Liverpool John Moores University, Leeds Beckett University, Hull University, Loughborough University, University College Birmingham, University of East Anglia, among others.

=== Pre-season support for out-of-contract players ===

==== &quot;PFA pre-season&quot; ====
To support out-of-contract players during the off-season, in May 2024 the union announced the introduction of  ‘PFA pre-season’, a 10-week residential training camp for PFA members. The scheme followed a successful two-week pilot hosted the year prior.

‘PFA pre-season’ was made available to PFA members who were under professional contracts over the 2023/24 season.

Each week-long camp provided members with a full pre-season training schedule, including on-pitch training and fixtures, strength and conditioning as well as rehabilitation and recovery sessions. The camp was hosted at Champney Springs in Leicestershire with players’ accommodation, nutrition and kit all provided by the union.

The scheme was backed by Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe: “There are a lot of players who will really benefit from this as a way of giving them the best chance of staying ready for when the next opportunity comes.”

In 2024, the camp was attended by players including Dwight Gayle, Ciaran Clark, Aiden O’Brien, Omar Bogle, and Asmir Begovic. Clark said: “You can see how much it helps the lads. It&#x27;s massive really, physically and mentally. Being around the lads and the coaches, getting your training sessions in, eating together. It&#x27;s all the lads know really.”

The initiative was introduced following a recommendation from the PFA Players’ Board, an elected leadership group of current and former players which helps set the direction of the union.

<text>Ickford is a village and civil parish in the unitary authority area of Buckinghamshire, England. It is on the boundary with Oxfordshire, about west of the market town of Thame.

The River Thame forms both the southern boundary of the parish and Ickford&#x27;s part of the county boundary with Oxfordshire. A stream that is a tributary of the Thame bounds the parish to the west and north.

==Toponym==
The village toponym is derived from Old English meaning &quot;Icca&#x27;s ford&quot;. The Domesday Book of 1086 records it as &quot;Iforde&quot;. From the 12th to the 14th centuries it evolved through &quot;Ycford&quot;, &quot;Hicford&quot;, &quot;Hitford&quot;, &quot;Ikeford&quot; and &quot;Ickeforde&quot; before later reaching its present form.

==Manors==
The Domesday Book records that Miles Crispin held four hides of land at Ickford. Crispin was linked with Wallingford Castle, and through him the manor of Ickford became part of the Honour of Wallingford. In the 13th century the Appleton family were the lower lords of this manor. It is not recorded who held this manor before the Norman Conquest of England.

It is recorded that before the Conquest a second manor at Ickford was held by Ulf, a man of Harold Godwinson. The Domesday Book records Robert, Count of Mortain as holding this second manor, with the Benedictine Grestain Abbey as his mesne lord. By 1359 Wilmington Priory in Sussex, an English cell of the abbey, was the mesne lord. By 1377 William de Montacute, 2nd Earl of Salisbury, who had succeeded to some of the de Mortain lands, was Ickford&#x27;s overlord.

Towards the end of the 12th century Bartholomew de Ickford was the lower lord of one of Ickford&#x27;s manors, apparently that belonging to Grestain Abbey. By the time his great-grandson John held the manor in 1302–03, the family carried the surname &quot;atte Water&quot;. William atte Water died in 1313, by which time the family held both manors and they seem to have been merged.
Members of the Appleton and Ickford families granted lands at Ickford to Godstow Abbey in Oxfordshire and the Priory of St Frideswide, Oxford. In the 14th century the atte Water family gave land to Bisham Priory in Berkshire. Bradwell Priory also claimed the atte Waters had granted it land at Ickford. In the 16th century the Bisham Priory lands passed to Thomas Tipping, who from 1585 held the &quot;manors of Great and Little Ickford&quot;. He died in either 1595 or 1601 and is commemorated by a large monument in the parish church. Thomas&#x27;s great-grandson Sir Thomas Tipping, who inherited the estate in 1627, was a moderate Parliamentarian in the English Civil War. His son, also Thomas Tipping, inherited the estate in 1693 and was created a baronet in 1698. In 1703 he obtained an Act of Parliament that allowed him to sell the estate.

In Little Ickford, Manor Farm or the New Manor House is a timber-framed building with a 16th-century south range and a 17th-century north block and staircase. The walls of one of the ground floor rooms in the north block has late-17th-century decorative painting now largely concealed behind early-18th-century panelling. The house is a Grade II* listed building.

==Parish church==


The Church of England parish church of Saint Nicholas dates from the late 12th or early 13th century. The nave was built in about AD 1210, with a porch in the middle of the south side. Relatively narrow three-bay north and south aisles were added in about 1230, with the south aisle absorbing the original porch and taking the porch&#x27;s south wall for the limit of its width. The north aisle has one Norman and Early English Gothic 13th-century lancet windows, one of which has a later rere-arch with cusped spandrels, each with a carved rosette.

The chancel has two 13th-century lancet windows in its north wall. Near the westerly of these windows is a rectangular recess that may have been a squint. In its south wall are another lancet window and a 13th-century doorway. The Decorated Gothic east window is 14th-century and has reticulated tracery with ogees. The south wall of the chancel has at its east end a window from about 1350 that is said to have been brought from elsewhere, and towards the west end a 15th-century window with a depressed head. Some of the stained glass windows are 20th-century work by Ninian Comper.

The bell tower is substantially Norman but the upper stages were remodelled in the 14th century. The tower has a saddleback roof.

In the nave some of the seats are 16th-century and there is a west gallery fronted with 17th-century panelling. The pulpit and its tester are also 17th-century.

Restoration work was carried out on the building in 1856, 1875 and 1907. The large stone monument to the first Thomas Tipping used to be in the north aisle, but in 1906 was moved to its present position in the chancel. St. Nicholas&#x27; is a Grade I listed building.

The west tower has three bells. The treble was cast in about 1599, possibly by George Appowell of Buckingham. Ellis I Knight of Reading, Berkshire cast the tenor in 1623. George Chandler of Drayton Parslow cast the youngest of the main bells in 1716. There is also a Sanctus bell, cast by William Taylor&#x27;s Oxford foundry in 1847.

The Puritan minister Calybute Downing held the living of the parish from 1632 but it was then conferred on Gilbert Sheldon in 1636. Sheldon already held the living of Hackney, received that of Oddington, Oxfordshire at about the same time as Ickford, and at some time also that of Newington, Oxfordshire. After the Restoration of the Monarchy, Sheldon was consecrated Archbishop of Canterbury in 1663. St. Nicholas&#x27; is now part of the Benefice of Worminghall with Ickford, Oakley and Shabbington.

==Economic and social history==

Ickford had a bridge over the River Thame by 1237, when repairs were ordered with oak from Brill Wood. In that century the bridge was variously recorded as &quot;Wodebrugge&quot; or &quot;Widebrugge&quot;. County boundary stones set into the present bridge of three stone arches suggest that it was completed in 1685. The bridge is a scheduled monument.

The recusant dramatic poet William Joyner lived at Ickford in the 17th century.

The village hall was designed by the architects Dale and Son of Oxford and built in 1946. The building is of five bays separated by arches vaulting from the floor. Its extensive roof and almost all of its walls are hung with wooden shingles, possibly in response to the shortage of many types of building material after the Second World War. The hall was built entirely by a small party of volunteers from the parish: an achievement commemorated by a painting over the fireplace in the hall.

==Amenities==


Ickford has a 15th-century public house, the Rising Sun. A second pub, the Royal Oak, ceased trading in about 2000. Ickford has also a village shop and post office.

Ickford Combined School is a community primary school for children between four and eleven years old and has about 115 pupils. The school also serves the adjoining parishes of Worminghall and Shabbington. The school was opened in September 1906 and has a sports hall, which was opened in February 2006. There is a pre-school and an After School Club at the school.

Much of the parish is agricultural but being close to Oxford and junction 8A of the M40 Ickford is increasingly a commuter village.

For more than 60 years an annual tug of war with neighbouring Tiddington has been held each summer across the River Thame.

<text>Ilmer is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Longwick-cum-Ilmer, in Buckinghamshire, England. It is at the foot of the Chiltern Hills about northwest of Princes Risborough, near the boundary with Oxfordshire. In 1931 the parish had a population of 40. On 1 April 1934 the parish was abolished to form &quot;Longwick cum Ilmer&quot;.

==Toponym==
The village toponym is derived from the Old English for &#x27;Ylla&#x27;s boundary&#x27;, referring to the ancient boundary with Oxfordshire. The Domesday Book of 1086 records the village as &quot;Imere&quot;.

==Parish church==
The nave of the Church of England parish church of Saint Peter dates from the 12th century. In the 14th century the chancel was rebuilt and a south transept was added to the nave. In the 16th century the timber-framed and weatherboarded bellcote was added to the west end of the building. In 1662 the south transept was demolished. The building was restored in 1859–60 under the direction of the Oxford Diocesan architect, G.E. Street.

The bellcote has three bells, all of them cast by bellfounders from Reading, Berkshire. The tenor was cast in about 1500, probably by William Hasylwood. William Knight cast the second bell in 1568 and Henry Knight cast the treble in 1618.

St Peter&#x27;s is a Grade II* listed building.

==Railway history==
In 1899–1905 the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway was built through the parish. In 1906 was opened on the line to serve the village. British Railways closed the halt in 1963. The railway remains open as part of the Chiltern Main Line from London. 

In 1968, a scene from Albert R. Broccoli&#x27;s &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; was filmed along the railway line in which the Baron Bomburst&#x27;s spies capture the wrong car with Lord Scrumptious inside.

<text>Julian Randolph Stow (28 November 1935 – 29 May 2010) was an Australian-born writer, novelist and poet.

==Early life==
Born in Geraldton, Western Australia, Randolph Stow was the son of Mary Campbell Stow née Sewell and Cedric Ernest Stow, a lawyer.

Stow attended Geraldton Primary and High schools, Guildford Grammar School, the University of Western Australia, and the University of Sydney. During his undergraduate years in Western Australia he wrote two novels and a collection of poetry, which were published in London by Macdonald &amp; Co. He taught English literature at the University of Adelaide, the University of Western Australia and the University of Leeds.

==Career==
He also worked on an Aboriginal mission in the Kimberley, which he used as background for his third novel &quot;To the Islands&quot;. Stow further worked as an assistant to an anthropologist, Charles Julius, and as a cadet patrol officer in the Trobriand Islands off the east coast of New Guinea. In the Trobriands he suffered a mental and physical breakdown that led to his repatriation to Australia. Twenty years later, he used these last experiences in his novel &quot;Visitants&quot;.

Stow first visited England in 1960 and lived there for a few years, although he returned several times to Australia. &quot;Tourmaline&quot;, his fourth novel, was completed in 1962 while he taught in Leeds. In 1964 and 1965 he travelled in North America on a Harkness Fellowship, including a sojourn in Aztec, New Mexico, during which he wrote one of his best known novels, &quot;The Merry-Go-Round in the Sea&quot;. While living in Perth (WA) in 1966 he wrote his popular children&#x27;s book &quot;Midnite&quot;.

From 1969 to 1981 he lived at East Bergholt in Suffolk in England, his ancestral county, and he used traditional tales from that area to inform his novel &quot;The Girl Green as Elderflower&quot;. The last decades of his life he spent in nearby Harwich, the setting for his final novel &quot;The Suburbs of Hell&quot;. He last visited Australia in 1974.

Stow died in England on 29 May 2010 of a pulmonary embolism, having been diagnosed with liver cancer.

== &quot;The Girl Green as Elderflower&quot; (1980) ==
&quot;The Girl Green as Elderflower&quot; is often considered to be closely linked to Stow&#x27;s life. After dealing with a bout of malaria in Papua New Guinea, he moved to East Bergholt in Suffolk in England from 1969 to 1981, his ancestral county, and he used traditional tales from that area, many of which he translated from Latin himself, to inform his novel. The regional stories Stow used for the novel were collected by William of Newburgh, Gervase of Tilbury, Gerald the Welshman, Ralph Coggeshall, Roger Howden, and Walter Map. Many of the characters in the novel are based on Stow&#x27;s friends. He conducted research in advance of publication for several years. In 1978, he and John Constable&#x27;s great-great-grandson were in a serious car accident, which finally spurred Stow to begin writing the novel. On New Year&#x27;s Day 1979, he began writing and finished thirty-two days later.

Stow was influenced by the focus on particular places in English Victorian literature and set the entire novel in Suffolk. Literary scholar Melanie Duckworth has claimed that, in &quot;The Girl Green as Elderflower,&quot; Suffolk is not mere setting, but rather a textured and historied place. Although he kept the location static, the novel takes place over a variety of time periods. It focuses one place throughout and across time. Stow engages in what Duckworth calls &quot;Australian medievalism,&quot; drawing connections between the Middle Ages and postcolonial Australia and Papua New Guinea. This connection is most clear between the medieval legend of green children and the novel&#x27;s titular Welsh &quot;girl green.&quot; Stow draws a parallel between greenness and strangeness in the medieval period to the aftermath of contemporary colonial projects. Ultimately, according to Duckworth, it is trauma (both for the main character, Crispin Clare, and the colonial/postcolonial places he inhabits) that draws the narrative out of and across time. Destabilization of time is positioned as a means of recovery, particularly for Clare.

In March 2019, La Mama Courthouse Theatre in Melbourne, Australia adapted &quot;The Girl Green as Elderflower&quot; into a musical. It was adapted by Richard Davies and directed and orchestrated by Sara Grenfell.

==Awards and legacy==
His novel &quot;To the Islands&quot; won the Miles Franklin Award for 1958. He was awarded the Patrick White Award in 1979. As well as producing fiction, poetry, and numerous book reviews for &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, he also wrote libretti for musical theatre works by Peter Maxwell Davies.

A considerable number of Randolph Stow&#x27;s poems are listed in the State Library of Western Australia online catalogue with indications where they have been anthologised.

==Personal life and family==
Julian Randolph Stow&#x27;s paternal grandfather was Francis Leslie Stow, a Crown Solicitor of Western Australia. Stow&#x27;s great-grandfather was Randolph Isham Stow, a judge on the Supreme Court of South Australia and Attorney-General of South Australia; a great-great-uncle, Jefferson Stow was prominent as an explorer of northern Australia, and Stow&#x27;s great-great-grandfather, the Rev. Thomas Quinton Stow, was a pioneering Congregational minister in South Australia. The Stow family was from Suffolk, where they had owned land for several generations before Thomas Stow was appointed the colonial missionary to South Australia by the London Colonial Missionary Society in 1836. In 1837, they relocated to South Australia. After Thomas Stow&#x27;s death, the Stow Memorial Church was constructed in his honor. His wife, Elizabeth Randolph Eppes, was American and her mother was Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s first cousin. The Stow lineage can be traced back to the Plantagenets and William the Conqueror.

Stow&#x27;s mother&#x27;s family settled in Australia in the 1830s and were some of the earliest to arrive. His great-grandfather, George Sewell, arrived in Australia in 1835; soon after, the rest of his family relocated from Essex to Australia. Sewell eventually moved from Perth to Geraldton, where his descendants remained. Stow grew up very interested in the traditional stories and histories of the region.

A deeply private person, Stow&#x27;s life was dogged at times by loneliness and depression (including two suicide attempts), probable alcoholism, an addiction to prescription drugs, and a struggle to come to terms with his homosexuality in a time when it was oppressed.

<text>The Peerage of the United Kingdom is one of the five peerages in the United Kingdom. It comprises most peerages created in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland after the Acts of Union in 1801, when it replaced the Peerage of Great Britain. New peers continued to be created in the Peerage of Ireland until 1898 (the last creation was the Barony of Curzon of Kedleston)

The House of Lords Act 1999 reformed the House of Lords. Until then, all peers of the United Kingdom were automatically members of the House of Lords. However, from that date, most of the hereditary peers ceased to be members, whereas the life peers retained their seats. All hereditary peers of the first creation (i.e. those for whom a peerage was originally created, as opposed to those who inherited a peerage), and all surviving hereditary peers who had served as Leader of the House of Lords, were offered a life peerage to allow them to continue to sit in the House, should they wish.

Peers in the Peerage of Scotland and Peerage of Ireland did not have an automatic seat in the House of Lords following the Acts of Union of 1707 and 1800, though the law permitted a limited number to be elected by their fellows to serve in the House of Lords as representative peers. Some peerages of the United Kingdom were created to get around this obstacle and allow certain Scottish and Irish peers to enjoy the automatic right to sit in the House of Lords

==Key==
==Ranks==
The ranks of the peerage are duke, marquess, earl, viscount, and baron.

The last non-royal dukedom was created in 1874, and the last marquessate was created in 1936. Creation of the remaining ranks, except baronies for life, mostly ceased once Harold Wilson&#x27;s Labour government took office in 1964, and only thirteen (nine non-royal and four royal) people have been created hereditary peers since then. These were:
==Dukes in the Peerage of the United Kingdom==

==Titles==

Marquesses, earls, viscounts and barons are all addressed as &#x27;Lord X&#x27;, where &#x27;X&#x27; represents either their territory or surname pertaining to their title. Marchionesses, countesses, viscountesses and baronesses are all addressed as &#x27;Lady X&#x27;. Dukes and duchesses are addressed just as &#x27;Duke&#x27; or &#x27;Duchess&#x27; or, in a non-social context, &#x27;Your Grace&#x27;

<text>Nina de Vries (born 21 January 1961 in IJmuiden, the Netherlands) is a Dutch sexual assistant who has lived and worked in Germany since 1990. She distinguishes between &quot;Sexual Assistance&quot; and &quot;Surrogate Partnership&quot;, terms which are commonly used interchangeably. Over the years her focus has shifted to the work with severely disabled people as well as the education and training of sexual assistants. In addition, she is responsible for elderly care facilities and facilities in which people with different kinds of impairments have found a new home.

==Education and early work==
Nina de Vries is a child of politically engaged parents. Already at an early age she was familiar with the concept of Amnesty International and Protests against the Vietnam War. Her father was a teacher, her mother a housewife. Her mother took her own life when de Vries was 16 years old –  a &quot;moment that markedly shaped the path of her life.&quot; When she was 17 years old and feeling vulnerable after her mother&#x27;s death, she saw a report on Dutch television about so-called &quot;sex helpers&quot;. Deeply touched, it reminded her of &quot;clown doctors&quot; who try to bring some joy to dying children. She did not know that this encounter with people who fearlessly face the hopelessness and despair of other human beings would become an impetus for her, and that she would become a fighter for the sexual self-determination of those who can not help themselves.

Nina de Vries attended primary school in Amersfoort. She graduated from high school in Arnheim in 1979 and then studied social work in Leeuwarden. For several years she lived and worked in a Buddhist-oriented community, but later distanced herself from this spirituality. However, Buddhist elements continue to flow into her work. While still in the Netherlands, she trained in bodywork and sexual education.

In 1990 Nina de Vries moved to Berlin and later to Potsdam where she has been living and working, unless her expertise is in demand elsewhere. Initially she was active artistically, engaging in graphic arts and sculpture, among other areas. In 1992 she began working as an educator in a rehabilitation center where she worked for a year. This brought her into contact with disabled people for the first time. In January 2017 she gave an interview about her work in English.

==Career==
Nina de Vries is considered a &quot;pioneer of sexual assistance&quot;. At the end of the 1990s she began her work as a sexual assistant and has continued to gain expertise since then. She sees her most important teachers as those who use her services.

Currently de Vries&#x27; clients are primarily people with multiple disabilities, with autism as well as persons who have significant cognitive or dementia disorders. In addition, de Vries is engaged in training others to achieve quality standards. She believes that flexibility, sensitivity, respect and truthfulness are indispensable values in her work. Furthermore, on behalf of the &quot;Center for Disability and Sexuality&quot; (German: &quot;Fachstelle für Behinderung und Sexualität, FABS)&quot; in Basel, she trained ten sex therapists of both genders for six months. She also offers coaching to organizations dedicated to the sexual self-determination of people.

De Vries is regularly asked by various institutions to give lectures or workshops on the topics of &quot;Sexuality and Disability&quot; or &quot;Sexuality and Aging&quot;. Research associations are involved, as are facilities for disabled people, and nursing homes which are beginning to approach this largely taboo subject. Requests for her expertise come mostly from Germany, Austria and Switzerland. At the 4th Congress for the &quot;Care of the Elderly&quot; in 2010, she gave an interview which is available on YouTube.

When De Vries began to work in the field of &quot;Sexual Assistance and Education&quot; she was &quot;surprised&quot; by the response in Germany as she knew that &quot;in the Netherlands there is more open-mindedness. &#x27;Sex Helpers&#x27; have been active there since the seventies. Here it is taboo until today.&quot; In Germany, as opposed to the Netherlands, &quot;very few questions are being asked&quot;. This is beginning to change. The Federal Centre for Health Education (BZgA) is funding a research project led by Sven Jennessen of the University of Koblenz-Landau in cooperation with the &quot;Catholic University of North Rhine-Westphalia&quot; (German: &quot;Katholische Hochschule Nordrhein-Westphalen&quot;) and the &quot;Protestant University of Applied Sciencices&quot; (German: &quot;Evangelische Hochschule Bochum&quot;) in Bochum to examine the question &quot;how disabled people in facilities can express their sexual self-determination&quot;.

==Sexual assistance==
The attempt to provide assistance to people who need specific help with their sexuality due to various impairments has produced a new occupational profile that de Vries calls &quot;Sexual Accompaniment&quot; or &quot;Sexual Assistance&quot;. At the &quot;Integra Conference for Care, Therapy and Rehabilitation&quot; in Wels, Austria, where she presented her training concept, she gave a definition for this profession:

Sexual assistance is an &quot;opportunity to experience&quot;. With these simple words de Vries describes her profession, stating that with such assistance a paid sexual service is offered, similar to prostitution. She believes, however, that the attitude with which this service is provided is different. It is, if possible, an assist for self-help. In contrast to prostitution, intensive personal relationships are necessary not only with the clientele, but also with the persons who care for them. De Vries is convinced that these relationships create special preconditions for the profession and should be taken into account in the training. Such training took place, for the first time, when de Vries trained sex assistants at the &quot;Institute for Self-Determination of the Disabled &quot; (German: &quot;Institut zur Selbst-Bestimmung Behinderter (ISBB)&quot;) in 2002.

De Vries sees the difference between &quot;Sexual Assistance&quot; and &quot;Surrogate Partnership&quot; at different levels. On one hand, she perceives a sexual assistant not as a &quot;substitute partner&quot; for the client, but rather someone offering a very personal, individually designed relationship. It is different from a love affair. Nina de Vries calls this an &quot;encounter&quot; – with people &quot;who are not scheming because they are not able to be scheming.&quot; On the other hand, sexual assistance does not pursue any therapeutic goals, but aims to help people who can not express themselves without help make decisions about sexual self-determination.

The self-determination of her clientele is in the foreground. &quot;If someone just wants to have my hand on his stomach for an hour, that&#x27;s okay. For an autistic person to allow that can be a high accomplishment.&quot;

<text>Meggan Puceanu is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, usually as a supporting character in stories featuring Captain Britain, and the X-Men. A mutant empath and shapeshifting elemental, she was created by writer Alan Moore and artist Alan Davis, and first appeared in &quot;Mighty World of Marvel&quot; #7 (Dec. 1983), which was published in the United Kingdom by Marvel&#x27;s British publication arm, Marvel UK. Her first appearance in an American Marvel publication was in &quot;The New Mutants&quot; Annual #2 (1986). She eventually chose the codename Gloriana, a name of victory coined by the demons of Hell.

==Publication history==

Meggan first appears in Marvel UK&#x27;s &quot;Mighty World of Marvel&quot; #7 (Dec. 1983), and was created by writer Alan Moore and artist Alan Davis.

Her origin story is told in &quot;Captain Britain&quot; vol. 2 #8 (Aug. 1985), which was later reprinted in the &quot;Captain Britain&quot; trade paperback in the U.S.

Meggan&#x27;s first American appearance is in &quot;The New Mutants&quot; Annual #2 (1986).

Her original family name is recorded for the first time in 2008 in &quot;Captain Britain and MI: 13&quot; #7, and again in &quot;Captain Britain and MI: 13&quot; Annual #1 (2009).

==Fictional character biography==
Born in a blizzard to a British Romanichal family near Fenborough Station in England, Meggan adapted to the cold by growing fur, to the horror of her family. Unfortunately, as an empathic metamorph, the more they saw her as a monster, the more monstrous she became, growing webbing upon her hands and feet, antennae on her head, claws, and patagia. The belief that she was some sort of monster was also affected by the fact that Meggan&#x27;s birth took place near an ancient British fortress that was rumoured to be the site of dark magics. Meggan&#x27;s family hid her away in their camper, where she watched television incessantly, totally immersing herself in the fantasy of the various British TV shows of the time (such as Gerry Anderson fare, &quot;Quatermass&quot;, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and many more). Eventually, she met Captain Britain and fought him, but then befriended him. She fell in love with him, joining him as an adventurer. With him, she first encountered Gatecrasher&#x27;s Technet. After having been told by a telepath that her inner soul looked as beautiful &quot;as an iridescent butterfly&quot;, during combat against a commando of R.C.X.-controlled &quot;Warpies&quot;, she stabilized her powers on an attractive form that pleased Brian (and thus pleased her). Captain Britain fell in love right back, and the two began a romantic relationship. Together, they defeated Baba Yaga. The two had a long and stormy courtship, marred by events both cosmic and mundane.

===Forming Excalibur===
Meggan then fought Gatecrasher&#x27;s Technet alongside Captain Britain, Nightcrawler, Phoenix, and Shadowcat, and with them became a founding member of Excalibur. A few months after she and Brian helped found Excalibur, Meggan resumed the search for her parents, traveling to Europe with Phoenix (Rachel Summers) tracking a rumor of a &quot;magic creature&quot; hidden in a Gypsy&#x27;s van. The story proved to be about a being belonging to a mystical race called the Neuri, who showed Meggan her true appearance. Excalibur clashed with Arcade and the Crazy Gang, and Meggan temporarily switched bodies with the Crazy Gang&#x27;s Knave. 

Meggan and Brian are wed, with the celebration attended by all their friends (and some enemies) in the 125th issue of &quot;Excalibur&quot;.

Due to her odd upbringing, for many years, Meggan was naive in many of the aspects of culture, obsessed with television and functionally illiterate. For example, she did not know that Doctor Doom was such a horrific threat, though she soon learned when he attacked the entire team and attempted to destroy England.

Her Excalibur teammates, over the years, brought her up to speed with Earthly life and knowledge. Douglock took a personal effort in being her teacher after he joined the team. In the latter part of the Excalibur series, Meggan became much more self-confident, taking more of a leadership role, changing her costume and being much more threatening. She used the minimum of force needed, but did not hesitate to scare her adversaries.

===Ruling Otherworld===
When Roma stepped down and let Captain Britain become the Omniversal Guardian of the Otherworld, Meggan came to rule beside him as his queen. They supervised the origin of another Captain Britain, who became associated with the Avengers.

===House of M===
Later, the Scarlet Witch caused a hole in reality when she altered it to create the House of M. This set off a multidimensional tidal wave, threatening Otherworld and the other parallel realities of the Omniverse. Meggan and Captain Britain were sent to fix the hole, given only a short amount of time before Saturnyne would destroy the 616 reality to prevent it from hurting the other realities. Working with Princess Royal Elizabeth Glorianna Braddock and Rachel Summers, Meggan and Captain Britain located the hole in reality through which the tidal chaos wave was about to spread. Allowing the others to seal the gap, Meggan ventured into the void beyond and sacrificed herself to briefly slow the progress of the impacting chaotic energies to give Betsy, Rachel, and Captain Britain time to sew the reality tear.

When reality was restored, only a few remembered what had occurred during the House of M. Captain Britain and the others were among the many who didn&#x27;t, having only vague memories of the ordeal and believing it to be a dream. As a result, Brian doesn&#x27;t know about Meggan&#x27;s sacrifice and has no idea where she is, leaving him in distress.

===Plokta&#x27;s Dream World===
After Pete Wisdom releases the dark and evil magic to prevent the Skrull invasion in England, Plokta, a duke of Hell, tries to make a deal with Captain Britain and reveals what appears to be Meggan in his collection of otherworldly realms. Captain Britain, knowing it might be merely an illusion, states that he can&#x27;t take the chance of it being real and plunges through the dimensional gate. After sealing it shut, Plokta informs his underlings that this was merely a dream world and he was delighted that Captain Britain allowed himself to be sealed within it. Within the dream world, Meggan and Captain Britain live at least several weeks believing it to be reality, though Brian expresses doubts about inconsistencies of the world. His train of thought on the subject, however, is disrupted when he and Meggan&#x27;s quiet lunch in Braddock&#x27;s pub is attacked by his deceased brother Jamie Braddock.

Meggan is eventually revealed to still be alive, but lost between dimensions.

===Hell and back===
Meggan is soon revealed to be trapped in Hell. Unlike most of its occupants, however, she is not in torment, and still senses hope reaching her from outside of Hell—a fact that disturbs the Lords of Hell greatly. During her audience with them, they trick her into using her empathy, which forces her to assume a hideous and misshapen form and trap her in it. The lords, having &quot;judged&quot; her, quickly exile her into another portion of Hell. However, an angry Meggan lashes out with her empathy, which causes all other lesser demons in her presence to rally behind her, having been affected by her anger. This catches the attention of Pluto, the Roman God of the Underworld (and old enemy of Hercules). They forge an alliance and he restores Meggan to her usual self.

She spends the following months leading her army of demon followers in waging a war against the Lords of Hell, very successfully since her empathy overwhelms the enemy armies, causing them to turn on their respective lords (most noticeably Blackheart). During one such battle, she feels nostalgic and reminisces about her husband Brian. This causes her army to feel happiness, something that they haven&#x27;t experienced in a while—if at all. The demons name her &quot;Gloriana&quot; in honor of this feat, and idolize her further. After a while she forms a kingdom, &quot;Elysium&quot;, to serve as a sanctuary for souls to escape torment, and gives Pluto part of her conquests in payment.

Following that, she left in hope of searching for a way home. After having wandered through a large part of Hell, she finally finds a crack through which moonlight pours through. Quickly she passes through the crack, only to be greeted by Doctor Doom on the other side, within Dracula&#x27;s ship departing from the Moon.

===Reunited with Brian===
As Dracula begins his invasion of Britain, he is confronted with more resistance than expected, along with some of his vampires resisting him, going as far as even directly disobeying him. Doctor Doom contacts him briefly, telling him that he has left him a gift in his ship&#x27;s hold. Located in the ship is Meggan, much to Dracula&#x27;s confusion. However, he soon realizes that Meggan is the reason why his mental hold on the other vampires is growing weaker, since she uses her mental powers to &quot;broadcast rebellion&quot;. Dracula attempts to kill her but is stopped by Captain Britain, who is furious at the vampire king. Meggan and Brian battle the vampires and Dracula until the ship and majority of vampires are destroyed via a spell. Once the battle is over, Meggan and Brian are happily reunited.

Meggan later joined Captain Britain in starting the Braddock Academy.

During the &quot;Infinity&quot; storyline, Meggan represented the Braddock Academy when Henry Pym planned a &quot;Contest of Champions&quot; event. She assists Henry Pym, She-Hulk and Wolverine in supervising the event.

Meggan and Brian (Captain Britain) are reunited with their Excalibur teammates as they welcome Nightcrawler back from the dead.

==Powers and abilities==
Meggan is a powerful superhuman, an &quot;empathic metamorph&quot; or &quot;elemental megamorph&quot;, with the apparent ability to assume virtually any superhuman power in existence at will. Her abilities include empathy, an elemental link to nature and mystical energies, and shapeshifting.

Meggan&#x27;s empathy enables her to sense the emotions and feelings of living creatures (from people, to animals, to plants), and including the ability to psionically perceive an object&#x27;s or person&#x27;s psychic, natural, and mystical energy aura. Meggan&#x27;s empathy has also given her an affinity toward learning both human language and animal communication systems.

Her empathic powers used to make her sensitive to surrounding moods, making her change appearance depending on themselves, their needs, or perceptions, and make her vulnerable to certain telepathic manipulation. Primarily when she herself was either in a vulnerable emotional state, distracted, focused on the person in question or her powers were in a minor flux from lack of mystical sustenance.

She eventually overcame most of the issues of this, and rather learned to broadcast her own feelings to influence other people&#x27;s emotions to the extent that she incited a rebellion in the part of hell ruled by Blackheart, and disrupted Dracula&#x27;s control of his vampires by &quot;broadcasting rebellion&quot;.

Meggan&#x27;s empathy creates a psionic link to the natural forces of the Earth. By &quot;speaking&quot; to the elements, Meggan can command the environment around her, and her emotional state can affect the local ecosystems. Through thought alone, Meggan can extinguish forest fires, summon gale-force winds, and part the waters of a lake or cause earthquakes in a flash of anger. Meggan has even been observed causing electromagnetic pulses by commanding the magnetic fields around her, freezing opponents by rapidly dropping the air temperature around them, or increasing the powers of elemental mutants (such as increasing the temperature of Pete Wisdom&#x27;s heat blasts). Meggan has used her elemental powers to affect man-made objects, such as making the atoms in a building&#x27;s roof move apart, creating a hole in the roof that resealed itself once Meggan passed through. Meggan can also project very powerful blasts, orbs, waves and beams of elemental energy for different purpose, such as to destroy or hit objects or people with a great force, illuminate an area, etc, as well as generate energy constructions such as force fields or screens of elemental energy. She has also been observed controlling mystical energies. Meggan can also hover and fly; she once commented during a case where she was working undercover that her feet hurt, because she was unused to walking entirely, not seeing the point when she could more easily fly.

By combining her powers with Rachel Summers on an alternate Earth filled with magic, Meggan succeeded in bringing the dead back to life.

Meggan can alter her form at will and can assume the form of any creature, even those who only exist in legends. Initially, she changed forms unconsciously. As a newborn infant, she instinctively adopted a fur-covered, somewhat animal-like form in response to the cold weather around her. Her empathic powers made her vulnerable to the superstitions of her people and their fear of her powers caused her to shapeshift into an increasingly hideous form. It was not until she began adventuring with Captain Britain and working with psychic Alison Double that she came to understand the extent of her powers. Currently, Meggan&#x27;s usual form is a blond woman with pointed ears (some texts indicate that this form is based, subconsciously, on Captain Britain&#x27;s expectations). It took several more years for Meggan to discover her natural form: taller than a normal human, with longer platinum blond hair, pointed ears, and black eyes.

Meggan can add to her mass and shed this additional mass at will. Meggan adopts the special abilities, superhuman powers, and even aspects of the internal anatomy of whatever being she uses her metamorphic powers to imitate. She once became a Godzilla-like fire-breathing dragon, and on another occasion she became a werewolf that had all of a wolf&#x27;s natural abilities. Meggan can assume the form of other people as well. Her facial features and overall physical appearance often change to a degree with her mood. Although she retains better control of her form as an adult, Meggan may consciously or unconsciously alter her appearance to resemble people or even animals she is with at the time and still occasionally changes form in response to the emotions around her: becoming beautiful when she feels loved, or hideous when she feels fear or anger, or she might become considerably less attractive when deeply depressed. Usually, this happens when she is under stress or spends significant time away from the British Isles. Her elemental powers also cause Meggan to change in response to her surroundings, growing fur in extreme cold, or gills when she is submerged or swimming underwater.

She can increase the density of her muscle tissue to boost her strength and/or speed to superhuman levels, shown capable of exceeding that of Captain Britain on two separate occasions. The use of this power is tied to the planet itself. During her confrontation with Galactus, she grew in stature to match the planet-eater&#x27;s size, but the taller she grew, the more she was destabilizing the environment nearby.

Meggan&#x27;s most formidable talent is her ability to instantly mimic the powers of other superhumans, in one case turning into fully empowered duplicates of Dazzler, Rogue, Colossus, Longshot, Storm, Wolverine, Rachel Summers, and Havok in rapid succession. Given sufficient magic energy in her surroundings she has even effortlessly turned into a female copy of the Silver Surfer. She has also transformed herself into sentient sand or water, and attained the associated properties.

Meggan is a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, trained by Captain Britain. She has no formal education and is self-taught about contemporary culture through television viewing, although her allies from Excalibur take the time to bring her &#x27;up to speed&#x27;.

==Reception==
* In 2014, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Meggan 90th in their &quot;Let&#x27;s rank every X-Man ever&quot; list.
* In 2018, &quot;CBR.com&quot; ranked Meggan 5th in their &quot;20 Most Powerful Mutants From The &#x27;80s&quot; list.

==Other versions==
On Earth-597, a world where the Nazis have won World War II, Meggan is a member of that reality&#x27;s equivalent of Excalibur, Lightning Force.

The world of Earth-1189 was devastated by nuclear war. After the death of her Brian Braddock, Meggan takes over the mantle of Captain Britain and becomes a member of the Corps.

On Earth-99746, a world populated by humanoid dinosaurs, the Excalibur-equivalent contains an alternate version of Meggan called Megon who helps defeat the Fantastic Five before traveling to Earth-616.

Two different versions of Meggan appear in the Secret Wars storyline; one version is from the domain Higher Avalon where she is carrying Brian Braddock&#x27;s baby. The other version appears as a member of A-Force in the domain Arcadia.

<text>Iver is a civil parish in Buckinghamshire, England. In addition to the central clustered village, the parish includes the residential neighbourhoods of Iver Heath and Richings Park and the hamlets of Shreding Green and Thorney.

==Geography, transport and economy==
Part of the 43-square-mile Colne Valley regional park, with woods, lakes and land by the Grand Union Canal. Most of the open land is classified as Metropolitan Green Belt.

Surrounding the Ivers are neighbouring villages and towns of Fulmer, Denham, Gerrards Cross and Wexham. Also nearby are Colnbrook, Langley, Uxbridge, Cowley, Yiewsley and West Drayton.

The Ivers have public transport and motorway links. The M25 motorway and M4 motorway, including the Thorney Interchange, are nearby, while to the north of the Ivers is the M40 motorway as well as the A40, which is parallel to the M40.

Also situated on the Elizabeth line, Iver, Richings Park and Thorney are less than from Iver railway station, with Langley railway station and Uxbridge tube station nearby for other villages across the Iver&#x27;s.

Two significant employers in the parish are the Ridgeway trading and warehousing estate in Richings Park and Pinewood Studios in Iver Heath.

==History==
In the Domesday Book of 1086 the whole area was recorded as &quot;Evreham&quot; or &quot;homestead by the brow of a hill&quot; and it was in the possession of a man called Robert Doiley.
 In 1351 the area was granted a Royal charter to hold a weekly market. This charter was confirmed 110 years later in 1461.

===Iver===
Iver village on the Uxbridge to Langley road has a pre-&quot;Domesday&quot; foundation and Neolithic pottery fragments and other artefacts have been discovered. The village church has shards of a Saxon window, and elements dating from the 15th century, 16th century and 17th century can be seen. The village has numerous houses from the 16th and 17th centuries.

===Thorney===
In the spring of 893 a Viking raiding army plundered through Kent and Sussex. After reaching Farnham in Surrey it was intercepted by Alfred the Great&#x27;s son Edward with his West Saxon Fyrd. The Danes were routed, fleeing over the River Thames into Mercia with the West Saxon army in pursuit. Having reached the River Colne the Danes mounted a defence on what was known as Thorney Island, believed to be land between the Colne and an offshoot channel of the river between Thorney and Iver. Edward began a siege of the island and was joined by Æthelred of Mercia with soldiers from the Mercian garrison in London. After a prolonged stalemate an agreement was reached with the Danes that they would to leave the Angle and Saxon controlled lands peacefully and go directly to the lands in the east under Danish control which they duly did, without any of their plundered spoils.

===Iver Heath===
Iver Heath is the location of Heatherden Hall, a Victorian estate with spectacular grounds. It was purchased by Lt. Col. Grant Morden, a Canadian financier, who transformed the mansion by adding a huge ballroom and Turkish bath. During the 1930s it became a retreat and private meeting place for politicians and diplomats. The agreement to form the Irish Free State was signed at Heatherden Hall. The Church of St Margaret was built in 1862. Iver Heath itself is centred on a triangle of roads. The village post office was on the Slough Road to the south, but closed in September 2020, while a parade of shops used to be found along Church Road to the north. Slough Road and Church Road are connected by Bangors Road North to the east.

===Richings Park===
Richings Park was once the estate of Lord Bathurst. In the 1630s, the Richings estate was owned by the Salter family, who in 1678 sold it to Sir Peter Apsley. His daughter Catherine married her cousin, Allen Bathurst, 1st Earl Bathurst. Around 1740, the estate was sold to the Earl of Hertford, and in 1776 to Sir John Coghill, 1st Baronet of Richings.

In the 1780s, the house was burned down and rebuilt. It was later the home of the Sullivan and Meeking families. Ironically, in 1924, Viola Meeking married into the Bathurst family who had held the Richings Park estate two centuries earlier.

The new Richings Park mansion, very briefly the home of RAF Bomber Command, was destroyed during World War II, and its site is now a residential area with its own shopping facilities.

==Black Park Country Park and Langley Park Country Park==
Black Park adjoins the Pinewood Studio complex. It has a lake that extends over . Due to its proximity to Pinewood Studios, Black Park was used for outdoor sequences in some of Hammer&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot; films, a number of &quot;Carry On&quot; films, the Gerry Anderson Sci Fi series UFO and in the 1964 James Bond film &quot;Goldfinger&quot;.

To the south, Black Park is separated from Langley Park by the A412 / Uxbridge Road. Langley Park covers 130 acres (0.53 km2) and is known for its rhododendron and azalea-filled Temple Gardens.

==Pinewood Studios==

Pinewood Studios is a major British film studio to the immediate west of the developed land of Iver Heath, which is in all other respects residential. The studios have hosted many productions from blockbuster films to UK television shows, commercials and pop music promos. The Superman and James Bond film franchises have used the film studios which provides tours of its museum.

Pinewood was built on the estate of Heatherden Hall, a large, attractive Victorian house with spectacular grounds. The Pinewood estate had previously been purchased by Lt. Col. Grant Morden, a Canadian financier and MP for Brentford and Chiswick. He spent a fortune transforming the mansion into a showpiece home, adding refinements such as a huge ballroom, a Turkish bath and an indoor squash court. Due to its seclusion, the house was used as a discreet meeting place for high-ranking politicians and diplomats. Here the agreement for the Anglo-Irish Treaty was signed. When Grant Morden died in 1934 the estate was purchased at auction by Charles Boot, who had recently inherited a large construction firm from his father, Henry Boot, who died in 1931. Within twelve months Charles had formed a partnership with J. Arthur Rank, who transformed the mansion into the office building for a film studio complex. He based his new studios on the latest Hollywood designs of that era. Charles Boot named the complex Pinewood Film Studios, a reference to the many pine trees in the area. The entrance to the studio is on Pinewood Road.

<doc id="413090" wikidata="Q1282268" url="?curid=413090" title="Ed Ames">
<text>Edmund Dantes Urick (July 9, 1927 – May 21, 2023), known professionally as Ed Ames or Eddie Ames, was an American pop singer and actor. He was known for playing Mingo in the television series &quot;Daniel Boone&quot;, and for his Easy Listening number #1 hits of the mid-to-late 1960s including &quot;My Cup Runneth Over&quot;, &quot;Time, Time&quot;, and &quot;When the Snow Is on the Roses&quot;. He was also part of the popular 1950s singing group with his siblings, the Ames Brothers.

==Early life and career==

Ames was born in Malden, Massachusetts, on July 9, 1927, to Jewish parents Sarah (Zaslavskaya) and David Urick, a.k.a. Eurich, who had emigrated from Ukraine. He was the youngest of nine children, five boys and four girls.

Ames grew up in a poor household. He attended the Boston Latin School and was educated in classical and opera music, as well as literature. While still in high school, the brothers formed a quartet and often won competitions around the Boston area. Three of the brothers later formed the Amory Brothers quartet and went to New York City, where they were hired by bandleader Art Mooney. Playwright Abe Burrows helped the brothers along the way, suggesting the siblings change their group&#x27;s name to the Ames Brothers.

The Ames Brothers were first signed on with Decca Records in 1947, but because of the Musician Union&#x27;s ban in 1948, a holdover from the 1942–1944 musicians&#x27; strike, Decca released only three singles by the brothers, and one backing Russ Morgan. As the ban was ending, they signed with Coral Records, a subsidiary of Decca. They had their first major hit in the 1950s with the double-sided &quot;Rag Mop&quot; and &quot;Sentimental Me&quot;. The brothers later joined RCA Victor records and continued to have success throughout the 1950s with many hits like &quot;It Only Hurts For a Little While&quot;, &quot;You, You, You&quot;, and &quot;The Naughty Lady of Shady Lane&quot;. The brothers made regular appearances on network television variety programs, and in 1955 briefly had a 15-minute show of their own.

==Acting career==

In the early 1960s, the Ames Brothers disbanded, and Ed Ames, pursuing a career in acting, studied at the Herbert Berghof School. His first starring role was in an off-Broadway production of Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;The Crucible&quot;, going on to starring performances in &quot;The Fantasticks&quot; off-Broadway and &quot;Carnival!&quot;, which was on Broadway.

Ames was in the national touring company of &quot;Carnival&quot;. His dark complexion and sharp facial features led to his being cast regularly as a Native American. He played Chief Bromden in the Broadway production of &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;, opposite Kirk Douglas.

Talent scouts at 20th Century Fox saw Ames in the production and invited him to play the Cherokee tribesman, Mingo on the NBC television series &quot;Daniel Boone&quot;, with Fess Parker. His character&#x27;s father was an English officer, the Fourth Earl of Dunmore, played in the show by Walter Pidgeon. In that show, Mingo was the Earl&#x27;s eldest son and thus entitled to claim the title as the fifth Earl, but decided to remain part of the Cherokee Nation.

In an episode of Season One, Ames also portrayed Mingo&#x27;s evil twin brother, Taramingo. Ames&#x27; main character was actually named Caramingo, but went by Mingo throughout the entire series.

Ames played a wanted murderer holed-up in a hotel during a smallpox quarantine on a 1962 &quot;The Rifleman&quot; episode (&quot;Quiet Night, Deadly Night&quot;), and guest-starred as Kennedy in the 1963 episode &quot;The Day of the Pawnees, Part 2&quot; on ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters&quot;, with Kurt Russell in the title role. He guest-starred in 1963 on Richard Egan&#x27;s NBC modern western series, &quot;Redigo&quot;.

===&quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;===
While playing Mingo on television, Ames developed some skill in throwing a tomahawk. This led to one of the most memorable moments of his career, when he appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; on April 27, 1965.

During the course of the show, Ames and Johnny Carson were discussing Ames&#x27; tomahawk throwing abilities. When Ames claimed that he could hit a target from across the room, Carson asked Ames if he could demonstrate this skill. Ames agreed, and a wood panel with a chalk outline of a cowboy was brought on to the stage. As the studio band played a bar of the theme music from &quot;Adventures of Pow Wow&quot;, Ames proceeded to throw the tomahawk, which hit the drawn cowboy square in the groin with the handle pointing upward. This led to a very long burst of laughter from the audience.

After a moment, Ames proceeded to walk toward the target to retrieve the tomahawk but Carson stopped him and allowed the situation to be appreciated for its humor. Ames then said to Carson: &quot;Think I&#x27;m going into another business, John.&quot; To which Carson ad-libbed: &quot;I didn&#x27;t even know you were Jewish!&quot; and &quot;Welcome to &quot;Frontier Bris&quot;.&quot; (It&#x27;s not known whether Carson was aware that Ames actually was Jewish.)

Ames then asked Carson if he would like to take a turn throwing, to which Carson replied: &quot;I can&#x27;t hurt him any more than you did.&quot; The clip became a favorite of Carson&#x27;s own yearly highlight show and subsequent blooper television specials.

===Summer stock===
Later in his career, Ames became a fixture on the Kenley Players circuit, headlining in &quot;Shenandoah&quot; (1976, 1979, 1986), &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; (1977), &quot;South Pacific&quot; (1980), &quot;Camelot&quot; (1981), and &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; (1984).

==Singing career==

Ames recorded under the name &quot;Eddie Ames&quot; while still with the Ames Brothers, releasing the single &quot;The Bean Song (Which Way to Boston?)&quot; in January, 1957.

Ames returned to singing as a solo artist in 1965. Ames is known for his baritone voice. He released his first RCA Victor chart single, &quot;Try to Remember&quot;. The song did respectably (#73 on the pop charts, #17 in the Adult Contemporary listing). A bigger success came in 1967 with &quot;My Cup Runneth Over&quot;. The song was both a #8 pop hit and a #1 adult contemporary radio hit. Thereafter he had Adult Contemporary hits with &quot;Time, Time&quot;, &quot;When the Snow Is on the Roses&quot;, and &quot;Timeless Love&quot;, the latter written by Buffy Sainte-Marie. He did make the pop Top 20 one last time in his singing career with &quot;Who Will Answer?&quot; in 1968. &quot;Apologize&quot; reached No. 47 in the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; Magazine hot singles chart.

Ames&#x27;s distinctive baritone is a regular radio presence during Christmas season, as well, thanks to his version of &quot;Do You Hear What I Hear?&quot; The song received its best-selling treatment from Bing Crosby in 1962, but Ames&#x27; version, recorded a few years later, is in frequent holiday rotation.

Ames also sang the &quot;Ballad of the War Wagon&quot; in the John Wayne/Batjac Productions movie, &quot;The War Wagon&quot; in 1967.

==Personal life==
Ed Ames married Sarita (Sara) Cacheiro in 1947 and they had three children, Sonya, Ronald, and Linda (aka Marcila, who died in 2007). The couple divorced October 5, 1973 in Santa Monica, California. Ames married Jeanne Arnold Saviano in 1998, the marriage lasted until his death in 2023. 

While maintaining his career, he attended University of California, Los Angeles, receiving his degree in theater and cinema arts in 1975.

At the age of 77, Ames, saying &quot;I am a secular Jew, but I feel strongly about Israel and the Jewish communities of Europe&quot;, became president of the Los Angeles chapter of the Zionist Organization of America.

While appearing in &quot;Daniel Boone&quot;, Ames maintained homes in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, and Teaneck, New Jersey.

From 1968 until 1987, he also owned a percentage of the Phoenix Suns.

Ames died of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease at his Beverly Hills, California, home on May 21, 2023, at the age of 95. He is buried at Pierce Brothers Westwood Village Memorial Park and Mortuary in Westwood, California.

<doc id="413092" wikidata="Q303288" url="?curid=413092" title="Solar thermal energy">
<text>Solar thermal energy (STE) is a form of energy and a technology for harnessing solar energy to generate thermal energy for use in industry, and in the residential and commercial sectors. Solar thermal collectors are classified by the United States Energy Information Administration as low-, medium-, or high-temperature collectors. Low-temperature collectors are generally unglazed and used to heat swimming pools or to heat ventilation air. Medium-temperature collectors are also usually flat plates but are used for heating water or air for residential and commercial use.

High-temperature collectors concentrate sunlight using mirrors or lenses and are generally used for fulfilling heat requirements up to () / 20 bar (300 psi) pressure in industries, and for electric power production. Two categories include Concentrated Solar Thermal (CST) for fulfilling heat requirements in industries, and concentrated solar power (CSP) when the heat collected is used for electric power generation. CST and CSP are not replaceable in terms of application.

Unlike photovoltaic cells that convert sunlight directly into electricity, solar thermal systems convert it into heat. They use mirrors or lenses to concentrate sunlight onto a receiver, which in turn heats a water reservoir. The heated water can then be used in homes. The advantage of solar thermal is that the heated water can be stored until it is needed, eliminating the need for a separate energy storage system. Solar thermal power can also be converted to electricity by using the steam generated from the heated water to drive a turbine connected to a generator. However, because generating electricity this way is much more expensive than photovoltaic power plants, there are very few in use today.

== History ==
Augustin Mouchot demonstrated a solar collector with a cooling engine making ice cream at the 1878 Universal Exhibition in Paris. The first installation of solar thermal energy equipment occurred in the Sahara approximately in 1910 by Frank Shuman when a steam engine was run on steam produced by sunlight. Because liquid fuel engines were developed and found more convenient, the Sahara project was abandoned, only to be revisited several decades later. As of 2023, the world&#x27;s largest thermal solar power plant is in the United Arab Emirates.

== Low-temperature heating and cooling ==
Systems for utilizing low-temperature solar thermal energy include means for heat collection; usually heat storage, either short-term or interseasonal; and distribution within a structure or a district heating network. In some cases a single feature can do more than one of these things (e.g. some kinds of solar collectors also store heat). Some systems are passive, others are active (requiring other external energy to function).

Heating is the most obvious application, but solar cooling can be achieved for a building or for district cooling by using a heat-driven absorption or adsorption chiller (heat pump). There is a productive coincidence that the greater the driving heat from insolation, the greater the cooling output. In 1878, Auguste Mouchout pioneered solar cooling by making ice using a solar steam engine attached to a refrigeration device.

In the United States, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems account for over 25% (4.75 EJ) of the energy used in commercial buildings (50% in northern cities) and nearly half (10.1 EJ) of the energy used in residential buildings. Solar heating, cooling, and ventilation technologies can be used to offset a portion of this energy. The most popular solar heating technology for heating buildings is the building integrated transpired solar air collection system which connects to the building&#x27;s HVAC equipment. According to Solar Energy Industries Association over 500,000 m2 (5,000,000 square feet) of these panels are in operation in North America as of 2015.

In Europe, since the mid-1990s about 125 large solar-thermal district heating
plants have been constructed, each with over 500 m2 (5400 ft2) of solar
collectors. The largest are about 10,000 m2 (2.5 acres), with capacities of 7
MW-thermal and solar heat costs around 4 Eurocents/kWh without subsidies.
40 of them have nominal capacities of 1 MW-thermal or more. The Solar District Heating program (SDH) has participation from 14 European Nations and the European Commission, and is working toward technical and market development, and holds annual conferences.

=== Low-temperature collectors ===
Glazed solar collectors are designed primarily for space heating. They recirculate building air through a solar air panel where the air is heated and then directed back into the building. These solar space heating systems require at least two penetrations into the building and only perform when the air in the solar collector is warmer than the building room temperature. Most glazed collectors are used in the residential sector.

Unglazed solar collectors are primarily used to pre-heat make-up ventilation air in commercial, industrial and institutional buildings with a high ventilation load. They turn building walls or sections of walls into low cost, high performance, unglazed solar collectors. Also called, &quot;transpired solar panels&quot; or &quot;solar wall&quot;, they employ a painted perforated metal solar heat absorber that also serves as the exterior wall surface of the building. Heat transfer to the air takes place on the surface of the absorber, through the metal absorber and behind the absorber. The boundary layer of solar heated air is drawn into a nearby perforation before the heat can escape by convection to the outside air. The heated air is then drawn from behind the absorber plate into the building&#x27;s ventilation system.

A Trombe wall is a passive solar heating and ventilation system consisting of an air channel sandwiched between a window and a sun-facing thermal mass. During the ventilation cycle, sunlight stores heat in the thermal mass and warms the air channel causing circulation through vents at the top and bottom of the wall. During the heating cycle the Trombe wall radiates stored heat.

Solar roof ponds for solar heating and cooling were developed by Harold Hay in the 1960s. A basic system consists of a roof-mounted water bladder with a movable insulating cover. This system can control heat exchange between interior and exterior environments by covering and uncovering the bladder between night and day. When heating is a concern the bladder is uncovered during the day allowing sunlight to warm the water bladder and store heat for evening use. When cooling is a concern the covered bladder draws heat from the building&#x27;s interior during the day and is uncovered at night to radiate heat to the cooler atmosphere. The Skytherm house in Atascadero, California uses a prototype roof pond for heating and cooling.

Solar space heating with solar air heat collectors is more popular in the USA and Canada than heating with solar liquid collectors since most buildings already have a ventilation system for heating and cooling. The two main types of solar air panels are glazed and unglazed.

Of the of solar thermal collectors produced in the United States in 2007, were of the low-temperature variety. Low-temperature collectors are generally installed to heat swimming pools, although they can also be used for space heating. Collectors can use air or water as the medium to transfer the heat to their destination. The sun&#x27;s free energy can also be used to heat water to fulfil domestic hot water demands, such as the hot water that comes out of taps. Solar thermal water heating systems can provide approximately 50% of a property&#x27;s annual hot water demand (depending on the size of the property, its location etc) which in turn can help homeowners make savings on their energy bills.

== Heat storage for space heating ==
A collection of mature technologies called seasonal thermal energy storage (STES) is capable of storing heat for months at a time, so solar heat collected primarily in Summer can be used for all-year heating. Solar-supplied STES technology has been advanced primarily in Denmark, Germany, and Canada, and applications include individual buildings and district heating networks. Drake Landing Solar Community in Alberta, Canada has a small district system and in 2012 achieved a world record of providing 97% of the community&#x27;s all-year space heating needs from the sun. STES thermal storage mediums include deep aquifers; native rock surrounding clusters of small-diameter, heat exchanger equipped boreholes; large, shallow, lined pits that are filled with gravel and top-insulated; and large, insulated and buried surface water tanks.

Centralized district heating round the clock is also feasible with concentrated solar thermal (CST) storage plant.

Interseasonal storage. Solar heat (or heat from other sources) can be effectively stored between opposing seasons in aquifers, underground geological strata, large specially constructed pits, and large tanks that are insulated and covered with earth.

Short-term storage. Thermal mass materials store solar energy during the day and release this energy during cooler periods. Common thermal mass materials include stone, concrete, and water. The proportion and placement of thermal mass should consider several factors such as climate, daylighting, and shading conditions. When properly incorporated, thermal mass can passively maintain comfortable temperatures while reducing energy consumption.

=== Solar-driven cooling ===
Worldwide, by 2011 there were about 750 cooling systems with solar-driven heat pumps, and annual market growth was 40 to 70% over the prior seven years. It is a niche market because the economics are challenging, with the annual number of cooling hours a limiting factor. Respectively, the annual cooling time is roughly 1000 hours in the Mediterranean, 2500 hours in Southeast Asia, and only 50 to 200 hours in Central Europe. However, system construction costs dropped about 50% between 2007 and 2011. The International Energy Agency (IEA) Solar Heating and Cooling program (IEA-SHC) task groups working on further development of the technologies involved.

=== Solar-heat-driven ventilation ===

A solar chimney (or thermal chimney) is a passive solar ventilation system composed of a hollow thermal mass connecting the interior and exterior of a building. As the chimney warms, the air inside is heated causing an updraft that pulls air through the building. These systems have been in use since Roman times and remain common in the Middle East.

=== Process heat ===


Solar process heating systems are designed to provide large quantities of hot water or space heating for nonresidential buildings.

Evaporation ponds are shallow ponds that concentrate dissolved solids through evaporation. The use of evaporation ponds to obtain salt from sea water is one of the oldest applications of solar energy. Modern uses include concentrating brine solutions used in leach mining and removing dissolved solids from waste streams. Altogether, evaporation ponds represent one of the largest commercial applications of solar energy in use today.

Unglazed transpired collectors are perforated sun-facing walls used for preheating ventilation air. Transpired collectors can also be roof mounted for year-round use and can raise the incoming air temperature up to 22 °C (72 °F) and deliver outlet temperatures of 45–60 °C (110–140 °F). The short payback period of transpired collectors (3 to 12 years) make them a more cost-effective alternative to glazed collection systems. As of 2015, over 4000 systems with a combined collector area of 500,000 m2 (100 acres) had been installed worldwide. Representatives include an 860 m2 (9,300 ft2) collector in Costa Rica used for drying coffee beans and a 1300 m2 (14,000 ft2) collector in Coimbatore, India used for drying marigolds.

A food processing facility in Modesto, California uses parabolic troughs to produce steam used in the manufacturing process. The 5,000 m2 collector area is expected to provide 15 TJ per year.
== Medium-temperature collectors ==
These collectors could be used to produce approximately 50% and more of the hot water needed for residential and commercial use in the United States. In the United States, a typical system costs $4000–$6000 retail ($1400 to $2200 wholesale for the materials) and 30% of the system qualifies for a federal tax credit + additional state credit exists in about half of the states. Labor for a simple open loop system in southern climates can take 3–5 hours for the installation and 4–6 hours in Northern areas. Northern system require more collector area and more complex plumbing to protect the collector from freezing. With this incentive, the payback time for a typical household is four to nine years, depending on the state. Similar subsidies exist in parts of Europe. A crew of one solar plumber and two assistants with minimal training can install a system per day. Thermosiphon installation have negligible maintenance costs (costs rise if antifreeze and mains power are used for circulation) and in the US reduces a household&#x27;s operating costs by $6 per person per month. Solar water heating can reduce CO2 emissions of a family of four by 1 ton/year (if replacing natural gas) or 3 ton/year (if replacing electricity). Medium-temperature installations can use any of several designs: common designs are pressurized glycol, drain back, batch systems and newer low pressure freeze tolerant systems using polymer pipes containing water with photovoltaic pumping. European and International standards are being reviewed to accommodate innovations in design and operation of medium temperature collectors. Operational innovations include &quot;permanently wetted collector&quot; operation. This innovation reduces or even eliminates the occurrence of no-flow high temperature stresses called stagnation which would otherwise reduce the life expectancy of collectors.

=== Solar drying ===
Solar thermal energy can be useful for drying wood for construction and wood fuels such as wood chips for combustion. Solar is also used for food products such as fruits, grains, and fish. Crop drying by solar means is environmentally friendly as well as cost effective while improving the quality. The less money it takes to make a product, the less it can be sold for, pleasing both the buyers and the sellers. Technologies in solar drying include ultra low cost pumped transpired plate air collectors based on black fabrics. Solar thermal energy is helpful in the process of drying products such as wood chips and other forms of biomass by raising the temperature while allowing air to pass through and get rid of the moisture.

=== Cooking ===

Solar cookers use sunlight for cooking, drying and pasteurization. Solar cooking offsets fuel costs, reduces demand for fuel or firewood, and improves air quality by reducing or removing a source of smoke.

The simplest type of solar cooker is the box cooker first built by Horace de Saussure in 1767. A basic box cooker consists of an insulated container with a transparent lid. These cookers can be used effectively with partially overcast skies and will typically reach temperatures of 50–100 °C (100–200 °F).

Concentrating solar cookers use reflectors to concentrate solar energy onto a cooking container. The most common reflector geometries are flat plate, disc and parabolic trough type. These designs cook faster and at higher temperatures (up to 350 °C; 660 °F) but require direct light to function properly.

The Solar Kitchen in Auroville, India uses a unique concentrating technology known as the solar bowl. Contrary to conventional tracking reflector/fixed receiver systems, the solar bowl uses a fixed spherical reflector with a receiver which tracks the focus of light as the Sun moves across the sky. The solar bowl&#x27;s receiver reaches temperature of 150 °C (300 °F) that is used to produce steam that helps cook 2,000 daily meals.

Many other solar kitchens in India use another unique concentrating technology known as the Scheffler reflector. This technology was first developed by Wolfgang Scheffler in 1986. A Scheffler reflector is a parabolic dish that uses single axis tracking to follow the Sun&#x27;s daily course. These reflectors have a flexible reflective surface that is able to change its curvature to adjust to seasonal variations in the incident angle of sunlight. Scheffler reflectors have the advantage of having a fixed focal point which improves the ease of cooking and are able to reach temperatures of 450-650 °C (850 °F to 1200 °F). Built in 1999 by the Brahma Kumaris, the world&#x27;s largest Scheffler reflector system in Abu Road, Rajasthan India is capable of cooking up to 35,000 meals a day. By early 2008, over 2000 large cookers of the Scheffler design had been built worldwide.

=== Distillation ===

Solar stills can be used to make drinking water in areas where clean water is not common. Solar distillation is necessary in these situations to provide people with purified water. Solar energy heats up the water in the still. The water then evaporates and condenses on the bottom of the covering glass.

=== Surgical autoclave steriliser ===
Dr Lin Zhao of MIT published a peer-reviewed academic journal in Joule detailing their design for a solar autoclave for the sterilisation of surgical instruments without electricity.

A prototype, which incorporates inexpensive aerogel was successfully demonstrated at a hospital in Mumbai in conjunction with IIT Bombay, Indian Institute of Technology.

== High-temperature collectors ==


Where temperatures below about 95 °C (200 °F) are sufficient, as for space heating, flat-plate collectors of the nonconcentrating type are generally used. Because of the relatively high heat losses through the glazing, flat plate collectors will not reach temperatures much above 200 °C (400 °F) even when the heat transfer fluid is stagnant. Such temperatures are too low for efficient conversion to electricity.

The efficiency of heat engines increases with the temperature of the heat source. To achieve this in solar thermal energy plants, solar radiation is concentrated by mirrors or lenses to obtain higher temperatures – a technique called Concentrated Solar Power (CSP). The practical effect of high efficiencies is to reduce the plant&#x27;s collector size and total land use per unit power generated, reducing the environmental impacts of a power plant as well as its expense.

As the temperature increases, different forms of conversion become practical. Up to 600 °C (1100 °F), steam turbines, standard technology, have an efficiency up to 41%. Above 600 °C (1100 °F), gas turbines can be more efficient. Higher temperatures are problematic because different materials and techniques are needed. One proposal for very high temperatures is to use liquid fluoride salts operating between 700 °C (1300 °F) to 800 °C (1500 °F), using multi-stage turbine systems to achieve 50% or more thermal efficiencies. The higher operating temperatures permit the plant to use higher-temperature dry heat exchangers for its thermal exhaust, reducing the plant&#x27;s water use – critical in the deserts where large solar plants are practical. High temperatures also make heat storage more efficient, because more watt-hours are stored per unit of fluid.

Commercial concentrating solar thermal power (CSP) plants were first developed in the 1980s. The world&#x27;s largest solar thermal power plants are now the 370 MW Ivanpah Solar Power Facility, commissioned in 2014, and the 354 MW SEGS CSP installation, both located in the Mojave Desert of California, where several other solar projects have been realized as well.

The principal advantage of CSP is the ability to efficiently add thermal storage, allowing the dispatching of electricity over up to a 24-hour period. Since peak electricity demand typically occurs between about 4 and 8 pm, many CSP power plants use 3 to 5 hours of thermal storage. With current technology, storage of heat is much cheaper and more efficient than storage of electricity. In this way, the CSP plant can produce electricity day and night. If the CSP site has predictable solar radiation, then the CSP plant becomes a reliable power plant. Reliability can further be improved by installing a back-up combustion system. The back-up system can use most of the CSP plant, which decreases the cost of the back-up system.

With reliability, unused desert, no pollution, and no fuel costs, the obstacles for large deployment for CSP are cost, aesthetics, land use and similar factors for the necessary connecting high tension lines. Although only a small percentage of the desert is necessary to meet global electricity demand, still a large area must be covered with mirrors or lenses to obtain a significant amount of energy. An important way to decrease cost is the use of a simple design.

When considering land use impacts associated with the exploration and extraction through to transportation and conversion of fossil fuels, which are used for most of our electrical power, utility-scale solar power compares as one of the most land-efficient energy resources available:

The federal government has dedicated nearly 2,000 times more acreage to oil and gas leases than to solar development. In 2010 the Bureau of Land Management approved nine large-scale solar projects, with a total generating capacity of 3,682 megawatts, representing approximately 40,000 acres. In contrast, in 2010, the Bureau of Land Management processed more than 5,200 applications gas and oil leases, and issued 1,308 leases, for a total of 3.2 million acres. Currently, 38.2 million acres of onshore public lands and an additional 36.9 million acres of offshore exploration in the Gulf of Mexico are under lease for oil and gas development, exploration and production.

=== System designs ===
During the day the sun has different positions. For low concentration systems (and low temperatures) tracking can be avoided (or limited to a few positions per year) if nonimaging optics are used. For higher concentrations, however, if the mirrors or lenses do not move, then the focus of the mirrors or lenses changes. A tracking system that follows the position of the sun is required. The tracking system increases the cost and complexity. With this in mind, different designs can be distinguished in how they concentrate the light and track the position of the sun.

==== Parabolic trough designs ====


Parabolic trough power plants use a curved, mirrored trough which reflects the direct solar radiation onto a glass tube containing a fluid (also called a receiver, absorber or collector) running the length of the trough, positioned at the focal point of the reflectors. The trough is parabolic along one axis and linear in the orthogonal axis. For change of the daily position of the sun perpendicular to the receiver, the trough tilts east to west so that the direct radiation remains focused on the receiver. However, seasonal changes in the angle of sunlight parallel to the trough does not require adjustment of the mirrors, since the light is simply concentrated elsewhere on the receiver. Thus the trough design does not require tracking on a second axis. The receiver may be enclosed in a glass vacuum chamber. The vacuum significantly reduces convective heat loss.

A fluid (also called heat transfer fluid) passes through the receiver and becomes very hot. Common fluids are synthetic oil, molten salt and pressurized steam. The fluid containing the heat is transported to a heat engine where about a third of the heat is converted to electricity.

Full-scale parabolic trough systems consist of many such troughs laid out in parallel over a large area of land. Since 1985 a solar thermal system using this principle has been in full operation in California in the United States. It is called the Solar Energy Generating Systems (SEGS) system. Other CSP designs lack this kind of long experience and therefore it can currently be said that the parabolic trough design is the most thoroughly proven CSP technology.

The SEGS is a collection of nine plants with a total capacity of 354 MW and has been the world&#x27;s largest solar power plant, both thermal and non-thermal, for many years. A newer plant is Nevada Solar One plant with a capacity of 64 MW. The 150 MW Andasol solar power stations are in Spain with each site having a capacity of 50 MW. Note however, that those plants have heat storage which requires a larger field of solar collectors relative to the size of the steam turbine-generator to store heat and send heat to the steam turbine at the same time. Heat storage enables better utilization of the steam turbine. With day and some nighttime operation of the steam-turbine Andasol 1 at 50 MW peak capacity produces more energy than Nevada Solar One at 64 MW peak capacity, due to the former plant&#x27;s thermal energy storage system and larger solar field. The 280 MW Solana Generating Station came online in Arizona in 2013 with 6 hours of power storage. Hassi R&#x27;Mel integrated solar combined cycle power station in Algeria and Martin Next Generation Solar Energy Center both use parabolic troughs in a combined cycle with natural gas.

==== Enclosed trough ====

The enclosed trough architecture encapsulates the solar thermal system within a greenhouse-like glasshouse. The glasshouse creates a protected environment to withstand the elements that can negatively impact reliability and efficiency of the solar thermal system.

Lightweight curved solar-reflecting mirrors are suspended within the glasshouse structure. A single-axis tracking system positions the mirrors to track the sun and focus its light onto a network of stationary steel pipes, also suspended from the glasshouse structure. Steam is generated directly, using oil field-quality water, as water flows from the inlet throughout the length of the pipes, without heat exchangers or intermediate working fluids.

The steam produced is then fed directly to the field&#x27;s existing steam distribution network, where the steam is continuously injected deep into the oil reservoir. Sheltering the mirrors from the wind allows them to achieve higher temperature rates and prevents dust from building up as a result from exposure to humidity. GlassPoint Solar, the company that created the Enclosed Trough design, states its technology can produce heat for EOR for about $5 per million British thermal units in sunny regions, compared to between $10 and $12 for other conventional solar thermal technologies.

GlassPoint&#x27;s enclosed trough system has been utilized at the Miraah facility in Oman, and a new project has recently been announced for the company to bring its enclosed trough technology to the South Belridge Oil Field, near Bakersfield, California.

==== Power tower designs ====

Power towers (also known as &#x27;central tower&#x27; power plants or &#x27;heliostat&#x27; power plants) capture and focus the sun&#x27;s thermal energy with thousands of tracking mirrors (called heliostats) in roughly a two square mile field. A tower resides in the center of the heliostat field. The heliostats focus concentrated sunlight on a receiver which sits on top of the tower. Within the receiver the concentrated sunlight heats molten salt to over . The heated molten salt then flows into a thermal storage tank where it is stored, maintaining 98% thermal efficiency, and eventually pumped to a steam generator. The steam drives a standard turbine to generate electricity. This process, also known as the &quot;Rankine cycle&quot; is similar to a standard coal-fired power plant, except it is fueled by solar energy.

The advantage of this design above the parabolic trough design is the higher temperature. Thermal energy at higher temperatures can be converted to electricity more efficiently and can be more cheaply stored for later use. Furthermore, there is less need to flatten the ground area. In principle a power tower can be built on the side of a hill. Mirrors can be flat and plumbing is concentrated in the tower. The disadvantage is that each mirror must have its own dual-axis control, while in the parabolic trough design single axis tracking can be shared for a large array of mirrors.

A cost/performance comparison between power tower and parabolic trough concentrators was made by the NREL which estimated that by 2020 electricity could be produced from power towers for 5.47 ¢/kWh and for 6.21 ¢/kWh from parabolic troughs. The capacity factor for power towers was estimated to be 72.9% and 56.2% for parabolic troughs. There is some hope that the development of cheap, durable, mass producible heliostat power plant components could bring this cost down.

The first commercial tower power plant was PS10 in Spain with a capacity of 11 MW, completed in 2007. Since then a number of plants have been proposed, several have been built in a number of countries (Spain, Germany, U.S., Turkey, China, India) but several proposed plants were cancelled as photovoltaic solar prices plummeted. A solar power tower went online in South Africa in 2016. Ivanpah Solar Power Facility in California generates 392 MW of electricity from three towers, making it the largest solar power tower plant when it came online in late 2013.

==== Dish designs ====

A dish Stirling system uses a large, reflective, parabolic dish (similar in shape to a satellite television dish). It focuses all the sunlight that strikes the dish up onto a single point above the dish, where a receiver captures the heat and transforms it into a useful form. Typically the dish is coupled with a Stirling engine in a Dish-Stirling System, but also sometimes a steam engine is used. These create rotational kinetic energy that can be converted to electricity using an electric generator.

In 2005 Southern California Edison announced an agreement to purchase solar powered Stirling engines from Stirling Energy Systems over a twenty-year period and in quantities (20,000 units) sufficient to generate 500 megawatts of electricity. In January 2010, Stirling Energy Systems and Tessera Solar commissioned the first demonstration 1.5-megawatt power plant (&quot;Maricopa Solar&quot;) using Stirling technology in Peoria, Arizona. At the beginning of 2011 Stirling Energy&#x27;s development arm, Tessera Solar, sold off its two large projects, the 709 MW Imperial project and the 850 MW Calico project to AES Solar and K.Road, respectively. In 2012 the Maricopa plant was bought and dismantled by United Sun Systems. United Sun Systems released a new generation system, based on a V-shaped Stirling engine and a peak production of 33 kW. The new CSP-Stirling technology brings down LCOE to USD 0.02 in utility scale.

According to its developer, Rispasso Energy, a Swedish firm, in 2015 its Dish Sterling system being tested in the Kalahari Desert in South Africa showed 34% efficiency.

==== Fresnel technologies ====

A linear Fresnel reflector power plant uses a series of long, narrow, shallow-curvature (or even flat) mirrors to focus light onto one or more linear receivers positioned above the mirrors. On top of the receiver a small parabolic mirror can be attached for further focusing the light. These systems aim to offer lower overall costs by sharing a receiver between several mirrors (as compared with trough and dish concepts), while still using the simple line-focus geometry with one axis for tracking. This is similar to the trough design (and different from central towers and dishes with dual-axis). The receiver is stationary and so fluid couplings are not required (as in troughs and dishes). The mirrors also do not need to support the receiver, so they are structurally simpler. When suitable aiming strategies are used (mirrors aimed at different receivers at different times of day), this can allow a denser packing of mirrors on available land area.

Rival single axis tracking technologies include the relatively new linear Fresnel reflector (LFR) and compact-LFR (CLFR) technologies. The LFR differs from that of the parabolic trough in that the absorber is fixed in space above the mirror field. Also, the reflector is composed of many low row segments, which focus collectively on an elevated long tower receiver running parallel to the reflector rotational axis.

Prototypes of Fresnel lens concentrators have been produced for the collection of thermal energy by International Automated Systems. No full-scale thermal systems using Fresnel lenses are known to be in operation, although products incorporating Fresnel lenses in conjunction with photovoltaic cells are already available.

==== MicroCSP ====
MicroCSP is used for community-sized power plants (1 MW to 50 MW), for industrial, agricultural and manufacturing &#x27;process heat&#x27; applications, and when large amounts of hot water are needed, such as resort swimming pools, water parks, large laundry facilities, sterilization, distillation and other such uses.

== Heat collection and exchange ==
Heat in a solar thermal system is guided by five basic principles: heat gain; heat transfer; heat storage; heat transport; and heat insulation. Here, heat is the measure of the amount of thermal energy an object contains and is determined by the temperature, mass and specific heat of the object. Solar thermal power plants use heat exchangers that are designed for constant working conditions, to provide heat exchange. Copper heat exchangers are important in solar thermal heating and cooling systems because of copper&#x27;s high thermal conductivity, resistance to atmospheric and water corrosion, sealing and joining by soldering, and mechanical strength. Copper is used both in receivers and in primary circuits (pipes and heat exchangers for water tanks) of solar thermal water systems.

Heat gain is the heat accumulated from the sun in the system. Solar thermal heat is trapped using the greenhouse effect; the greenhouse effect in this case is the ability of a reflective surface to transmit short wave radiation and reflect long wave radiation. Heat and infrared radiation (IR) are produced when short wave radiation light hits the absorber plate, which is then trapped inside the collector. Fluid, usually water, in the absorber tubes collect the trapped heat and transfer it to a heat storage vault.

Heat is transferred either by conduction or convection. When water is heated, kinetic energy is transferred by conduction to water molecules throughout the medium. These molecules spread their thermal energy by conduction and occupy more space than the cold slow moving molecules above them. The distribution of energy from the rising hot water to the sinking cold water contributes to the convection process. Heat is transferred from the absorber plates of the collector in the fluid by conduction. The collector fluid is circulated through the carrier pipes to the heat transfer vault. Inside the vault, heat is transferred throughout the medium through convection.

Heat storage enables solar thermal plants to produce electricity during hours without sunlight. Heat is transferred to a thermal storage medium in an insulated reservoir during hours with sunlight, and is withdrawn for power generation during hours lacking sunlight. Thermal storage mediums will be discussed in a heat storage section. Rate of heat transfer is related to the conductive and convection medium as well as the temperature differences. Bodies with large temperature differences transfer heat faster than bodies with lower temperature differences.

Heat transport refers to the activity in which heat from a solar collector is transported to the heat storage vault. Heat insulation is vital in both heat transport tubing as well as the storage vault. It prevents heat loss, which in turn relates to energy loss, or decrease in the efficiency of the system.

== Heat storage for electric base loads ==

Heat storage allows a solar thermal plant to produce electricity at night and on overcast days. This allows the use of solar power for baseload generation as well as peak power generation, with the potential of displacing both coal- and natural gas-fired power plants. Additionally, the utilization of the generator is higher which reduces cost. Even short term storage can help by smoothing out the &quot;duck curve&quot; of rapid change in generation requirements at sunset when a grid includes large amounts of solar capacity.

Heat is transferred to a thermal storage medium in an insulated reservoir during the day, and withdrawn for power generation at night. Thermal storage media include pressurized steam, concrete, a variety of phase change materials, and molten salts such as calcium, sodium and potassium nitrate.

=== Steam accumulator ===
The PS10 solar power tower stores heat in tanks as pressurized steam at 50 bar (700 psi) and 285 °C (545 °F). The steam condenses and flashes back to steam, when pressure is lowered. Storage is for one hour. It is suggested that longer storage is possible, but that has not been proven in an existing power plant.

=== Molten salt storage ===

Molten salt is used to transport heat in solar power tower systems because it is liquid at atmospheric pressure, provides a low-cost medium to store thermal energy, its operating temperatures are compatible with today&#x27;s steam turbines, and it is non-flammable and nontoxic. Molten salt is also used in the chemical and metals industries to transport heat.

The first commercial molten salt mixture was a common form of saltpeter, 60% sodium nitrate and 40% potassium nitrate. Saltpeter melts at 220 °C (430 °F) and is kept liquid at 290 °C (550 °F) in an insulated storage tank. Calcium nitrate can reduce the melting point to 131 °C (268 °F), permitting more energy to be extracted before the salt freezes. There are now several technical calcium nitrate grades stable at more than 500 °C (1000 °F).

This solar power system can generate power in cloudy weather or at night using the heat in the tank of hot salt. The tanks are insulated, able to store heat for a week. Tanks that power a 100-megawatt turbine for four hours would be about 9 m (30 ft) tall and 24 m (80 ft) in diameter.

The Andasol power plant in Spain is the first commercial solar thermal power plant using molten salt for heat storage and nighttime generation. It came on line March 2009. On July 4, 2011, a company in Spain celebrated an historic moment for the solar industry: Torresol&#x27;s 19.9 MW concentrating solar power plant became the first ever to generate uninterrupted electricity for 24 hours straight, using a molten salt heat storage.

In January 2019 Shouhang Energy Saving Dunhuang 100MW molten salt tower solar energy photothermal power station project was connected to grid and started operating. Its configuration includes an 11-hour molten salt heat storage system and can generate power consecutively for 24 hours.

=== Phase-change materials for storage ===
Phase Change Material (PCMs) offer an alternative solution in energy storage. Using a similar heat transfer infrastructure, PCMs have the potential of providing a more efficient means of storage. PCMs can be either organic or inorganic materials. Advantages of organic PCMs include no corrosives, low or no undercooling, and chemical and thermal stability. Disadvantages include low phase-change enthalpy, low thermal conductivity, and flammability. Inorganics are advantageous with greater phase-change enthalpy, but exhibit disadvantages with undercooling, corrosion, phase separation, and lack of thermal stability. The greater phase-change enthalpy in inorganic PCMs make hydrate salts a strong candidate in the solar energy storage field.

== Use of water ==
A design which requires water for condensation or cooling may conflict with location of solar thermal plants in desert areas with good solar radiation but limited water resources. The conflict is illustrated by plans of Solar Millennium, a German company, to build a plant in the Amargosa Valley of Nevada which would require 20% of the water available in the area. Some other projected plants by the same and other companies in the Mojave Desert of California may also be affected by difficulty in obtaining adequate and appropriate water rights. California water law currently prohibits use of potable water for cooling.

Other designs require less water. The Ivanpah Solar Power Facility in south-eastern California conserves scarce desert water by using air-cooling to convert the steam back into water. Compared to conventional wet-cooling, this results in a 90% reduction in water usage at the cost of some loss of efficiency. The water is then returned to the boiler in a closed process which is environmentally friendly.

== Electrical conversion efficiency ==
Of all of these technologies the solar dish/Stirling engine has the highest energy efficiency. A single solar dish-Stirling engine installed at Sandia National Laboratories National Solar Thermal Test Facility (NSTTF) produces as much as 25 kW of electricity, with a conversion efficiency of 31.25%.

Solar parabolic trough plants have been built with efficiencies of about 20%. Fresnel reflectors have a slightly lower efficiency (but this is compensated by the denser packing).

The gross conversion efficiencies (taking into account that the solar dishes or troughs occupy only a fraction of the total area of the power plant) are determined by net generating capacity over the solar energy that falls on the total area of the solar plant. The 500-megawatt (MW) SCE/SES plant would extract about 2.75% of the radiation (1 kW/m2; see &quot;&quot; for a discussion) that falls on its 4,500 acres (18.2 km2). For the 50 MW AndaSol Power Plant that is being built in Spain (total area 1.95 km2; sq. mi.) gross conversion efficiency comes out at 2.6%.

Efficiency does not directly relate to cost: total cost includes the cost of construction and maintenance.

<text>Tidewater Oil Company (rendered as Tide Water Oil Company from 1887 to 1936) was a major petroleum refining company during the early 20th century. After operating independently from 1887 to 1926, Tidewater was sold to a holding company. Over the decades, it passed through various corporate hands. Its various commercial brands for selling petroleum and gasoline products / fuel included Tydol, Flying A, and Veedol. 

In 2011, Veedol was sold by British Petroleum to Tidewater India. Now it is part of Andrew Yule and Company&#x27;s Indian group and manufactures automotive oil for the Indian market on the sub-continent of South Asia. Tidewater does not have its own refinery, so it is dependent on base oil suppliers like HPCL and BPCL. It also manufactures a wide range of automotive lubricants. Its corporate headquarters is in Los Angeles, California.

== History ==

Tide Water was founded in New York City in 1887. The company entered the gasoline market and by 1920 was selling gasoline, oil and other products on the East Coast of the United States under its &quot;Tydol&quot; brand. 

In 1926, control of Tide Water Oil was sold to a new holding company, Tide Water Associated Oil Company, which also acquired a controlling interest in California’s Associated Oil Company. Soon thereafter, Standard Oil Company of New Jersey took control of the company. &quot;Flying A&quot; became the primary brand name for the company, though the Tydol and Associated names were also retained in their respective marketing areas.

Tidewater Oil Company operated a fleet of oil tankers. During World War II, it chartered ships to the Maritime Commission and War Shipping Administration and operated T2 tankers to support the war effort. Ships included: USS &quot;Guyandot&quot; (AOG-16), SS &quot;Byron D. Benson&quot;, SS Samuel Q. Brown, Falls of Clyde, and others.

During the 1950s, the Associated and Tydol brands gradually fell into disuse, and were dropped entirely in 1956. 

In 1966, Phillips Petroleum Company (now ConocoPhillips) purchased Tidewater&#x27;s western refining, distribution and retailing network. Phillips immediately rebranded all Flying A stations in the region to Phillips 66. On the East Coast that year, American-born British petrol-industrialist J. Paul Getty merged his numerous oil interests into Getty Oil Company, and Tidewater Oil was dropped as a corporate brand. The Flying A brand continued to be used on the East Coast until 1970, when stations and products were renamed Getty.

In 2000, BP acquired the Veedol brand when it bought Burmah-Castrol. In February 2011, BP offered to sell the Veedol brand, which was purchased that October by Tide Water India, part of the Andrew Yule and Company Indian subsidiary.

<text>Stella Maria Sarah Miles Franklin (14 October 187919 September 1954), known as Miles Franklin, was an Australian writer and feminist who is best known for her novel &quot;My Brilliant Career&quot;, published by Blackwoods of Edinburgh in 1901. While she wrote throughout her life, her other major literary success, &quot;All That Swagger&quot;, was not published until 1936.

She was committed to the development of a uniquely Australian form of literature, and she actively pursued this goal by supporting writers, literary journals, and writers&#x27; organisations. She has had a long-lasting impact on Australian literary life through her endowment of a major annual prize for literature about &quot;Australian Life in any of its phases&quot;, the Miles Franklin Award. Her impact was further recognised in 2013 with the creation of the Stella Prize, awarded annually for the best work of literature by an Australian woman.

==Life and career==

Franklin was born at Talbingo, New South Wales, and grew up in the Brindabella Valley on a property called Brindabella Station. She was the eldest child of Australian-born parents, John Maurice Franklin and Susannah Margaret Eleanor Franklin, née Lampe, who was the great-granddaughter of Edward Miles (or Moyle) who had arrived with the First Fleet in the &quot;Scarborough&quot; with a seven-year sentence for theft. Her family was a member of the squattocracy. She was educated at home until 1889 when she attended Thornford Public. During this period she was encouraged in her writing by her teacher, Mary Gillespie (1856–1938) and Tom Hebblewhite (1857–1923) editor of the local Goulburn newspaper.

Her best known novel, &quot;My Brilliant Career&quot;, tells the story of an irrepressible teenage girl, Sybylla Melvyn, growing to womanhood in rural New South Wales. It was published in 1901 with the support of Australian writer, Henry Lawson. After its publication, Franklin tried a career in nursing, and then as a housemaid in Sydney and Melbourne. Whilst doing this she contributed pieces to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; under the pseudonyms &quot;An Old Bachelor&quot; and &quot;Vernacular.&quot; During this period she wrote &quot;My Career Goes Bung&quot; in which Sybylla encounters the Sydney literary set, but it was not released to the public until 1946. An overtly anti-war play, &quot;The Dead Must Not Return&quot;, was not published or performed but received a public reading in September 2009.

===In the United States and England===

In 1906, Franklin moved to the US and undertook secretarial work for Alice Henry, another Australian, at the National Women&#x27;s Trade Union League in Chicago, and co-edited the league&#x27;s magazine, &quot;Life and Labor&quot;. Her years in the US are reflected in &quot;On Dearborn Street&quot; (not published until 1981), a love story that uses American slang in a manner not dissimilar to the early work of Dashiell Hammett. Also while in America she wrote &quot;Some Everyday Folk and Dawn&quot; (1909), the story of a small-town Australian family, which uses purple prose for deliberate comic effect. She suffered regular bouts of ill health and entered a sanatorium for a period in 1912 
In 1915, she travelled to England and worked as a cook and earned some money from journalism. In March 1917 Franklin volunteered for war work in the Ostrovo Unit of the Scottish Women&#x27;s Hospitals during the Serbian campaigns of 1917–18. She served as a cook and later matron&#x27;s orderly in a 200-bed tent hospital attached to the Serbian army near Lake Ostrovo in Macedonian Greece from July 1917 to February 1918.

From 1919 to 1926 Franklin worked as Secretary with the National Housing and Town Planning Association in London. She organised a women&#x27;s international housing convention in 1924. Her life in England in the 1920s gave rise to &quot;Bring the Monkey&quot; (1933), a satire on the English country house mystery novel. The book reveals Franklin&#x27;s views on nationality and class. The book was a literary and commercial failure.

===Return to Australia===

Franklin resettled in Australia in 1932 after the death of her father in 1931. During that decade she wrote several historical novels of the Australian bush, most of which were published under the pseudonym &quot;Brent of Bin Bin&quot;. New South Wales State Librarian, Dagmar Schmidmaier, said &quot;Miles increasingly feared that nothing she wrote matched the success of &quot;My Brilliant Career&quot; and resorted to writing under different names, including the pseudonym Brent of Bin Bin, to protect herself from poor reviews.&quot; However, &quot;All That Swagger&quot; was published under her own name in 1936, winning the S. H. Prior Memorial Prize. Franklin also won the S. H. Prior Memorial Prize in 1939 together with Kate Baker for their collaborative work &#x27;Who Was Joseph Furphy?&#x27;.

Throughout her life, Franklin actively supported Australian literature. She joined the Fellowship of Australian Writers in 1933 and the Sydney PEN Club in 1935. She encouraged young writers such as Jean Devanny, Sumner Locke Elliott and Ric Throssell and she supported the new literary journals, &quot;Meanjin&quot; and &quot;Southerly&quot;. 
Miles entertained literary figures at her home in Carlton, NSW. An autograph book known as Miles Franklin&#x27;s Waratah Book held by the State Library of NSW was used for autographs and inscriptions. Guests were encouraged to drink tea from the Waratah Cup and to write in the Waratah Book. 

In 1937, Franklin declined appointment as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire.

In this period of her life Franklin was a constant attendee and speaker at various cultural and literary events. Her message was centred on free speech and the championing of Australian literature. Franklin was not a member of any political party, although her diaries reveal an interest in socialism and ASIO did have a file on Franklin during the Cold War. Franklin&#x27;s literary friend P.R. (&#x27;Inky&#x27;) Stephenson launched the pro-isolationist, anti-war Australia First Movement in late 1941, to which Franklin was vehemently opposed, as evidenced by her diary entries and correspondence at the time - &quot;Reds or pinks or &#x27;rightists&#x27; all showed their ignorance&quot; she wrote after attending a AFM meeting, and of Stephenson &quot;I could not have anything to do with his politics&quot;. Franklin was staunchly anti-war and, traumatized by her WWI experiences, very much feared a war on Australian soil at this time.

While Miles Franklin had many suitors, she never married. She died on 19 September 1954, aged 74 and her ashes were scattered in Jounama Creek, Talbingo close to where she was born.

==Collaborations==
Miles Franklin engaged in a number of literary collaborations throughout her life. In addition to co-editing the journal &quot;Life and Labor&quot; with Alice Henry in the US, she also wrote &quot;Pioneers on Parade&quot; in collaboration with Dymphna Cusack and a biography of Joseph Furphy (1944) &quot;in painful collaboration with Kate Baker&quot;. Previously, in 1939, she and Baker had won the Prior Memorial prize for an essay on Furphy.

Dever writes that the letters between Dymphna Cusack and Miles Franklin that are published in &quot;Yarn Spinners&quot; &quot;provide a see-sawing commentary on the delicate art of literary collaboration&quot;.

==Legacy==

In her will she made a bequest for her estate to establish an annual literary award known as The Miles Franklin Award. The first winner was Patrick White with &quot;Voss&quot; in 1957.

The Canberra suburb of Franklin and the nearby primary school Miles Franklin Primary School are named in her honour. The school holds an annual writing competition in her memory. Additionally the Franklin Public School in Tumut, NSW is also named in her honour.

During her lifetime Miles Franklin donated several items to the Mitchell Library. Manuscript material was presented over the period 1937–1942. The various drafts of &quot;Pioneers on Parade&quot; were presented in 1940. She bequeathed her printed book collection, correspondence and notes as well as the poems of Mary Fullerton. 47 of Miles Franklin&#x27;s diaries are in the State Library of New South Wales, including one copy discovered in 2018.

A revival of interest in Franklin occurred in the wake of the Australian New Wave film &quot;My Brilliant Career&quot; (1979), which won several international awards.

In 2014, Google Doodle celebrated her 135th birthday.

In her 2022 novel, &quot;Salonika Burning&quot;, The Australian writer Gail Jones fictionalises Miles Franklin (as &#x27;Stella&#x27;), and her experiences in Macedonia, as a central character, along with British painters Grace Pailthorpe and Stanley Spencer, and Australian adventurer Olive King.

<doc id="413095" wikidata="Q1053983" url="?curid=413095" title="Hope &amp; Faith">
<text>Hope &amp; Faith is an American television sitcom, starring Faith Ford and Kelly Ripa as Hope Shanowski and Faith Fairfield, respectively. Hope is a homemaker and mother of three and Faith is her sister, a washed up soap opera star whose character is killed off, leading her to move in with Hope and her family in the fictional suburban Cleveland town of Glen Falls, Ohio. It originally aired on ABC from September 26, 2003, to May 2, 2006. During its first and second seasons, the series was part of the revived TGIF comedy block.

&quot;Hope &amp; Faith&quot; was created and produced by Joanna Johnson, who loosely based the premise on her own life as a former cast member of &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;. The series was primarily filmed at New York City&#x27;s Silvercup East, a sister studio to Silvercup Studios. In May 2006, ABC announced that &quot;Hope &amp; Faith&quot; had been cancelled after three seasons.

==History==
ABC announced on January 18, 2006, that it was benching &quot;Hope &amp; Faith&quot; for the February sweeps to make room for an expanded edition of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. The show began to air its remaining episodes from March 21, 2006, on Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m. ET against &quot;American Idol&quot;. In May 2006, ABC announced that the show would be cancelled when it unveiled its fall 2006 line up.

==Main characters==
* Hope Shanowski née Fairfield (Faith Ford). Hope is usually the most sensible one, and is always reluctant to go along with her sister&#x27;s schemes. She is married to Charlie and has three kids, Sydney, Hayley, and Justin. She likes to bake and garden, and eventually has her own catering business.
* Faith Fairfield (Kelly Ripa). Faith is Hope&#x27;s younger dim-witted celebrity sister. She was on &quot;Star Search&quot;, and starred as Ashley Storm (a character who had an evil twin named Angela) on the fictional soap opera &quot;The Sacred and the Sinful&quot;. Faith is lazy and makes Hope wait on her. She always hatches schemes and manages to involve her sister in them. She makes repeated attempts to get more acting work but is never successful. In season two, one of Faith&#x27;s schemes involved her and Hope&#x27;s creating a catering business: as a result, Faith ended up becoming a professional caterer. She also claimed to have invented the idea of the internet, stating she &quot;has the sketches.&quot;
* Charlie Shanowski (Ted McGinley; Josh Stamberg, unaired pilot). Charlie is Hope&#x27;s husband and patriarch of the family. He dislikes Faith, and is always trying to get her to leave. He is an orthodontist. He likes watching sports and is a fan of Faith&#x27;s former baseball playing boyfriend The Gooch.
* Sydney Shanowski (Nicole Paggi, season 1; Megan Fox, season 2–3; Brie Larson, unaired pilot). Sydney is Hope and Charlie&#x27;s elder daughter. She particularly likes spending time with her aunt Faith, whom she sees as way cooler than her mother and gets sucked into Faith&#x27;s schemes. She is portrayed as popular, vain, boy crazy, mean and kind of ditzy. Paggi&#x27;s version was fairly wholesome but Fox&#x27;s version was more promiscuous.
* Hayley Shanowski (Macey Cruthird). Hayley is Hope and Charlie&#x27;s younger daughter. She is portrayed as the smart child who gets promoted to high school in season two. She is also caring and an animal activist. Sometimes she belittles her older sister because Hayley is smarter than her. She eventually becomes Edwin&#x27;s girlfriend.
* Justin Shanowski (Paulie Litt; Jansen Panettiere, pilot episode only; Slade Pearce, unaired pilot). Justin is Hope and Charlie&#x27;s only son. He is smart and is known to act like an adult with his mature interests (such as Frank Sinatra). He usually pals around with his dad and likes his aunt.

===Recurring characters===
* Jack Fairfield (Robert Wagner, Harve Presnell, unaired pilot). Jack is Hope and Faith&#x27;s father and ever since his wife (Hope and Faith&#x27;s mother) Mary Jo died, he has dated women half his age. The reason he married Hope and Faith&#x27;s mother is because she was pregnant with Hope. He also had an affair with another woman when his marriage with Mary Jo was on the rocks and had an illegitimate son named Jay.
* Gary &quot;The Gooch&quot; Gucharez (Mark Consuelos). The Gooch is a baseball player, who was a former hot-shot major league baseball player who ruined his career by failing to catch a slow moving ball. Upon meeting, he and Faith bump heads, but the pair eventually have the hots for each other and start dating. Later on, the Gooch gets a job offer to play baseball in Japan and leaves their love behind. However, he moves back to the States in hopes of declaring his love for Faith and they eventually elope in the season three premiere. Although their marriage is short-lived, he comes back in a later episode and he and Faith re-unite.
* Edwin (Brett Murphy). Edwin plays Haley&#x27;s boyfriend. He is portrayed as a smart nerd who has many allergies and asthma. He appeared in five episodes; &quot;Hope Has No Faith&quot;, &quot;Silent Night, Opening Night&quot;, &quot;Mismatch&quot;, &quot;Faith Scare-Field&quot;, and &quot;The Gooch&quot;.
* Henry (Stark Sands). Edwin&#x27;s older brother and someone who Sydney has a crush on. Like his brother, Henry is also smart.
* Mandi Ragner (Jenny McCarthy). Mandi has been Faith&#x27;s best friend since they were in school. Mandi dates Hope and Faith&#x27;s father Jack for one episode. She comes back in a later episode and tells their father that she is pregnant with his child. He planned to marry her, but when the baby was born it was obvious it wasn&#x27;t his. She appeared in three episodes; &quot;Jack&#x27;s Back&quot;, &quot;Natal Attraction&quot;, and &quot;Stand By Your Mandi&quot;.
* Handsome Hal Halverson (Regis Philbin). Handsome Hal is a successful used car salesman. He uses celebrities and makes fools of them in his commercials. In his first episode, he makes a fool out of Faith in his commercials. In his second episode, he makes a fool out of the Gooch in his commercials. And in his final episode, he loses his car dealership and becomes broke. Faith decides to be nice and invites him to stay with them. He has a scheme for the two of them to host a morning talk show. The producers love him, but they tell him to dump Faith. He appeared in one episode each season; &quot;Car Commercial&quot;, &quot;Another Car Commercial&quot;, and &quot;Homeless Hal&quot;.
* Nancy Lombard (Susan Sullivan). Nancy is Faith&#x27;s therapist. She helps Faith after Charlie and Hope force her to see Dr. Lombard. In one episode, she tells Faith to do something fun, which she drags Hope into. She can also be very sensible towards Faith and usually tells her the right thing to do, but can cause some backfire for both Hope and Faith. She appeared in four episodes in Season 3 &quot;Faith&#x27;s Therapy&quot;, &quot;Hope in the Middle&quot;, &quot;The Restaurant&quot;, and &quot;Old Faithful&quot;.
* Brooke Spencer (Rebecca Budig). Brooke is Faith&#x27;s replacement on The Sacred and the Sinful. Many think that Brooke is a better fit as Ashley Storm, but some still think Faith is better. She has a disliking to Faith and always tries to outstage her. At the Daytime Emmys, it is revealed that Brooke Spencer is a man and Jacqueline Karr is her mother, another famous soap star. She appears in four episodes in Season 1, which are, &quot;Silent Night, Opening Night&quot;, &quot;Trade Show&quot;, &quot;Daytime Emmy&#x27;s: Part 1&quot;, and Daytime Emmy&#x27;s: Part 2&quot;.
* Jay (Johnny Galecki). Jack Fairfield had an affair with a lady, resulting in Jay. Therefore, Jay is Hope&#x27;s and Faith&#x27;s younger half brother. Galecki appears in 3 episodes. The name of the episodes are &quot;Blood Is Thicker Than Daughter&quot;, &quot;The Restaurant&quot; and the episode &quot;Jay Date&quot;.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
&quot;Hope &amp; Faith&quot; received generally mixed reviews. On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the first season reports a 25% approval rating, based on 8 reviews. In a review for Variety, following the pilot episode, Phil Gallo criticised that it was predictable, commenting that the show is &quot;Banal and derivative, ABC’s attempt to revive the TGIF franchise hinges on the concept that every generation needs its own &quot;Family Matters&quot; or &quot;Full House&quot;; this attempt to create a recipe based on the appeal of those shows backfires so badly.&quot; He continued, &quot;Ripa and Ford are adequate, but the direction, writing and husband role are so lifeless, it would take some truly bizarre occurrences to make this at least unpredictable.&quot;

People Magazine gave the series a scathing review, and was highly critical of the pilot episode&#x27;s humor , referring to it as a &quot;terribly frantic half hour&quot;, and of Ripa, said that &quot;this comedy would have more potential if Ripa’s over-the-top character were chewing up a soap-opera set rather than running amok in a Middle American kitchen.

In a favorable review from Ken Tucker for Entertainment Weekly, he praised the show&#x27;s premise, and the performances of both Ford and Ripa, stating that the series is &quot;Loud, obvious, and crass, &quot;Hope &amp; Faith&quot; is one of this season’s more fascinating new sitcoms.&quot;

<doc id="413098" wikidata="Q613136" url="?curid=413098" title="Walter Reed">
<text>Walter Reed (September 13, 1851 – November 23, 1902) was a U.S. Army physician who in 1901 led the team that confirmed the theory of Cuban doctor Carlos Finlay that yellow fever is transmitted by a particular mosquito species rather than by direct contact. This insight gave impetus to the new fields of epidemiology and biomedicine, and most immediately allowed the resumption and completion of work on the Panama Canal (1904–1914) by the United States. Reed followed work started by Finlay and directed by George Miller Sternberg, who has been called the &quot;first U.S. bacteriologist&quot;.

==Early and family life==
Reed was born in Gloucester, Virginia, the fifth child of Lemuel Sutton Reed (a traveling Methodist minister) and his first wifey, Pharaba White. During his youth, the family resided at Murfreesboro, North Carolina with his mother&#x27;s family during his father&#x27;s preaching tours. Two of his elder brothers later achieved distinction: J.C. became a minister in Virginia like their father, and Christopher a judge in Wichita, Kansas and later St. Louis, Missouri. Their childhood home is included in the Murfreesboro Historic District.

 in December 1866, Rev. Reed remarried, to Mrs. Mary C. Byrd Kyle of Harrisonburg, Virginia, with whom he had a daughter. Young Walter enrolled at the University of Virginia. After two years, Reed completed the M.D. degree in 1869, two months before he turned 18. He was the youngest-ever recipient of an M.D. from the university.

Reed then enrolled at the New York University&#x27;s Bellevue Hospital Medical College in Manhattan, New York City, where he obtained a second M.D. in 1870, as his brother Christopher attempted to set up a legal practice. After interning at several New York City hospitals, Reed worked for the New York Board of Health until 1875.

==Personal life==
He married Emily Blackwell Lawrence (1856–1950) of North Carolina on April 26, 1876, and took her West with him. Later, Emily gave birth to a son, Walter Lawrence Reed (1877–1956) and a daughter, Emily Lawrence Reed (1883–1964). While posted at frontier camps, the couple also adopted a Native American girl named Susie.

==U.S. Army Medical Corps==
Finding his youth limited his influence, and dissatisfied with urban life, Reed joined the U.S. Army Medical Corps. This allowed him both professional opportunities and modest financial security to establish and support a family. After Reed passed a grueling thirty-hour examination in 1875, the army medical corps enlisted him as an assistant surgeon. By this time, two of his brothers were working in Kansas, and Walter soon was assigned postings in the American West. Over the next sixteen years, the Army assigned the career officer to different outposts, where he was responsible not only for American military personnel and their dependents, but also various Native American tribes, at one point looking after several hundred Apaches, including Geronimo. Reed noticed the devastation epidemics could wreak and maintained his concerns about sanitary conditions. During one of his last tours, he completed advanced coursework in pathology and bacteriology in the Johns Hopkins University Hospital Pathology Laboratory.

While stationed at Fort Robinson, Nebraska, Reed treated the ankle of Swiss immigrant Jules Sandoz, broken by a fall into a well. Reed wanted to amputate Sandoz&#x27;s foot, but Sandoz refused his consent, and Reed succeeded in saving the foot by an extensive course of treatment. A photograph of a letter from Reed to Sandoz&#x27;s father is reproduced in the first edition of &quot;Old Jules&quot;, the 1935 biography of Sandoz by his daughter Mari Sandoz.

In 1893, Reed joined the faculty of George Washington University School of Medicine &amp; Health Sciences and the newly opened Army Medical School in Washington, D.C., where he held the professorship of Bacteriology and Clinical Microscopy. In addition to his teaching responsibilities, he actively pursued medical research projects and served as the curator of the Army Medical Museum, which later became the National Museum of Health and Medicine (NMHM). These positions also allowed Reed to break free from the fringes of the medical world.

In 1896, Reed first distinguished himself as a medical investigator. He proved that yellow fever among enlisted men stationed near the Potomac River was not a result of drinking the river water. He showed officials that the enlisted men who got yellow fever had a habit of taking trails through the local swampy woods at night. Their fellow officers without yellow fever did not do so. Reed also proved that the local civilians drinking from the Potomac River had no relation to the incidence of the disease.

Reed traveled to Cuba to study diseases in U.S. Army encampments there during the Spanish–American War. Appointed chairman of a panel formed in 1898 to investigate an epidemic of typhoid fever, Reed and his colleagues showed that contact with fecal matter and food or drink contaminated by flies caused that epidemic. Yellow fever also became a problem for the Army during this time, felling thousands of soldiers in Cuba.

In May 1900, Major Reed returned to Cuba when he was appointed head of an investigative board charged by Army Surgeon General George Miller Sternberg to study tropical diseases, particularly yellow fever. Sternberg was an early expert in bacteriology during a time of great advances due to widespread acceptance of the germ theory of disease and new methods for studying microbial infections. During Reed&#x27;s leadership of the U.S. Army Yellow Fever Commission in Cuba, the Board demonstrated that yellow fever was transmitted by mosquitoes and disproved the common belief that it was transmitted by fomites (clothing and bedding soiled by the body fluids and excrement of yellow fever victims). These points were demonstrated in a dramatic series of experiments at the US Army&#x27;s Camp Lazear, named in November 1900 for Reed&#x27;s assistant and friend Jesse William Lazear, who had died of yellow fever while working on the project.

This dangerous research was done using human volunteers, including some of the medical personnel, who allowed themselves to be bitten by mosquitos infected with yellow fever. The conclusions from this research were soon applied in Panama, where mosquito eradication was largely responsible for stemming the incidence of yellow fever during the construction of the Panama Canal. Epidemics of yellow fever in Panama had confounded French attempts to build a canal across the Isthmus of Panama only 20 years earlier.

Although Reed received much of the credit for &quot;beating&quot; yellow fever, Reed himself credited Cuban medical scientist Carlos Finlay with identifying a mosquito as the vector of yellow fever and proposing how the disease might be controlled. Reed often cited Finlay in his own articles and gave him credit for the idea in his personal correspondence. The Cuban physician was a persistent advocate of the hypothesis that mosquitos were the vector of yellow fever and correctly identified the species that transmits the disease. His experiments to prove the hypothesis were discounted by many medical experts, but served as the basis for Reed&#x27;s research. More recently, the politics and ethics of using medical and military personnel as research subjects have been questioned.

Reed returned from Cuba in 1901, continuing to speak and publish on the topic of yellow fever. In recognition of his research, Reed received honorary degrees from Harvard and the University of Michigan.

In November 1902, Reed suffered a ruptured appendix. He died on November 23, 1902, of the resulting peritonitis, at age 51. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Reed&#x27;s breakthrough in yellow fever research is widely considered a milestone in biomedicine, opening new vistas of research and humanitarianism. It was largely an extension of Carlos J. Finlay&#x27;s work, carried out during the 1870s in Cuba, which finally came to prominence in 1900. Finlay was the first to theorize, in 1881, that a mosquito was a carrier, now known as a disease vector, of the organism causing yellow fever: a mosquito that bites a victim of the disease could subsequently bite and thereby infect a healthy person. He presented this theory at the 1881 International Sanitary Conference, where it was well received. A year later Finlay identified a mosquito of the genus &quot;Aedes&quot; as the organism transmitting yellow fever. His theory was followed by the recommendation to control the mosquito population as a way to control the spread of the disease.

This discovery helped William C. Gorgas reduce the incidence and prevalence of mosquito-borne diseases in Panama during the American campaign, from 1903 onwards, to construct the Panama Canal. Prior to this, about 10% of the workforce had died each year from malaria and yellow fever.

In 1912, he posthumously received what came to be known as the Walter Reed Medal in recognition of his work to combat yellow fever. A tropical medicine course is also named after him, Walter Reed Tropical Medicine Course. The National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland holds a collection of his papers regarding typhoid fever studies. Philip Showalter Hench, a Nobel Prize winner for Physiology or Medicine in 1950, maintained a long interest in Walter Reed and yellow fever. His collection of thousands of items—documents, photographs, and artifacts—is at the University of Virginia in the Philip S. Hench Walter Reed Yellow Fever Collection. More than 7,500 of these items, including several hundred letters written by Reed himself, are accessible online at the web exhibit devoted to this Collection.

In addition to that medal, course, and a stamp issued in his honor (shown), locations and institutions named after the medical pioneer include:
* Walter Reed General Hospital (WRGH), Washington, D.C. was opened on May 1, 1909, seven years after his death. It merged into the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, a new hospital complex constructed on the grounds of the National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, dedicated in 2011.
* Reed Hall at Radford College (now Radford University) was constructed in 1939 as the original home for the sciences and named for Dr. Walter Reed. It is now part of the Artis College for Science and Technology at Radford.
* Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC) opened in 1977 as the successor to WRGH and closed in 2011; it was the worldwide tertiary care medical center for the U.S. Army and was utilized by congressmen and presidents.
* Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), near Washington, D.C., is the largest biomedical research facility administered by the DoD and successor to the Army Medical School.
* Walter Reed Biosystematics Unit, operating under the direction of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research conducting research on the systematics of medically important arthropods.
* Walter Reed Birthplace, added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.
* Riverside Walter Reed Hospital in Gloucester, Virginia (near Reed&#x27;s birthplace) opened on September 13, 1977.
* Arlington County, Virginia has two facilities named for Reed: the Reed School in Westover and a community/senior center near Walter Reed Drive in Arlington Village.
* Walter Reed Middle School, North Hollywood, California is named in Reed&#x27;s honor.
* Walter Reed Army Medical Center Firefighters Washington D.C. IAFF F151
* Reed appears in sculpture on the great stone chancel screen at Riverside Church, NYC. (Section 4: &quot;Humanitarians&quot;, rather than Section 1: &quot;Physicians&quot;.)
John Miltern portrayed Reed in the 1934 Broadway play, &quot;Yellow Jack,&quot; written by Pulitzer Prize winner Sidney Howard, in collaboration with Paul de Kuif . Harcourt Brace and Co. published the play in book form, titled &quot;Yellow Jack : A History&quot;, in 1934. Lewis Stone took the part in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&#x27;s 1938 film adaptation of the play, &quot;Yellow Jack&quot;. The play and screenplay were adapted for television in episodes (both titled &quot;Yellow Jack&quot;) of &quot;Celanese Theatre&quot; (1952) and of &quot;Producers&#x27; Showcase&quot; (1955). In the latter, Reed was portrayed by Broderick Crawford.

Jeffrey Hunter played Reed in a 1962 episode of the anthology show &quot;Death Valley Days,&quot; titled &quot;Suzie&quot;. In 2006, PBS&#x27;s &quot;American Experience&quot; television series broadcast, &quot;The Great Fever&quot;, a program exploring Reed&#x27;s yellow fever campaign. The PBS website contains a great deal of additional information, including links to primary sources.

Reed&#x27;s name is featured on the frieze of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine. Twenty-three names of public health and tropical medicine pioneers were originally chosen to be displayed on the School building in Keppel Street when it was constructed in 1926.

<text>Faith Alexis Ford (born September 14, 1964) is an American actress. She played Corky Sherwood on the CBS sitcom &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;, receiving five Primetime Emmy Award nominations. She also played Hope Shanowski on the ABC sitcom &quot;Hope &amp; Faith&quot;.

==Early life==
Ford was born Faith Alexis Ford in Alexandria, Louisiana. She is the younger daughter of Patricia Walker, a schoolteacher, and Charles Ford, an insurance agent. Ford lived in nearby Pineville and began acting while attending Pineville High School. At 17, she moved to Manhattan, where she began modeling and acting.

==Career==

In 1983, Ford landed her first television role on ABC&#x27;s &quot;One Life to Live.&quot; Her first major role was playing the Julia Shearer character for several years on the NBC soap opera &quot;Another World&quot;, a role Kyra Sedgwick previously played. After the producers let her go, Ford moved to Hollywood, where she got a regular role on the short-lived sitcom &quot;The Popcorn Kid.&quot; She then had a five-episode appearance on &quot;thirtysomething&quot;, played a homeless woman on &quot;Family Ties&quot;, and joined &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;. After the series’s ten-year run, Ford pursued other TV endeavors. In 1998, she executive-produced her own short-lived sitcom, &quot;Maggie Winters&quot;. Ford also appeared on &quot;The Norm Show&quot; with Norm Macdonald, Laurie Metcalf, and Artie Lange from 1999 to 2001.

Ford starred in &quot;Hope &amp; Faith&quot; for three years with Kelly Ripa, playing Hope Fairfield-Shanowski, a homemaker living a peaceful life until her sister, a star Hollywood actress, moves in and complicates her life. 

In 2004, she published her own cookbook, &quot;Cooking with Faith&quot;, crediting her mother and two grandmothers for teaching her how to cook. In the Disney film released in early 2005, &quot;The Pacifier&quot;, Ford played the mother of a family whose husband had died. In 2007, she appeared in the sitcom &quot;Carpoolers&quot;. In June 2009, she spoke about her series and the future of digital programming at the Digital Content NewFront. In 2011, Ford appeared in the Disney teen film, &quot;Prom&quot;, playing the role of Kitty Prescott, mother of the main character Nova Prescott, played by Aimee Teegarden.

On February 26, 2018, it was announced that Ford would return to a revival of &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; with costars Candice Bergen, Joe Regalbuto, and Grant Shaud. She appeared in all 13 episodes.

==Personal life==
Ford was married to Robert Nottingham from 1989 to 1996. She has been married to writer/director Campion Murphy since 1998. Ford and Murphy coproduced an original short film entitled &quot;Citation of Merit&quot;, which appeared in numerous film festivals across the United States. 

Ford has been diagnosed with Graves&#x27; disease.

Her sister, Devon O&#x27;Day, also is in the entertainment industry, most notably in radio.
