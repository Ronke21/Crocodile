<text>Doctor Fate (also known as Fate) is the name of several superheroes appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The first version was originally created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Howard Sherman, debuting in &quot;More Fun Comics&quot; #55 (May 1940). Eight characters have served as incarnations of the character within the mainstream DC Universe, with each new version after the original attempting to reinvigorate the character for contemporary audiences.

The most well-known version of the character is Kent Nelson, the original Doctor Fate and archaeologist who was empowered by Nabu of the Lords of Order in the 20th century and was a founding member of the Justice Society of America. Having been subjected to various comic book deaths, the character has been succeeded in the role. The current version of the character, Khalid Nassour, is an Egyptian-American physician (originally a medical student) chosen by the goddess Bastet as the latest incarnation of Doctor Fate. This version is supported by Nabu, Thoth, various archangels, and Hauhet. Receiving critical acclaim, the character is often portrayed as an important member of Justice League Dark. Other versions of the character include step-mother/son duo Eric and Linda Strauss, archaeologist Inza Cramer, smuggler Jared Stevens, reincarnated son of Hawkman and Hawkgirl, Hector Hall, and former psychiatrist Kent V. Nelson.

While not reaching the same levels of iconic cultural recognition like those of Batman, Superman, or Wonder Woman, Doctor Fate remains as one of DC Comic&#x27;s most enduring and long-standing characters, known for their distinctive name and design. The character often appears as a prominent or a major supporting character in various team-based comic book titles such as the &quot;Justice Society of America&quot;, &quot;Justice League International&quot;, &quot;Justice League Dark,&quot; and has had several self-titled comic book titles.

The character has appeared in various incarnations across multiple forms of media based on both the comics and original characters; the Kent Nelson version notably appeared in the television series &quot;Smallville&quot;, in which he was portrayed by Brent Stait, and the DC Extended Universe film &quot;Black Adam&quot;, in which he was portrayed by Pierce Brosnan. The Khalid Nassour version debuted in the &quot;Young Justice&quot; animated television series alongside others based upon pre-existing characters not typically associated with the character&#x27;s comic book iterations, including Zatara, Zatanna, and Traci Thirteen.

==Creation==
In a 1987 interview, Fox recalled the genesis behind Fate, stating, &quot;Doctor Fate (I originally called him Doctor Droon, but the name was editorially changed) was one of my favorites. I created him and even sketched out the original costume he would wear - but that costume was changed by artists over the years, for one reason or another. To my knowledge, I wrote all the Dr. Fate yarns that appeared, up until 1968, when I left comic book writing to a great degree. I always liked the supernatural; I read Lovecraft, Derleth, Sax Rohmer, Howard, Clark Ashton Smith, Whitehead, all the others, Fate was a derivation from my imagination influenced by those writings&quot;

==Publication history==

=== Golden, Silver, and Bronze Age of Comics (1940 - 1985) ===
The original version of the character, Kent Nelson, first appeared in a self-titled six page strip in &quot;More Fun Comics&quot; #55 (May 1940), during the Golden Age of Comic Books, created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Howard Sherman, who produced the first three years of monthly Doctor Fate stories. Soon after, the character&#x27;s origin shown in &quot;More Fun Comics&quot; #67 (May 1941). Stories during the Golden Age included his love interest, Inza, who was known variably throughout the Golden Age as Inza Cramer, Inza Sanders, and Inza Carmer. When the Justice Society of America was created for &quot;All Star Comics&quot; #3 (Winter 1940), Doctor Fate was one of the characters National Comics used for the joint venture with All-American Publications. He made his last appearance within the book in issue #21 (Summer 1944), virtually simultaneously with the end of his own strip in &quot;More Fun Comics&quot; #98 (July–August 1944).

The character later appeared in book such as the annual JSA/JLA team-ups in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; that began in 1963 and &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; #201 (March 1971 and #208, December 1971); an appearance with Batman in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #156 (November 1979); and a solo story in &quot;1st Issue Special&quot; #9 (December 1975), written by Martin Pasko and drawn by Walt Simonson. Doctor Fate and the rest of The Justice Society returned to &quot;All-Star Comics&quot; in 1976 with issue #58, for a two-year run ending with issue #74 and &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #461-462 in 1978, and &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #466 related the untold tale of the Justice Society&#x27;s 1951 disbanding. During this period, Inza Cramer&#x27;s name as such was amended.

During the Bronze Age, the character&#x27;s origin was retold in &quot;DC Special Series&quot; #10, and Doctor Fate again teamed up with Superman in &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; #23 (July 1980), and featured in a series of back-up stories running in &quot;The Flash&quot; from #306 (February 1982) to No. 313 (September 1982) written by Martin Pasko (aided by Steve Gerber from #310 to No. 313) and drawn by Keith Giffen. In 1981,DC&#x27;s &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot; elaborated upon the adventures of many World War II-era heroes, including Doctor Fate and the JSA. Doctor Fate made occasional modern-day appearances in &quot;Infinity, Inc.&quot; throughout 1984, the same year which witnessed the 22nd and final annual Justice Society/Justice League team-up. In 1985, DC collected the Doctor Fate back-up stories from &quot;The Flash&quot;, a retelling of Doctor Fate&#x27;s origin by Paul Levitz, Joe Staton, and Michael Nasser originally published in &quot;Secret Origins of Super-Heroes&quot; (January 1978) (&quot;DC Special Series&quot; #10 in the Indicia), the Pasko/Simonson Doctor Fate story from &quot;1st Issue Special&quot; #9, and a Doctor Fate tale from &quot;More Fun Comics&quot; #56 (June 1940), in a three-issue limited series titled &quot;The Immortal Doctor Fate&quot;.

Doctor Fate later appeared in several issues of the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths,&quot; assisting various heroes from the DC Multiverse battle the Anti-Monitor and later Amethyst. Despite the significant alterations to various histories resulting from the crisis, much of Kent Nelson&#x27;s personal history remained largely unaffected, although much of the earlier stories during the Golden Age were retconned out.

=== Modern Age (1985 - 2011) ===
In 1987, the &quot;Doctor Fate&quot; limited series was released, featuring the debut of Eric and Linda Strauss. The characters would replace Kent Nelson as Doctor Fate, who is killed off in the series. A subsequential ongoing series was released focusing on the former two characters, the first twenty-four issues having been written and drawn by J.M. DeMatteis and Shawn McManus, starting in the winter of 1988. The series&#x27; premise involved the pair under the guidance of Nabu, who inhabited and taken Kent Nelson&#x27;s identity. The series&#x27; also establishes a supporting cast for the characters, the recurring concept of kali yuga amongst the Lords of Chaos and Order, a period where chaos reigns and order is defeat, and established the incarnations to be the result of reincarnation cycles. During DeMatteis&#x27;s run, the series experienced limited sales. Doctor Fate would also appear in several other crossovers and storylines, including &quot;Millennium&quot; and &quot;Cosmic Odyssey&quot;. Both characters are killed off halfway into the series, replaced by resurrected Inza and Kent Nelson from issue #25 onward in 1991. The series ended with issue #41. and following &quot;Zero Hour&quot;, DC killed off both Kent and Inza. 
A new incarnation, Jared Stevens, was introduced in a self-titled series called &quot;Fate&quot;, launched in the wake of &quot;Zero Hour&quot; in 1994. The Doctor Fate character went through a radical redesign, dropping the &quot;Doctor&quot; title and gaining new weapons made from the previous related artifacts of Doctor Fate. Unlike prior depictions of the Doctor Fate character as a sorcerer, the character was instead a demon hunter. Considered an unpopular re-imagining of the character, the series was cancelled after 23 issues in September 1996. The character then starred in &quot;The Book of Fate&quot; written by Keith Giffen, which ran from February 1997 to January 1998 for twelve issues as part of DC&#x27;s &quot;Weirdoverse&quot; imprint, rebooting the character&#x27;s origins and adventures. However, the revival of the JSA title in 1991 allowed an opportunity for the Doctor Fate character to be reworked, with Jared Stevens subsequently killed off.

The next incarnation of Doctor Fate would come in the form of Hector Hall, the son of the Golden Age Hawkman and Hawkgirl who is reincarnated due to the machinations of a supervillain. A fan-favorite incarnation, the character was featured in the &quot;JSA&quot; title and a five issue &quot;Doctor Fate&quot; limited series in 2003. The character was killed in the &quot;Day of Vengeance&quot; limited series in 2005 as part of the lead in to the 2005 company-wide event story, &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;.

In early 2007, DC published a bi-weekly run of one-shots depicting the search for a new Doctor Fate. These were intended to be followed by a new &quot;Doctor Fate&quot; ongoing series in April 2007, written by Steve Gerber and illustrated by Paul Gulacy, featuring Kent V. Nelson. However, the series was delayed due to extended production and creative difficulties. Gerber said in an interview for Newsarama that the story intended for the first arc of the &quot;Doctor Fate&quot; ongoing series had been reworked to serve as the main story for &quot;Countdown to Mystery&quot;, a dual-feature eight-issue miniseries with Eclipso as the second feature. The first issue of &quot;Countdown to Mystery&quot;, with art by Justiniano and Walden Wong rather than Gulacy, was released in November 2007. Due to Gerber&#x27;s death, the seventh issue was written by Adam Beechen using Gerber&#x27;s notes. The final issue was written by Beechen, Gail Simone, Mark Waid, and Mark Evanier, who each wrote a different ending to the story.

The character then appeared in the &quot;Reign in Hell&quot; miniseries and in &quot;Justice Society of America&quot; (vol. 3) #30 (August 2009), featuring in the book until its cancellation with #54 in August 2011. During the series, Marc Guggenheim described Doctor Fate&#x27;s role as a powerhouse but intended to flesh out the character.

=== The New 52 and beyond (2011 - present) ===
Following the events of the &quot;Flashpoint&quot; mini-series in 2011, DC&#x27;s continuity was rebooted. As part of The New 52 initiative, an alternate version of Doctor Fate named Khalid Ben-Hassin was created by writer James Robinson and artist Brett Booth. The character was featured in the &quot;Earth 2&quot; ongoing series from #9 (February 2013) onwards.

After the conclusion of the &quot;Convergence&quot; limited series in June 2015, DC launched a new &quot;Doctor Fate&quot; ongoing series, written by Paul Levitz and drawn by Sonny Liew as part of the DC You initiative, which saw an emphasis on &quot;story over continuity&quot;, loosening the restrictions of continuity to allow for a diverse range of genres while some characters underwent status quo changes. The title focused on the newest and most recent incarnation of Doctor Fate, an Egyptian-American medical student named Khalid Nassour. Created with an emphasis on diversity and inspired by Marvel Comics heroes Spider-Man and Doctor Strange, the series also rebooted he Kent Nelson character, depicting him as a previous Doctor Fate, a mentor figure with some of his old histories intact. The series ran for 18 issues, from June 2015 to November 2016.

In 2018, DC launched a second &quot;Justice League Dark&quot; series written by James Tynion IV starring a new roster led by Wonder Woman. In this roster, Khalid and Kent Nelson were revealed to be eventual new members of the Justice League, originally acting as &quot;advisors&quot; in the team and becoming reoccurring characters. Nassour would eventually permanently become the new Doctor Fate instead of Kent Nelson in the &quot;Lords of Order&quot; storyline. Nassour would also receive a new redesign as Doctor Fate. Nelson&#x27;s character would be later killed off in the &quot;A Costly Trick of Magic&quot; storyline, leaving Nassour as the sole Doctor Fate character. While the original 2018 series was cancelled in 2020, the &quot;Justice League Dark&quot; series was re-purposed as a backup issue to the mainstream &quot;Justice League&quot; title, the backup issue being written by author Ram V, featuring a new storyline, with Khalid remaining a reoccurring member of the Justice League Dark subdivision. Khalid would also appear in several title crossovers such as &quot;Superman&quot;, &quot;Teen Titans Academy&quot;, and &quot;The Flash&quot;.

Beginning in 2021, Khalid Nassour would appear in major storylines such as the &quot;Justice League Dark: The Great Wickedness&quot; storyline, depicting a status quo change wherein the Helmet of Fate is damaged and is inhabited by a new entity. Connected to the Future State crossover event depicting an older Khalid Nassour having lived through the aftermath of the events of the &quot;Great Wickedness&quot; storyline, the entity is revealed to be the Egyptian goddess, Hauhhet. Nassour would also play a role in the &quot;Justice League&quot;/&quot;Justice League Dark&quot; crossover. In late 2022, the Nassour version concurrently appeared in the 2022 &quot;Justice Society of America&quot; comic and in several other notable crossovers such as &quot;Lazarus Planet&quot; and &quot;Dark Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;. In the &quot;Justice Society of America&quot; comic title, the character&#x27;s status quo from the previous &quot;Justice League Dark&quot; title carries over with the Khalid as a member of the Justice Society and playing a crucial role in defeating Degaton. The series would showcase different iterations of Doctor Fate as Degaton hunts the JSA across time and later rectified the history of the character.

In 2023, the Nelson version is referenced in the &quot;Knight Terrors&quot; storyline and the Nassour version appears in the Wonder Woman tie-tin. In late 2023 and 2024, Kent would make appearances in various titles such as &quot;Green Lantern: Alan Scott&quot; and &quot;Jay Garrick: The Flash&quot;, the comic books taking place decades prior to the character&#x27;s death in &quot;Justice League Dark&quot;. Khalid would also featured in the &quot;Absolute Power&quot; crossover, depicted as one of the heroes depowered by the machinations of Amanda Waller with the help of Amazo robots replicating the powers of heroes and Brainiac Queen.

== Character overview ==
Doctor Fate is a sorcerous hero commonly empowered by magical patrons. Since the first &quot;Doctor Fate&quot; series in 1989, the character was retroactively established as a legacy hero, with new incarnations introduced throughout their publication history.

=== Characterization ===

==== Pre-Flashpoint ====

===== Kent Nelson =====

The original version is acknowledged as an agent of order under Nabu and is considered a highly regarded incarnation. The character is notable marked by his complex and antagonistic relationship with Nabu, who often works to supplant his will and personal agency. While an experienced and respected hero who is often sought after for advice in his later years, Nelson often becomes disillusioned with the role over time and is supportive of a successor. Nelson&#x27;s character expresses an approach of Doctor Fate in which focuses on grand supernatural problems and believes problems in regards to humanity being mundane and doesn&#x27;t warrant such attention but adheres to the role encompassing a high responsibility.

===== Eric and Linda Strauss =====
The original successors of Kent Nelson&#x27;s role as Doctor Fate, both characters were ordinary individuals and outside their role as Doctor Fate, possessing no abilities of note, had the shortest tenure. Similar to Nelson, both are considered agents of order advised by Nabu, who appropriated a Kent&#x27;s deceased body during their tenure, making them independent from Nabu&#x27;s influence. The pair can mystically merge with one another to become an independent being known as Doctor Fate, with the artifacts instead manifesting only after the merging.

===== Inza Cramer =====
An American archaeologist of British descent, Inza was first depicted as a partner and love interest of Kent Nelson who faced various martial rifts from Nabu&#x27;s manipulations onto Kent and his hesitation in involving her in Doctor Fate-related activities. Within the second &quot;Doctor Fate&quot; solo series, Cramer is depicted as being inadvertently an agent for the Lords of Chaos as Doctor Fate, using her chaos-powered magic for benevolent reasons. Differing from previous incarnations before her, she is characterized using overwhelming power to simultaneously address both grander universal issues and more &quot;local&quot; issues (social inequality and poverty) in a district within New York City. A reoccurring conflict for the character is the moral and ethical usage of her powers, questioned often by her husband or friends.

===== Jared Stevens =====
A version of the Doctor Fate character often considered unpopular, the Stevens versions is radically different, referring to himself only simply as &quot;Fate&quot;, is retroactively acknowledged as a demon hunter, and doesn&#x27;t utilize spell-casting powers like previous incarnations. He is also referred to as an agent of for the Lords of Balance. As Fate, the character investigates supernatural occurrences and possess powers to sense disturbances and the fates of others but is a controversial figure within the DC Universe, considered a person of interest to government agencies, the superhero community (i.e. the Justice League), and aspects of the supernatural community. This enmity is characterized especially prevalent amongst those like Alan Scott, whom was close to previous incarnations.

===== Hector Hall =====

The Hall version of the character is the former son of Hawkman and Hawkgirl (Shiera Sanders) known as the Silver Scarab whom was killed by and reincarnated as the son of Hawk and Dove. Now the spiritual son of both Hawkman and Hawkgirl late possessing memories of his past lifetime, Halls is portrayed as legacy hero burdened with the responsibilities associated with Doctor Fate. While potentially being the greatest, he seeks to prove both himself and his teammates of being capable. Unlike previous versions, Hall is referred to an agent of balance.

===== Kent V. Nelson =====
Inspired by Marvel Comics&#x27; Doctor Strange and created by Steve Gerber to simplify aspects of the Doctor Fate character, Kent V. is the grandnephew of Kent Nelson and former psychiatrist who becomes an incarnation of Doctor Fate. Lacking any ties to other mythologies and the Lords of Chaos and Order, this version is a sorcerous hero of the Justice Society of America. The younger Nelson is also less apt in mystical arts and his intended characterization includes working to becoming more formidable by using a consistent set of spells and abilities. Alongside his great uncle, the character&#x27;s other familial connections include ex-wife Marissa Nelson, and daughter Laryn Nelson. Although the character&#x27;s history restoration into the prime continuity would retroactively make the character cousin to Khalid Nassour and the nephew of Elizabeth/Mohammed Nassour respectively, the new history has Nassour comment none were able to actually confirm his relation to the original Kent Nelson.

==== Post-Flashpoint ====
In more recent continuities from the New 52 onward, the character was re-defined as originally being champions and mystic defenders from ancient Egypt whom were vessels for Nabu due to possession of the Helmet of Fate until in recent times, with Kent Nelson being the first to use the codename &quot;Doctor Fate&quot; and exhibited incarnations&#x27; capacity for having personal agency. Prior to 2023, only Kent Nelson was stated to have been Doctor Fate prior to Khalid. While Geoff John&#x27;s &quot;Justice Society of America&quot; run restored past versions of Doctor Fate, timeline discrepancies complicate the timeline of Eric, Linda, Inza and revealed the events of &quot;Zero Hour&quot; taking place eight years prior to the comic&#x27;s timeline and seven years before Khalid became Doctor Fate, implying Jared, Hector, and Kent V.&#x27;s time as Doctor Fate collectively took place in the span of six years.

==== Khalid Nassour ====
Drawing inspiration from Marvel Comics&#x27; Doctor Strange and Spider-Man, Nassour is portrayed as a young adult and grandnephew of Kent Nelson burdened with significant responsibilities, embarking on a journey of self-discovery within a world reminiscent of Doctor Strange&#x27;s mystical realm. Supported initially by Nabu, it differed from past portrayals and was noted to be akin to a &quot;combination of a GPS system and the movie version of Iron Man&#x27;s J.A.R.V.I.S.&quot;, contrasting from past depictions as an overbearing presence. Nassour has been supported by various Egyptian deities, several archangels, and currently Hauhet, whom replaced Nabu with a yet unknown agenda. However, he retains the status of agent of order.

=== Patronage, role, and support ===

==== Lords of Chaos and Order ====
Doctor Fate is more commonly empowered as an agent for the Lords of Order and battles the forces of evil. Nabu is the most frequent patron and power behind various incarnations of Doctor Fate, noted for being a dissident and obsessive patron who often schemes to supplant and override the will of various incarnations; while the original Doctor Fate was gradually treated as a conduit for Nabu, subsequent incarnations would be given more personal agency. Other Lords of Order, such as Shat-Ru, also served as a patron of similar abilities but allowed the retention of agency. At times, the Lords of Chaos also have empowered Doctor Fate to showcase chaos not being equal to evil. In other instances, both groups or an affiliated subgroup (sometimes called the Lords of Balance) have also empowered Doctor Fate as an agent of balance, serving in a similar capacity to battling evil but also to act as a check and balances between the affiliated groups.

==== Ancient Egyptian deities ====
Since Khalid Nassour&#x27;s debut in the 2015 &quot;Doctor Fate&quot; series, Egyptian deities have served as patrons in place of the Lords of Chaos and Order for the aforementioned incarnation. In this arrangement, Doctor Fate remained an agent of order but is guided by Bastet and Nabu (a disciple of Thoth) while the powers associated with Doctor Fate is instead supplied by Thoth and later Hauhet, whom consolidates the role of being the guide and power behind Doctor Fate. The Egyptian deities also work directly under the purview of DC Comics&#x27; depiction of God in Abrahamic religions and archangels, with the Egyptian deities considered either a more powerful variant of jinns or fellow angels fashioning themselves as deities.

=== Reputation ===
Although specific accolades of each incarnation vary, the Doctor Fate character is considered among the most powerful superheroes in the DC Universe. Throughout the publication history of the character, specific descriptors of the character&#x27;s expressed is sometimes consistent with one another; the original and Hector were both cited as among the &quot;greatest living sorcerers&quot; due to possessing the artifacts. Similarly, Khalid and Hector are both comparable to noted sorceress Zatanna and alongside the Eric and Linda Strauss versions, are considered among the most powerful magic practitioners on Earth while Kent and Inza shared the distinction of &quot;one of the ten most powerful beings on Earth&quot;. Uniquely, the Kent V. is expressed with the title of &quot;Sorcerer Supreme&quot; within comics.

While all versions (sans Jared Stevens) are considerable in magical practice, Kent is often cited as the most formidable version and has been compared to later versions; Eric and Linda were once stated to potentially surpass Kent in raw power but lacked his knowledge. Hector was thought to be potentially more powerful than Nelson and all other past incarnations while Inza was more talented. Khalid&#x27;s comparisons ranged, from being lesser than other incarnation to being either only inferior to Kent and Hector or equal to Kent. Kent V. was noted to be lacking in skill, having to obfuscate his true skills through the reputation of past incarnations, and the Eric and Linda Strauss version in later stories were retroactively considered unremarkable.

== Fictional history ==
=== 20th Century ===
==== Origin and Nelson&#x27;s adventures ====
In his debut appearance in issue #55-56 for &quot;More Fun Comics&quot; (May–June 1940), the characters makes his first encounter with archnemesis Wotan and love interest Inza Cramer. Wotan is beaten but learns he did not pass into the afterlife and encounters him once again, attempting to blow up the Earth. Fate manages to defeat him, placing him in suspended animation before buring him deep within the Earth.

The character&#x27;s origin was first revealed in &quot;All-Star Comics&quot; #3 (1940), written by Garnder Fox, cumilating to Doctor Fate stating that he is not human nor had a childhood, created by elder gods and placed upon Earth to battle the forces of evil. One year later, the character was given a new origin with the alter-ego, Kent Nelson. Kent was the son of archaeologist Sven Nelson who encountered Nabu as a child during an excavation and accidentally kills his father by releasing poisonous gases. Nabu explains he is immortal alien being from the planet Cilia and pities the boy, taking him in to teach him the &quot;secrets of the universe&quot; and raises him into adulthood to become Doctor Fate.

The1963 &quot;Crisis on Earth-One&quot; and &quot;Crisis on Earth-Two&quot; storylines respectively revealed Neslon and the Justice Society of America&#x27;s reality to be of Earth-2 and meets with the Justice League of Earth-1, a superhero team of a parallel world. After years of retirement, Doctor Fate becomes semi-active and helps the teams.

In 1975, the storyline from &quot;1st Issue Special&quot; #9 reveals more of Nelson&#x27;s earlier years, pitting him against the mummy sorcerer Khalis while dealing with a frustrated Inza, whom he has married fifteen years after becoming Doctor Fate. The story also retroactively changes aspects of his origin, revealing Nabu altered young Kent&#x27;s mind to erase his grief and pain, establishing him as twelve years old during the incident and would slowly possess him as Doctor Fate when he was an adult. Three years later in 1978, Paul Levitz&#x27;s revisions alternatively depicting Nabu as a cosmic being of the Lords of Order and sought to use young Kent, whom he aged to adulthood and imparted into him his mystical knowledge in the process.

From 1981 to 1982, Nelson appears in backup issues in &quot;The Flash&quot; #306-313. Nelson continues to face foes from the Lords of Chaos while a martial rift between the pair grows due to Inza&#x27;s envy over Nabu&#x27;s presence and Nelson&#x27;s duties as Doctor Fate taking precedent over her and their marriage. In one instance, Totec weaponizes her envy against Nelson. In another, while Nelson battles a renegade Lord of Order and Lord of Chaos who team up, Inza nearly commits to infedelity with a museum curator. Sensing the rift to be potentially damaging to Nelson&#x27;s mind, Nabu allows the pair to both mend their marriage and later merges her with Kent temporarily, formulating a new Doctor Fate transformation that defeats the renegade Lords and grants Inza a higher understanding of her husband&#x27;s role.

==== &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; and onward ====
The character later appears in the Marv Wolfman and George Pérez&#x27;s &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; crossover series, merging both Earth-1 and Earth-2 realities within the multiverse altering event, with all past definitive histories histories having been said to happen on this composite universe (&quot;Earth&quot;). 

In the late-1980s, an older Kent Nelson appears as a key member of the Justice League International but is killed off in the1987 within J. M. DeMatteis&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Fate&quot; miniseries, which introduced the origin of Eric and Linda Strauss&#x27;s incarnation.

==== Eric and Linda Strauss&#x27;s tenure (1987 - 1991) ====

===== Strauss family&#x27;s background =====
Born in 1973, Eric Strauss is the son of a billionaire whose history of abuse led to the suicide of his birth mother and disdain of his stepmother. With the boy&#x27;s father dies and is placed and under her care, she is both attracted and amazed by Eric for reasons she cannot explain. Conversely, born in 1955, Linda Strauss is the twenty-eight year old stepmother and widow of Eric&#x27;s father who first engages in a relationship and marriage with the older man due to his wealth but regrets it when his abusive nature is revealed.

===== The Second Doctor Fate =====
At the age of ten, Eric is chosen by Nabu and the Lords of Order to succeed a aging Kent Nelson, who reluctantly agrees as his old age has weakened Doctor Fate&#x27;s powers. As the new Doctor Fate, Eric first faces Anti-Fate and Typhon and eventually prevails when he and his step mother, Linda, merge to defeat the pair. This also revealed the intended nature of Doctor Fate to be two vessels, a fact omitted by Nabu to better control Kent throughout the years. Nelson dies and the pair succeed him as Doctor Fate although Nabu acts as a adviser by inhabiting Kent Nelson&#x27;s old body. Within the second &quot;Doctor Fate&quot; series, the pair navigates odd occurrences while continuing their training as Doctor Fate, assisted by Petey the Demon (disguised in public as an ugly dog) and neighbor Jack C. Small, a lawyer. It is also revealed Eric and Linda to be a reincarnated pair alongside one another in several lifetimes subjected to familial, platonic, and even adversarial dynamics.

During the &quot;Cosmic Odyssey&quot; crossover, Eric and Linda are merged as Doctor Fate and are called in by Batman to assist Darkseid, Highfather, and others heroes called to battle a sentient being made up of Anti-Life energies. The pair are successful in defeating them with the help of Highfather, Darkseid, and Etrigan despite Darkseid being slighted from the event. In 1991,the pair are eventually killed off in different circumstances involving Darkseid (retroactively revealed to be a disguised DeSaad) and Anti-Fate respectively but reincarnate into new lives, ending their run. Their tenure as Doctor Fate was revealed to have lasted for approximately a year within the series.

==== Inza Cramer&#x27;s tenure (1991 - 1994) ====

In the same year during the second half of the second &quot;Doctor Fate&quot; series, Inza and Kent are revived in younger bodies. Circumstances makes Inza Doctor Fate, allowing her a social life and shifts her heroism towards social class issues and inequality alongside fighting the supernatural. Inza appears in the &quot;War of the Gods&quot; crossover and title alongside Wonder Woman and other superheroes to help thwart Circe&#x27;s efforts from destroying Earth.

==== Jared Steven&#x27;s Fate tenure (1994 - 1999) ====
In 1994, Jared Steven&#x27;s first origin story is depicted in early issues of the &quot;Fate&quot; series by John Francis Moore, where he is hired by elderly Kent and Inza Nelson to retrieve the lost artifacts of Doctor Fate. The pair are killed by demons when they try to collect the artifacts and Jared comes into contact with Nabu. Jared rejects his attempt to make him Doctor Fate under his control and circumstances causes him to alter the forms of the artifacts, the helmet now being a knife, the power of the Amulet of Anubis within him now, and the Cloak of Destiny now acting as bandages on his arm. He also instead utilizes the moniker of &quot;Fate&quot;.

In 1997, Keith Griffen later reboots his origins, wherein the elder Nelsons instead deceive Stevens into the role of Doctor Fate, allowing them to past into the afterlife peacefully and burdens him with the responsibilities.

In 1999, an issue of DC&#x27;s &quot;Secret Files and Origins&quot; establish various points in time: Nelson becoming Doctor Fate in 1940, the events of Eric and Linda Strauss&#x27;s time as Doctor Fate took place four years prior to the book&#x27;s timeline (1995) and Jared Steven was chosen as Fate one year prior to the book&#x27;s timeline (1998). Another &quot;SF&amp;O&quot; issue reinforces Nelson&#x27;s first time as Doctor Fate in 1940, Eric/Linda&#x27;s time being four years prior to the book&#x27;s timeline (1995) Jared being chosen one year ago (1998). However, Inza&#x27;s activities during &quot;War of the Gods&quot; is references to taken place two years prior (1997).

=== 21st Century ===

==== Hector Hall&#x27;s tenure (1999 - 2005) ====

In late 1999, The story within the book (JSA Secret Files) also is part of and leads into the &quot;Justice Be Done&quot; storyline by James Robinson and David S. Goyer Jared Stevens is killed off and replaced with Hector Hall, the son of Hawkman and Hawkgirl who is reincarnated as the new Doctor Fate and aged up from an infant by the villain Mordru, who he then battles and prevails thanks to the spirit of Kent and Inza within the Amulet of Anubis. Hector Hall&#x27;s Doctor Fate also appears in the &quot;Day of Judgement&quot; comic title and crossover, depicted as a member of the Sentinels of Magic.

In the 2003 &quot;Doctor Fate&quot; limited series, Hall battles the Curse, a demigod sorcerer that challenged Nabu in the past. Similar to Nabu in being bound to a helmet, he gains a willing host in Justin Guilder, who is vying alongside Hector for the affection of love interest, Caitlin. Hall is assisted by a Wiccan coven but is later mortally injured and meets Nabu&#x27;s spirit in the helm, who berates him due to not living up his potential despite being seen as the most powerful Doctor Fate incarnation. Overpowering Nabu and his verbal abuse, he revitalizes himself and defeats the Curse, becoming more secure and confident in the process.

In the 2005 &quot;Day of Vengeance&quot; crossover, Hector is killed by the Spectre and Nabu briefly acts in place of Doctor Fate. He gathers gather mystics and later confronts the ghost, driven to insanity and commits towards a witch-hunt for all magic users, destroying the Lords of Chaos and Order in the process. Fatally injured, he succeeds in stopping the Spectre but dies. In his final moments, he asks Captain Marvel to throw the helmet into space in hopes it finds a worthy bearer.

==== Kent V. Nelson&#x27;s tenure (2007 - 2011) ====

Throughout 2007–2008, the Kent V. Nelson version is introduced by Steve Gerber following Hall&#x27;s death in &quot;Countdown to Mystery&quot;. His origin depicts him as a former psychiatrist whose life spirals out of control following an infidelity, depression, and loss of medical license. The grandnephew of the original Kent Nelson, whom he is named after, he continues the Doctor Fate line when he dons the helmet sometime prior to the Final Crisis crossover event and battles longtime Doctor Fate villain, Nergal. Due to Gerber&#x27;s death, the conclusion of the series features several different endings from his notes written by several other writers.

In 2008–2009, the &quot;Reign in Hell&quot; storyline and comic title features Kent V. alongside other notable magic users (Zatanna, Ibis the Invincible, Enchantress, etc.) getting involved in a civil war in hell between Neron, the current ruler, and duo siblings Satanus and Blaze, the demonic children of the Wizard Shazam. An inexperienced sorcerer, Nelson is unaware of how to escape from hell and battles Blaze, who lambasts him for his limited experience but is defeated when she hints how to focus his power. He also helps the group fight Lobo, who has been exiled to Hell.

In 2010–2011, the original Nelson&#x27;s spirit appears to help Green Lantern while stuck on a planet with no way to escape, learning of his future death but chooses to save Hal instead despite his protests. Later, the current Nelson becomes involved in the Justice Society, helping the team fight against a team of villains targeting the JSA, later saving Mister Terrific&#x27;s life, and battling Mordru despite his limited talents before leaving to improve his abilities. In &quot;The Dark Things&quot; crossover storyline, he later comes under the Starheart&#x27;s influence and abducts JSA team members and Sebastian Faust as the Starheart pits themselves against the JSA and JLA with the help Alan Scott&#x27;s mind controlled children, Jade and Obsidian. He also helps the team fight against the new threat known as Scythe and helps Lightning deal with the rift between her and her father, Black Lightning, and is scarred in process when helping her through mystical means.

=== New 52 onward (2015 - 2023) ===
Following the New 52 reboot in 2012, the Kent V. Nelson version is erased from existence alongside much of the past incarnations of Doctor Fate. In 2015, the current version of Doctor Fate is re-imagined by Paul Levitz as twenty-two year old biracial Egyptian-American Khalid Nassour, who is Muslim, a descendant of a line of Pharaohs, and a medical student. In his debut story, he inherits the mantle of Doctor Fate from ancient Egyptian deities and archangels alike to oppose Anubis. Subsequent stories It is later revealed that he is connected to the Nelson bloodline through his mother, who is described to be Kent Nelson&#x27;s favorite niece who inspired her towards archaeology. An elderly Kent also returns into the role and mentors Khalid, with both characters as Doctor Fate concurrently, 

Nelson later takes precedent within the role, with Nabu also briefly usurping it to battle Arion and assist the latest Blue Beetle, and appears in crossovers such as 2017&#x27;s &quot;Dark Nights: Metal.&quot; During James Tynion IV&#x27;s run in &quot;Justice League Dark&quot; from 2017 to 2019, Kent, Khalid, and Nabu are featured heavily in the run. The pair are trapped by Nabu, who uses Nelson&#x27;s body and conspires with other Lords of Order to destroy the source of magic following the piercing of the Source Wall. Their plans are interrupted by Wonder Woman&#x27;s newly created Justice League Dark and their allies, who free Khalid. Enlisting the power of chaos magic from Mordru, Kent is freed from Nabu&#x27;s control and the team prevails in defeating the Lords of Order. Wonder Woman asks Nelson to don the helmet once more, who refuses due to his disillusionment and recommends Khalid, who also declines. The pair enlist themselves as advisory based members of Justice League Dark but when the team is pitted against Circe&#x27;s Injustice League Dark, Khalid becomes the sole Doctor Fate and assists in their defeat.

A a revised version of Inza also appeared briefly in the second &quot;Justice League Dark&quot; series in a flashback, suggesting her history is similar to prior depictions, where she acted as the partner of Kent Nelson and the pair faced strains on their marriage due to his role as Doctor Fate.

==== Infinite Frontier and Dawn of DC ====
As the sole Doctor Fate, Nassour becomes a trusted member of Justice League Dark, was instrumental in both restoring the Parliaments governing the elemental forces of the DC Universe and the eventual defeat of Upside-Down Man, where Kent sacrifices himself to deal a powerful blow but at the cost of the helm being depleted of power. During Infinite Frontier, the character is revealed to have taken in non-binary animated effigy Stich as both child and apprentice in the mystic arts and managed to restore the power lost against Upside-Down Man with Kirk Langstom&#x27;s help as the Justice League Dark battled an evil Merlin. A new spirit, the goddess Hauhet, is revealed to have replaced Nabu and grants Nassour the power to see into the future. In the 2022 &quot;Dark Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; crossover, Nassour joins the Justice Society and helps in efforts to defeat Pariah and the Great Darkness.

In 2023 during the Dawn of DC, Nassour is mentioned in both the prelude and main event of the Lazarus Planet crossover and appears in the spin-off. The former mentions he is bested by Nezha and the helm is stolen for his purposes and his disappearance was noticed by heroes. Dreamer discovers he is trapped in a dream-like state after being enlisted by Batman to help track him down. In his concurrent appearances in Geoff John&#x27;s 2023 &quot;Justice Society of America&quot; series, chronologically taking place after Lazarus Planet, Nassour helps the team and future Helena Wayne fight against Per Degaton&#x27;s attempt to erase them from existence with the help of JSA members across time while a past Nelson reconciles the various alterations in his lifetime from Degaton. The title addresses timeline discrepancies, noting events like &quot;Zero Hour&quot; occurred eight years earlier and the 2015 &quot;Doctor Fate&quot; series is set one year prior. However, Khalid&#x27;s appearances in other titles, especially &quot;Justice League Dark&quot;, suggest a tenure longer than four years, as he is depicted as a medical school graduate and being a first-year resident physician. Also, Fate&#x27;s injury from Extant during &quot;Zero Hour&quot; remains unclear, as it is uncertain whether it affected Kent Nelson alone or if it occurred during a joint fusion between Inza and Kent as previously depicted.

In 2024, aspects of past incarnations&#x27; histories are restored by Geoff Johns and Nelson makes posthumous appearances during the 1940s which expands on his histories in the new reality that followed the New 52. One noted change includes him and Inza having the young arrogant sidekick, Salem the Witch Girl, under their care until her disappearance following Inza&#x27;s near-death experience from Salem&#x27;s bad luck curse. Her subsequent removal from time erased their memories of her. Among other minor appearances includes Kent being present when Wesley Dodds was recruited into the JSA, assisted Flash (Jay Garrick) alongside the JSA and the Boom (Garrick&#x27;s daughter) in battling Doctor Elemental, and aiding Green Lantern (Alan Scott) when attacked by a group of similarly powered villains known as the Crimson Hosts. Nassour&#x27;s involvement saw both the events of &quot;Knight Terrors&quot; unfold and Salem&#x27;s return to the current timeline, where she is hostile due to his placement in the legacy of Doctor Fate. Nassour places Salem under the JSA&#x27;s care until the pair can reconcile and is ventures to the 31st Century to help the Legion of Substitute Heroes unearth a plot by Eclipso.

=== DC All-In (2024 - Present) ===
Nassour was present in the Absolute Power crossovers, among the heroes captured for a time and becomes a member of the now rebranded Justice League Unlimited months following the events. He assists the League in defeating Darkseid, with the League inadvertently helps the villain become a significant, negative influence in the Absolute Universe, and battles a new iteration of the Injustice Society alongside the JSA team.

== Powers, abilities, and resources ==

=== Doctor Fate&#x27;s powers and abilities ===

==== Mystical artifacts ====
While incarnations of Doctor Fate often possess different abilities compared to one another, all possess a collection of powerful magical artifacts that can empower individuals of limited supernatural skill with substantial mystical power, in which experienced incarnations possess a godlike level of magical power and knowledge which makes them nearly unmatched in spell-casting and capable of virtually any kind of mystical feat. These artifacts also serve a dual purpose of both enhancing inherent magical powers and serving as protective measures.

===== Helmet of Fate =====
The Helmet of Fate bestows its wearer with extraordinary god-like abilities and is widely regarded as one of the most potent artifacts in existence. Constructed from Nth metal, the helmet possesses inherent mystical properties and possesses the unique ability to counteract and negate magical forces. Whether guided by the residing spirit within the helm or through the helm&#x27;s own discernment, the artifact is typically accessible only to individuals deemed worthy by its judgment. Despite its formidable nature, the Helmet of Fate is not impervious to damage. It has shown vulnerability to powerful entities like Arion and Brimstone, requiring subsequent regeneration. The helmet is susceptible to potent forms of Atlantean magic, power from higher beings such as the Spectre, and advanced applications of the Firestorm matrix. It can also experience overload, resulting in temporary limitations and the inertness of certain powers.

Throughout the publication history of Doctor Fate, the portrayal of the helm&#x27;s source and methodology of power has undergone various changes, dependent on the incarnation of:
===== Amulet of Anubis =====
The Amulet of Anubis is a significant magical artifact associated with the Doctor Fate legacy. Its origins have been depicted in various narratives. One account states that it was created by Anubis and initially possessed by Khalis before being claimed by Nabu. Another origin story suggests that the amulet was crafted from the remnants of Cilia, connecting it to the Lords of Order. In the New 52 continuity, Thoth is presumed to be the creator. Regardless, the amulet bestows various powers, which includes resistance to psychic and astral probing, mind control, and magical power enhancement, necromancy and contains its own separate universe apt for trapping entities.

===== Cloak of Destiny =====
The Cloak of Destiny is a cape which possess magical qualities that grants the user several powers such as invulnerability, superhuman strength, and flight. It is also fireproof and counters the magical abilities originating form the Lords of Chaos.

===== Other artifacts and resources =====
Others include the Orb of Nabu, serving as a scrying glass and allows him Fate search for hidden threats by reacting to his brainwaves. Although not explicitly magical, it provides valuable insights for the bearers In addition to possessing powerful mystical artifacts, Doctor Fate has access to various resources, including the Tower of Fate. This fictional structure serves as Doctor Fate&#x27;s primary dwelling and is considered a nexus point of magic and reality on Earth. The tower is only accessible through magic and lacks doors or windows. Inside, it appears as a twisted maze of stairways and hallways where the laws of physics do not apply. The Tower of Fate houses a vast personal library containing arcane texts, including materials salvaged from the Library of Alexandria. It is fortified with mystical defenses. Doctor Fate also possesses the &quot;Book of Fate&quot;, a tome that contains a comprehensive history and knowledge of the Lords of Chaos and Order, predominantly from the perspective of the latter.

==== Weaknesses ====
The character possess several known weaknesses and limitations. One known weakness is that Doctor Fate is expressed to be unable to use counter spells against exist ones due to established &quot;rules of magic&quot; within the DC Universe. Some versions such as Kent V. possess no innate powers and are dependent on the helm. Older aged versions can diminish their potency, power, and effectiveness as Doctor Fate while inexperience hampers younger iterations&#x27; mastery of their magical abilities. Inza Cramer&#x27;s usage of magic puts her mental state is at risk of being compromised due to her engagement with chaos magic or a lack of formal training, depending on the storyline. The character is also explicitly stated as being inferior to the Spectre in power. 

=== Inza Cramer&#x27;s abilities ===
Beyond her abilities afforded by the Helmet of Fate, Inza is a skilled archaeologist with expertise in the occult and a martial artist. 

=== Jared Stevens&#x27;s powers and abilities ===
Being more akin to a demon hunter, Stevens possessed mystic alterations from the Lords of Chaos and Order that granted him an enhanced physiology which included a healing factor and the power to see the fate of others through his eye accompanied by an ankh. Early versions of the character also made him immune to magic although later iterations lacked this power. When using the Mystic Dagger of Nabu and ankh darts, he can telepathically control its movements and trajectory when thrown. Stevens is also a skilled combatant and possess various skills, including hot-wiring. 

== Other versions ==
== Cultural impact and legacy ==

=== Reception ===
As a character, Doctor Fate has established himself as one of DC Comics&#x27; enduring figures, although not reaching the same level of cultural recognition as iconic characters like Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman or The Flash. According to Wizard Magazine, Doctor Fate&#x27;s notable strengths lie in his name, distinctive design, and the recurring motif of the Helmet of Fate. While the character has experienced various cancellations over time, they have also been the focus of multiple miniseries and ongoing series. 

Several versions of the character have critical acclaim; the Hector Hall version was considered a fan-favorite during the 1999 &quot;JSA&quot; run and the Khalid Nassour incarnation was well-received among critics and was compared to Marvel Comics&#x27; Kamala Khan as representing an underrepresented demographic while also praising his design and incorporation of Egyptian elements compared to Greek/Roman. The character&#x27;s portrayal by Pierce Brosnan in &quot;Black Adam&quot; was also received well and was once slated to eventually appear again in the DC Extended Universe due to his popularity prior to James Gunn&#x27;s appointment as creative head for DC Studios. 

=== Criticisms ===
Despite the character&#x27;s relative success, several criticisms arise throughout their publication history. In a noted example, the Jared Stevens version was panned due to his design and departure from the common elements of the character. Other criticisms included the character&#x27;s connections to Egypt and portrayal of abilities.

==== Egyptian representation ====
The character&#x27;s connection to Egypt has been subjected to various criticisms in recent years, with the Ben-Hassin and Nassour versions similarly created to be explicitly of Egyptian heritage to rectify this. James Robinson&#x27;s creation of Ben-Hassin was also made to avoid an offensive characterization, opting to make the character Egyptian-American. Similarly, Paul Levitz also made Nassour of the same background and expressed it made more sense, and believed the earlier versions to be a product of its time when writers could not write in detail about ethnicity and religion.

Nassour&#x27;s characterization and role in various storylines has also been subjected to criticism; Jessica Plumber believed a Muslim writer would have made the character more authentic in representing a Muslim character and found Khalid&#x27;s fate being &quot;reduced&quot; to a hieroglyphic in a vase during the Tynion&#x27;s Justice League Dark run ironic due to being a Doctor Fate of Egyptian descent. Adrienne Resha also noted his portrayal in the same series, believing the character to be sidelined in favor of other characters despite being the only clearly identifiable person of color on the team and frequently invoking Egypt&#x27;s past and mythology instead of its current history and events. Comic historian Tim Hanley also believed Nassour to be an example among the characters of color often becoming secondary characters who are sidelined, featured only as backlist team members, or fade into obscurity.

==== Portrayal of abilities ====
Throughout the character&#x27;s history, Doctor Fate&#x27;s depiction concerning his abilities has garnered various criticisms from writers; Steve Gerber was critical of the character&#x27;s abilities prior to 2007 pointing out the character&#x27;s inconsistent power level, which posed challenges for writers in defining the character effectively. Moreover, Gerber expressed reservations about the recurring element of the Nabu entity controlling Doctor Fate, as he believed it hindered the character&#x27;s ability to form meaningful connections. Additionally, Gerber advocated for an original interpretation of magic, akin to the approach taken with Marvel&#x27;s Doctor Strange, rather than Doctor Fate&#x27;s association with Egyptian mythology and believed the character&#x27;s history to be among the most convoluted. He sought to address this with the Kent V. Nelson incarnation of the character.

During his run in the &quot;Justice Society of America&quot; comic book title, Marc Guggenheim opined a tendency for magical-oriented characters to cease being characters (&quot;people&quot;) and become a set of powers. With the Kent V. Nelson version of the character, he sought to characterize Doctor Fate into a more &quot;three-dimensional character&quot;. James Robinson also stated how despite the reoccurring theme of a &quot;cost&quot; to magic, Doctor Fate&#x27;s magical powers &quot;feels and certainly looks no different than a blast of energy from Green Lantern&#x27;s ring. It&#x27;s just energy that gets fired.&quot;

<doc id="412352" wikidata="Q240601" url="?curid=412352" title="Provinces of Algeria">
<text>Algeria, as of 2024, is divided into 58 wilayas (provinces). Prior to December 18, 2019, there were 48 provinces. The 58 provinces are divided into 1,541 baladiyahs (municipalities). The name of a province is always that of its capital city. 

According to the Algerian constitution, a wilaya is a territorial collectivity enjoying economic and diplomatic freedom, the APW, or &quot;Popular Provincial Parliament/Provincial Popular Parliament&quot; (the &quot;Assemblée Populaire Wilayale&quot;, in French) is the political entity governing a province, directed by the &quot;Wali&quot; (Governor), who is chosen by the Algerian President to handle the APW&#x27;s decisions, the APW has also a president, who is elected by the members of the APW, which Algerians elect.

== List ==
By 1984 the number of Algerian provinces was fixed at 48 and established the list of municipalities or &quot;communes&quot; attached to each province. In 2019, 10 new provinces were added.

The province numbers are the first 31 provinces (see the second section) in Arabic alphabetical order, after the adding of 17 more provinces in 1983 and 10 more in 2019, the old numbering was kept and the 27 provinces created since 1984 have been assigned codes from 32 to 58, in Arabic alphabetical order.

The following table presents the list of provinces, showing for each its numerical code, its name (which is at all times the same as the name of the capital city of the province), the number of districts (&quot;dairas&quot;), the number of municipalities, its area, and its population.

== Since 2019 ==
On 26 November 2019, the Cabinet of Algeria passed a bill to add 10 more provinces, by splitting some of the larger provinces in the south of Algeria into smaller ones. Thus, the following provinces have been added on December 18, 2019:
* Bordj Badji Mokhtar Province
* Ain Salah Province
* Djanet Province
* Ain Guezzam Province
* El M&#x27;Ghair Province
* Touggourt Province
* Béni Abbès Province
* Timimoun Province
* Ouled Djellal Province
* El Menia Province
==1984–2019==

In 1984 17 new provinces were added. These provinces included:
# El Bayadh
# Illizi
# Bordj Bou Arréridj
# Boumerdès
# El Taref
# Tindouf
# Tissemsilt
# El Oued
# Khenchela
# Souk Ahras
# Tipaza
# Mila
# Aïn Defla
# Naâma 
# Aïn Témouchent
# Ghardaïa
# Relizane

== 1974–1983 ==

The 15 departments were reorganized to form 31 provinces:
== 1957–1974 ==

Immediately after independence, Algeria retained its 15 former French départements, which were renamed wilayas (provinces) in 1968, for the most part, with some name changes:

*8A-El Wahat (Currently Ouargla, formerly Oasis)
*8B-Saoura (Currently Béchar)
*9A-Alger (Algiers)
*9B-Batna
*9C-Annaba (Formerly Bône, English: Bona)
*9D-Constantine
*9E-Médéa
*9F-Mostaganem
*9G-Oran
*9H-Orléansville (Then El Asnam, now Chlef)
*9J-Sétif
*9K-Tiaret
*9L-Tizi-Ouzou
*9M-Tlemcen
*9R-Saïda

== 1954–1962 ==
During the Algerian War of Independence, the FLN adopted an organizational system divided by 6 numbered &quot;wilayas&quot;:

#Aurès
#Constantine
#Kabylie
#Algiers
#Oran
#Sahara

<doc id="412353" wikidata="Q5593877" url="?curid=412353" title="Grammy Award for Best Chamber Music/Small Ensemble Performance">
<text>The Grammy Award for Best Small Ensemble Performance (from 2013: Best Chamber Music/Small Ensemble Performance) has been awarded since 1997. In its early years, its title included the addition &quot;(with or without a conductor)&quot;.

In 1991 the Grammy for Best Chamber Music Performance also included small ensemble performances.

==2012 overhaul and 2013 renaming==
In 2012 the category was combined with the Best Chamber Music Performance category.

The restructuring of these categories was a result of the Recording Academy&#x27;s wish to decrease the list of categories and awards. According to the Academy, &quot;the Chamber category was folded into the Small Ensemble category, the only distinction having been the number of players in the group (Chamber being smaller), and the fact that Small Ensemble recording could, though not necessarily, employ a conductor.&quot; 

In the new structure, recordings are eligible if the ensemble contains 24 or fewer members, not including the conductor. 

In 2013, the category was renamed as Best Chamber Music/Small Ensemble Performance.

The award goes to the winning ensemble and its conductor (if applicable). The producer(s) and engineer(s) also receive an award if they have worked on over 50% of playing time on the album.

Years reflect the year in which the Grammy Awards were presented, for works released in the previous year.

<text>Theophany () is an encounter with a deity that manifests in an observable and tangible form. It is often confused with other types of encounters with a deity, but these interactions are not considered theophanies unless the deity reveals itself in a visible form. Traditionally, the term &quot;theophany&quot; was used to refer to appearances of the gods in ancient Greek and Near Eastern religions. While the &quot;Iliad&quot; is the earliest source for descriptions of theophanies in classical antiquity, the first description appears in the Epic of Gilgamesh.

==Ancient Greek religion==

In Greek religion, there are a few instances of theophany. In historic times, theophanies were rare, but divine or heroic epiphanies were experienced either through dreams or waking visions. Theophanies were reenacted at a number of Greek sites and festivals. At Delphi, the &quot;Theophania&quot; (Θεοφάνια) was an annual festival in spring celebrating the return of Apollo from his winter quarters in Hyperborea. The culmination of the festival was a display of an image of the gods, usually hidden in the sanctuary, to worshippers.

==Hinduism==
The most well-known theophany is in the Bhagavad Gita, one chapter of the larger epic of Mahabharata. On the battlefield of Kurukshetra, the god Krishna gives the famed warrior Arjuna a series of teachings. Arjuna begs for Krishna to reveal his &quot;universal form.&quot; Krishna complies and gives Arjuna the spiritual vision, enabling him to see Krishna in the universal form.

A number of other theophanies are described in the Mahabharata. First, the god Indra&#x27;s appearance to Kunti, with the subsequent birth of the hero Arjuna. Near the end of the epic, the god Yama takes the form of a dog to test the compassion of Yudhishthira. Even though Yudhishthira is told he may not enter paradise with such an animal, he refuses to abandon his companion, earning him praise from Dharma.

==Christianity==
Christians generally recognize the same Old Testament theophanies as the Jews. In addition, there are at least two events seen as theophanies mentioned in the New Testament, the baptism and transfiguration of Jesus (epiphanies). While some Eastern Orthodox Churches refer to the baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist as &quot;theophany&quot;, some theologians discourage such usage, arguing that the entire life of Jesus must be seen as a prolonged theophany.

Traditional analysis of the Biblical passages led Christian scholars to understand &quot;theophany&quot; as an unambiguous manifestation of God to man. Otherwise, the more general term hierophany is used.

===Evangelical Christianity===
Some modern evangelical Christian Bible commentators, such as Ron Rhodes, interpret &quot;the angel of the Lord&quot;, who appears in several places throughout the Old Testament, to be the pre-incarnate Christ, which is Jesus before his manifestation into human form, as described in the New Testament. Adaptions to his hypothesis in current evangelical research and intercollegiate debate describe these manifestations as the post-incarnate Christ (yet to be published), as though in being a divine human capable of time travel He could foretell his later incarnation as having already lived it. The term Christophany has also been coined to identify post-incarnate appearances of Christ in both the Old and New Testaments. 1 Peter 4 (v.6) allows for the interpretation that on the Son&#x27;s Father-Spirit (as the third member of the trinity fulfilling the unity of various persons as Christ is crowned King of Kings) and being conferred from the cross with the words, &quot;Eloi, Eloi! Lama Sabachtani&quot;, was thereby born or separated as the timeless Word (or angel) of God (John 1 and 5) with the character and memory of Christ, even giving permission for creation &quot;Let there be..&quot; (Genesis 1) . This also has been the traditional interpretation of the earliest Church Fathers as well as the apostle Paul himself, who identifies the rock that was with Moses in the desert, and the speaking burning bush, as being Christ. For a more thorough list of &quot;God Sightings&quot;, or Theophanies, see the examples above under &quot;Judaism, Hebrew Bible.&quot;

===Latter Day Saint movement===

Joseph Smith, the prophet and founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, said that when he was 14 years old he was visited by God the Father and Jesus Christ in a grove of trees near his house, a Theophany in answer to his spoken prayer. This &quot;First Vision&quot; is considered to be the founding event of the Latter Day Saint movement. The Book of Mormon describes other hierophanies and Theophanies that occurred in the new world.

For example, Blake Ostler analysed the Throne-Theophany of Lehi in the First Book of Nephi and concluded that the Theophanies in the Bible and the Book of Mormon have much in common.

==Islam==
The most important theophany in Islam is the Mi&#x27;raj, the Prophet&#x27;s ascent into Heaven. He speaks to the Holy Spirit (Gabriel), sometimes called &quot;a night journey from Mecca through Jerusalem.&quot;

== Druze Faith ==
Hamza ibn Ali ibn Ahmad is considered the founder of the Druze and the primary author of the Druze manuscripts, he proclaimed that God had become human and taken the form of man, al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah. al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah is an important figure in the Druze faith whose eponymous founder ad-Darazi proclaimed him as the incarnation of God in 1018.

==Baháʼí Faith==

The Baháʼí Faith believes that God is manifest in the prophets. The &quot;Manifestation of God&quot; is a concept that refers to prophets like Zoroaster, Gautama Buddha, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, Muhammad, the Báb, and Baháʼu&#x27;lláh. The Manifestations of God are a series of personages who reflect the attributes of the divine in the human world, for the progress and advancement of human morals and civilization.

In the 1914 publication titled &quot;The Reconciliation of Races and Religions&quot;, Thomas Kelly Cheyne, (1841–1915), an ordained minister in the Church of England and Oxford University scholar, described Theophany within the context of the Baháʼí Faith. Cheyne wrote, &quot;...one feels that a Theology without a Theophany is both dry and difficult to defend. We want an avatar, i.e. a &#x27;descent&#x27; of God in human form&quot;.

A 1991 article in the &quot;Journal of Bahá’í Studies&quot; (JBS), described &quot;Bahá’í theophanology&quot; as &quot;acceptance of the Prophet, or &#x27;Manifestation of God,&#x27; who speaks on behalf of God.&quot; The author explained that Bahá’u’lláh wrote a series of epistles in the 1860s to kings and rulers, including Pope Pius IX, Napoleon III, Tsar Alexander II of Russia, Queen Victoria, and Naser al-Din Shah Qajar, in a &quot;forceful, theophanic voice&quot; calling them to undertake reforms. These letters were published in a compilation entitled &quot;Summons of the Lord of Hosts&quot; in 2002. The &quot;JBS&quot; article described Bahá’u’lláh&#x27;s &quot;Theophanology&quot; as &quot;progressivist&quot;. He claimed &quot;spiritual Authority&quot; in these letters in which he warned western leaders of the dangers facing humanity should they choose to not act on His Guidance.

==Divine appearances to animals==
Human religious lore includes ancient literary recordings of deities appearing to animals. Usually, the animals relay the experience to humans using human speech:
* In numerous creation stories, a deity or deities speak with many kinds of animals, often prior to the formation of dry land on earth.
* In the Hindu Ramayana, the monkey leader Hanuman is informed by deities, and usually consciously addressed by them.
* In Chinese mythology, the Monkey King speaks with bodhisattvas, buddhas, and a host of Heavenly characters.

==Modern==

More recently, science fiction author Philip K. Dick reportedly had a Theophany on 3 February 1974, which would become the basis for his semi-biographic works &quot;VALIS&quot; (1981) and &quot;Radio Free Albemuth&quot; (1985).

In 1977, Michel Potay testified he witnessed five Theophanies. He published the text he says he received from God in &quot;The Book&quot;, the second part of The Revelation of Ares.

There are a large number of modern cases which have been rendered into print, film, and otherwise conveyed to broad publics. Some cases have become popular books and media, including:
* &quot;A Course in Miracles&quot; which is attested as divinely channeled
* &quot;The Attentive Heart: Conversations with Trees&quot;, in which the spirits contacted are resident in species that do not usually speak in the ordinary sense of human speech

These instances are distinguished from cases in which divine encounters are explicitly considered fictional by the author, a frequent motif in speculative fiction such as in Julian May&#x27;s &quot;Galactic Milieu Series&quot;.

<text>Andorra consists of seven communities known as parishes (, singularparròquia). Until relatively recently, it had only six parishes; the seventh, Escaldes–Engordany, was created in 1978.

==Overview==
Andorra la Vella is the capital of Andorra. Some parishes have a further territorial subdivision; Ordino, La Massana and Sant Julià de Lòria are subdivided into &quot;quarts&quot; (quarters), while Canillo is subdivided into 10 &quot;veïnats&quot; (neighborhoods). Those mostly coincide with villages, which are found in all parishes.

Each parish has its own elected mayor who is the nominal head of the local government known as a &quot;comú&quot; in Catalan.

<text>The House of Torlonia, the Princes of Civitella-Cesi, is the name of an Italian princely family from Rome, which acquired a huge fortune in the 18th and 19th centuries through administering the finances of the Vatican. The first influential member of the Torlonia family was Marino Torlonia (Tourlonias; 1725 – 21 March 1785), who rose from humble origins in the Auvergne region of France to become a very rich businessman and banker in Rome.

Marino was born with the French name of Marin Torlonias, the son of Antoine Torlonias, a merchant and laborer. Marin&#x27;s great-uncle was the parish priest of Augerolles, who procured for him a position as aide to an influential abbot. Marin eventually settled in Rome, where he became a cloth merchant and money lender near the Piazza of the Trinità dei Monti. This became the foundation of the family bank established by his son, Giovanni Torlonia.

Giovanni, in return for his able administration of the Vatican finances, was created duke of Bracciano and count of Pisciarelli by Pope Pius VI in 1794. In 1803, Pius VII made him marquess of Romavecchia e Turrita and the first prince of Civitella Cesi. He was made, among other titles, a Roman Patrician in 1809, with confirmation from the Pope on 19 January 1813, and the duke of Poli e Guadagnolo in 1820. He was the builder of the Villa Torlonia in Rome, among other Palazzo Torlonia villas. He married Anna Maria Chiaveri &quot;née&quot; Schultheiss, a widow who came from a family of southern German merchants from the city of Donaueschingen.

Leopoldo Torlonia, a grandson of Giovanni, was the Mayor of Rome from May 1882 to May 1887.

His great-grandson, Marino Torlonia succeeded to the title as 4th prínce of Civitella-Cesi, a title he inherited from Augusto, his older brother, in 1926. The title had been passed to Augusto from their paternal great-uncle, Alessandro, younger brother of Augusto&#x27;s and Marino&#x27;s grandfather, Giulio. Marino married the rich American heiress Mary Elsie Moore; they were the parents of Don Alessandro Torlonia, 5th Prince di Civitella-Cesi, who married the Infanta Beatriz of Spain, the daughter of King Alfonso XIII - one of their grandchildren is Princess Sibilla of Luxembourg; and of Donna Marina Torlonia di Civitella-Cesi, the wife of American tennis player Francis Xavier Shields and grandmother of the American actress Brooke Shields.

In Rome, the Torlonia properties comprise: Palazzo Torlonia-Giraud in Via della Conciliazione (rione of Borgo), Palazzo Núñez-Torlonia in Via Condotti, near the Spanish Steps, Palazzo Torlonia in Via della Lungara (rione of Trastevere) and Villa Torlonia (Villa Albani) outside Porta Salaria. They also owned the now demolished Palazzo Torlonia-Bolognetti near Piazza Venezia.

The Torlonia family were one of the few Italian aristocratic families to have survived the reconstruction of the Papal Court in 1969 by the motu proprio &quot;Pontificalis Domus&quot;. Until recently the only hereditary honours still in use at the Vatican are that of hereditary Prince Assistants to the Papal Throne. This honour was until recently held by Prince Alessandro Torlonia, Prince of Fucino, and Prince Marcantonio Colonna, Prince and Duke of Paliano. The Torlonia family was appointed in 1958 (its title dates from 1854 also), in succession to Prince Filippo Orsini, whose family had held the position since 1735.

A poem quoted by Ignazio Silone in his novel &quot;Fontamara&quot; (1930), at the height of their power translates as:

:The head of everything is God, the Lord of heaven
:After Him comes Prince Torlonia, lord of the earth
:Then comes Prince Torlonia&#x27;s armed guards
:Then comes Prince Torlonia&#x27;s armed guards dogs
:Then comes nothing at all. Then comes nothing at all.
:Then comes nothing at all. 
:Then come the peasants. And that&#x27;s all.

<doc id="412371" wikidata="Q1647142" url="?curid=412371" title="Parishes and dependencies of Antigua and Barbuda">
<text>Antigua and Barbuda is an island nation made up of: Antigua island, which is divided into six parishes; and of the two dependencies of Barbuda island and Redonda island.

Although Barbuda and Redonda are called dependencies, they are integral parts of the state, making them essentially administrative divisions. Dependency is simply their title. Redonda was annexed into Saint John and unlike Barbuda, is not an autonomous island, instead, it is a first-level administrative division subordinate to Saint John.

== History ==
Antigua&#x27;s first-level administrative divisions were based on Divisions, which were later joined to form the island&#x27;s five parishes. Prior to the creation of parishes, Divisions served as the basis for Antigua&#x27;s administrative divisions. Despite the fact that divisions have never been eliminated, major divisions have now taken over the role of becoming Antigua&#x27;s second-level administrative divisions.

On 24 August 1681, the five founding parishes of Antigua—Saint John, Saint Mary, Saint Paul, and Saint Philip and Saint Peter—were formally organised. In 1725, Saint Peter was divided into the Saint Peter as it is known today and Saint George.

The office of &quot;justice&quot; served as the top government official in parishes in the past; but, this role is no longer held in any parishes. Each parish also had a vestry.

== List ==
== Parish capitals ==
There are seven parish/dependency capitals in Antigua and Barbuda. One of these, St. John&#x27;s, serves as the national seat of government. Each parish capital contains the parish church, while the capital of Barbuda contains the administrative offices of the Barbuda Council. Most capitals have town status, however, Codrington is a village, Fitches Creek is an estate, and St. John&#x27;s is the sole city in the country.

With the exception of St. John&#x27;s and Codrington, the majority of parish/dependency capitals are not the largest settlements in the parish. Parham is the second-largest city in Saint Peter; that being said, it would be the largest if the population of All Saints—which is spread across three parishes—were not included. Nonetheless, compared to Parham, the population of the sector of All Saints in Saint Peter is considerably higher.

<doc id="412374" wikidata="Q3602668" url="?curid=412374" title="A Picture of Nectar">
<text>A Picture of Nectar is the third studio album by the American rock band Phish. The album was released on February 18, 1992, by Elektra Records and was the band&#x27;s debut release for a major record label.

The album is dedicated to Nector Rorris, the proprietor of Nectar&#x27;s in Burlington, Vermont, where Phish played their first bar gig followed by a series of monthly three-night stands, saying that the experience &quot;taught us how to play&quot;.

There are two versions of the album&#x27;s cover. The first printings of the CD were issued in longbox format, and the title of the album was not printed on the CD insert itself. Later printings came in shrink-wrap format and had the band&#x27;s name and album title printed directly on the insert.

The songs on &quot;A Picture of Nectar&quot; explore a variety of musical genres, including jazz, country, calypso, rock and roll and neo-psychedelia. Tracks 2, 8, 9, and 14 are instrumentals. The song &quot;Manteca&quot; is a cover of the song by jazz trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie; in Phish&#x27;s short version, the melody line is sung as a goofy nonsense phrase. &quot;Poor Heart&quot; is written in a hybrid of bluegrass and &quot;hot licks&quot; country styles. The Latin jazz instrumental &quot;The Landlady&quot; is performed in concert as both a segment of the longer piece &quot;Punch You in the Eye&quot; and as a separate song.

All songs on the album have been performed live by the band, though the instrumental tracks have become relative rarities after the mid-1990s. The short instrumental, &quot;Faht&quot;, written by drummer Jon Fishman, has only been performed live twelve times, the last in 1995.

The album was certified gold by the RIAA on November 15, 2001.

After its vinyl reissue in 2014, &quot;A Picture of Nectar&quot; charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for the first time (22 years after its release), peaking at number 110.

==Critical reception==

Allmusic staff writer Jim Smith gave the album four and a half stars out of five, noting the variety of musical genres explored on the album and calling it &quot;a surprisingly tight record for a band that built its reputation on endless concert jams&quot;.

In an April 2, 1992, review, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine raved that &quot;A Picture of Nectar&quot; &quot;...should be required on all college listening lists. The songs are all over the place from whacked-out rock to bluegrass to jazz. The constant is the high quality of musicianship and spirit that runs from track to track.&quot;

However, it is the first to have a full Impossible rating with keys included. &quot;Stash&quot; and &quot;Tweezer&quot; were also released as downloadable content for Rock Band 3 in 2011.

<doc id="412380" wikidata="Q1619268" url="?curid=412380" title="Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Classical Composition">
<text>The Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Classical Composition is an award presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, to composers for quality works of contemporary classical music. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

The award was first presented in 1961 to Aaron Copland for his &quot;Orchestral Suite from The Tender Land Suite&quot;. It was not presented from 1967 to 1984. The Grammy is awarded to the composer(s) and the librettist (if applicable) of a classical piece composed in the last 25 years, and released for the first time during the eligibility year. The performing artist, orchestra, ensemble, etc., do not receive a Grammy (except if the performer is also the composer). Since its inception, the award has had several minor name changes.

Composers John Adams, Samuel Barber, John Corigliano and Jennifer Higdon are tied for the most wins in this category, with three each. Multiple composers have won twice: Michael Daugherty, Krzysztof Penderecki, Christopher Rouse and Igor Stravinsky. In one year, 1962, the award was given to two composers, Laurindo Almeida and Stravinsky.

<text>Minsk () is an aircraft carrier (heavy aircraft cruiser in Russian classification) that served the Soviet Navy and the Russian Navy from 1978 to 1994. She was the second vessel to be built.

From 2000 to 2016 she was a theme park known as Minsk World in Shatoujiao, Yantian, Shenzhen, China.

In April 2016, &quot;Minsk&quot; was towed to Jiangsu for exhibition. On 16 August 2024, she was burnt in a fire in Nantong, Jiangsu province.

==History==

===Russian service===

Named after the capital city of Belarus, &quot;Minsk&quot; was laid down in 1972, launched on 30 September 1975, completed on 27 September 1978.

&quot;Minsk&quot; operated with the Pacific Fleet. Shortly after the Sino-Vietnamese War of 1979, &quot;Minsk&quot; was deployed to the South China Sea, making a port of call at Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam, in September 1980. She visited Vietnam again in 1982 during her second deployment before sailing onto the Indian Ocean. In 1984, &quot;Minsk&quot;, the landing ship &quot;Aleksandr Nikolayev&quot;, and Vietnam forces conducted the Soviet Navy&#x27;s first amphibious landing in Vietnam.

Soviet cosmonaut Oleg Grigoriyevich Kononenko survived an aircraft ejection on the &quot;Minsk&quot; in 1979. On September 8, 1980, he was killed in the crash of a Yakovlev Yak-38 VTOL fighter on the &quot;Minsk&quot;.

The carrier was retired, and decommissioned on 30 June 1993, as a result of a major accident (details not known) which required the facilities at the Chernomorskiy yard, in Mykolayiv, located in the newly independent Ukraine (the reasons for not attempting a repair are not known).

===Shenzhen Minsk World, China===

In 1995 &quot;Minsk&quot; was sold for scrap to a South Korean company. Due to protests from South Korean environmentalists, the ship was resold to the Chinese state-owned Guangdong Ship Dismantling Company. The ship was again saved from the scrapyard when a group of Chinese video-game arcade owners formed the Shenzhen Minsk Investment Company to buy the ship for $4.3 million.

&quot;Minsk&quot; became the centerpiece of a military theme park in Yantian district, Shatoujiao (沙头角) sub-district, Shenzhen called Minsk World. However, the Shenzhen Minsk company went bankrupt in 2006, and the carrier was put up for auction on 22 March 2006. On 31 May 2006, the carrier was sold in Shenzhen for 128 million RMB to CITIC Shenzhen.

The ship was again sold to Dalian Yongjia Group, a real estate company in Dalian in North China, on 1 January 2013. On 3 April 2016, Chinese news reported the aircraft carrier had been towed to a new destination, Zhoushan for refit, because of the decline of the number of tourists after 2006.

After the refit is completed, the ship is to be taken to Nantong on the Yangtse River in Jiangsu Province and moored to the west of Sutong Yangtze River Bridge as part of a new theme park which was planned to open in 2017. As of 2018, the project is delayed.

On 16 August 2024, the ship caught fire during further refit work in Nantong. Although the fire could be extinguished, the future of the ship as a centerpiece of another theme park became uncertain.

<text>Only Begotten Daughter is a 1990 fantasy novel by American writer James K. Morrow, setting the stage for his later &quot;Godhead Trilogy&quot;. The book shared the 1991 World Fantasy Award with Ellen Kushner&#x27;s &quot;Thomas the Rhymer&quot;. It was also nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1990, and both the Locus and John W. Campbell Memorial Awards in 1991.

== Plot ==

The story is about Julie Katz, the new Messiah, who is the daughter of God, and who is spontaneously conceived from a sperm bank donation by her father, Murray Katz, through &quot;inverse parthenogenesis&quot;. Julie struggles with her messianic powers, the mind games of Satan, being hunted by fundamentalists, and the silence of her mother, God.

This novel is a counter-theodicy similar to Morrow&#x27;s &quot;Godhead Trilogy&quot;. In addition, &quot;Only Begotten Daughter&quot; refers to God as a female throughout the book.

Inverse parthenogenesis is a baffled scientist&#x27;s explanation for the existence of an entirely unexpected ovum in Murray Katz&#x27;s latest sperm bank donation: unexpected because, as Murray himself admits, he does not know many women. (The ovum, though, apparently, has been provided the necessary Immaculate Conception.) Murray is a Jewish hermit pushing fifty, living alone in a lighthouse in Atlantic City, writing a book about human nature based on evidence gleaned from a job at the local Photomat. His closest friend is lesbian Georgina Sparks, foster-mother to Julie.

The result of these gathered abnormalities is Julie Katz, half-sister to Jesus. Well-schooled in the appropriate use of her messianic powers (she can breathe underwater, restore life to dead animals, and converse with a talking sponge named Amanda) by her only visible parent (at least as well as Murray can manage), Julie reaches adulthood and explores life, death, Hell and the universe on the East Coast of the modern United States.

She is ten years old when she meets her &quot;mother&#x27;s oldest friend&quot;, Mr. Wyvern; the plot thereafter is derived from the intervention of family, fun in the Absecon Inlet, the guiding phantom eye of an enemy, Pastor Billy Milk, his fundamentalist sheep roving Atlantic City with juice jugs of milk, and the problems posed by her extra gifts. The overarching story of the book is that of a satirical theodicy, questioning why human beings suffer from evil and pain, and exploring the ingenuity with which we combat those conditions.

Julie eventually discovers that Amanda, the talking Sponge, is very likely God, and her spiritual (if not physiological) mother. Amanda cares deeply about the planet, but lives at a distance from it, and (because she is only a sponge) is not able to affect the world beyond the occasional miracle.

== Critical response ==
Fantasy scholar Michael-Anne Rubenstien writes:

Rubenstien adds,

Jo Walton has described it as &quot;brilliant&quot;, commenting that it was &quot;worthy of Hugo nomination&quot;.

<doc id="412384" wikidata="Q1075664" url="?curid=412384" title="Port of entry">
<text>In general, a port of entry (POE) is a place where one may lawfully enter a country. It typically has border security staff and facilities to check passports and visas and to inspect luggage to assure that contraband is not imported. International airports are usually ports of entry, as are road and rail crossings on a land border. Seaports can be used as ports of entry only if a dedicated customs presence is posted there. The choice of whether to become a port of entry is up to the civil authority controlling the port.

==Airport of entry==

An airport of entry (AOE) is an airport that provides customs and immigration services for incoming flights. These services allow the airport to serve as an initial port of entry for foreign visitors arriving in a country.

===Terminology===
The word &quot;international&quot; in an airport&#x27;s name usually means that it is an airport of entry, but many airports of entry do not use it. Airports of entry can range from large urban airports with heavy scheduled passenger service, like John F. Kennedy International Airport, to small rural airports serving general aviation exclusively. Often, smaller airports of entry are located near an existing port of entry such as a bridge or seaport.

On the other hand, however, some &quot;former&quot; airports of entry chose to leave their name with the word &quot;international&quot; in it, even though they no longer serve international flights. One example is Osaka International Airport. Even when it had ended all international services and became a purely domestic airport after the opening of Kansai International Airport in 1994, it kept its original name of &quot;Osaka International Airport&quot;. Many airports in the nearby region have the same situation, like Taipei Songshan Airport. Songshan retained its official Chinese name, Taipei International Airport, after Chiang Kai-shek International Airport (now Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport) opened. Similar cases of transitions of international airports such as Seoul, Tokyo, Nagoya, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Bangkok, Tehran, etc.

For the European Union, flights between countries in the Schengen Area are considered domestic regarding passport and immigration check. Several international airports have only intra-Schengen flights. Several of these have occasional charter flights to foreign countries.

=== Stateless persons ===
Some cases of statelessness have occurred in airports of entry forcing people to live in the airport for an extended period. One of the most famous cases was that of Mehran Karimi Nasseri, an Iranian national who lived in the Charles de Gaulle Airport in France for approximately eighteen years after being denied entry into France and not having a country of origin to be returned to due to claiming his Iranian nationality had been revoked. Nasseri&#x27;s experience was loosely adapted by two films, the 1993 film &quot;Tombés du ciel&quot; and the 2004 film &quot;The Terminal&quot;. Zahra Kamalfar, an Iranian national who attempted to travel to Canada via Russia and Germany using forged documents, lived in the Sheremetyevo International Airport in Russia for eleven months before being granted refugee status by Canada to reunite with her family in Vancouver.

==In the United States==
The formal definition of a port of entry in the United States is something entirely different. According to the Code of Federal Regulations, &quot;the terms &#x27;port&#x27; and &#x27;port of entry&#x27; incorporate the geographical area under the jurisdiction of a port director.&quot; In other words, a port of entry may encompass an area that includes several border crossings, as well as some air and sea ports. This also means that not every border crossing is a port of entry. There are two reasons for this: 
* Every port of entry must have a Port Director, which is a higher pay grade than a typical border inspector. The U.S. government has determined that some small border crossings do not need their own Port Directors. As a result, border outposts like Churubusco, Chateaugay and Fort Covington, New York are considered &quot;stations&quot; within the Trout River Port of Entry.
* Historically, many roads entering the U.S. had no border inspection station. Before September 11, 2001, it was permissible for persons entering the U.S. to do so at any point (including back roads or closed border stations), as long as they proceeded directly to an open border inspection station. In fact, the U.S. Customs Service and U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service routinely rented property in houses, post offices, and storefronts far from the physical border, and people entering the U.S. were expected to travel to these locations without stopping so they could make their declarations. This policy has since changed, and most of the roads entering the U.S. at locations other than an open and staffed border inspection station have since been barricaded.

==Variations==
In some countries, immigration procedures are carried out by the armed forces rather than specific immigration officers. However, in most, the levying of duty on imports is still carried out by customs officers. Immigration clearance in some ports of entry have automated sections open to the country&#x27;s own residents or citizens, such as the e-Channel found in Hong Kong and Macau, Global Entry found at some airports in the United States and other similar country-instituted programs.

On some international borders, the concept of a port of entry does not exist or is at least not applied to select countries of free-crossing pacts. Travelers may cross the border wherever and whenever convenient. For example, and as such a pact, most EU citizens may travel freely within the Schengen Area, which is made up of 29 European countries. As with the example, in some cases, such free travel may be restricted to citizens of specific countries and to travelers who are not carrying goods over the customs limits; others may only cross the border at a designated border crossing during its opening times.

<text>The Grammy Award for Best Classical Album was awarded from 1962 to 2011. The award had several minor name changes:

*From 1962 to 1963, 1965 to 1972 and 1974 to 1976 the award was known as Album of the Year – Classical
*In 1964 and 1977 it was awarded as Classical Album of the Year
*In 1973 and from 1978 onward it was awarded as Best Classical Album

The award was discontinued in 2012 in a major overhaul of Grammy categories. From then on, recordings in this category fall under the Album of the Year category. 

Years reflect the year in which the Grammy Awards were presented, for works released in the previous year.

<text>The Grammy Award for Best Classical Crossover Album was awarded from 1999 to 2011.

The award was discontinued from 2012 in a major overhaul of Grammy categories. In the present day, if a classical crossover release is a non-classical artist making a classical album it should be entered in the appropriate classical category. If the release is a classical artist making a non-classical album it should be entered in the appropriate genre category (Pop, New Age, Jazz, etc.)

<text>In music, a pitch class (p.c. or pc) is a set of all pitches that are a whole number of octaves apart; for example, the pitch class C consists of the Cs in all octaves. &quot;The pitch class C stands for all possible Cs, in whatever octave position.&quot; Important to musical set theory, a pitch class is &quot;all pitches related to each other by octave, enharmonic equivalence, or both.&quot; Thus, using scientific pitch notation, the pitch class &quot;C&quot; is the set

:{C&quot;n&quot; : &quot;n&quot; is an integer} = {..., C−2, C−1, C0, C1, C2, C3, ...}.

Although there is no formal upper or lower limit to this sequence, only a few of these pitches are audible to humans. 
Pitch class is important because human pitch-perception is periodic: pitches belonging to the same pitch class are perceived as having a similar quality or color, a property called &quot;octave equivalence&quot;.

Psychologists refer to the quality of a pitch as its &quot;chroma&quot;. A &quot;chroma&quot; is an attribute of pitches (as opposed to &quot;tone height&quot;), just like hue is an attribute of color. A &quot;pitch class&quot; is a set of all pitches that share the same chroma, just like &quot;the set of all white things&quot; is the collection of all white objects.

In standard Western equal temperament, distinct spellings can refer to the same sounding object: B3, C4, and D4 all refer to the same pitch, hence share the same chroma, and therefore belong to the same pitch class. This phenomenon is called enharmonic equivalence.

==Integer notation==
To avoid the problem of enharmonic spellings, theorists typically represent pitch classes using numbers beginning from zero, with each successively larger integer representing a pitch class that would be one semitone higher than the preceding one, if they were all realised as actual pitches in the same octave. Because octave-related pitches belong to the same class, when an octave is reached, the numbers begin again at zero. This cyclical system is referred to as modular arithmetic and, in the usual case of chromatic twelve-tone scales, pitch-class numbering is &quot;modulo 12&quot; (customarily abbreviated &quot;mod 12&quot; in the music-theory literature)—that is, every twelfth member is identical. One can map a pitch&#x27;s fundamental frequency &quot;f&quot; (measured in hertz) to a real number &quot;p&quot; using the equation

:formula_1

This creates a linear pitch space in which octaves have size 12, semitones (the distance between adjacent keys on the piano keyboard) have size 1, and middle C (C4) is assigned the number 0 (thus, the pitches on piano are −39 to +48). Indeed, the mapping from pitch to real numbers defined in this manner forms the basis of the MIDI Tuning Standard, which uses the real numbers from 0 to 127 to represent the pitches C−1 to G9 (thus, middle C is 60). To represent pitch &quot;classes&quot;, we need to identify or &quot;glue together&quot; all pitches belonging to the same pitch class—i.e. all numbers &quot;p&quot; and &quot;p&quot; + 12. The result is a cyclical quotient group that music theorists call pitch class space and mathematicians call R/12Z. Points in this space can be labelled using real numbers in the range 0 ≤ &quot;x&quot; &lt; 12. These numbers provide numerical alternatives to the letter names of elementary music theory: 

:0 = C, 1 = C/D, 2 = D, 2.5 = D (quarter tone sharp), 3 = D/E,

and so on. In this system, pitch classes represented by integers are classes of twelve-tone equal temperament (assuming standard concert A).

In music, integer notation is the translation of pitch classes or interval classes into whole numbers. Thus if C = 0, then C = 1 ... A = 10, B = 11, with &quot;10&quot; and &quot;11&quot; substituted by &quot;t&quot; and &quot;e&quot; in some sources, &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; in others (like the duodecimal numeral system, which also uses &quot;t&quot; and &quot;e&quot;, or &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, for &quot;10&quot; and &quot;11&quot;). This allows the most economical presentation of information regarding post-tonal materials.

In the integer model of pitch, all pitch classes and intervals between pitch classes are designated using the numbers 0 through 11. It is not used to notate music for performance, but is a common analytical and compositional tool when working with chromatic music, including twelve tone, serial, or otherwise atonal music.

Pitch classes can be notated in this way by assigning the number 0 to some note and assigning consecutive integers to consecutive semitones; so if 0 is C natural, 1 is C, 2 is D and so on up to 11, which is B. The C above this is not 12, but 0 again (12 − 12 = 0). Thus arithmetic modulo 12 is used to represent octave equivalence. One advantage of this system is that it ignores the &quot;spelling&quot; of notes (B, C and D are all 0) according to their diatonic functionality.

===Disadvantages===
There are a few disadvantages with integer notation. First, theorists have traditionally used the same integers to indicate elements of different tuning systems. Thus, the numbers 0, 1, 2, ... 5, are used to notate pitch classes in 6-tone equal temperament. This means that the meaning of a given integer changes with the underlying tuning system: &quot;1&quot; can refer to C in 12-tone equal temperament, but D in 6-tone equal temperament.

Also, the same numbers are used to represent both pitches and intervals. For example, the number 4 serves both as a label for the pitch class E (if C = 0) and as a label for the &quot;distance&quot; between the pitch classes D and F. (In much the same way, the term &quot;10 degrees&quot; can label both a temperature and the distance between two temperatures.) Only one of these labelings is sensitive to the (arbitrary) choice of pitch class 0. For example, if one makes a different choice about which pitch class is labeled 0, then the pitch class E will no longer be labeled &quot;4&quot;. However, the distance between D and F will still be assigned the number 4. Both this and the issue in the paragraph directly above may be viewed as disadvantages (though mathematically, an element &quot;4&quot; should not be confused with the function &quot;+4&quot;).

==Other ways to label pitch classes==
The system described above is flexible enough to describe any pitch class in any tuning system: for example, one can use the numbers {0, 2.4, 4.8, 7.2, 9.6} to refer to the five-tone scale that divides the octave evenly. However, in some contexts, it is convenient to use alternative labeling systems. For example, in just intonation, we may express pitches in terms of positive rational numbers , expressed by reference to a 1 (often written &quot;&quot;), which represents a fixed pitch. If &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are two positive rational numbers, they belong to the same pitch class if and only if

:formula_2

for some integer &quot;n&quot;. Therefore, we can represent pitch classes in this system using ratios where neither &quot;p&quot; nor &quot;q&quot; is divisible by 2, that is, as ratios of odd integers. Alternatively, we can represent just intonation pitch classes by reducing to the octave, 1 ≤  &lt; 2.

It is also very common to label pitch classes with reference to some scale. For example, one can label the pitch classes of &quot;n&quot;-tone equal temperament using the integers 0 to &quot;n&quot; − 1. In much the same way, one could label the pitch classes of the C major scale, C–D–E–F–G–A–B, using the numbers from 0 to 6. This system has two advantages over the continuous labeling system described above. First, it eliminates any suggestion that there is something natural about a twelvefold division of the octave. Second, it avoids pitch-class universes with unwieldy decimal expansions when considered relative to 12; for example, in the continuous system, the pitch-classes of 19 equal temperament are labeled 0.63158..., 1.26316..., etc. Labeling these pitch classes {0, 1, 2, 3 ..., 18} simplifies the arithmetic used in pitch-class set manipulations.

The disadvantage of the scale-based system is that it assigns an infinite number of different names to chords that sound identical. For example, in twelve-tone equal-temperament the C major triad is notated {0, 4, 7}. In twenty-four-tone equal-temperament, this same triad is labeled {0, 8, 14}. Moreover, the scale-based system appears to suggest that different tuning systems use steps of the same size (&quot;1&quot;) but have octaves of differing size (&quot;12&quot; in 12-tone equal-temperament, &quot;19&quot; in 19-tone equal temperament, and so on), whereas in fact the opposite is true: different tuning systems divide the same octave into different-sized steps.

In general, it is often more useful to use the traditional integer system when one is working within a single temperament; when one is comparing chords in different temperaments, the continuous system can be more useful.

<text>Azerbaijan is administratively divided into 67 districts () and 11 cities () that are subordinate to the Republic. Out of these districts and cities, 7 districts and 1 city are located within the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The districts are further divided into municipalities ().

Additionally, the districts of Azerbaijan are grouped into 14 Economic Regions (). On 7 July 2021, President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev signed a decree &quot;On the new division of economic regions in the Republic of Azerbaijan&quot;.

== Administrative divisions ==
=== Contiguous Azerbaijan ===

The list below represents the districts of contiguous Azerbaijan. For those of the Nakhchivan exclave, see further below.


=== Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic ===
The seven districts and one municipality of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic are listed below.

== Economic regions ==


== Nagorno-Karabakh ==
The territory of former Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast presently consists of the districts of Khojavend, Shusha, Khojaly, the eastern portion of Kalbajar and the western portion of Tartar. The Autonomous Oblast was abolished on 26 November 1991, by the Supreme Soviet of the Azerbaijan SSR. Since then, the territory of the autonomous oblast has been administratively split between the aforementioned districts.

As a result of the First Nagorno-Karabakh War, most of Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding districts came under the occupation of ethnic Armenian forces. The self-proclaimed Republic of Artsakh also controlled a large part of southwestern Azerbaijan outside Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan regained control of all of the surrounding districts and large parts of Nagorno-Karabakh following the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war. Azerbaijan regained control of all of Nagorno-Karabakh following 2023 Nagorno-Karabakh clashes.

<text>The Grammy Award for Best New Classical Artist was an honor presented to classical artists in 1964, 1965, 1966 and 1986. The Grammy Awards, an annual ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, are presented by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

The award was first known as Most Promising New Classical Recording Artist was first presented to André Watts at the 6th Grammy Awards in 1964. The honor was presented for additional years until being discontinued before the 1967 ceremony. The award category re-emerged in 1986 with the name Best New Classical Artist and was presented to Chicago Pro Musica. As of 2023, the award has not been presented since 1986.

In 1963 NARAS representative John Scott Trotter announced that three new award categories—Best Album Notes, Best Original Score from a Motion Picture or Television Show, and Most Promising New Classical Recording Artist—would be introduced at the following ceremony. Most Promising New Classical Recording Artist nominees for the 6th Grammy Awards (1964) included André Watts for &quot;Liszt: Concerto No. 1 for Piano and Orchestra&quot; (with Leonard Bernstein conducting the New York Philharmonic). The award was presented to Watts at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City.

For the 7th Grammy Awards (1965), nominees included Marilyn Horne for &quot;The Age of Bel Canto: Operatic Scenes&quot; (Bonynge, conductor). The award was presented to Horne. The classical radio station WQXR-FM included Horne&#x27;s win in their list of the &quot;Top 5 Classical Events of 1964–65&quot;, claiming her &quot;triumphant debut&quot; at Covent Garden as the character Marie in Alban Berg&#x27;s opera &quot;Wozzeck&quot; along with her 1964 recording of Vincenzo Bellini&#x27;s opera &quot;Norma&quot; with Joan Sutherland contributed to her success.

Nominees for the 8th Grammy Awards (1966) included Peter Serkin for &quot;Bach: Goldberg Variations&quot;. The honor was presented to Serkin, the teenage pianist son of Rudolf Serkin, in New York City. Serkin was later nominated for Best Classical Vocal Performance at the 52nd Grammy Awards (2010) for his work on the album &quot;Recital at Ravinia&quot; (with Lorraine Hunt Lieberson).

===1986===
Best New Classical Artist nominees for the 28th Grammy Awards (1986) included soprano Sarah Brightman for her work in Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot;, Chicago Pro Musica for Stravinsky: L&#x27; Histoire Du Soldat (The Soldier&#x27;s Tale - Suite) and Walton: Façade (An Instrumental Suite in the Original Scoring), Rosalind Plowright, Finnish conductor Esa-Pekka Salonen, and Brian Slawson for the album &quot;Bach on Wood&quot;. Salonen was considered a strong contender by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine.

The award was presented to Chicago Pro Musica, which recorded for a company called Reference.

<text>Consanguinity (from Latin &quot;consanguinitas&quot; &#x27;blood relationship&#x27;) is the characteristic of having a kinship with a relative who is descended from a common ancestor.

Many jurisdictions have laws prohibiting people who are closely related by blood from marrying or having sexual relations with each other. The degree of consanguinity that gives rise to this prohibition varies from place to place. On the other hand, around 20% of the global population lives in areas where some consanguinous marriages are preferred. The degree of relationships are also used to determine heirs of an estate according to statutes that govern intestate succession, which also vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In some communities and time periods, cousin marriage is allowed or even encouraged; in others, it is taboo, and considered to be incest.

The degree of relative consanguinity can be illustrated with a &quot;consanguinity table&quot; in which each level of lineal consanguinity (&quot;generation&quot; or &quot;meiosis&quot;) appears as a row, and individuals with a collaterally consanguineous relationship share the same row. The Knot System is a numerical notation that describes consanguinity using the Ahnentafel numbers of shared ancestors.

== Legal definitions ==

===Modern secular law===
The degree of kinship between two people may give rise to several legal issues. Some laws prohibit sexual relations between closely related people, referred to as incestuous. Laws may also bar marriage between closely related people, which are almost universally prohibited to the second degree of consanguinity. Some jurisdictions forbid marriage between first cousins, while others do not. Marriage with aunts and uncles (avunculate marriage) is legal in several countries.

Consanguinity is also relevant to inheritance, particularly with regard to intestate succession. In general, laws tend to favor inheritance by persons closely related to the deceased. Some jurisdictions ban citizens from service on a jury on the basis of consanguinity as well as affinity with persons involved in the case. In many countries, laws prohibiting nepotism ban employment of, or certain kinds of contracts with, the near relations of public officers or employees.

===Religious and traditional law===
====Judaism====
====Christianity====
Under Roman civil law, which the early canon law of the Catholic Church followed, couples were forbidden to marry if they were within four degrees of consanguinity. Around the ninth century the church raised the number of prohibited degrees to seven and changed the method by which they were calculated; instead of the former Roman practice of counting each generational link up to the common ancestor and then down again to the proposed spouse, the new method computed consanguinity only by counting back the number of generations to the common ancestor. Intermarriage was now prohibited to anyone more closely related than seventh cousins, which meant that in particular the nobility struggled to find partners to marry, the pool of non-related prospective spouses having become substantially smaller. They had to either defy the church&#x27;s position or look elsewhere for eligible marriage candidates. In the Roman Catholic Church, unknowingly marrying a closely consanguineous blood relative was grounds for a declaration of nullity, but during the eleventh and twelfth centuries dispensations were granted with increasing frequency due to the thousands of persons encompassed in the prohibition at seven degrees and the hardships this posed for finding potential spouses.

In 1215, the Fourth Lateran Council made what they believed was a necessary change to canon law reducing the number of prohibited degrees of consanguinity from seven back to four, but retaining the later method of calculating degrees. After 1215, the general rule was that fourth cousins could marry without dispensation, greatly reducing the need for dispensations. In fourteenth century England, for example, papal dispensations for annulments due to consanguinity (and affinity) were relatively few.

The ban on marriage to minor degrees of relationship imposed by the Roman Catholic Church was met with heavy criticism in the Croatian society in the 11th century, which led to a schism in the Croatian church.

Among the Christian &quot;Habesha&quot; highlanders of Ethiopia and Eritrea (the predominantly orthodox Christian Amhara and Tigray-Tigrinya), it is a tradition to be able to recount one&#x27;s paternal ancestors at least seven generations away starting from early childhood, because &quot;those with a common patrilineal ancestor less than seven generations away are considered &#x27;brother and sister&#x27; and may not marry.&quot; The rule is less strict on the mother&#x27;s side, where the limit is about four generations back, but still determined patrilinearly. This rule does not apply to Muslims or other ethnic groups.

====Islam====

The Quran at 4:22–24 states. &quot;Forbidden to you in marriage are: your mothers, your daughters, your sisters, your father&#x27;s sisters, your mother&#x27;s sisters, your brother&#x27;s daughters, your sister&#x27;s daughters.&quot; Therefore, the list of forbidden marriage partners, as read in the Qur&#x27;an, Surah 4:23, does not include first cousins. Muhammad himself married his first cousin Zaynab bint Jahsh.

Financial incentives to discourage consanguineous marriages exist in some countries: mandatory premarital screening for inherited blood disorders has existed in the UAE since 2004 and in Qatar since 2009, whereby couples with positive results will not receive their marriage grant.

== Genetic definitions ==


Genetically, consanguinity derives from the reduction in variation due to meiosis that occurs because of the smaller number of near ancestors. Since all humans share between 99.6% and 99.9% of their genome, consanguinity only affects a very small part of the sequence. If two siblings have a child, the child has only two rather than four grandparents. In these circumstances, the probability is increased that the child will inherit two copies of a harmful recessive gene (allele) (rather than only one, which is less likely to have harmful effects).

Genetic consanguinity is expressed as defined in 1922 by Wright with the coefficient of relationship &quot;r&quot;, where &quot;r&quot; is defined as the fraction of homozygous due to the consanguinity under discussion. Thus, a parent and child pair has a value of &quot;r&quot;=0.5 (sharing 50% of DNA), siblings have a value of &quot;r&quot;=0.5, a parent&#x27;s sibling has &quot;r&quot;=0.25 (25% of DNA), and first cousins have &quot;r&quot;=0.125 (12.5% of DNA). These are often expressed in terms of a percentage of shared DNA but can be also popularly referred to as % of genes although that terminology is technically incorrect.

As a working definition, unions contracted between persons biologically related as second cousins or closer (&quot;r&quot; ≥ 0.03125) are categorized as consanguineous. This arbitrary limit has been chosen because the genetic influence in marriages between couples related to a lesser degree would usually be expected to differ only slightly from that observed in the general population. Globally it is estimated that at least 8.5% of children have consanguineous parents.

In clinical genetics, consanguinity is defined as a union between two individuals who are related as second cousins or closer, with the inbreeding coefficient (F) equal or higher than 0.0156, where (F) represents the proportion of genetic loci at which the child of a consanguineous couple might inherit identical gene copies from both parents.

It is common to identify one&#x27;s first- and second-degree cousins, and sometimes third-degree cousins. It is seldom possible to identify fourth-degree cousins, since few people can trace their full family tree back more than four generations. (Nor is it considered important, since fourth cousins tend to be genetically no more similar to each other than they are to any other individual from the same region.)

== Epidemiology, rates of occurrence ==
===Cultural factors in favor===
Reasons favoring consanguinous marriage have been listed as higher compatibility between husband and wife sharing same social relationships, couples stability, enforcing family solidarity, easier financial negotiations and others. Consanguinity is a deeply rooted phenomenon in 20% of the world population, mostly in the Middle East, West Asia and North Africa. Globally, the most common form of consanguineous union is between first cousins, in which the spouses share of their genes inherited from a common ancestor, and so their progeny are homozygous (or more correctly autozygous) at of all loci (&quot;r&quot; = 0.0625). Due to variation in geographical and ethnic background and the loci chosen to genotype there is some 2.4% variation expected.

=== Europe ===
Historically, some European nobles cited a close degree of consanguinity when they required convenient grounds for divorce, especially in contexts where religious doctrine forbade the voluntary dissolution of an unhappy or childless marriage.

=== Muslim countries ===
In the Arab world, the practice of marrying relatives is common. According to the Centre for Arabic Genomic Research, between 40% and 54% of UAE nationals&#x27; marriages are between family members, up from 39% in the previous generation. Between 21% and 28% of marriages of UAE nationals were between first cousins. Consanguineous marriage is much less prevalent in Christian Arabs as they do not practice arranged marriages. Additionally, an indult dispensation is required to marriages contracted between first cousins or closer in Arab Christian denominations in communion with the Roman Catholic Church, and the Greek Orthodox Church; there are no similar regulations that apply to first-cousin marriages in the Coptic Orthodox Church.

In Egypt, around 40% of the population marry a cousin. A 1992 survey in Jordan found that 32% were married to a first cousin; a further 17.3% were married to more distant relatives. 67% of marriages in Saudi Arabia are between close relatives as are 54% of all marriages in Kuwait, whereas 18% of all Lebanese were between blood relatives. The incidence of consanguinity was 54.3% among Kuwaiti natives and higher among Bedouins.

It has been estimated that 55% of marriages between Pakistani Muslim immigrants in the United Kingdom are between first cousins, where preferential patrilateral parallel cousin marriage, i.e. a man marrying the daughter of his father&#x27;s brother, is favored.

Double first cousins are descended from two pairs of siblings, and have the same genetic similarity as half-siblings. In unions between double first cousins, the highest inbreeding coefficients are reached, with an (F) of 0.125, for example among Arabs and uncle-niece marriages in South India.

=== Quebec ===
The early days of colonization, particularly from 1660 to 1680, gave French Canadians genetic traits that are still present today, owing to the isolation and low population of the early colony. This has led to the province having a higher rate of hypercholesterolemia, tyrosinemia, spastic ataxia, intestinal atresia, myotonic dystrophy, etc., in the population than anywhere else in the world.

== Genetic disorders ==

The phenomenon of inbreeding increases the level of homozygotes for autosomal genetic disorders and generally leads to a decreased biological fitness of a population known as inbreeding depression, a major objective in clinical studies. While the risks of inbreeding are well-known, informing minority group families with a tradition of endogamy and changing their behavior is a challenging task for genetic counseling in the health care system. The offspring of consanguineous relationships are at greater risk of certain genetic disorders. Autosomal recessive disorders occur in individuals who are homozygous for a particular recessive gene mutation. This means that they carry two copies (alleles) of the same gene. Except in certain rare circumstances (new mutations or uniparental disomy) both parents of an individual with such a disorder will be carriers of the gene. Such carriers are not affected and will not display any signs that they are carriers, and so may be unaware that they carry the mutated gene. As relatives share a proportion of their genes, it is much more likely that related parents will be carriers of an autosomal recessive gene, and therefore their children are at a higher risk of an autosomal recessive disorder. The extent to which the risk increases depends on the degree of genetic relationship between the parents; so the risk is greater in mating relationships where the parents are close relatives, but for relationships between more distant relatives, such as second cousins, the risk is lower (although still greater than the general population).

Consanguinity in a population increases its susceptibility to many infectious pathogens such as tuberculosis and hepatitis, but may decrease its susceptibility to malaria and some other pathogens.

<text>Osgoode Hall Law School, commonly shortened to Osgoode, is the law school of York University in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is home to the Law Commission of Ontario, the &quot;Journal of Law and Social Policy&quot;, and the &quot;Osgoode Hall Law Journal&quot;. A variety of J.D. LL.M. and Ph.D. degrees in law are available.

The law school&#x27;s alumni include three Canadian prime ministers, three Attorneys General, eight premiers of Ontario, four Mayors of Toronto, eleven Justices of the Supreme Court of Canada, four of whom were Chief Justices, and one Academy Award nominee. The current dean of the law school is Trevor C.W. Farrow.

== History ==
Osgoode Hall was named for William Osgoode, an Oxford University graduate and barrister of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. He was the first person to serve as the chief justice of Upper Canada.

The law school traces its origins back to the 1820s, and it counts the first Canadian prime minister (Sir John A. Macdonald) among its graduates.&lt;ref name=&quot;https://www.osgoode.yorku.ca/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It was reorganized in 1889, and the Law Society of Upper Canada permanently established the law school on the site now known as Osgoode Hall. At the time, it was the only law school in Ontario, and this remained the case until the establishment of the University of Toronto Faculty of Law in 1949.

Ontario lawyers were originally required to attend Osgoode Hall in order to practise in the province. In 1855, the Law Society began requiring members to attend lectures given at Osgoode Hall (the building). In 1862, a law school opened in that building, only to close in 1868. It frequently opened and closed throughout the late 19th century. The law school at Osgoode Hall was only titled &quot;Osgoode Hall Law School&quot; in March 1924, when the Law Society of Upper Canada formally assigned it that name.

The school signed an agreement of affiliation with York University in 1965. It relocated from the Osgoode Hall building in downtown Toronto to York University&#x27;s Keele Campus in 1968.

==Rankings and reputation==

Osgoode Hall is one of the most elite law schools in Canada. Times Higher Education ranked Osgoode Hall Law School 43 in the world in 2021. Its long and distinguished history has led to a lay prestige that is unmatched by any other Canadian law school. In 2022, Osgoode&#x27;s joint JD/MBA program with the Schulich School of Business was named among the top 10 business and law programs in North America by FIND MBA.

In its most recent rankings, &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine has ranked Osgoode second amongst Canadian law schools. In the 2008 rankings published by &quot;Canadian Lawyer Magazine&quot;, Osgoode was ranked first in Canada, and was awarded high marks for the quality of its professors, flexible curriculum, and the diversity and relevance of course offerings. The faculty has been described as the &quot;strongest in the country,&quot; and rank number one in Canada for faculty journal citations.

In the 2022-2023 year, 3600 applicants applied for the 290 spots available in the first year program, resulting in an acceptance rate of around 8%. The only North American law school with a lower rate of acceptance is Yale Law School.

==Original building and current facilities==

For its first eight decades, Osgoode Hall Law School was located at Osgoode Hall at the corner of Queen Street and University Avenue. The structures at Queen and University (the earliest dating from 1832) are still known as Osgoode Hall. They remain the headquarters of the Law Society of Upper Canada, house the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the Divisional Court of the Superior Court of Justice, the offices of the Law Society of Ontario and the Great Library of the Law Society.

Currently, the law school is located on the Keele Campus of York University, in the Toronto suburb of North York. In May 2007, Dean Monahan announced plans for an extensive renovation and extension of Osgoode Hall Law School involving a renovation of the existing building, and the addition of an additional wing. The building was designed by architect Jack Diamond with the construction of the renovated building beginning in the summer of 2009. The project had been majorly funded by a $2.5 million gift by Ignat Kaneff, and the building has been renamed in his honour. The law school is referred to by York as its faculty of law. Osgoode&#x27;s Professional Development offices and classrooms are based at 1 Dundas Street West in Downtown Toronto, overlooking Yonge-Dundas Square.

==Student life==
The Legal &amp; Literary Society, Osgoode Hall Law School&#x27;s official student society, coordinates student activities both on and off campus. The organization also funds the student newspaper, &quot;Obiter Dicta,&quot; along with over fifty student clubs, with notable examples including the Osgoode Hall Criminal Law Society and the Osgoode Constitutional Law Society (OCLS), which was founded in 2014.

Osgoode hosts Professional Development Programs (OPD) which are located in downtown Toronto at 1 Dundas Street near the original Osgoode Hall building.

<text>USS &quot;Sealion&quot; (SS/SSP/ASSP/APSS/LPSS-315), a , was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the sea lion, any of several large, eared seals native to the Pacific.
She is sometimes referred to as Sealion II, because her first skipper, Lieutenant Commander Eli Thomas Reich, was a veteran of the first , serving on her when she was lost at the beginning of World War II. &quot;Sealion&quot; was the only US and Allied submarine that sank an enemy battleship during the Second World War.

Her keel was laid down on 25 February 1943 by the Electric Boat Company of Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 31 October 1943 sponsored by Mrs. Emory S. Land, and commissioned on 8 March 1944.

==World War II==

Following the shakedown, &quot;Sealion&quot;, assigned to Submarine Division 222 (SubDiv 222), sailed for the Pacific and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 17 May 1944. Further training occupied the next three weeks, and on 8 June, she headed west on her first war patrol. Sailing with , she stopped off at Midway Atoll on 12 June, glanced off a whale on 15 June, and on 22 June, transited Tokara Strait to enter the East China Sea. On 23 June, she and &quot;Tang&quot; took up stations in the Ōsumi Islands, an island group to the south of Kyūshū. That afternoon, &quot;Sealion&quot; unsuccessfully conducted her first attack, then underwent her first depth charging. On 24 June, joined the two submarines; and the group moved northward to patrol the approaches to Sasebo. Patrolling in adjacent lanes, the submarines contacted a convoy on 25 June, but &quot;Sealion&quot; lost depth control on reaching attack position and was unable to fire.

From the Sasebo area, the submarines moved toward the Korean peninsula. On 28 June, &quot;Sealion&quot; caught and sank a Japanese naval transport, &quot;Sansei Maru&quot;, in the Tsushima Island area; then continued on into the Korean archipelago. On 30 June, she used her deck guns to sink a sampan, and, with the new month, July, she moved closer to the China coast to patrol the approaches to Shanghai. On the morning of 6 July, &quot;Sealion&quot; intercepted a convoy south of the Four Sisters Islands and, at 04:47 commenced firing torpedoes at two merchant ships in the formation. Within minutes, &quot;Setsuzan Maru&quot; sank, and the convoy scattered. &quot;Sealion&quot; retired to the northeast to evade the convoy&#x27;s escort, a destroyer, as it began its search for the submarine. At 06:00, the destroyer closed &quot;Sealion&quot;, and the submarine launched four torpedoes at the warship. All missed. An hour later enemy aircraft joined the search which was continued until mid-afternoon, and &quot;Sealion&quot; escaped unscathed.

Three days later, &quot;Sealion&quot; moved northward again and commenced hunting between the Shandong peninsula and Korea. Dense fog blanketed the area and left her blind while her radar was out of commission. By midnight on the night of 10–11 July, however, her radar was back in partial operation; and, on the morning of 11 July, she conducted several attacks, sinking two freighters, &quot;Tsukushi Maru Number 2&quot; and &quot;Taian Maru Number 2&quot;. The running surface chase with the second freighter involved three attacks over a period of almost seven hours. On the third attack, at 07:11, &quot;Sealion&quot; fired her last torpedo; then, after debris from the explosion had flown over the submarine, she moved down the port quarter of the target, pouring 20 mm shells into the Japanese bridge. At 07:14, the freighter disappeared, and &quot;Sealion&quot; headed south of Tokara Strait. On 13 July, she cleared that strait and, on 21 July, she arrived at Midway Island.

Refitted by , &quot;Sealion&quot; departed for the Bashi Channel on her second war patrol on 17 August. Hunting with and , she transited the channel and moved into the South China Sea on 30 August. During the pre-dawn hours of 31 August, she conducted a night surface attack against a Japanese convoy and heavily damaged a tanker. As &quot;Rikko Maru&quot; billowed black smoke, other Japanese ships took &quot;Sealion&quot; under fire with deck guns. The submarine moved out of the area and executed an end-around to take position ahead of the convoy. At 07:20, she again attacked the convoy. Within minutes, went down; enemy planes began circling the area and the convoy&#x27;s surface escorts began their search. &quot;Sealion&quot; went deep and headed south. Later that day, she closed another target with a merchant ship appearance, but as she reached firing position, the target was made out to be an antisubmarine vessel. Three torpedoes were fired, but were spotted by the target&#x27;s bow lookout. The target evaded the torpedoes and the hunter became the hunted. Depth charging followed without damage to the submarine; but &quot;Sealion&quot;, low on fuel and torpedoes, headed for Saipan.

There, the submarine rearmed and refueled. On 7 September, &quot;Sealion&quot; got underway to rejoin her attack group. On 10 September, she moved through Balintang Channel. On 11 September, she rendezvoused with two other submarines, and on 12 September, the group attacked and decimated a convoy en route to Formosa. This was achieved through American code breakers deciphering a coded message. The convoy carried Australian and British prisoners of war (POWs) from the infamous Thai Burma Railway. At about 02:00, &quot;Growler&quot; attacked the formation. &quot;Pampanito&quot; and &quot;Sealion&quot; followed suit. &quot;Growler&quot;″s torpedoes sent the destroyer to the bottom. &quot;Sealion&quot; launched two torpedoes, both misses, and was taken under fire by two of the escorts. The submarine went to top speed and managed to keep ahead of the escorts until they broke off to rejoin the convoy shortly before 03:30.

An hour and a half later, &quot;Sealion&quot; again closed the convoy. At 05:22, she launched three torpedoes at a tanker; then swung to fire on , the last ship in the nearer column. At 05:24, &quot;Zuihō Maru&quot;, possibly hit by torpedoes from both &quot;Pampanito&quot; and &quot;Sealion&quot;, burst into flames. was disabled. She swung into the burning tanker and soon was also ablaze. &quot;Sealion&quot;″s second target was illuminated, and at 05:25, she fired on &quot;Rakuyo Maru&quot;. Both torpedoes hit and that ship began to burn. The sinking of &quot;Rakuyo Maru&quot; and &quot;Kachidoki Maru&quot; resulted in the death of nearly 1,200 Australian and British POWs. &quot;Sealion&quot; was then forced to go deep. After several attempts to get a better look at the scene, she cleared the area and started after the remainder of the convoy.

On the morning of 15 September, the three submarines reformed their scouting line. That afternoon, &quot;Pampanito&quot; radioed &quot;Sealion&quot; and other submarines in the area, to return to the scene of the action on 12 September. &quot;Rakuyo Maru&quot; had been carrying Australian and British POWs, 1,159 of whom were killed in the attack or by the effects of the attack. By 20:45, &quot;Sealion&quot; had taken on 54 POWs and started back to Saipan. All of the POWs were coated with crude oil and all were in poor health suffering from malaria, malnutritional diseases such as pellagra and beriberi, and exposure. Three died before the submarine reached Balintang Channel on 17 September. On 18 September, rendezvoused with &quot;Sealion&quot; and transferred a doctor and a pharmacist&#x27;s mate to the submarine. On 19 September, a fourth POW died, and on 20 September, &quot;Sealion&quot; arrived in Tanapag Harbor and transferred the surviving 50 rescued POWs to the United States Army hospital there. 

From Saipan, &quot;Sealion&quot; returned to Hawaii. Arriving at Pearl Harbor on 30 September, she departed again on 31 October, and with , headed west to patrol in the East China Sea. The two submarines stopped off at Midway Island on 4 November, then continued on to their patrol area. Ten days later, &quot;Sealion&quot; transited Tokara Strait. On 16 November, her number 8 tube was accidentally fired with both doors closed. Heavy seas prevented a thorough inspection of the damage. On 17 November, she began patrolling the approaches to Shanghai. On 18 November, there was a hydrogen explosion in the battery space of the torpedo in number 5 tube.

===Sinking of &quot;Kongō&quot; and &quot;Urakaze&quot;===
At 00:20 on 21 November, she made radar contact with an enemy formation moving through the Taiwan Strait at about and not zig-zagging. By 00:48, the pips were made out to be two cruisers and two battleships. At 01:46, three additional ships, escorts—one on either beam of the formation and one on the starboard quarter—became visible. &quot;Sealion&quot; had in fact intercepted a powerful surface fleet consisting of the battleships , , and , the cruiser , and the destroyers , , , , , and .

At 02:45, &quot;Sealion&quot;, ahead of the task force, turned in and slowed for the attack. Eleven minutes later, she fired six torpedoes at the second ship in line, &quot;Kongō&quot;. At 02:59, she fired three at &quot;Nagato&quot;. At 03:00, her crew saw and heard three hits from the first salvo, flooding two of &quot;Kongō&quot;″s boiler rooms and giving her a list to port. &quot;Nagato&quot;, alerted by the explosions, turned hard and the &quot;Sealion&quot;″s second salvo missed ahead, running on to hit and sink &quot;Urakaze&quot;; the destroyer&#x27;s magazines were hit by the torpedo. She blew up and sank quickly with the loss of all hands on board, including the commanding officer of DesDiv 17, Yokota Yasuteru.

&quot;Sealion&quot; opened to the westward. The Japanese searched to the east. By 03:10, the submarine had reloaded and began tracking again with the thought that the torpedoes had only dented the battleship&#x27;s armor belt. The Japanese formation, however, had begun zig-zagging and the sea and wind had increased. At 04:50, the enemy formation split into two groups. &quot;Sealion&quot; began tracking the slower group consisting of &quot;Kongō&quot;, &quot;Isokaze&quot; and &quot;Hamakaze&quot;, performing an end around to regain attack position. At 05:24, a tremendous explosion lit the area and &quot;Kongō&quot; disappeared.

It was customary in American submarines to mark a name on the head of each torpedo as it was loaded into the tube nest. They usually bore the names of the torpedo crews&#x27; wives or best girls. Some carried the names of the factory employee who had sold the most war bonds during a given period. That night, however, four of &quot;Sealion&quot;″s torpedoes, as they raced out of their tubes, carried the names Foster, O&#x27;Connell, Paul and Ogilvie—the men who had been killed in the bombing of &quot;Sealion I&quot; three years earlier. It was not customary for the crews of American submarines to make audio recordings of their attacks. However, the &quot;Sealion&quot; crew had obtained a sound recorder left behind by a CBS war correspondent who had debarked at Midway, and when ordered to battle stations after encountering the Japanese battle group, one sailor positioned the microphone by an intercom in the conning tower. That recording, along with a similar recording of an attack on a Japanese oiler during the &quot;Sealion&quot;″s fifth patrol, were then preserved by the Naval Underwater Sound Laboratory, and are thought to be the only surviving sound recordings of World War II submarine attacks.

===Subsequent activity===

During the next few days, &quot;Sealion&quot; continued to patrol between Mainland China and Formosa, and on 28 November, she headed for Guam.

On her fourth war patrol, from 14 December 1944 – 24 January 1945, &quot;Sealion&quot; returned to the South China Sea in a coordinated attack group with sister ships and . Poor weather plagued her, and of the 26 days spent on station, all but six were spent on the surface. On 20 December, she sighted a supply ship escorted by a destroyer through her high periscope, and at 19:37 fired six torpedoes at the supply ship for four hits. The submarine then evaded the escort, reloaded, and waited. Two and one-half hours later, &quot;Mamiya&quot; was still afloat, and the submarine went in for a second attack. At 00:32 on 21 December, she launched three torpedoes for two hits. The supply ship went under.

That day, &quot;Sealion&quot; joined the Seventh Fleet, and from 28 December 1944 to 14 January 1945, she performed reconnaissance duties in support of the reoccupation of the Philippine Islands. On the latter date, she cleared her patrol area and headed for Western Australia, arriving at Fremantle on 24 January. She departed Fremantle on her fifth war patrol on 19 February. Again operating in a coordinated attack group, she returned to the South China Sea, then proceeded into the Gulf of Siam. In the predawn darkness of 17 March, she torpedoed and sank &quot;Samui&quot;, and on 2 April, she rescued an Army aviator who had been drifting in a rubber raft for 23 days. That same day, three more downed aviators were transferred to her from , and on 6 April, she delivered her passengers to Subic Bay.

By 30 April, &quot;Sealion&quot; was again ready for sea. With and , she departed Subic Bay for the northern part of the South China Sea. Through May, she patrolled off Hong Kong and provided lifeguard services for strikes against Formosa. At the end of the month, she received downed aviators from and transported them back to Subic, then with passengers bound for Hawaii, she sailed east. On 12 June, she arrived at Guam, whence she proceeded to a lifeguard station off Wake Island, and on 30 June, she cleared that area for Pearl Harbor.

==Post-war==
From Pearl Harbor, &quot;Sealion&quot; continued on to San Francisco, California, where she was undergoing overhaul at the end of the war. With the cessation of hostilities, inactivation preparations were added to the overhaul, and on 2 February 1946, the submarine, which had been awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for her six war patrols, was decommissioned.

A year and one-half later, however, &quot;Sealion&quot;, along with , was designated for conversion to a troop carrier, and in April 1948, she entered the San Francisco Naval Shipyard for the eight-months conversion under project SCB 30. During that period, her torpedo tubes and forward engines were removed, and her forward engine room and forward and after torpedo rooms were converted to berth 123 troops. The forward engine room and after torpedo room were designed for alternative use as cargo space. The wardroom was redesigned for use as an operating room; the beam aft of the conning tower was extended, and a large watertight cylindrical chamber was installed abaft the conning tower to store amphibious landing equipment—including a tracked landing vehicle (LVT).

On 2 November 1948, &quot;Sealion&quot; was recommissioned a Submarine, Transport, with the hull classification symbol SSP-315. Training exercises off the southern California coast, with Marines embarked, took her into the spring of 1949 when she was ordered to the Atlantic for duty in SubDiv 21. During April, she operated in the New London, Connecticut, area, then, in May, she commenced operations out of Norfolk, Virginia, as a unit of Submarine Squadron 6 (SubRon 6), SubDiv 61. On 31 January 1950, she was reclassified a transport submarine with hull classification symbol ASSP-315; and, by the spring of that year, had conducted exercises as far north as Labrador and as far south as the southern Caribbean. From April to June 1950, she underwent her first post-conversion overhaul at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, and in July, she resumed operations out of Norfolk.

&quot;Sealion&quot; was reassigned to SubDiv 63 in March 1955 and tested helicopter operations in 1956. It was reclassified submarine transport APSS-315 on 24 October 1956, &quot;Sealion&quot; continued a schedule of exercises with Marines, Underwater Demolition Teams and Beach Jumper units and, on occasion, Army units, off the Virginia and Carolina coasts and in the Caribbean until 1960. During that time, interruptions came only for overhaul periods, during one of which the &quot;LVT hangar&quot; abaft the conning tower was removed, and for one deployment with the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean from August–November 1957.

On 30 June 1960, &quot;Sealion&quot; was decommissioned at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where she remained as a reserve training submarine until reactivated a year later. In August 1961, she was towed to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for overhaul; on 20 October, she was recommissioned, and on 18 December, she rejoined SubRon 6 at Norfolk. There, she resumed a schedule similar to that of the 1950s, interrupted by regular overhauls, and in the fall of 1962, to support the blockade put into effect during the Cuban Missile Crisis. On 22 October 1962, she departed Norfolk on what was to be a month-long training cruise in the Caribbean, but the formation of the blockade force altered the cruise plans. On 3 December, she returned to Norfolk and from then into 1967 she maintained her schedule of exercises with Marine Reconnaissance, Underwater Demolition Teams, and SEAL personnel. On 15 September 1967, she changed homeports and administrative control, and for the next two years, she operated out of Key West, Florida, as a unit of SubDiv 121. Reclassified an amphibious transport submarine with hull classification symbol LPSS-315 in January 1969, &quot;Sealion&quot; was ordered inactivated the following summer, and, in September, she proceeded to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where she was decommissioned and placed in the inactive fleet on 20 February 1970.

Stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 March 1977, &quot;Sealion&quot; was sunk as a target off Newport, Rhode Island, on 8 July 1978.

<text>The 1933 double eagle is a United States 20-dollar gold coin. Although 445,500 specimens of this Saint-Gaudens double eagle were minted in 1933 in the midst of the Great Depression, none were ever officially circulated; further, all but two were ordered to be melted down. However, 20 more are known to have been rescued from melting by being stolen and found their way into the hands of collectors before later being recovered. Nine of the recovered coins were destroyed, making this one of the world&#x27;s rarest coins, with only 13 known specimens remaining—only one of which is privately owned, which is known as the Weitzman Specimen. Because the coin was never released to the public, it is illegal to privately own any of the 1933 double eagles, with the exception of the Weitzman Specimen. The United States Secret Service is said to investigate reports of the existence of other specimens that come to light.

The two intentionally spared coins are in the U.S. National Numismatic Collection, ten others are held in the United States Bullion Depository at Fort Knox, and the one remaining recovered coin was sold in 2002 to private collector Stuart Weitzman (who remained anonymous at the time) for US$7.59 million (equivalent to $12.2 million as of 2022) —the second-highest price paid at auction for a single U.S. coin. The coin sold again to an anonymous buyer at auction in June 2021 for US$18.9 million, making it the most expensive coin ever sold.

== Production ==

In 1933, in an attempt to end the 1930s general bank crisis, U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 6102, which provisions included:

Congress additionally passed the Gold Reserve Act in 1934, which outlawed the circulation and private possession of United States gold coins for general circulation, with an exemption for collector coins. This act declared that gold coins were no longer legal tender in the United States, and people had to turn in their gold coins for other forms of currency. The 1933 gold double eagles were struck after this executive order, but because they were no longer legal tender, most of the 1933 gold coins were melted down in late 1934 and some were destroyed in tests. Two of the $20 double eagles were presented by the United States Mint to the U.S. National Numismatic Collection, and one is currently on display in the National Museum of American History, in The Value of Money exhibit.

These two coins should have been the only 1933 double eagle coins in existence. However, unknown to the mint, a number of the coins (20 have been recovered so far) were stolen, possibly by the U.S. Mint cashier, and found their way via Philadelphia jeweler Israel Switt into the hands of collectors. The coins circulated among collectors for several years before the Secret Service became aware of their existence. The matter came to the attention of mint officials when an investigative reporter looked into the history of the coins he had spotted in an upcoming Stack&#x27;s Bowers coin auction and contacted the Mint as part of his research. As a result, an official investigation into the matter was launched by the Secret Service in March 1944. Prior to the investigation, a Texas dealer sold one of the coins to a foreign buyer, and it left the U.S. on February 29, 1944.

During the first year of the investigation, seven coins were seized or voluntarily turned in to the Secret Service and were subsequently destroyed at the Mint; an eighth coin was recovered the following year and met the same fate. In 1945, the investigation identified the alleged thief and his accomplice, Switt, who admitted to selling the nine (located) coins, but said he could not recall how he obtained them. The Justice Department tried to prosecute them, but the statute of limitations had passed. A ninth coin was recovered and destroyed in 1952.

In contrast, the 1933 Eagle was issued before Roosevelt&#x27;s withdrawal order, so they may be legally owned by private citizens. However, it is estimated that no more than 40 exist, the rest having been melted, making them exceptionally rare.

== Farouk Specimen ==

===1944 Export and subsequent disappearance===

The missing double eagle was acquired by King Farouk of Egypt, who was a voracious collector of many things, including imperial Fabergé eggs, antique aspirin bottles, paperweights, postage stamps—and coins, of which he had a collection of over 8,500. In 1944 Farouk purchased a 1933 double eagle, and in strict adherence with the law, his ministers applied to the United States Treasury Department for an export license for the coin. Mistakenly, just days before the mint theft was discovered, the license was granted. The Treasury Department attempted to work through diplomatic channels to request the return of the coin from Egypt, but World War II delayed their efforts for several years. In 1952, King Farouk was deposed in a coup d&#x27;etat, and many of his possessions were made available for public auction (run by Stacks Bowers) – including the double eagle coin. The United States government requested the return of the coin, and the Egyptian government stated that it would comply with the request. However, the coin disappeared and was not seen again in Egypt.

===1996 Reappearance===

In 1996, a double eagle surfaced again after over 40 years of obscurity, when British coin dealer Stephen Fenton was arrested by U.S. Secret Service agents during a sting operation at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York. Although he initially told investigators he bought the coin over the counter at his shop, he later changed his story. Under sworn testimony, he insisted the double eagle had come from the collection of King Farouk, though this could not be verified. Criminal charges against Fenton were subsequently dropped, and he defended his ownership of the coin in civil court. The civil case was settled in 2001 when it was agreed that ownership of the double eagle would revert to the United States government, and the coin could then legally be sold at auction to the highest-bidding private owner. The United States Treasury issued a unique document to &quot;issue and monetize&quot; the coin, thereby making it a legal-tender gold coin in the United States.

When the coin was seized, it was transferred to a holding place believed to be safe: the treasury vaults of the World Trade Center. When the court settlement was reached in July 2001, only two months before the Trade Center was destroyed, the coin was transferred to Fort Knox for safekeeping.

===2002 sale===

On July 30, 2002, the 1933 double eagle was sold to an anonymous bidder at a Stacks Bowers auction held in New York for $6.6 million, plus a 15-percent buyer&#x27;s premium, and an additional $20 needed to &quot;monetize&quot; the face value of the coin so it would become legal currency. This brought the final sale price to $7,590,020.00, almost twice the previous record for a coin. Half the bid price was to be delivered to the United States Treasury, plus the $20 to monetize the coin, while Stephen Fenton was entitled to the other half. The auction took less than nine minutes.

===2021 sale===

The 2002 buyer remained anonymous for nearly two decades, until March 2021, when it was revealed in a &quot;New York Times&quot; article to be collector Stuart Weitzman. Weitzman&#x27;s decision to reveal himself as the coin&#x27;s owner since 2002 coincided with his decision to sell it, in a Sotheby&#x27;s auction scheduled for June 2021. The coin was cataloged as Lot 1 in Sotheby&#x27;s June 8, 2021 auction, and sold that day for $18,872,250.

== Discovery of ten more coins ==
In August 2005, the United States Mint announced the recovery of ten additional stolen 1933 double eagle gold coins from the family of Philadelphia jeweler Israel Switt, the illicit coin dealer identified by the Secret Service as a party to the theft who admitted selling the first nine double eagles recovered a half-century earlier. In September 2004, the coins&#x27; ostensible owner, Joan Switt Langbord, voluntarily surrendered the 10 coins to the Secret Service. In July 2005, the coins were authenticated by the United States Mint after working with the Smithsonian Institution, as being genuine 1933 double eagles.

According to various accounts, Israel Switt had many contacts and friends within the Philadelphia Mint, and reportedly had access to many points of the minting process. A secondary source reports that the Secret Service found that only one man, George McCann, had access to the coins at the time and served prison time for similar embezzlement in 1940. Switt may have obtained the stolen 1933 double eagles through a relationship with the head mint cashier. One theory is that McCann swapped previous year double eagles for the 1933 specimens prior to melting, thus avoiding compromise of accounting books and inventory lists.

Coin experts in the numismatic world have advanced an argument that Switt could have legally obtained the 1933 coins when he was exchanging gold bullion for coins. Although the Mint records clearly show that no 1933 double eagles were issued, there were allegedly three weeks in March 1933 when new double eagles could possibly have been legally obtained. The mint began striking double eagles on March 15, and Roosevelt&#x27;s executive order to ban them was not finalized until April 5. On March 6, 1933, the Secretary of the Treasury ordered the Director of the Mint to pay gold only under license issued by the Secretary, and the United States Mint cashier&#x27;s daily statements do not reflect that any 1933 double eagles were paid out.

Until the early 1970s (when President Nixon took the United States off of the gold standard and President Ford signed legislation that again made it legal for the public to own gold bullion), any recovered 1933 double eagle, as gold bullion, was required to be melted. Therefore, while double eagles recovered prior to 1974 were melted down, any double eagle recovered now can be spared this fate. Currently, with the exception of the one sold on July 30, 2002, 1933 double eagle coins cannot be the legal possession of any member of the public, as they were never issued and hence remain the property of the United States government.

On October 28, 2010, United States District Court judge Legrome D. Davis released a 20-page decision regarding claims to the coins by descendants of Israel Switt, leading to a trial in July 2011. On July 20, 2011, after a ten-day trial, a jury ruled unanimously in favor of the United States government concerning ownership of the ten additional double eagles. The court concluded that circumstantial evidence proved that Israel Switt had illegally obtained the coins from the United States government and that they are thus still government property. The decision was affirmed on August 29, 2012, and the plaintiffs planned to appeal.

The ten double eagles were stored at the Fort Knox Bullion Depository. They were shown to jurors in Philadelphia during the July 2011 trial, and were then returned to Fort Knox, where they were to remain until a decision was made regarding their disposition. In April 2015, a United States federal appeals court ordered the coins returned to the Langbord family because the original asset seizure was conducted improperly, as the government failed to file a judicial civil forfeiture complaint within 90 days of the family&#x27;s seized asset claim. This order was reversed on July 28, 2015, and in October 2015, an &quot;en banc&quot; session was held with 13 judges from the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, where they heard oral arguments in the ongoing appeal. On August 1, 2016, the judges reversed the previous ruling, finding the coins to be property of the United States government. The Langbords appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which on April 17, 2017 denied &quot;certiorari&quot;.

The 1933 double eagles were viewed by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on their August 21, 2017 visit to the United States Bullion Depository at Fort Knox. The Freedom of Information Act document released after their visit references the coins as &quot;ten (10) &#x27;1933 Double Eagle&#x27; gold coins recently returned to the custody of the Mint.&quot;

<doc id="412408" wikidata="Q1962909" url="?curid=412408" title="Minsk family of computers">
<text>Minsk was a family of mainframe computers that were developed and produced in the Byelorussian SSR from 1959 to 1975.

==Models==
The MINSK-1 was a vacuum-tube digital computer that went into production in 1960.

The MINSK-2 was a solid-state digital computer that went into production in 1962.

The MINSK-22 was a modified version of Minsk-2 that went into production in 1965.

The MINSK-23 went into production in 1966.

The most advanced model was &quot;Minsk-32&quot;, developed in 1968. It supported COBOL, FORTRAN and ALGAMS (a version of ALGOL). This and earlier versions also used a machine-oriented language called &quot;AKI&quot; (&quot;AvtoKod &quot;Inzhener&quot;&quot;, i.e., &quot;Engineer&#x27;s Autocode&quot;). It stood somewhere between the native assembly language &quot;SSK&quot; (&quot;Sistema Simvolicheskogo Kodirovaniya&quot;, or &quot;System of symbolic coding&quot;) and higher-level languages, like FORTRAN.

The word size was 31 bits for Minsk-1 and 37 bits for the other models.

At one point the Minsk-222 (an upgraded prototype based on the most popular model, Minsk-22) and Minsk-32 were considered as a potential base for a future unified line of mutually compatible mainframes — that would later become the ES EVM line, but despite being popular among users, good match between their tech and Soviet tech base and familiarity to both programmers and technicians lost to the proposal to copy the IBM/360 line of mainframes — the possibility to just copy all the software existing for it was deemed more important.

<text>Domhnall II, Earl of Mar (date of birth unknown but prior to 130511 August 1332) was briefly Regent of Scotland during the minority of David II, King of Scotland.

Domhnall&#x27;s father was Gartnait, Earl of Mar. His mother&#x27;s identity is uncertain, although she seems to have been an elder daughter of Robert Bruce, Earl of Carrick.

He was taken prisoner by the English in 1306 while so young he was referred to as an &#x27;infant&#x27; in the royal orders to keep him prisoner, however, because of his tender age was treated very gently and eventually became part of the household of Bishop of Bristol. He remained a prisoner until after the Battle of Bannockburn when he was released with the other Scottish prisoners but chose to remain in England. In 1322 he fought with the English against the Scots at the Battle of Old Byland. 

It appears likely that he fought on the side of Edward II of England at the Battle of Boroughbridge in March 1322, as it is recorded that afterwards the Earl of Mar took Bartholomew de Badlesmere, who was one of Edward&#x27;s captured opponents, to Canterbury.

He went over to the Scottish side after Edward II was deposed and led one of the three Scottish divisions at the Battle of Stanhope Park.

In 1332 the regent of Scotland, Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray, died. On 2 August Domhnall was elected as the new regent at a meeting of the Scottish nobles at Perth.
Following the invasion of Edward Balliol, with the support of Edward III of England, Mar led the Scots loyalists to confront them. He was defeated and killed at the Battle of Dupplin Moor, only nine days after his election as regent.

Through his marriage to Isabella Stewart, daughter of Sir Alexander Stewart of Bonkyll and Jean Fitz James, they had a son, Thomas of Mar, and a single daughter, Margaret of Mar, who succeeded her brother and became, in her turn, Countess of Mar.

<doc id="412413" wikidata="Q1678813" url="?curid=412413" title="Jake Beckley">
<text>Jacob Peter Beckley (August 4, 1867 – June 25, 1918), nicknamed &quot;Eagle Eye&quot;, was an American professional baseball first baseman. He played in Major League Baseball for the Pittsburgh Alleghenys, Pittsburgh Burghers, Pittsburgh Pirates, New York Giants, Cincinnati Reds and St. Louis Cardinals from 1888 to 1907.

Beckley had a batting average of over .300 in 13 seasons. His 244 triples are fourth all time and his 23,767 putouts is a major league record. A career .308 hitter he was elected into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1971 via the Veterans Committee.

==Early life==
Beckley was born in Hannibal, Missouri. He was the son of Bernhart and Rosina (Neth) Beckley. Beckley began playing semi-professional baseball while still a teenager. A former Hannibal teammate, Bob Hart, suggested the 18-year-old Beckley to the Leavenworth Oilers (Leavenworth, Kansas) of the Western Association. After splitting two seasons between Leavenworth and a team in Lincoln, Nebraska, Beckley&#x27;s contract was sold to the St. Louis Whites in the Western Association before he was purchased (along with Harry Staley) by the Pittsburgh Alleghenys for $4,500 midway through the 1888 season.

==Major league career==
After playing one and a half seasons for the Alleghenys, Beckley and eight of his teammates jumped to the Pittsburgh Burghers, a team in the newly-formed Players&#x27; League (PL). Manager Ned Hanlon crossed over, as well. Beckley stated he was willing to go to the PL because &quot;I&#x27;m only in this game for the money anyway.&quot; The league lasted only one season, and Beckley spent the next five and a half seasons with the Pittsburgh Pirates.

On July 25, 1896, Beckley was traded to the New York Giants for Harry Davis and $1,000. Beckley was released by the Giants the following season on May 22, and signed as a free agent with the Cincinnati Reds five days later. In his first season with the Reds, Beckley was unsuccessful in getting rookie Honus Wagner out with the hidden ball trick, a tactic he had been known to use against the opposition. But later when Wagner&#x27;s Louisville Colonels came to play at Cincinnati, Beckley was successful in getting Wagner out, employing a strategy that involved the use of two baseballs. Against the St. Louis Browns (since 1900, the St. Louis Cardinals), Beckley belted three home runs in the same game on September 26, 1897, a feat not again matched until 1922 by Ken Williams. He played with Cincinnati for seven seasons and was later purchased by the Cardinals on February 11, 1904.

Beckley retired after the 1907 season with 2,930 career hits, second only to Cap Anson. He continues to rank fourth all-time among major leaguers in triples with 244. As of the 2014 season, Beckley holds the all-time best batting average among Pirates first basemen (.300). Beckley holds the MLB record for career putouts, with 23,743, and ranks second all-time in games played at first base, with 2,376.

==Later life==

After his MLB career ended, Beckley became a player/manager for Kansas City in the American Association in 1908–1909, Bartlesville in the Western Association in 1910, and Hannibal in the Central Association in 1911. He served as an umpire in the Federal League in 1913 and also served as a baseball coach at William Jewell College in Liberty, Missouri. In addition to his umpiring and coaching after retirement from professional play, Beckley operated a grain business in Kansas City.

Beckley married Molly Murphy of Hannibal in 1891, but she died of tuberculosis seven months after their wedding. He later remarried after his playing career concluded. Beckley died of heart disease in Kansas City, Missouri at the age of 50. He was interred at the Riverside Cemetery in Hannibal.

==Honors==
* Elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1971.
* Member of Pittsburgh Pirates Hall of Fame
* Elected into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 2014.
* In 2016, the Hannibal Cavemen of the Prospect League installed the Jake Beckley .308 Gate at Clemens Field in Hannibal, Missouri, Beckley&#x27;s hometown and burial site.

<doc id="412419" wikidata="Q2405949" url="?curid=412419" title="Captain Britain">
<text>Captain Britain is a title used by various superheroes in comic books published by Marvel Comics, commonly in association with Excalibur. The moniker was first used in publication by [[Brian Braddock]] in &quot;Captain Britain&quot; #1 by writer Chris Claremont and artist Herb Trimpe, and is currently held by Brian&#x27;s twin sister, [[Betsy Braddock]].

The designation of the publisher&#x27;s primary continuity as Earth-616 originated in Dave Thorpe, Alan Davis and Alan Moore&#x27;s Marvel UK &quot;Captain Britain&quot; stories. The strip also established the multiversal Captain Britain Corps, members of which act as the champions of their own respective versions of the British Isles, which act as a nexus point between dimensions via Otherworld.

==Creation==
Marvel UK, the British wing of Marvel Comics, had been established in 1972. In order to fit in with the style of British weeklies, titles such as &quot;The Mighty World of Marvel&quot; consisted of reprinted Marvel material in an anthology magazine format, with much of the colour removed. However, these failed to make a major impression on the market, which was dominated by titles of original British material from Fleetway Publications and DC Thomson. In response, Marvel decided the line needed a British character as a flagship title. As Marvel UK itself was effectively a packaging operation at the time with no experienced creative staff the character was devised at Marvel&#x27;s American headquarters. London-born Chris Claremont - at the time a rising star in the company following his successful work on the revival of &quot;X-Men&quot; - was one of the few Anglophiles on staff, and was assigned to the title. He came up with the name, origin and cast for the new title, &quot;Captain Britain&quot;. Art duties went to experienced &quot;Incredible Hulk&quot; artist Herb Trimpe, who lived in Cornwall at the time and would recall the 8-page strips typically only took him a couple of days to draw. The designer of the character&#x27;s patriotic costume, complete with Heraldic lion rampant, is unknown; Trimpe has speculated it was John Romita.

==Publishing history==
===British comics===

The &quot;Captain Britain&quot; title launched with some fanfare, even garnering reviews (albeit negative ones) in &quot;The Financial Times&quot; and &quot;The Daily Record&quot;. &quot;Captain Britain&quot; #8 would introduce Brian&#x27;s twin sister, model Elizabeth &quot;Betsy&quot; Braddock, who was revealed to have psychic powers, with the following issue debuting Jamie Braddock, their playboy racing-car-driving older brother. However, Claremont left the title after the tenth issue. His replacement was Gary Friedrich, best known for his role in the creation of &quot;Ghost Rider&quot;. Sales were moribund, and &quot;Captain Britain&quot; went to black-and-white from #24 to cut costs, attempting to soften the blow with another free gift - Captain Britain&#x27;s lesser-spotted &#x27;Superjet&#x27;. Alan Davis would also recall that - unknown to the American creative team - the &#x27;lion mark&#x27; had previously been used by the Egg Marketing Board to denote the quality of eggs, leading to many jokes at the character&#x27;s expense (which is likely a bit of nonsense on Davis&#x27; part, as the lion on the eggs was an Heraldic &quot;lion passant&quot; (on three legs with a front paw raised) while that on the chest of Captain Britain is a &quot;lion rampant&quot; (rearing on the hind legs and pawing the air). In a 1986 article for &quot;Amazing Heroes&quot;, N.A. Collins named Captain Britain&#x27;s first costume among the six worst male superhero looks in comic history up to that point, noting the &quot;weird sunroof mask&quot; and the &quot;tacky Avon jewellery&quot;.
After 39 issues &quot;Captain Britain&quot; was merged with Marvel UK&#x27;s Spider-Man reprint title, at the time called &quot;Super Spider-Man&quot;. Meanwhile, Captain Britain had already appeared alongside Spider-Man in America. Claremont was working on &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; with John Byrne and decided to use the format as an introduction for Braddock via the device of him briefly rooming with Peter Parker. The two-issue storyline also saw the debut of Arcade and his Murderworld. The character had been a conclusive failure for Marvel. As a result, they realised that they needed to recruit from the British comic scene, and in August 1978 Stan Lee headhunted Dez Skinn. In what the specialist press called &quot;the Marvel Revolution&quot;, Skinn insisted on funds being made available to make homegrown material. Among his efforts was &quot;Hulk Comic&quot;, a weekly styled like Marvel UK&#x27;s rivals boys&#x27; comics. The title mixed reprints with new material, including a fantasy strip starring the Black Knight. The serial was written by Steve Parkhouse, who was deeply interested in Celtic and Arthurian myths, also drawing on the works of Ursula K. Le Guin, Larry Niven and J. R. R. Tolkien. This gave a perfect opportunity to reintroduce Captain Britain, now under a British-based creative team, with veteran John Stokes on art duties, later joined by Paul Neary.

Skinn quit Marvel UK, with Neary taking over as the offshoot&#x27;s editor-in-chief. Neary paused commissioning covers to free up resources to make a new &quot;Captain Britain&quot; feature for flagship anthology &quot;Marvel Superheroes&quot;. Even then he was only able to hire newcomers and turned to editor Dave Thorpe, who had never written before, and Alan Davis, an acquaintance of Neary&#x27;s who had only recently turned professional. Thorpe and Neary had already devised the idea of sending the character to a parallel Earth when Davis came on board. Davis was tasked with redesigning the lead character&#x27;s costume with the stipulation to lose the clumsy sceptre, with the artist taking a cues from military uniforms in the new look and bulk out his physique. His unused concepts for the character would later be used for some of the Captain Britain Corps. The new team debuted in &quot;Marvel Super-Heroes&quot; #377, in September 1981; it had initially been advertised as appearing in #375, but was hit by delays.

Thorpe would fall out with Davis and Marvel after only a few months when he wrote a story featuring Captain Britain resolving the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Neary backed the artist, leading to Thorpe leaving the strip. His replacement was Alan Moore . The new team moved the strip in a darker tone, reconfiguring Jaspers as a powerful reality-warping mutant and introducing the unstoppable hero-killing cybiote The Fury. Jackdaw was killed off, and in &quot;Marvel Super-Heroes&quot; #388 Captain Britain seemed to join him. This allowed the strip to cover the character&#x27;s resurrection and history in a new title, &quot;The Daredevils&quot;, in January 1983. Despite both the new title and the ongoing strip receiving good notices, including an Eagle Award, &quot;The Daredevils&quot; was a sales disappointment and was cancelled after 11 issues in November 1983, with Captain Britain transferring back to the relaunched &quot;Mighty World of Marvel&quot;. Following the conclusion of the &quot;Jaspers&#x27; Warp&quot; storyline in June 1984, Moore left the series. Meanwhile, the character was also selected for a sizeable role in &quot;Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions&quot;, a crossover limited series published by Marvel UK&#x27;s parent company. However, delays saw the title - originally created as to tie in with the 1980 Summer Olympics - held back until 1982.

Davis would briefly take over writing the story himself until being joined by Jamie Delano, an up-and-coming writer recommended by Moore, and Meggan was incorporated as a major supporting character. In January 1985 the serial was transferred back to a new &quot;Captain Britain&quot; monthly series. Sales were initially respectable but began to fall, while Davis felt Delano wasn&#x27;t interested in the superhero genre and was also finding his own time to be taken up by a lucrative role as artist for Captain Britain meanwhile would appear as a guest character in &quot;Captain America&quot; #305-306, with art from Neary.

===&quot;Excalibur&quot; (1987-1998)===

When Claremont read the reinvigorated &quot;Captain Britain&quot; stories he was impressed with the development of the characters The result was Claremont and Davis creating the super-team Excalibur, picking up Captain Britain and Meggan from where &quot;Captain Britain&quot; had left them and adding X-Men refugees Nightcrawler, Shadowcat and the Rachel Summers incarnation of Phoenix. The group initially came together in the lavish &quot;Excalibur Special Edition&quot; in 1987, and soon became the stars of a regular series, with Captain Britain playing a major role. The success also led to Marvel printing a trade paperback compiling the material Davis had produced for the character after Moore&#x27;s departure, which was coloured by several artists. Davis would redesign the character&#x27;s costume again for &quot;Excalibur&quot; #13; previously it had largely been depicted in black-and-white, with Davis himself colouring the colour cover appearances. However, he found the American colourists were frequently making mistakes and so simplified it. Parallel to these storylines the character also appeared in new British material, featuring as a supporting character in Marvel UK&#x27;s &quot;Knights of Pendragon&quot; series.

Captain Britain was lost in the time-steam off-panel before &quot;Excalibur&quot; #68, and when he did return was rechristened Britannic, with a redesigned costume. Warren Ellis became writer for the title in 1994, and one of his storylines involved revitalising Brian, who reclaimed the identity and costume of Captain Britain in &quot;Excalibur&quot; #100. However, Ellis would leave the series soon afterwards and his successor Ben Raab swiftly wrote the character. Sales were falling and the title was cancelled in 1998, ending with Brian returning to marry Meggan. Captain Britain then spent several years without a regular title, though in 2001 Raab wrote the four-issue &quot;Excalibur&quot; limited series that involved the Captain Britain Corps and ended with Braddock as King of Otherworld.

===&quot;New Excalibur&quot;, &quot;Captain Britain and MI: 13&quot; and &quot;Secret Avengers&quot;===
Brian was later featured as the team leader of &quot;New Excalibur&quot; in 2005, culminating with the &quot;X-Men: Die by the Sword&quot; limited series. Following the Secret Invasion crossover, Brian headlined the 2008 series &quot;Captain Britain and MI: 13&quot;, written by Paul Cornell, which included some characters from &quot;New Excalibur&quot;, as well as members of MI: 13 who appeared in Cornell&#x27;s &quot;Wisdom&quot; limited series. The character later appeared as a regular character in the 2010-2013 &quot;Secret Avengers&quot; series, from issue #22 (April 2012) through its final issue #37 (March 2013), reappearing with the Avengers as a part of the &quot;Time Runs Out&quot; storyline.

Around the same time the character made his first appearance in a British-made comic since the end of &quot;Knights of Pendragon&quot; when Panini Comics, who had taken over Marvel UK following the latter&#x27;s mid-1990s collapse following an ill-advised rapid expansion under Neary, began producing small indigenous strips for the young reader-orientated &quot;Spectacular Spider-Man&quot;. Captain Britain guest-starred in #114, dated March 2005, and written by Jim Alexander with art by John Haward and a returning Stokes. Positive reader response saw a second appearance the following year in &quot;Spectacular Spider-Man&quot; #133.

===Dawn of X and Beyond===
During the 2019 X-Men franchise relaunch Dawn of X, following Brian&#x27;s corruption by Morgan le Fey, Betsy Braddock claimed the mantle of Captain Britain in a new volume of &quot;Excalibur&quot; written by Tini Howard. Leading a new Excalibur roster including Gambit, Rogue, Jubilee, Rictor and Apocalypse, the team comes into conflict with Morgan le Fey and the anti-mutant Coven Akkaba, as well as Saturnyne, who had usurped the role of omniversal magisitrix and refuses to accept Betsy as Captain Britain. During &quot;X of Swords&quot;, in which Apocalypse&#x27;s secret plans of reuniting Krakoa with Arakko come to fruition, leading Saturnyne to arrange a tournament between both sides to avoid a war in Otherworld, Betsy is apparently killed in a duel with Isca the Unbeaten, shattering along with the Starlight Sword. Saturnyne reconstitutes the shards to revive the Captain Britain Corps, but is distraught when the new Captains Britain are variants of Betsy rather than of Brian. After the tournament, Betsy&#x27;s consciousness becomes lost in the multiverse, returning with the assistance of Kwannon, during which the two begin to come to peace with their complicated relationship. After the revival of Morgan le Fey, Betsy leads Excalibur against Merlyn and King Arthur. As Avalon falls to Merlyn and Arthur, the mutants escape to Earth, severing the connection to Otherworld, while uses the Starlight Sword to return to the fight herself, knowing she will be trapped without the protection of Krakoan resurrection.

In the follow-up series &quot;Knights of X&quot;, also written by Howard, Betsy and the Corps take up refuge with Merlyn&#x27;s daughter and former magistrix Roma, rescuing mutants facing danger in Otherworld. Refusing Betsy&#x27;s request for an army, Roma instead sends her on a quest for the Siege Perilous alongside Gambit, Rachel Summers, Bei the Blood Moon, Gloriana, Kylun, Rictor, Shatterstar, Shogo Lee, and Arthur&#x27;s mutant son Mordred. After being tested by the Siege Perilous, Betsy and her knights forge a pathway to Krakoa, bringing an army of Krakoan mutants to fight against Merlyn and Arthur, with Betsy finally executing Merlyn and decreeing that the Corps will not be bound by any one ruler and will instead defend the multiverse on their own terms. During this ordeal, Betsy also cemented her romantic relationship with Rachel Summers, sharing a kiss as Rachel helps the knights overcome the Siege Perilious.

Throughout the Dawn of X and subsequent stories, Betsy had been contending with an increasingly-fraught political situation at home, with forces within the British government and populace opposing the legitimacy of a mutant holding the role of their champion. This conflict worsens in Howard&#x27;s series &quot;Captain Britain: Betsy Braddock&quot;, which features Betsy&#x27;s further conflicts with Morgan le Fey as the villain attempts to conquer Britain with the assistance of Doctor Doom. Betsy is assisted in this series by Rachel, Brian, and Meggan (now going by the monikers of Askani, Captain Avalon, and Gloriana, respectively), as well as revived members of Pete Wisdom and the S.T.R.I.K.E. PSI Division, together defeating le Fey by forging a true respectful connection between le Fey and the land. As Brian reconstitutes the Braddock Academy, Betsy continues on with her responsibilities to Britain and the multiverse as Captain Britain and leader of the Corps.

==Fictional character biography==
In the main continuity of Marvel Comics, three characters have used the Captain Britain title in regular publication.

===Brian Braddock===
===Betsy Braddock===
===Kelsey Leigh Kirkland===
===Other===
Modred the Mystic briefly assumed the mantle of Captain Britain by syphoning off Braddock&#x27;s energies in an effort to defeat Merlyn.

===Captain Britain Corps===
====Publication history====
The Captain Britain Corps is a fictional league of super-heroes appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The characters are all known as, or appear as an alternative version of, Captain Britain, each coming from an alternative reality. Created by writer Alan Moore and artist Alan Davis, the corps first appeared in &quot;The Daredevils&quot; #6 (June 1983). Founded by Merlyn, his daughter Roma and Sir James Braddock, the organization is tasked with defending the multiverse. The power wielded by members of the corps is derived from absorbing and metabolizing energy generated by the matrix of &quot;exotic particles&quot; naturally occurring at weak points between dimensions, which are present at each dimension&#x27;s equivalent of the British Isles in unusual quantity and proximity; members are tasked with safeguarding the gateways between dimensions and being the highest champion of each earth&#x27;s respective morality codes. In addition to the Captains themselves, the organization has included administrators such as Merlyn, Roma, and Saturnyne.

====Fictional organisation biography====
Merlyn and Roma had arranged for each chosen member of the Corps to gain superpowers, often using unscrupulous means. Following Merlyn&#x27;s funeral, Roma took control over the corps, making Saturnyne her subordinate and bringing Corps members to the Starlight Citadel for training. Roma also tasked Corps members to take turns in defending Otherworld. Corps members would continue to gather in for important occasions. The corps rarely fought as a unit in these stories, with an exception occurring when Roma dispatched them against Franklin Richards and the Fantastic Four.

The Corps was nearly wiped out by Mastermind, a villainous computer belonging to Brian Braddock, and a group of mutated children known as the Warpies, who were once the wards of Captain UK. Roma stepped down as omniversal guardian, giving the title to Brian Braddock, who became King of Otherworld and rebuilt the Corps. Another wave of destruction tore through Otherworld due to Wanda Maximoff&#x27;s alterations to reality in &quot;House of M&quot;, which nearly led to Roma and Saturnyne erasing that universe. It once again it came under attack, this time from Mad Jim Jaspers and Corps members which he began to turn into Furys. The end of the battle saw Roma dead, along with most of the Corps along with her. Saturnyne appointed Albion the new leader as they rebuilt the corps once again. Later, the Captain Britain Corps investigate universal Incursions which are causing the destruction of various realities, and the deaths of twenty Corpsmen. After the members of the Corps capture a Mapmaker, the Ivory Kings send their entire forces to overrun the Starlight Citadel, destroying the entire Corps. Saturnyne is able to teleport Brian Braddock to safety, leaving him as the Corps&#x27; only survivor.
====Membership====
The Captain Britain Corps spans the multiverse; the exact number of members is unclear. Many members are simply named Captain Britain, while some others use names such as Captain U.K. or Lady London or names reflective of the specific characteristics of their respective universes (such as Hauptmann Englande or The Violet Swan) or individual circumstances (such as Spider-UK). Of the corps members depicted in publication, most, but not all, have been alternate versions of Brian or Betsy Braddock.

====Known members====
A number of individuals are known in-story to have been members of the Captain Britain Corps at some point in their fictional portrayals.

==Other versions==
===Marvel 2099===
In the unified Marvel 2099 reality of Earth-2099, an unidentified Captain Britain appears as a member of the 2099 version of the New Avengers.

===Ultimate Universe===
In the pages of &quot;Ultimate Invasion&quot;, Maker traveled to Earth-6160 and remade it into his own image. A French nobleman named Henri Duggary is this world&#x27;s Captain Britain, ruling over the European Coalition and being one of the members of the Maker&#x27;s Council. It&#x27;s implied he took the mantle by force and is keen on suppressing Britain&#x27;s culture and its symbols. After the Maker was locked into The City with Iron Man and Kang the Conqueror, Duggary meets with the other members of the Council and suggests that they should divide the North American Union among themselves, redistributing it.

When Iron Lad leads Doom, Thor, and Sif to Latveria to raid the Maker&#x27;s repository, he attacks them, wounding Thor with a magic blade before being hit in the left eye by Iron Lad. Henri informs the rest of Council, bitter as the brawl disfigured his face. He gets some sympathy from Hulk as the group takes advantage of the situation, making use of a Stark/Stane satellite to attack Stark Tower in a false flag attack, causing thousands of casualties.

Months later, Henri Duggary is in charge of the East Coast and meets with the appointed Shadow Governor of New York, 
Wilson Fisk, who informs him about Spider-Man and Green Goblin. Henri advises Fisk to use the resources that they gave him. When interrogated by Green Goblin, Bullseye states to him that the loyalty that he and his siblings share was enough that they tore out one of their eyes the day when Henri&#x27;s eye was wounded.

At the time when the Ultimates confront exterminators Hank Pym and Janet van Dyne, Henri Duggary attacks with his Black Crusade and an army of Giants. Wasp accepts her gifts and helps to fight Duggary&#x27;s forces. After some convincing from Captain America, Hank Pym becomes Giant-Man and grows large enough to step on Dugarry&#x27;s soldiers. Since Duggary&#x27;s body was nowhere to be found among the corpses, the Ultimates assumed that he got away, leaving his whereabouts unknown.

Later, Duggary meets with Wilson Fisk at a secure building, being briefed on Bullseye&#x27;s disappearance as Fisk mentions that he never met the Maker. He admits Fisk was right about the vigilante problem and seems convinced that it has grown into a larger threat to the Maker&#x27;s Council and their system since his defeat in the hands of the Ultimates. He offers Fisk a team of his agents, but Fisk refuses, stating he has six alternative plans.

<doc id="412425" wikidata="Q1435124" url="?curid=412425" title="Capital punishment in the United States">
<text>In the United States, capital punishment (also known as the death penalty) is a legal penalty in 27 states (of whom two, Oregon and Wyoming, do not currently hold death row inmates in jail), throughout the country at the federal level, and in American Samoa. It is also a legal penalty for some military offenses. Capital punishment has been abolished in the other 23 states and in the federal capital, Washington, D.C. It is usually applied for only the most serious crimes, such as aggravated murder. Although it is a legal penalty in 27 states, 20 of them have authority to execute death sentences, with the other 7, as well as the federal government and military, subject to moratoriums.

As of 2025, of the 38 OECD member countries, three (the United States, Japan and South Korea) retain the death penalty. South Korea has observed an unofficial moratorium on executions since 1997. Taiwan is the only other advanced democracy with capital punishment.

The existence of capital punishment in the United States can be traced to early colonial Virginia. There were no executions in the United States between 1967 and 1977. In 1972, the Supreme Court of the United States struck down capital punishment statutes in &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot;, reducing all pending death sentences to life imprisonment at the time. Subsequently, a majority of states enacted new death penalty statutes, and the court affirmed the legality of the practice in the 1976 case &quot;Gregg v. Georgia&quot;. Since then, more than 8,500 defendants have been sentenced to death; of these, more than 1,605 have been executed. Most executions are carried out by states. For every 8.2 people executed, one person on death row has been exonerated, in the modern era. At least 200 people who were sentenced to death since 1973 have been exonerated. That would be about 2.2% or one in 46.

In 2019, the Trump administration&#x27;s Department of Justice announced its plans to resume executions for federal crimes. On July 14, 2020, Daniel Lewis Lee became the first inmate executed by the federal government since 2003. Thirteen federal death row inmates were executed, all under Trump. The last and most recent federal execution was of Dustin Higgs, who was executed on January 16, 2021. On July 1, 2021, Attorney General Merrick Garland imposed a moratorium on federal executions. In April 2022, 2,414 people were on federal or state death row.

On December 23, 2024, President Joe Biden commuted the sentences of 37 of the 40 individuals on federal civilian death row to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole; 3 people remain on federal death row. Pursuant to Executive Order 14164, signed by Donald Trump on January 20, 2025, the first day of his second term, Attorney General Pam Bondi issued a memorandum on February 5, 2025 that rescinded the Garland moratorium on federal executions. The memorandum also directed the Justice Department to strengthen the death penalty and seek its application by prosecutors whenever reasonable.

== History ==
=== Pre-&quot;Furman&quot; history ===
The first recorded death sentence in the British North American colonies was carried out in 1608 on Captain George Kendall, who was executed by firing squad at the Jamestown colony for spying on behalf of the Spanish government. Executions in colonial America were also carried out by hanging. The hangman&#x27;s noose was one of the various punishments the Puritans of the Massachusetts Bay Colony applied to enforce religious and intellectual conformity on the whole community.

The Bill of Rights adopted in 1789 included the Eighth Amendment which prohibited cruel and unusual punishment. The Fifth Amendment was drafted with language implying a possible use of the death penalty, requiring a grand jury indictment for &quot;capital crime&quot; and a due process of law for deprivation of &quot;life&quot; by the government. The Fourteenth Amendment adopted in 1868 also requires a due process of law for deprivation of life by any states. The federal death penalty was restricted to a small category of crimes. Founders saw the ultimate penalty as a means of protecting sovereign interests. Death penalty was carried out according to local customs.

The &quot;Espy file&quot;, compiled by M. Watt Espy and John Ortiz Smykla, lists 15,269 people executed in the United States and its predecessor colonies between 1608 and 1991. From 1930 to 2002, there were 4,661 executions in the United States; about two-thirds of them in the first 20 years. Additionally, the United States Army executed 135 soldiers between 1916 and 1961 (the most recent).

===Early abolition movement===

Three states abolished the death penalty for murder during the 19th century: Michigan (which Only executed 1 prisoner and is the first government in the English-speaking world to abolish capital punishment) in 1847, Wisconsin in 1853, and Maine in 1887. Rhode Island is also a state with a long abolitionist background, having repealed the death penalty in 1852, though it was available for murder committed by a prisoner between 1872 and 1984.

Other states which abolished the death penalty for murder before &quot;Gregg v. Georgia&quot; include Minnesota in 1911, Vermont in 1964, Iowa and West Virginia in 1965, and North Dakota in 1973. Hawaii abolished the death penalty in 1948 and Alaska in 1957, both before their statehood. Puerto Rico repealed it in 1929 and the District of Columbia in 1981. Arizona and Oregon abolished the death penalty by popular vote in 1916 and 1964 respectively, but both reinstated it, again by popular vote, some years later; Arizona reinstated the death penalty in 1918 and Oregon in 1978. In Oregon, the measure reinstating the death penalty was overturned by the Oregon Supreme Court in 1981, but Oregon voters again reinstated the death penalty in 1984. Puerto Rico and Michigan are the only two U.S. jurisdictions to have explicitly prohibited capital punishment in their constitutions: in 1952 and 1964, respectively.

===Constitutional law developments===
Capital punishment was used by 6 of 50 states in 2022. They were Alabama, Arizona, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. Government executions, as reported by Amnesty International, took place in 20 of the world&#x27;s 195 countries. The Federal government of the United States, which had not executed a prisoner since 2003, did so in 2020, in an effort led by President Donald Trump and Attorney General William Barr.

Executions for various crimes, especially murder and rape, occurred from the creation of the United States up to the early 1960s. Until then, &quot;save for a few mavericks, no one gave any credence to the possibility of ending the death penalty by judicial interpretation of constitutional law&quot;, according to abolitionist Hugo Bedau.

The possibility of challenging the constitutionality of the death penalty became progressively more realistic after the Supreme Court of the United States decided on &quot;Trop v. Dulles&quot; in 1958. The Supreme Court declared explicitly, for the first time, that the Eighth Amendment&#x27;s cruel and unusual punishment clause must draw its meaning from the &quot;evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society&quot;, rather than from its original meaning. Also in the 1932 case &quot;Powell v. Alabama&quot;, the court made the first step of what would later be called &quot;death is different&quot; jurisprudence, when it held that any indigent defendant was entitled to a court-appointed attorney in capital cases – a right that was only later extended to non-capital defendants in 1963, with &quot;Gideon v. Wainwright&quot;.

===Capital punishment suspended (1972)===
In &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot;, the U.S. Supreme Court considered a group of consolidated cases. The lead case involved an individual convicted under Georgia&#x27;s death penalty statute, which featured a &quot;unitary trial&quot; procedure in which the jury was asked to return a verdict of guilt or innocence and, simultaneously, determine whether the defendant would be punished by death or life imprisonment. The last pre-&quot;Furman&quot; execution was that of Luis Monge on June 2, 1967.

In a 5–4 decision, the Supreme Court struck down the impositions of the death penalty in each of the consolidated cases as unconstitutional in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. The Supreme Court has never ruled the death penalty to be &quot;per se&quot; unconstitutional. The five justices in the majority did not produce a common opinion or rationale for their decision, however, and agreed only on a short statement announcing the result. The narrowest opinions, those of Byron White and Potter Stewart, expressed generalized concerns about the inconsistent application of the death penalty across a variety of cases, but did not exclude the possibility of a constitutional death penalty law. Stewart and William O. Douglas worried explicitly about racial discrimination in enforcement of the death penalty. Thurgood Marshall and William J. Brennan Jr. expressed the opinion that the death penalty was proscribed absolutely by the Eighth Amendment as cruel and unusual punishment. This decision was reached by the suspicion that many states, particularly in the South, were using capital punishment as a form of legal lynching of African-American males, inasmuch as almost all executions for non-homicidal rape in the Southern states involved a black perpetrator, and this suspicion was fueled by cases such as the Martinsville Seven, when seven African-American men were executed by Virginia in 1951 for the gang rape of a white woman.

The &quot;Furman&quot; decision caused all death sentences pending at the time to be reduced to life imprisonment, and was described by scholars as a &quot;legal bombshell&quot;. The next day, columnist Barry Schweid wrote that it was &quot;unlikely&quot; that the death penalty could exist anymore in the United States.

===Capital punishment reinstated (1976)===
Instead of abandoning capital punishment, 37 states enacted new death penalty statutes that attempted to address the concerns of White and Stewart in &quot;Furman&quot;. Some states responded by enacting mandatory death penalty statutes which prescribed a sentence of death for anyone convicted of certain forms of murder. White had hinted that such a scheme would meet his constitutional concerns in his &quot;Furman&quot; opinion. Other states adopted &quot;bifurcated&quot; trial and sentencing procedures, with various procedural limitations on the jury&#x27;s ability to pronounce a death sentence designed to limit juror discretion.

On July 2, 1976, the U.S. Supreme Court decided &quot;Gregg v. Georgia&quot; and upheld 7–2 a Georgia procedure in which the trial of capital crimes was bifurcated into guilt-innocence and sentencing phases. At the first proceeding, the jury decides the defendant&#x27;s guilt; if the defendant is innocent or otherwise not convicted of first-degree murder, the death penalty will not be imposed. At the second hearing, the jury determines whether certain statutory aggravating factors exist, whether any mitigating factors exist, and, in many jurisdictions, weigh the aggravating and mitigating factors in assessing the ultimate penalty – either death or life in prison, either with or without parole. The same day, in &quot;Woodson v. North Carolina&quot; and &quot;Roberts v. Louisiana&quot;, the court struck down 5–4 statutes providing a mandatory death sentence.

Executions resumed on January 17, 1977, when Gary Gilmore went before a firing squad in Utah. Although hundreds of individuals were sentenced to death in the United States during the 1970s and early 1980s, only ten people besides Gilmore (who had waived all of his appeal rights) were executed prior to 1984.

Following the decision, the use of capital punishment in the United States soared. This was in contrast to trends in other parts of advanced industrial democracies where the use of capital punishment declined or was prohibited. Members of the Council of Europe comply with the European Convention of Human Rights which prohibits capital punishment. The last execution in the UK took place in 1964, and in 1977 in France.

===Supreme Court narrows capital offenses===

In 1977, the Supreme Court&#x27;s &quot;Coker v. Georgia&quot; decision barred the death penalty for rape of an adult woman. Previously, the death penalty for rape of an adult had been gradually phased out in the United States, and at the time of the decision, Georgia and the Federal government were the only two jurisdictions to still retain the death penalty for this offense.

In the 1980 case &quot;Godfrey v. Georgia&quot;, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that murder can be punished by death only if it involves a narrow and precise aggravating factor.

The U.S. Supreme Court has placed two major restrictions on the use of the death penalty. First, the case of &quot;Atkins v. Virginia&quot;, decided on June 20, 2002, held that the execution of intellectually disabled inmates is unconstitutional. Second, in 2005, the court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Roper v. Simmons&quot; struck down executions for offenders under the age of 18 at the time of the crime. As of 2018, some recalcitrant states continue to deviate from the 2002 decision.

In the 2008 case &quot;Kennedy v. Louisiana&quot;, the court also held 5–4 that the death penalty is unconstitutional when applied to non-homicidal crimes against the person, including child rape. Only two death row inmates (both in Louisiana) were affected by the decision. Nevertheless, the ruling came less than five months before the 2008 presidential election and was criticized by both major party candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.

In 2023 and 2024, Florida and Tennessee passed laws that could challenge the Kennedy v. Louisiana decision.

===Repeal movements and legal challenges===
In 2004, New York&#x27;s and Kansas&#x27; capital sentencing schemes were struck down by their respective states&#x27; highest courts. Kansas successfully appealed the Kansas Supreme Court decision to the United States Supreme Court, which reinstated the statute in &quot;Kansas v. Marsh&quot; (2006), holding it did not violate the U.S. Constitution. The decision of the New York Court of Appeals was based on the state constitution, making unavailable any appeal. The state lower house has since blocked all attempts to reinstate the death penalty by adopting a valid sentencing scheme. In 2016, Delaware&#x27;s death penalty statute was also struck down by its state supreme court.

In 2007, New Jersey became the first state to repeal the death penalty by legislative vote since &quot;Gregg v. Georgia&quot;, followed by New Mexico in 2009, Illinois in 2011, Connecticut in 2012, and Maryland in 2013. The repeals were not retroactive, but in New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland, governors commuted all death sentences after enacting the new law. In Connecticut, the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled in 2015 that the repeal must be retroactive. In New Mexico, capital punishment for certain offenses is still possible for National Guard members in Title 32 status under the state&#x27;s Code of Military Justice (NMSA 20–12), and for capital offenses committed prior to the repeal of the state&#x27;s death penalty statute.

Nebraska&#x27;s legislature also passed a repeal in 2015, but a referendum campaign gathered enough signatures to suspend it. Capital punishment was reinstated by popular vote on November 8, 2016. The same day, California&#x27;s electorate defeated a proposal to repeal the death penalty, and adopted another initiative to speed up its appeal process.

On October 11, 2018, Washington state became the 20th state to abolish capital punishment when its state Supreme Court deemed the death penalty unconstitutional on the grounds of racial bias. The state later abolished it through legislation passed in 2023.

New Hampshire became the 21st state to abolish capital punishment on May 30, 2019, when its state senate overrode Governor Sununu&#x27;s veto by a vote of 16–8.

Colorado became the 22nd state to abolish capital punishment when governor Jared Polis signed a repeal bill on March 23, 2020, and commuted all existing death sentences in the state to life without parole.

Virginia became the 23rd state to abolish capital punishment, and the first Southern state to do so when governor Ralph Northam signed a repeal bill on March 24, 2021, and commuted all existing death sentences in the state to life without parole.

Since &quot;Furman&quot;, 11 states have organized popular votes dealing with the death penalty through the initiative and referendum process. All resulted in a vote for reinstating it, rejecting its abolition, expanding its application field, specifying in the state constitution that it is not unconstitutional, or expediting the appeal process in capital cases.

The advocacy group Conservatives Concerned About the Death Penalty is creating a national network of Republican and Libertarian legislators at the state level to introduce bills aimed at abolishing or limiting the death penalty. The issue is framed along the values of pro-life, limited government, and fiscal responsibility.

==== States that have abolished the death penalty ====
A total of 23 states, plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have abolished the death penalty for all crimes. Below is a table of the states and the date that the state abolished the death penalty. Michigan became the first English-speaking territory in the world to abolish capital punishment in 1847. Although treason remained a crime punishable by the death penalty in Michigan despite the 1847 abolition, no one was ever executed under that law, and Michigan&#x27;s 1962 Constitutional Convention codified that the death penalty was fully abolished. Vermont has abolished the death penalty for all crimes, but has an invalid death penalty statue for treason. When it abolished the death penalty in 2019, New Hampshire explicitly did not commute the death sentence of the sole person remaining on the state&#x27;s death row, Michael K. Addison.

===Modern era===

In 1982, Texas carried out the first execution by lethal injection in world history and lethal injection subsequently became the preferred method throughout the country, displacing the electric chair. From 1976 to December 8, 2016, there were 1,533 executions, of which 1,349 were by lethal injection, 163 by electrocution, 11 by gas inhalation, 3 by hanging, and 3 by firing squad. The South had the great majority of these executions, with 1,249; there were 190 in the Midwest, 86 in the West, and only 4 in the Northeast. No state in the Northeast has conducted an execution since Connecticut, now abolitionist, in 2005. The state of Texas alone conducted 571 executions, over 1/3 of the total; the states of Texas, Virginia (now abolitionist), and Oklahoma combined make up over half the total, with 802 executions between them. 17 executions have been conducted by the federal government. Executions increased in frequency until 1999; 98 prisoners were executed that year. Since 1999, the number of executions has greatly decreased, and the 17 executions in 2020 were the fewest since 1991. A 2016 poll conducted by Pew Research, found that support nationwide for the death penalty in the U.S. had fallen below 50% for the first time since the beginning of the post-Gregg era.

The death penalty became an issue during the 1988 presidential election. It came up in the October 13, 1988, debate between the two presidential nominees George H. W. Bush and Michael Dukakis, when Bernard Shaw, the moderator of the debate, asked Dukakis, &quot;Governor, if Kitty Dukakis [his wife] were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?&quot; Dukakis replied, &quot;No, I don&#x27;t, and I think you know that I&#x27;ve opposed the death penalty during all of my life. I don&#x27;t see any evidence that it&#x27;s a deterrent, and I think there are better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime.&quot; Bush was elected, and many, including Dukakis himself, cite the statement as the beginning of the end of his campaign.

In 1996, Congress passed the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act to streamline the appeal process in capital cases. The bill was signed into law by President Bill Clinton, who had endorsed capital punishment during his 1992 presidential campaign.

A study found that at least 34 of the 749 executions carried out in the U.S. between 1977 and 2001, or 4.5%, involved &quot;unanticipated problems or delays that caused, at least arguably, unnecessary agony for the prisoner or that reflect gross incompetence of the executioner&quot;. The rate of these &quot;botched executions&quot; remained steady over the period. A study published in &quot;The Lancet&quot; in 2005 found that in 43% of cases of lethal injection, the blood level of hypnotics in the prisoner was insufficient to ensure unconsciousness. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court ruled in 2008 (&quot;Baze v. Rees&quot;), again in 2015 (&quot;Glossip v. Gross&quot;), and a third time in 2019 (&quot;Bucklew v. Precythe&quot;), that lethal injection does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.

On July 25, 2019, Attorney General William Barr ordered the resumption of federal executions after a 16-year hiatus, and set five execution dates for December 2019 and January 2020. After the Supreme Court upheld a stay on these executions, the stay was lifted in June 2020 and four executions were rescheduled for July and August 2020. The federal government executed Daniel Lewis Lee on July 14, 2020. He became the first convict executed by the federal government since 2003. Before Trump&#x27;s term ended in January 2021, the federal government carried out a total of 13 executions.

=== Women&#x27;s history and capital punishment ===
In 1632, 24 years after the first recorded male execution in the colonies, Jane Champion became the first woman known to have been lawfully executed. She was sentenced to death by hanging after she was convicted of infanticide; around two-thirds of women executed in the 17th and early 18th centuries were convicted of child murder. Champion was a married woman; it is not known whether her illicit lover, William Gallopin, also convicted of their child&#x27;s murder, was also executed, although it appears he was sentenced to death. For the Puritans, infanticide was the worst form of murder.

Women accounted for just one fifth of all executions between 1632 and 1759, in the colonial United States. Women were more likely to be acquitted, and the relatively low number of executions of women may have been impacted by the scarcity of female laborers. Slavery was not yet widespread in the 17th century mainland and planters relied mostly on Irish indentured servants. To maintain subsistence levels in those days everyone had to do farm work, including women.

The second half of the 17th century saw the executions of 14 women and 6 men who were accused of witchcraft during the witch hunt hysteria and the Salem Witch Trials. While both men and women were executed, 80% of the accusations were towards women, so the list of executions disproportionately affected men by a margin of 6 (actual) to 4 (expected), i.e. 50% more men were executed than expected from the percentage of accused who were men.

Other notable female executions include Mary Surratt, Margie Velma Barfield and Wanda Jean Allen. Mary Surratt was executed by hanging in 1865 after being convicted of co-conspiring to assassinate Abraham Lincoln. Margie Velma Barfield was convicted of murder and when she was executed by lethal injection in 1984, she became the first woman to be executed since the ban on capital punishment was lifted in 1976. Wanda Jean Allen was convicted of murder in 1989 and had a high-profile execution by lethal injection in January 2001. She was the first black woman to be executed in the US since 1954. Allen&#x27;s appellate lawyers did not deny her guilt, but claimed that prosecutors capitalized on her low IQ, race and homosexuality in their representations of her as a murderer at trial. This approach did not work.

The federal government executes women infrequently. Ethel Rosenberg, convicted of espionage, was executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953, and Bonnie Brown Heady, convicted of kidnapping and murder, was executed in the gas chamber later that same year on December 18. Since Heady, only one more woman has been executed by the federal government: Lisa Montgomery, convicted of killing a pregnant woman and cutting out and kidnapping her baby, by lethal injection on January 13, 2021. Her execution had been stayed while her lawyers argued that she had mental health issues, but the Supreme Court lifted the stay.

=== Juvenile capital punishment ===
In 1642, the first ever juvenile, Thomas Graunger, was sentenced to death in Plymouth Colony, Massachusetts, for bestiality. Since then, at least 361 other juveniles have been sentenced to the death penalty. In 1959, Leonard Shockley was executed in Maryland, becoming the last person in the United States who was executed while still a juvenile at the time of their execution. &quot;Kent v. United States&quot; (1966), turned the tides for juvenile capital punishment sentencing when it limited the waiver discretion juvenile courts had. Before this case, juvenile courts had the freedom to waiver juvenile cases to criminal courts without a hearing, which did not make the waiving process consistent across states. Discussions about abolishing the death penalty started occurring between 1983 and 1986. In 1987, &quot;Thompson v. Oklahoma&quot;, the Supreme Court threw away William Wayne Thompson&#x27;s death sentence due to it being cruel and unusual punishment, as he was 15 years old at the time of the crime he committed; the judgment established that &quot;evolving standards of decency&quot; made it inappropriate to apply the death penalty for people under 16 years old at the time of their capital crime, although &quot;Thompson&quot; held that it was still constitutional to sentence juveniles 16 years or older to the death penalty.

It was not until &quot;Roper v. Simmons&quot; that the juvenile death penalty was abolished due to the United States Supreme Court finding that the execution of juveniles is in conflict with the Eighth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment, which deal with cruel and unusual punishment. Prior to completely abolishing the juvenile death penalty in 2005, any juvenile aged 16 years or older could be sentenced to death in some states, the last of whom was Scott Hain, executed at the age of 32 in Oklahoma for the 2003 burning of two people to death during a robbery at age 17. Prior to &quot;Roper&quot;, there were 71 people on death row in the United States for crimes committed as juveniles. Since 2005, there have been no executions nor discussion of executing juveniles in the United States.

==Capital crimes==
===Aggravated murder===
Aggravating factors for seeking capital punishment of murder vary greatly among death penalty states. California has twenty-two. Some aggravating circumstances are nearly universal, such as robbery-murder, murder involving rape of the victim, and murder of an on-duty police officer.

Several states have included child murder to their list of aggravating factors, but the victim&#x27;s age under which the murder is punishable by death varies. In 2011, Texas raised this age from six to ten.

In some states, the high number of aggravating factors has been criticized on account of giving prosecutors too much discretion in choosing cases where they believe capital punishment is warranted. In California especially, an official commission proposed, in 2008, to reduce these factors to five (multiple murders, torture murder, murder of a police officer, murder committed in jail, and murder related to another felony). Columnist Charles Lane went further, and proposed that murder related to a felony other than rape should no longer be a capital crime when there is only one victim killed.

==== Aggravating factors in federal court ====
In order for a person to be eligible for a death sentence when convicted of aggravated first-degree murder, the jury or court (when there is not a jury) must determine at least one of sixteen aggravating factors that existed during the crime&#x27;s commission. The following is a list of the 16 aggravating factors under federal law.

# Murder while committing another felony.
# Offender was convicted of a separate felony involving a firearm prior to the aggravated murder.
# Being convicted of a separate felony where death or life imprisonment was authorized prior to the aggravated murder.
# Being convicted of any separate violent felony prior to the aggravated murder.
# The offender put the lives of at least 1 or more other persons in danger of death during the commission of the crime.
# Offender committed the crime in an especially cruel, heinous, or depraved manner.
# Offender committed the crime for financial gain.
# Offender committed the crime for monetary gain.
# The murder was premeditated, involved planning in order to be carried out, or the offender showed early signs of committing the crime, such as keeping a journal of the crime&#x27;s details and posting things on the Internet.
# Offender was previously convicted of at least two drug offenses.
# The victim would not have been able to defend themselves while being attacked.
# Offender was previously convicted of a federal drug offense.
# Offender was involved in a long-term business of selling drugs to minors.
# A high-ranking official was murdered, such as the president of the United States, the leader of another country, or a police officer.
# Offender was previously convicted of sexual assault or child rape.
# During the crime&#x27;s commission, the offender killed or tried to kill multiple people.

===Crimes against the state===
The opinion of the court in &quot;Kennedy v. Louisiana&quot; says that the ruling does not apply to &quot;treason, espionage, terrorism, and drug kingpin activity, which are offenses against the State&quot;.

Treason, espionage and large-scale drug trafficking are all capital crimes under federal law. Treason is also punishable by death in six states (Arkansas, California, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina). Large-scale drug trafficking is punishable by death in two states (Florida and Missouri), and aircraft hijacking in two others (Georgia and Mississippi). Vermont has an invalidated pre-&quot;Furman&quot; statute allowing capital punishment for treason despite abolishing capital punishment in 1965.

==Legal process==
The legal administration of the death penalty in the United States typically involves five steps: prosecutorial decision to seek the death penalty, sentencing, direct review, state collateral review, and federal habeas corpus.

Clemency, through which the governor or president of the jurisdiction can unilaterally reduce or abrogate a death sentence, is an executive rather than judicial process.

===Decision to seek the death penalty===
While judges in criminal cases can usually impose a harsher prison sentence than the one demanded by prosecution, the death penalty can be handed down only if the accuser has specifically decided to seek it.

In the decades since &quot;Furman&quot;, new questions have emerged about whether or not prosecutorial arbitrariness has replaced sentencing arbitrariness. A study by Pepperdine University School of Law published in &quot;Temple Law Review&quot;, surveyed the decision-making process among prosecutors in various states. The authors found that prosecutors&#x27; capital punishment filing decisions are marked by local &quot;idiosyncrasies&quot;, and that wide prosecutorial discretion remains because of overly broad criteria. California law, for example, has 22 &quot;special circumstances&quot;, making nearly all first-degree murders potential capital cases.

A proposed remedy against prosecutorial arbitrariness is to transfer the prosecution of capital cases to the state attorney general.

In 2017, Florida governor Rick Scott removed all capital cases from local prosecutor Aramis Ayala because she decided to never seek the death penalty no matter the gravity of the crime.

===Sentencing===
Of the 27 states with the death penalty, 25 require the sentence to be decided by the jury, and 23 require a unanimous decision by the jury.

Two states do not use juries in death penalty cases: 
* In Nebraska the sentence is decided by a three-judge panel, which must unanimously agree on death, and the defendant is sentenced to life imprisonment if one of the judges is opposed. 
* Montana is the only state where the trial judge decides the sentence alone. 
Two states do not require a unanimous jury decision:
* In Alabama, at least 10 jurors must concur, and a retrial happens if the jury deadlocks. 
* In Florida, at least 8 jurors (two-thirds) must concur, and the prosecution can pursue a retrial if the jury deadlocks.

In all states in which the jury is involved, only death-qualified prospective jurors can be selected in such a jury, to exclude both people who will always vote for the death sentence and those who are categorically opposed to it. However, the states differ on what happens if the penalty phase results in a hung jury:
* In five states (Alabama, Arizona, California, Kentucky and Nevada), a retrial of the penalty phase will be conducted before a different jury (the common-law rule for mistrial).
* In two states (Indiana and Missouri), the judge will decide the sentence.
* In the remaining states, a hung jury results in a life sentence, even if only one juror opposed death. Federal law also provides that outcome.

The first outcome is referred as the &quot;true unanimity&quot; rule, while the third has been criticized as the &quot;single-juror veto&quot; rule.

===Direct review===
If a defendant is sentenced to death at the trial level, the case then goes into a direct review. The direct review process is a typical legal appeal. An appellate court examines the record of evidence presented in the trial court and the law that the lower court applied and decides whether the decision was legally sound or not. Direct review of a capital sentencing hearing will result in one of three outcomes. If the appellate court finds that no significant legal errors occurred in the capital sentencing hearing, the appellate court will affirm the judgment, or let the sentence stand. If the appellate court finds that significant legal errors did occur, then it will reverse the judgment, or nullify the sentence and order a new capital sentencing hearing. If the appellate court finds that no reasonable juror could find the defendant eligible for the death penalty, then it will order the defendant acquitted, or not guilty, of the crime for which he/she was given the death penalty, and order him sentenced to the next most severe punishment for which the offense is eligible. In 1995, about 60 percent of capital punishment decisions were upheld during direct review.

===State collateral review===
At times when a death sentence is affirmed on direct review, supplemental methods to oppose the judgment, though less familiar than a typical appeal, do remain. These supplemental remedies are considered collateral review, that is, an avenue for upsetting judgments that have become otherwise final. Where the prisoner received his death sentence in a state-level trial, as is usually the case, the first step in collateral review is state collateral review, which is often called state habeas corpus. (If the case is a federal death penalty case, it proceeds immediately from direct review to federal habeas corpus.) Although all states have some type of collateral review, the process varies widely from state to state. Generally, the purpose of these collateral proceedings is to permit the prisoner to challenge his sentence on grounds that could not have been raised reasonably at trial or on direct review. Most often, these are claims, such as ineffective assistance of counsel, which requires the court to consider new evidence outside the original trial record, something courts may not do in an ordinary appeal. State collateral review, though an important step in that it helps define the scope of subsequent review through federal habeas corpus, is rarely successful in and of itself. In 1995, out of the roughly 47% cases which didn&#x27;t survive postconviction review at the state level, 6 percent of death sentences were overturned on state collateral review.
In Virginia, state habeas corpus for condemned men are heard by the state supreme court under exclusive original jurisdiction since 1995, immediately after direct review by the same court. This avoids any proceeding before the lower courts, and is in part why Virginia has the shortest time on average between death sentence and execution (less than eight years) and has executed 113 offenders since 1976 with only five remaining on death row .

To reduce litigation delays, other states require convicts to file their state collateral appeal before the completion of their direct appeal, or provide adjudication of direct and collateral attacks together in a &quot;unitary review&quot;.

===Federal &quot;habeas corpus&quot;===
After a death sentence is affirmed in state collateral review, the prisoner may file for federal &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, which is a unique type of lawsuit that can be brought in federal courts. Federal &quot;habeas corpus&quot; is a type of collateral review, and it is the only way that state prisoners may attack a death sentence in federal court (other than petitions for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court after both direct review and state collateral review). The scope of federal &quot;habeas corpus&quot; is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), which restricted significantly its previous scope. The purpose of federal &quot;habeas corpus&quot; is to ensure that state courts, through the process of direct review and state collateral review, have done a reasonable job in protecting the prisoner&#x27;s federal constitutional rights. Prisoners may also use federal &quot;habeas corpus&quot; suits to bring forth new evidence that they are innocent of the crime, though to be a valid defense at this late stage in the process, evidence of innocence must be truly compelling. In 1995, 21 percent out of the 68 percent death penalty cases which didn&#x27;t survive postconviction review were reversed through federal &quot;habeas corpus&quot;.

James Liebman, a professor of law at Columbia Law School, stated in 1996 that his study found that when &quot;habeas corpus&quot; petitions in death penalty cases were traced from conviction to completion of the case, there was &quot;a 40 percent success rate in all capital cases from 1978 to 1995&quot;. Similarly, a study by Ronald Tabak in a law review article puts the success rate in &quot;habeas corpus&quot; cases involving death row inmates even higher, finding that between &quot;1976 and 1991, approximately 47 percent of the habeas petitions filed by death row inmates were granted&quot;. The different numbers are largely definitional, rather than substantive: Freedam&#x27;s statistics looks at the percentage of all death penalty cases reversed, while the others look only at cases not reversed prior to &quot;habeas corpus&quot; review.

A similar process is available for prisoners sentenced to death by the judgment of a federal court.

The AEDPA also provides an expeditious &quot;habeas&quot; procedure in capital cases for states meeting several requirements set forth in it concerning counsel appointment for death row inmates. Under this program, federal &quot;habeas corpus&quot; for condemned prisoners would be decided in about three years from affirmance of the sentence on state collateral review. In 2006, Congress conferred the determination of whether a state fulfilled the requirements to the U.S. attorney general, with a possible appeal of the state to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. , the Department of Justice has still not granted any certifications.

===Section 1983===
If the federal court refuses to issue a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, the death sentence ordinarily becomes final for all purposes. In recent times, however, prisoners have postponed execution through another avenue of federal litigation; the Civil Rights Act of 1871 – codified at – allows complainants to bring lawsuits against state actors to protect their federal constitutional and statutory rights.

While direct appeals are normally limited to just one and automatically stay the execution of the death sentence, Section 1983 lawsuits are unlimited, but the petitioner will be granted a stay of execution only if the court believes he has a likelihood of success on the merits.

Traditionally, Section 1983 was of limited use for a state prisoner under sentence of death because the Supreme Court has held that &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, not Section 1983, is the only vehicle by which a state prisoner can challenge his judgment of death. In the 2006 &quot;Hill v. McDonough&quot; case, however, the United States Supreme Court approved the use of Section 1983 as a vehicle for challenging a state&#x27;s method of execution as cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The theory is that a prisoner bringing such a challenge is not attacking directly his judgment of death, but rather the means by which that the judgment will be carried out. Therefore, the Supreme Court held in the &quot;Hill&quot; case that a prisoner can use Section 1983 rather than &quot;habeas corpus&quot; to bring the lawsuit. Yet, as Clarence Hill&#x27;s own case shows, lower federal courts have often refused to hear suits challenging methods of execution on the ground that the prisoner brought the claim too late and only for the purposes of delay. Further, the Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Baze v. Rees&quot;, upholding a lethal injection method used by many states, has narrowed the opportunity for relief through Section 1983.

===Execution warrant===
While the execution warrant is issued by the governor in several states, in the vast majority it is a judicial order, issued by a judge or by the state supreme court at the request of the prosecution.

The warrant usually sets an execution day. Some states instead provide a longer period, such as a week-long or 10-day window to carry out the execution. This is designated to avoid issuing a new warrant in case of a last-minute stay of execution that would be vacated only few days or few hours later.

==Distribution of sentences==

In recent years there has been an average of one death sentence for every 200 murder convictions in the United States.

Alabama has the highest &quot;per capita&quot; rate of death sentences. This is because Alabama was one of the few states that allowed judges to override a jury recommendation in favor of life imprisonment, a possibility it removed in March 2017.

According to the Death Penalty Information Center, the top three factors determining whether a convict gets a death sentence in a murder case are not aggravating factors, but instead the location the crime occurred (and thus whether it is in the jurisdiction of a prosecutor aggressively using the death penalty), the quality of legal defense, and the race of the victim (murder of white victims being punished more harshly).

===Among states===
The distribution of death sentences among states is loosely proportional to their populations and murder rates. California, which is the most populous state, also has the largest death row, with over 700 inmates. Wyoming, which is the least populous state, has only one condemned man.

But executions are more frequent (and happen more quickly after sentencing) in conservative states. Texas, which is the second most populous state in the Union, carried out over 500 executions during the post-&quot;Furman&quot; era, more than a third of the national total. California has carried out only 13 executions during the same period, and has carried out none since 2006.

===Among races===

Certain races within the United States are disproportionately incarcerated at higher rates than others. African Americans, who make up only 13.6% of the total population are disproportionately incarcerated in the prison system compared to white Americans.

==== Statistics ====

African Americans make up 41% of death row inmates. African Americans have made up 34% of those actually executed since 1976. Twenty-one white offenders have been executed for the murder of a black person since 1976, compared to the 302 black offenders that have been executed for the murder of a white person during that same period. Most individuals involved in determining the verdict in death penalty cases are white. As of 1998, Chief District Attorneys in counties using the death penalty are 98% white and only 1% are African-American. A supporting fact discovered through examinations of racial disparities over the past twenty years concerning race and the death penalty found that in 96% of these reviews, there was &quot;a pattern of either race-of-victim or race-of-defendant discrimination or both.&quot; 80% of all capital cases involve white victims, despite white people only making up approximately 50% of murder victims.

With regard to exonerated convicts, 54 percent of people wrongfully convicted and sentenced to death in the United States are black; 64 percent are non-white in general.

63.8% of white death row inmates, 72.8% of black death row inmates, 65.4% of Latino death row inmates, and 63.8% of Native American death row inmates – or approximately 67% of death row inmates overall – have a prior felony conviction. Approximately 13.5% of death row inmates are of Hispanic or Latino descent. In 2019, individuals identified as Hispanic and Latino Americans accounted for 5.5% of homicides. The death penalty exhortation rate for Hispanic and Latino Americans is 8.6%. Approximately 1.81% of death row inmates are of Asian descent.

==== Organizations against the death penalty for racial equity ====

===== ACLU&#x27;s Capital Punishment Project =====
The American Civil Liberties Union&#x27;s Capital Punishment Project (CPP) is an anti-death penalty project that works toward the repeal of the death penalty in the U.S. through advocacy and education. The project highlights the racial discriminatory aspects regarding capital punishment and promotes both abolition and systemic reform of the death penalty through direct representation, strategic litigation, and systemic reform.

===== Equal Justice USA =====
Equal Justice USA is a national organization dedicated to healing, racial equity, and community safety in relation to criminal justice and violence. Their efforts spread wide and involve fundraising and hosting conventions to support communities of color. The organization is aimed towards people of color who have been disproportionately impacted by the death penalty. Some of their efforts include advocacy to end the death penalty, which they have helped to abolish in nine states.

==== Black Americans and capital punishment ====
The geographic distribution of capital punishment in the United States has a strong correlation with the history of slavery and lynchings. States where slavery was legal before the Civil War also saw high numbers of lynchings after the Civil War and into the 20th century. These states include Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. These states also introduced a criminal justice system with Black Codes, designed to control Black people after slavery was abolished in 1865 following the Emancipation Proclamation, and then officially with the ratification of the 13th Amendment. These states also have the highest rates of capital punishment sentences and executions today.

===== Racial relationship between lynchings and capital punishment =====
Once slaveowners lost full ownership of formerly enslaved African-Americans in 1865, lynchings were increasingly used, both legally under the security of Black Codes and illegally, to maintain white dominance and prevent African-Americans from challenging their subordinate place in society. Because of Black Codes, many African-Americans were sent to jail to participate in slave-like work in a system known as Convict leasing. Others faced capital punishment for alleged crimes, often in the form of lynching. Lynchings were able to be carried out because many positions within southern law enforcement, including state officials, and judges were held by former Confederate soldiers. Despite the passing of the Reconstruction Act of 1867, which weakened the strength of Black Codes and supported the 14th Amendment, the rate of lynching of African-Americans saw an increase, due the formation of the white-supremacist terrorist group, the Ku Klux Klan (K.K.K.), in 1865 by former Confederates during Reconstruction. They carried out many lynchings and terrorist attacks against Black people. After the end of the Reconstruction in 1877, when federal troops were removed from southern states in which they assisted in upholding the 14th Amendment&#x27;s promises of equal protection, Jim Crow laws began to gain traction which enforced segregation and the oppression of African-Americans. Segregation was legal under the 1896 Supreme Court decision &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; until the Civil Rights Act of 1964 made it unconstitutional.

During and following the Civil Rights era, laws were introduced to prevent illegal lynchings by the general public. According to David Rigby and Charles Seguin, the popularity of capital punishment increased as a way for White people to control Black people and instill fear. They argue that the disproportionate number of Black Americans sentenced to death during the 20th century, often wrongfully convicted, shows that capital punishment was used as a way for White people to control Black people in a similar manner to lynching. In 1972, the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot; that capital punishment was unconstitutional. Rigby and Seguin argue that this led to an increase in the illegal lynchings of African-Americans. In 1976 the Supreme Court decision in &quot;Gregg v. Georgia&quot; upheld the death penalty and overturned &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot;. Rigby and Seguin argue that this decision was based on a fear that lynchings by the general public would increase if the death penalty did not remain in place.

Although more than 6,500 lynchings occurred between 1865 and 1950 according to the Equal Justice Initiative, lynching did not become a federal crime until 2022 under the Emmett Till Antilynching Act, which was signed into law by President Joe Biden, over a hundred years after Antilynching legislation was first proposed.

21st century legal scholars, Civil Rights lawyers, and advocates, like Michelle Alexander, often refer to both past and modern police officers and officials of the United States&#x27; criminal justice system&#x27;s as legalized, modern lynch mobs because they have the ability to sentence one to life in prison or with the death penalty under the law but with the jurisdiction of potentially incorporating their personal, racial biases. The ability for a Black person to be convicted to death, with the potential that racial bias was used in their sentencing, was upheld during the &quot;McCleskey v. Kemp&quot; court case in Georgia. Groups like the NAACP&#x27;s Legal Defense Fund (LDF) have continuously worked and continue to work on abolishing capital punishment based on its historically racist associations with enslavement and lynching, and also its disproportionate impact on racial minority communities.

===== Racial breakdown of sentences by state =====
Capital punishment is still active in 27 states, which including the following: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Wyoming. Of these, Oklahoma, Texas, Delaware, Missouri, and Alabama make up the top five states with the highest &quot;rate&quot; of executions per capita. However, Texas, Oklahoma, Virginia, Florida, and Missouri are the top five states with the highest &quot;number&quot; of executions–Texas alone has imposed 570 executions since 1976.

The racial makeup of the people sentenced to death reveals a disproportionate representation of Black people. Consider the following states with the highest execution rates per capita (defined as executions per 100,000 residents):

====== Top five states with the highest rates of execution per capita ======
====== Texas ======
Capital punishment in Texas: Texas is the state with the highest number of cumulative executions since 1976. Black people make up about 45% of the current death row population in Texas, though only make up about 13% of the state&#x27;s general population.

====== Oklahoma ======
Capital punishment in Oklahoma: Oklahoma is the state with the second highest number of cumulative executions since 1976. Black people make up 46% of death sentences in Oklahoma County, though only make up 16% of the county&#x27;s total population.

It is also the only state that has four methods of execution, while most others only have one or two methods. These methods of execution include: lethal injection, nitrogen hypoxia, electrocution, and firing squad.

====== Alabama ======
Capital punishment in Alabama: Alabama&#x27;s death penalty sentences persist as it declines among many other states in the U.S. The state continues to have one of the nation&#x27;s highest rates of death sentences per capita. As of April 1, 2022, there are currently 80 Black people and 84 white people on death row. Though the Black and white populations are both about half of the total death row population in Alabama, Black people are represented at a disproportionately high number considering they make up only 27% of Alabama&#x27;s general population.

====== Virginia ======
Capital punishment in Virginia: The death penalty in Virginia came to an end on March 24, 2021, when the state became the first Southern state to abolish the death penalty. Prior to abolition, Virginia had some of the most executions out of any state since 1976, as well as the most executions overall in the pre-&quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot; era.

===== Exonerations =====
Exonerations, in relation to the death penalty, are defined as the absolving of someone from their previous verdict of guilty and sentencing of death. Since January 1, 1973, 108 out of the 200 total exonerations have been African Americans. African Americans account for about 54% of all exonerations. As of 2013, over 140 persons sentenced to death, since 1973, had their convictions overturned or received full pardons. Eighteen prisoners of them have been exonerated on the basis of DNA evidence In 2009, the Supreme Court held that there is no constitutional right post-conviction DNA testing for convicted prisoners. Forty-eight states have post-conviction DNA testing statutes. However, fewer than half the states have statutes that give inmates time and money for post-conviction DNA testing. There is widespread public support for such a system.

During the middle of the 20th century, a period of mass incarceration occurred in the United States. The United States became the country with the highest incarceration rate which caused the prison population to become heavily Black by the 1990s whereas it was mainly only white in previous years. White people accounted for 51% of the prison population while Black people accounted for 47% of the entire prison population during the 1990s. Even though Black people made up of around half the jail inhabitants, they only were 12.1% of the United States population and white citizens made up 80.3% of the total population during that time. The prison population had increased from 196,441 people in 1970 to 1.6 million by 2008. This discrepancy of races in the prison population related to the overall demographics of the United States has to do with the inconsistency of police arrests on citizens. Moving into 2015, Black people still made up only 12.1% of the total population but made up 18% of people who were stopped by police on the road. This led to the increase of disproportionate demographics in local jails and prison systems. By 2018, 592 Black people were in local jails per every 100,000 people and 2,271 Black men were incarcerated in federal prisons per 100,000 people. On the other hand, white people were incarcerated at a rate of 187 per 100,000 people in local jails and white men, at the federal level, were incarcerated at a rate of 392 per 100,000 people. This dramatic increase in Black arrests caused America&#x27;s prison population to boom, which was all due to this long lasting period of mass incarceration.

Mass incarceration had been increasing and there are many factors sustaining its rise. From over-policing to disproportionately long prison sentences, Black people have been targeted in mass incarceration and as a result, more susceptible to capital punishment.

===== Cases =====
With the United States&#x27; operation based on the U.S. Constitution, federalism allows the state government to share powers with the federal government. Under the various capacities, different court cases are heard in the national and state court systems. A defendant can be inflicted with the death penalty if they are found condemned of capital offenses,&lt;ref name=&quot;LII / Legal Information Institute&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; like first-degree murder, murder with special circumstances, treason, or genocide. Because capital offenses are criminal cases, the state court systems are responsible to hear the majority of them. The Supreme Court and state courts&#x27; discretion in keeping the death penalty option are separate for the most part, if not appealed to the Supreme Court. According to the Legal Information Institute, &quot;it is not necessary that the actual punishment imposed was the death penalty, but rather a capital office is classified as such if the permissible punishment prescribed by the legislature for the offense is the death penalty.&quot; After &quot;Roper v. Simmons&quot; in 2005, the federal court deemed if the defendant was under 18 years old at the time of the crime, they can not be sentenced to death because it violates the 8th Amendment.

====== George Stinney Jr. ======

In 1944, 14-year-old African-American George Stinney Jr. was convicted of murdering two white girls. He was the youngest person in the United States to be sentenced to death. Stinney was executed by electrocution within 80 days of the murders. In 2014, Stinney&#x27;s convictions were vacated and he was exonerated on the grounds that his 6th amendment rights had been violated. It was found Stinney&#x27;s interrogation had included coercion, and an absence of counsel and of parental guidance. Police said that Stinney had confessed, but no signed confession was ever produced. The Judge who overturned the conviction wrote that: &quot;Stinney&#x27;s appointed counsel made no independent investigation, did not request a change of venue or additional time to prepare the case, he asked little or no questions on cross-examination of the State&#x27;s witnesses and presented few or no witnesses on behalf of his client based on the length of trial. He failed to file an appeal or a stay of execution.&quot; Stinney&#x27;s sister said in a 2009 affidavit that she was with Stinney on the day of the murders, but she was never called to testify during the trial.

====== Exonerated Five ======
The systemic issue of biased investigation conduct is also seen in the Exonerated Five case. The Exonerated Five is made up of one Latino boy, Raymond Santana, and four black youths, Kevin Richardson, Antron McCray, Yusef Salaam, and Korey Wise. They are formerly known as the Central Park Five and the Jogger Case. The boys received mixed convictions for assault, robbery, riot, rape, sexual abuse, and attempted murder of a white woman in 1990.

The boys faced intense, un-recorded interrogations for at least seven hours in the absence of legal counsel, with video confessions following, beside Salaam. Wise additionally had no parent present during questioning and confessing. The five youths later pleaded not guilty and recanted their statements because they were produced under intimidation. Despite no DNA evidence linking any of the boys to the crime scene, they were sentenced to 5 to 15 years. After 12 years, the sole perpetrator, Matias Reyes, confessed to the crime while providing a DNA match to the only DNA selection found at the scene. Their false confessions were recognized for inconsistencies and their convictions were vacated in December 2002. They later sued the state and the city for reparations and received approximately $44 million in a settlement.

During the 1990 trial, Donald Trump (still a minor celebrity at the time) bought full-page ads voicing his reaction to the Central Park case. In the ad, Donald Trump says the following:

&quot;I want to hate these muggers and murderers. They should be forced to suffer and, when they kill, they should be executed for their crimes. They must serve as examples so that others will think long and hard before committing a crime or an act of violence.&quot;

The youths ranged from the ages of 14–16 years when the ad was released. In an archival interview with Larry King, Trump feels his belief is a common feeling because he received 15,000 letters of praise following the ad. In retrospect, Salaam reflects in a 2021 interview with &quot;PBS MetroFocus&quot;, saying:

&quot;I look at what Donald Trump as being the nails that sealed us in the coffin. And then what happened after that, they published our names, our addresses, and phone numbers in the New York City newspapers. When you think about Donald Trump’s ad, it was a whisper into society to have someone come to our homes to drag us from our beds, and to do to us what they had done to Emmett Till.&quot;

Because the youths were minors, their identities were supposed to remain confidential. Salaam shares that his family received an insurgence of death threats following Trump&#x27;s advertisement, culminating in a climate of aggressive hate. A Central Park Five representative comments that Trump&#x27;s ad influenced public opinion, possibly further tainting the impartiality of potential jurors &quot;who [already], had a natural affinity for the victim.&quot;

As of 2024, Donald Trump has refused to apologize and retract his statements despite the exoneration of the men.

====== Lena Baker ======
Lena Baker was a Black woman who was wrongfully convicted of the murder of her abuser in 1945. In Georgia, Baker served as a maid for a handicapped white man; she faced regular sexual and physical abuse from him. Despite the town terrorizing Baker to leave the relationship, her abuser would equally threaten her with violence if she ever left. Weeks before his death, he started holding Baker prisoner in his gristmill for numerous days. Baker was able to escape the mill, but when she came back, her abuser threatened her with an iron bar. After a struggle, Baker took ahold of his pistol and shot the man in self-defense.

The all-white, all-male jury did not empathize with Baker&#x27;s case of self-defense as a survivor of her slave-like conditions, including sexual and physical abuse. In less than a day, the jury found Baker guilty of capital murder, which happened to result in a mandatory death sentence in Georgia at the time. After failed appeals, reviews, and the abandonment of her legal representation, Lena Baker was executed by electrocution in 1945. About 60 years following Baker&#x27;s death, her family, with the help of the Prison and Jail Project, requested a posthumous pardon. Their efforts succeeded in 2005 when Baker was granted a full and unconditional pardon from the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles because there was a lack of evidence to demonstrate Baker&#x27;s intent to kill. If the justice system had been careful with the evidence, they would have noted Baker&#x27;s conviction did not qualify as capital murder and should have resulted in a sentence other than the death penalty.

===Between sexes===
As of May 20, 2021, the Death Penalty Information Center reports that there are 51 women on death row. 17 women have been executed since 1976, compared to 1,516 men during the same time period. 
Since 1608, 15,391 lawful executions are confirmed to have been carried out in jurisdictions of, or now of, the United States, of these, 575, or 3.6%, were women. Women account for death sentences, people on death row, and people whose executions are actually carried out. While always comparatively rare, women are significantly less likely to be executed in the modern era than in the past. Of the 16 women executed on the state level, most took place in either Texas (6), Oklahoma (3) or Florida (2) and were demographically, 25% (4) African-American and 75% (12) being White of any ethnicity. Historically, the states that have executed the most women are California, Texas and Florida, though unlike Texas and Florida, California has not executed a woman in the post-Furman era. The racial breakdown of women sentenced to death is 61% white, 21% black, 13% Latina, 3% Asian, and 2% American Indian.

==Methods==


Of the 27 states with the death penalty, 23 provide lethal injection either as the sole method of execution, or as the primary method applying by default (if available) when the convict does not select one.

The four other states include South Carolina, which provides electrocution as the primary method, while Louisiana, Mississippi and Missouri allow the department of corrections to select the method.

Several states continue to use the three-drug protocol for lethal injection: firstly an anesthetic, secondly pancuronium bromide, a paralytic, and finally potassium chloride to stop the heart. Eight states have used a single-drug protocol, instead using a single anesthetic.

While some state statutes specify the drugs required in executions, a majority does not.

Pressures from anti-death penalty activists have led to supply-chain disruptions of the chemicals used in lethal injections. Hospira, the only U.S. manufacturer of sodium thiopental, stopped making the drug in 2011, citing &quot;[Hospira] would have to prove that it wouldn’t be used in capital punishment.&quot; In 2016, it was reported that more than 20 U.S. and European drug manufacturers including Pfizer (the owner of Hospira) had taken steps to prevent their drugs from being used for lethal injections.

Since then, some states have used other anesthetics, such as pentobarbital, etomidate, or fast-acting benzodiazepines or sedatives like midazolam. In 2009, following the failed execution of Romell Broom, Ohio began using a one drug protocol of thiopental sodium intravenously for lethal injections, or an intramuscular injection of midazolam and hydromorphone if an IV site could not be established. 

Many states have since bought lethal injection drugs from foreign suppliers, and most states have made it a criminal offense to reveal the identities of drug suppliers or execution team members. In November 2015, California adopted regulations allowing the state to use its own public compounding pharmacies to make the chemicals.

Lethal injection was held to be a constitutional method of execution by the U.S. Supreme Court in three cases: &quot;Baze v. Rees&quot; (2008), &quot;Glossip v. Gross&quot; (2015), and &quot;Bucklew v. Precythe&quot; (2019).

===State-selected methods===
In the following states, the method is selected by the department of corrections among:
*Lethal injection and unspecified gas in Missouri
*Lethal injection, nitrogen hypoxia and electrocution in Louisiana
*Lethal injection, nitrogen hypoxia, electrocution and firing squad in Mississippi 

===Offender-selected methods===
In the following states, death row inmates with an execution warrant may choose to be executed by a way other than the state default-method:
*Nitrogen hypoxia in Alabama
*Unspecified gas in California 
*Electrocution in Alabama and Florida
*Lethal injection or firing squad in South Carolina
In four states an alternate method (firing squad in Utah, gas inhalation in Arizona, and electrocution in Arkansas, Kentucky and Tennessee) is possible only when the inmate was sentenced to death for crimes committed prior to a specified date (usually when the state switched from the earlier method to lethal injection).

The most recent executions by methods other than injection are as follows (all chosen by the inmate):
===Backup methods===
Depending on the state, the following alternative methods are statutorily provided in case lethal injection is either found unconstitutional by a court or unavailable for practical reasons:
* Nitrogen hypoxia in Alabama and Oklahoma
* Unspecified gas in California and Wyoming
* Electrocution in Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky, Oklahoma and Tennessee
* Firing squad in Idaho, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Utah
* Hanging in New Hampshire (where repeal of the death penalty in 2019 is not retroactive, and the state still has one death row inmate)
Several states including Oklahoma, Tennessee and Utah, have added back-up methods recently (or have expanded their application fields) in reaction to the shortage of lethal injection drugs.

Some states such as Alabama, Florida and Tennessee have a larger provision dealing with execution methods unavailability, requiring their state departments of corrections to use &quot;any constitutional method&quot; if both lethal injection and electrocution are found unconstitutional. This was designed to make unnecessary any further legislative intervention in that event, but the provision applies only to legal (not practical) infeasibility. 

Oklahoma became in 2015 the first state to have adopted the nitrogen option. After struggling for years to design a nitrogen execution protocol and to obtain a proper device for it, Oklahoma announced in February 2020 it abandoned the project after finding a new reliable source of lethal injection drugs and has since resumed executions.

In March 2018, Alabama became the third state (after Oklahoma and Mississippi), to authorize the use of nitrogen hypoxia as a method of execution, and became the first one to effectively use it on January 25, 2024, with the execution of Kenneth Eugene Smith at William C. Holman Correctional Facility.

===Federal executions===
The method of execution of federal prisoners for offenses under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 is that of the state in which the conviction took place. If the state has no death penalty, the judge must choose a state with the death penalty for carrying out the execution.

The federal government has a facility (at U.S. Penitentiary Terre Haute) and regulations only for executions by lethal injection, but the United States Code allows U.S. Marshals to use state facilities and employees for federal executions.

The method of execution for death sentences imposed by military courts is lethal injection, and the Bureau of Prisons agreed to let the U.S. Armed Forces use its civilian facility for that purpose.

==Execution attendance==
The last public execution in the U.S. was that of Roscoe Jackson in Galena, Missouri, on May 21, 1937.

It was the last execution in the nation at which the general public was permitted to attend without any legally imposed restrictions. &quot;Public execution&quot; is a legal phrase, defined by the laws of various states, and carried out pursuant to a court order. Similar to &quot;public record&quot; or &quot;public meeting&quot;, it means that anyone who wants to attend the execution may do so.

Around 1890, a political movement developed in the United States to mandate private executions. Several states enacted laws which required executions to be conducted within a &quot;wall&quot; or &quot;enclosure&quot;, or to &quot;exclude public view&quot;. Most state laws currently use such explicit wording to prohibit public executions, while others do so only implicitly by enumerating the only authorized witnesses.

All states allow news reporters to be execution witnesses for information of the general public, except Wyoming which allows only witnesses authorized by the condemned.
Several states also allow victims&#x27; families and relatives selected by the prisoner to watch executions. An hour or two before the execution, the condemned is offered religious services and to choose their last meal (except in Texas which abolished it in 2011).

The execution of Timothy McVeigh on June 11, 2001, was witnessed by over 200 people, most by closed-circuit television. Most were survivors, or relatives of victims of, the 1995 Oklahoma City Bombing, for which McVeigh had been sentenced to death.

==Public opinion==
Gallup, Inc. has monitored support for the death penalty in the United States since 1937. Gallup surveys documented a sharp increase in support for capital punishment between 1966 (42%) and 1994 (80%). In the late 1990s, support began to wane, falling to 53% in a 2024 telephone calls survey.

Pew Research polls have measured in 2020 support for the death penalty to be 65% when a panel responds to a self-administered online survey, and 52% when asked by live telephone interviewers. The gap between the two methods was wider for Democratic-leaning voters, with 32% of them approving capital punishment by phone and 49% online, compared to a difference of 74% versus 83% for Republican-leaning voters.

In 2021, Ipsos conducted a multinational online survey on capital punishment among 55 countries. It showed 67% of Americans favoring the death penalty, more than any European Union country, but lower than Japan and South Korea.

Support levels vary depending on the questions wording. When asked in 2019 by Gallup to choose between the following two approaches, which do they think is the better penalty for murder, 36% of polled persons selected the death penalty, and 60% life imprisonment with absolutely no possibility of parole. This was the highest percentage received by life without parole since the first time the question was asked in 1985.

A 2019 study for the Rose Institute of State and Local Government surveyed respondents online about specific crimes. The two receiving the highest support for a capital sentence were raping and murdering a child (80%) and killing dozens of people as part of a terrorist attack (75%). The two that received the lowest support were killing someone after breaking into their home (52%) and killing someone in the course of a robbery (49%).

==Debate==
Amnesty International opposes capital punishment because it breaches human rights, in particular the right to life and the right to live free from torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Other groups oppose capital punishment on moral grounds.

Some law enforcement organizations, and some victims&#x27; rights groups support capital punishment.

The United States is one of the four developed countries that still practice capital punishment, along with Japan, Singapore, and Taiwan.

Religious groups are widely split on the issue of capital punishment. The Fiqh Council of North America, a group of Muslim scholars in the United States, has issued a fatwa calling for a moratorium on capital punishment in the United States until various preconditions in the legal system are met.

Reform Judaism has formally opposed the death penalty since 1959, when the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (now the Union for Reform Judaism) resolved &quot;that in the light of modern scientific knowledge and concepts of humanity, the resort to or continuation of capital punishment either by a state or by the national government is no longer morally justifiable.&quot; The resolution goes on to say that the death penalty &quot;lies as a stain upon civilization and our religious conscience.&quot; In 1979, the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the professional arm of the Reform rabbinate, resolved that, &quot;both in concept and in practice, Jewish tradition found capital punishment repugnant&quot; and there is no persuasive evidence &quot;that capital punishment serves as a deterrent to crime.&quot;

In October 2009, the American Law Institute voted to disavow the framework for capital punishment that it had created in 1962, as part of the Model Penal Code, &quot;in light of the current intractable institutional and structural obstacles to ensuring a minimally adequate system for administering capital punishment&quot;. A study commissioned by the institute had said that experience had proved that the goal of individualized decisions about who should be executed and the goal of systemic fairness for minorities and others could not be reconciled. , 159 prisoners have been exonerated due to evidence of their innocence.

Advocates of the death penalty say that it deters crime, is a good tool for prosecutors in plea bargaining, improves the community by eliminating recidivism by executed criminals, provides &quot;closure&quot; to surviving victims or loved ones, and is a just penalty. Some advocates against the death penalty argue that &quot;most of the rest of the world gave up on human sacrifice a long time ago.&quot;

The murder rate is highest in the South (6.5 per 100,000 in 2016), where 80% of executions are carried out, and lowest in the Northeast (3.5 per 100,000), with less than 1% of executions. A report by the US National Research Council in 2012 stated that studies claiming a deterrent effect are &quot;fundamentally flawed&quot; and should not be used for policy decisions. According to a survey of the former and present presidents of the country&#x27;s top academic criminological societies, 88% of these experts rejected the notion that the death penalty acts as a deterrent to murder.

Data shows that the application of the death penalty is strongly influenced by racial bias. In &quot;McCleskey v. Kemp&quot;, the United States supreme court acknowledged a &quot;racially disproportionate impact&quot; of capital punishment, but ultimately ruled that this was not enough to mitigate specific death penalty verdicts. Another argument in the capital punishment debate is the cost.

Opponents to the death penalty note that the lethal injection, the most common method of carrying out the death penalty, can oftentimes cause executed individuals to remain conscious for several minutes after administering the injection, causing them to feel severe pain in their veins. The &quot;three drug cocktail&quot; consists of midazolam, a sedative, vecuronium bromide, a paralytic, and potassium chloride, which stops the heart. Opponents note that the midazolam in particular may mask the executed individual&#x27;s pain and suffering. Opponents argue that this causes unnecessary pain and suffering on the executed individual and constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

Additionally, in 2021–22, states such as South Carolina have experienced a shortage of the drugs used to make the lethal cocktail and some inmates have had to choose between death by electric chair or death by firing squad (aiming for the heart). Critics note that these other methods are more likely to induce pain in the inmate during execution and that these methods of execution have a high risk of being botched.

=== Botched executions ===

One of the main arguments against the use of capital punishment in the United States is that there has been a long history of botched executions. University of Colorado Boulder Professor Michael L. Radelet described a &quot;botched execution&quot; as an execution that causes the prisoner to suffer for a long period of time before they die. This has led to the argument that capital punishment is cruel and unusual punishment. The following is a short list of examples of botched executions that have occurred in the United States.
* William Kemmler was the first person executed in the electric chair, in 1890. After being pronounced dead after 17 seconds, he was found to be still alive. The current was applied a second time, for two minutes, to complete the death.
* In Arizona, it took Joseph Wood two hours to die after being injected.
* In Alabama, the execution of Doyle Hamm was called off after prison medical staff spent nearly three hours attempting to insert an IV that could be used to administer the lethal injection drugs. In the process, the execution team punctured Hamm&#x27;s bladder and femoral artery, causing significant bleeding.
* In Florida, Jesse Joseph Tafero had flames burst from his hair during an electrocution.
* Wallace Wilkerson died after 27 minutes in pain after the firing squad failed to shoot him in the heart. Because of this, the constitutionality of the use of the firing squad was questioned. The Supreme Court of the United States affirmed that the firing squad did not violate the Eighth Amendment in the case &quot;Wilkerson v. Utah&quot; (1879).
* In New Mexico, Thomas Ketchum was decapitated when his body fell through the trap door during his hanging.
* In Mississippi, Jimmy Lee Gray died after being in the gas chamber for nine minutes. During the procedure, Gray thrashed and banged his head against the metal pole behind his head while struggling to breathe.

Austin Sarat, a professor of jurisprudence and political science at Amherst College, in his book &quot;Gruesome Spectacles: Botched Executions and America&#x27;s Death Penalty&quot;, found that from 1890 to 2010, 276 executions were botched out of a total of 8,776, or 3.15%, with lethal injections having the highest rate. Sarat writes that between 1980 and 2010 the rate of botched executions was higher than ever: 8.53 percent. Death penalty experts found that 36.8% of all executions attempted or completed in 2022 (all lethal injections) were botched.

==Clemency and commutations==
In states with the death penalty, the governor usually has the discretionary power to commute a death sentence or to stay its execution. In some states the governor is required to receive an advisory or binding recommendation from a separate board. In a few states like Georgia, the board decides alone on clemency. At the federal level, the power of clemency belongs to the President of the United States.

The largest number of clemencies was granted in January 2003 in Illinois when outgoing Governor George Ryan, who had already imposed a moratorium on executions, pardoned four death-row inmates and commuted the sentences of the remaining 167 to life in prison without the possibility of parole. When Governor Pat Quinn signed legislation abolishing the death penalty in Illinois in March 2011, he commuted the sentences of the fifteen inmates on death row to life imprisonment.

Previous post-&quot;Furman&quot; mass clemencies took place in 1986 in New Mexico, when Governor Toney Anaya commuted all death sentences because of his personal opposition to the death penalty. In 1991, outgoing Ohio Governor Dick Celeste commuted the sentences of eight prisoners, among them all four women on the state&#x27;s death row. And during his two terms (1979–1987) as Florida&#x27;s governor, Bob Graham, although a strong death penalty supporter who had overseen the first post-&quot;Furman&quot; involuntary execution as well as 15 others, agreed to commute the sentences of six people on the grounds of doubts about guilt or disproportionality.

On December 14, 2022, outgoing Oregon governor Kate Brown commuted the death sentences of all 17 inmates on Oregon&#x27;s death row to life imprisonment without parole, citing the death penalty&#x27;s status as &quot;an irreversible punishment that does not allow for correction [...] and never has been administered fairly and equitably&quot; and calling it &quot;wasteful of taxpayer dollars&quot; while questioning its ability to function as a deterrence to crime. Governor Brown also ordered the dismantling of Oregon&#x27;s lethal injection chamber and death row. Prior, Oregon had an ongoing official moratorium set by prior governor John Kitzhaber in 2011 and had not carried out any executions since that of Harry Charles Moore in 1997; furthermore, in 2019, the Oregon State Senate amended the state&#x27;s death penalty statutes to significantly reduce the number of crimes that warranted the death penalty, thereby invalidating many of the state&#x27;s active death sentences. In 2021, David Ray Bartol&#x27;s death sentence was overturned on the grounds of it being a &quot;disproportionate punishment&quot; in violation of Oregon&#x27;s state constitution, which death penalty experts and abolitionist advocates said would provide the rationale for the eventual overturning of every other death sentence in Oregon. Brown is the third Oregon governor to commute every standing death sentence in the state, after Governor Robert D. Holmes, who commuted every death sentence passed during his tenure from 1957 to 1959, and Governor Mark Hatfield, who commuted every death sentence in the state after Oregon temporarily abolished the death penalty in accordance with a statewide vote in 1964.

==Moratoria and reviews on executions==
All executions were suspended through the country between September 2007 and April 2008. At that time, the United States Supreme Court was examining the constitutionality of lethal injection in &quot;Baze v. Rees&quot;. This was the longest period with no executions in the United States since 1982. The Supreme Court ultimately upheld this method in a 7–2 ruling.

In addition to the states that have no valid death penalty statute, the following 13 states and 2 jurisdictions either have an official moratorium on executions or have had no executions for more than ten years as of 2025:
Since 1976, four states have only executed condemned prisoners who voluntarily waived any further appeals: Pennsylvania has executed three inmates, Oregon two, Connecticut one, and New Mexico one. In the last state, Governor Toney Anaya commuted the sentences of all five condemned prisoners on death row in late 1986.

In California, United States District Judge Jeremy Fogel suspended all executions in the state on December 15, 2006, ruling that the implementation used in California was unconstitutional but that it could be fixed. California Governor Gavin Newsom declared an indefinite moratorium on March 13, 2019; he also ordered the closure and dismantling of the death chamber. In 2023, Governor Newsom ordered the relocation of death row inmates out of death row and to different prisons across the country &quot;to phase out the practice of segregating people on death row based solely on their sentence,&quot; although no inmates were offered commutations or re-sentencing hearings related to these developments. Relocated death row inmates who obtained jobs in prison would have 70 percent of their earnings sent to their victims&#x27; families.

The CDCR says the move allows the state &quot;to phase out the practice of segregating people on death row based solely on their sentence.&quot; No inmates will be re-sentenced and no death row commutations offered, officials say.

On November 25, 2009, the Kentucky Supreme Court affirmed a decision by the Franklin County Circuit Court suspending executions until the state adopts regulations for carrying out the penalty by lethal injection.

In November 2011, Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber announced a moratorium on executions in Oregon, canceling a planned execution and ordering a review of the death penalty system in the state.

On February 13, 2015, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf announced a moratorium on the death penalty. Wolf will issue a reprieve for every execution until a commission on capital punishment, which was established in 2011 by the Pennsylvania State Senate, produces a recommendation. The state had not executed anyone since Gary M. Heidnik in 1999.

On July 25, 2019, U.S. Attorney General William Barr announced that the federal government would resume executions using pentobarbital, rather than the three-drug cocktail previously used. Five convicted death row inmates were scheduled to be executed in December 2019 and January 2020. On November 20, 2019, U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan issued a preliminary injunction preventing the resumption of federal executions. Plaintiffs in the case argued that the use of pentobarbital may violate the Federal Death Penalty Act of 1994. The stay was lifted in June 2020 and four executions were rescheduled for July and August 2020. On July 14, 2020, Daniel Lewis Lee was executed. He became the first convict executed by the federal government since 2003. Overall, thirteen federal prisoners were executed during the presidency of Donald Trump between July 2020 and January 2021. The last convict executed was Dustin Higgs on January 16, 2021. On July 1, 2021, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland halted all federal executions pending review of the changes made under the Trump administration.

On January 20, 2025, Donald Trump issued Executive Order 14164 as one of many presidential orders he issued on the first day of his second term. It requests that the Attorney General, and thus the Department of Justice, pursue the death penalty in all federal cases whose severity makes its use appropriate. The order also requests that, whenever legal and appropriate, the Justice Department &quot;pursue Federal jurisdiction and seek the death penalty&quot; for the specific federal capital offenses of murder of a law enforcement officer as well as any capital crimes committed by illegal aliens in the US. On February 5, 2025, Attorney General Pam Bondi formally rescinded the Biden administration&#x27;s moratorium on the federal death penalty. Bondi also stated the Justice Department&#x27;s intention to strengthen the death penalty and seek to apply it whenever appropriate for a capital crime, and to assist states in the implementation of death sentences.

<text>Garmisch-Partenkirchen (; ) is an Alpine ski town in Bavaria, southern Germany. It is the seat of government of the district of Garmisch-Partenkirchen (abbreviated &quot;GAP&quot;), in the Oberbayern region, which borders Austria. Nearby is Germany&#x27;s highest mountain, Zugspitze, at above sea level.

The town is known as the site of the 1936 Winter Olympic Games, the first to include alpine skiing, and hosts a variety of winter sports competitions.

==History==
Garmisch (in the west) and Partenkirchen (in the east) were separate towns for many centuries, and still maintain quite separate identities.

Partenkirchen originated as the Roman town of &quot;Partanum&quot; on the trade route from Venice to Augsburg and is first mentioned in the year A.D. 15. Its main street, Ludwigsstrasse, follows the original Roman road.

Garmisch was first mentioned some 800 years later as &quot;Germaneskau&quot; (&quot;German District&quot;), suggesting that at some point a Teutonic tribe took up settlement in the western end of the valley.

During the late 13th century, the valley, as part of the County of Werdenfels, came under the rule of the prince-bishops of Freising and was to remain so until the mediatization of 1803. The area was governed by a prince-bishop&#x27;s representative known as a &quot;Pfleger&quot; (caretaker or warden) from Werdenfels Castle situated on a crag north of Garmisch.

The Europeans&#x27; arrival to America at the turn of the 16th century led to a boom in shipping and a sharp decline in overland trade, which plunged the region into a centuries-long economic depression. The valley floor was swampy and difficult to farm. Bears, wolves and lynxes were a constant threat to livestock. The population suffered from periodic epidemics, including several serious outbreaks of bubonic plague. Adverse fortunes from disease and crop failure occasionally led to a witch hunt. Most notable of these were the trials and executions of 1589–1596, in which 63 people — more than 10 per cent of the population at the time — were burned at the stake or garroted.

Werdenfels Castle, where the accused were held, tried and executed, became an object of superstitious terror and was abandoned in the 17th century. It was largely torn down in the 1750s and its stones were used to build the baroque &quot;Neue Kirche&quot; (New Church) on Marienplatz, which was completed in 1752. It replaced the nearby Gothic &quot;Alte Kirche&quot; (Old Church), parts of which predated Christianity and might have originally been a pagan temple. Used as a storehouse, armory and haybarn for many years, it has since been re-consecrated. Some of its medieval frescoes are still visible.

Garmisch and Partenkirchen remained separate until their respective mayors were forced by Adolf Hitler to combine the two market towns on 1 January 1935 in anticipation of the 1936 Winter Olympic Games. Today, the united town is casually (but incorrectly) referred to as Garmisch, much to the dismay of Partenkirchen&#x27;s residents. Most visitors will notice the slightly more modern feel of Garmisch while the fresco-filled, cobblestoned streets of Partenkirchen have a generally more historic appearance. Early mornings and late afternoons in pleasant weather often find local traffic stopped while the dairy cows are herded to and from the nearby mountain meadows.

During World War II, Garmisch-Partenkirchen was a major hospital centre for the German military.

==Climate==
Garmisch-Partenkirchen leans towards an oceanic climate, and its winters are colder than the rest of Bavaria. Due to its higher elevation, it is very close to the winters associated with continental climates; it has a relatively wet and snowy climate, with high precipitation year-round. As of 2013 the regions in the west and east of the town were cited as having highest numbers of thunderstorm days in Europe.

==Transport==

The town is served by the B 2 as a continuation of the A 95 motorway, which ends at Eschenlohe 16 km north of the town.

Garmisch-Partenkirchen station is on the Munich–Garmisch-Partenkirchen line and the Mittenwald Railway (Garmisch–Mittenwald–Innsbruck). Regional services run every hour to Munich Central Station (&quot;München Hauptbahnhof&quot;) and Mittenwald and every two hours to Innsbruck Central Station (&quot;Innsbruck Hauptbahnhof&quot;) and Reutte. In addition there are special seasonal long-distance services, including ICEs, to Berlin, Hamburg, Dortmund, Bremen and Innsbruck.

It is the terminus of the Außerfern Railway to Reutte in Tirol / Kempten im Allgäu and the Bavarian Zugspitze Railway (with sections of rack railway) to the Zugspitze, the highest mountain in Germany.

There are several accessible high and low-level hiking trails from the town that have especially good views.

==Sports==
Garmisch-Partenkirchen is a favoured holiday spot for skiing, snowboarding, and hiking, having some of the best skiing areas (Garmisch Classic and Zugspitze) in Germany.

It was the site of the 1936 Winter Olympics, the first to feature alpine skiing. It later replaced Sapporo, Japan as the host of the 1940 Winter Olympics, but were cancelled due to World War II. Including the two cancelled cities in 1940, it is the only host city chosen during the World Wars that did not host a subsequent Olympics.

A variety of Nordic and alpine World Cup ski races are held here, usually on the Kandahar Track outside town. Traditionally, a ski jumping contest is held in Garmisch-Partenkirchen on New Year&#x27;s Day, as a part of the Four Hills Tournament (&quot;Vierschanzen-Tournee&quot;). The World Alpine Ski Championships were held in Garmisch in 1978 and 2011.

Garmisch-Partenkirchen was a partner in the city of Munich&#x27;s bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics but the IOC vote held on 6 July 2011 awarded the Games to Pyeongchang. The Winter Olympics were last held in the German-speaking Alps in 1976 in nearby Innsbruck, Austria.

In team sports, the professional former 10-time German champion ice hockey team SC Riessersee play at the Garmisch Olympia Stadium.

The local association football team is 1.FC Garmisch-Partenkirchen.

The George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies is also located in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. The Marshall Center is an internationally funded and mostly U.S.-staffed learning and conference centre for governments from around the world, but primarily from the former Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. It was established in June 1993, replacing the U.S. Army Russian Institute. Near the Marshall Center is the American Armed Forces Recreation Centers (Edelweiss Lodge and Resort) in Garmisch that serves U.S. and NATO military and their families. A number of U.S. troops and civilians are stationed in the town to provide logistical support to the Marshall Center and Edelweiss Recreation Center. The German Centre for Pediatric and Adolescent Rheumatology, the largest specialized centre for the treatment of children and adolescents with rheumatic diseases in Europe, has been active in Garmisch-Partenkirchen since 1952.

==Points of interest==
South of Partenkirchen is the Partnach Gorge, where the Partnach river surges spectacularly through a narrow, gap between high limestone cliffs. The Zugspitze (local name &quot;Zugspitz&quot;) is south of Garmisch near the village of Grainau. The highest mountain in Germany, it actually straddles the border with Austria. Also overlooking Garmisch-Partenkirchen is Germany&#x27;s fourth-highest mountain, the Leutasch Dreitorspitze (&quot;Three-Gate Peak&quot;, a name derived from its triple summit).

The King&#x27;s House on Schachen, a small castle built for Ludwig II of Bavaria, is also located in the mountains south of Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Its grounds contain the Alpengarten auf dem Schachen, an alpine botanical garden.

<text>USS &quot;Sealion&quot; (SS-195), a &quot;Sargo&quot;-class submarine, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the sea lion, any of several large, eared seals native to the Pacific.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Sealion&quot;′s keel was laid down on 20 June 1938 by the Electric Boat Company of Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 25 May 1939, sponsored by Mrs. Augusta K. Bloch, wife of Admiral Claude C. Bloch, Commander-in-Chief, United States Fleet, and commissioned on 27 November 1939, LT Julian K. Morrison, Jr. in command.

==Service history==
Following shakedown, &quot;Sealion&quot;, assigned to Submarine Division 17 (SubDiv 17), prepared for overseas deployment. On February 10, 1940 &quot;Sealion&quot; was conducting a port visit in St. Petersburg, Florida. That evening the commanding officer, LT J.K. Morrison Jr., was in the wardroom when he was accidentally shot in the upper abdomen by a target pistol he was cleaning. He was immediately transported to the hospital, but died of his injuries the next day. LCDR Richard Voge assumed command. In the spring of 1940, she sailed, with her division for the Philippine Islands, arriving at Cavite in the fall to commence operations as a unit of the Asiatic Fleet. Into October 1941, she ranged from Luzon into the Sulu Archipelago, then, with her sister ship &quot;Seadragon&quot;, another submarine in SubDiv 202, she prepared for a regular overhaul at the Cavite Navy Yard. By 8 December, her yard period had begun; and, two days later, she took two direct hits in the Japanese air raid which demolished the navy yard.

The first bomb struck the aft end of her conning tower fairwater and detonated outside the hull, destroying the main air induction valved and ventilation intake valve. This blast sent shrapnel flying in all directions, some of which struck the &quot;Seadragon&quot; alongside, killing ENS Samuel H. Hunter, Jr. The second bomb struck topside above the aft engine room, penetrating the hull and detonating inside. Four crewmen, working on the electrical controls and the motors for the overhaul, were killed instantly, Sterling Cecil Foster, Melvin Donald O&#x27;Connell, Ernest Ephrom Ogilvie, and Vallentyne Lester Paul.

&quot;Sealion&quot; flooded immediately and settled down by the stern with 40% of her main deck underwater and a 15-degree list to starboard. The destruction of the navy yard made repairs impossible, and she was ordered destroyed. All salvageable equipment was taken off, depth charges were placed inside, and on 25 December, the explosives were set off to prevent her from being made useful to the enemy.

Some of the crew were redistributed to other submarines of the Asiatic Fleet, with Voge taking command of the USS Sailfish (SS-192). Some of the crew were assigned to naval defense regiments being formed from other stranded sailors. They supplemented the Army forces defending the islands. Two &quot;Sealion&quot; men, MM 1c Howard Firth and SN 1c Harold Gearhart were subsequently captured by the Japanese and died as POW&#x27;s.

The wrecked &quot;Sealion&quot; remained were she sank, just off Machina Wharf in shallow water at the Cavite Navy Yard. When the Japanese occupied Manila and Cavite on 03 January 1942, they found the wreck where the USN had left her. They examined the wrecked boat to determine if anything was useful. Then, needing the valuable Machina Wharf for their own use, they raised the sub and moved it across Canacao Bay to a spot just off Sangley Point, dropping it in shallow water. It sat there with upper portions exposed, for the rest of the war and into the post-war period.

In 1959 the U.S. and Filipino forces wanted to expand the docking facilities at Sangley Point but found the &quot;Sealion&quot;&#x27;s wreck in the way. A salvage effort was started, but it was found that the remains of the four men who had died in the engine room during the original attack were still entombed there. The remains were carefully removed under military protocol with two returned to the U.S. for burial by their families. The other two received a full military honors burial at sea. Upon the completion of the salvage work, the wreck was likely sold for scrap.

==Successor==
Eli Thomas Reich, who was executive officer and engineer on &quot;Sealion&quot; when it was sunk, assumed command of the second in March 1944. Four of the six torpedoes that &quot;Sealion II&quot; fired to sink the carried the names Foster, O&#x27;Connell, Paul and Ogilvie—the men who had been killed in the bombing of the first &quot;Sealion&quot; three years earlier.

==In popular culture==
The sinking of &quot;Sealion&quot; was incorporated into the plot of the 1959 Cary Grant film &quot;Operation Petticoat&quot;, where the fictional submarine &quot;Sea Tiger&quot;, also based at Cavite, suffers a similar fate, although in the film she is re-floated and ordered to Cebu for a complete refit, thereby setting the stage for the film&#x27;s storyline.

In a graphic short story in &quot;El Alamein no Shinden&quot;, by Japanese manga artist Yukinobu Hoshino, &quot;Sealion&quot; stops the German invasion of England, Operation Sealion, after Germans fire on her by accident while the United States was still a neutral country.

<doc id="412449" wikidata="Q295225" url="?curid=412449" title="Cyrus I">
<text>Cyrus I (Old Persian: &quot;Kuruš&quot;) or Cyrus I of Anshan or Cyrus I of Persia, was King of Anshan in Persia from to 580 BC or, according to others, from to 600 BC. Cyrus I of Anshan is the grandfather of Cyrus the Great, also known as Cyrus II. His name in Modern Persian is کوروش, &quot;Kūroš&quot;, while in Greek he was called Κῦρος, &quot;Kȳros&quot;.

==Life==

Cyrus was an early member of the Achaemenid dynasty. He was apparently a grandson of its founder Achaemenes and son of Teispes, king of Anshan. Teispes&#x27; sons reportedly divided the kingdom between them after his death. Cyrus reigned as king of Anshan while his brother Ariaramnes was king of Parsa.

The chronological placement of this event is uncertain. This is due to his suggested, but still debated identification, with the monarch known as &quot;Kuraš of Parsumaš&quot;. Kuraš is first mentioned . In that year Shamash-shum-ukin, king of Babylon (668–648 BC), revolted against his older brother and overlord Ashurbanipal, king of Assyria (668–627 BC). Cyrus is mentioned being in a military alliance with the former. The war between the two brothers ended in 648 BC with the defeat and reported suicide of Shamash-shum-ukin.

Cyrus is mentioned again in 639 BC. At that year Ashurbanipal managed to defeat Elam and became overlord to several of its former allies. Kuraš was apparently among them. His elder son Arukku (&lt; *Ariy-uka) was reportedly sent to Assyria to pay tribute to its King. Kuraš then seems to vanish from the historical record. His suggested identification with Cyrus would help connect the Achaemenid dynasty to the major events of the 7th century BC.

Ashurbanipal died in 627 BC. Cyrus presumably continued paying tribute to his sons and successors Ashur-etil-ilani (627–623 BC) and Sin-shar-ishkun (623–612 BC). They were both opposed by an alliance led by Cyaxares of Media (633–584 BC) and Nabopolassar of Babylon (626–605 BC). In 612 BC the two managed to capture the Assyrian capital Nineveh. This was effectively the end of the Neo-Assyrian Empire though remnants of the Assyrian Army under Ashur-uballit II (612–609 BC) continued to resist from Harran.

Media and Babylon soon shared the lands previously controlled by the Assyrians. Anshan apparently fell under the control of the former. Cyrus is considered to have ended his days under the overlordship of either Cyaxares or his son Astyages (584–550 BC). Cyrus was succeeded by his son Cambyses I. His grandson would come to be known as Cyrus the Great, founder of the Persian Empire.

It has been noted that this account of his life and reign would place his early activities more than a century before those of his grandson. This would place his fathering of Cambyses very late in life and his death at an advanced age. It has been argued that Kuraš and Cyrus were separate figures of uncertain relation to each other. The latter would have then reigned in the early 6th century BC and his reign would seem rather uneventful. Due to the current lack of sufficient records for this historical period it remains uncertain which theory is closer to the facts.

It has been suggested by Louis Vandenberg that the Gur-e-Dokhtar is the tomb of Cyrus I. This is because all Achaemenid kings after Darius the Great were buried in rock-cut tombs, and because a similar building has been attributed to Cyrus the Great, it seemed logical to assume that a tomb like this must have been erected prior to the reign of Cyrus. However, other experts have claimed that it is the burial place of Mandane, mother of Cyrus the Great, while other scholars claim that the Gur-e-Dokhtar was the mausoleum of Atossa, the daughter of Cyrus the Great and the wife and queen of Darius the Great. Later, when the iron clamps were studied, it became clear that this building was erected in the 5th century BC, so it may have been for prince Cyrus the Younger.

<text>James Leroy Bottomley (April 23, 1900 – December 11, 1959) was an American professional baseball first baseman, scout and manager. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a first baseman from 1922 to 1937, most prominently as a member of the St. Louis Cardinals where he helped lead the team to four National League pennants and two World Series titles. 

Born in Oglesby, Illinois, Bottomley grew up in Nokomis, Illinois. He dropped out of high school at the age of 16 to raise money for his family. While he was playing semi-professional baseball, the Cardinals scouted and signed Bottomley before the season. He became an integral member of the Cardinals batting order, driving in 100 or more runs batted in between 1924 and 1929 as the team&#x27;s cleanup hitter. In , he established a major league record for driving in 12 runs in a nine inning game. 

In he led the National League (NL) in runs batted in and total bases, helping the Cardinals win their first World Series championship. Bottomley was named the NL&#x27;s Most Valuable Player in after leading the league in home runs, runs batted in and total bases. He won another World Series with the Cardinals in . Bottomley hit above .300 nine times and had accumulated a .310 career batting average by the end of his sixteen-year major league career. He also played for the Cincinnati Reds and St. Louis Browns and also served as player-manager for the Browns in 1937. 

After finishing his playing career with the Browns, Bottomley joined the Chicago Cubs organization as a scout and minor league baseball manager. After suffering a heart attack, Bottomley retired to raise cattle with his wife in Missouri. Bottomley was nicknamed &quot;Sunny Jim&quot; because of his cheerful disposition. Bottomley was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1974 by the Veterans Committee and to the Cardinals Hall of Fame in 2014.

==Early life==
Bottomley was born on April 23, 1900, to Elizabeth (née Carter) and John Bottomley in Oglesby, Illinois. His family later moved to Nokomis, Illinois, where Bottomley enrolled in grade school and Nokomis High School. He dropped out when he was 16 years old in order to help support his family financially. Bottomley worked as a coal miner, truck driver, grocery clerk, and railroad clerk. His younger brother, Ralph, died in a mining accident in 1920.

Bottomley also played semi-professional baseball for several local teams to make additional money, earning $5 a game ($ in current dollar terms). A police officer who knew Branch Rickey, the general manager of the St. Louis Cardinals, saw Bottomley play, and recommended Bottomley to Rickey.

==Professional career==

===St. Louis Cardinals===
Rickey dispatched scout Charley Barrett to investigate Bottomley. The Cardinals decided to invite Bottomley to a tryout in late 1919, and signed him to a $150-a-month ($ in current dollar terms) contract. Bottomley began his professional career in minor league baseball in 1920. That year, Bottomley played for the Mitchell Kernels of the Class-D South Dakota League, posting a .312 batting average in 97 games, as Barrett continued to scout him. He also played six games for the Sioux City Packers of the Class-A Western League. During his time in the minor leagues, the media began to call Bottomley &quot;Sunny Jim&quot;, due to his pleasant disposition.

The next season, Bottomley played for the Houston Buffaloes of the Class-A Texas League. Bottomley suffered a leg injury early in the season which became infected, and impeded his performance during the season. Bottomley managed only a .227 batting average in 130 games and struggled with his fielding. Unable to sell Bottomley after the season to Houston for $1,200 ($ in current dollar terms), Rickey sold Bottomley to the Syracuse Chiefs of the Class-AA International League for $1,000 ($ in current dollar terms). Fully recovered from his leg injury in 1922, Bottomley batted .348 with 14 home runs, 15 triples, and a .567 slugging percentage for the Chiefs. After the season, the Cardinals purchased Bottomley from the Chiefs for $15,000 ($ in current dollar terms).

Bottomley made his Major League Baseball debut for the St. Louis Cardinals on August 18, 1922. Replacing Jack Fournier, Bottomley batted .325 in 37 games. The Cardinals named Bottomley their starting first baseman in 1923. As a rookie, Bottomley batted .371, finishing second in the National League (NL) behind teammate Rogers Hornsby, who batted .384. His .425 on-base percentage also finished second in the NL behind Hornsby, while he finished sixth in slugging percentage, with a .535 mark. His 94 runs batted in (RBIs) were tenth-best in the league.

Bottomley posted a .316 batting average in 1924. In a game against the Brooklyn Dodgers on September 16, 1924, Bottomley set the major league record for RBIs in a single game, with 12, breaking Wilbert Robinson&#x27;s record of 11, set in 1892. Robinson was serving as the manager of the Dodgers at the time. (Bottomley had two home runs, a double and three singles as he went 6-for-6 at the plate.) This mark has since been tied by Mark Whiten in 1993. As he finished the season with 111 RBIs, placing third in the NL, Bottomley&#x27;s 14 home runs were seventh-best in the NL, while his .500 slugging percentage was good for tenth. On August 29, Bottomley became the last left-handed player to record an assist while playing second base.

Bottomley hit .367 in 1925, finishing second in the NL to Hornsby. He led the NL with 227 hits, while his 128 RBIs were third-best, and his .413 on-base percentage was seventh-best in the league. Bottomley batted .298 during the 1926 season, with an NL-leading 120 RBIs. His 19 home runs placed second in the NL, behind Hack Wilson&#x27;s 21, while his .506 slugging percentage was sixth-best. He batted .345 in the 1926 World Series, as the Cardinals defeated the New York Yankees.

In 1927, Bottomley finished the season with 124 RBIs, fourth best in the league, and a .509 slugging percentage, finishing sixth in the NL. Bottomley hit .325 with 31 home runs and 136 RBIs in 1928, leading the league in home runs and RBIs. He also became the second Major League player in history to join the 20–20–20 club, and became the first (since achieved by Jimmy Rollins in 2007) to record a 30 double, 20 triple, 30 home run season. That year, he won the League Award, given to the most valuable player of the NL. The Cardinals reached the 1928 World Series, and Bottomley batted .214 as they lost to the New York Yankees.

In 1929, Bottomley hit 29 home runs, finishing seventh in the NL, while his 137 RBIs were fifth-best, and his .568 slugging percentage placed him in eighth. After having what manager Gabby Street considered a &quot;poor year&quot; in 1930, Bottomley struggled in the 1930 World Series, batting .045 in 22 at-bats, as the Cardinals lost to the Philadelphia Athletics. Following the series, Bottomley described his World Series performance as &quot;a bust as far as hitting goes&quot;.

Amid questions about Bottomley&#x27;s status with the Cardinals heading into the 1931 season, he demonstrated renewed hitting ability during spring training. Despite the presence of Ripper Collins, a superior fielder who transferred to the Cardinals from the Rochester Red Wings of the International League, Street announced that Bottomley would remain the starting first baseman. However, Bottomley suffered an injury and struggled early in the 1931 season after returning to the game, and it appeared that he might lose his job to Collins, who filled in for Bottomley during his injury. Bottomley returned to form after his return, and he finished the season with a .3482 batting average, placing third behind teammate Chick Hafey&#x27;s .3489 and Bill Terry&#x27;s .3486, the closest batting average finish in MLB history. His .534 slugging percentage was the sixth best in the league. The Cardinals reached the 1931 World Series, with Bottomley batting .160, as the Cardinals defeated the Athletics. That offseason, other teams began to attempt to trade for either Bottomley or Collins. Bottomley batted .296 in 1932, though he played in only 91 games.

===Cincinnati Reds===
After the 1932 season, the Cardinals traded Bottomley to the Cincinnati Reds for Ownie Carroll and Estel Crabtree, in an attempt to partner Bottomley with Chick Hafey in developing a more potent offensive attack. Bottomley had also sought Cincinnati&#x27;s managerial position that offseason, which instead went to Donie Bush.

Bottomley threatened to quit baseball in a salary dispute with the Reds, as he attempted to negotiate a raise from his $8,000 salary ($ in current dollar terms), a reduction from the $13,000 salary ($ in current dollar terms) he earned with the Cardinals the previous year. He and the Reds eventually came to terms on a one-year contract believed to be worth between $10,000 and $13,000. Bottomley finished eighth in the NL with 83 RBIs in 1933, and ninth with 13 home runs. In three seasons with the Reds, Bottomley failed to hit higher than .283 or record more than 83 RBIs in a season. Bottomley left the Reds during spring training in 1935 due to a salary dispute, deciding to return to the team in April.

===St. Louis Browns===
Before the 1936 season, the Reds traded Bottomley to the St. Louis Browns of the American League (AL), who were managed by Hornsby, for Johnny Burnett. During a July road trip, Bottomley announced his retirement as a result of an injured back; however, he changed his mind and decided to remain with the team. Bottomley batted .298 for the 1936 season.

Bottomley decided to return to baseball in 1937. When the Browns struggled during the 1937 season, beginning the season with a 25–52 win–loss record, the Browns fired Hornsby and named Bottomley their player-manager. Bottomley led the Browns to 21 more victories, as the team finished the season in eighth place, with a 46–108 record. The Browns trailed the seventh place Athletics by games, and were 56 games out of first place. As a player, Bottomley batted .239 in 65 games during the 1937 season. Bottomley was among the ten oldest players in the AL that year.

The Browns did not retain Bottomley after the 1937 season, replacing him with Street, who served as his first assistant during the 1937 season. In 1938, Bottomley served as the player-manager of Syracuse. After a bad start to the season, and with team president Jack Corbett not adding capable players, Bottomley resigned and was replaced with Dick Porter. Bottomley also indicated that he did not want to continue playing.

===Career statistics===
In 1,991 games over 16 seasons, Bottomley posted a .310 batting average (2,313-for-7,471) with 1,177 runs, 465 doubles, 151 triples, 219 home runs, 1,422 RBI, 58 stolen bases, 664 bases on balls, .369 on-base percentage and .500 slugging percentage. Defensively, he recorded a .988 fielding percentage as a first baseman. In 24 World Series games over four Series, he batted just .200 (18-for-90) with one home run and 10 RBI.

==Managerial record==
==Personal life==
Bottomley married Elizabeth &quot;Betty&quot; Browner, who operated a St. Louis beauty parlor, on February 4, 1933. The couple had no children. After he retired from baseball in 1938, Bottomley and his wife moved to the Bourbon, Missouri, area, where he raised Hereford cattle. In 1939, Bottomley became a radio broadcaster, signing a deal with KWK, an AM broadcasting station, to broadcast Cardinals and Browns games.

Bottomley returned to baseball as a scout for the Cardinals in 1955. In 1957, he joined the Chicago Cubs as a scout and managed the Pulaski Cubs of the Class D Appalachian League. While managing in Pulaski, Bottomley suffered a heart attack. The Bottomleys moved to nearby Sullivan, Missouri. Bottomley died of a heart ailment in December 1959. He and his wife Betty were interred in the International Order of Odd Fellows Cemetery, Sullivan, Missouri.

==Honors==
Bottomley holds the single-season record for most unassisted double plays by a first baseman, with eight. Bottomley is also known as the only man to be sued for hitting a home run ball that hit a fan. The plaintiff was not looking. He had over 100 RBIs in each season from 1924 to 1929. Bottomley was the second player in baseball history to hit 20 or more doubles, triples, and home runs in one season (Frank Schulte being the first) and the first of two players (Lou Gehrig being the other) to collect 150 or more doubles, triples, and home runs in a career.

Bottomley was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame posthumously in 1974 by the Veterans Committee. The Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America charged that the Veterans Committee was not selective enough in choosing members. Charges of cronyism were levied against the Veterans Committee. When Bottomley was elected, the Veterans Committee included Frankie Frisch, a teammate of Bottomley&#x27;s with the Cardinals. Frisch and Bill Terry, also a member of the Veterans Committee at the time, shepherded the selections of teammates Jesse Haines in 1970, Dave Bancroft and Chick Hafey in 1971, Ross Youngs in 1972, George Kelly in 1973, and Freddie Lindstrom in 1976. This led to the Veterans Committee having its powers reduced in subsequent years.

In 2014, the Cardinals announced Bottomley was among 22 former players and personnel to be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for its inaugural class of 2014.

The city park in his adopted home town of Sullivan, Missouri is named for Bottomley. Also the park in his birthplace Oglesby, Illinois. A museum in Nokomis, Illinois, the Bottomley-Ruffing-Schalk Baseball Museum, is dedicated to Bottomley and fellow Hall of Famers Ray Schalk and Red Ruffing, who were also Nokomis residents.

<text>The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) is a progressive think tank based in London. It was founded in 1988 by Lord Hollick and Lord Eatwell, and is an independent registered charity. The think tank aims to maintain the momentum of progressive thought in the United Kingdom through well-researched and clearly argued policy analysis, reports, and publications; as well as a high media profile.

The IPPR has offices in Newcastle upon Tyne, Manchester, and Edinburgh. Funding comes from trust and foundation grants, government support, and individual donors.

==History==
The Institute for Public Policy Research was founded in 1988 by Lord Hollick and Lord Eatwell. The founding director was James Cornford, and Tessa Blackstone was the first chair. According to academic Peter Ruben its primary aim was to provide theoretical analysis for modernisers in the UK Labour Party; offering alternatives to free market fundamentalism.

In 1992 IPPR published the highly influential report of the Commission on Social Justice, laying out an ambitious agenda of social policy reform and revitalise progressive thinking as New Labour became ascendant.

IPPR North was launched in 2004 with an office opening in Newcastle upon Tyne; a second office was opened in Manchester in 2012.

Matthew Taylor was director between 1998 and 2003. Tom Kibasi was the group&#x27;s director between April 2016 and December 2019. Carys Roberts became Executive Director of IPPR in February 2020. Roberts&#x27;s role in shaping the IPPR&#x27;s leftward term led to the New Statesman naming her as the forty-sixth most powerful person in British left-wing politics.

== Publications ==
IPPR publishes about fifty reports each year, topics include economic policy, energy, transport, climate change, families, work, migration, integration, communities, democracy, devolution and public services.

===Journal===
The IPPR publishes the journal &quot;IPPR Progressive Review&quot; (formally &quot;Juncture&quot;) quarterly via Wiley.

===Reports===
In September 2018, the think tank published &quot;Prosperity and justice: A plan for the new economy - The final report of the IPPR Commission on Economic Justice&quot; based on two years of research. The report recommendations included; the minimum wage raised to £10.20 per hour in London and to £8.75 outside London, workers on zero hours contracts to be paid at least 20% above the higher rate, an industrial strategy boosting exports, with a new national investment bank raising £15bn a year to get public investment to 3.5% of GDP (the G7 average), large changes to government of UK companies including workers on company boards, raising the headline rate of corporation tax and a minimum corporation tax rate to fight tax avoidance by multinationals and a single income tax for all types of incomes. Currently the poorest 20% pay 35% of their incomes in tax, a higher proportion than any other income groups.

The IPPR published the &quot;State of the North 2019&quot; report, from IPPR North, which blames power centralisation and lack of devolution for adding to regional divisions. The report showed that the UK has larger regional divisions than any other country at a comparable level of economic development. The mortality rate in Blackpool, Hull and Manchester is higher than in some Turkish and Polish cities. Luke Raikes of the IPPR North, said, “It is no surprise that people across the country feel so disempowered. Both political and economic power are hoarded by a handful of people in London and the south-east and this has damaged all parts of the country, from Newcastle to Newham.” There are also bigger divides in job opportunities and productivity than in comparable nations. Areas in London and the South East rank among the most productive in the developed world, but areas in Northern Ireland, Wales and the North of England are less productive than areas in Hungary, Poland and Romania. The report authors maintain centralisation created and worsened these regional divisions and point out that 95p in every £1 paid in tax goes to Whitehall, compared with 69p in Germany. UK local government spends 1% of GDP on economic affairs while France and Germany spend twice as much locally and regionally. The UK is, “consistently more divided than any comparable country” over vital topics like productivity, income, unemployment, health and politics. Economists believe productivity is vital for economic growth and increasing living standards, there the UK is the most regionally divided nation of its size and development level and during the last decade has not improved. Regional inequality of income has increased over the years to 2019, reaching an average £48,000 per person difference between the most prosperous and the most deprived areas. Arianna Giovannini of IPPR North, said 2019 had, “exposed our country’s regional divides (...) But 2019 also showed the great promise of devolution. Mayors in the north have shown what’s possible, despite the limited amount of devolved power they currently have. Devolution must be the way forward for the country, and all areas need substantial power and funding. The next government must lead a devolution parliament – an unprecedented and irreversible shift of power – so that England’s regions, towns and cities can work together to bridge our regional divides.”

In October 2023, the IPPR said that the UK is “in reverse gear” in the global race for green growth, and that a lack of a green industrial strategy means Britain is lagging behind international competitors in exploiting the economic opportunities of the net-zero transition.

<doc id="412461" wikidata="Q7305359" url="?curid=412461" title="Red oil">
<text>Red oil is defined as a substance of varying composition formed when an organic solution, typically tri-n-butyl phosphate (TBP, an agent used for extracting heavy metals in nuclear reprocessing plants) and its diluent, comes in contact with concentrated nitric acid at a temperature above 120 °C.

Red oil is relatively stable below 130 °C, but it can decompose explosively when its temperature is
raised above 130 °C. Three red oil events have occurred in the United States: at the Hanford Site in 1953, and at the Savannah River Site (SRS) in 1953 and 1975. A red oil explosion also occurred in 1993 at the Tomsk-7 site at Seversk, Russia.

Generic types of equipment capable of producing red oil in the complex are categorized as evaporators, acid concentrators, and denitrators. The chemicals necessary to produce red oil are, at a minimum, TBP and nitric acid; other, contributory chemicals can include diluent (kerosene-like liquid used to dilute TBP) and/or aqueous phase metal nitrates.

Controls for prevention or mitigation of a red oil explosion are generally categorized as controls
for temperature, pressure, mass, and concentration. Maintaining a temperature of less than 130 °C is
generally accepted as a means to prevent red oil explosions. Sufficient venting serves to keep pressure from destroying the process vessel, while also providing the means for evaporative cooling to keep red oil from reaching the runaway temperature. Mass controls utilize decanters or hydrocyclones to remove organics from feedstreams entering process equipment capable of producing red oil. Limiting the total available TBP is another mass control that mitigates the consequence of a red oil explosion by limiting its maximum available explosive energy. Finally, concentration control can be utilized to keep the nitric acid below 10 M (moles/liter). A U.S. government study concluded that none of the controls should be used alone; rather, they should be used together to provide effective defense in depth for prevention of a red oil explosion.

==Ethylene==
Within the ethylene industry, &quot;Red oil&quot; is an organic contaminant frequently encountered in caustic towers. The &quot;red oil&quot; is an organic polymer that forms from the aldol condensation of acetaldehyde in sodium hydroxide solution. Initially, the acetaldehyde forms a light floating yellow oil. Quickly this will continue to polymerize into a more familiar orangish/red color – hence the term &quot;red oil&quot;. This red oil, particularly when aged, forms a more sticky heavy oil that is difficult to separate. This causes fouling and plugging issues in the caustic tower and downstream spent caustic handling systems, making red oil a contaminant that is closely monitored in the industry.

<doc id="412464" wikidata="Q7923572" url="?curid=412464" title="Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity">
<text>Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS) is a group of former officers of the United States Intelligence Community formed in January 2003. In February 2003, the group issued a statement accusing the Bush administration of misrepresenting U.S. national intelligence information in order to push the US and its allies toward that year&#x27;s US-led invasion of Iraq. The group issued a letter stating that intelligence analysts were not being heeded by policy makers. The group initially numbered 25, mostly retired analysts.

The group has later been implicated in support for Russian propaganda regarding the Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and support for the debunked conspiracy theory that Seth Rich and the DNC, not hacking by the Russians, was responsible for the leak of stolen DNC emails. There has also been speculation that VIPS, and in particular William Binney and Robert David Steele, may have been involved in recruiting the networks that became the QAnon pro-Trump conspiracy cult. Leonid Bershidsky wrote that in spite of favorable coverage in 2003, by 2017 VIPS was only promoted by &quot;non-mainstream publications that are easy to accuse of being channels for Russian disinformation&quot;.

==Founding members==
Members in 2004 included founder Ray McGovern, a former CIA analyst, as well as Patrick Eddington, Philip Giraldi, Larry C. Johnson, David MacMichael, Jesselyn Radack, Scott Ritter and others. Ray McGovern, a member of the VIPS steering committee, said VIPS had 35 members as of March 2004. A year earlier, the group had 25 members.

As of March 2024, the current members include, William Binney, Dick Black, Marshall Carter-Tripp, Bogdan Dzakovic, Graham E. Fuller, Philip Giraldi, Matthew Hoh, James George Jatras, Larry C. Johnson, John Kiriakou, Karen Kwiatkowski, Douglas Macgregor, Ray McGovern, Elizabeth Murray, Todd E. Pierce, Pedro Israel Orta, Scott Ritter, Coleen Rowley, Lawrence Wilkerson, Sarah G. Wilton, J. Kirk Wiebe, Robert Wing, and Ann Wright.

== Foundation: The Iraq war and the February 2003 memo ==
On February 7, 2003, on the eve of the Iraq War, VIPS released a &quot;Memorandum for The President&quot; criticizing U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell&#x27;s speech before the United Nations (UN), and warning against &quot;a war for which we see no compelling reason and from which we believe the unintended consequences are likely to be catastrophic&quot;:
VIPS followed up with ten further memos throughout 2003 and early 2004, &quot;assessing what the Bush administration knew about Iraq before, during, and after the war, and how that intelligence has been used–and misused&quot;.

In May 2003, &quot;The New York Times&quot; columnist Nicholas D. Kristof said that widespread outrage among intelligence professionals had led to the establishment of VIPS. After the CIA chief weapons inspector David Kay in 2004 announced no stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction could be found in Iraq, Michael W. Robbins opined in the magazine &quot;Mother Jones&quot; that VIPS &quot;produced some of the most credible, and critical, analyses of the Bush Administration&#x27;s handling of intelligence data in the run-up to the March 2003 invasion of Iraq&quot;.

== Israeli influence: The August 2010 memo ==
On August 3, 2010, VIPS publicly released another memorandum for the President claiming that the government of Israel has a record of deceiving the U.S. government and estimated that Israel would unilaterally attack Iran &quot;as early as this month&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harkov_8/5/2010&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The letter also alleges that the &quot;Likud Lobby&quot; has disproportionate influence on U.S. policy, giving the example of a visit to Israel by Senators John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Joseph Lieberman.
== Chemical weapons in Syria ==

After the Ghouta chemical attack in Syria, VIPS issued an &quot;open letter&quot; to President Barack Obama stating that &quot;former co-workers&quot; and &quot;numerous sources in the Middle East&quot; had informed them that Syrian government forces were not responsible for the attack, contrary to the position of the US government and foreign intelligence agencies. The letter stated that there was instead &quot;a strong circumstantial case&quot; that the incident was a &quot;pre-planned provocation by the Syrian opposition and its Saudi and Turkish supporters&quot;. The stated purpose of the letter was to urge President Obama against using the Ghouta incident to justify military action against the Syrian government because the signatories of the letter
Muhammad Idrees Ahmad, writing in &quot;The New Republic&quot;, commented on the take-up of the VIPS analysis by Michael Moore, &quot;WorldNetDaily&quot; and Pamela Geller. He also criticized the letter&#x27;s reliance on anonymous sources, noting that the cited sources for the &quot;most sensational claims&quot; were conspiracy theory outlets &quot;GlobalResearch&quot; and &quot;InfoWars&quot; as well as Yossef Bodansky and &quot;MintPress News&quot;.

In April 2017, VIPS wrote a memo to President Donald Trump warning of escalation in the war in Syria and alleging that the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack had not occurred but rather, citing &quot;Our U.S. Army contacts in the area,&quot; that &quot;a Syrian aircraft bombed an al-Qaeda-in-Syria ammunition depot that turned out to be full of noxious chemicals and a strong wind blew the chemical-laden cloud over a nearby village where many consequently died&quot;. Signatories included Scott Ritter. According to Al Jazeera, &quot;There is reason to doubt the existence of these “Army contacts.&quot;

A September 2017 statement signed by five VIPS members, in response to dissenters within VIPS, said &quot;in recent years we have seen “false-flag” attacks carried out to undergird a political narrative and objective—to blame the Syrian government for chemical attacks&quot;. The five members were William Binney, Skip Folden, Ed Loomis, Ray McGovern and Kirk Wiebe.

== Russiagate and the Trump presidency ==
===The DNC hack===

In December 2016, VIPS released a memorandum that defended Russia by criticizing allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections as &quot;evidence-free&quot;. The memorandum asserted that the 2016 Democratic National Committee email leak was the result of an internal leak and not a Russian hack.

On July 24, 2017, VIPS released another memorandum, co-authored by William Binney, who later admitted he had been fooled by a Russian &quot;fabrication&quot; by the entity &quot;Forensicator&quot;. The memorandum also argued that the DNC was not hacked, this time based on a forensic analysis conducted by the anonymous entity &quot;Forensicator&quot; with whom they communicated via retired IBM employee Skip Folden. This analysis was based on DNC files released by the Russian intelligence cutout Guccifer 2.0. The memo was released &quot;over the substantive objections of several VIPS members&quot;.

According to Patrick Lawrence&#x27;s article in &quot;The Nation&quot;, the memorandum argued that the metadata in these files were altered to add Russian fingerprints, and that file transfer rate proved they were transferred locally. Brian Feldman, writing in the &quot;New York&quot; magazine, criticized the report for relying on &quot;the &#x27;metadata&#x27; of &#x27;locked files&#x27; that only [Forensicator] had access to&quot; pointing out that these phrases were meaningless. Feldman described the claims in Patrick Lawrence&#x27;s article as &quot;too incoherent to even debunk&quot; and criticized its use of &quot;techno-gibberish&quot;. &quot;The Nation&#x27;s&quot; editor and publisher Katrina vanden Heuvel said she was &quot;appalled&quot; after Lawrence tweeted in support of the debunked conspiracy theory that Seth Rich was responsible for the leak. Vanden Heuvel said the story had nothing to do with Rich.

According to John Hultquist of FireEye:
The Guardian Project founder Nathaniel Freitas independently reviewed Lawrence&#x27;s article on behalf of &quot;The Nation&quot;, concluding that while &quot;the work of the Forensicator is detailed and accurate,&quot; it did not prove the conclusions VIPS and Lawrence derived from it. Freitas stated that the high throughput suggested by the relevant metadata could have been achieved by a hacker under several different scenarios, including through the use of a remote access trojan, and that the leak hypothesis also requires &quot;the target server ... to be physically on site in the building&quot;: &quot;If the files were stored remotely &#x27;in the cloud,&#x27; then the same criticism of &#x27;it is not possible to get those speeds&#x27; would come into play.&quot; In sum: &quot;At this point, given the limited available data, certainty about only a very small number of things can be achieved.&quot;

&quot;Forensicator&quot; subsequently said that VIPS made &quot;over-ambitious extrapolations&quot; from their own claims. Robert Dreyfuss, a contributing editor for &quot;The Nation&quot;, said Freitas&#x27; review showed that Lawrence&#x27;s article was &quot;flat-out wrong&quot; and should be fully retracted. Leonid Bershidsky, who was sympathetic to the VIPS allegations, wrote that, although VIPS had originally received favorable coverage in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2003, by 2017 they were only promoted by &quot;non-mainstream publications that are easy to accuse of being channels for Russian disinformation&quot;.

Some VIPS members, describing it as a &quot;problematic memo because of troubling questions about its conclusions&quot;, refused to sign the July memo, including Scott Ritter, Philip Giraldi, Jesselyn Radack and former NSA senior executive Thomas A. Drake. Drake said &quot;Ray [McGovern]&#x27;s determination to publish claims he wanted to believe without checking facts and discarding evidence he didn&#x27;t want to hear exactly reproduced the Iraq war intelligence failures which the VIPS group was formed to oppose.&quot;

The VIPS memos were promoted by &quot;Breitbart News&quot; and Fox News, leading Trump, who is known to get his news from those sources,&lt;ref name=&quot;McGraw_4/24/2024&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; to request Mike Pompeo to meet with VIPS&#x27;s William Binney.

Duncan Campbell of &quot;Computer Weekly&quot; investigated the claims and found that the documents on which VIPS relied were fake, and tracked their source to a pro-Russian Briton. After checking the source material, Binney conceded that the Forensicator material was indeed a &quot;fabrication&quot;.

===Gina Haspel and QAnon===
In March 2018, VIPS published a memo opposing the appointment of Gina Haspel as CIA director due to her alleged involvement in the CIA&#x27;s torture program.

The &quot;Financial Times&quot; and Heavy have speculated that VIPS, and in particular William Binney and Robert David Steele, may have been involved in recruiting the networks that became the QAnon pro-Trump conspiracy cult.

==Former and current members==
Two members, Bill and Kathleen Christison, resigned from the group in July 2003 following a VIPS open letter calling for the resignation of American Vice President Dick Cheney. In an open letter explaining their resignation, they said VIPS should write about policies and actions rather than personalities, and they wanted to avoid Cheney becoming a scapegoat which would end calls for further change to the Bush administration&#x27;s foreign policy. They also said the memo included statements that &quot;diminish VIPS&#x27; credibility and open it to charges of the very kind of truth-stretching that it is trying to combat&quot;. They said VIPS must be scrupulous since it is made up of &quot;retired intelligence officers without firsthand inside information&quot;.

<doc id="412473" wikidata="Q167414" url="?curid=412473" title="František Kupka">
<text>František Kupka (23 September 1871 – 24 June 1957), also known as &quot;Frank Kupka&quot; or &quot;François Kupka,&quot; was a Czech painter and graphic artist. He was a pioneer and co-founder of the early phases of the abstract art movement and Orphic Cubism (Orphism).
Kupka&#x27;s abstract works arose from a base of realism, but later evolved into pure abstract art.

==Biography==

===Education===
František Kupka was born in Opočno (eastern Bohemia) in Austria-Hungary in 1871. From 1889 to 1892, he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague. At this time, he painted historical and patriotic themes. Kupka enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, where he concentrated on symbolic and allegorical subjects. He was influenced by the painter and social reformer Karl Wilhelm Diefenbach (1851–1913) and his naturistic life-style. Kupka exhibited at the Kunstverein, Vienna, in 1894. His involvement with theosophy and Eastern philosophy dates from this period. By spring 1894, Kupka had settled in Paris; there he attended the Académie Julian briefly and then studied with Jean-Pierre Laurens at the École des Beaux-Arts.

===World War I===
Kupka served as a volunteer in the First World War, and is mentioned in &quot;La Main coupée&quot; by Blaise Cendrars.
Cendrars describes him as a &quot;proud soldier, calm, placid, strong&quot;, but really too old to be a soldier, being at least 25 years older than the rest. When the regiment set out from Paris for the front in Picardy (they marched all the way on foot) Mme Kupka met the column as they arrived at the La Défense roundabout, near where they lived. She marched with them, carrying her husband&#x27;s bag and his rifle. She would have marched all the way to the front, but at the end of the first day the colonel had her arrested and sent back to Paris. She later made her way to the front lines to spend time with her husband. Kupka himself left the front due to frostbite in the foot, caused by nights in the trenches waist-deep in freezing water.

===Career===

Kupka worked as an illustrator of books and posters and, during his early years in Paris, became known for his satirical drawings for newspapers and magazines. In 1906, he settled in Puteaux, a suburb of Paris, and the same year exhibited for the first time at the Salon d&#x27;Automne. Kupka was deeply impressed by the first Futurist Manifesto, published in 1909 in &quot;Le Figaro&quot;. Kupka&#x27;s 1909 painting &quot;Piano Keyboard/Lake&quot; marked a break in his representational style. His work became increasingly abstract around 1910–11, reflecting his theories of motion, color, and the relationship between music and painting (orphism). In 1911, he attended meetings of the Puteaux Group (Section d&#x27;Or). In 1912, he exhibited his &quot;Amorpha. Fugue à deux couleurs&quot;, at the Salon des Indépendants in the Cubist room, although he did not wish to be identified with any movement. &quot;Creation in the Plastic Arts&quot;, a book Kupka completed in 1913, was published in Prague in 1923.
In 1931, he was a founding member of Abstraction-Création. In 1936, his work was included in the exhibition &quot;Cubism and Abstract Art&quot; at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, and in an important show with another Czech painter, Alphonse Mucha, at the Jeu de Paume in Paris. A retrospective of his work took place at the Galerie Mánes in Prague in 1946. The same year, Kupka participated in the Salon des Réalités Nouvelles, where he continued to exhibit regularly until his death. During the early 1950s, he gained general recognition and had several solo shows in New York.

Between 1919 and 1938 Kupka was financially supported by his good friend, art collector and industrialist Jindřich Waldes who accumulated a substantial collection of his art. Kupka died in 1957 in Puteaux, France.

==Work==
Kupka had a strong interest in color theory and freeing colors from descriptive associations (which is thoughtby whom? to have possibly influenced other artists like Robert Delaunay). Margit Rowell described his painting &quot;The Yellow Scale&quot; (c. 1907) as &quot;Kupka&#x27;s first attempt to come to terms with color theory in which the result is both personal and successful&quot;. Although a self-portrait, the subject of the painting was the color yellow. Around 1910 he began developing his own color wheels, adapting a format previously explored by Sir Isaac Newton and Hermann von Helmholtz. This work in turn led Kupka to execute a series of paintings he called &quot;Discs of Newton&quot; (1911–12).

* &quot;Planes by Colors&quot;
* &quot;The Colored One&quot;
* &quot;Reminiscence of a Cathedral&quot;
* &quot;Blue Space&quot;

Works in Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Venice, Italy:
* &quot;Study for Woman Picking Flowers (Femme cueillant des fleurs)&quot;, ca 1910
* &quot;Study for Amorpha&quot;, &quot;Warm Chromatics&quot;, &quot;Chromatique chaude&quot; and for &quot;Fugue in Two Colors&quot; (Fugue a deux couleurs), ca 1911-1912
* &quot;Vertical Planes (Plans verticaux)&quot;, 1911–1912
* &quot;Study for Organization of Graphic Motifs I (Localisations de mobiles graphiques I)&quot;, ca 1911-12
* &quot;Around a point (Autour d&#x27;un point)&quot;, ca 1920–1925

Other works include &quot;The Cathedral (Katedrála)&quot;.

In March 2021, Kupka&#x27;s &quot;Le Jaillissement II&quot; sold for 7,551,600 in an auction organized by Sotheby&#x27;s, so far the highest price for his work.

==Personal life==
Kupka was a vegetarian and took interest in theosophy. He practiced as a spiritualist medium and was alleged to have experienced clairvoyant trances. He was a believer in thought-forms which influenced his artwork. His theosophic visions inspired his painting &quot;Disks of Newton (Study for &quot;Fugue in Two Colors&quot;)&quot;. He also practiced naturism.

<text>Distant Drums is a 1951 American Florida Western film directed by Raoul Walsh and starring Gary Cooper. It is set during the Second Seminole War in the 1840s, with Cooper playing an American Army captain who successfully destroys a fort held by Spanish gunrunners and is pursued into the Everglades by a large group of Seminoles. The fort used in the film was the historic Castillo de San Marcos in St. Augustine, Florida, and most of the principal photography was shot on location in Florida.

&quot;Distant Drums&quot; was criticized for being historically inaccurate, received mixed reviews upon release, and was a moderate financial success. It is notable for being the source of the Wilhelm scream sound effect, which is believed to have been voiced by cast member Sheb Wooley and is used when a supporting character is attacked by an alligator.

==Plot==

During the Second Seminole War in 1840, US Army General Zachary Taylor sends naval Lieutenant Tufts and scout Monk to a remote Florida island home, where the reclusive Captain Quincy Wyatt lives with his 5-year-old son. The soldiers&#x27; mission is to destroy a remote &quot;old Spanish fort&quot; being used as a base for Spanish gunrunners aiding the Seminoles, and they convince the reluctant Wyatt to lead the small strike force as Taylor had requested.

Wyatt and his men succeed in destroying the fort (the historic Castillo de San Marcos, which was not harmed during filming), but not before rescuing a group of prisoners being held there. One of them, Judy Beckett, develops romantic feelings towards Capt. Wyatt as they flee from a large group of pursuing Seminoles through the Everglades. The journey is perilous, and several of the troops are killed, including one who is attacked by an alligator and dragged under water. Wyatt leads the survivors to his remote homestead, where he is shocked to discover that his home has been burned and his son is missing. Meanwhile, the pursuing Seminoles arrive nearby, and Wyatt challenges their chief, Ocala, to single combat. Wyatt kills him in an underwater fight and the Seminoles flee. Soon after, he discovers that his son had been taken to safety before his home had been attacked and they are reunited.

<doc id="412476" wikidata="Q725946" url="?curid=412476" title="The Bodyguard (1992 film)">
<text>The Bodyguard is a 1992 American romantic thriller drama film directed by Mick Jackson, written by Lawrence Kasdan, and starring Kevin Costner, Whitney Houston (in her movie acting debut), Gary Kemp, Bill Cobbs, and Ralph Waite. The film follows a former United States Secret Service agent turned bodyguard who is hired to protect a famous actress and singer from an unknown stalker. Kasdan wrote the film in the mid-1970s, originally as a vehicle for Steve McQueen and Diana Ross.

&quot;The Bodyguard&quot; was theatrically released by Warner Bros. Pictures on November 25, 1992. The film grossed $411 million worldwide, becoming the second-highest-grossing film of 1992, but received generally mixed reviews from critics. The film&#x27;s accompanying soundtrack by Houston became the best-selling soundtrack album of all time, with sales of over 50 million copies worldwide, and won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, while the singles &quot;I Have Nothing&quot; and &quot;Run to You&quot; received nominations for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. The film received seven nominations at the 13th Golden Raspberry Awards, including for Worst Picture, Worst Actor (for Costner) and Worst Actress (for Houston). In spite of the Razzies, Houston received best acting nominations at the People&#x27;s Choice Awards, MTV Movie &amp; TV Awards and the NAACP Image Awards. &quot;Billboard&quot; later listed Houston&#x27;s performance in the film as the 27th best performance of a musician in a box-office film.

==Plot==
Rachel Marron, an Academy Award-nominated actress and music superstar, is being sent death threats by a stalker. After a bomb explodes in her dressing room, her manager Bill Devaney seeks out professional bodyguard Frank Farmer, a former Secret Service agent who served on the Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan presidential details, to protect her.

Frank reluctantly accepts Devaney&#x27;s offer, but he feels Rachel is a spoiled diva who is oblivious to the threats against her life. She soon accuses Frank of being paranoid, complaining that his extensive protection techniques are intrusive. However, he and Rachel grow closer when he rescues her from danger after a riot erupts at one of her concerts. Her existing bodyguard Tony resents Frank&#x27;s presence, leading to a brawl between the two in Rachel&#x27;s kitchen.

Though Frank tries to remain professional, he and Rachel sleep together; he breaks off the affair the next day, realizing it compromises his ability to protect her. Hurt, she begins to defy Frank&#x27;s security measures. Then, to make him jealous, Rachel flirts with his former Secret Service colleague, Greg Portman, whom she meets at a Miami party.

When her stalker places a threatening phone call to her, Rachel finally recognizes the seriousness of the situation and her need to trust Frank completely. Frank, Rachel, her son Fletcher, her older sister Nicki, and her driver, Henry, then travel to a large lakefront cabin in the mountains, the home of Frank&#x27;s father Herb.

The next day, Frank rescues Fletcher from a small motorboat just before it explodes. After he secures the house for the night, a drunken Nicki, upset that her nephew could have died, admits she had hired a hitman to kill Rachel during a fit of jealousy. However, the letters from the stalker had come before that. Nicki has already paid in full and does not know the killer&#x27;s identity.

Abruptly, the hitman breaks into the dark house and fatally shoots Nicki. Frank pursues the killer into the woods; he shoots at them, misses, and the assailant escapes. He then learns that the stalker had been apprehended earlier that day, and was in custody when Nicki was killed.

A few days after Nicki&#x27;s funeral is the Academy Awards ceremony, where Frank gives Rachel a panic button in the shape of a cross to immediately alert him to any trouble. Despite this, a plethora of backstage technical issues hamper Frank&#x27;s efforts to monitor the proceedings closely. While presenting an award, Rachel freezes and runs offstage, angry at Frank for embarrassing her with overprotective measures.

Later, Rachel is announced as the winner for Best Actress, but as she comes on stage to accept the award, Portman is revealed to be the hitman, masquerading as the bodyguard for the ceremony&#x27;s host. Frank notices Portman pointing a gun disguised as a camera at Rachel and preparing for the fatal shot. He runs onstage and leaps in front of Rachel and is wounded by the bullet meant for her. As chaos erupts amongst the audience, Portman targets Rachel again, only to be shot and killed by Frank. While Rachel urges Frank to remain conscious and calls for help, he slowly passes out.

Frank recovers from the shooting and bids farewell to Rachel at the airport, both knowing their relationship would never work out. After the plane starts to take off, Rachel suddenly orders the plane to stop, jumps out and runs to Frank for one last passionate kiss.

Some time later, Rachel performs &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; on a stage, while elsewhere Frank is at an annual dinner keeping a vigilant eye on his next assignment. A minister is seen holding a cross similar to the one he gave Rachel.

==Production==
Lawrence Kasdan was an advertising copywriter who wanted to get into filmmaking. He wrote eight scripts in eight years, including &quot;The Bodyguard&quot;, which Kasdan says was inspired by &quot;Yojimbo&quot; with Steve McQueen as the lead. &quot;I was interested in what kind of a guy would do that kind of work: to be willing to lay down his life for a salary, for someone he may care nothing about-maybe even have negative feelings about,&quot; said Kasdan. Kasdan says it was the first really good script he wrote:
I loved all my early scripts and I expected everybody else to love them. It wasn&#x27;t until I wrote &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; and sensed it was different that I realized I was writing an increased level of density. A good script has levels of action going on, unexpected turns. Movies are an economical form. Your script must communicate in the tersest possible way an emotional feeling, imply it in a mosaic of tiny scenes. An unknown screenwriter selling a speculative script must deliver a delight. An established writer gets a lot of rope. The producer reads his script and says, &#x27;I don&#x27;t feel any delight but he must know what he&#x27;s doing.&#x27; A lot of times he doesn&#x27;t, and you have a lousy movie.
Kasdan wrote it in 1975 and the script succeeded in getting him an agent, but it took the agent two years to sell the script—he says 67 people passed on it. Eventually, the script was sold to John Calley for $20,000. Calley brought in John Boorman to direct. Kasdan admired Boorman and went to Ireland with the director where they did a treatment for a new movie. &quot;He completely changed it, but I still loved him,&quot; said Kasdan.

In November 1978, the film was going ahead with Ryan O&#x27;Neal and Diana Ross. Then, Ross pulled out of the movie which went back into development hell.

Houston&#x27;s association with &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; dates to the mid-1980s when production was briefly explored again. According to the December 20, 1986 edition of &quot;Billboard Magazine,&quot; &quot;press reports indicate that Houston will make her film debut opposite Clint Eastwood in &quot;The Bodyguard&quot;.&quot;

After Kasdan made his successful directorial debut with &quot;Body Heat&quot;, he was asked to direct &quot;The Bodyguard&quot;, but he was reluctant, preferring to make &quot;The Big Chill&quot;. Kevin Costner read the script when making &quot;Silverado&quot; with Kasdan and became enthusiastic about it. The two men decided to produce it together. After Costner became a major star with the success of &quot;The Untouchables&quot; and &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot;, among others, he had the clout to make &quot;The Bodyguard&quot;. In April 1991, Costner announced that he would star in the film alongside Whitney Houston.

Filming began in Los Angeles in November 1991, with other locations including Long Beach, California, Miami, Florida, and California&#x27;s Fallen Leaf Lake. For the climactic Academy Awards sequence, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences permitted the film to use the award name, but not any of the trophies themselves. On January 3, 1992, a fatal accident occurred on set in Downtown Los Angeles, when 33-year-old grip driver William Vitagliano was pinned between two cranes carrying lighting equipment, and died from his injuries at a nearby hospital. Legal action was later brought against the manufacturers of the lifts, which resulted in an out-of-court settlement.

Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 38% based on 50 reviews, with an average score of 5.2/10. Its critical consensus reads: &quot;&quot;The Bodyguard&quot; is a cheesy, melodramatic potboiler with occasional moments of electricity from Whitney Houston.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a score of 38 out of 100 based on reviews from 20 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of &quot;B+&quot; on scale of A+ to F.

Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote: &quot;To say that Houston and Costner fail to strike sparks would be putting it mildly.&quot; He added that &quot;the movie gives us these two self-contained celebrity icons working hard to look as if they want each other. It&#x27;s like watching two statues attempting to mate.&quot; Roger Ebert gave it three out of four stars and wrote: &quot;The movie does contain a love story, but it&#x27;s the kind of guarded passion that grows between two people who spend a lot of time keeping their priorities straight.&quot;

The film is listed in Golden Raspberry Award founder John Wilson&#x27;s &quot;The Official Razzie Movie Guide&quot; as one of The 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made.

===Box office===
In the United States and Canada, &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; opened on November 25, 1992 in 1,717 theaters; it grossed $16.6 million in its opening weekend, ranking third. The film spent 10 weeks in the Top 10, ultimately grossing $121.9 million domestically, and $410.9 million worldwide. Its international gross was a record for Warner Bros. In the United Kingdom, it had a record Christmas opening, with a gross of $2 million for the weekend from 258 screens. In Australia, it set an opening week record of $A4.36 million from 144 screens, beating the record set by &quot;Crocodile Dundee II&quot;. It also set the opening weekend record in Denmark. It was the highest-grossing Warner Bros. film in Japan of all-time with a gross in excess of $21 million. It was the seventh-highest-grossing film of 1992 in the United States and Canada and the second-highest-grossing film of 1992, worldwide, behind &quot;Aladdin&quot;, which curiously opened on the same day as &quot;The Bodyguard&quot;. At the time, it was the tenth-highest-grossing film of all time.

The film was re-released in 2012 and grossed a further $61,020.

===Accolades===

Two songs from the film, &quot;Run to You&quot; and &quot;I Have Nothing&quot;, were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song. The soundtrack was nominated for four Grammy Awards, winning three, including Album of the Year for its album of the same name. The film was nominated for several MTV Movie Awards, Image Awards, BMI Film &amp; TV Awards, a Golden Screen Award in Germany and a Japan Academy Film Prize.

It received seven Golden Raspberry Award nominations, including Worst Picture, Worst Actor (for Costner), and Worst Actress (for Houston). Houston was also nominated for Worst New Star as was Kevin Costner&#x27;s haircut, however the film did not win in any category.

In 2004, the American Film Institute ranked the film&#x27;s version of &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; as #65 on its AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs list.

==Music==
===Soundtrack===

&quot;The Bodyguard: Original Soundtrack Album&quot; became the best-selling soundtrack of all time and the best-selling album by a female artist of all time. It has been certified diamond in the United States (sales of at least ten million) with shipments of over 18 million copies. Worldwide, the sales are over 45 million copies. In addition, Houston&#x27;s cover of &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; sold over 24 million units worldwide, becoming the best-selling single by a female artist of all time.

The soundtrack features five songs which were hit singles for Houston: &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; (a cover of the Dolly Parton song), &quot;I&#x27;m Every Woman&quot; (a cover of the Chaka Khan song), the two Oscar-nominated songs, &quot;I Have Nothing&quot; and &quot;Run to You&quot;, and &quot;Queen of the Night&quot;.

Other artists who appear on the soundtrack include fellow Arista recording artists Kenny G (&quot;Even if My Heart Would Break&quot;, a duet with Aaron Neville), Lisa Stansfield (&quot;Someday I&#x27;m Coming Back&quot;) and Curtis Stigers (&quot;What&#x27;s so Funny &#x27;Bout Peace, Love and Understanding&quot;). Also included is a cover of the Bill Withers standard &quot;Lovely Day&quot; by the S.O.U.L. S.Y.S.T.E.M.

===Score===
John Barry was initially brought on to score the film, but withdrew and was replaced by Alan Silvestri. In 2013, La-La Land Records released a limited-edition CD (3,500 units) of Silvestri&#x27;s score.

==Parodies==
* &quot;The Simpsons&quot; – In the episode &quot;Mayored to the Mob&quot;, Homer Simpson receives bodyguard training from an instructor who sings &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; after the class graduates. Also in the episode, Mark Hamill gets carried by Homer in a fashion which parodies the way Costner carries Houston in the film.
* &quot;30 Rock&quot; – In the episode &quot;Hard Ball&quot;, Tracy Jordan is rescued from a mob by his entourage; his character sang &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; during the scene.
* &quot;Bulletproof&quot; – A scene in the film parodies &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; with Adam Sandler&#x27;s character singing &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; and remarking that Damon Wayans&#x27;s character can always be his bodyguard.
* &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot; – In the second-season episode &quot;I Know Why the Caged Bird Kills&quot;, after having fallen in love with her charge, Dr. Venture, bodyguard Myra Brandish says she was taught &quot;Never let them out of your sight. Never let your guard down. Never fall in love&quot;, the tag line from the film.
* &quot;In Living Color&quot; – Kim Wayans plays Grace Jones as Rachael Marron, and Jim Carrey plays Frank Farmer, complete with bad hair. The scene when Kevin Costner carries Whitney Houston off-stage from the original movie is reversed with Grace Jones carrying Frank Farmer off while singing &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;.
* &quot;The Hitman&#x27;s Bodyguard&quot; – Teaser trailer featuring Houston&#x27;s song &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;, and movie poster spoof.
* &quot;Family Guy&quot; – In the episode &quot;Boopa-dee Bappa-dee&quot;, Chris Griffin thought that the American National Anthem is &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; and sang it in front of the official, to get back American citizenship.

==Cancelled sequel==
Following the success of the film, Costner contacted his longtime friend, Diana, Princess of Wales, to star in a sequel. She agreed, and the first draft of the screenplay was completed the day before she died in 1997. Following her death, the film was scrapped.

== Remake ==
In September 2021, it was reported that Matthew Lopez will be writing a remake of the film.

==Musical adaptation==

A musical adaptation of the film opened in London&#x27;s Adelphi Theatre in the West End in the fall of 2012. David Ian, who produced the musical, received the stage rights from Kevin Costner and Lawrence Kasdan.

<text>Delta Sigma Phi (), commonly known as Delta Sig, is a fraternity established in 1899 at The City College of New York (CCNY). It was the first fraternity to be founded based on religious and ethnic acceptance. It is also one of three fraternities founded at CCNY (now a part of the City University of New York (CUNY)).

Since its inception, Delta Sigma Phi has chartered chapters at 233 different colleges and universities, with 106 actively operating undergraduate chapters and colonies across the United States as of 2023. The fraternity has more than 6,000 undergraduate members and more than 120,000 living alumni members. More than 150,000 men have been initiated into Delta Sigma Phi since its founding.

Delta Sigma Phi is a charter member of the North American Interfraternity Conference. Its national headquarters are located in Indianapolis, Indiana, at the Fairbanks Mansion, the former home of Vice President Charles Warren Fairbanks.

==History==

===1899-1919: Formation of National Fraternity===
At the end of the nineteenth century, most fraternities were exclusively Christian or Jewish and barred membership to individuals based on religion. When a group of friends at the City College of New York tried to join a fraternity, they were denied membership because their group was composed of Christians and Jews. In response, they organized the first Delta Sigma Phi chapter on December 10, 1899. The chapter was called &quot;Insula&quot; due to its location in Manhattan.

In late 1902, with five members from Insula signing incorporation papers, Delta Sigma Phi was incorporated with the purpose of spreading &quot;the principles of friendship and brotherhood among college men, without respect to race or creed.&quot; By 1903 the fraternity had established chapters at Columbia University and New York University.

Delta Sigma Phi recognizes Charles A. Tonsor Jr. (Christian) and Meyer Boskey (Jewish) as its two primary founding fathers. Although Boskey was one of the original members at the City College of New York and Tonsor was one of the charter members of the chapter at New York University, it is believed the fraternity first was developed by a group of nearly a dozen men. During the short period when men of Jewish faith were barred from membership, many of the fraternity&#x27;s founding documents were ruined. Given the circumstances, the national organization adopted both Boskey and Tonsor as the &quot;founders&quot; given their lifelong commitment to the fraternity and their service as visionaries for the development of the fraternity&#x27;s ritual and national expansion.

In the two years after the 1914 Convention, Delta Sigma Phi almost doubled in size with the addition of ten chapters. In 1915, the first West Coast chapter, &quot;Hilgard chapter&quot; at UC Berkeley was installed. Hilgard Chapter was named after a dean at the university and is the fraternity&#x27;s only chapter without a Greek letter designation, taking the place of the Xi chapter.

Also in 1914, the fraternity decided to admit only white men of the Christian faith, thus rejecting the founders&#x27; vision. Many Jewish members and other minorities left Delta Sigma Phi or joined others, including Meyer Boskey, who withdrew active participation in the fraternity for an extended period.

As a testament to the geographic shift of the fraternity, the 1916 convention was held in Chicago, Illinois. By this time, Delta Sigma Phi had expanded the number of staff, and a national headquarters was created at the Riebold Building at Dayton, Ohio.

When the United States entered World War I in 1917, Delta Sigma Phi had more than 1,000 initiates and nineteen active chapters. During the war, more than three-quarters of the fraternity&#x27;s membership served the government in some capacity with half of that number in combat duty overseas. Although colleges and universities remained open during the war, many chapters suspended their operations when most of their members were called to service. Some chapters never recovered from the disruptions of World War I.

Delta Sigma Phi continued to expand during the 1920s, with many local fraternities and other social clubs petitioning for membership. Among these was Phi Nu fraternity at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. When Phi Nu was chartered as the &quot;Alpha Omicron chapter,&quot; Delta Sigma Phi became an international fraternity.

During this time, Delta Sigma Phi published its first pledge manual, the &quot;Gordian Knot&quot;. It was based upon a manual previously published by the &quot;Epsilon chapter&quot; at Penn State. The &quot;Gordian Knot&quot; is considered to be one of the first pledge manuals to be published on a fraternity-wide basis. Another tradition started at this time was the Sailors&#x27; Ball, first held at the &quot;Alpha Chi chapter&quot; at Stetson University. Today, the Sailors&#x27; Ball is an annual event that is a semi-formal counterpart to the Carnation Ball, the fraternity&#x27;s formal banquet.

===1929-1945: Great Depression and World War II ===

Two months after the Wall Street Crash of 1929, Delta Sigma Phi&#x27;s yearly convention was held in Richmond, Virginia. Despite the financial uncertainties of the time, a traveling secretary was added to the fraternity payroll. During the Great Depression, the fraternity&#x27;s national growth came to a halt; college enrollments declined and those who attended college were less likely to be able to afford fraternity membership. Several chapters became dormant and/or lost their equity in chapter properties. Among these were &quot;Alpha&quot; and &quot;Gamma&quot;.

The only chapters chartered during the Great Depression were &quot;Beta Kappa&quot; at the University of Alabama and &quot;Beta Lambda&quot; at Wake Forest University. During this time, Executive Director A.W. Defenderfer moved the fraternity headquarters to his insurance offices in Washington, D.C..; Delta Sigma Phi was re-incorporated in Washington, D.C., in 1929. Delta Sigma Phi banned Hell Week in 1938.

Although the fraternity was rebounding by the late 1930s, World War II caused another disruption. Many members joined the war effort, leaving the chapters weak. The fraternity&#x27;s only Canadian chapter at McGill University became dormant, with many of its members joining to Commonwealth Forces. By 1944, only eleven of the fraternity&#x27;s 43 chapters were active.

===1945-1999: Post-War Growth, Desegregation, and Expansion===

After the war, the GI Bill allowed many veterans to attend college. With an influx of new students, many of the dormant chapters were re-activated. Another consequence of the GI Bill was the establishment of many new public universities. With more institutions open to fraternities, Delta Sigma Phi experienced a great period of growth.

In the late 1940s, college administrators across the country began to refuse expansion to fraternities with restrictive rules on membership. In response to the new rules, the fraternity&#x27;s leadership amended the constitution of the national fraternity to remove all references to race or religion. However, the line &quot;the belief in God is essential to our welfare&quot; in the preamble was untouched and remains so to this day.

In a compromise to several southern chapters, the amendments to the constitution were approved at the 1949 convention while language barring the initiation of non-white and non-Christians was inserted into the fraternity ritual. Since the ritual was a private document and the constitution a public one, this compromise appeased those who resisted the integration of the fraternity while allowing it to expand to new universities.

The 1950s were a turbulent time for fraternities and sororities in general. While most of the national Greek-letter organizations still had rules restricting membership, a few chapters bucked the edicts and initiated Jews and African Americans. Some of those chapters were suspended by their national organizations, while others disaffiliated from their national organizations and withdrew and became local fraternities. In 1957, the California Legislature threatened to pass Assembly Bill 758, prohibiting state universities and colleges from recognizing any student organization that &quot;restricts its membership based on either race, color, religion or national origin.&quot; Two years later, the regents of the University of California passed a regulation requiring all fraternities and sororities to sign a certificate stating the organization did not have any discriminatory policies. Failure to comply could mean the loss of recognition.

Delta Sigma Phi faced these issues at its 1959 convention. While the organization was interested in maintaining its California chapters, there was opposition to any plan to integrate the entire fraternity. Several southern chapters passed resolutions against any relaxation of racial and religious restrictions and threatened to withdraw from the fraternity. A compromise again was reached where the current rules were not to be changed but exemptions were granted to chapters in danger of losing their recognition due to fraternity policies. The California chapters immediately were given exemptions.

In 1962, the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education joined the University of California by requiring the integration of its fraternities and sororities. Exemptions were given to the chapters in Pennsylvania. While exemptions originally were granted to chapters in danger of losing recognition with their universities, the &quot;Beta Iota chapter&quot; at Wittenberg University received a special exemption. When the chapter intended to initiate an African American who was an All-American athlete and an outstanding scholar, the fraternity responded by offering an exemption, likely to avoid bad publicity.

The process of full integration was slow and awkward. As a result of several compromises the fraternity remained intact on a national level. When Civil Rights legislation was enacted, Delta Sigma Phi was once more a universal brotherhood of man, just as the founders intended.

===2000-Present===
At its 2005 convention, the fraternity adopted &quot;Vision 2025,&quot; a plan to transform Delta Sigma Phi into &quot;America&#x27;s Leading Fraternity&quot; by the year 2025 with aggressive goals for leadership training, alumni involvement, and new chapter development. Delta Sigma Phi also adopted the American Red Cross as its national philanthropy.
Among the initiatives laid out in Vision 2025, the fraternity provided leadership education to all of its undergraduates, developed &quot;The Summit&quot; to train all presidents and recruitment chairmen with professional recruitment techniques, and opened between eight and twelve chapters annually to reach 200 undergraduate chapters by 2025. Rather than closing struggling chapters with small memberships, the fraternity actively redeveloped them as they would develop a brand-new chapter.

Delta Sigma Phi established a partnership with Phired Up Productions, a fraternity and sorority recruitment consulting company, to coach its New Chapter Development team. During the second decade of the 21st Century, the fraternity began to benefit from this partnership. Twenty-two new chapter developments or redevelopments took place between 2009 and 2013. The organization-wide GPA surpassed the 3.0 mark and 100,000 dollars was made available for academic scholarships through the McKee Scholarship. The fraternity&#x27;s staff grew more than 50 percent from 2011 to 2014. The fraternity also prohibited hazing.

==Symbols==

The Sphinx was the first symbol adopted by the fraternity at the time of its inception. Chosen for its longevity and stability over centuries. Other symbols include a lamp, a lute (depicted as a lyre), a Gordian Knot, and the Egyptian Pyramids. The white carnation was chosen as the fraternity&#x27;s flower because it contains the fraternity&#x27;s colors; white and Nile green as well as being a relatively common and sturdy flower that can grow in almost any climate. The publications of the fraternity are often named after its symbols:
*The Sphinx - an esoteric publication for initiated members only
*The Gordian Knot - the new member manual
*The Lute - the fraternity songbook
*The Carnation - a quarterly publication delivered to all members
The pledge emblem is a white circle with a green equilateral triangle set inside of it. Gold lines radiate from the center of the emblem to the three points of the triangle in addition to outlining the circle and triangle. The pledge emblem is very prevalent in the symbolism of the fraternity; not only is the emblem on the pledge pin, but the emblem also graces the flag, the membership badge and the basic design is also the basis of the fraternity&#x27;s seal.

It is also common tradition for a New Member to present their &quot;Big&quot; with a decorated paddle.

==Current Programs==
The Biennial Convention: The longest-running program of the Fraternity, occurring for the 64th time in 2025. Delegates from undergraduate chapters and alumni group elect members to the Grand Council and vote on amendments to the Constitution or general resolutions. The program also regularly includes a silent auction through the Fraternity Foundation, breakout educational sessions, service activities, and social activities/excursions. 

Leadership Institute: A five-day for up to 50 undergraduate participants and led entirely by trained alumni volunteers. The Leadership Institute was launched in 1993, and teaches general and foundational elements of leadership. 

LEAD Weekend: Two-day programs focused on Membership Growth, Health and Safety, and Membership Experience. Lead Weekends occur in 3-4 locations annually and are primarily targeted at executive officer members of undergraduate chapters.

Cycyota Volunteer Institute: An online program offering skills and policy education for volunteer advisors, alumni chapter officers, alumni association officers, and alumni corporation (housing) board members.

Philanthropy
For much of the 21st Century, the fraternity considered the American Red Cross its official philanthropic partner and focus. Chapters were encouraged to organize blood drives and to raise funds with the American Red Cross, and to build relationships with their local Red Cross Chapters. Other initiatives included members receiving CPR certification and several inter-chapter fundraising.

In the 2020&#x27;s, the Fraternity moved away from alignment with one philanthropic partner, and chapters are currently encouraged to establish a philanthropic relationship with a local charity (or charities). 

== Affiliated Organizations ==
Foundation: The Delta Sigma Phi Foundation is a charitable and educational not-for-profit organization, separate and independent from Delta Sigma Phi Fraternity. Donations to the Foundation are used to cover or subsidize the cost of the Fraternity&#x27;s national education programs. The Foundation also offers several scholarships, the largest of which is the McKee Scholarship, which has awarded over $1,000,000 in scholarships to undergraduate and graduate members since 2009. The Foundation also allows for donations to chapter-designated leadership funds. Members may submit grant requests to utilize these funds for education-related expenses, such as workshops or upgrades to study facilities/materials.

Housing Corporation: The National Housing Corporation is a non-profit 501c7 company providing housing support and services to chapters of the Fraternity. Not all chapter facilities are owned or operated by the National Housing Corporation.

== Chapters ==
==Notable members==
== Individual chapter or member misconduct ==
In 2001, the &quot;Kappa chapter&quot; at Auburn University had its charter revoked after a Halloween party where members were present in blackface, Ku Klux Klan robes, and simulating a lynching. After being reinstated, their charter was again revoked following numerous incidents involving hazing, vandalism, alcohol and harassment in 2017.

In 2014, the chapter at San Diego State University was shut down due to a string of hazing and alcohol violations, and misconduct, including waving dildos at protestors during an anti-rape rally on campus.

In 2024, three members of the University of Texas at Austin chapter, including the vice president, were arrested for allegedly attacking a gay man.

<text>Robbie James Lyons (July 10, 1972 – December 5, 2003) was convicted of the 1993 murder of Stephen Wilson Stafford and in 2003 was executed at Central Prison in Raleigh, North Carolina.

==Prior arrests==
A series of arrests and releases in 1993 preceded the murder for which Lyons was later executed. Convicted on 16 April 1993 on multiple charges of larceny and forgery, Lyons was sentenced to 17 months in prison; however, he served only a month of this sentence and was released on 17 May 1993. He was arrested again a month later on charges of armed robbery, for which he received three years probation on a plea bargain; he used an alias, and even though his real name was known, his prior arrest and improper release were overlooked. Finally, four days before the murder of Stephen Stafford, Lyons was arrested a third time for failure to appear in court, for which he was released on a $50 bond.

==Crime==
The murder of Stephen Wilson Stafford occurred on 25 September 1993, apparently as part of an attempted robbery. Stafford was the owner of a small store in Forsyth County, North Carolina. According to the testimony of Derick Hall, an alleged accomplice who was in the store with Lyons at the time of the murder, Lyons chose to rob the store on the spur of the moment because he was out of money. Hall claimed not to have participated directly in the robbery, but that he heard Lyons fire five shots at Stafford and disappear; Hall turned himself into police custody on the following day. Victoria Lytle, a witness who had just left Stafford&#x27;s store, also claimed that she heard gunshots and saw Lyons leave the store with a gun in hand shortly afterwards.

===Trial===
Following Lyons&#x27;s conviction on 6 May 1994, allegations arose of poor legal representation; Lyons&#x27;s trial attorneys put forward no evidence during the trial. Additionally, Lyons&#x27;s primary attorney was primarily a real estate lawyer and had only met Lyons once before the trial. A psychologist testified during deliberations on Lyons&#x27;s sentencing that he suffered from bipolar disorder, antisocial personality disorder and had a history of substance abuse from a very early age. Lyons&#x27;s mother provided an affidavit, which was not presented at trial, testifying that Lyons was the result of an unexpected teenage pregnancy and grew up in a household where he was regularly abused and beaten by his grandmother.

Lyons&#x27;s extensive and violent criminal history was a factor brought forward by those arguing against clemency. A month prior to his execution, Lyons assaulted a prison guard and prison authorities placed him in solitary confinement for the final days of his incarceration.

After the U.S. Supreme Court denied a petition for a writ of certiorari in Lyons&#x27;s case on 6 October 2003, the state of North Carolina set an execution date of 5 December 2003. Lyons was set to be the seventh convicted murderer executed by North Carolina that year, making 2003 a peak for executions in the state (exceeded only in recent history by 1949, which saw 10 executions).

===Execution===
As was customary, North Carolina governor Mike Easley reviewed pleas for clemency; prior to the execution he met both with Lyons&#x27;s defense attorneys and members of Stafford&#x27;s family. Reverend Jesse Jackson also wrote to Mike Easley just prior to Lyons&#x27;s execution, also pleading for a commutation of the death sentence. Easley declined to commute Lyons&#x27;s death sentence.

Lyons&#x27;s last meal prior to his execution was pizza and lasagna, both prepared in accordance with Islamic dietary laws, and a Pepsi. His final words were: &quot;It is from Allah that I come and it is to Allah that I return. If my death brings another person happiness, then I&#x27;m happy for them.&quot; Lyons was pronounced dead at North Carolina&#x27;s Central Prison in Raleigh at 2:17 a.m. in the early morning of December 5, 2003. His execution was the 885th carried out in the United States, and the 30th in North Carolina, since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976.

Lyons spent 9 years, 6 months, and 29 days on death row.

<text>Jules Ralph Feiffer (January 26, 1929 – January 17, 2025) was an American cartoonist and author, who at one time was considered the most widely read satirist in the country. He won the Pulitzer Prize in 1986 for editorial cartooning, and in 2004 he was inducted into the Comic Book Hall of Fame. He wrote the animated short &quot;Munro&quot;, which won an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film in 1961. The Library of Congress has recognized his &quot;remarkable legacy&quot;, from 1946 to the present, as a cartoonist, playwright, screenwriter, adult and children&#x27;s book author, illustrator, and art instructor.

When Feiffer was 17 (in the mid-1940s) he became assistant to cartoonist Will Eisner. There he helped Eisner write and illustrate his comic strips, including &quot;The Spirit&quot;. In 1956, he became a staff cartoonist at &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, where he produced the weekly comic strip titled &quot;Feiffer&quot; until 1997. His cartoons became nationally syndicated in 1959 and then appeared regularly in publications including the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, the &quot;London Observer&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, and &quot;The Nation&quot;. In 1997, he created the first op-ed page comic strip for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which ran monthly until 2000.

Feiffer wrote more than 35 books, plays, and screenplays. His first of many collections of satirical cartoons, &quot;Sick, Sick, Sick,&quot; was published in 1958, and his first novel, &quot;Harry, the Rat With Women&quot;, in 1963. In 1965, he wrote &quot;The Great Comic Book Heroes&quot;, the first history of the comic-book superheroes of the late 1930s and early 1940s and a tribute to their creators. In 1979, Feiffer created his first graphic novel, &quot;Tantrum&quot;. By 1993, he began writing and illustrating books aimed at young readers, with several of them winning awards.

Feiffer began writing for the theater and film in 1961, with plays including &quot;Little Murders&quot; (1967), &quot;Feiffer&#x27;s People&quot; (1969), and &quot;Knock Knock&quot; (1976). He wrote the screenplay for &quot;Carnal Knowledge&quot; (1971), directed by Mike Nichols, and &quot;Popeye&quot; (1980), directed by Robert Altman. At the time of his death, he was working on a visual memoir.

==Early life==
Feiffer was born in The Bronx, New York City, on January 26, 1929. His parents were David Feiffer and Rhoda (), and Feiffer was raised in a Jewish household with a younger and an older sister. His father was usually unemployed in his work as a salesman due to the Depression. His mother was a fashion designer who made watercolor drawings of her designs which she sold to various clothing manufacturers in New York. &quot;She&#x27;d go door to door selling her designs for $3,&quot; recalled Feiffer. The fact that she was the breadwinner, however, created an &quot;atmosphere of silent blame&quot; in the home. Feiffer began drawing at the age of 3. &quot;My mother always encouraged me to draw&quot;, he said.

When he was 13, his mother gave him a drawing table for his bedroom. She also enrolled him in the Art Students League of New York to study anatomy. He graduated from James Monroe High School in 1947. He won a John Wanamaker Art Contest medal for a crayon drawing of the radio Western hero Tom Mix. He wrote in 1965 about his childhood:

Feiffer said that cartoons were his first interest when young, &quot;what I loved the most.&quot; He stated that because he couldn&#x27;t write well enough to be a writer, or draw well enough to be an artist, he realized that the best way to succeed would be to combine his limited talents in each of those fields to create something unique. He read comic strips from various newspapers which his father brought home, and was mostly attracted to the way they told stories. &quot;What I loved best about these comics was that they created a very personal world in which almost anything could take place&quot;, Feiffer said. &quot;And readers would accept it even if it had nothing to do with any other kind of world. It was the fantasy world I loved.&quot;

Among his favorite cartoons were &quot;Our Boarding House&quot;, &quot;Alley Oop&quot; and &quot;Wash Tubbs&quot;. He began to decipher features of different cartoonists, such as the sentimental naturalism of &quot;Abbie an&#x27; Slats&quot;, the [Preston] Sturges-like characters and plots of others, with cadenced dialogue. He recalls that Will Eisner&#x27;s &quot;Spirit&quot; rivaled them in structure. And no strip, except [Milton] Caniff&#x27;s &quot;Terry [and the Pirates]&quot;, rivaled it in atmosphere.&quot;

==Career==
===Cartoonist===
====With Will Eisner (1946–1956)====
After Feiffer graduated from high school at 16, he was desperate for a job, and went unannounced to the office of one of his favorite cartoonists, Will Eisner. Eisner was sympathetic to young Feiffer, as Eisner had been in a similar situation when he first started out. He asked Feiffer, &quot;What can you do?&quot; He answered, &quot;I&#x27;ll do anything. I&#x27;ll do coloring, or clean-up, or anything, and I&#x27;d like to work for nothing.&quot; However, Eisner was unimpressed by Feiffer&#x27;s art abilities and did not know how he could employ him. Eisner ultimately decided to give him a low-paying job when he found out that Feiffer &quot;knew more about him than anybody who had ever lived,&quot; said Feiffer. &quot;He had no choice but to hire me as a groupie.&quot;

Eisner considered Feiffer a mediocre artist, but he &quot;liked the kid&#x27;s spunk and intensity&quot;, writes Eisner biographer Michael Schumacher. Eisner was also aware that they both came from similar backgrounds, despite his being twelve years older. They both had fathers who struggled to support their family, and both their mothers were strong figures who held the family together through hardships. &quot;He had a hunger for comics that Eisner rarely saw in artists&quot;, notes Schumacher. &quot;Eisner decided that there was something to this wisecracking kid.&quot; When Feiffer later asked for a raise, Eisner instead gave him his own page in &quot;The Spirit&quot; section, and let him do his own coloring. As Eisner recalled in 1978:

They collaborated well on &quot;The Spirit&quot;, sharing ideas, arguing points, and making changes when they agreed. In 1947, Feiffer also attended the Pratt Institute for a year to improve his art style. Over time, Eisner valued Feiffer&#x27;s opinions and judgments more often, appreciating his &quot;uncanny knack&quot; for capturing the way people talked, without using contrived dialogue. Eisner recalls that Feiffer &quot;had a real ear for writing characters that lived and breathed. Jules was always attentive to nuances, such as sounds and expressions&quot; which made stories seem more real.

====At &quot;The Village Voice&quot; (1956–1997)====

After working with Eisner for nearly a decade, he chose to start creating his own comic strips. In 1956, after again first proving his talent by working for free, he became a staff cartoonist at &quot;The Village Voice&quot; where he produced a weekly comic strip. Feiffer&#x27;s strips ran for 42 years, until 1997, at first titled &quot;Sick Sick Sick&quot;, then as &quot;Feiffer&#x27;s Fables&quot;, and finally as simply &quot;Feiffer&quot;. After a year with the &quot;Voice&quot;, Feiffer compiled a collection of many of his satire cartoons into a best-selling book, &quot;Sick Sick Sick: A Guide to Non-Confident Living&quot; (1958), a dissection of popular social and political neuroses. The success of that collection led to his becoming a regular contributor to the &quot;London Observer&quot; and &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine. Director Stanley Kubrick, a fellow Bronx native, invited Feiffer to write a screenplay for &quot;Sick, Sick, Sick&quot;, although the film was never made. After first becoming aware of Feiffer&#x27;s work, Kubrick wrote him in 1958:

By April 1959, &quot;Feiffer&quot; was distributed nationally by the Hall Syndicate, initially in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, &quot;Minneapolis Star Tribune&quot;, &quot;Newark Star-Ledger&quot; and &quot;Long Island Press&quot;. Eventually, his strips covered the nation, including magazines, and were published regularly in major publications such as the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;Playboy&quot; and &quot;The Nation&quot;. He was commissioned in 1997 by &quot;The New York Times&quot; to create its first op-ed page comic strip, which ran monthly until 2000.

Feiffer&#x27;s cartoons were typically mini-satires, where he portrayed ordinary people&#x27;s thoughts about subjects such as sex, marriage, violence and politics. Writer Larry DuBois describes Feiffer&#x27;s cartoon style:

===Author===

Feiffer published the hit &quot;Sick, Sick, Sick: A Guide to Non-Confident Living&quot; in 1958 (which featured a collection of cartoons from about 1950 to 1956), and followed up with &quot;More Sick, Sick, Sick&quot; and other strip collections, including &quot;The Explainers&quot;; &quot;Boy, Girl. Boy, Girl.&quot;; &quot;Hold Me!&quot;; &quot;Feiffer&#x27;s Album&quot;; &quot;The Unexpurgated Memoirs of Bernard Mergendeiler&quot;; &quot;Feiffer on Nixon&quot;; &quot;Jules Feiffer&#x27;s America: From Eisenhower to Reagan&quot;; &quot;Marriage Is an Invasion of Privacy&quot;; and &quot;Feiffer&#x27;s Children&quot;. &quot;Passionella&quot; (1957) is a graphic narrative initially anthologized in &quot;Passionella and Other Stories&quot;, a variation on the story of &quot;Cinderella&quot;. The protagonist is Ella, a chimney sweep who is transformed into a Hollywood movie star. &quot;Passionella&quot; was used as one part of the 1966 Sheldon Harnick and Jerry Bock Broadway musical &quot;The Apple Tree&quot;. 

His cartoons, strips and illustrations have been reprinted by Fantagraphics as &quot;Feiffer: The Collected Works&quot;. &quot;Explainers&quot; (2008) reprints all of his strips from 1956 to 1966. David Kamp reviewed the book in &quot;The New York Times&quot;:

Feiffer has written two novels (1963&#x27;s &quot;Harry the Rat with Women&quot;, 1977&#x27;s &quot;Ackroyd&quot;) and several children&#x27;s books, including &quot;Bark, George&quot;; &quot;Henry, The Dog with No Tail&quot;; &quot;A Room with a Zoo&quot;; &quot;The Daddy Mountain&quot;; and &quot;A Barrel of Laughs, a Vale of Tears&quot;. He partnered with The Walt Disney Company and writer Andrew Lippa to adapt his book &quot;The Man in the Ceiling&quot; into a musical. He illustrated the children&#x27;s books &quot;The Phantom Tollbooth&quot; and &quot;The Odious Ogre&quot;. His non-fiction includes the 1965 book &quot;The Great Comic Book Heroes&quot;.

Feiffer also wrote and drew one of the earliest graphic novels, the hardcover &quot;Tantrum&quot; (Alfred A. Knopf, 1979), described on its dustjacket as a &quot;novel-in-pictures&quot;. Like the trade paperback &quot;The Silver Surfer&quot; (Simon &amp; Schuster/Fireside Books, August 1978), by Marvel Comics&#x27; Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, and the hardcover and trade paperback versions of Will Eisner&#x27;s &quot;A Contract with God, and Other Tenement Stories&quot; (Baronet Books, October 1978), this was published by a traditional book publisher and distributed through bookstores, whereas other early graphic novels, such as &quot;Sabre&quot; (Eclipse Books, August 1978), were distributed through some of the first comic-book stores.

His autobiography, &quot;Backing into Forward: A Memoir&quot; (Doubleday, 2010), received positive reviews from &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, which wrote:

He has had retrospectives at the New York Historical Society, the Library of Congress and The School of Visual Arts. His artwork is exhibited at and represented by Chicago&#x27;s Jean Albano Gallery. In 1996, Feiffer donated his papers and several hundred original cartoons and book illustrations to the Library of Congress.

In 2014, Feiffer published &quot;Kill My Mother: A Graphic Novel&quot; through Liveright Publishing. &quot;Kill My Mother&quot; was named a &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; Best Book of 2014 and a &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; Best Fiction Book of 2014. In 2016, Feiffer published &quot;Cousin Joseph: A Graphic Novel&quot;, a prequel to &quot;Kill My Mother&quot;. &quot;Cousin Joseph&quot; was also published through Liveright Publishing, and was a &quot;New York Times&quot; Bestseller, named one of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;&#x27;s Best Graphic Novels of the Year, and was nominated for the Lynd Ward Graphic Novel Prize. A third book in the series, &quot;The Ghost Script: A Graphic Novel&quot;, was published by Liveright in 2018.

Feiffer&#x27;s picture book for young readers, &quot;Rupert Can Dance&quot;, was published by FSG in 2014.

===Playwright and screenwriter===
Feiffer&#x27;s plays include &quot;Little Murders&quot; (1967), &quot;Feiffer&#x27;s People&quot; (1969), &quot;Knock Knock&quot; (1976), &quot;Elliot Loves&quot; (1990), &quot;The White House Murder Case&quot;, and &quot;Grown Ups&quot;. After Mike Nichols adapted Feiffer&#x27;s unproduced play &quot;Carnal Knowledge&quot; as a 1971 film, Feiffer scripted Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;Popeye&quot;, Alain Resnais&#x27;s &quot;I Want to Go Home&quot;, and the film adaptation of &quot;Little Murders&quot;.

The original production of &quot;Hold Me!&quot; was directed by Caymichael Patten and opened at The American Place Theatre, Subplot Cafe, as part of its American Humorist Series on January 13, 1977. The production ran on the Showtime cable network in 1981.

Feiffer moved to Shelter Island, New York in 2017. He wrote the book for a musical based on a story he wrote earlier, &quot;Man in the Ceiling&quot;, about a boy cartoonist who learned to pursue his dream despite pressures to conform. The musical was produced and directed by Jeffrey Seller in 2017 at the Bay Street Theatre in neighboring Sag Harbor, New York.

===Art instructor===
Feiffer was an adjunct professor at Stony Brook Southampton. Previously he taught at the Yale School of Drama and Northwestern University. He has been a Senior Fellow at the Columbia University National Arts Journalism Program. He was in residence at the Arizona State University Barrett Honors College from November 27 to December 2, 2006. In June–August 2009, Feiffer was in residence as a Montgomery Fellow at Dartmouth College, where he taught an undergraduate course on graphic humor in the 20th century.

==Personal life==
Feiffer was married three times and had three children. His daughter Halley Feiffer is an actress and playwright. A second daughter, Kate Feiffer, is the author and playwright of &quot;My Mom Is Trying to Ruin My Life&quot; and other works.

His third marriage took place in September 2016, when he married freelance writer JZ Holden; the ceremony combined Jewish and Buddhist traditions. She is the author of &quot;Illusion of Memory&quot; (2013).

Feiffer lived in upstate New York with his wife and their two cats. He died from congestive heart failure at his home in Richfield Springs, New York, on January 17, 2025, at the age of 95.

<doc id="412481" wikidata="Q437363" url="?curid=412481" title="Christina Hoff Sommers">
<text>Christina Marie Hoff Sommers (born September 28, 1950) is an American author and philosopher. Specializing in ethics, she is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. Sommers is known for her critique of contemporary feminism. Her work includes the books &quot;Who Stole Feminism?&quot; (1994) and &quot;The War Against Boys&quot; (2000). She also hosts a video blog called &quot;The Factual Feminist&quot;.

Sommers&#x27; positions and writing have been characterized by the &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot; as &quot;equity feminism&quot;, a classical-liberal or libertarian feminist perspective holding that the main political role of feminism is to ensure that the right against coercive interference is not infringed. Sommers has contrasted equity feminism with what she terms &quot;victim feminism&quot; and &quot;gender feminism&quot;, arguing that modern feminist thought often contains an &quot;irrational hostility to men&quot; and possesses an &quot;inability to take seriously the possibility that the sexes are equal but different&quot;. Several writers have described Sommers&#x27; positions as anti-feminist.

==Early life and education==
Sommers was born in 1950 to Kenneth and Dolores Hoff. She attended the University of Paris, earned a B.A. degree at New York University in 1971, and earned a Ph.D. degree in philosophy from Brandeis University in 1979.

==Career==
===Ideas and views===
Sommers has called herself an equity feminist, equality feminist, and liberal feminist The &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot; categorizes equity feminism as libertarian or classically liberal.

Several authors have described Sommers&#x27; positions as antifeminist. The feminist philosopher Alison Jaggar wrote in 2006 that, in rejecting the theoretical distinction between sex as a set of physiological traits and gender as a set of social identities, &quot;Sommers rejected one of the distinctive conceptual innovations of second wave Western feminism,&quot; arguing that as the concept of gender is allegedly relied on by &quot;virtually all&quot; modern feminists, &quot;the conclusion that Sommers is an anti-feminist instead of a feminist is difficult to avoid&quot;. Sommers has denied that she is anti-feminist.

Sommers has criticized women&#x27;s studies as being dominated by man-hating feminists with an interest in portraying women as victims. According to &quot;The Nation&quot;, Sommers would tell her students that &quot;statistically challenged&quot; feminists in women&#x27;s studies departments engage in &quot;bad scholarship to advance their liberal agenda&quot;.

Sommers has denied the existence of the gender pay gap.

===Early work===
From 1978 to 1980, Sommers was an instructor at the University of Massachusetts at Boston. In 1980, she became an assistant professor of philosophy at Clark University and was promoted to associate professor in 1986. Sommers remained at Clark until 1997, when she became the W.H. Brady fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.
During the mid-1980s, Sommers edited two philosophy textbooks on the subject of ethics: &quot;Vice &amp; Virtue in Everyday Life: Introductory Readings in Ethics&quot; (1984) and &quot;Right and Wrong: Basic Readings in Ethics&quot; (1986). Reviewing &quot;Vice and Virtue&quot; for &quot;Teaching Philosophy&quot; in 1990, Nicholas Dixon wrote that the book was &quot;extremely well edited&quot; and &quot;particularly strong on the motivation for studying virtue and ethics in the first place, and on theoretical discussions of virtue and vice in general.&quot;

Beginning in the late 1980s, Sommers published a series of articles in which she strongly criticized feminist philosophers and American feminism in general. According to philosopher Marilyn Friedman, Sommers blamed feminists for contributing to rising divorce rates and the breakdown of the traditional family, and rejected feminist critiques of traditional forms of marriage, family, and femininity. In a 1988 &quot;Public Affairs Quarterly&quot; article titled &quot;Should the Academy Support Academic Feminism?&quot;, Sommers wrote that &quot;the intellectual and moral credentials of academic feminism badly want scrutiny&quot; and asserted that &quot;the tactics used by academic feminists have all been employed at one time or another to further other forms of academic imperialism.&quot; In articles titled &quot;The Feminist Revelation&quot; and &quot;Philosophers Against the Family,&quot; which she published during the early 1990s, Sommers argued that many academic feminists were &quot;radical philosophers&quot; who sought dramatic social and cultural change—such as the abolition of the nuclear family—and thus revealed their contempt for the actual wishes of the &quot;average woman.&quot; These articles, which Friedman states are &quot;marred by ambiguities, inconsistencies, dubious factual claims, misrepresentations of feminist literature, and faulty arguments&quot;, would form the basis for Sommers&#x27; 1994 book &quot;Who Stole Feminism?&quot;.

===Later work===
Sommers has written articles for &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. She hosts a video blog called &quot;The Factual Feminist&quot; on YouTube. Sommers created a video &quot;course&quot; for the conservative website PragerU.

Sommers has also appeared on Red Ice&#x27;s white nationalist podcast Radio 3Fourteen. Sommers later said that she did not know about the podcast prior to her appearance.

===&quot;Who Stole Feminism?&quot;===

In &quot;Who Stole Feminism?&quot;, Sommers outlines her distinction between &quot;gender feminism&quot;, which she regards as being the dominant contemporary approach to feminism, and &quot;equity feminism&quot;, which she presents as more akin to first-wave feminism. She uses the work to argue that contemporary feminism is too radical and disconnected from the lives of typical American women, presenting her equity feminism alternative as a better match for their needs. Sommers describes herself as &quot;a feminist who does not like what feminism has become&quot;. She characterizes gender feminism as having transcended the liberalism of early feminists so that instead of focusing on rights for all, gender feminists view society through the sex/gender prism and focus on recruiting women to join the struggle against patriarchy. &quot;Reason&quot; reviewed &quot;Who Stole Feminism?: How Women Have Betrayed Women&quot; and characterized gender feminism as the action of accenting the differences of genders in order to create what Sommers believes is privilege for women in academia, government, industry, or the advancement of personal agendas.

In criticizing contemporary feminism, Sommers writes that an often-mentioned March of Dimes study, which says that &quot;domestic violence is the leading cause of birth defects,” does not exist and that violence against women does not peak during the Super Bowl, which she describes as an urban legend. She argues that such statements about domestic violence helped shape the Violence Against Women Act, which initially allocated $1.6 billion a year in federal funds for ending domestic violence against women. Similarly, she argues that feminists assert that approximately 150,000 women die each year from anorexia, an apparent distortion of the American Anorexia and Bulimia Association&#x27;s figure that 150,000 females have some degree of anorexia.

===&quot;The War Against Boys&quot;===

In 2000, Sommers published The War Against Boys: How Misguided Feminism Is Harming Our Young Men. In the book, Sommers challenged what she called the &quot;myth of shortchanged girls&quot; and the &quot;new and equally corrosive fiction&quot; that &quot;boys as a group are disturbed.&quot; Criticizing programs that had been set up in the 1980s to encourage girls and young women, largely in response to studies that had suggested that girls &quot;suffered through neglect in the classroom and the indifference of male-dominated society,&quot; Sommers argued in &quot;The War Against Boys&quot; that such programs were based on flawed research. She asserted that reality was quite the opposite: boys were a year and a half behind girls in reading and writing, and they were less likely to go to college.

She blamed Carol Gilligan as well as organizations such as the National Organization for Women (NOW) for creating a situation in which &quot;boys are resented, both as the unfairly privileged sex and as obstacles on the path to gender justice for girls.&quot; According to Sommers, &quot;a review of the facts shows boys, not girls, on the weak side of an education gender gap.&quot;

The book received mixed reviews. In conservative publications such as the &quot;National Review&quot; and &quot;Commentary&quot;, &quot;The War Against Boys&quot; was praised for its &quot;stinging indictment of an anti-male movement that has had a pervasive influence on the nation&#x27;s schools&quot; and for identifying &quot;a problem in urgent need of redress.&quot; Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, opinion columnist Richard Bernstein called it a &quot;thoughtful, provocative book&quot; and suggested that Sommers had made her arguments &quot;persuasively and unflinchingly, and with plenty of data to support them.&quot; Joy Summers, in &quot;The Journal of School Choice&quot;, said that &quot;Sommers’ book and her public voice are in themselves a small antidote to the junk science girding our typically commonsense-free, utterly ideological national debate on &#x27;women&#x27;s issues&#x27;.&quot; &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; suggested that Sommers&#x27; conclusions were &quot;compelling&quot; and &quot;deserve an unbiased hearing,&quot; while also noting that Sommers &quot;descends into pettiness when she indulges in mudslinging at her opponents.&quot; Similarly, a review in &quot;Booklist&quot; suggested that while Sommers &quot;argues cogently that boys are having major problems in school,&quot; the book was unlikely to convince all readers &quot;that these problems are caused by the American Association of University Women, Carol Gilligan, Mary Pipher, and William S. Pollack,&quot; all of whom were strongly criticized in the book. Ultimately, the review suggested, &quot;Sommers is as much of a crisismonger as those she critiques.&quot;

In a review of &quot;The War Against Boys&quot; for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, child psychiatrist Robert Coles wrote that Sommers &quot;speaks of our children, yet hasn&#x27;t sought them out; instead she attends those who have, in fact, worked with boys and girls—and in so doing is quick to look askance at Carol Gilligan&#x27;s ideas about girls, [William] Pollack&#x27;s about boys.&quot; Much of the book, according to Coles, &quot;comes across as Sommers&#x27;s strongly felt war against those two prominent psychologists, who have spent years trying to learn how young men and women grow to adulthood in the United States.&quot; Reviewing the book for &quot;The New Yorker,&quot; Nicholas Lemann wrote that Sommers &quot;sets the research bar considerably higher for the people she is attacking than she does for herself,&quot; using an &quot;odd, ambushing style of refutation, in which she demands that data be provided to her and questions answered, and then, when the flummoxed person on the other end of the line stammers helplessly, triumphantly reports that she got &#x27;em.&quot; Lemann faulted Sommers for accusing Gilligan of using anecdotal argument when her own book &quot;rests on an anecdotal base&quot; and for making numerous assertions that were not supported by the footnotes in her book.

Writing in &quot;The Washington Post,&quot; E. Anthony Rotundo stated that &quot;in the end, Sommers ... does not show that there is a &#x27;war against boys.&#x27; All she can show is that feminists are attacking her &#x27;boys-will-be-boys&#x27; concept of boyhood, just as she attacks their more flexible notion.&quot; Sommers&#x27;s title, according to Rotundo, &quot;is not just wrong but inexcusably misleading... a work of neither dispassionate social science nor reflective scholarship; it is a conservative polemic.&quot;

In the updated and revised edition published in 2013, Sommers responded to her critics by changing the subtitle of the book from &quot;How misguided feminism harms our young men&quot; to &quot;How misguided policies harm our young men&quot;, and provided new and updated statistics that position her earlier work, in her view, as prophetic. When asked by &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; whether her work is still controversial, Sommers responded:

==Advocacy==
Sommers has served on the board of the Women&#x27;s Freedom Network, a group formed as an alternative to &quot;extremist, ideological feminism&quot; as well as to &quot;antifeminist traditionalism&quot; but described by historian Debra L. Schultz as comprising mostly &quot;conservative ideologues in the political correctness debates&quot;. In the 1990s, she was a member of the National Association of Scholars, a conservative political advocacy group. She is a member of the Board of Advisors of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education. She has served on the national advisory board of the Independent Women&#x27;s Forum and the Center of the American Experiment.

Sommers has defended the Gamergate harassment campaign, saying that its members were &quot;just defending a hobby they love.&quot; This advocacy in favor of Gamergate earned her praise from members of the men&#x27;s rights movement, inspiring fan art and the nickname &quot;Based Mom&quot;, which Sommers embraced. During Gamergate, Sommers appeared at several events with far-right political commentator Milo Yiannopoulos.
In 2019, Sommers endorsed Andrew Yang&#x27;s campaign during the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries.

==Awards==
The Women&#x27;s Political Caucus (NWPC) awarded Sommers with one of its twelve 2013 Exceptional Merit in Media Awards for her &quot;The New York Times&quot; article “The Boys at the Back.” In their description of the winners, NWPC states, &quot;Author Christina Sommers asks whether we should allow girls to reap the advantages of a new knowledge based service economy and take the mantle from boys, or should we acknowledge the roots of feminism and strive for equal education for all?&quot;

==Personal life==
Sommers married Fred Sommers, the Harry A. Wolfson Chair in Philosophy at Brandeis University, in 1981. He died in 2014. Through Fred, her stepson is Tamler Sommers; who is a philosopher and podcast host.

<doc id="412487" wikidata="Q369528" url="?curid=412487" title="River Tame, West Midlands">
<text>The River Tame is a river in the West Midlands of England, and one of the principal tributaries of the River Trent. The Tame is about long from the source at Oldbury to its confluence with the Trent near Alrewas, but the main river length of the entire catchment, i.e. the Tame and its main tributaries, is about .

It forms part of the Severn-Trent flyway, a route used by migratory birds to cross Great Britain.

== Etymology ==
The name derives from the Celtic language, although it may have even earlier roots. It is usually thought to mean &quot;dark&quot;, by analogy with the Sanskrit word &quot;tamas&quot; meaning darkness. Other possibilities are &quot;slow-moving&quot; or &quot;flowing&quot;, although the precise meaning is uncertain. The name is shared with the River Tame, Greater Manchester, and it is likely that the River Thame, the River Thames, the River Teme, the River Team, and the River Tamar all share the derivation.

== Historic significance ==
Birmingham and the parishes in the centre and north of the modern conurbation were probably colonised by the &quot;Tomsaete&quot; or &quot;Tomsæte&quot; (&quot;Tame-dwellers&quot;), an Anglian tribe living in the valley of the Tame and around Tamworth during the Kingdom of Mercia. They migrated up the valleys of the Trent and Tame from the Humber Estuary, and later formed Mercia.

==Course and catchment==
The Tame is generally considered to have two main sources; Willenhall and Oldbury. The tributaries arising in these locations are generally known as the Willenhall arm and the Oldbury arm of the Tame. However, some of its tributary streams, including Waddens Brook, rise as far to the west and north as Bilston and Wednesfield in the city of Wolverhampton. Much of the course of the river has been modified over the centuries, and the urban sections now run mainly through culverts or canalised channels. Both arms of the Tame flow through the Black Country to their confluence at Bescot, on the edge of Walsall.

===The Willenhall or Wolverhampton arm===
The northern arm is easily traced from Bentley, near Willenhall. However, the SMURF project traces it back as far as Stow Heath, near Bilston, where it is marked by a marshy patch at the northern end of the City of Wolverhampton College&#x27;s Wellington Road campus; hence, SMURF (Sustainable Management of Urban Rivers and Floodplains) uses the term &quot;Wolverhampton arm&quot; for this section of the Tame. Victorian Ordnance Survey maps trace the sources of the Tame further back, to the site of the old Stow Heath colliery, which is now Wolverhampton&#x27;s East Park.

The stream runs invisibly but generally north-eastward through Stowlawn, and then cuts across the southern edge of Willenhall, appearing briefly among the warehouses, and picking up reinforcement from the Waddens Brook, which originates in Wednesfield. It appears definitively at Watery Lane and Noose Lane, even more so at Bentley, where it runs southward through the industrial part of Bentley, before turning south-eastward, following a realigned course alongside and beneath the M6 motorway, to Bescot.
===The Oldbury arm===
The southern arm appears prominently close to Oldbury town centre, which gives it its name, but can be traced back to an industrial area at Titford, just west of the M5 motorway, between Whiteheath and Langley Green. It winds its way up through Langley and around the southern and eastern edges of Oldbury town centre, surfacing due south of Sandwell &amp; Dudley railway station, from which point it remains mainly on the surface and is easily traced. Bearing generally north-westward, it skirts Brades Village and flows into Tipton. Here it passes through Sheepwash Urban Park and Horseley Heath to the centre of Great Bridge. Leaving Tipton, it then zig-zags across the southern and eastern parts of Wednesbury, to meet the Willenhall or Wolverhampton arm at Bescot.
===The Main Stream===
The unified Tame then flows—partly through channels realigned to make way for the M6 motorway and its interchange with the M5—through Sandwell Valley and into north Birmingham. It passes through Hamstead and Perry Hall Park to Perry Barr, where it is crossed by the Perry Bridge of 1711, then through Witton and beneath both Gravelly Hill Interchange (where it is fed by the Rea) and Bromford Viaduct, to Washwood Heath.
Skirting to the north of Castle Bromwich, it leaves Birmingham to the north-east at Park Hall Nature Reserve, passing Water Orton in Warwickshire. At Hams Hall, immediately after its confluence with the River Blythe and the little River Bourne, it turns sharply to take up a northward course, and soon feeds into the large complex of water purification lakes at Lea Marston that now make up Kingsbury Water Park. It then crosses into Staffordshire, flowing through Middleton Lakes RSPB reserve in a wide valley between Drayton Bassett to the west and Dosthill to the east. It then flows under Watling Street to the east of Fazeley, and under an aqueduct carrying the Coventry Canal. It continues northward to Tamworth, which takes its name from the river, where it is joined by the River Anker immediately to the east of Lady Bridge beneath the strategically positioned Tamworth Castle. The river continues its generally northward route past Hopwas, Comberford and Elford until it arrives at the National Memorial Arboretum where it forms the boundary between this and the Croxall Lakes Nature Reserve. After this, it flows under the railway at Wichnor Viaduct to its confluence with the Trent near Alrewas. The eventual outflow is into the North Sea, via the Humber Estuary. When the Tame and Trent meet, the Tame is the bigger river, the Trent effectively joining it as a tributary. However, the Trent being the &quot;longer&quot; river at that point is considered the more senior, and so the combined river bears its name.
The catchment of the Tame covers an area of nearly 1500 km2 and contains a population of about 1.7 million people. Approximately 42% of the Tame basin is urbanised, making it the most heavily urbanised river basin in the United Kingdom.

The traditional industries of Birmingham and the Black Country, based on coal, iron and steel, were heavily polluting, and the Tame is conducted through a series of purification lakes below Lea Marston in Warwickshire to remove pollutants, an arrangement unique in the UK. A large part of this lake area forms the Kingsbury Water Park. Clean-up operations in a notoriously polluted stretch of the river in the Witton area of Birmingham have meant that aquatic wildfowl such as ducks and swans have settled on that stretch of the river. Sandwell Valley has evolved over the last two decades into an important urban wildlife habitat.

The Tame is non-navigable throughout its course.

==Pollution==
The Tame was once one of Britain&#x27;s dirtiest rivers. It is now much cleaner, due to changes in legislation and the use of purification lakes at Lea Marston.

== Flooding ==

There have been major flooding problems associated with the river. These result largely from the mainly urban character of the upper catchment. Rainfall runs off the roofs and hard surfaces, raising river levels very rapidly. Rapid housebuilding and commercial development may have exacerbated the problem in recent years. Another development contributing to worse flooding has been the general rise in groundwater levels in the upper catchment area. As traditional industries have declined and been replaced by light industries and services, far less water has been taken from the river and the underlying aquifer.

The river is susceptible to spectacular flooding at the village of Hopwas, between Tamworth and Lichfield, during periods of heavy autumnal rain. The long-term persistence of the problem is attested by the Anglo-Saxon meaning of the village&#x27;s name:- &quot;hop&quot; – nook of land, &quot;was&quot; – watery. There is also a substantial bend in the course of the river between Hopwas and Elford, giving rise to the name &quot;Tamhorn&quot; for the area.

=== Flood prevention ===
Flood prevention work was carried out on Sandwell Valley in the 1980s. Forge Mill Lake was created as a stormwater retention basin by enlarging an existing depression. The river was dredged to deepen it and the gravel used to construct an island in the lake. This evolved into part of a nature reserve, at present leased to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. At about the same time, a similar arrangement was constructed at Sheepwash Urban Park, utilising old brickworks excavations as a storm water basin to relieve flooding by the Oldbury Arm.

In 2005, the river&#x27;s alignment through Perry Hall Park in Perry Barr, Birmingham, just downstream of Sandwell Valley, was remodelled to slow the flow, alleviate flooding and create improved habitats for wildlife, as part of the SMURF (Sustainable Management of Urban Rivers and Floodplains) project.

Nonetheless, in June 2007, after heavy rain, the river burst its banks in the Witton area of Birmingham (just downstream of Perry Barr) and at Kingsbury Water Park.

In 2009, the Environment Agency held a public consultation on its proposed flood alleviation measures. Subsequently, the Environment Agency undertook £380,000-worth of improvements, mainly involving dredging and clearing of obstacles. 1000 tonnes of gravel were removed from around the Chester Road Bridge at Castle Vale and deposited further downstream to improve the fish spawning habitat. The Gravelly Hill section was relieved of 900 tonnes of silt and debris. The Oldbury Arm was cleared of debris and five weirs were removed from it to facilitate fish migration. Work under this programme continues into 2011, mainly around Water Orton.

<doc id="412488" wikidata="Q3968379" url="?curid=412488" title="Starman (Ted Knight)">
<text>Starman (Theodore Henry &quot;Ted&quot; Knight) is a fictional superhero appearing in media published by DC Comics, primarily as a member of the Justice Society of America. Created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Jack Burnley, he first appeared in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #61 (April 1941).

==Publication history==

Invited by editor Whitney Ellsworth to create a new superhero character, Burnley drew the Starman costume as a variation of Superman&#x27;s famous outfit, topped with a Buck Rogers-style helmet. Gardner Fox developed the character, and science-fiction writer Alfred Bester also contributed Starman scripts. Later in the run, Emil Gershwin wrote the stories, with art by Mort Meskin and George Roussos.

His first story in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #61 (April 1941) pitted Starman against the sinister Dr. Doog, who threatened the world with his invention, the Ultra-Dynamo.

He continued to appear in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; through #102 (Feb 1946), and &quot;All-Star Comics&quot; #8 (Dec 1941) to #23 (Winter 1944).

==Fictional character biography==
As Starman, Ted wears a caped costume of red and green topped with a helmet with a fin on the top. He uses a gravity rod (later cosmic rod) of his own invention which allows him to fly and manipulate energy.

Initially intending the rod as a power source, Ted is convinced by his cousin, Sandra Knight / Phantom Lady, to use it to fight crime. In the original 1940s stories, Starman operated out of Gotham City, but this was retconned in the 1990s to Opal City.

Starman&#x27;s first recurring villain is Mist, an elderly scientist who wields an invisibility potion. Starman&#x27;s rogues gallery also includes Astra the Astrologist, Cuthbert Cain, Dr. Doog and the Secret Brotherhood of the Electron, and the Veil.

He is a frequent ally of the FBI and a member of the Justice Society of America for much of the 1940s and, like other &quot;mystery men&quot; of the time, serves in the wartime All-Star Squadron. In 1942, Ted enlists in the U.S. Army Air Force and briefly serves as a pilot during World War II.

At this time, the love of Ted&#x27;s life is a woman named Doris Lee, who often chastises her layabout playboy boyfriend for his pretended laziness and hypochondria, unaware of Ted&#x27;s costumed persona. Doris is murdered in the late 1940s, leading Ted to suffer a nervous breakdown.

In the 1990s-era &quot;Starman&quot; series, Ted returns to active duty, partially inspired by his time-traveling son Jack. Additionally, it is revealed that he had a brief affair with the first Black Canary (Dinah Drake) in the 1960s.

Like the rest of the Justice Society, Starman spends many years in retirement following the end of the Golden Age of heroes, but returns to help mentor the team&#x27;s spiritual successors the Justice League of America. During this time, Ted Knight marries a woman named Adele Doris Drew and has two children, Jack and David. In &quot;Zero Hour: Crisis in Time!&quot;, Ted loses his slowed aging and is forced into retirement.

Ted later battles Doctor Phosphorus, whose radiation gives him terminal cancer. He is killed in battle with Mist while stopping his bomb from destroying the city.

==Powers and abilities==
Ted Knight has no natural, superhuman powers. His abilities stem from the use of his inventions, the gravity rod and the cosmic rod. These devices channel an unknown form of stellar radiation, which Ted is able to manipulate through the rod. As Starman, he possesses the ability to fly, project bursts of stellar energy, light, and heat, create force fields and simple energy constructs, and levitate objects. Extended use of the cosmic rod created a bond between it and Ted, allowing him to mentally summon the rod when separated from it.

Ted possesses a brilliant intellect, mastery of several sciences, and a gift for invention. In addition to the gravity and cosmic rods, Ted created the cosmic staff used by his son, Jack, and the cosmic converter belt worn by his JSA teammates, the Star-Spangled Kid and Stargirl.

==Other versions==
* An alternate universe variant of Ted Knight / Starman appears in &quot;&quot;. This version is an inventor and friend of Superman, Thomas Edison, and Nikola Tesla who built his cosmic rod with technology gleaned from the rocket ship that brought Superman to Earth.
* An alternate universe variant of Ted Knight, codenamed &quot;Star&quot;, appears in &quot;&quot; as an intelligence agent working at Chernobyl.
* An alternate universe variant of Ted Knight / Starman makes a cameo appearance in &quot;&quot;.

<doc id="412489" wikidata="Q1753684" url="?curid=412489" title="River Tame, Greater Manchester">
<text>The River Tame flows through Greater Manchester, England. It rises on Denshaw Moor and flows to Stockport where it joins the River Goyt to form the River Mersey.

==Sources==
The Tame rises on Denshaw Moor in Greater Manchester, close to the border with the modern metropolitan county of West Yorkshire but within the historic West Riding of Yorkshire.

==Course==
Most of the river&#x27;s catchment lies on the western flank of the Pennines. The named river starts as compensation flow (that is, a guaranteed minimum discharge) from Readycon Dean Reservoir in the moors above Denshaw. The source is a little further north, just over the county border in West Yorkshire, close to the Pennine Way. The highest point of the catchment is Greater Manchester&#x27;s highest point at Black Chew Head.

The river flows generally south through Delph, Uppermill, Mossley, Stalybridge, Ashton-under-Lyne, Dukinfield, Haughton Green, Denton and Hyde. The Division Bridge (which spans the river at Mossley), marks the meeting point of the traditional boundaries of Lancashire, Yorkshire and Cheshire. The section through Stalybridge was once mooted as a diversion route for the restoration of the Huddersfield Narrow Canal although the canal was later de-culverted along a different route. At the end of its course, the confluence with the River Goyt forms the River Mersey at Stockport.

The 19th-century industrial concentrations in the above-named urban areas resulted in the Tame being a much polluted waterway. As well as industrial pollution from the dyes and bleaches used in textile mills, effluent from specialised paper-making cigarette papers, engineering effluents, including base metal washings from battery manufacture, phenols from the huge coal-gas plant in Denton, rain-wash from roads and abandoned coal spoil heaps there was also the sewage effluent from the surrounding population. Up to two-thirds of the river&#x27;s flow at its confluence with the Goyt had passed through a sewage works. The anti-pollution efforts of the last thirty years of the 20th century resulted in the positive fauna distributions listed below.

The Centre for Ecology and Hydrology measures the flow at two points for the National River Flow Archive, at Portwood weir (Stockport) and at Broomstairs weir (Denton). Portwood weir is 1¼ miles above the confluence with the Mersey and contains the great majority of the final flow (with the exception of waste water from a concrete facility).

==Boundary line==
The river has been a border from the earliest times between the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Northumbria and Mercia. For its course after the Division Bridge in Mossley the river marks much of the historical boundary dividing Cheshire and Lancashire.

==Mouth==


The Tame joins the River Goyt at Stockport, forming the River Mersey which eventually flows into the Irish Sea just past Liverpool.

==Toponymy==
The name &quot;Tame&quot; is attached to rivers across the UK in several forms, including Thames, Thame, Taff, and Tamar, alongside two other instances of Tame. The name is Celtic in origin, but the meaning is uncertain. &quot;Dark river&quot; or &quot;dark one&quot; has been suggested, but Ekwall finds it unlikely; Mills suggests it may simply mean &quot;river&quot; (c.f. Avon, Humber, Tyne). The names of the Mersey&#x27;s co-tributaries Etherow and Goyt are equally ancient and mysterious. Mersey is an Old English name (i.e. more recent) derived from &quot;river at the boundary&quot;. The earlier name is lost: Dodgson suggests that Tame may have been the name for the whole of the Mersey.
The Metropolitan Borough of Tameside is named after the river. While it flows through the borough, the river neither rises nor finishes inside its boundaries; however, most of the built-up area alongside the river is in Tameside. 

===Fauna===
The fish species present vary along the river&#x27;s length. The lower reaches (near Reddish Vale Country Park) are home to coarse fish such as gudgeon (&quot;Gobio gobio&quot;), chub (&quot;Leuciscus cephalus&quot;), and roach (&quot;Rutilus rutilus&quot;); pike (&quot;Esox lucius&quot;) and perch (&quot;Perca fluviatilis&quot;) are also present. The upper reaches (above Ashton) support brown trout (&quot;Salmo trutta&quot;) and smaller numbers of some coarse fish. The populations are self-sustaining. Migratory fish such as Atlantic salmon and sea trout cannot navigate the river as the weir at Reddish Vale is too tall and has no fish pass. Furthermore,
* Carr Brook (from its source to the Tame)
* Diggle Brook (from Diggle Reservoir to the Tame)
* Hull Brook (Head of Lower Castleshaw Reservoir to the Tame)
* Swineshaw Brook (from the Head of Swineshaw Reservoir to the Tame)
* and the Tame (from the Head of Readycon Dean Reservoir to foot of New Years Bridge Reservoir)

are all declared as salmonid waters by statute, and as such have set physical and chemical water quality objectives.

Hull Brook is a Site of Biological Importance (SBI). Hull Brook and Castleshaw Reservoir have populations of white-clawed crayfish. The river is now clean enough in principle to support otters, but none were found in a survey in 2000–2002.

==Environment==
In 2018 a study found that the river contained the greatest amount of microplastic contamination of any river yet surveyed.

<doc id="412491" wikidata="Q5516638" url="?curid=412491" title="Gaelic nobility of Ireland">
<text>This article concerns the [[Gaels|Gaelic]] nobility of Ireland from ancient to modern times. It only partly overlaps with Chiefs of the Name because it excludes Scotland and other discussion. It is one of three groups of Irish nobility, the others being those nobles descended from the Hiberno-Normans and those granted titles of nobility in the Peerage of Ireland.

==Legal status==
By the time of the Treaty of Limerick, almost all Gaelic nobles had lost any semblance of real power in their (former) domains. Today, such historical titles have no special legal status in the Ireland, unlike in Northern Ireland, which is a part of the United Kingdom. The Republic of Ireland does not confer titles of nobility under its constitution.

From 1943 until 2003 some of the modern representatives of the Gaelic nobility obtained a courtesy recognition as Chiefs of the Name from the Irish government. The practice ended in 2003 following certain scandals (Terence Francis MacCarthy) and under concerns that it was unconstitutional. Disputed titles, as well as those for whom recognition is still pending, are not listed.

==Nobles==
Clann territories were under the rule and control of a Chief, who was elected by a system called tanistry; voted by patrilineal descendants (within three generations) of the preceding Chief. The designation as Chief was also referred to as a King (Ri), Lord (Tiarna), or Captain of his countries, all of which were roughly equivalent prior to the collapse of the Gaelic order. The concept of a hereditary &quot;title&quot; originated with the adoption of English law, the policy of surrender and regrant and the collapse of the Gaelic order during the period from approximately 1585–1610. Because all new chiefs had to come from the same patrilineal lineage, each family developed a long history of ruling within an area, which gave rise to the concept of Gaelic nobility. However, ruling titles did not necessarily pass from father to son; rather it was by election from within the patrilineal kindred and bloodshed, given the absence of criminal penalties for the death of an opponent.

All below are flatha (princes) and also descendants in the male line, however distant in some cases, from at least one historical grade of Rí, a Rí túaithe (usually a local petty king), a Ruiri (overking or regional king), or a greater Rí ruirech (king of overkings, also called a provincial king or &quot;Rí cóicid&quot;). A number of &quot;rí ruirech&quot; also became Ard Rí and their surviving princely descendants remain claimants to the long vacant, so-called High Kingship. A modern Gaelic noble may be styled a self-proclaimed flaith (prince) or tiarna (lord, count/earl). See also White Rod.

The ancient Gaelic families are divided by ancestry, sept, and by geography.

===O&#x27;Neill claimants===
Other O&#x27;Neills did not apply for recognition. The most notable of these is the Prince of the Fews, Don Carlos O&#x27;Neill, 12th Marquis of Granja. There is currently a dispute between him and the Prince of Clanaboy (above) over who is the &quot;senior,&quot; with the matter appearing unresolvable. However most recently O&#x27;Neill of Clanaboy may have gotten the upper hand in the dispute.

The O&#x27;Neills of the Fews are a 15th-century branch of the Tyrone or Ó Néill Mór line whereas the O&#x27;Neills of Clanaboy are a High Medieval line. Hence the matter is academic, both being somewhat distant from the last sovereigns of Tyrone in Ulster (to 1607), whose plentiful descendants eventually fell into comparative obscurity. Today they are known as the McShane-O&#x27;Neills, or the anglicized version- Johnson.

===O&#x27;Donnell succession===
The chosen and recognised heir apparent of the Chief of the Name, Fr. Hugh O&#x27;Donel, O.F.M., is Don Hugo O&#x27;Donnell, 7th Duke of Tetuan. Other members of the family have disputed this, most notably Fr. Hugh&#x27;s sister, Nuala Ní Dhomhnaill, who has even on television and radio disputed the exclusion from the succession process of potential female and female line claimants, but the head of the genealogically senior line has been firm in his choice of his distant cousin the Duke of Tetuan.

==Other Gaelic nobles==

===MacCarthys Mór===

The most recent claimants to the royal title of MacCarthy Mór (Prince of Desmond) are two close relatives, Barry Trant MacCarthy (Mór), now elderly (born 1931), and the younger Liam Trant MacCarthy (Mór) (born 1957). They allege to be descendants of Cormac of Dunguil, younger son of Tadhg na Mainistreach Mac Carthaigh Mór, King of Desmond (died 1426), they claim to belong to the Srugrena sept, but &quot;this is a debunked falsehood&quot;; Sean J Murphy MA who has no proof to the contrary but insists anyway, that any claimant to a Gaelic Chiefship must first be vetted and accepted by him, and that not cooperating with Mr. Murphy means a claimant must be &#x27;bogus&#x27;?. Mr. Murphy has also made several attacks on the Chief Herald of Ireland since that Office denied Mr. Murphy&#x27;s wish to have unfettered access to their archives.

===Remaining magnates===
There remain other Gaelic nobles who are not of the &quot;senior&quot; lines, but whose descent is recognised in Europe and a number of whom also hold Continental titles.
* The Count O&#x27;Donnell of Austria (O&#x27;Donell von Tyrconnell)
* The Count O&#x27;Rourke of Russia
* O&#x27;Nelly, The Count O&#x27;Nelly of Austria, Commander of the 72nd Bohemian Regiment
* George Oliver Walsh Freiherr von Wallis Fieldmarshal Count of Austria

===Additional===
* O&#x27;Donovan family
* Dál gCais
** Baron Lisle (Lysaght)
* O&#x27;Neill dynasty
** MacShane-Johnson family
* O&#x27;Connell family

<text>Starman (Jack Knight) is fictional superhero in the and a member of the Justice Society of America. He is the son of the original Starman, Ted Knight. Created by James Robinson and Tony Harris, he first appeared in &quot;Zero Hour&quot; #1 (September 1994).

==Publication history==
==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
Jack is the son of Ted Knight, who, as Starman, was a Golden Age superhero. Although as a child Jack is fascinated by his father&#x27;s heroic life, he becomes more and more rebellious as he grows older. By the time he reaches adulthood, Jack is disdainful of his father&#x27;s past. Jack&#x27;s older brother David takes over his father&#x27;s mantle, while Jack often regards the superhero role with open disdain.

Although Jack is shown as both schooled and talented in fine art, his true passion is collectibles. He eventually becomes the owner and operator of an antique and collectibles store.

Jack&#x27;s role in the family changes after David is murdered by the son of Mist, one of his father&#x27;s old arch-foes. The Mist then attempts to murder Jack as well, who narrowly escapes by using one of his father&#x27;s old gravity rods. Jack resolves to track down the Mist out of a desire to protect his father. He eventually kills Mist&#x27;s son in battle and captures both Mist and his daughter Nash, who vows revenge. Mist later succumbs to dementia after the death of his son.

===Early career===
Jack reluctantly makes a deal to become Starman if his father agrees to devote his scientific knowledge to the betterment of mankind. Jack eschews a &quot;uniform&quot;, instead opting to wear street clothes and protective goggles.

Nash returns as the new Mist and attempts to become Jack&#x27;s nemesis. She drugs and rapes Jack, with the intent of becoming pregnant. She later gives birth to Jack&#x27;s son Kyle Knight. Mist intends to raise him to hate Jack and all he stands for.

Although Jack discovers many latent heroic qualities within himself, he only fully embraces them when Nash theorizes that she and Jack are two sides of the same coin. Jack vows to prove her wrong. To do so, he travels to Hell to rescue two men he hardly knows, tries valiantly to save a friendly incarnation of Solomon Grundy, and helps prove Bulletman&#x27;s innocence when he is accused of having been a Nazi agent during World War II.

Later, Jack joins the Justice Society of America, following in his father&#x27;s footsteps. Working alongside his father&#x27;s contemporaries, Jack fights the wizard Mordru, the terrorist organization Kobra, and the time-traveler Extant. Jack has to split his time between Opal City and the JSA&#x27;s hometown of New York, making him a part-time member. He resigns from the team following his father&#x27;s death and the end of his superhero career.

Jack lives and operates out of Opal City and has a number of allies. First are the O&#x27;Dares, a family of Opal City police officers. In addition, Jack regularly receives advice from a fortune teller named Charity, who has a shop in the alleys of the Opal. Charity had appeared before in a 1970s series called &quot;Forbidden Tales of Dark Mansion&quot; where she appeared as narrator and host to self-contained stories, not unlike the numerous DC comics horror anthology series. Jack also rescues Mikaal Tomas, an alien who briefly operated in New York under the name Starman during the 1970s. Jack&#x27;s most intriguing ally is the Shade, an immortal Golden Age supervillain who aids Jack because he considers Opal City his home and wants it to remain quiet. Over time, Jack comes to question whether or not the Shade&#x27;s motives are more noble than he lets on. Jack also finds common ground with Jake &quot;Bobo&quot; Benetti, a retired super-strong bank robber from his father&#x27;s days.

===Among the Stars and Return to Earth===
During his heroic career, Jack meets and falls in love with a woman named Sadie. When she reveals that she is the sister of Will Payton, yet another hero to bear the name of Starman, he vows to set off into space to find her missing brother.

Jack first seeks help in his journey from both Captain Marvel and the Justice League of America. Finally, equipped with his father&#x27;s consciousness duplicated in a Mother Box, and joined by Mikaal Tomas, Jack sets off on an intergalactic journey. However, a chance encounter diverts Jack from his intended route, and he is lost in both time and space. He meets the Legion of Super-Heroes, counsels Jor-El (father of Superman), and then helps Adam Strange fight an invading empire. As a prisoner of the empire, Jack foments revolt to escape, working with members of the Green Lantern Corps, the Omega Men and the New Gods. Jack meets Will Payton, whose body has been merged with the mind of yet another Starman, Prince Gavyn. Together, the many Starmen work together to save Gavyn&#x27;s empire. Jack leaves Gavyn/Payton to run the empire, and returns to Earth to tell Sadie her brother&#x27;s fate.

Upon his return, Jack faces almost all of his foes in a massive battle that nearly destroys Opal City. During the battle, Jack&#x27;s father sacrifices himself to save the city. Following his father&#x27;s death, Jack undertakes one final adventure, to resolve the mystery of the last recorded Starman, the Starman of 1951. Having the answer to that final riddle, Jack retires and takes his son to live with him and Sadie in San Francisco.

==After Jack Knight==
Jack has passed his cosmic rod onto Courtney Whitmore, who calls herself &quot;Stargirl&quot; and currently operates with the JSA. Jack had an appearance in &quot;Identity Crisis&quot; #1, a non-speaking cameo, sitting next to Stargirl at Sue Dibny&#x27;s funeral.

In addition, it has been recently revealed that Manhunter (Kate Spencer) is the granddaughter of Phantom Lady, who is Ted&#x27;s first cousin once removed, making Kate Jack&#x27;s second cousin once removed.

He and the Shade were seen in a non-speaking cameo appearance, attending Green Arrow and Black Canary&#x27;s wedding in the &quot;Green Arrow/Black Canary Wedding Special&quot;.

According to &quot;Manhunter&quot; vol. 3, #23, he is still living in San Francisco.

James Robinson returned to the &quot;Starman&quot; series in January 2010 for a single issue (#81) that was a tie-in to the DC event, &quot;Blackest Night&quot;. It was one of the eight &quot;dead&quot; titles being revived for one issue. This issue did not feature Jack Knight, but instead focused on Opal City, the Shade, and a Black Lantern Starman. During the events of the issue, David&#x27;s corpse is reborn as a Black Lantern; he attacks the Shade and Hope O&#x27;Dare, and announces plans to go to San Francisco to kill Jack, but he is ultimately defeated.

In the acclaimed alternate future tale &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, Jack has a teenaged African American successor known as &quot;Stars&quot;. Though he takes his name and motif from the Star-Spangled Kid, Stars uses Jack&#x27;s cosmic staff and dresses in a similar leather jacket and bandana. Though Jack&#x27;s ultimate fate is not explicitly mentioned, Thom Kallor has replaced him as Starman in this reality.

In the alternate future of the &quot;Titans Tomorrow&quot;, Courtney has changed her name to &quot;Starwoman&quot; and now carries Jack&#x27;s trademark jacket in addition to the staff. This is based on an earlier concept introduced in &quot;Young Justice: Sins of Youth&quot; when Courtney and Jack temporarily changed roles after being turned into an adult and child, respectively.

==Powers and equipment==
Jack Knight has no superpowers. Although he has been told by Charity that he possesses the same sight as she, only to a lesser degree, he has never truly explored it. Instead, he wields a &quot;cosmic staff&quot;, a device invented by Jack&#x27;s father Ted, the original Starman. The cosmic staff utilizes the same technology as the prototype &quot;gravity rods&quot; that Ted once wielded, and which Jack used before his father created the cosmic staff for him. The cosmic staff grants Jack powers including rapid flight, levitation of objects, and energy manipulation. The staff absorbs stellar energy which can then be manipulated into defensive force fields and offensive energy blasts of incredible power. Jack can use both powers at once to protect himself from atmospheric damage in high-velocity flight. Another power of the rod, seen late in the series, is that it is capable of receiving Jack&#x27;s mental commands from a distance (this is a feature of the device, an ability to &quot;attune itself to the user&quot;, and not a power of Jack&#x27;s). At present, the staff is attuned to its current wielder, Stargirl; it seems difficult to quickly change the staff&#x27;s affiliation.

Jack is also a competent martial artist, trained primarily in jujutsu.

==Reception==
The character of Jack Knight, specifically his relationship with his father and Opal City, has been seen as an example of a &quot;new wave&quot; of DC Comics from the 1990s reviving Golden Age heroes, with an emphasis on nostalgia, legacy, and mythology building.

==In other media==
===Television===
A television series based on Jack Knight / Starman and his father Ted Knight was being developed by the creators of &quot;Smallville&quot; and &quot;Birds of Prey&quot;. Following the latter series&#x27; failure in 2003, the &quot;Starman&quot; series was described as &quot;indefinitely on hold&quot;.

===Merchandise===
* Jack Knight / Starman received two figures in the DC Direct line in 1999.
* Jack Knight / Starman received a figure in Mattel&#x27;s DC Universe Classics line.

<text>Aringay, officially the Municipality of Aringay (; ; ), is a coastal municipality in the province of La Union, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 50,380 people.

Known in Philippine History as the birthplace of revolutionary leader Diego Silang, its economy is based primarily on agriculture, producing rice, tobacco and fruit crops as economic staples. A nascent tourism industry is centered on its beach resorts. Its ethnic population is predominantly Ilocano and Christian (Roman Catholic).

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Aringay&quot; is attributed to two main theories. 

The first theory suggests that the name originated from an early settlement known as &quot;Alingay, Alinguey,&quot; or &quot;Aringuey,&quot; which thrived through gold trading along the coastal areas and the Aringay River during the 15th-16th century.

The second theory is rooted in local legend. In the early 16th century, two rival settlements existed on opposite sides of a river, each led by a chieftain. Aring, the daughter of the southern chieftain, and Ayong, the son of the northern chieftain, fell in love despite the disputes between their families. The lovers met secretly at the river, and during one fateful meeting, Aring’s boat capsized during a storm. Ayong heroically saved her, shouting &quot;“Aring-ay!”&quot; as he did. This event led to the reconciliation of their families, the union of their settlements, and the naming of the town Aringay in honor of their story.

==History==

=== Early History ===
In its early history, the town now known as Aringay was referred to as &quot;Alingay, Alinguey,&quot; or &quot;Aringuey&quot;. It was a settlement of Pangasinan people strategically located along its coastal areas, lowlands, and the banks of the Aringay River. Historically, this settlement formed part of the northern section of the ancient Pangasinan region.

Aringay played a pivotal role as a coastal maritime trading center, serving as the terminus of the Aringay-Tonglo-Balatok gold trail. This route linked the gold mines of upland Tonglo (in present-day Benguet) to lowland Aringay, facilitating the transport of gold through the nearby port-settlement of &quot;Aroo&quot; (modern-day Agoo).

The settlement flourished through trade with neighboring groups such as the Samtoy (Ilocano) communities to the north and Cordilleran (Igorot) peoples like the Ibaloi, Ifugao, and Kankanaey in the highlands of the Cordillera Central. Aringay also hosted foreign traders from China mainly from Fujian, Japan, and Maritime Southeast Asia, fostering a vibrant trade network. Goods exchanged in these transactions included porcelain, silk, cotton, beeswax, gemstones, beads, and precious minerals, particularly gold, which was highly valued both regionally and internationally.

=== Spanish Colonization ===
In June 1752, Spanish conquistador Juan de Salcedo and his soldiers arrived in Aringay during their expedition of Northern Luzon. Following the pacification of the nearby settlement of Aroo, they encountered a thriving enclave of ethnic Pangasinan people actively involved in gold trading.

The Spanish attempted to persuade the locals to pay tribute to the Crown and convert to Christianity. However, Salcedo did not establish a permanent foothold in the area, opting instead to continue his expedition northward to Vigan, which he later founded as &quot;Villa Fernandina de Vigan&quot; in honor of Prince Ferdinand, son of King Philip II.

Subsequently, Augustinian friars and Spanish authorities, led by Captain Alfonso Quirante, formally organized the settlement into a &quot;pueblo&quot;. The Spaniards imposed their authority by subjugating the locals and foreign merchants and converting them to Christianity. A &quot;visita&quot; (satellite mission station) was established in Aringay and placed under the jurisdiction of the larger church district in Agoo. New agricultural techniques and the Encomienda System were introduced, entrusting native labor and resources to Spanish encomenderos, friars, and local elites in exchange for tribute and governance.

The gold trade in Aringay eventually declined as Spanish authorities centralized the gold industry. This shift disrupted the community’s traditional way of life and reoriented its economy toward agriculture under Spanish influence.

By the 18th century, population pressures and the oppressive conditions imposed by Spanish colonial rule prompted Ilocano migrants from Ylocos provinces and neighboring towns to settle in Aringay. These settlers established communities along the mouth of the &quot;Carayan Lucsin&quot; (Aringay River), dividing into settlements on the river&#x27;s northern and southern banks. Over time, they expanded eastward, forming prosperous villages in the surrounding valleys.

On December 16, 1741, the settlement was officially organized as a municipality and named Aringay. Don Pablo Vergara served as the first &quot;gobernadorcillo&quot; under the jurisdiction of Pangasinan province and the Bishopric of Nueva Segovia. Following Spanish urban planning principles, early homes were constructed in a Renaissance grid pattern.

Under Spanish rule, Aringay thrived, with agriculture becoming the primary livelihood. The introduction of modern farming techniques improved productivity in the valleys and plains, while the fishing industry flourished, supported by species like giant carp introduced by East Asian traders. A Chinese community also developed in the town, contributing significantly to the local economy.

==== Creation of La Union ====
On October 29, 1849, Governor-General Narciso Zaldua Clavería issued a decree merging eight towns from Pangasinan, three from Ilocos Sur, and territories in the Cordillera to form the province of La Union. The establishment of the province was formalized on March 2, 1850, through the &quot;Superior Decreto&quot; signed by Governor-General Antonio María Blanco. 

Aringay was one of the founding towns, alongside San Fernando (the provincial capital), Agoo, Santo Tomas, Rosario, Tubao, Caba, Naguilian, Bauang, San Juan, Balaoan, Luna, Bangar, and Bacnotan. This formation was confirmed on April 18, 1854, by a royal decree (&quot;real orden&quot;) from Queen Isabella II of Spain. 

The towns of Caba and Gallano (later placed in the province of Benguet and then abolished in 1900) were later carved out of Aringay&#x27;s northern borders.

==== Philippine Revolution ====
During the Philippine Revolution, the residents of Aringay actively participated in the fight for independence against Spanish colonial rule. Under the leadership of General Manuel Tinio y Bondoc, a close ally of Emilio Aguinaldo, the locals engaged in significant resistance efforts in Northern Luzon.

On June 16, 1898, a fierce battle took place in the town plaza, where 96 Katipuneros lost their lives in the struggle for freedom. After months of resistance, Aringay was finally liberated from Spanish control, contributing to the Philippines’ eventual declaration of independence in 1898.

=== American Colonization ===
The independence of the Philippines from Spain was short-lived, as the Philippine-American War soon followed. In 1899, the town of Aringay in La Union became a center of resistance against American forces. Guerrilla Unit No. 5, under the leadership of &quot;Captain Fontanilla&quot;, operated in Aringay and its neighboring areas, including Agoo, Tubao, Santo Tomas, and Rosario. The guerrilla forces played a crucial role in resisting American advances and defending the town&#x27;s autonomy. On November 20, 1899, American troops arrived in La Union, leading to a decisive battle at the Aringay River, where the guerrillas inflicted significant damage on the U.S. forces. 

By 1901, La Union, including Aringay, was fully under American control. During this period, the Americans continued a railway project initially started by the Spanish colonizers. The &quot;Ferrocarril de Manila-Dagupan&quot;, which aimed to stimulate economic growth in the countryside and reduce demands for independence, was renamed the Manila Railroad Company under American management. The railway line reached Aringay in 1912. Efforts to extend the railway from Aringay to Baguio began shortly thereafter, with the Aringay segment completed in 1913. However, the project was abandoned due to financial constraints faced by the Manila Railroad Company. The tunnel constructed in Aringay remains as a historical landmark, having stood for over 105 years. Additionally, a railway bridge connecting Sta. Rita West and Poblacion in Aringay was built as part of the Manila-to-San Fernando, La Union line. 

By the 1910s, the American colonial government introduced several public services in the area. A public education system was established, with American teachers known as Thomasites sent to assimilate Filipinos into American culture. Public hospitals were also built, and a local governance system was introduced, allowing Filipinos to elect their own leaders for the first time. These developments marked significant changes in Aringay’s social, educational, and political landscape during the American occupation. 

=== Japanese Occupation ===
In December 1941, Japanese forces attacked U.S. military installations and residential areas in Aringay, La Union. By December 22, 1941, the Japanese 14th Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Masaharu Homma, landed at the mouth of Aringay River aster securing San Fernando and Bacnotan as part of their strategy to secure the Lingayen Gulf and advance their occupation of the Philippines. This event marked the beginning of the Japanese occupation in Aringay. 

During this period, the town faced strict control under the Imperial Japanese government, leading to widespread abuses, including torture, sexual slavery, and massacres of local residents. These atrocities left a lasting impact on the community and the region as a whole. 

By January 1945, American forces launched a successful campaign in the Battle of Lingayen Gulf, which marked the turning point in liberating northern Luzon from Japanese control. Aringay was officially freed in March 1945 following the Battle of Bacsil Ridge in San Fernando, La Union, which signified the full liberation of the province from Japanese occupation. 

===Possible merger with Agoo and proposed cityhood===

In 2014, La Union Second District Representative Eufranio Eriguel filed House Bill 4644, which seeks to merge the municipalities of Agoo and Aringay into a component city to be known as the City of Agoo-Aringay.

<text>Edward Ernest Hartman (August 25, 1964 – October 3, 2003) was convicted of the 1993 murder of Herman Smith Sr. and was executed via lethal injection in 2003 by the State of North Carolina at Central Prison in Raleigh, North Carolina.

Hartman confessed to the crime but requested a life sentence. According to &quot;The News &amp; Observer&quot;, five mitigating factors were presented at Hartman&#x27;s trial, including alcoholism (he claimed to be severely intoxicated at the time of the murder) and childhood abuse. The jury felt that these factors were outweighed by Hartman&#x27;s theft of Smith&#x27;s car and money. In seeking clemency, Hartman&#x27;s lawyers (along with outside groups) argued that the prosecution had used Hartman&#x27;s sexuality (he was bisexual) in a discriminatory manner, an argument rejected by the courts and by Governor Mike Easley of North Carolina.

<text>A sphygmomanometer ( ), also known as a blood pressure monitor, or blood pressure gauge, is a device used to measure blood pressure, composed of an inflatable cuff to collapse and then release the artery under the cuff in a controlled manner, and a mercury or aneroid manometer to measure the pressure. Manual sphygmomanometers are used with a stethoscope when using the auscultatory technique.

A sphygmomanometer consists of an inflatable cuff, a measuring unit (the mercury manometer, or aneroid gauge), and a mechanism for inflation which may be a manually operated bulb and valve or a pump operated electrically.

The word &quot;sphygmomanometer&quot; uses the combining form of &quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot;. The roots involved are as follows: Greek &quot;sphygmos&quot; &quot;pulse&quot;, plus the scientific term &quot;manometer&quot; (from French &quot;manomètre&quot;), i.e. &quot;pressure meter&quot;, itself coined from &quot;manos&quot; &quot;thin, sparse&quot;, and &quot;metron&quot; &quot;measure&quot;.

Most sphygmomanometers were mechanical gauges with dial faces, or mercury columns, during most of the 20th century. Since the advent of electronic medical devices, names such as &quot;meter&quot; and &quot;monitor&quot; can also apply, as devices can automatically monitor blood pressure on an ongoing basis.

== History ==
The sphygmomanometer was invented by Samuel Siegfried Karl Ritter von Basch in the year 1881. Scipione Riva-Rocci introduced a more easily-usable version in 1896. In 1901, pioneering neurosurgeon Dr. Harvey Cushing brought an example of Riva-Rocci&#x27;s device to the US, modernized and popularized it within the medical community. Further improvement came in 1905 when Russian physician Nikolai Korotkov included diastolic blood pressure measurement following his discovery of &quot;Korotkoff sounds&quot;. William A. Baum invented the Baumanometer brand in 1916, while working for The Life Extension Institute which performed insurance and employment physicals.

== Types ==
Both manual and digital meters are currently employed, with different trade-offs in accuracy versus convenience.

=== Manual ===
A stethoscope is required for auscultation (see below). Manual meters are best used by trained practitioners, and, while it is possible to obtain a basic reading through palpation alone, this yields only the systolic pressure.

* Mercury sphygmomanometers are considered the gold standard. They indicate pressure with a column of mercury, which does not require recalibration. Because of their accuracy, they are often used in clinical trials of drugs and in clinical evaluations of high-risk patients, including pregnant women. A frequently used wall mounted mercury sphygmomanometer is also known as a Baumanometer.
* Aneroid sphygmomanometers (mechanical types with a dial) are in common use; they may require calibration checks, unlike mercury manometers. Aneroid sphygmomanometers are considered safer than mercury sphygmomanometers, although inexpensive ones are less accurate. A major cause of departure from calibration is mechanical jarring. Aneroids mounted on walls or stands are not susceptible to this particular problem.

=== Digital ===
Digital meters employ oscillometric measurements and electronic calculations rather than auscultation. They may use manual or automatic inflation, but both types are electronic, easy to operate without training, and can be used in noisy environments. They calculate systolic and diastolic pressures by oscillometric detection, employing either deformable membranes that are measured using differential capacitance, or differential piezoresistance, and they include a microprocessor. They estimate mean arterial blood pressure and measure pulse rate; while systolic and diastolic pressures are obtained less accurately than with manual meters, and calibration is also a concern. Digital oscillometric monitors may not be advisable for some patients, such as those with arteriosclerosis, arrhythmia, preeclampsia, &quot;pulsus alternans&quot;, and &quot;pulsus paradoxus&quot;, as their calculations may not be correct for these conditions, and in these cases, an analog sphygmomanometer is preferable when used by a trained person.

Digital instruments may use a cuff placed, in order of accuracy and inverse order of portability and convenience, around the upper arm, the wrist, or a finger. Recently, a group of researchers at Michigan State University developed a smartphone based device that uses oscillometry to estimate blood pressure. The oscillometric method of detection used gives blood pressure readings that differ from those determined by auscultation, and vary according to many factors, such as pulse pressure, heart rate and arterial stiffness, although some instruments are claimed also to measure arterial stiffness, and some can detect irregular heartbeats.

== Operation ==

In humans, the cuff is normally placed smoothly and snugly around an upper arm, at roughly the same vertical height as the heart while the subject is seated with the arm supported. Other sites of placement depend on species and may include the flipper or tail. It is essential that the correct size of cuff is selected for the patient. Too small a cuff results in too high a pressure, while too large a cuff results in too low a pressure. For clinical measurements it is usual to measure and record both arms in the initial consultation to determine if the pressure is significantly higher in one arm than the other. A difference of 10 mmHg may be a sign of coarctation of the aorta. If the arms read differently, the higher reading arm would be used for later readings. The cuff is inflated until the artery is completely occluded.
With a manual instrument, listening with a stethoscope to the brachial artery, the examiner slowly releases the pressure in the cuff at a rate of approximately 2 mmHg per heart beat. As the pressure in the cuffs falls, a &quot;whooshing&quot; or pounding sound is heard (see Korotkoff sounds) when blood flow first starts again in the artery. The pressure at which this sound began is noted and recorded as the systolic blood pressure. The cuff pressure is further released until the sound can no longer be heard. This is recorded as the diastolic blood pressure. In noisy environments where auscultation is impossible (such as the scenes often encountered in emergency medicine), systolic blood pressure alone may be read by releasing the pressure until a radial pulse is palpated (felt). In veterinary medicine, auscultation is rarely of use, and palpation or visualization of pulse distal to the sphygmomanometer is used to detect systolic pressure.

Digital instruments use a cuff which may be placed, according to the instrument, around the upper arm, wrist, or a finger, in all cases elevated to the same height as the heart. They inflate the cuff and gradually reduce the pressure in the same way as a manual meter, and measure blood pressures by the oscillometric method.

== Significance ==
By observing the mercury in the column, or the aneroid gauge pointer, while releasing the air pressure with a control valve, the operator notes the values of the blood pressure in mmHg. The peak pressure in the arteries during the cardiac cycle is the systolic pressure, and the lowest pressure (at the resting phase of the cardiac cycle) is the diastolic pressure. A stethoscope, applied lightly over the artery being measured, is used in the auscultatory method. Systolic pressure (first phase) is identified with the first of the continuous Korotkoff sounds. Diastolic pressure is identified at the moment the Korotkoff sounds disappear (fifth phase).

Measurement of the blood pressure is carried out in the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure), and in many other healthcare scenarios.

<text>The Somali Democratic Republic (; (), ) was a socialist state in Somalia that existed from 1969 to 1991.

Established in October 1969, the Somali Democratic Republic emerged following a coup d&#x27;état led by Major General Mohamed Siyaad Barre and the Somali military. The coup took place six days after the assassination of Abdirashid Shermarke, the second President of the Somali Republic. Barre&#x27;s administration governed Somalia for the next 21 years until the rise of Ethiopian-backed Somali rebel groups, which ultimately led to the government&#x27;s collapse and the onset of civil war in 1991.

==History==
=== Coup d&#x27;etat ===
Abdirashid Shermarke, the 2nd president of Somalia, was assassinated outside the municipal headquarters of Las Anod in Northern Somalia on 15 October 1969. Shermarke had been visiting drought-stricken areas in the northeast when the assassin, Said Yusuf Ismail, shot and killed him.

Henry Kissinger, then United States National Security Advisor, concluded that the assassin acted independently. Sharmarke was elected in 1964 with support from the Soviet Union and other communist states during his campaign.

On 21 October 1969, at 3:00 a.m., General Siyaad and the military overthrew the parliamentary government. One of the primary causes of the coup was widespread corruption and mishandling of public funds within the Somali government. Consequently, many members of the police and armed forces had become disillusioned with the direction of the country.

The assassin, Ismail, was tried, tortured, and executed by the Supreme Revolutionary Council. Notably, Ismail shared the same clan background as President Shermarke.

=== Early years ===
The Supreme Revolutionary Council (SRC), which came to power following President Shermarke&#x27;s assassination, was led by Lieutenant General Salaad Gabeyre Kediye and Chief of Police Jama Ali Korshel. Kediye held the official title of &quot;Father of the Revolution&quot;, and shortly thereafter, Barre became the head of the SRC. The SRC arrested members of the former civilian government, banned political parties, dissolved the National Assembly, and suspended the constitution.

The revolutionary army initiated large-scale public works programs and successfully implemented an urban and rural literacy campaign, significantly increasing the literacy rate. In addition to a nationalization program for industry and land, the new regime&#x27;s foreign policy emphasized Somalia&#x27;s traditional and religious ties with the Arab world, leading to its membership in the Arab League (AL) in 1974. That same year, Barre also served as chairperson of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), the predecessor of the African Union (AU).

In July 1976, Barre&#x27;s SRC disbanded and established the Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party (SRSP) as a one-party government based on scientific socialism and Islamic principles. The SRSP aimed to reconcile the official state ideology with the official state religion, emphasizing Muslim principles of social progress, equality, and justice. The government argued that these principles formed the core of scientific socialism, along with a focus on self-sufficiency, public participation, popular control, and direct ownership of the means of production. While the SRSP encouraged limited private investment, the administration&#x27;s overall direction was proclaimed as socialist.

== Ogaden campaign ==
On 13 July 1977, the Ogaden War against Ethiopia erupted when Barre&#x27;s government aimed to annex the predominantly Somali-inhabited Ogaden region into a Pan-Somali Greater Somalia. This conflict was part of a broader SNA initiative to unify all Somali territories, known as Soomaaliweyn. In the first week of the war, the Somali National Army achieved remarkable victories over Ethiopian forces, surprising many American military observers who maintained a neutral stance. Southern and central Ogaden were quickly captured, and throughout much of the conflict, the Somali Army continued to defeat the Ethiopian Army, advancing as far as Sidamo. By September 1977, Somalia controlled 90% of the Ogaden, capturing strategic cities like Jijiga and exerting heavy pressure on Dire Dawa, thereby threatening the train route from that city to Djibouti. 

Following the siege of Harar, a massive and unprecedented Soviet intervention occurred, involving 20,000 Cuban troops and several thousand Soviet advisers supporting Ethiopia&#x27;s communist Derg regime. On 15 March 1978, a ceasefire was negotiated, bringing an end to the war. This shift in Soviet support prompted the Barre government to seek new allies, eventually turning to the United States, which had been courting Somalia for some time as a counter to Soviet influence. Ultimately, Somalia&#x27;s initial alliance with the Soviet Union and subsequent partnership with the United States enabled it to build the largest army in Africa.

== New constitution ==
A new Constitution was ratified on 25 August 1979 through a popular referendum, leading to elections for a People&#x27;s Assembly. This Constitution established a presidential system, wherein the president served as both the head of state and the head of government. As head of government, the president appointed the members of the Council of Ministers, which he chaired. Initially, the Constitution stipulated that the president would be elected for a six-year renewable term by a two-thirds majority vote of the legislature.

== Decline ==

After the failed Ogaden campaign, Barre&#x27;s administration began arresting government and military officials suspected of involvement in the 1978 coup attempt. Most of those believed to have participated in the plot were executed without trial. However, several officials managed to escape abroad and began forming various dissident groups aimed at forcibly removing Barre&#x27;s regime.

In 1979, a new constitution was introduced, leading to elections for a People&#x27;s Assembly. Despite this, Barre&#x27;s Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party (SRSP) continued to maintain control. In October 1980, the SRSP was disbanded, and the Supreme Revolutionary Council was re-established in its place. By this time, Barre&#x27;s government had become increasingly unpopular, and many Somalis were disillusioned with life under military dictatorship. The regime weakened further in the 80&#x27;s as the Cold War drew to a close, diminishing Somalia&#x27;s strategic importance.

The government&#x27;s totalitarian grip culminated in the Isaaq genocide (1987–1988), which devastated several major cities and targeted members of the Isaaq clan. Civilian death estimates range from 50,000 to 100,000 up to over 200,000. These brutal tactics sparked resistance movements, supported by Ethiopia, that emerged across the country and eventually led to the Somali Civil War. Among these militia groups were the Somali Salvation Democratic Front (SSDF), the United Somali Congress (USC), the Somali National Movement (SNM), and the Somali Patriotic Movement (SPM), alongside non-violent political opposition such as the Somali Democratic Movement (SDM), the Somali Democratic Alliance (SDA) and the Somali Manifesto Group (SMG).

On 26 January 1991, Barre was ousted from power, and Somalia subsequently descended into chaos.

<text>A scatter plot, also called a scatterplot, scatter graph, scatter chart, scattergram, or scatter diagram, is a type of plot or mathematical diagram using Cartesian coordinates to display values for typically two variables for a set of data. If the points are coded (color/shape/size), one additional variable can be displayed.
The data are displayed as a collection of points, each having the value of one variable determining the position on the horizontal axis and the value of the other variable determining the position on the vertical axis.

== History ==

According to Michael Friendly and Daniel Denis, the defining characteristic distinguishing scatter plots from line charts is the representation of specific observations of bivariate data where one variable is plotted on the horizontal axis and the other on the vertical axis. The two variables are often abstracted from a physical representation like the spread of bullets on a target or a geographic or celestial projection.

While Edmund Halley created a bivariate plot of temperature and pressure in 1686, he omitted the specific data points used to demonstrate the relationship. Friendly and Denis claim his visualization was different from an actual scatter plot. Friendly and Denis attribute the first scatter plot to John Herschel. In 1833, Herschel plotted the angle between the central star in the constellation Virgo and Gamma Virginis over time to find how the angle changes over time, not through calculation but with freehand drawing and human judgment.

Sir Francis Galton extended and popularized the scatter plot and many other statistical tools to pursue a scientific basis for eugenics. When, in 1886, Galton published a scatter plot and correlation ellipse of the height of parents and children, he extended Herschel&#x27;s mere plotting of data points by binning and averaging adjacent cells to create a smoother visualization. Karl Pearson, R. A. Fischer, and other statisticians and eugenicists built on Galton&#x27;s work and formalized correlations and significance testing.

== Overview ==
A scatter plot can be used either when one continuous variable is under the control of the experimenter and the other depends on it or when both continuous variables are independent. If a parameter exists that is systematically incremented and/or decremented by the other, it is called the &quot;control parameter&quot; or independent variable and is customarily plotted along the horizontal axis. The measured or dependent variable is customarily plotted along the vertical axis. If no dependent variable exists, either type of variable can be plotted on either axis and a scatter plot will illustrate only the degree of correlation (not causation) between two variables.

A scatter plot can suggest various kinds of correlations between variables with a certain confidence interval. For example, weight and height would be on the -axis, and height would be on the -axis. Correlations may be positive (rising), negative (falling), or null (uncorrelated). If the dots&#x27; pattern slopes from lower left to upper right, it indicates a positive correlation between the variables being studied. If the pattern of dots slopes from upper left to lower right, it indicates a negative correlation. A line of best fit (alternatively called &#x27;trendline&#x27;) can be drawn to study the relationship between the variables. An equation for the correlation between the variables can be determined by established best-fit procedures. For a linear correlation, the best-fit procedure is known as linear regression and is guaranteed to generate a correct solution in a finite time. No universal best-fit procedure is guaranteed to generate a correct solution for arbitrary relationships. A scatter plot is also very useful when we wish to see how two comparable data sets agree to show nonlinear relationships between variables. The ability to do this can be enhanced by adding a smooth line such as LOESS. Furthermore, if the data are represented by a mixture model of simple relationships, these relationships will be visually evident as superimposed patterns.

The scatter diagram is one of the seven basic tools of quality control.

Scatter charts can be built in the form of bubble, marker, or/and line charts.

== Example ==
For example, to display a link between a person&#x27;s lung capacity, and how long that person could hold their breath, a researcher would choose a group of people to study, then measure each one&#x27;s lung capacity (first variable) and how long that person could hold their breath (second variable). The researcher would then plot the data in a scatter plot, assigning &quot;lung capacity&quot; to the horizontal axis, and &quot;time holding breath&quot; to the vertical axis.

A person with a lung capacity of who held their breath for would be represented by a single dot on the scatter plot at the point (400, 21.7) in the Cartesian coordinates. The scatter plot of all the people in the study would enable the researcher to obtain a visual comparison of the two variables in the data set and will help to determine what kind of relationship there might be between the two variables.

== Scatter plot matrices ==
For a set of data variables (dimensions) &quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2, ... , &quot;X&quot;&quot;k&quot;, the scatter plot matrix shows all the pairwise scatter plots of the variables on a single view with multiple scatterplots in a matrix format. For variables, the scatterplot matrix will contain rows and columns. A plot located on the intersection of row and th column is a plot of variables &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; versus &quot;X&quot;&quot;j&quot;. This means that each row and column is one dimension, and each cell plots a scatter plot of two dimensions.

A generalized scatter plot matrix offers a range of displays of paired combinations of categorical and quantitative variables. A mosaic plot, fluctuation diagram, or faceted bar chart may be used to display two categorical variables. Other plots are used for one categorical and one quantitative variables.

<text>Ilyinskoye (, until 1946 Kusunai or is a rural locality (selo) in Tomarinsky District, Sakhalin Oblast, Russia.

A settlement on the western coast of Sakhalin Island, by the mouth of the Kusunai River was founded in 1853 by Dmitry Orlov, however, it was later abandoned when all Russian settlements were removed from the island due to the Crimean War. A successor settlement, known as Ilyinsky Post or Kusunai Post, was founded at the same location by Nikolay Rudanovsky on 20 August 1857. In the 1860s this was one of the two settlements on Sakhalin, along with Due, which had a permanent Russian population.

In 1906, after the Russo-Japanese War, following the Treaty of Portsmouth, the Southern Sakhalin was transferred to Japan. Ilyinskoye was renamed Kusunai and became part of Karafuto Prefecture. In 1945, following World War II, it was reoccupied by the Soviet Union. Administratively, on 2 February 1946 South Sakhalin Oblast was created, which was part of Khabarovsk Krai. Kusunai was renamed Ilyinsky, made an urban-type settlement, and included into Tomarinsky District. On 2 January 1947 South Sakhalin Oblast was abolished and merged into Sakhalin Oblast. On 1 January 2005, the urban-type settlement of Ilyinsky was downgraded to selo and renamed Ilyinskoye.

On 25 November 2019, a large power station was opened in Ilyinskoye.

<text>A circuit party is a large dance event. It extends through the night and into the following day, almost always with a number of affiliated events in the days leading up to and following the main event. Proto-circuit parties in the late 1970s, the precursors of what later became circuit parties, were called disco parties. They lasted only one evening and were held in various large venues in metropolitan areas with large gay populations.

Circuit parties were first developed in connection with the early tea dances, attended by a subset of gay men, as well as theme parties held on Fire Island and The Hamptons on Long Island. They came to resemble underground rave parties in some respects, but differ in that circuit parties are highly publicized and professionally produced, and tend to attract people from a wider age range and a broader geographic area.

==Background==

===Founding as disco parties (1970s)===

The start of the circuit has been attributed to many different parties that sprang up during the late 1970s and early 1980s. These proto-circuit parties in the late 1970s, the precursors of what later became circuit parties, were called &quot;disco parties.&quot; They lasted one evening only, and were held in various large venues in metropolitan areas with large gay populations. Although Flamingo and 12 West were Manhattan clubs that had theme-centered gay parties, these nightclubs were eclipsed by the opening of The Saint in the East Village in 1980.

The Saint, which was constructed inside the renovated space that had once housed the renowned Fillmore East theatre, featured a dome-covered dance floor, the dome being suspended in mid-air, and a complete planetarium mechanism that projected a starscape onto the dome above the dance floor. While open every weekend beginning in September, The Saint&#x27;s once monthly parties became marathon events that drew gay men from around the world. These parties created the concept of a single disco party being the focal point for a weekend getaway in the gay community.

What was to become another circuit party was founded during the same time period by Corbett Reynolds, a Columbus, Ohio-based artist and nightclub owner in the late 1970s. Initially, Reynolds envisioned a one-night party-to-end-all-parties, designed around the theme of the color Red (hence the name &quot;Red Party&quot;), which was to be held at Reynolds&#x27; nightclub, “Rudely Elegant.”

The Red Party proved to be so successful, and drew so many outside visitors, that it filled the Valley Dale Dance Hall to capacity and became an annual event, outliving the closure of the bar in the early 1980s. Reynolds was a true artist, creating complete party-scapes all in red. On the 25th anniversary of the Red Party, the theme of which was to have been &quot;Rome&quot;, Mr. Reynolds died. Those in charge of his estate thought about how, if at all, to continue the event and, in the end, decided to retire the concept of the &quot;Red Party&quot; and leave it to history.

===AIDS crisis and growth of parties (1980s–1990s)===
The early 1980s saw the start of the AIDS crisis, and entire communities were affected. Several benefit parties sprang up around the country, which were run by volunteer organizations that donated their proceeds to HIV/AIDS-related charities, such as &quot;Halloween&#x27;s in New Orleans&quot;. The success of these early parties gave way to other events hosted in other cities, with each party having its own theme. Many were named after colors, such as &quot;White Party&quot;, &quot;Black Party&quot;, &quot;Blue Ball&quot;, and &quot;Black and Blue Festival&quot;. And many center around other events, such as &quot;Southern Decadence&quot; and the Folsom Street Fair. Dance parties provided an environment in which gay men processed the experience of HIV/AIDS and served to build particular forms of communal response to the epidemic 
One economic reality of a well-run circuit party is that the event can bring large amounts of tourist dollars to the locality where the event is held. Because of their economic impact, Circuit parties have been welcomed in some of the more liberal cities where they are held.

In the early 1990s, as more and more gay men became attracted to these mega dance-events, the real modern-day circuit party scene emerged and expanded into ever-larger productions, featuring superstar DJs and performers. Promoters sometimes turned events from one party into a major series of parties at various venues, transforming a weekend into a three-day or longer continuous party. For example, a pool party might go from noon to 5PM, a &quot;t-dance&quot; from 5PM to 9PM, a main event from 9PM to 4AM, and an after-hours party from 4AM until 12 noon, after which the cycle repeats itself.

To keep putting together these increasingly elaborate and costly productions, the prices (cover charge) of circuit parties increased greatly, so that it was not uncommon for a ticket covering the full weekend of parties to cost $400 or more.

===Peak and decline in popularity (2000s)===
Having reached its peak around 1999–2000 (as evidenced by the total number of events during those years, and the steady decline in the number of events since), the Circuit found itself a smaller part of a much larger whole. In 2004, &quot;The New York Times&quot; travel section featured an in-depth look at The White Party in Palm Springs in conjunction with staff members of &quot;Noizemag&quot;. The central focus was to determine why thousands of men spend multi-thousands of dollars to travel to this yearly event. Taken from the viewpoint of an experienced (female) raver, this gave the mainstream a view into what makes Circuit Parties so compelling for many and highlighted many of the changes taking place in these commercial events.

Nonetheless, the downward trend continued through the entire decade, with the downfall of a dozen events such as The Red Party, FireBall, Hotlanta, The Morning Party, Hell Ball, Reunion, and Motorball.

In the early 2000s, promoters became worried as attendance decreased dramatically at many circuit events. This decline in attendance was attributed to several factors. The original circuit audience that began attending the circuit parties of the &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s had grown older and no longer had such an active interest in multi-day partying. The communal experience of HIV/AIDS changed in the context of the availability of more effective treatments. In addition, all-gay cruises, which attract upwards of 1,500 passengers, have had a dramatic impact on the attendance at circuit parties.

Much had been said about the decline of the Circuit in recent years. Some parties have disappeared from the landscape. But the scene continues to thrive in many places with attendance rebounding from the dip that occurred after the new Millennium. This is especially true at the better produced events, like Black and Blue in Montreal, and events that have more than just a circuit party to offer, such as Southern Decadence weekend in New Orleans. Also, all-gay cruises that carry upwards of 2,000 passengers on week-long excursions to popular travel destinations continue to be very popular.

===Recent resurgence (2010-present)===
Circuit parties are currently organized in many international cities, each of them having another leading company, such as Matinee in Barcelona and WE Party Madrid.

Circuit parties seem to have gained widespread popularity again. This resulted in the annually organized Circuit Festival by the Matinée Group since 2008. Circuit Festival is currently the biggest international gay and lesbian event, hosting more than 50 DJs every year during twelve days of circuit parties, bringing together all leading international circuit brands in Barcelona. Since 2012 it has attracted an increasing number of gay visitors of over 70,000 per edition.

Circuit parties in the United States experienced a notable resurgence in the 2010s and consistently attract large crowds of gay men. In 2017, VICE News described them as parties &quot;where gay men seek sex and freedom.&quot;

== Culture and controversy ==

Observers within the gay and medical communities have published concerns about the culture of circuit parties, particularly the high use of drugs and mood changers including: alcohol, marijuana, methamphetamine, ecstasy, ketamine, GHB, amyl nitrite, and other &quot;party drugs&quot;. It is common for circuit party promoters to hire medical professionals to be stationed outside venues in anticipation of drug overdoses, dehydration, or alcohol poisoning during an event. Also observers point to the risks of overdose and impaired judgment leading to more condomless sex and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) (see &quot;Sexual Ecology&quot;). Circuit parties have been blamed for the spread of substance abuse and the rise in transmission of STDs, particularly HIV, among gay men.

==Overview and media perception==
While open to anyone, the parties are generally viewed as social events primarily for physically fit and masculine-identified white gay men. Circuit parties charge admission, with some being run for-profit and others benefiting charities, generally those that benefit the LGBTQ communities or HIV/health related programs. Circuit parties can be expensive and lavish affairs with elaborate lighting, music, productions, decor, and are held in venues that can accommodate large crowds.

Circuit parties are known to attract a broad range of ages, from young gay men in their early 20s to those in their 40s, 50s and even 60s, and both single gay men and couples in long-term relationships. The parties are described by attendees as very important social events, analogous to a major holiday for some in the gay community. They can be described as a &quot;celebration&quot; of gay life and gay sexuality, an expression of freedom, and as a statement of the power and strength of the gay community.

Circuit parties are often perceived by outsiders as highly superficial; moreover those who attend them are often the target of broad and negative judgments by others in the gay community, usually because of the high amount of promiscuous sex and drug use that is often perceived to be associated with the events. A small body of empirical research from different research groups does, indeed, point to a high prevalence of drug use among people who attend circuit events during the course of the events and raises questions about an association between drug use and risky sex practices among gay and bisexual men Circuit parties frequently host celebrity performers or headliners, usually gay icons.

Men who frequent circuit parties and embody stereotypes affiliated with the typical attendee are often referred to as &quot;circuit queens.&quot; The term can be used in a derogatory or humorous manner depending on the context.

<text>Information and Content Exchange (ICE) is an XML-based protocol used for content syndication via the Internet. By using XML both sender and receiver have an agreed-upon language in which to communicate. Using a client–server architecture, ICE defines a syndicate/subscribe model that is comparable to the binary publish/subscribe protocol standards used in CORBA and DCOM. However, in ICE messages are delivered through XML, typically over an HTTP connection, rather than through a lower-level binary protocol.

==History==
The first standard specifically for web syndication, ICE was proposed by Firefly Networks and Vignette in January 1998. The two companies ceded control over the specification to the ICE consortium, which consisted of an authoring group and an advisory council. The ICE Authoring Group included Microsoft, Adobe, Sun, CNET, National Semiconductor, Tribune Media Services, Ziff Davis and Reuters, amongst others, and was limited to thirteen companies. The ICE advisory council included nearly a hundred members.

ICE was submitted to the World Wide Web Consortium standards body on October 26, 1998, and showcased in a press event the day after. The standard failed to benefit from the open-source implementation that W3C XML specifications often received.

Version 1.1 of the protocol was published on July 1, 2000. Version 2.0 featured improved web service support and was released on August 1, 2004. No further versions have appeared since.

Vignette had a demo version of an ICE-capable server named Site-to-Site in February 1998, aiming to show how the protocol could facilitate content exchange between websites. Site-to-site was initially scheduled for release in summer 1998; it was launched under the name Vignette Syndication Server on February 22, 1999. Through Syndication Server, Vignette became the primary ICE vendor.

In June 1999, Vignette invested $14 million in the leading web syndicator iSyndicate to adopt Vignette StoryServer for further development of the iSyndicate website. As part of the deal iSydicate committed to making all of its content available in the ICE protocol. 

Comparable XML specifications include WDDX, NITF, XMLNews, NewsML, and PRISM, as well as CDF, RSS, Atom, and Open Content Syndication (OCS).

== Implementations ==
TwICE is a Java implementation of ICE 2.0.
Rice is a Ruby implementation of ICE 1.1. Both TwICE and Rice are developed and maintained by Jim Menard.

ICEcubes is the original Java reference implementation of ICE 1.1, although it has not been actively maintained since December, 2000.

<doc id="412558" wikidata="Q858302" url="?curid=412558" title="Car Wheels on a Gravel Road">
<text>Car Wheels on a Gravel Road is the fifth studio album by American singer-songwriter Lucinda Williams, released on June 30, 1998, by Mercury Records. The album was recorded and co-produced by Williams in Nashville, Tennessee and Canoga Park, California, and features guest appearances by Steve Earle and Emmylou Harris.

Universally acclaimed by critics, &quot;Car Wheels on a Gravel Road&quot; was voted as the best album of 1998 in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll, and ranked No. 98 on the 2020 revision of &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. It won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album in 1999, and earned Williams an additional nomination for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance for the single &quot;Can&#x27;t Let Go&quot;. The album peaked at No. 68 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and remained on the chart for over five months, eventually becoming Williams&#x27; first album to be certified Gold by the RIAA. It remains Williams&#x27; best-selling album to date, with 872,000 copies sold in the US alone, as of October 2014. Additionally, it was certified Silver in the UK on July 22, 2013.

==Background==
In 1992, Lucinda Williams released her fourth album, &quot;Sweet Old World&quot;, on Chameleon Records. To support the album, Williams went on an Australian concert tour with Rosanne Cash and Mary Chapin Carpenter. While on tour, Carpenter recorded a cover of Williams&#x27; 1988 song &quot;Passionate Kisses&quot;. The cover reached number four on the Hot Country Songs chart and won a Grammy Award for Best Country Song. The popularity of &quot;Passionate Kisses&quot; and subsequent covers of Williams&#x27; other songs from musicians like Emmylou Harris and Tom Petty brought Williams a newfound level of attention, and her next album became highly anticipated within the country music scene.

==Recording==

Chameleon Records folded after the release of &quot;Sweet Old World&quot;, so Williams signed with American Recordings. The initial recording sessions for &quot;Car Wheels on a Gravel Road&quot; lasted from February to March 1995 in Austin, Texas, with longtime producer Gurf Morlix. Williams was unhappy with her vocals in these sessions, and decided to start the entire album from scratch. &quot;I was trying to grow. I didn&#x27;t want to make another &quot;Sweet Old World&quot;&quot; said Williams. Morlix believes ninety percent of the album was finished when Williams made her decision. Recording sessions resumed later that year in Nashville, Tennessee.

During this period, Williams was invited to sing backing vocals for the Steve Earle song &quot;You&#x27;re Still Standing There&quot;. Earle was working with producer Ray Kennedy, who accentuated Earle&#x27;s vocals. Williams liked this style of production, and asked Earle and Kennedy to rerecord several of the songs she was unhappy with. Morlix was infuriated by this decision, and resented the two new producers. According to Williams: &quot;Those guys all started vibin&#x27; each other, and I&#x27;m goin&#x27;, &#x27;Can we just get this record made, please?&quot; By this point, the relationship between Williams and Morlix was irremediable, and Morlix stepped down as producer. Morlix remained on the project as a guitarist, but was not credited as a producer.

With Earle and Kennedy now serving as full-time producers, the recording sessions recommenced in the summer of 1996 in Nashville. These sessions were recorded on a Telefunken V76 microphone preamplifier connected to a twenty-four track tape recorder. For the first time in Williams&#x27; career, she recorded the songs live with her backing band, as opposed to recording each instrument and vocal take individually. Kennedy said: &quot;That&#x27;s why it became such a great record—because it was so super-charged with her great vocal, which she had never really tried before.&quot; Kennedy did not include reverberation, and instead induced compression from a 1176 Peak Limiter. The recording sessions lasted around ten days, after which Kennedy added overdubs. Kennedy overdubbed many of the instruments, including the acoustic and electric guitars, keyboards, tambourines, and backing vocals.
Williams described herself as insecure while recording &quot;Car Wheels on a Gravel Road&quot;, and was intimidated by Earle&#x27;s demeanor. Tensions between the two began to emerge towards the end of the sessions, although Earle says this was simply because he knew he would eventually have to go back on tour and leave. In the years after the album&#x27;s release, Earle was misquoted as saying &quot;Car Wheels on a Gravel Road&quot; was &quot;the least amount of fun I&#x27;ve had working on a record.&quot; Earle believes the misquote likely arose from a radio interview in which he mentioned his frustration at having to leave right before the album was finished. &quot;This is one of the things people think they know what they&#x27;re talking about. So, that&#x27;s all there is to that&quot; said Earle.

When Earle left to finish his tour, the majority of the album was finished, although Williams still wanted to add harmonies to some of the songs. Earle was under the impression that once the tour ended, he would return and work on the remaining songs. Instead of waiting for the tour to end, Williams hired musician Roy Bittan, who took the rough mixes to Los Angeles, California. Bittan added organ and accordion instrumentation to eight of the songs, and made separate overdubs to the guitars. Some additional singers were brought in to add backing harmonies, such as Emmylou Harris and Jim Lauderdale. Jim Scott served as the audio mixer, and worked on an AMS Neve console and two Studer tape recorders. Scott took on a minimalist approach to mixing, as he wanted Williams&#x27; vocals and guitar to be the most prominent aspect of the album. &quot;So if you&#x27;re going to play bass, guitar and drums along with her, you&#x27;re going to play like she sings&quot; said Scott. The process took a couple of weeks, after which it was mastered at MasterMix studios in Nashville, in the midst of the 1998 tornado outbreak.

==Music and lyrics==
&quot;Car Wheels on a Gravel Road&quot; explores a variety of music genres, including country, pop, blues, and folk. Two genres commonly associated with &quot;Car Wheels on a Gravel Road&quot; are Americana and alternative country, although Williams argues that Americana did not formally exist until the creation of the Americana Music Honors &amp; Awards in 2002. According to Williams: &quot;Before that, there was alternative country and alternative rock. [Americana] was creeping in there already.&quot; Andy Greene of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; notes that the overall sound of &quot;Car Wheels on a Gravel Road&quot; differed from the prevailing trend in country music at the time, which was to incorporate more pop influences, as evidenced by the commercial success of Shania Twain&#x27;s 1997 album &quot;Come On Over&quot;.

Steve Huey of AllMusic believes that &quot;Car Wheels on a Gravel Road&quot; features the cleanest production of any album in Williams&#x27; career. Huey wrote: &quot;Its surfaces are clean and contemporary, with something in the timbres of the instruments (especially the drums) sounding extremely typical of a late-&#x27;90s major-label roots-rock album.&quot; Earle and Kennedy&#x27;s style of production favored mellow grooves for Williams to sing atop, which was greatly influenced by hip hop of the early 1990s. Some songs like &quot;2 Kool 2 Be 4-Gotten&quot; feature hip hop drum beats, and the original version of &quot;Joy&quot; featured a direct-drive turntable. Earle noted the hip hop style of production arose from a desire to experiment.

The lyrics of &quot;Car Wheels on a Gravel Road&quot; evoke imagery of Williams&#x27; life while living in the Deep South. Williams mentions various Southern cities like Jackson, Mississippi and Lafayette, Louisiana, and discusses events that occurred in nondescript locations like backroads and dilapidated shacks. Jenn Pelly of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote: &quot;Williams was mapping directions home. But home, never fixed to one place, was a profound in-between, more like the breeze that pushed her. &quot;Car Wheels&quot; is a raw, exquisite travelogue of her American South.&quot;

Love and heartbreak are important lyrical themes on &quot;Car Wheels on a Gravel Road&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Car Wheels on a Gravel Road&quot; was finished by the summer of 1997, but its release was delayed when Rubin entered negotiations to switch the distribution of American Recordings albums from Warner Bros. Records Inc. to Sony Music Entertainment Inc.. This left Williams without a label. Eventually, Williams&#x27; manager Frank Callari called Rubin and convinced him to sell the masters to another label. The masters were purchased by Danny Goldberg of Mercury Records for $450,000.

By this point, Williams had been working on &quot;Car Wheels on a Gravel Road&quot; for nearly three years, and fans were growing impatient. Fans and music journalists blamed the lengthy recording process on Williams&#x27; perfectionism, and the album became a running joke on online music forums. In September 1997, &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; published a damning article on Williams, which portrayed her as an incompetent and stubborn musician. This portrayal was strengthened when the article took an out of context quote by Callari, who described her as a &quot;bowl of corn flakes.&quot; Williams was dismayed by how the media chose to focus on the behind the scenes issues plaguing the album&#x27;s release as opposed to the music itself. Some journalists felt the detractions against Williams were sexist, as male artists known for their perfectionism like Bruce Springsteen and John Fogerty did not receive the same negative treatment for lengthy recording sessions.

&quot;Car Wheels on a Gravel Road&quot; was released by Mercury Records on June 30, 1998. It debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number sixty-five, and sold 21,000 copies in its first week.

== Critical reception and legacy ==

&quot;Car Wheels on a Gravel Road&quot; was met with widespread critical acclaim. Reviewing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; in July 1998, David Browne found Williams&#x27; hard-edged evocations of Southern rural life refreshing amid a music market overrun by timid, mass-produced female artists. Richard Cromelin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said her &quot;resonant, resolute and reassuring&quot; answers to the questions romantic passion and pain pose are as ambitious as the &quot;rich&quot;, commanding sound she crafted with producers Steve Earle and Ray Kennedy. &quot;NME&quot; magazine said Williams transfigures &quot;American roots rock into a heady, soul-baring and, would you believe, unabashedly sexy art form&quot;, while &quot;Uncut&quot; credited the album with &quot;repositioning country-blues roots rock as contemporary Southern art&quot; and offering listeners &quot;a sense of life and place that leap from every line and guitar lick&quot;. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau argued at the time that she proves herself to be the era&#x27;s &quot;most accomplished record-maker&quot; by honing traditional popular music composition, understated vocal emotions, and realistic narratives colored by her native experiences and values:

At the end of 1998, &quot;Car Wheels on a Gravel Road&quot; was named one of the year&#x27;s best albums in many critics&#x27; top-ten lists. It topped the annual Pazz &amp; Jop poll and earned Williams a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album, although AllMusic&#x27;s Steve Huey later said it was her &quot;least folk-oriented record&quot;.

&quot;Car Wheels on a Gravel Road&quot; has also been praised in retrospective appraisals. In a five-star review, About.com&#x27;s Kim Ruehl credited the album with solidifying Williams&#x27; status as one of the best singer-songwriters of all time, as she &quot;single-handedly marries the genres of traditional and alternative country, roots rock and American folk music so smoothly, it almost feels like magic.&quot; In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine called the record an alternative country masterpiece and ranked it No. 304 on their list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and ranked it No. 305 in 2012 revised list. In September 2020, Rolling Stone updated its Top 500 albums of all-time list, which reflected an updated and diverse judging pool, and the album rose to No. 98 on that list. In &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), David McGee and Milo Miles said it is a masterpiece of timeless quality and greater depth than anything else by Williams, who offers a perfect collection of &quot;faces, fights, keening swamp guitar and sighing accordion, strong drink and stronger lust in an album about places shadowed by memory&quot;. The music writers of The Associated Press voted it one of the ten best pop albums of the 1990s. It was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot; and in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000), in which it was voted No. 836. Christgau later named it among his 10 best albums from the 1990s.

Some journalists have credited &quot;Car Wheels on a Gravel Road&quot; with popularizing Americana music, and defining parameters that would eventually becomes stapes within the genre. Stephen L. Betts of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote: &quot;[&quot;Car Wheels on a Gravel Road&quot;] genesis coincides with the birth of the Americana radio format and with masterful nods to country, blues and rock, the finished product, released in June 1998, reflects the cornerstones of that burgeoning movement.&quot; Edd Hurt of &quot;Nashville Scene&quot; gave similar commentary, and said: &quot;&quot;Car Wheels&quot;, like similar Americana albums of the time (&quot;Fight Songs&quot; by Old 97&#x27;s, for instance), defined the genre as a space in which disparate elements of American music could combine to inspire work that only seemed folkish and unstudied.&quot;
