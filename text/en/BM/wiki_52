<text>Polish cuisine ( ) is a style of food preparation originating in and widely popular in Poland. Due to Poland&#x27;s history, Polish cuisine has evolved over the centuries to be very eclectic, and shares many similarities with other national cuisines. Polish cooking in other cultures is often referred to as à la polonaise.

Polish cuisine is rich in meat, especially pork, chicken and game, in addition to a wide range of vegetables, spices, fungi and mushrooms, and herbs. It is also characterised by its use of various kinds of pasta, cereals, kasha and pulses. In general, Polish cuisine makes extensive use of butter, cream, eggs, and seasoning. Traditional dishes often demand lengthy preparation. Many Poles take time to serve and enjoy their festive meals, especially Christmas Eve dinner () on December 24, or Easter breakfast, both of which could take several days to prepare.

Among popular Polish national dishes are , , , (pork loin breaded cutlet), (stuffed cabbage leaves), (roulade), (sour cucumber soup), (mushroom soup), (tomato soup), (meat broth), (sour rye soup), (tripe soup), and red beetroot soup .

A traditional Polish dinner is composed of three courses, beginning with a soup like the popular broth or tomato soup. In restaurants, soups are followed by an appetizer such as herring (prepared with either cream, oil, or in aspic), or other cured meats and chopped raw vegetable salads. The main course usually includes meat, such as a roast, breaded pork cutlet, or chicken, with a coleslaw-like (), shredded root vegetables with lemon and sugar (carrot, celeriac, cooked beetroot), sauerkraut, or salad. The side dishes are usually boiled potatoes, , or less commonly, rice. Meals often conclude with a dessert of either a fruit compote, , a poppy seed pastry, mille-feuille, or (cheesecake).

Internationally, if a Polish culinary tradition is used in other cuisines, it is referred to as &quot;à la polonaise&quot;, from the French, meaning &#x27;Polish-style.&#x27; In French cuisine, this term is used for techniques like using butter instead of cooking oil; frying vegetables with buttered breadcrumbs; using minced parsley and boiled eggs (Polonaise garnish); and adding horseradish, lemon juice, or sour cream to sauces like velouté.

==History==

===Middle Ages===
Polish cuisine in the Middle Ages was based on dishes made of agricultural produce and cereal crops (millet, rye, wheat), meats of wild and farm animals, fruits, forest fungi, berries and game, honey, herbs, and local spices. It was known above all for abundant use of salt from Wieliczka Salt Mine and permanent presence of groats (). A high calorific value of dishes and drinking beer or mead as a basic drink was typical of Middle Ages Polish cuisine.

During the Middle Ages Polish cuisine was heavy and spicy. Two main ingredients were meat (both game and beef) and cereal. The latter consisted initially of proso millet, but in the Late Middle Ages other types of cereal became widely used. Most country people did not eat bread but consumed cereals in the form of or various types of flatbread. Some of these (for instance ) are considered traditional recipes even in the 21st century. Apart from cereals, a large portion of the daily diet of mediaeval Poles consisted of pulses, mostly broad beans and peas. As the territory of Poland was densely forested, usage of fungi, forest berries, nuts, and wild honey was also widespread. Among the delicacies of the Polish nobility were honey-braised bear paws served with horseradish-flavoured salad, smoked bear tongue, and bear bacon (bears are now protected in Poland).

Owing to close trade relations with Turkey and the countries in the Caucasus, the price of spices (such as black pepper and nutmeg) was much lower in Poland than the rest of Europe, hence spicy sauces became popular. The usage of two basic sauces, the and (meaning &quot;red&quot; and &quot;gray blood&quot; in Old Polish), remained widespread at least until the 18th century.

Daily beverages included milk, whey, buttermilk, and various herbal infusions. The most popular alcoholic beverages were beer and mead; however, in the 16th century, upper classes began to import Hungarian and Silesian wines. Mead was so widespread that in the 13th century Prince Leszek I the White explained to the Pope that Polish knights could not participate in a crusade as there was no mead in the Holy Land. Also, vodka became popular, possibly among the lower classes first. There is written evidence suggesting that vodka originated in Poland. The word &quot;vodka&quot; was recorded for the first time ever in 1405 in , the court documents from the Palatinate of Sandomierz in Poland. At that time, the word (vodka) referred to chemical compounds such as medicines and cosmetic cleansers, while the popular beverage was called (from the Old Polish ).

===Renaissance===
The Italian-born Queen Bona Sforza (second wife of Sigismund I of Poland), brought Italian cooks with her court to Poland after 1518. Although native vegetable foods were an ancient and intrinsic part of Polish cuisine, there began a period in which vegetables like lettuce, leeks, celeriac, cabbage, carrots, onions (cipolla/cebula) and especially, tomatoes (pomo d&#x27;oro/pomidory), were introduced. Even today, some of those vegetables are referred to in Polish as , a word derived from , the Polish name of Italy. During this period, the use of spices — which arrived in Poland via Western Asian trade routes was common among those who could afford them, and dishes considered elegant could be very spicy. However, the idea that Queen Bona was the first to introduce vegetables to Poland is false. While her southern cooks may have helped elevate and expand the role of various vegetables in royal Polish cuisine, records show that the court of king Jogaila (, who died in 1434, over 80 years before her reign) enjoyed a variety of vegetables including lettuce, beets, cabbage, turnip, carrots, peas, and cauliflower.
Polish-style pickled cucumber () is a variety developed in the northern part of Central Europe. It was exported worldwide and is found in the cuisines of many countries. It is usually preserved in wooden barrels. A cucumber only pickled for a few days is different in taste (less sour) than one pickled for a longer time and is called (). Another kind of pickled gherkin popular in Poland is (), which is preserved with vinegar rather than pickled and uses different spices creating a sweet and sour taste, and well-known in Jewish cuisine.

The court of Queen Bona followed the Italian fashion, because she exclusively employed Italian chefs, some of whom were originally hired to prepare parties for aristocratic families but who were soon serving typical Italian dishes as part of the court&#x27;s daily menu. Court records show that Queen Bona imported large volumes of southern European, American, and Western Asian fruits (oranges, lemons, pomegranates, olives, figs, tomatoes), vegetables (potatoes and corn), nuts (chestnuts, raisins, and almonds, including marzipan), along with grains (such as rice), cane sugar, and Italian olive oil. The court also imported various herbs and spices including black pepper, fennel, saffron, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, and cinnamon.

===The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth===

Until the Partitions perpetrated by the neighboring empires, Poland was one of the largest countries in the world, and encompassed many regions with its own, distinctive culinary traditions. Two consecutive Polish kings, Władysław IV and John II Casimir () married the same French Duchess, Marie Louise Gonzaga (), daughter of Charles I, Duke of Mantua; she was persecuted by King Louis XIII of France for her affiance to his opponent Gaston, Duke of Orléans. Marie Louise arrived in Warsaw in 1646, was widowed, and married again in 1649. Ludwika brought along with her a court full of Frenchmen including courtiers, secretaries, army officers, physicians, merchants, craftsmen, as well as many cooks.

Records show that her visiting guests were entertained with game, fowl (waxwings, fieldfares, snow bunting, hazel grouse, partridges, black grouse, capercaillies), fish and mollusks (loach, various trout, grayling, fresh and smoked salmon, flounder, salted herring, lampreys in vinegar, oysters, snails), and Genoese pâté, not to mention fresh fruit and chestnuts. French and Italian wines were served, as well as mead and local beers. These dishes were made only according to French recipes. The royal court, with all its innovations, exerted a broad influence over the rest of aristocratic residences and noble palaces across Poland. French cuisine was in fashion and many families willingly employed French cooks and patissiers. In the mid-18th century, French champagne appeared on Polish tables.

Among the most influential regional cuisines under the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth were Lithuanian, Jewish, German, and Hungarian cuisine, as well as Armenian cuisine, which arrived in Poland before the 17th century along with many settlers, especially in the south-eastern part of the Commonwealth. Signature dishes of Western Asia reached Polish tables thanks to the Armenian trade and cultural exchange with Poland&#x27;s neighbor: the Ottoman Empire. Rare delicacies were brought to royal court as gifts from sultans and royal envoys. The strongest influences were noted in the cities of Lwów, Kraków, Kamieniec Podolski, and Zamość due to many Armenians living there permanently. Also, because of the close contact with the Ottoman Empire, coffee () and boza became popular.

With the subsequent decline of Poland, and the grain crisis that followed The Swedish Deluge, potatoes began to replace the traditional use of cereals. The oldest surviving Polish cookbook, &quot;Compendium ferculorum, albo Zebranie potraw&quot; (&quot;Collection of Dishes&quot;) by Stanisław Czerniecki was published in Kraków in 1682. Under the Partitions, the cuisine of Poland became heavily influenced by cuisines of surrounding empires. This included Russian and German cuisines, but also the culinary traditions of most nations of the Austro-Hungarian empire. The 19th century also saw the creation of many Polish cookbooks, by Jan Szyttler, Anna Ciundziewicka, Wincenta Zawadzka, Lucyna Ćwierczakiewiczowa, and others.

===After World War II===

After the end of World War II, Poland became a communist country which joined the Warsaw Pact. Some restaurants were nationalized. The communists envisioned a network of lunch rooms called &quot;bufet&quot; for the workers at various companies, and milk bars for the public. The majority of restaurants that survived the 1940s and 1950s were state-owned. Workplace canteens promoted mostly inexpensive meals, including soups, meatballs and pork chops, and staples such as / (potato pancakes), (apple pancakes), (potato gnocchi), (farmer&#x27;s cheese gnocchi served as a sweet), and pierogi. A typical second course consisted of meat cutlet served with potatoes or buckwheat and (raw, julienned vegetables). The popular Polish is a breaded cutlet similar to the Austrian Wiener schnitzel and the Italian and Spanish Milanesa.

With time, the shortage economy led to scarcity of meat, coffee, tea, and other basic ingredients. Many products like chocolate, sugar, and meat were rationed, with a specific limit depending on social class and health requirements. Physical workers and pregnant women were generally entitled to more food products. Imports were restricted, so much of the food supply was domestic. Cuisine became homogeneous, to be a chef was no longer a prestigious profession, and for decades the country became basically disconnected from any foreign cuisine. Tropical fruits (such as citrus, banana, and pineapple) were available during holidays, while local fruits and vegetables were mostly seasonal but were available at private stands. For most of the year, people had to get by with only domestic winter fruit and vegetables: apples, plums, currants, onions, potatoes, cabbage, root vegetables, and frozen products. Other food products (of foreign origins) were seldom available at markets at high prices.

This situation led in turn to gradual replacement of traditional Polish cuisine with food prepared from anything available at the time. Among popular dishes introduced by public restaurants were (meatballs), a sort of hamburger often served with beetroot puree and raw carrots. The traditional recipes were mostly observed during the feast (Christmas Eve), for which many families tried to prepare 12 traditional courses.

A popular form of fish dish was, and still is, the paprikash () from the port city of Szczecin, usually added to sandwiches as a spread.
===Modern era===
With the fall of communism in Poland in 1989, a wave of new restaurants opened, and basic foodstuffs were once again readily obtainable. This led to a gradual return of the rich traditional Polish cuisine, both in home cooking and in restaurants. At the same time, restaurants and supermarkets promoted the use of ingredients typical of other cuisines of the world. Among the most notable foods to become commonplace in Poland were cucurbits, zucchini, and many kinds of fish. During communist times, fresh fish was available essentially only in the seaside towns.

Recent years have seen the advent of the slow food movement, and a number of TV programmes devoted to cooking, both traditional and modern, have gained in popularity. In 2011, a nostalgic cookbook (written in English) combining a child&#x27;s memories growing up in the Gierek era with traditional Polish recipes was published in London.

American fast food in Poland, often McDonald&#x27;s, KFC, and Pizza Hut, are in decline as Polish people prefer their own cuisine, including fast food. Meanwhile, doner kebabs are gaining popularity. Nonetheless, in most of Poland one can still get traditional and very popular Polish street food such as the , a pizza-like baguette with cheese, mushrooms, onion, ketchup, and sometimes meat. There are also many small-scale, quick-service restaurants which serve kebabs, hamburgers, hot dogs, and Polish (sausage). In the southern mountainous region, served with cranberry jam is a popular street food.

In a 2023 survey on &quot;100 Best Cuisines in the World&quot; conducted by TasteAtlas, Polish cuisine was ranked 11th.

==Holiday meals==
===Christmas dishes===
Traditional Christmas Eve dinner called is meat free, though with fish and usually consists of (borscht) with uszka (small dumplings)—a classic Polish Christmas Eve starter—followed by dishes such as fried carp or cod with apple, leeks and raw salads.

Other popular dishes, eaten on ensuing days, include pickled matjas herring, rollmops, pierogi with sauerkraut and forest mushrooms, fish soup, kielbasa, hams, bigos (savory stew of cabbage and meat), and vegetable salads. Among popular desserts are gingerbread, cheesecake, various fruits such as oranges, poppy seed cake, ( in Silesia), fruit kompot, and with poppyseed and gingerbread.

===Fat Thursday===
, or &quot;Fat Thursday&quot;, is a Polish culinary custom on the last Thursday before Lent, equivalent to Pancake Day. Traditionally, it is an occasion to enjoy sweets and cakes before the forty days of abstinence expected of Catholics until Easter Day.

The most popular sweetmeats on &#x27;Fat Thursday&#x27; are , Polish doughnuts, and (sometimes called ), equivalent to the French beignets. Traditional Polish doughnuts are filled with rose petal jam, plum jam, or stewed apple and covered with icing with orange peel or powdered with icing sugar. Fat Thursday used to mark the beginning of a &quot;Fat Week&quot;, a period of great gluttony during which Polish ancestors consumed dishes served with (lard), bacon, and all kinds of meat.

The original doughnuts, popular until the 16th century, were made of the same dough as bread, and would be filled with pork and fried on &quot;&quot;. Only later were they made as patisserie.

===Easter breakfast===

A typical Easter breakfast often consists of cold-cuts served with horseradish sauce and beetroot salads, breads, bigos, żurek, kiełbasa, smoked salmon or herring, marinated vegetable salads, Easter salad (chopped boiled eggs, green peas, ćwikła, carrot, apple, potato, parsley, and mayonnaise), coffee, tea and cakes (such as chocolate cake), , , and .

==Bread==

Bread () and bread rolls ( (bread roll), , , ) have been an essential part of Polish cuisine and tradition for centuries. Today, bread remains one of the most important foods in the Polish cuisine. The main ingredient for Polish bread is rye or wheat. Traditional bread has a crunchy crust, a soft interior, and an unforgettable aroma. Such bread is made with sourdough, which lends it a distinctive taste. It can be stored for a week or so without getting too hard and is not crumbly when cut.

In Poland, welcoming with bread and salt (&quot;) is often associated with the traditional hospitality (&quot;) of the Polish nobility (), who prided themselves on their hospitality. A 17th-century Polish poet, Wespazjan Kochowski, wrote in 1674: &quot;O good bread, when it is given to guests with salt and good will!&quot; Another poet, Wacław Potocki, mentioned this custom. The custom was, however, not limited to the nobility, as Polish people of all classes observed this tradition, reflected in old Polish proverbs. Nowadays, the tradition is mainly observed on wedding days, when newlyweds are greeted with bread and salt by their parents on returning from the church wedding.

==Beverages==
===Alcohol===

Traditional Polish alcoholic beverages include mead, beer, vodka (Old Polish: , ), and to a lesser extent, wine. In recent decades, beer has become very common: popular are both traditional Polish beer styles like Baltic porter and oak-smoked Grodziskie and also many other styles brewed by many small craft breweries. Wine is less frequently drunk, however, in recent years, the consumption of wine has risen along with increasing production of local grape wines in small vineyards in Lesser Poland, Subcarpathia, Silesia, and West Pomerania regions.

Among alcoholic beverages, Polish vodka—traditionally prepared from grain or potatoes—has essentially displaced the formerly widespread mead.

Some sources suggest that the first production of vodka took place in Poland as early as the 8th century, becoming more widespread in the 11th century. The world&#x27;s first written mention of the drink and of the word &quot;vodka&quot; was in 1405 from recorder of deeds, the court documents from the Palatinate of Sandomierz in Poland.

Vodka production on a much larger scale began in Poland at the end of the 16th century. By the 17th and 18th centuries, Polish vodka was known in the Netherlands, Denmark, England, Russia, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Romania, Ukraine, Bulgaria, and the Black Sea basin. Vodka was the most popular alcoholic drink in Poland until 1998, when it was surpassed by beer.

Beside clear vodkas, flavoured vodka (known as nalewka) and liqueurs are also popular. The most important are Żubrówka (vodka with bison grass from Podlaskie), herbal Żołądkowa Gorzka, aged , plum brandy (especially from Łącko), honey liqueur , as well as Goldwasser (herbal liqueur with flakes of gold leaf) and juniper vodka , both originating from Gdańsk.

===Non-alcoholic drinks===

Traditionally, kvass () was a fermented beverage first popular among the peasantry, but it later spread to the szlachta and became a universal Polish drink by the 14th-15th centuries. It is typically made from rye bread, usually known as black bread, and is not classified as an alcoholic beverage in Poland, as its alcohol content usually ranges from 0% to 2%. There are many commercial and family variations of the beverage; however, traditional Polish recipes still exist. Despite its production on an industrial scale in Poland during the interbellum, it began to lose popularity to mass-produced soft drinks and carbonated water in the 20th century. It remained known primarily in rural areas of eastern Poland. However, kvass started making a comeback in the 21st century, with many new Polish brands being started.

Since the turn of the century, tea is perhaps the most popular beverage, usually served with a slice of lemon and sweetened with either sugar or honey. Tea came to Poland from England shortly after its appearance in Western Europe, mainly due to the Dutch merchants. However, its prevalence is attributed to the Russians in the 19th century – at this time samovars imported from Russia become commonplace in Polish homes. Tea with milk is called ().

Coffee has been widely drunk since the 18th century, when Poland bordered the Ottoman Empire.

Other frequently consumed beverages include buttermilk, kefir, soured milk, instant coffee, various mineral waters, juices, and numerous brands of soft drinks. A considerable number of Poles enjoy carbonated water, and customers in restaurants are always offered both still and sparkling (carbonated) water to drink.

<text>Glafcos Ioannou Clerides (; 24 April 1919 – 15 November 2013) was a Cypriot statesman, who served as President of Cyprus in 1974 and from 1993 to 2003. 

A barrister and former Royal Air Force pilot, Clerides played an important role in the Cypriot struggle for independence, first as a member of the anti-colonial guerrilla organization EOKA and later in the drafting of the country&#x27;s constitution. He then served as the first Speaker of the House of Representatives from 1960 to 1976, and briefly took over the presidency of Cyprus on an interim basis following the failure of the 1974 coup, overseeing the island&#x27;s defence amidst the Turkish invasion. Clerides founded the center-right Democratic Rally in 1976 and won the presidential election as its candidate in 1993, before securing a second term in 1998. He failed to win a third term in 2003. As President, Clerides presided over a period of significant economic growth and was instrumental in Cyprus&#x27; accession to the European Union. Widely respected for his political and legal acumen, he remained an influential figure in Cypriot politics until his death in 2013.

==Personal life==
Clerides was born in Nicosia. He was the eldest son of the lawyer and statesman Ioannis Clerides and Elli Argyridou. He had one sister, Chrysanthi, and one brother, Ksanthos. Clerides married Lila Erulkar (31 October 1921 – 6 June 2007), the Indian Jewish daughter of Abraham Erulkar, personal physician to Mahatma Gandhi, in London in 1947. They had one daughter, Katherine (born 1949 in London), who went on to serve as a member of the House of the Representatives for the Democratic Rally. He died on 15 November 2013 in Nicosia.

==World War II==
During World War II, Clerides served in the British Royal Air Force. In 1942 his airplane was shot down over Germany and he was captured. He remained a prisoner of war until the end of the conflict. His name was mentioned in dispatches for distinguished services.

==Post-World War II==
Following the war, he studied law at King&#x27;s College London and earned an LLB degree in 1948. He was called to the bar through Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1949, and went on to practice law in Cyprus.

==Cypriot independence==
During the 1955-59 Cypriot War of Independence, he served in EOKA under the pseudonym &#x27;Hyperides&#x27; and defended many of the organization&#x27;s fighters who had been arrested by the British authorities. One of his most important accomplishments during that time was the composition of a dossier that enumerated and provided evidence on cases of human rights violations by the British, which the Greek government presented to the Council of Europe&#x27;s Human Rights Committee.

Clerides participated in the 1959 London Conference on Cyprus and during the transitional period from colonial administration to independence (1959–1960), he served as Minister of Justice. During the same period he was head of the Greek Cypriot delegation in the Joint Constitutional Committee. 

==Post-independence ==
In July 1960, he was elected to the House of Representatives which, in turn, elected him as its first speaker. He held this position until 22 July 1976. In the first presidential election Clerides backed Makarios III, the other candidate being his father Ioannis Clerides.

Following the 1974 coup d&#x27;état in which EOKA B, a Greek Cypriot unionist paramilitary organization, overthrew the democratically elected president Makarios and installed Nikos Sampson, Turkey invaded Cyprus. Three days later, Sampson was forced to resign. On the same day, 23 July 1974, Clerides temporarily assumed the duties of the President of the Republic, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Constitution. He exercised these duties until 7 December 1974, the day of the return of Makarios, who was forced to flee on 16 July 1974 on account of the coup. Both Makarios and the House of Representatives thanked Clerides publicly for the task he performed during that period. Critics, especially from EDEK refer to that period as the post-coup, implying that democracy was not fully restored until the return of Makarios. Clerides on the other hand had repeatedly condemned what he called &quot;violence and counter violence&quot; that led to the coup (i.e. the conflict between EOKA-B and &quot;Efedriko&quot;, a special paramilitary police body formed to fight EOKA-B).

In 1976 he founded the Democratic Rally (DISY). He was a candidate for the presidency of Cyprus five times between 1983 and 2003 and elected to two five-year terms, in 1993 and in 1998. 

Clerides was the author of an autobiographical over-toned depiction of 20th century Cypriot history, &quot;My Deposition&quot;, in four volumes (Alithia Publishing, Cyprus, 1988).

==Presidency==
Clerides was elected president of the Republic of Cyprus in 1993 and was re-elected in 1998. 

His government played a crucial role in Cyprus&#x27; accession to the European Union, with negotiations starting in 1998 and successfully concluding in 2002. It is noteworthy that Clerides achieved Cyprus&#x27; accession to the European Union without a prerequisite of a solution to the Cyprus problem.

Under his leadership, Cyprus boasted a stable economy that made it the wealthiest of the ten countries that joined the European Union in 2004.

Clerides&#x27; presidency was also marked by efforts to strengthen the defensive capabilities of the Cypriot National Guard. In November 1993, the &quot;Defense Doctrine of the Single Area&quot; was declared by Greece and Cyprus, with its main characteristic being its defensive nature and the goal of preventing or dealing with any aggressive action against either party. With the declaration of the doctrine, Greece&#x27;s commitment to considering any Turkish attempt to advance in free Cyprus as a cause of war was emphasized.

His administration&#x27;s purchase of S-300 air-defense missiles in 1997 resulted in a rapidly escalating political standoff between Cyprus and Turkey. Under heavy international pressure, Clerides decided to transfer the S-300s to the Hellenic Air Force in exchange for alternative weapons from Greece.

He was defeated in the 2003 presidential election by Tassos Papadopoulos, after a campaign with heavy emphasis on the Annan Plan.

==Honors and awards==
From 1959 to 1960 Clerides held the position of President of the Cyprus Red Cross. In recognition of his outstanding services he was awarded a Certificate of Honor and Life Membership. He was also named an Honorary Member of the International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation.

Posthumously, the Republic of Cyprus gave his name to Larnaca International Airport.

=== Honors received from foreign countries ===
* : Knight of the Collar of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre
* : Companion of Honour with Collar of the National Order of Merit (5 September 2002)
* : Grand Cross of the Order of the Redeemer

<text>&quot;&quot; (, &quot;The Watch on the Rhine&quot;) is a German patriotic anthem. The song&#x27;s origins are rooted in the historical French–German enmity, and it was particularly popular in Germany during the Franco-Prussian War, World War I, and World War II. The original poem was written by Max Schneckenburger during the Rhine crisis of 1840, and is generally sung to music written by Karl Wilhelm in 1854, seven years after Schneckenburger&#x27;s death.

== Origin ==

Repeated French efforts to annex the Left Bank of the Rhine began with the devastating wars of King Louis XIV. French forces carried out massive scorched earth campaigns in the German south-west. This policy was fully implemented during the Napoleonic Wars with the creation of the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806–1813. In the two centuries from the Thirty Years&#x27; War to the final defeat of Napoleon I, the German inhabitants of lands by the Rhine suffered from repeated French invasions.

The defeat and exile of Napoleon gave the Germans some respite, but during the Rhine Crisis of 1840, French prime minister Adolphe Thiers advanced the claim that the Upper and Middle Rhine River should serve as his country&#x27;s &quot;natural eastern border&quot;. The member states of the German Confederation feared that France was resuming her annexationist designs.

Nikolaus Becker responded to these events by writing a poem called &quot; in which he swore to defend the Rhine. The Swabian merchant Max Schneckenburger, inspired by the German praise and French opposition this received, then wrote the poem &quot;.

In the poem, with five original stanzas, a &quot;thunderous call&quot; is made for all Germans to rush and defend the German Rhine, to ensure that &quot;no enemy sets his foot on the shore of the Rhine&quot; (4th stanza). Two stanzas with a more specific text were added by others later. Unlike the older &quot; which praised a monarch, &quot; and other songs written in this period, such as the &quot; (the third verse of which is Germany&#x27;s current national anthem) and &quot; (What is the German&#x27;s Fatherland?) by Ernst Moritz Arndt, called for Germans to unite, to put aside sectionalism, sectarianism, and the rivalries of the various German kingdoms and principalities, to establish a unified German state and defend Germany&#x27;s territorial integrity.

Schneckenburger worked in Restoration Switzerland, and his poem was first set to music in Bern by Swiss organist J. Mendel, and performed by tenor for the Prussian ambassador, von Bunsen. This first version did not become very popular. When Karl Wilhelm, musical director of the city of Krefeld, received the poem in 1854, he produced a musical setting and performed it with his men&#x27;s chorus on 11 June, the day of the silver anniversary of the marriage of Prinz Wilhelm von Preussen, later German Emperor Wilhelm I. This version gained popularity at later events.

==Usage in Germany==

During the &quot;Vormärz&quot; era and the Revolutions of 1848, a Rhine romanticism movement arose, stressing the cultural and historical significance of the Rhine Gorge and the German territories on the river&#x27;s left bank around the cities of Cologne, Worms, Trier and Speyer.

In response to the Ems Dispatch incident, which occurred in Bad Ems, not far from the Rhine, France initiated the Franco-Prussian War of 1870/71. When in the aftermath of the subsequent French defeat, the Prussian prime minister Otto von Bismarck achieved the Unification of Germany and the German Empire including Alsace–Lorraine was established, &quot;—beside &quot;—was the unofficial second national anthem. The song became famous, and both the composer and the family of the author were honoured and granted an annual pension by Bismarck.

The song&#x27;s lyrics also appear on the 1883 Niederwald monument located just outside Rüdesheim am Rhein high above the river, epitomising the &quot;guard on the Rhine&quot; itself.

From World War I through to 1945, the &quot;Watch on the Rhine&quot; was one of the most popular songs in Germany, again rivaling the &quot;&quot; as the &quot;de facto&quot; national anthem. In World War II, the daily &quot;Wehrmachtbericht&quot; radio report began with the tune, until it was replaced by the fanfare from Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Les préludes&quot; in 1941. The song&#x27;s title was also used as the codename for the German offensive in 1944 known today as the Battle of the Bulge.

However, the scenario envisioned in the song – i.e., an enemy approaching the Rhine and seeking to cross it, and patriotic German youths mobilizing en masse to defend the river with their lives – never came about in reality. Due to the German Army&#x27;s preferred offensive strategy, the fighting in 1870–71, 1914–1918 and 1940 all took place on French soil, far to the west of the Rhine. The same is true also for the German offensive in the 1944 Battle of the Bulge – which as noted used &quot;Watch on the Rhine&quot; as its code name, but actually took place away from the river. In 1945 Operation Plunder did result in a successful allied crossing of the Rhine, but by then Germany was on the verge of collapse, no longer capable of this kind of mobilization.

Today, the lands along the western bank of the Rhine between Switzerland and the Netherlands are mainly part of Germany. The Saarland, Rhineland-Palatinate and North Rhine-Westphalia are German federal states; Alsace and northern Lorraine are parts of France with a German cultural element to them. The French–German enmity was ended in 1963 with the Élysée Treaty and the implementation of the Franco–German friendship, so that the danger of an invasion that loomed for centuries over both nations no longer exists. Today, the song has only historical significance in Germany and is rarely sung or played.

==Stage and film==
The song has figured in stage works and films.

The tune is quoted near the end of César Cui&#x27;s opera &quot;Mademoiselle Fifi&quot; (composed 1902/1903), set in France during the Franco–Prussian War.

In Lewis Milestone&#x27;s 1930 film &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;, the song is played at the end of the first scene as schoolboys, whipped into a patriotic frenzy by their instructor, abandon their studies and head off to enlist in the army. It is also heard in the background of the 1979 remake version of &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; when Paul (played by Richard Thomas) is preparing to board the train on his way to the front for the first time.

In Jean Renoir&#x27;s 1937 film &quot;La Grande Illusion&quot;, two songs are juxtaposed in exactly the same way as in &quot;Casablanca&quot; five years later. In the latter movie, &quot;&quot; was sung by German officers, who then were drowned out by exiled French singing La Marseillaise (which began as the &quot;War Song for the Army of the Rhine&quot;, written and composed at the Rhine).

The song provides the title for Lillian Hellman&#x27;s cautionary pre-World War II play &quot;Watch on the Rhine&quot; (1941) and the 1943 movie based on it.

In the first and second part of Rainer Werner Fassbinder&#x27;s 1980 epic film adaptation of Alfred Döblin&#x27;s &quot;Berlin Alexanderplatz&quot; (1929), Franz Biberkopf starts singing the song (as in the novel).

In John Ringo&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;Watch on the Rhine&quot; (2005), cannibal alien hordes landing in France advance towards Germany, and Germans prepare to block them at the Rhine.

In the parodic science fiction film &quot;Iron Sky&quot; (2012), the Nazis living on the far side of the Moon use the song&#x27;s tune (with different lyrics) as their national anthem.

In François Ozon&#x27;s 2016 film &quot;Franz&quot;, a portion of the song is sung by several German characters in a bar.

==Adaptations==
The tune for the alma mater of Yale University, &quot;Bright College Years&quot;, was taken from Karl Wilhelm&#x27;s &quot;Die Wacht am Rhein&quot;. New lyrics to the &quot;splendid tune&quot; were written by Henry Durand in 1881.

The tune was used by Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Connecticut, for their hymn &quot;Fair Hotchkiss&quot;. The tune is used by Doshisha University for its school song, &quot;Doshisha College Song&quot;.

Italian poet Giovanni Pascoli also wrote new, patriotic lyrics to the song&#x27;s tune, titled &quot;La vedetta delle Alpi&quot;. They speak about a &quot;guard on the Alps&quot; (Alps play the part of the sacred boundaries, just as the Rhein river does in the original lyrics). The poem bears the subtitle &quot;Twin anthem of the &#x27;Wacht am Rhein&#x27;&quot;.

At the outbreak of the First World War a British song parodying the original &quot;When We&#x27;ve Wound Up the Watch on the Rhine&quot; enjoyed success.

<text>Sea World is a marine mammal park, oceanarium, and theme park located on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. It offers attractions such as rides and animal exhibits and promotes conservation through education and the rescue and rehabilitation of sick, injured or orphaned wildlife. The park is commercially linked to Warner Bros. Movie World and Wet&#x27;n&#x27;Wild Gold Coast as part of the theme park division of Village Roadshow. The park has no affiliation with an American park chain of a similar name.

==History==


===Park history===
Sea World was founded by Keith Williams as the Surfers Paradise Ski Gardens. The main attractions were &quot;water ski shows that combined SOS, aqua ballet and action&quot;. In 1971, the Surfers Paradise Ski Gardens moved to land on The Spit. Major dredging works were required to build the new ski lake. A year later, the Surfers Paradise Ski Gardens became known as Sea World with the introduction of dolphins, marine displays, a replica of the Endeavour, a swimming pool, a licensed restaurant and a gift shop. Additions over the next decade included the purchasing of the competitor marine park, Marineland, and the transfer of animals and exhibits to Sea World, as well as more shops and food outlets.

SeaWorld was repeatedly rated as Australia&#x27;s best tourist attraction by the Australian Tourism Awards through the 1980s. In 1984, Keith Williams sold the park to property development group Pivot Leisure. In 1988, Pivot built the 402-room Sea World Nara Resort, a joint development between SeaWorld Property Trust and Nara Hotels Japan. In 1991, Pivot Leisure, Warner Bros. and Village Roadshow jointly developed and opened Warner Bros. Movie World, a Hollywood theme action park, at Oxenford on the Gold Coast. That year, Pivot also purchased the Wet n&#x27; Wild Water park located next to the site of Warner Bros. Movie World. In 1993, Warner Bros. and Village Roadshow jointly acquired Pivot Leisure&#x27;s interest in Warner Bros. Movie World, Sea World and the adjoining Sea World Nara Resort.

== Accidents and incidents ==
Several accidents or incidents have occurred at or near the Sea World theme park.

=== 1991 Gold Coast helicopter collision with terrain ===
On 3 March 1991 at 1:58pm, six passengers and the pilot on board a Bell 206L-1 LongRanger II were killed during a joy-flight departing from Sea World at Surfrider. The helicopter climbed steeply with its nose facing almost vertically upwards. It then fell backwards, resulting in the tail boom being severed by the main rotor blades, causing the helicopter to crash on a South Stradbroke Island beach. The investigation found the helicopter was airworthy and there was no evidence of the pilot attempting a deliberate manoeuvre such as a torque turn. Although the pilot was unknowingly suffering from myocarditis, which could result in loss of consciousness or death, the reason for the loss of control could not be established.

=== 2023 Gold Coast helicopter mid-air collision ===

On 2 January 2023 at 1:59pm, two helicopters operated by Sea World Helicopters (a separate company from Sea World) collided near the resort. The departing helicopter (containing seven occupants) fell to the ground and crashed, killing four people and critically injuring three. The arriving helicopter (containing six occupants) landed safely, with five of the occupants suffering relatively minor injuries, mostly from glass shards from the broken windshield.

<text>Åslaug Marie Haga (born 21 October 1959) is a Norwegian diplomat, politician and international civil servant. She has been board chair for various organizations, including the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research (NINA) and the Peace Research Institute in Oslo (PRIO). Haga has published three books: two on Norwegian politics and one novel.

She is currently the associate vice-president of the External Relations and Governance Department at the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), a specialized agency of the United Nations.

Prior to that, she was executive director of the Global Crop Diversity Trust from 2013 to 2019.

==Early life and career==
Haga was born in Nes, Akershus. She has a bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science, history and sociology from the University of Oslo. She joined the diplomatic corps before finishing her master&#x27;s degree in political science. She served at the Norwegian delegation to the United Nations in New York in the late 1980s and at the Norwegian embassy in New Delhi, India in the early 1990s.

==Political career==
Haga served as State Secretary for Foreign Affairs from 1991 – 1997 and Minister of Culture from 1999 to 2000. In 2001, she was elected to the Storting from Akershus County, and she was re-elected in 2005. In 2003, while the Centre Party was an opposition party, she became party leader. As leader of the Centre Party, Haga was instrumental in swinging the party&#x27;s political course to the left, bringing it into a coalition with the Labour Party and the Socialist Left Party for the first time.

Following the success of this Red-Green Coalition in the 2005 parliamentary elections, the Centre Party entered the government, and Haga succeeded Erna Solberg as Minister for Local Municipalities and Regional Development in the second cabinet Stoltenberg. In September 2007, she became Minister of Petroleum and Energy, succeeding Odd Roger Enoksen, and leaving the regional department to Magnhild Meltveit Kleppa. On 11 April 2008, Haga announced that she would not be seeking re-election to Parliament at the 2009 election, and that she would step down as Centre Party leader before the election.

On 19 June 2008, she resigned as Minister of Petroleum and Energy, and as leader of the Centre Party. She suffered from health problems following a media storm about minor building violations that she was unaware of. Haga was replaced as Minister of Petroleum and Energy by Terje Riis-Johansen.

== Norwegian Air Ambulance ==
Haga was Secretary General of the Norwegian Air Ambulance from 2011 – 2013. A new training centre for rescue personnel – including medical doctors and pilots - was established at Torpomoen under her leadership.

== Global Crop Diversity Trust ==

Haga replaced Cary Fowler as executive director of the Global Crop Diversity Trust in early 2013 and held that position until the end of 2019. Under Haga&#x27;s leadership the Crop Trust became an independent international organization with a strong voice in agrobiodiversity conservation and use. She was responsible for, and signed, the first agreement to safeguard crops in perpetuity with the International Rice Research Institute in 2018.

== International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) ==
Haga is currently Associate Vice-president of the External Relations and Governance Department at IFAD. She is responsible for communications, global engagement, partnerships, and resource mobilization, as well as overseeing the relations with IFAD&#x27;s 177 Member States.

<text>In Canadian politics, a leadership convention is held by a political party when the party needs to choose a leader due to a vacancy or a challenge to the incumbent leader.

== Overview ==

In Canada, leaders of a party generally remain that party&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; candidate for Prime Minister until they die, resign, or are dismissed by the party. In the federal New Democratic Party (NDP) and some provincial NDPs, the position of party leader was treated as all other positions on the party&#x27;s executive committee, and open for election at party conventions generally held every two years although incumbent leaders rarely face more than token opposition.

Usually, outgoing leaders retains the party leadership until their successor is chosen at a leadership convention. However, in some circumstances, such as the death or immediate resignation of a leader, that is not possible, and an interim leader is appointed by the party for the duration of the leadership campaign.

In a few instances where a single leadership candidate has been unopposed by the entry deadline, the leadership convention has instead served as a venue for the membership to ratify the candidate. Even in such situations, however, the convention must still take place before the candidate can assume the formal and permanent leadership of the party, even if they are already serving as the party&#x27;s interim leader.

Traditionally, each riding association of a party holds a special meeting to elect a fixed number of delegates to represent it at a leadership convention. These meetings would often select &quot;alternate delegates&quot; or &quot;alternates&quot;, who would attend the convention but vote only if one of the delegates from the riding association was unable to attend. In addition, delegates are often selected by the party&#x27;s youth and women&#x27;s associations in each riding, and party associations at university and college campuses.

In addition to the elected delegates, a large number of &quot;ex officio&quot; delegates attend and vote at leadership conventions. These &quot;ex officio&quot; delegates are automatically entitled to attend by virtue of being an elected member of parliament for that party, a member of an affiliated party in a provincial legislature, a member of the party&#x27;s national or provincial executive, of the executive of an affiliated women&#x27;s or youth organization.

Because of the implementation of &quot;one member one vote&quot; (OMOV) systems and proportional delegate elections by most parties, conventions have declined in importance. In recent years, the result of the vote is either known before the convention, or the voting does not take place at the venue.

In a pure &quot;one member one vote&quot; system, each party member casts a ballot to elect the leader, and all ballots have equal weight. There are modified OMOV system may allow all members to vote but may weigh them differently in order to ensure equality among ridings regardless of party membership or which guarantee a proportion of the vote to historically important constituencies such as labour in the case of the NDP.

The Liberal Party of Canada held the first leadership convention in 1919, electing William Lyon Mackenzie King. Prior to that the leader of the party was chosen by the party&#x27;s parliamentary caucus. The historical Conservative Party used a leadership convention to select R.B. Bennett as party leader in 1927.

The Parti Québécois was the first political party in Canada to adopt an OMOV system. Most provincial and federal parties adopted forms of OMOV in the 1990s.

Until 2003, when it adopted an OMOV system, every biennial convention of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation and its successor, the New Democratic Party, in the twentieth century was a leadership convention. However, in practice, contested elections were only held in the NDP when there was a declared leadership race.

Both the modern Conservative Party and the NDP have instituted &quot;one member one vote&quot; systems in recent years. In 2003, the federal NDP used a modified system where the vote was calculated so that ballots cast by labour delegates had 25% weight in the total result while votes cast by party members had 75%. While this modification is still used by some provincial sections of the NDP, the federal NDP now uses a pure OMOV process without a carve-out for labour affiliates.

In 2004, the modern Conservative Party adopted the Progressive Conservative Party system of OMOV, where each riding had equal weight in a point system, with each riding being assigned 100 points, regardless of the number of votes cast in that riding. The party&#x27;s other predecessors, the Reform Party of Canada and Canadian Alliance, had pure OMOV systems. In 2021, the party constitution was amended to award one point per vote cast in a riding, up to a maximum of 100 points. 

The Liberals were the last federal party to select its leaders using delegated conventions, though more recent Liberal conventions used a system where delegates in a riding were apportioned by proportional representation. In 2009 the Liberal Party approved a constitutional amendment requiring future leadership elections to be conducted using a modified OMOV system in which each riding is accorded equal weight. The 2009 convention that ratified Michael Ignatieff&#x27;s leadership was conducted under the old rules. The last delegated Liberal convention to feature a contested race was the 2006 convention that chose Stéphane Dion.

The Bloc Québécois has used a pure OMOV system since 1997.

== Recent federal conventions ==
The Conservatives held their most recent leadership election on September 10, 2022 due to Erin O’Toole’s resignation as party leader following the party&#x27;s poorer-than-expected showing in the 2021 federal election. The Conservatives elected Pierre Poilievre as its new leader on the first ballot.

The Liberals, on April 14, 2013 chose Justin Trudeau as their leader at the party&#x27;s leadership election. The Liberal Party used a weighted One Member One Vote system in which all party members could cast ballots but in which they would be counted so that each riding had equal weight.

The New Democratic Party held its most recent leadership election on October 1, 2017, due to incumbent leader Thomas Mulcair having lost a vote on a leadership review at the New Democratic Party&#x27;s federal convention held in Edmonton, Alberta on April 10, 2016. The NDP chose Jagmeet Singh as its new leader.

The Bloc Québécois held its most recent leadership election on January 17, 2019 and chose Yves-François Blanchet as leader.

The Green Party held its most recent leadership election between September 26 and October 3, 2020 and chose Annamie Paul as leader on the eighth ballot. With Paul&#x27;s resignation as leader on November 10, 2021, necessitating a future leadership election.

<text>Thomas Littleton Powys, 4th Baron Lilford (18 March 1833 – 17 June 1896), was a British aristocrat and ornithologist.

==Life==
Lilford was the eldest son of Thomas Powys, 3rd Baron Lilford, and Mary Elizabeth Fox, daughter of Henry Vassall-Fox, 3rd Baron Holland. He was born in Stanhope Street, Mayfair, London, on 18 March 1833.

He succeeded his father as fourth baron in 1861. Lilford was one of the eight founders of the British Ornithologists&#x27; Union in 1858 and its president from 1867 until his death. He was also the first President of the Northamptonshire Natural History Society.

Lilford travelled widely, especially around the Mediterranean and his extensive collection of birds was maintained in the grounds of Lilford Hall, his second residence was Bank Hall in Bretherton, Lancashire, which he inherited from his father (3rd Baron Lilford), who inherited it from George Anthony Legh Keck. He inherited the Holland Estates from his mother&#x27;s family.
Until 1891, his aviaries featured birds from around the globe, including rheas, kiwis, pink-headed ducks and a pair of free-flying bearded vultures.
He was responsible for the introduction of the little owl into England in the 1880s.

He wrote about birds including &quot;Notes on the Birds of Northamptonshire and Neighbourhood&quot; (1895) and &quot;Coloured Figures of the Birds of the British Islands&quot;, which was completed by Osbert Salvin after his death.

A species of European lizard, &quot;Podarcis lilfordi&quot;, is named in his honour.

==Family==

Lord Lilford married, firstly, Emma Elizabeth Brandling, daughter of Robert William Brandling, in 1859. After her death in 1884 he married, secondly, Clementina Georgina, daughter of Ker Baillie-Hamilton, in 1885.

He died in June 1896, aged 63, and was succeeded in the barony by his eldest son from his first marriage, John.
Lady Lilford died in 1929.
A metal plaque commemorating a &quot;Cedar of Atlantica&quot; planted by Lady Lilford in 1897, was found in 2005 and is displayed in the visitor centre at Bank Hall.

<text>SeaWorld is an American theme park chain with headquarters in Orlando, Florida. It is a proprietor of marine mammal parks, oceanariums, animal theme parks, and rehabilitation centers owned by United Parks &amp; Resorts. The parks host shows starring marine mammals, especially dolphins (including orcas) and pinnipeds (e.g. sea lions), as well as zoological displays featuring various other marine animals.

The parks also feature thrill rides, including roller coasters like Kraken, Mako and Manta at SeaWorld Orlando, which can also be found at SeaWorld San Diego, and Steel Eel and The Great White at SeaWorld San Antonio. Emperor, Arctic Rescue, and Electric Eel can be found at SeaWorld San Diego, with the first two being added in the past three years alone. Journey to Atlantis, a combination roller coaster and splashdown ride, can be found at all three parks.

There are operations located within the United States in Orlando, Florida; San Diego, California; San Antonio, Texas; later outside the United States such as Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; and previously Aurora, Ohio. On March 5, 2007, SeaWorld Orlando announced the addition of the Aquatica water park to its adventure park, which already includes SeaWorld and Discovery Cove.

The parks were bought in 1989 by Busch Entertainment Corp., the family entertainment division of Anheuser-Busch, which is best known for brewing beer. In 2009, Busch Entertainment was sold to the Blackstone Group and subsequently renamed SeaWorld Entertainment. In 2013, Blackstone sold 37% of SeaWorld Entertainment in an initial public offering and sold its remaining 21% holding to Zhonghong Zhuoye in 2017. It is a major theme park competitor to Six Flags, Disney Experiences and Universal Destinations &amp; Experiences.

The parks&#x27; marine mammal collections have been the subject of public debate and criticism over the years, with critics saying that the park&#x27;s practices entail animal abuse. The 2013 documentary film &quot;Blackfish&quot;, produced after a SeaWorld Orlando trainer was killed by one of the park&#x27;s orcas, led to initial decreases in attendance, profits and the company&#x27;s share price. In 2018, SeaWorld&#x27;s attendance and revenue began to recover with the addition of new rides, shows, and animal exhibits at its parks, as well as increased marketing about the parks&#x27; conservation and rescue efforts.

In 2016, SeaWorld announced that they would end their in-park orca breeding program and eventually phase out their theatrical orca shows altogether (due to state legislation in California that banned shows using orcas) starting in San Diego. It was announced later in the same year, that SeaWorld would build their first park without killer whales and outside of the United States in Abu Dhabi. In 2020, SeaWorld Orlando introduced its Orca Encounter presentation to guests.

==History==

SeaWorld was founded in 1964 by Milton Shedd, Ken Norris, David Demott and George Millay. The four graduates of UCLA originally set out to build an underwater restaurant and marine life show. When the underwater restaurant concept was deemed unfeasible, they scrapped those plans and decided to build a park instead, and SeaWorld San Diego was opened on March 21, 1964. With only a few dolphins, sea lions, 6 attractions and , the park proved to be a success and more than 400,000 guests visited in the first 12 months.

After considering other locations in the midwest, including the Lake Milton/Newton Falls area west of Youngstown, Ohio, it was decided that Aurora, Ohio would be the new home of a SeaWorld. The park opened on May 29, 1970. The Aurora site was approximately northwest of the Lake Milton site and southeast of Cleveland. By this time, the founders of the company had captured a few more species of animals, including a killer whale that was brought to the new facility. The harsh winter climate permitted the park to be open only from mid-May until mid-September.

The Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida opened near the end of the second operating season of SeaWorld Ohio. The success of Disney in Orlando provided a location that was already popular with tourists. SeaWorld Orlando opened in 1973.

Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Inc. (HBJ) purchased the company in 1976 and 12 years later they built a new park in Texas. In 1988, SeaWorld San Antonio opened just a few miles outside of San Antonio. Growth has pushed the city outwards and now SeaWorld San Antonio lies in the Westover Hills community in West San Antonio. The park was open year-round like its sister parks in California and Florida in 1988 and 1989, then went to a seasonal schedule.

In May 1987, Robert Maxwell&#x27;s British Printing and Communication Corporation (BPCC) made an unsolicited bid to acquire HBJ. HBJ defended itself from the hostile takeover attempt by going deeply into debt to make large cash payments to shareholders. The strain of the debt from fighting off the takeover, as well as a strategic decision to re-focus on HBJ&#x27;s core publishing and insurance businesses, were factors in HBJ&#x27;s decision to sell its theme park holdings in 1989.

The Anheuser-Busch Company made an offer to purchase the SeaWorld parks. HBJ also owned and operated two other parks, Cypress Gardens and Boardwalk and Baseball, and out of fear of not being able to find a buyer for the two other parks, HBJ refused to sell the parks individually. Despite a long negotiation, Anheuser-Busch bought all six parks in 1989: SeaWorld in San Diego, Aurora, Orlando and San Antonio as well as Cypress Gardens in Winter Haven and Boardwalk and Baseball in Haines City. Soon after the sale was final, Busch sold Cypress Gardens to the park&#x27;s management and closed Boardwalk and Baseball. Anheuser-Busch put millions of dollars back into the parks to revive and prolong their longevity. SeaWorld is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA).

In July 2008, Anheuser-Busch was purchased by Belgian-Brazilian brewer InBev. InBev had a reputation as a cost-cutting company that would not be interested in holding non-beverage businesses. In 2009, the combined AB InBev sold its Busch Entertainment division to the Blackstone Group. The company was renamed SeaWorld Parks &amp; Entertainment in December 2009. In 2013, Blackstone sold 37% of SEAS in an initial public offering.

In 2016, SeaWorld admitted that it had been sending its employees to pose as activists to spy on animal rights organization PETA. Following an investigation by an outside law firm, SeaWorld&#x27;s Board of Directors directed management to end the practice.

==List of theme parks==
===SeaWorld San Diego===
SeaWorld San Diego, the first SeaWorld park, opened on March 21, 1964. The park features shows such as &quot;Sea Lions Live&quot;, a comedic show with sea lions and otters, &quot;Dolphin Days&quot;, a dolphin show, and &quot;Orca Encounter&quot;, an educational show about killer whales and their behavior in the wild. There are also seasonal shows featured in the summer, like &quot;Cirque Electrique&quot;. Rides include Shipwreck Rapids, an Intamin River Rapids ride, Manta, a Mack Rides Family Launch Coaster, Electric Eel, a Premier Rides Sky Rocket II, Journey to Atlantis, a Mack Rides Water Coaster, Emperor, a Bolliger &amp; Mabillard dive coaster, and Arctic Rescue, an Intamin Family Launch Straddle Coaster. Electric Ocean is the park&#x27;s nightly summer event featuring pop and electronic style music with lights and seasonal shows, Sea Lions Tonite (a nighttime Sea Lion show featuring spoofs of other SeaWorld shows and attractions), Atlantis Ignites (a tesla coil and projection show), and Cirque Electrique (a Cirque du Soleil-style show on the water that is an electric remaster of the original Cirque de la Mer show).

===SeaWorld Orlando===
SeaWorld Orlando opened on December 15, 1973. &quot;One Ocean&quot;, a killer whale show that premiered April 22, 2011, was hosted here, before being replaced with &quot;Orca Encounter&quot;, along with, &quot;Dolphin Days&quot;, the park&#x27;s dolphin show, and, a new show that made its debut on June 14, 2015, &quot;Clyde and Seamore&#x27;s Sea Lion High&quot;. This show was changed to &quot;Sea Lion &amp; Otter Spotlight&quot; in mid 2021. The park contains 3 main roller coasters, with a fourth opening in 2022, joined by one junior coaster. They are Kraken, a floorless coaster based on the mythical sea creature, Manta, a coaster designed to simulate how manta rays move, and Mako, a hyper coaster themed to the fastest shark in the ocean. All three are built by the manufacturer B&amp;M, while Super Grover&#x27;s Box Car Derby, a coaster oriented to kids located in the Sesame Street themed area of the park, is built by Zierer. SeaWorld Orlando&#x27;s newest coaster is Ice Breaker, which opened in 2022, containing the steepest drop of all main SeaWorld Orlando coasters, built by Premier Rides. The Orlando park is also home to the original Journey to Atlantis, a intricately themed water coaster by Mack Rides. SeaWorld&#x27;s Electric Ocean is SeaWorld Orlando&#x27;s night program, featuring the fireworks show &quot;Ignite&quot;, a sea lion show &quot;Sea Lions Tonite&quot;, a dolphin show &quot;Touch The Sky&quot; and killer whale show &quot;Shamu&#x27;s Celebration: Light Up the Night&quot;.

===SeaWorld San Antonio===
SeaWorld San Antonio opened on May 27, 1988. Its formal opening over Memorial Day Weekend 1988 entertained about 75,000 people. 3.3 million people visited SeaWorld San Antonio during its first year, 10% more than what had been projected. The park shows &quot;Orca Encounter&quot;, an educational killer whale show; Ocean Discovery an educational show featuring dolphins and beluga whales; and &quot;Sea Lion &amp; Otter Spotlight&quot;, a sea lion show following the sea lions Clyde and Seamore touring a marine conservation center. Park rides include Wave Breaker: The Rescue Coaster, a double launch roller coaster, The Great White, an inverted roller coaster, Steel Eel, a roller coaster reaching a height of 150 feet, Journey to Atlantis, a water roller coaster into the mythical land of Atlantis and Texas Stingray a wooden steel hybrid Coaster.

=== SeaWorld Abu Dhabi ===

In 2008, Busch Entertainment had earlier announced plans to open a fourth SeaWorld park in Dubai, UAE, but those plans were abandoned amidst the international financial crisis. In May 2014, SeaWorld announced renewed plans to build a park in the Middle East, but did not specify a timeline or specific location. On December 13, 2016, SeaWorld announced that it would open its first overseas theme park on Yas Island in Abu Dhabi, UAE in 2022. It would also be the first franchised SeaWorld park. SeaWorld announced in October 2022 that the park was 90% completed and was almost open. Finally, on May 24, 2023, SeaWorld Abu Dhabi opened to the public.

==SeaWorld Ohio sale, rebirth, and eventual transition==
In February 2001, Anheuser-Busch sold the SeaWorld Ohio park to Six Flags, Inc., operators of neighboring Six Flags Ohio (initially Geauga Lake until 2000). Upon completion of the sale, the two parks were combined in spring 2001 as the so-called &quot;mega-park&quot; &quot;Six Flags Worlds of Adventure&quot;, which boasted its &quot;three parks in one&quot; uniqueness: a waterpark, an amusement park, and a wildlife animal park, all included in one price of admission. SeaWorld executives replied that their park was sold because of the short season of the animal park, Northeastern Ohio&#x27;s cold winter months, and also because they were not able to get the necessary permits to build roller coasters like the other SeaWorld properties had been able to.

In March 2004, Six Flags announced that it had sold Six Flags Worlds of Adventure to Cedar Fair Entertainment Company, operators of the Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio. Cedar Fair returned the park to its original Geauga Lake name and stripped the park itself of all Looney Tunes and DC Comics branding, including walk around character costumes pertaining to either franchise, since the company did not have the licensing rights. Since Six Flags retained ownership of the animals, the majority of the animal portion of the park, including all of the exhibits and animal stadiums, was either emptied or fenced off for the 2004 season.

After a nearly season-long wait, the Cedar Fair company announced its plans for the non-operational side. That entire portion of the land would become an immense waterpark, Wildwater Kingdom, opening in two phases, with the first phase in 2005, followed by the second phase in 2006. This decision marked the end of the marine-life park permanently.

All of the animal stadiums and buildings were next torn down or converted into other venues. Some of the SeaWorld property remained intact, albeit hidden or modified. What remained included the former seal and sea lion area, the Ski Stadium (to be used in a Lumberjack show in 2006), the aquarium (to be used for unknown purposes), and two movie theater houses/simulators, once housing 3D/4D movies. The Ski Stadium was removed in 2008 to make way for Coconut Cove, a refreshment station/observation area.

All of these, except for Wildwater Kingdom, closed in 2007. Wildwater Kingdom closed after the 2016 season.

==Orcas==
SeaWorld&#x27;s main attraction is its killer whales, several of which are housed in tanks (equivalent to nine Olympic sized swimming pools) that are each known as Shamu Stadium. Shamu was the name of the first killer whale brought to SeaWorld San Diego in the 1960s from the Seattle Marine Aquarium. &#x27;Shamu&#x27; is now used as a stage name for killer whales in performances at SeaWorld parks. Currently, SeaWorld houses 18 killer whales in its three parks.

* Eight killer whales live at SeaWorld San Diego: Corky, Ulises, Orkid, Ikaika, Kalia, Keet, Shouka, and Makani.
* Five killer whales live at SeaWorld Orlando: Makaio, Malia, Trua, Katina, and Nalani
* Five killer whales live at SeaWorld San Antonio: Kyuquot, Takara, Sakari, Tuar, and Kamea.

Organizations such as World Animal Protection and the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society campaign against the captivity of dolphins and killer whales; SeaWorld, which holds most of the world&#x27;s captive killer whales, is cited for its role.

Killer whale captivity is a widely debated topic. Regarding anatomy, captive killer whales can exhibit collapsed dorsal fins. However, this trait has been witnessed in the wild and a prominent theory proposes this phenomenon can occur when any orcas live in relatively warmer conditions. Though, since captive orcas are more likely to breach, rising up to warmer waters, captivity itself can increase the temperature in which these whales live. Some evidence has shown that the condition can manifest in individuals after a month in captivity. Some argue that aggression among captive killer whales is common, whilst others claim that this also occurs in the wild. In August 1989, a dominant female killer whale, Kandu V, attempted to rake a newcomer whale, Corky II, with her mouth during a live show and smashed her head into a wall. Kandu V broke her jaw, which severed an artery, and then bled to death. In November 2006, a dominant female killer whale, Kasatka, repeatedly dragged experienced trainer, Ken Peters, to the bottom of the stadium pool during a show after hearing her calf crying for her in the back pools. In February 2010, an experienced female trainer at SeaWorld Orlando, Dawn Brancheau, was killed by killer whale Tilikum shortly after a show in Shamu Stadium. The whale had been associated with the deaths of two people previously. In May 2012, administrative law judge Ken Welsch upheld two Occupational Safety and Health Administration citations after Dawn Brancheau&#x27;s death, including one directly related to her death, and fined the company a total of $12,000. Trainers were banned from making close contact with the whales. In April 2014 the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia denied an appeal by SeaWorld. On December 22, 2015, an 18-year old SeaWorld orca, Unna, died from a fungal infection at the SeaWorld Park in San Antonio, Texas.

===&quot;Blackfish&quot;===

In 2013, SeaWorld&#x27;s treatment of killer whales in captivity was the basis of the film &quot;Blackfish&quot;, which documents the history of Tilikum, a killer whale captured by SeaLand of the Pacific (and later rescued by SeaWorld Orlando) who has been involved in the deaths of three people. In the aftermath of the release of the film, Martina McBride, 38 Special, REO Speedwagon, Cheap Trick, Heart, Barenaked Ladies, Trisha Yearwood, and Willie Nelson canceled scheduled concerts at SeaWorld parks.

====SeaWorld&#x27;s response====
SeaWorld disputes the accuracy of the film, calling it &quot;propaganda&quot; and &quot;emotionally manipulative&quot;. SeaWorld spent $15 million on an advertising campaign countering the allegations and emphasizing its contributions to the study of whales and their conservation.

In August 2014, SeaWorld announced it planned to build new killer whale tanks that would be almost double the size of the existing ones to provide more space for its whales, scheduled for completion in 2018. The company maintained the move was not in response to the release of the &quot;Blackfish&quot; documentary. Wild killer whales may travel up to 160 kilometres (100 mi) in a day and critics say the animals are too big and intelligent to be suitable for captivity.

In 2016 SeaWorld announced that they no longer had plans to complete the expansion project.

PETA, which opposes whales being kept in captivity, has proposed the theme park operator base its whales in seaside sanctuaries. The company also pledged $10 million in matching funds for killer whale research. The plans to increase the size of the tanks in San Diego were put on hold in October 2015 after the California Coastal Commission ruled that the work could only go ahead if they banned captive breeding, which would eventually lead to end of killer whale shows at the park.

On March 17, 2016, SeaWorld announced the end of their breeding program, which signifies the last generation of orcas in captivity in their care, though Takara was still pregnant at the time. Theatrical orca shows ended at SeaWorld San Diego in 2017 and ended in Orlando and San Antonio in 2019.

====Financial backlash====

In November 2014, SeaWorld announced that attendance at the parks had dropped 5.2% from the previous year, profits had fallen 28% over that quarter, and the company&#x27;s stock was down 50% from the previous year.

From 2014 to 2015, net income in the second quarter fell 84% from $37.4 million to $5.8 million, while revenue fell from $405 million to $392 million.

In February 2020, SeaWorld announced a $65 million settlement with investors who alleged that the company had deceived them about the documentary&#x27;s effect on park attendance.

==Animal rescue and rehabilitation program==
SeaWorld operates its conservation program in cooperation with the Department of the Interior, National Marine Fisheries Service and state agencies; its rescue and rehabilitation program was developed to comply with the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 and the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Since its inception SeaWorld Parks &amp; Entertainment has rescued and helped more than 40,000 animals, including ill, orphaned or abandoned and injured manatees, dolphins, pilot whales, sea turtles, and birds. As part of its animal rehabilitation program, SeaWorld has claimed the first birth of a killer whale in captivity, the first birth of a marine mammal via artificial insemination and the first hatching of captive green sea turtles. While acknowledging the value of these programs, critics and animal rights advocates have questioned SeaWorld&#x27;s balance of conservation and education alongside the commercial activities of its theme parks. In 1998, SeaWorld, with the help of the US Coast Guard, released the gray whale J.J. after the whale was rehabilitated at SeaWorld San Diego for 14 months.

Groups concerned for the health and safety of SeaWorld&#x27;s captive killer whale population have asked for the animals to be released. SeaWorld has defended their decision to keep the animals by citing their inability to survive in the wild after years of captivity.

==Response to drive hunt capture allegations==
In response to claims leveled at SeaWorld and other marine parks by the 2009 movie &quot;The Cove&quot; which accuses them of obtaining dolphins taken in drive hunts, SeaWorld spokesperson Fred Jacobs stated that, &quot;We think we&#x27;re being unfairly criticized for something we&#x27;re opposed to.&quot; It is illegal to bring drive hunt animals into the United States. He adds that, &quot;SeaWorld opposes the dolphin hunts documented in &quot;The Cove&quot;. We do not purchase any animals from these hunts. More than 80 percent of the marine mammals in our care were born in our parks. We haven&#x27;t collected a dolphin from the wild in decades.&quot; Since 1993, there have been no permits issued to facilities in the United States to import dolphins acquired through drive hunt methods. Marilee Menard, the executive director of the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums, has also stated that she believes that &quot;The Cove&quot; filmmakers are &quot;misrepresenting that the majority of zoos and aquariums with dolphins around the world are taking these animals.

<text>Robert Cannon &quot;Robin&quot; Hayes (born August 14, 1945) is an American politician and businessman from North Carolina. A member of the Republican Party, he represented North Carolina&#x27;s 8th congressional district in the House of Representatives from 1999 to 2009, and was the Republican nominee for Governor of North Carolina in 1996. Hayes served as chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party from 2011 to 2013, and from 2016 to 2019. Accused in a bribery scheme in 2019, Hayes pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. On January 20, 2021, Hayes was pardoned by President Donald Trump.

==Early life, education, and early political career==
Hayes was born in Concord, North Carolina, to Mariam Winslow (née Cannon) and Robert Griffith Hayes Jr. His great-grandfather James William Cannon founded the Cannon Mills Corporation, a Kannapolis-based textile company that was later run by his grandfather Charles Albert Cannon. He is also a descendant of Abraham Owen, a military officer killed at the Battle of Tippecanoe.

Hayes graduated from Duke University. He was elected to the Concord city council in 1978 and to the North Carolina House of Representatives in 1992 where he served two terms. He was the Republican nominee for governor in 1996, but was handily defeated by Democratic incumbent Jim Hunt. Hayes owns a hosiery mill in Mount Pleasant, North Carolina.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
;1998–2000
Hayes ran for Congress in 1998 after 12-term incumbent Democrat Bill Hefner announced his retirement. He narrowly defeated Democrat Mike Taylor, winning 51%–48% with a gap of only 3,400 votes. In 2000, he defeated Taylor in a rematch 55%–44%.

;2002–2004
Even though a large chunk of its population is located in the conservative-leaning eastern suburbs of Charlotte, the 8th has long been considered marginally Democratic due to a strong Democratic presence in the eastern portion of the district closer to Fayetteville. After the 2000 Census, the Democratic-controlled North Carolina General Assembly made the 8th considerably more Democratic than before. It shifted the heavily Republican western portion of Union County to the Charlotte-based 9th District. In its place, it added a heavily Democratic tendril in Mecklenburg County to the 8th, stretching from the far northeastern portion of Charlotte almost to Matthews.

In 2002, he defeated Democrat Chris Kouri 54%–45%. In 2004, he defeated Democrat Beth Troutman 56%–45%.

;2006

In 2006, however, Hayes was nearly defeated by Democrat Larry Kissell, a social studies teacher and former textile worker from Montgomery County. Each man won approximately 50% of the vote, making it one of the closest elections in the country. At the end, Kissell conceded defeat to Hayes after a recount; Hayes officially won the election by 329 votes. This was especially stunning since Kissell received little help from his national party until late in the campaign. Although Hayes only won three of the district&#x27;s nine counties, a 6,100-vote margin in his native Cabarrus County was enough to keep him in office.

;2008

In 2008, Hayes again faced Kissell. &quot;CQ Politics&quot; rated it as &#x27;No Clear Favorite&#x27;, &quot;The Rothenberg Political Report&quot; as &#x27;Toss-Up/Tilt Democratic&#x27;, and &quot;The Cook Political Report&quot; as &#x27;Republican Toss Up&#x27;

The Sunlight Foundation reported that as of 2008, among the 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives, Hayes had the highest amount of investment in oil stocks.

Hayes came under fire late in the campaign for his comments at a rally for John McCain. On October 18, 2008, at a McCain rally, Hayes began his remarks by saying it was important to &quot;make sure we don&#x27;t say something stupid, make sure we don&#x27;t say something we don&#x27;t mean.&quot; He then accused Obama of &quot;inciting class warfare&quot; and said that &quot;liberals hate real Americans that work and accomplish and achieve and believe in God.&quot; Hayes repeatedly denied that he had made the statement and accused reporters of &quot;irresponsible journalism&quot;, until an audio recording attesting to the statement was released. A few days later at a debate hosted by the Concord and Kannapolis Independent Tribune, Hayes denied that he denied the statement, saying he was denying only the context of how the remarks were presented to him.

Kissel defeated him 55%–45%.

===Tenure===
Hayes is a staunch advocate of a federal prohibition of online poker. In 2006, he cosponsored H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act.

;CAFTA and Trade Act
Hayes vacillated on the Central American Free Trade Agreement, which came before the House in 2005. In the weeks before the vote, Hayes stated that he was &quot;flat-out, completely, horizontally opposed to CAFTA&quot; because he felt it would cause further loss of textile industry jobs in his district. Hayes first voted &quot;no&quot; but changed to &quot;yes&quot; at the last minute after he was lobbied by Republican House leadership (specifically House Speaker Dennis Hastert) and textile executives, who favored CAFTA. Hayes said that he had won concessions from the George W. Bush administration on certain textile issues. The final tally was 217–215 with Hayes casting the deciding &quot;yes&quot; vote (a tie would have defeated the motion).

Hayes played a similar role in the passage of the Trade Act of 2002, which shifted some trade agreement authority from Congress to the President. Though Hayes had said &quot;We&#x27;re a definite &#x27;no&#x27; until we get some help on textiles,&quot; he was lobbied hard by the White House and congressional leadership to vote for the measure. Hayes waited until the last minute before voting &quot;yes,&quot; and broke down in tears on the floor of the House.

;NASCAR vaccine scare
In October 2007, it was revealed that House Homeland Security officials were &quot;advised&quot; to take vaccines before attending a NASCAR race in Concord, North Carolina. Hayes &quot;took umbrage&quot; when he heard about it and immediately defended the Charlotte Motor Speedway in his district and NASCAR fans nationwide. The uproar lasted for days and was covered on all major news outlets.

==North Carolina Republican Party chairmanship==
On January 15, 2011, Hayes was elected chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party. He completed the term of former Raleigh mayor Tom Fetzer, who decided to leave the post before his term expired. Hayes then served a full two-year term, and after the Republicans&#x27; successful 2012 election, he chose not to run for another term in 2013. In 2016, state Republicans removed their chairman, Hasan Harnett, and elected Hayes to return to the position.

===Bribery charge===

On March 18, 2019, a federal grand jury in the Western District of North Carolina indicted Hayes on charges of conspiracy to commit honest services fraud, wire fraud, bribery, and three counts of making false statements to federal authorities. According to the indictment, Hayes coordinated with businessman Greg Lindberg and two other individuals in an attempt to bribe Mike Causey, the North Carolina Commissioner of Insurance, in exchange for favorable treatment of Lindberg&#x27;s insurance firm and the dismissal of a deputy insurance commissioner. Lindberg was found guilty and sentenced to seven years in prison.

The indictment remained sealed until April 2, when Hayes appeared in court to plead not guilty. The following day he said that he would let other Republicans assume responsibility for managing the North Carolina Republican Party until its officer elections in June. Hayes kept the title of chairman until the new elections. At their annual convention in June, North Carolina Republican Party members elected a new chairman, Michael Whatley. Hayes pleaded guilty to lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation on October 2, 2019. President Donald Trump pardoned him on January 20, 2021.

<text>Family Re-Union was a series of conferences and a family policy initiative hosted by former Vice President of the United States Al Gore and second lady Tipper Gore, in Nashville, Tennessee. Launched in 1992 and continuing until 2008, its goal was to strengthen family life in America by bringing together families, experts, and policymakers to address critical issues like work-life balance, education, and healthcare.

There were thirteen conferences in total. The sixth Family Re-Union conference occurred on June 25, 1997, at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. President Bill Clinton gave remarks at the seventh conference on June 22, 1998. Bill Purcell also appeared at a conference.

<doc id="418740" wikidata="Q548048" url="?curid=418740" title="Belinda Stronach">
<text>Belinda Caroline Stronach (born 2 May, 1966) is a Canadian businesswoman, philanthropist, and former Member of Parliament (MP) from 2004 to 2008. Originally elected as a Conservative, she later crossed the floor to join the Liberals. From May 17, 2005, to February 6, 2006, Stronach was the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development and Minister responsible for Democratic Renewal in the government of Paul Martin. After leaving politics, she served as the executive vice-chair of Magna International, Canada&#x27;s largest automotive parts manufacturer, until December 31, 2010.

Stronach is the chair, chief executive officer and president of The Stronach Group and the founder and chair of The Belinda Stronach Foundation, a Canadian charitable organization. She also co-founded Acasta Enterprises and served as its director until 2017, when she resigned from the board.

In the early 2000s, Stronach was highlighted by the World Economic Forum and by media outlets such as the &quot;National Post&quot; and &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine as a promising future leader.

==Background==
Stronach was born in Newmarket, Ontario, Canada, to Austrian parents Elfriede Sallmutter and Frank Stronach, the Magna International founder and chairman. She graduated from Newmarket High School and in 1985 attended York University in Toronto, where she studied business and economics until dropping out after a year to work at Magna.

Stronach received an honorary Doctor of Law degree from Brock University in St. Catharines, Ontario in June 2009 for her charity work with Rick Mercer on Spread the Net.

== Career ==

=== Magna International ===
Stronach was hired by her father in 1985 to work at Magna International. She was a member of the board of directors from 1988 until 2004. In 1995, she became vice president of the company, then four years later was promoted to executive vice president and later president.

In February 2001, she was appointed CEO of Magna, succeeding Donald J. Walker, who became the CEO of Magna&#x27;s spinoff, Intier Automotive Inc. In January 2002, she also assumed the role of president. During her tenure as CEO, the company added 3,000 jobs in Canada, 1,000 of which were in the Newmarket-Aurora area, which she would later represent in Parliament. Under her leadership, Magna achieved record sales and profits each year. 

As CEO, Stronach was widely seen as more conciliatory toward organized labor than her father, who was known for his strong opposition to unions at Magna. During her tenure, she ended the company’s fight with the United Auto Workers in a dispute before the National Labor Relations Board. The union successfully organized numerous Magna workers in the United States.

She also chaired the boards of Decoma International Inc., Tesma International Inc., and Intier Automotive Inc., all within the auto parts sector.

Stronach was a founding member of the Canadian Automotive Partnership Council and served on the Ontario Task Force on Productivity, Competitiveness, and Economic Progress. Additionally, she served as a director of the Yves Landry Foundation, which supports technological education and skills training in the manufacturing sector.

In December 2010, Stronach resigned her position as executive vice-chairman and her position as board member at Magna International Inc. in what the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; called &quot;a surprise move that reflects a shift in boardroom power&quot;, after the Stronach family gave up control earlier in 2010.

=== The Stronach Group ===
After leaving Magna, Stronach and her father created The Stronach Group in mid-2011. As of March 2021, Stronach serves as Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of The Stronach Group. The Stronach Group is a horse racing, entertainment and pari-mutuel wagering technology company. The Stronach Group horse racing industry brands include: 

* Santa Anita Park
* &quot;The Great Race Place&quot; 
* Pimlico Race Course, home of the Preakness Stakes 
* Gulfstream Park, home to the $16-million Pegasus World Cup Invitational
* Laurel Park
* Golden Gate Fields, closed as of June 2024
* Portland Meadows
* Rosecroft Raceway

The Stronach Group uses pari-mutuel technology through its subsidiaries AmTote and Xpressbet and is a distributor of horse racing content to audiences through Monarch Content Management. Their consumer-facing brand, &quot;1/ST&quot; (pronounced &quot;first&quot;), is a dominant player in North American Thoroughbred horse racing. It holds nearly 20% of industry share and on a yearly-basis processes over USD $3.2 billion in wagers.

In response to an increase in incidents of injuries and horse fatalities, Stronach has pushed for reforms focused on horse and rider safety and welfare.

=== Other ventures ===
In May 2012, Anthony Melman and Stronach announced a partnership and established Acasta Capital Inc. Stronach stepped away from Acasta in July 2017.

In February 2016, together with business partners Holly Fennell, and Canadian marketing executive Beverley Hammond, Stronach launched Age Quencher Solutions, a line of all-natural beauty products. Belinda Stronach divested of her shares in Age Quencher Solutions in late 2017.

== Lawsuits ==
On October 2018, Frank Stronach and his wife filed a CAN$520 million lawsuit in Ontario Superior Court against their daughter, her children Frank and Nicole Walker, and Alon Ossip, former CEO of The Stronach Group. The lawsuit alleged that the defendants &quot;mismanaged the family&#x27;s chief assets and trust funds while forcing her father out of control of the fortune he created&quot;; additionally alleging that Belinda Stronach plotted with Ossip in &quot;a series of covert and unlawful actions…that have been contrary to the best interests of, and to the overwhelming detriment of, other members of the Stronach family.&quot;

Belinda Stronach filed a CAN$33 million counter-suit in January 2019, denying the alleged mismanagement and claiming she was protecting the family&#x27;s funds from her father&#x27;s investments in &quot;idiosyncratic and often unprofitable projects&quot;. 

Both suits were settled by August 2020, divying up the contested holdings. Belinda retained full control of The Stronach Group and related assets. Frank and Elfriede gained sole control of the remaining agricultural related businesses.

== Philanthropy and awards ==

On November 9, 2006, she co-chaired the Millennium Promise Convention in Montreal with Canadian television personality Rick Mercer. This event was a national campaign to enlist Canadians to help protect children in Africa from the effects of malaria. Together, Stronach and Mercer co-founded Spread the Net, a grassroots organization that raises money to buy insecticide-treated bed nets for families in Africa, reducing the risk of getting malaria by a mosquito bite. 

Stronach founded The Belinda Stronach Foundation in 2008. The foundation was established to support, develop and incubate projects and events confronting challenges related to youth, girls and women, development, and health. The foundation established project-based partnerships with The Tony Blair Faith Foundation, The Clinton Global Initiative, ONE, The Canadian Club of Toronto, The Economic Club of Canada, Malaria No More, and several other domestic and international organizations. In 2010, The Belinda Stronach Foundation brought the One Laptop Per Child Program to Canada. Now a standalone program, One Laptop Per Child Canada has delivered education technology to 9,000 Aboriginal students in 60+ communities in 9 provinces and 2 territories. The foundation appears to be closed as of 2020.

That same year, The Belinda Stronach Foundation developed and hosted the G(irls)20 Summit. Modeled after the G(20) Summit, The G(irls)20 Summit solicited grassroots ideas on how to reach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that most impact girls and women. The G(irls)20 Summit was launched in Toronto in 2010, followed by Paris, France in 2011. After the two successful summits, the G(irls)20 Summit became its own entity, separate from the foundation, and it continues to thrive today as an organization known as G(irls)20.

Alongside Newmarket Mayor Tony Van Bynen, Stronach established Belinda&#x27;s Place in 2015. Operated by The Salvation Army and the Regional Municipality of York, Belinda&#x27;s Place is a multi-service center for women who are experiencing homelessness and at risk of homelessness.

On November 20, 2014, Stronach co-chaired Covenant House Toronto&#x27;s Executive Sleep Out 2014 Edition with Tim Lieweke. Stronach, along with more than 80 other community and business leaders, spent the night sleeping outside to raise awareness and critical funds to support the programs and services that help youth transition from a life on the streets to a life of opportunity. The 2014 Sleep Out was the most successful in the three-year history, raising more than $939,000.

== Personal life ==
Stronach is twice divorced. Her first husband was former Magna CEO Donald J. Walker, and her second was Norwegian speed skater Johann Olav Koss. She has two children from her first marriage, Frank and Nicole Walker. Frank is a DJ performing as Frank Walker while Nicole is a national U25 champion equestrian.

=== Cancer diagnosis ===
In April 2007, Stronach was diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ, a form of breast cancer. She shared with the press that she had undergone a mastectomy on June 19 in an undisclosed Toronto hospital.

Stronach travelled to the California for a mastectomy and reconstruction surgery in June 2007 because the type of surgery was unavailable at the time in Canada. Following her experience, Stronach raised over a million dollars for the Belinda Stronach chair in Breast Cancer Reconstructive Surgery at the University of Toronto.

==Political career==
===Early political career===
In the 2000 Canadian Alliance leadership election, she supported Preston Manning. In his memoir &quot;Think Big&quot;, Manning recalls Stronach at his second-ballot campaign launch in Toronto delivering &quot;a substantive introduction in which she clearly explained why she wanted the Alliance and my candidacy to succeed&quot;, and he later thanked her for &quot;unflagging support&quot; in that campaign.

===Magna Budget===
In 2003, Ontario Premier Ernie Eves had his Minister of Finance, Janet Ecker, present the government&#x27;s budget at a televised press conference at Magna&#x27;s headquarters rather than before the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, as was the tradition. The &quot;Magna Budget&quot; resulted in accusations that the government was trying to avoid the scrutiny of the legislature and was flouting centuries of parliamentary tradition in favour of a PR stunt. Furthermore, the expense of this move was condemned as a waste of money considering that the legislative chamber was already equipped with video equipment for televised coverage. Speaker Gary Carr ruled that by not presenting the budget before the legislature, the Eves government was &quot;prima facie&quot; in contempt of the legislature—a ruling that was later overturned by the full chamber. The episode was a factor in the Tories&#x27; defeat in the provincial election held later that year.

===Conservative leadership bid===
Throughout the summer and into the fall of 2003, talks were undertaken by officials of the Canadian Alliance and Progressive Conservatives with respect to a merger of those parties. Vote-splitting between the two right-wing parties had enabled the Liberals to dominate Canadian politics for a decade. Meetings between the parties were overseen by a facilitator, who was later revealed to have been Stronach. She was among many who had called for PC leader Peter MacKay and Canadian Alliance leader Stephen Harper to undertake the merger talks in the first place.

In 2004, Stronach contested the leadership of the newly formed Conservative Party. As a candidate for leadership of the new party, she drew a great deal of publicity to the race. However, many in the media saw her first foray into politics as sophomoric. Some critics accused her of being a &quot;manufactured candidate&quot;, dependent on a high-priced network of professional campaign staff and Magna associates.

Some of the media reaction to Stronach&#x27;s candidacy was criticized. Casting Stronach as an &quot;heiress&quot; with a &quot;coddled career&quot; — to the point of joking comparisons to Paris Hilton— and the attention paid to her physical appearance and personal life, was described by a commentator as patronizing and sexist. Supporters touted her youth and style, corporate experience, private life as a &quot;soccer mom&quot;, and her potential to win new and swing voters, especially moderate, socially progressive voters in the province of Ontario.

On February 11, 2004, she declined to participate in a debate between the Conservative party candidates, leaving Tony Clement and Stephen Harper to debate each other on a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation broadcast. She later also skipped a March 14 debate on the Global Television Network. She argued that she ought only to participate in party-sponsored debates, rather than picking and choosing among those organized by outside sponsors. Critics saw this as her way of avoiding a debate with the other two candidates.

In her major speech at the leadership convention on March 19, 2004, she promised to serve only two terms if she became prime minister and to draw no salary. She made a major gesture of &quot;throwing away the script&quot;, but then undercut this when she was seen referring to cue cards. On March 20, 2004, she finished second to Harper with 23% of the vote.

In the 2004 federal election, she was narrowly elected as the MP for Newmarket—Aurora by a margin of 689 votes over Liberal Martha Hall Findlay. She was appointed the International Trade critic in the Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet.

===Political positions as an MP===
Before crossing the floor of the House of Commons, Stronach represented the socially progressive face of the Conservative Party. Along with Peter MacKay, she was seen as giving the Conservatives a more moderate image.

Stronach was generally to the left of her Conservative caucus colleagues, supporting abortion rights, gun control and same-sex marriage. During her Conservative leadership campaign, she called for a free vote in parliament, with votes cast individually and not along party lines, on same-sex marriage. She spoke and voted in favour of same-sex marriage when the issue came before the House of Commons in 2005; a position she re-affirmed as a Liberal in 2006. Social conservative elements in Canada were critical of Stronach, calling her a &quot;Red Tory&quot;. During Stronach&#x27;s leadership campaign, REAL Women of Canada said: &quot;If Ms. Stronach is elected as leader of the Conservative Party, social conservatives will no longer have a voice in Canada.&quot; Stronach, for her part, promised after the leadership race that she would do her best to keep the party from moving too far to the right. She cited discomfort with Stephen Harper and the Conservatives&#x27; policies as one of her reasons for crossing the floor.

Stronach supported trade with the United States but said she would like to re-examine and review parts of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to ensure, in her view, that Canadians can stand on a more equal footing with U.S. competitors. During her leadership campaign she said the country needed to consider changes to the Medicare system that would respect the principles of the Canada Health Act &quot;as our standard, not our straitjacket&quot;.

Stronach is a strong advocate of women&#x27;s issues. She was elected chair of the Liberal Women&#x27;s Caucus and spearheaded the development of &quot;The Pink Book&quot;, a policy framework that advocated a series of proposals to deal with the most pressing social and economic issues facing Canadian women. In 2005, she won the &quot;In Celebration of Women: Achievements and Initiatives&quot; award, and in 2010 she received the EVE award from Equal Voice in recognition of her philanthropic and political contributions to the promotion of women in public life.

===Crossing the floor===
In May 2005, Stronach suggested publicly that forcing an early election, especially before passing that year&#x27;s federal budget, was risky and could backfire on the Tories. Harper wanted to force an early election in the wake of testimony at the Gomery Commission damaging to the Liberals. The Tories planned to bring down the government by voting against an amendment to the budget that the Liberals had made to gain New Democratic Party (NDP) support. Since this would be a loss of supply, it would have brought down the government.

However, on May 17, 2005, two days before the crucial vote, Stronach announced that she was crossing the floor and joining the Liberal Party. Her decision to join the Liberals was facilitated by former Ontario Liberal Premier David Peterson. Stronach immediately joined the cabinet as Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development and Minister responsible for Democratic Renewal. In the latter portfolio, she was charged with overseeing the implementation of the Gomery Inquiry recommendations, upon their release. She championed the one-member, one-vote policy officially adopted by the Liberal Party of Canada in 2009 in an effort to democratize the Party&#x27;s leadership election process.

Her decision to quit the Conservative Party came after an uneasy relationship with Stephen Harper. In a press conference after leaving the party, she said that Harper was not sensitive to the needs of all parts of the country, and was jeopardizing national unity by allying himself with the Bloc Québécois to bring down the government. She also stated that the party was too focused on Western Canada and &quot;Western alienation&quot; instead of having a broader and more inclusive focus. She had other concerns about the Conservative attitude to Indigenous issues and that Stephen Harper was abandoning the historic Kelowna Accord negotiated by Paul Martin with First Nations&#x27; leaders and that Harper did not support an &quot;urban agenda&quot; that would recognize the challenges faced by Canada&#x27;s Big Cities. Her dislike for Harper was obvious in her press conference with Martin; she never once referred to him by name, only as &quot;the leader of the Conservative Party.&quot;

Stronach&#x27;s move shifted the balance of power in Parliament and allowed Martin&#x27;s Liberal minority government to survive for the time being. On May 19, 2005, two crucial confidence motions were voted on in the House of Commons. The first vote, on Bill C-43, the original budget proposal approved by all parties, was passed as expected, with 250 for and 54 against. The second vote was on a new budget amendment (Bill C-48) that included C$4.6 billion in additional spending the Liberals negotiated with NDP leader Jack Layton, to secure the support of NDP MPs. It was on this amendment that the Conservative/Bloc alliance planned to bring down the government. However, the vote resulted in a 152–152 tie. It then fell to the Speaker, Peter Milliken, to cast the deciding vote, which he cast in favour of continuing debate, resulting in the survival of the government. The vote carried with a final count of 153 for and 152 against. 

The Liberals used Stronach&#x27;s defection to paint the Conservative Party as being too extreme for moderate voters in Ontario. The Liberals enjoyed a modest upswing in the polls after earlier being damaged by testimony from Gomery Commission. Some political pundits suggested that shortly after Stronach&#x27;s defection would have been the ideal time for the Liberals to call the election, as Stephen Harper had lost some of his momentum after narrowly failing to bring down the government. Instead, the Liberals were forced into an election when they were brought down by a vote of non-confidence later that year, after revelations from the Gomery Inquiry damaged their popularity. Columnist Andrew Coyne suggested that while her defection helped the Liberals in the short-run to stay in power, it also made Martin appear as a &quot;grasping conniver willing to do and say anything to hang onto power&quot;.

====Reaction to Stronach&#x27;s move====
Stronach&#x27;s party switch mere days before the confidence vote made her the target of criticism within the Conservative Party and in the media in general. Many were cynical about her reasons for leaving and believed that her move to the Liberals was motivated more by ambition than by moral or political principles. In a press conference following the announcement, Harper speculated that Stronach had left the party simply to further her own career. At the same time, others praised Stronach for having the courage to leave a party in which she no longer felt comfortable.

Considerable media attention was paid to Peter MacKay, MP, and the deputy leader of the Conservative Party, with whom Stronach had a relationship of several months. Interviewed the day after Stronach&#x27;s departure from his party, he stated that he had learned of her intention to cross the floor mere hours before the public announcement. In an interview conducted at his father&#x27;s farm, MacKay showed discernible emotion.

The day after Stronach crossed the floor, the reaction in Newmarket—Aurora was mixed. Some of her constituents were upset and expressed a sense of betrayal. Protesters picketed her riding office for several days, demanding a by-election. However some of her constituents supported her move because they did not want an election and supported the budget.

Stronach&#x27;s move to the Liberal Party and the speed with which she was given a senior-level cabinet position renewed calls from both parliamentarians and the general public for legislation to prevent such &quot;party-hopping.&quot; One month after Stronach crossed the floor, a private member&#x27;s bill was tabled that would require a by-election to be held within thirty-five days of a member of parliament quitting a party. According to this proposed legislation, the MP would have to sit as an independent until the by-election. The legislation never became law.

NDP MP Pat Martin requested an investigation of Stronach, speculating that she had been promised a senior cabinet post in return for her defection. The Ethics Commissioner of Canada, Bernard Shapiro, refused to investigate her floor-crossing, citing that it was a constitutional right of a prime minister to appoint opposition members to Cabinet.

The Conservatives targeted Stronach for defeat in the 2006 election as part of their larger goal of a breakthrough in Ontario, especially in the Toronto suburbs (popularly known as the 905s). However, while the Conservatives won a minority government, Stronach defeated her Conservative challenger, Lois Brown, by an eight-point margin.

====Characterization in the media====
Some of the criticism of Stronach&#x27;s party switching also came under fire. Political scientist Linda Trimble has argued that the reaction to Stronach&#x27;s defection to the Liberals was &quot;offensive and sexist&quot;, referring to the comments of two provincial legislature members Ontario PC MPP Bob Runciman and Alberta PC Tony Abbott. Runciman told the Toronto radio station CFRB that, &quot;She sort of defined herself as something of a dipstick, an attractive one, but still a dipstick.&quot; He apologized for his comments and later elaborated, saying that Stronach failed to adequately express her reasons for defecting from the Conservative Party. Abbott said that Stronach had &quot;whored herself out for power.&quot; He apologized for the statement the next day saying that the term &quot;whoring&quot; had been misunderstood from context, and noting that it could be equally used for men and women.

Women&#x27;s groups argued that the media also unfairly characterized the transition. The &quot;National Post&quot; used the front-page headline &quot;Blonde Bombshell&quot;, and political cartoonists made reference to Stronach prostituting herself to the Liberal party. Stronach&#x27;s critics downplayed the sexism of their remarks and accused the Liberals of politicizing the issue to legitimize her crossing the floor.

She had defeated Lois Brown in the Conservative nomination election and barely won her seat in an extremely tight race against Martha Hall Findlay. Stronach&#x27;s switch to the Liberals meant that Hall Findlay had to forfeit contesting the nomination process, while Lucienne Robillard lost one of her portfolios to Stronach.

Since she started her career in politics, Stronach has made several television appearances poking fun at herself. This includes appearances on the CBC television comedy &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot; and a skate on the Rideau Canal with Rick Mercer for his series &quot;Rick Mercer Report&quot;. She also played a political reporter in the television mini-series &quot;H2O:The Last Prime Minister&quot;. In November 2005, she appeared on an episode of &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot;. At one point in the show, she remarked &quot;You know, I recommended to Stephen [Harper] once that to rise in his polls he should take a little Viagra but the pill got stuck in his throat and all he got was a stiff neck.&quot;

===As a Liberal MP===
Although the Liberals lost the 2006 federal election, Stronach won re-election as a Liberal candidate by a greater margin than she had in the 2004 election as a Conservative.

Following the Liberals&#x27; defeat in the 2006 election, Paul Martin announced that he would be stepping down as party leader. It was widely speculated that Stronach would seek the Liberal leadership at the 2006 leadership convention, having been endorsed by such Liberals as Reg Alcock and Brigitte Legault, who was head of the Quebec party&#x27;s youth wing.

However, on April 6, 2006, she announced that she would not seek the leadership, citing her objections to the delegate-based selection process. &quot;I could have raised the money, I was working on my French, but I realized that I was not going to be free to speak my mind on party renewal&quot;, said Stronach. She said that renewal would involve giving all party members a direct vote on its direction and leadership, among other things. &quot;If there was a one-member, one-vote system, I would run.&quot; However, a report by CTV reporter Robert Fife suggested that her candidacy was hampered by her weak grasp of French, one of Canada&#x27;s two official languages, and the fact that she believed the Liberals would be defeated in the next election. Several Liberal Party officials had also warned that they would enforce the new rules, which placed limits on donations and spending by contenders, which would have nullified Stronach&#x27;s largest advantage over other potential rivals.

===Not seeking re-election===
On April 11, 2007, Stronach announced that she would not seek re-election, and would instead return to Magna International as executive vice-chairman. This decision came at a time when Magna was in the midst of teaming up with Onex Corporation to consider a bid to buy Chrysler. Stronach further cited her wish to spend more time with her growing children, and the creation of a personal foundation to end poverty and disease in Africa. She retained her seat in Parliament until the federal election in the fall of 2008.

On December 21, 2010, it was reported that Stronach was leaving Magna effective December 31 of that year.

<text>John Howard Coble (March 18, 1931 – November 3, 2015) was an American politician who was the U.S. representative for , serving from 1985 to 2015. He was a member of the Republican Party. The district includes all or portions of ten counties in the northern-central part of the state, including portions of Greensboro and Durham.

==Early life, education, and pre-political career==
Coble was born in Greensboro, North Carolina, the son of Johnnie E. (Holt) and Joseph Howard Coble. After high school, he initially attended Appalachian State University, but after a year joined the United States Coast Guard, serving for over 5 years and staying on as a reservist for an additional 18 years. Upon discharging from military service, he attended Guilford College, from which he received a history degree. He was a member of the Epsilon Iota chapter of Pi Kappa Phi fraternity at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. Coble then moved on to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and earned a degree in law.

After graduating from college, Coble first worked as an insurance agent. He then spent nearly 20 years as a practicing attorney, and he was also Secretary of Revenue under North Carolina Governor James Holshouser. In 1979, Coble was elected to the North Carolina House of Representatives, serving until his election to Congress.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===

Coble was first elected to Congress in 1984, narrowly defeating Walter Cockerham in the primary 51%–49%. In the general election, he defeated one-term Democratic incumbent Robin Britt 51%–49%. Coble was likely the beneficiary of long coattails from Ronald Reagan, who carried the district by a nearly 2-to-1 margin. In 1986, he defeated Britt in a rematch, which was an even closer 50.03%–49.97% and Coble won by only 79 votes (closest margin of victory that year). He would never face another contest nearly that close, and would be reelected 13 more times with 61% or more of the vote. In July 2008, Coble won the Republican primary unopposed and became North Carolina&#x27;s longest-serving Republican U.S. congressman, surpassing former U.S. Congressman Jim Broyhill (who was also elected to 12 terms but left the House in July 1986 to fill a vacant U.S. Senate seat). Coble announced in 2013 that he would not run for another term in 2014, and would retire after 30 years in Congress.

===Tenure===
In the 105th United States Congress Coble moved to suspend the rules and pass the NET Act on November 4, 1997, which removed the requirement of financial gain for criminal prosecution of copyright violation. The NET Act was passed only after the House suspended the rules.

Coble was a strong supporter of agriculture and had voted in favor of bills to protect agriculture. Coble opposed further regulation of tobacco because he believed it would hurt North Carolina tobacco planters.

Coble took a hard-line position on illegal drugs, and co-sponsored a resolution to oppose the legalization and use of medical marijuana. He also voted for an amendment to authorize drug testing on federal employees. However, he authored a resolution to celebrate the passage of the Twenty-first Amendment, which repealed the Prohibition of alcoholic beverages in the United States. Coble was also a member of the Tea Party Caucus, joining Sue Myrick and Walter B. Jones as the sole members of the North Carolina Congressional delegation to join the group.

In June 2013, Coble announced introduction of new legislation to reform the congressional pension program. He stated that reforming congressional pensions was long overdue and that the bill would lengthen the time of service required before a member would be eligible for participation in the pension program. Coble himself pledged not to receive any pension from the United States government. He told CBS &quot;Up to the Minute&quot;, &quot;I figured taxpayers pay my salary – not a bad salary, and I figure that&#x27;s sufficient. Let me fend for myself after the salary&#x27;s collected.&quot; He also stated to CBS, &quot;I&#x27;ve pledged my assurance I won&#x27;t take the pension. That&#x27;s between my constituents and me. As far as convicted felons, I guess that&#x27;s between their constituents and themselves.&quot; He was one of two congressmen, with Ron Paul, to have pledged to decline his pension.

However, during the government shutdown in October 2013, Coble said that although 800,000 federal workers are furloughed and not receiving a paycheck, he would still collect his salary as a requirement of law. Coble was one of 87 Republicans who voted to end the shutdown.

===Legislation sponsored===
A bill to extend the Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988 for 10 years (H.R. 3626; 113th Congress) was introduced in the House on December 2, 2013, by Coble. The bill would extend the Act but would not expand any of its provisions (related to plastic guns). It passed the House on December 3, 2013.

Coble also sponsored the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), in 1997, a bill fundamental to the foundation of internet law. It would come into effect in the year 2000.

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on the Judiciary
** Subcommittee on Courts, Commercial and Administrative Law (chairman)
** Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, Competition, and the Internet
* Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure
** Subcommittee on Aviation
** Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation
** Subcommittee on Highways and Transit

===Caucus memberships===
* Congressional Fire Services Caucus
* Congressional Caucus on Turkey and Turkish Americans
* International Conservation Caucus
* Republican Study Committee
* Sportsmen&#x27;s Caucus
* Tea Party Caucus

==Personal life==
As a young man, Coble frequently enjoyed eating a breakfast of Rose brand pork brains in milk gravy and eggs. According to a quote from Coble appearing alongside his family recipe for &quot;Breakfast Brains N&#x27; Eggs,&quot; the breakfast was &quot;fairly regular&quot; and &quot;not at all unusual&quot;.

Coble was a member of the Guilford College Board of Visitors and of the U.S. Coast Guard Academy Board of Visitors.

He was a Freemason and member of Guilford Lodge number 656 in Greensboro.

Coble had skin cancer for many years among other ailments. He was admitted to intensive care in a Greensboro hospital in September 2015 after complications from skin cancer surgery, and died in the hospital from those complications on November 3, 2015, at age 84.

<doc id="418745" wikidata="Q2618373" url="?curid=418745" title="Split ergativity">
<text>In linguistic typology, split ergativity is a feature of certain languages where some constructions use ergative syntax and morphology, but other constructions show another pattern, usually nominative–accusative. The conditions in which ergative constructions are used vary among different languages. 

==Nominative–accusative vs. ergative–absolutive==

Nominative–accusative languages (including European languages, with the notable exception of Basque) treat both the actor in a clause with a transitive verb and the experiencer in a clause with an intransitive verb in the same way grammatically. If the language uses case markers, they take the same case. If it uses word order, it is parallel.

For example, consider these two English sentences:
* Jane was chasing Max.
* Jane was sweating.

The grammatical role of &quot;Jane&quot; is identical. In both cases, &quot;Jane&quot; is the subject.

In ergative–absolutive languages (such as Basque and Georgian, or the Eskaleut and Mayan languages), there is a different pattern. The patient (or target) of a transitive verb and the experiencer of an intransitive verb are treated the same grammatically. If the two sentences above were expressed in an ergative language, &quot;Max&quot; in the former and &quot;Jane&quot; in the latter would be parallel grammatically. Also, a different form (the &quot;ergative&quot;) would be used for &quot;Jane&quot; in the first sentence.

For example, in the following Inuktitut sentences, the subject &#x27;the woman&#x27; is in ergative case (&quot;arnaup&quot;) when occurring with a transitive verb, while the object &#x27;the apple&#x27; (&quot;aapu&quot;) is in absolutive case. In the intransitive sentence, the subject &#x27;the woman&#x27; &quot;arnaq&quot; is in absolutive case.
* &quot;Arnaup nirijanga aapu.&quot; &#x27;The woman is eating the apple.&#x27;
* &quot;Arnaq pisuktuq.&quot; &#x27;The woman is walking.&#x27;

In split ergative languages, some constructions pattern with nominative–accusative, and others with ergative–absolutive.

==Split conditions==
The split is usually conditioned by one of the following:

# The presence of a discourse participant (a first or second person) in the proposition. The Australian language Dyirbal behaves ergatively in all morphosyntactic contexts unless one of those is involved. When a first- or second-person pronoun appears, however, it is marked according to a nominative–accusative pattern (with the least-marked case, when it is the agent or intransitive, or with the most marked case, when it is the patient). That can be explained in terms of the high animacy of a first-person or second-person speaker in the animacy hierarchy.
# The use of certain aspects and/or tenses in the verb. The Indo-Iranian family, for example, shows a split between the perfective and the imperfective aspect. In Hindustani (Hindi-Urdu), a transitive verb in the perfective aspect causes its arguments to be marked by an ergative pattern, and the imperfective aspects trigger accusative marking.
# The type of marking involved. Some languages (including various Austronesian languages of New Guinea such as Sinaugoro) have an ergative–absolutive pattern with respect to case marking of nouns, but a nominative–accusative pattern with respect to agreement by means of person-marking affixes on the verb.
# The agentivity of the intransitive subject. In languages like Dakota, arguments of active verbs, such as &quot;to run&quot;, are marked like transitive agents, as in accusative languages, but arguments of inactive verbs, such as &quot;to stand&quot; are marked like transitive objects, as in ergative languages. Languages with such a marking are known as split-S languages and are formally a subtype of active languages.
# Pragmatic considerations or for emphasis, contrast, or clarity. In certain Tibeto-Burmese languages, elicited data has consistent ergative, aspectually split-ergative or active-stative case marking pattern, and in natural discourse the “ergative” marking is found only in some clauses, often a minority, usually with some pragmatic sense of emphasis or contrast (DeLancey, 2011).

==Examples==
===Hindi–Urdu===

An example of split ergativity conditioned by the grammatical aspect is found in Hindustani (Hindi-Urdu); in the perfective aspect of transitive verbs (in active voice), the subject takes ergative case and the direct object takes an unmarked absolutive case identical to the nominative case, which is sometimes called direct case. However, in all other aspects (habitual &amp; progressive), subjects appear either in the direct/nominative case or dative case (see dative subjects), while direct objects continue to appear in the direct case (the subject of such sentences is differentiated from the direct object not from a difference in case but from the agreement of the verb with the subject as well as other syntactic and contextual cues such as word order and meaning).

In the following perfective sentence, the agent &quot;laṛke-ne&quot; &quot;(boy)&quot; is marked for ergative case, while the undergoer &quot;kitāb&quot; &quot;(book)&quot; is in unmarked nominative case. The verb &quot;kharīdī&quot; (bought) has the feminine ending &quot;-ī&quot;, showing gender agreement with the undergoer &quot;kitāb (book)&quot;.

In the corresponding imperfective (habitual aspect) sentence, the agent &quot;laṛkā&quot; &quot;(boy)&quot; is in unmarked nominative case. The habitual participle form &quot;kharīdatā&quot; &quot;(buy)&quot; has the masculine ending &quot;-ā&quot; and thus agrees with the agent &quot;laṛkā (boy)&quot;.

Perfective constructions with certain VV (verb-verb) complexes do not employ ergative case marking (see: light verbs in Hindi-Urdu). In perfective constructions, the agent argument is ideally assigned with an ergative case; however in cases like the first example shown below that does not happen. This is because the explicator verb &quot;gayī&quot; (gone) which although undergoes semantic bleaching but still retains its intransitivity which does not allow for an ergative case assignment to the agent argument (i.e., &quot;ninā&quot;). This is why as shown in the second example below, VV complexes involving a transitive explicator verb (e.g., &quot;phẽkā&quot; &quot;threw&quot;) can employ ergative case to agent arguments.

===Chol (Mayan)===
The Mayan language Chol has split-ergative person marking.

In transitive clauses, verbs are framed by a person marking prefix (called &quot;set A&quot; in Mayan linguistics) that expresses the subject, and a suffix that expresses the object (= &quot;set B&quot;).
In intransitive clauses, the subject can either be represented by a set A-person marker, or a set B-person marker, depending on aspect.

In &quot;perfective&quot; aspect, Chol has &quot;ergative–absolutive&quot; alignment: the subject of the intransitive verb is expressed by a suffixed person marker, thus in the same way as the object of transitive verbs.
In &quot;imperfective&quot; aspect, Chol has &quot;nominative–accusative&quot; alignment: the subject of the intransitive verb is expressed by a prefixed person marker, thus in the same way as the subject of transitive verbs.
===Sahaptin===
In Columbia River Sahaptin, the split is determined by the person of both subject and object. The ergative suffix &quot;-nɨm&quot; occurs only for third-person subjects for which the direct object is in the first or the second person.



Another ergative suffix, &quot;-in&quot;, marks the subject in the inverse. Both subject and object are then always in the third-person.

Direct (same as above example):

Inverse:

<doc id="418746" wikidata="Q323446" url="?curid=418746" title="John Hawkwood">
<text>Sir John Hawkwood ( 1323 – 17 March 1394) was an English soldier who served as a mercenary leader or &quot;condottiero&quot; in Italy. As his name was difficult to pronounce for non-English-speaking contemporaries, there are many variations of it in the historical record. He often referred to himself as &quot;Haukevvod&quot; and in Italy, he was known as Giovanni Acuto, literally meaning &quot;John Sharp&quot; (or &quot;John the Astute&quot;) in reference to his &quot;cleverness or cunning&quot;. His name was Latinised as &quot;Johannes Acutus&quot; (&quot;John Sharp&quot;). Other recorded forms are &quot;Aucgunctur&quot;, &quot;Haughd&quot;, &quot;Hauvod&quot;, &quot;Hankelvode&quot;, &quot;Augudh&quot;, &quot;Auchevud&quot;, &quot;Haukwode&quot; and &quot;Haucod&quot;. His exploits made him a man shrouded in myth in both England and Italy. Much of his enduring fame results from the surviving large and prominent fresco portrait of him in the Duomo, Florence, made in 1436 by Paolo Uccello, seen every year by 4½ million tourists.

==Early life==
Hawkwood is believed to have been born in about 1323 at Sible Hedingham in Essex, the second son of Gilbert Hawkwood. Modern accounts often incorrectly portray him as living in poverty as a child, but Gilbert Hawkwood was, in reality, a tanner and minor landowner of &quot;considerable wealth&quot;. His father had property in both Sible Hedingham and Finchingfield. Other sources state that his father was a tailor, but this was likely a mistranslation from his Italianized name, Acuto (or sharp, as in needles). Lack of information has created many myths about his childhood. For example, the Florentine chronicler Filippo Villani claimed that the reason his last name was &quot;Hawkwood&quot; was because when his mother was in labour she demanded to give birth in a forest. However, he did not reside at his parental home for long, and he moved to London to be apprenticed to a tailor.

==Career==
Hawkwood began his career in the Hundred Years&#x27; War in France under King Edward III as a longbowman. It has been argued that he participated in both the Battle of Crécy in 1346 and the Battle of Poitiers in 1356. After Poitiers, he joined the White Company, an infamous band of mercenaries, with whom he crossed into Italy in 1361 and became its captain in 1363. Although Hawkwood was knighted, there is no clear evidence by whom or where. Some sources say he was knighted by the Black Prince after the Battle of Poitiers, but there is no historical record of this. In Italy, however, all major &quot;condottieri&quot; were classified as knights. After arriving in Italy he fought for numerous factions such as the Pope, Milan and Florence for the rest of his life, ending his career in Florence.

During Hawkwood&#x27;s career he was usually paid in gold florins, the most widely used currency of the time. In the 30 years that he served as a captain, Hawkwood&#x27;s earnings ranged between 6,000 and 80,000 florins annually (in comparison, a skilled Florentine craftsman at the same time earned 30 florins a year). 

===Mercenary in France===
After the Treaty of Brétigny on 8 May 1360, many free companies began to form. The largest, the Great Company (later popularly known as the White Company or the English Company), was formed in eastern France. Hawkwood joined this and eventually rose to be its commander. During his time, the band moved to Champagne, Burgundy, and eventually Avignon. The company seized Pont-Saint-Esprit near Avignon on the night of 28 or 29 December 1360, ultimately holding it for three months. This blocked the collection point for taxes to pay for the ransom of King John, who was taken in the Battle of Poitiers. Initially, Pope Innocent VI wrote to the group seeking peace, in a letter which identified Hawkwood as its leader. The group was unresponsive to the Pope&#x27;s plea and continued to harass the fort, which resulted in the company&#x27;s excommunication. In March 1361, the company and the Pope made peace through a deal to contract them to fight for him &quot;across the Pyrenees in Spain and across the Alps in Italy&quot;, with the promise of guaranteed military service, thus splitting the group. Hawkwood joined the group travelling to Italy.

However, before the company arrived in Italy under papal orders, it joined the Marquis of Montferrat and his war against Amadeus VI, ruling count of Savoy. It successfully attacked Savigliano and Rivarolo, and remained in Savoyan territory for a year. Amadeus made his last stand in 1362 in Lanzo and lost to the company. This victory motivated the Marquis of Montferrat to sign a contract with the company on 22 November, stating they would now fight the Visconti under him.

===Serving Italian factions===
Hawkwood and his company arrived in Italy during the power vacuum following the Great Schism of the papacy, and many different political figures were vying for power. The Pisan–Florentine War was the beginning of Hawkwood&#x27;s military career there, as he assumed command of the Pisan army in the winter of 1364–65, at the age of almost forty. The Battle of Cascina determined the war. Before the war, John Hawkwood and the Pisan army had met at Malatesta. Hawkwood&#x27;s tactics in this battle are what distinguished him as a military commander, even though he lost it. He took account of the terrain and conditions of the battlefield and positioned his army accordingly. However, the turning point came when the opposing commander ordered an enveloping move that cut Hawkwood off from the rest of his army. Hawkwood ordered his army to retreat. The modern perception of the battle is romanticised, as it is claimed as a heroic stand against great odds. Yet the defeat is likely to have been due to young, undisciplined soldiers fighting on Hawkwood&#x27;s side.

The second telling battle in Hawkwood&#x27;s career was Rubiera on 2 June 1372, fought between papal forces and Bernabò Visconti. Both sides had concluded a formal truce, but in reality, they were gathering more troops. Hawkwood and Visconti commanded a force of a thousand lancers with no infantry. The papal forces were larger: 1,200 lancers as well as infantry. Hawkwood outflanked and outmanoeuvred his enemy and took most of the high-ranking officers captive. The victory shows Hawkwood&#x27;s ability as a commander, although it had no significant political results and ended in a truce between the Visconti and the Pope.

One of Hawkwood&#x27;s more important roles was in the Great Raid on Tuscany, which shows the connections of the &quot;condottiere&quot; and the political prosperity of the Italian states. The raid led directly to war between Florence and Gregory XI and boosted Hawkwood&#x27;s career in fame and wealth. Frustrated by not being paid by the Pope, Hawkwood marched along the Via Emilia towards Tuscany and Florence. Two Tuscan ambassadors met him to conclude a truce, for which they paid him 130,000 florins. He continued to march through various territories, such as Pisa, Siena and Arezzo, where he continually pressed for money. Many believed these raids were under orders from the Pope, and so they led to a defensive league between Florence and Milan. Siena, Pisa, Lucca, Arezzo and Queen Joanna I of Naples soon followed and joined the defensive league against the company and the Pope. No matter who was responsible for the raid, Hawkwood&#x27;s raid proved the &quot;casus belli&quot;, which eventually led to the War of Eight Saints.

In the War of Eight Saints in 1375, Hawkwood and his company began fighting for Pope Gregory XI against Florence. In December, he went to Città di Castello on orders to put down a rebellion, but ended up capturing the city, which was not what the frustrated Pope had intended, but Hawkwood did so in an attempt to extract payment from the Pope. As a result, Gregory &quot;had little choice but to formally invest him with it, in return for uncompensated services.&quot; After capturing Città di Castello, Hawkwood rode to Faenza on 12 February 1376, on orders from the papal governor for protection because he feared revolt. While at Faenza, Hawkwood attempted to lay siege to the neighbouring town of Granarola, but was forced to retreat to Faenza. The papal governor opened the gates to Hawkwood, who once he had entered demanded that the inhabitants surrender their arms. Being unpaid by the Pope, they sacked the town instead. On hearing this, the opposing side, Florence, bribed Hawkwood not to fight and offered him a pension, as well as forgiveness for all betrayals and wrongdoings that he had committed against Florence. Yet Hawkwood remained with the Pope. Later he took part in the Massacre at Cesena, to which he was called to help enforce a decree promising forgiveness to citizens who laid down their arms. Thus Hawkwood and his men joined in the attack on the unarmed civilians. This was a turning point in Hawkwood&#x27;s career, after which he left papal service and began working with Milan, Florence and their allies.

Hawkwood would eventually sign a contract with Florence after a quarrel with his father-in-law, Bernabò Visconti. After winning a battle against John Horvatí, Hawkwood and Lutz Landau crossed paths with Horvatí and stole some prey from his hunt. Bernabò was unsettled with this, and consequently stripped Hawkwood of Milanese land received in his wife&#x27;s dowry. Thereafter Florence hired Hawkwood, the Landau brothers and their company for eight months, but the contract lasted much longer.

===Last years with Florence===
By 1385, Hawkwood was over 60 years old, with land holdings in both Italy and England. Although he was officially a citizen of Florence, he never was allowed to enter the city. Most of his duties under Florence were defensive, and he had not fought in a major battle for over a decade. However, in the winter of 1385–86, war broke out between Padua and Verona. The most important engagement in the war was the Battle of Castagnaro, which has been described as Hawkwood&#x27;s &quot;finest victory and one of the greatest feats of military prowess of the era&quot;. During the battle, Hawkwood saw that the Veronese&#x27;s left flank was exposed and ordered his men to advance, and in this way, secured victory for him and his Paduan allies. The &quot;Paduan Chronicle&quot; stated that 4,620 fighting men were captured.

Hawkwood&#x27;s role in the 1390–92 war against Milan was his last major military campaign. No new glory was won except for an exceptional and wise retreat while in Milanese territory. His last military deed was to help repulse an opposing mercenary company under Biordo Michelotti, Alberico Broglia di Chieri and &quot;other unemployed soldiers&quot;, which he and his men successfully drove back.

==Personal life==
Hawkwood had two wives. Little is known of the first, except that she was probably English, and she gave birth to at least one child, a daughter named Antiochia, who married into a prominent English Essex family, the Coggeshales. Through her daughter Alice Coggeshall, Hawkwood was an ancestor of the Earls of Inchiquin.

His second marriage is well documented. He was married in 1377 to Donnina Visconti, an illegitimate daughter of the great Milanese ruler Bernabò Visconti. It was a political match; she is described as a &quot;forceful character, in the mould of her father and the Visconti women in general&quot;. Some sources say that he was almost on equal terms with her which was very uncommon for that period of time, and he even let her run part of his finances. They had four children: Janet, Catherine, Anna and John.

It is also clear that Hawkwood had many mistresses and illegitimate children, like many men in his profession. Two of his documented illegitimate sons were John and Thomas Hawkwood. Hawkwood used favours from the Pope to obtain John an ecclesiastical appointment in London, while Thomas was taken hostage in 1376 in Bologna and returned to England, where he started a career as a mercenary captain.

===Education===
Some say that Hawkwood could neither read nor write, based on one event in which he had his contract with Florence read aloud to him in 1385. Yet this practice was not uncommon for captains of his status, and it should be suggested that he could read or write. In one correspondence with the Count of Armagnac, the Flemish chronicler, Jean Froissart, wrote that reading matter was either &quot;read or had read to him.&quot; Based on this, it is reasonable to claim some education for Hawkwood.

===Appearance===
Although descriptions of other &quot;condottieri&quot; exist, a consistent description of John Hawkwood is never clearly stated. In a modern account by Joseph Jay Deiss, Hawkwood is said to have been a &quot;heavy set sort, a young ox in the shoulders, powerful of arm and hand... His brown eyes were large, calculating and set wide apart under heavy brows. His nose was long, irregular and came to a point... His straight chestnut hair clung carelessly.&quot; The only clear source for Hawkwood&#x27;s appearance is a fresco by Paolo Uccello. The portrait is not a first-hand image, but a copy of an earlier portrayal. A physical description is hard to derive from it, as it shows Hawkwood sitting on a horse in partial armour. Recent scholarship has suggested, &quot;Hawkwood&#x27;s very pose is suspect... the composition was probably a piece of Florentine propaganda, intended to convey the image of the obedient captain conducting an inspection of troops.&quot; Given this information by various authors, there is no reliable description of his physical appearance, and evidence from pictures must be treated with caution.

===Personality===
During his life, the main traits used to describe Hawkwood were craft and brutality. Evidence of his craft was seen in his tactics, which included feigned retreats, ambushes and the use of false information. For example, before fleeing Milanese territory in 1391, Hawkwood accepted his opponent&#x27;s challenge to meet on the battlefield the next morning. However, Hawkwood &quot;picked up camp and quietly escaped through back routes, placing his battle standards and banners high on the trees so that the enemy would assume he was still there. He then detached a contingent of his men and placed them in the woods to entrap the enemy as it pursued [him].&quot; His troops would rape women, murder peasants and dismember their enemies. This has brought Hawkwood&#x27;s religious faith into question. He was known to sack monasteries and holy places, such as the Abbey of San Galgano. He even harassed the Pope in Avignon, but there is also evidence that he was not completely godless, as he requested a portable altar for Mass while on campaign. Geoffrey Trease gives &quot;fidelity&quot; as his main characteristic, because of his persistent commitment to fulfilling orders from his employers. However, this is untrue, as he often flouted contracts and disobeyed employers. In one case, he abandoned the Milanese army twice.

==Death==
Sir John Hawkwood died on 17 March 1394 at his home in Florence before he was able to retire to England. His funeral on 20 March was followed by an elaborate burial ceremony in the Duomo. It is recorded that the town fathers &quot;furnished three banners with the arms of Florence and a helmet with a golden lion holding a lily in its claw as the crest&quot;, and his personal brigade sent &quot;fourteen caparisoned warhorses, bearing the Englishmen&#x27;s personal banner, sword, shield and helmet.

==Memory and monuments==
Originally, under the Albizzi government, it had been intended to build a marble tomb for Hawkwood, but the money was lacking. In 1436, the Medici hired Paolo Uccello to paint the Duomo. Uccello painted a portrait of Hawkwood that survives today in the third bay of the northern wall. He is seen on a grey-green horse with a commander&#x27;s baton, dressed in partial armour. Uccello used a technique called &quot;terra verde&quot; to attempt to emulate a bronze statue in painting. The Latin inscription reads: &quot;Ioannes Acutus eques brittanicus dux aetatis suae cautissimus et rei militaris peritissimus habitus est&quot; (&quot;John Hawkwood, British knight, most prudent leader of his age and most expert in the art of war&quot;).

Hawkwood is also honoured at St Peter&#x27;s Church, Sible Hedingham, in England. The structure has canopied arches where there is a symbolic painting of a hawk on an arch, under which is a low altar, where there had also been a representative painting, now disappeared, of Hawkwood standing in prayer between his two wives. It had Hawkwood saying, &quot;Son of God, remember me&quot;, while the first wife said, &quot;Mother of mine, remember me&quot;, and the second wife, &quot;Mother of Christ, remember me&quot;.

==Popular culture==
*Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s 1891 novel &quot;The White Company&quot; is loosely based on John Hawkwood and his exploits.

The novel and all eight short stories have recently been collected for the first time.
*Gordon Dickson wrote a series of several novels called the &quot;Childe Cycle&quot; making reference to and featuring John Hawkwood as a character. The novels include &quot;The Final Encyclopedia&quot; (1984) and &quot;The Chantry Guild&quot; (1988).

*Hawkwood features in the novel &quot;The Red Velvet Turnshoe&quot; by Cassandra Clark, published by John Murray in 2009 as part of her &#x27;Abbess of Meaux&#x27; series.

=== Film ===
*The 1985 Paul Verhoeven fictional historical film &quot;Flesh and Blood&quot; features an English mercenary captain called &quot;Hawkwood&quot; (Jack Thompson), but is set in 1501, more than a century after the real John Hawkwood&#x27;s death.

<text>Old Navy is an American clothing and accessories retailing company owned by multinational corporation Gap Inc. It has corporate operations in the Mission Bay neighborhood of San Francisco, California. The largest of the Old Navy stores are its flagship stores, located in New York City, Seattle, Chicago, San Francisco, Manila, and Mexico City.

==History==

In the early 1990s, Dayton-Hudson Corporation (then the parent company of Target, Mervyn&#x27;s, Dayton&#x27;s, Hudson&#x27;s, and Marshall Field&#x27;s) looked to establish a new division branded as a less expensive version of Gap called &quot;Everyday Hero&quot;; Gap&#x27;s then-CEO Millard Drexler responded by opening Gap Warehouse in existing Gap outlet locations in 1993.

On March 11, 1994, Gap Warehouse was renamed Old Navy Clothing Co. to establish a separate image from its parent company Gap Inc. The name was conceived after the other original proposed names, &quot;Monorail&quot; and &quot;Forklift&quot;, were disliked by Drexler, and decided upon the new name after seeing a building with the two words on it during a visit to Paris. The new stores were about , compared to less than for Gap Warehouse stores. On March 11, 1994, the first Old Navy locations opened in the northern California towns of Colma, San Leandro and Pittsburg. According to Kevin Lonergan, Gap&#x27;s director of stores, Old Navy stores were intentionally designed like grocery stores, with flowing aisles, shopping carts, and small impulse items near the checkout counters. The cement floor, metal shelving, and checkout counters built from polished pressed board and galvanized metal gave the stores an industrial warehouse feel, while the colorful arrangements and large number of employees working set it apart from other discount clothing stores. Later that year, 42 other Old Navy stores opened, and most of the 45 Gap Warehouse stores were renamed Old Navy.

Old Navy had campy television ads featuring Carrie Donovan, Morgan Fairchild, and the mascot Magic, the dog.

The Old Navy division grew quickly; in 1997, it became the first retailer to pass $1 billion in its first four years in business, and opened 500 stores by 2000. In 2001, Old Navy began its international expansion with the opening of 12 stores in Ontario, Canada.

The brand also experimented, opening a coffee shop inside one location in San Francisco in December 1995, and opening an Old Navy Kids location in Littleton, Colorado, in April 1997. This in turn did not work out for the company, and was terminated the following September.
 
In 2005, Old Navy&#x27;s then-president Dawn Robertson looked to address the competition she saw in Hollister Co. and American Eagle Outfitters by rebranding the division with a &quot;high fashion feel&quot;. In addition to a new logo, several locations were built or remodeled to reflect the &quot;New Old Navy&quot;; one such location in St. Petersburg, Florida cost roughly $5 million to develop. Unlike the traditional industrial warehouse style most Old Navy locations possess, the new stores were boutique in nature, featuring green building materials, rock gardens, large murals, and posters, as well as many mirrored and silver accents. Also, advertisements began to be created in-house, and substituted the original kitschy and humorous feel for a high fashion and feminine directive. These stores proved to be a disappointing investment and Robertson was asked to leave the company.

In 2011, Old Navy began a second rebranding to emphasize a family-oriented environment, known as Project ONE. It targets Old Navy&#x27;s target customer (the fictional &quot;Jenny&quot;, a married mother of at least one child) and features better lighting, vibrant colors, layouts that make shopping easier, quick-change stations, and a more efficient cash wrap design. By July 12, 2011, one third of the company&#x27;s North American locations had adopted the redesign.

In 2012, after several years of Old Navy losing sales to rival retailer H&amp;M, Gap Inc. hired H&amp;M executive Stefan Larsson to run its Old Navy division. Larsson instituted a number of changes, including hiring designers away from Coach, Nike, Reebok, and North Face to design exclusive Old Navy clothing. By 2015, Old Navy&#x27;s yearly sales had reached $6 billion per year in the United States, almost equaling those of Gap Inc.&#x27;s Gap and Banana Republic divisions combined. Larsson left the company to join Ralph Lauren in 2015 and was replaced by current President and CEO, Sonia Syngal.

On October 26, 2017, Old Navy opened two new flagship stores (one in Times Square). The Times Square flagship caters to New York City crowds with extended store hours and significantly more retail space than the average Old Navy location.

On April 23, 2018, a customer, Saudia Scott filed a multi-million dollar lawsuit against Old Navy and its parent company Gap Inc. The lawsuit states that on July 25, 2016, Old Navy manager Megan Yost watched and assisted Scott with her purchases at the Old Navy store located in Abingdon, Harford County, Maryland. As Scott walked to her car, two police officers followed, detained and returned Scott to inside the store after Yost falsely accused Ms. Scott of theft and shoplifting. Manager Yost was terminated almost immediately as a result. A jury trial is scheduled for June, 2023.

In 2019, Gap Inc. announced that Old Navy would exit China in 2020.

On February 28, 2019, Gap Inc., announced that Old Navy and Gap Inc. would split into two companies, making Old Navy an independent company from Gap Inc. The move was designed to enable the consolidation of the company&#x27;s older brands, like GAP and Banana, with its newer Athleta and Hill City. This decision was reversed on January 16, 2020, when Gap Inc. announced that the separation had been aborted.

<doc id="418762" wikidata="Q134874" url="?curid=418762" title="Flag of Bolivia">
<text>The national flag of the Plurinational State of Bolivia was originally adopted in 1851. The state and war flag is a horizontal tricolor of red, yellow and green with the Bolivian coat of arms in the center. According to one source, the red stands for Bolivia&#x27;s brave soldiers, while the green symbolizes fertility and yellow the nation&#x27;s mineral deposits.
According to the revised Constitution of Bolivia of 2009, the Wiphala is considered a national symbol of Bolivia (along with the tricolor flag, national anthem, coat of arms, the cockade; kantuta flower and patujú flower).

Despite its landlocked status, Bolivia has a naval ensign used by navy vessels on rivers and lakes. It consists of a blue field with the state flag in the canton bordered by nine small yellow five-pointed stars, with a larger yellow five-pointed star in the fly. The nine small stars represent the nine departments of Bolivia, and the larger star the nation&#x27;s right to access the sea (access that it lost in 1884 in the War of the Pacific).

==Description==
===Design and dimensions===
The national flag of Bolivia is described as a tricolor rectangle, with the colors red, yellow and green, in a ratio of 1:1:1, meaning three horizontal bands, with the red on the superior part occupying a third of the flag&#x27;s width, yellow in the middle band using the same width, and green in the inferior part, using the last third.

The dimensions of the flag had not been defined since its adoption in 1851. Supreme Decree No. 27630 of 2004 finally established that the size of the national flag be of 7.5 squares width by 11 squares long, giving a ratio of 15:22.

===Color and symbolism===
The first description of Bolivia&#x27;s national flag, together with the significance of these, were first established by the Supreme Decree of 1888 during the government of President Gregorio Pacheco, which specifies that:
* 

The exact colors of the Bolivian flag have been established by the Supreme Decree of 2004:

The colours of the tricolor can also be found in the Bolivian Wiphala. The Wiphala has been included into the national colours of the Bolivian Air Force such as on the executive Dassault Falcon 900EX. The Wiphala is also officially flown on governmental buildings such as the and parliament alongside the tricolor since the introduction of the revised 2009 constitution.

==Historical flags==

The current Bolivian flag has been officially adopted 31 October 1851 during the presidency of Manuel Isidoro Belzu.&lt;br&gt;

According to Supreme Decree No. 27630 of 19 July 2004, during the presidency of Carlos Mesa, it was established that the civil flag used in civic, public and patriotic celebrations will be used without the National Shield, while the flag used by the state in official acts will include the shield in its center.

During the presidency of Evo Morales, through Supreme Decree No. 241 of 5 August 2009, some symbolic modifications were made to the flag. It was also established that for both the civil flag and the flag used by the State in official acts they should be raised on the right side and the wiphala on the left side.

<doc id="418763" wikidata="Q731097" url="?curid=418763" title="Erskine Bowles">
<text>Erskine Boyce Bowles (born August 8, 1945) is an American businessman and political figure from North Carolina. He served as the 19th White House Chief of Staff from January 1997 to October 1998, under President Bill Clinton, and as the president of the University of North Carolina system from 2005 to 2010. He also ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate in 2002 and 2004 to represent North Carolina.

In 2010, Bowles served as the Democratic co-chair of President Barack Obama&#x27;s National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform with Alan Simpson. Bowles and Simpson founded an advocacy group, The Campaign to Fix the Debt.

==Early life and education==
Bowles was born and raised in Greensboro, North Carolina, and is the son of Jessamine Woodward Boyce Bowles and Skipper Bowles, a Democratic politician who ran unsuccessfully for Governor of North Carolina in 1972. Siblings include Hargrove Bowles III, Mary Holland Bowles Blanton and the late Martha Thomas Bowles. Bowles graduated from Virginia Episcopal School before attending the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he was a member of the Zeta Psi fraternity and graduated with a business degree. After briefly serving in the United States Coast Guard, Bowles then enrolled in Columbia Business School, where he earned an MBA.

Following graduation, Bowles worked for the financial firm Morgan Stanley in New York City, where he met his future wife, Crandall Close. The two married in 1971 and moved to North Carolina, where Bowles worked on his father&#x27;s 1972 gubernatorial campaign. Crandall and Erskine have three children. In 1975, Bowles helped launch the investment banking firm of Bowles Hollowell Conner, and remained in the corporate sector until the 1990s.

==Clinton administration==
In 1992, Bowles became more involved in politics as a fundraiser for Bill Clinton&#x27;s 1992 presidential campaign. President Clinton appointed Bowles to head the Small Business Administration in 1993. From October 1994 to December 1995, Bowles served as Clinton&#x27;s White House Deputy Chief of Staff, in the first term of the Clinton Administration. After briefly returning to Charlotte, North Carolina, where he helped found the private equity firm, Carousel Capital, Bowles was appointed Clinton&#x27;s Chief of Staff in December 1996. One of Bowles&#x27;s major responsibilities was dealing with federal budget negotiations between the White House and Congress. Bowles returned to Charlotte, North Carolina and to the field of finance again in October 1998. He was also asked by North Carolina Governor Jim Hunt to head a task force on rural economic prosperity.
==Senatorial races==
Although initially reluctant to seek political office, Bowles reconsidered a run for the United States Senate after the September 11 attacks and, in October 2001, declared his candidacy for the Senate as a Democratic candidate. Seeking to fill the seat being vacated by Jesse Helms, Bowles secured the party&#x27;s nomination, but was defeated in the 2002 general election by Republican contender Elizabeth Dole.

In 2004, Bowles campaigned again for the Senate, seeking to fill the seat being vacated by fellow Democrat John Edwards. He faced Republican Richard Burr and Libertarian Tom Bailey in a hotly contested race. The final month of the Senate campaign saw both Bowles&#x27;s and Burr&#x27;s campaigns turn strongly negative, with Burr&#x27;s campaign attacking Bowles&#x27;s associations with the Clinton administration, while Bowles&#x27;s campaign attacked Burr on his support of trade legislation and special interest donations. Both campaigns spent a great deal of money, making it one of the most expensive statewide races in North Carolina history.

Despite an early lead in the polls after the primaries, as well as fellow Democrat Mike Easley running for a second term as governor at the top of the state party ticket, Bowles was defeated in the 2004 race as well. In 2005 Bowles accepted an appointment as United Nations Deputy Special Envoy for Tsunami-affected Countries, once again working for Bill Clinton who was now serving as U.N. Special Envoy.

==University of North Carolina==
On October 3, 2005, Bowles was elected by the University of North Carolina&#x27;s Board of Governors to succeed Molly Corbett Broad as President of the system, even though some suggest that the Board of Governors broke the law in not holding public hearings in the hiring process. One of his most significant appointments was that of Holden Thorp as the tenth chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who resigned on September 17, 2012 in the wake of several athletics-related scandals. Bowles also spoke at the campus memorial service in memory of slain student body president Eve Carson.

On February 12, 2010, Bowles announced his retirement from the UNC System. Bowles was replaced by Thomas W. Ross.

==Bowles-Simpson commission==

Bowles was appointed in 2010 to co-chair President Barack Obama&#x27;s National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform with Alan K. Simpson. The commission deadlocked, and the co-chairs&#x27; report on a policy for budget deficit reduction was not adopted by the Obama administration. Surprised by the rejection, Bowles later stated he believed that Obama decided to abandon the report and let [incoming House Budget Chairman] Paul Ryan go first, and then he would look like the sensible guy in the game, based on advice from his political advisers and over the objections of his economic team.

==Later career==

Bowles has been a member of the board of directors of General Motors, Morgan Stanley, Norfolk Southern Corporation,&lt;ref name=&quot;NSC 8-K 05/10/2012&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company and serves on the North Carolina Advisory Board of DonorsChoose.

On September 7, 2011, Facebook, Inc. announced that it had named Bowles to its board.

After North Carolina Governor Bev Perdue announced that she would not run for a second term in 2012, Bowles was mentioned as a possible candidate, and polling put him almost even with likely Republican nominee Pat McCrory. But on February 2, 2012, Bowles announced that he would not seek the governorship.

<text>The flag of Jordan, officially adopted on 16 April 1928, is based on the 1916 flag of the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire during World War I. The flag consists of horizontal black, white, and green bands that are connected by a red chevron. The colors are the pan-Arab colors, representing the Abbasid (black band), Umayyad (white band), and Fatimid or Rashidun caliphates (green band). The red chevron represents the Hashemite dynasty, and the Arab Revolt.

==Features==

In addition to the bands and chevron, a white star with seven points is featured on the hoist side of the red chevron. The star stands for the unity of the Arab people; its seven points refer to the seven verses of Al-Fatiha.

=== Construction sheet ===
Notice that, given the proportions of height and width of the red chevron, its sides are coincident with the diagonals of the flag.

<text>Ernesto Pastor Lavergne (April 4, 1892 - June 11, 1921) was the first of only two Puerto Rican-born bullfighters to gain international fame, the other being Juan Ramón Fernández.

==Early life and career==
Some date Pastor&#x27;s birth year as 1900, but it is generally accepted that he was born in 1892. He was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico to a Mexican father and French mother.
Pastor was considered by his contemporary colleagues to be talented both with the sword and the cape. 

===International success===
On January 15, 1911, he made his public debut, at a &quot;plaza&quot; in Guadalajara, Mexico. There, he would be revered as one of the best of his era.
Pastor relocated to Spain in 1916, fighting for the first time there on May 16, 1916, in Barcelona. In Spain, he was mentored by José Gómez Ortega. In 1918, Pastor engaged in 38 bullfighting spectacles, and in 1919, he debuted in Madrid.

==Death==
It was in Madrid on June 11, 1921, that Pastor met with death. On June 11, 1921, during a bullfighting event, his leg was gored by a bull. Bleeding profusely, he managed to ask &quot;who turned off the lights?&quot; before dying. The hemorrhage in his leg had caused him to go blind before dying.

<doc id="418774" wikidata="Q162033" url="?curid=418774" title="Flag of Bosnia and Herzegovina">
<text>The national flag of Bosnia and Herzegovina contains a medium blue field with a yellow right triangle separating said field, and there are seven full five-pointed white stars and two half stars top and bottom along the hypotenuse of the triangle.

The three points of the triangle stand for the three main ethnic groups (or &quot;constituent peoples&quot;) of Bosnia and Herzegovina: Bosniaks, Croats, and Serbs. The triangle represents the approximate shape of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The stars, representing Europe, are meant to be infinite in number and thus they continue from top to bottom. The flag features colors often associated with neutrality and peace – white, blue, and yellow. They are also colors traditionally associated with Bosnian culture and history. The blue background is evocative of the flag of Europe.

The Bosnian national flag is often used also for official purposes by the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, one of the constituent entities of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

==History==
=== Bosnian Banate from 1154 until 1377 ===
Used by Stjepan II Kotromanic.
=== Bosnian Kingdom from 1377 until 1463 ===
The flag of the Kingdom of Bosnia was based on coat of arms of the Bosnian dynasty Kotromanić, king Tvrtko I and his successors. The flag of medieval Bosnia was white with the coat of arms of the Kotromanić dynasty in the middle which consisted of a blue shield with six gold fleur de lys displayed around a white bend.

===Western Herzegovina 1760 flag===
The green flag with the white crescent and star pointing to the left was used by Bosniak landlords in border parts in southern and western Herzegovina. The flag was most commonly used in wars. It also accompanied the troops of the Eyalet of Bosnia during the second siege of Khotyn in Moldavia. It differs from Ottoman flag by size and direction of crescent, as well as its swallow-shape, similar to some West-European jacks and ensigns.
===Bosnian Revolt of 1830s flag===
In the 1830s revolt by Husein Gradaščević the green flag with a yellow crescent and star was used. The revolt&#x27;s aim was for Bosnia to gain autonomy from the Ottoman Empire.
===Austro-Hungarian rule===
When the Austro-Hungarian Empire annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina the flag was changed. The province of Bosnia used a flag that was a horizontal bicolour of red and yellow, but the province of Herzegovina used the same flag but with reversed colors (yellow and red).
The coat of arms is one of Stjepan Vukčić Kosača, Bosnian noble and duke from 14th century. The original medieval coat of arms had a white background and two red stripes in the top of the shield. It was Similar to the old flag of the Western Bosnian Flag. 
=== Yugoslav period ===
During the interwar period Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Bosnia and Herzegovina had neither a status within it nor a flag to go with. It was not until after World War II in Yugoslavia and disestablishment of the monarchy that this changed, as Bosnia and Herzegovina became its own republic within the newly established federal Yugoslavia.

Without constitutional recognition, the mid-war Federal State of Bosnia and Herzegovina first adopted the flag flown by Bosnian-Herzegovinian Partisans during the war—a wholly red flag with a narrowly gold-bordered red star in its centre, both symbolizing socialism and communism. The flag was usually accompanied on official buildings by the flag of the federal Yugoslavia and the flag of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. A smaller version of the flag served as the civil ensign while an elongated banner version was seen flown in front of the Yugoslav parliament.

Wide public discussion ahead of constitutional adoption resulted in the overall opinion that the state flag should be red, like the one initially flown by liberation movements, and not in national pan-Slavic tricolors of Serbs and Croats which were argued to have been an &quot;import&quot; from a later stage of the war. This discussion was in response to the first proposed flag from 15 November 1946, which matched the federal flag except with an additional golden star placed behind the existing gold-bordered red star in the centre, with their rays positioned interchangeably. Belgrade officials listened to the public opinion, but proceeded to add the federal Yugoslav tricolor to the canton of a plain red flag to symbolize the republic&#x27;s affiliation to the Federation, and as such it was officially adopted on 31 December 1946. In the real-world usage, this flag had a variant with a much larger canton which was offset from the edges and bordered in white. This variant was eventually proposed sometime in 1947, but was never adopted.

Bosnia and Herzegovina also had a new coat of arms during Yugoslav rule; it was a symbol of Bosnian industrialism at the time. A red flag with central elements of this coat of arms in the canton was erroneously reported in one contemporary book to have been the flag of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

=== Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1992–1998) ===

On 3 March 1992 Bosnia and Herzegovina declared its independence from Yugoslavia. Initially the newly independent Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina continued to use the flag of the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina until a new flag was adopted on 20 May 1992. The flag picked was the arms of the Kings of Bosnia Kotromanić dynasty, who ruled from 1377 until 1463 over the area that is present day Bosnia and Herzegovina and Dalmatia, consisted of a blue shield with six golden lilies displayed around a white bend; the golden lily is the Lilium bosniacum, which is a native lily to the area. The flag chosen in 1992 has a white background with the Bosnian lily in the center. It was and it still is the main Bosniak national flag. Though it is no longer an official flag of the state, the flag continues to be used unofficially by Bosniak civilians as their ethnic flag, used at football games, as part of political rallies, and other such events.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina after the Dayton Accords===
The Bosnian Serbs, before and after the signing of the Dayton Agreement, viewed the flag with the six fleurs-de-lys as only representing the Bosniaks (i.e. Bosnian Muslims) of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The flag of the state was eventually changed into the current, post-1998 flag. The current flag was introduced by the UN High Representative Carlos Westendorp after the Parliament of Bosnia and Herzegovina could not decide on a solution that was acceptable to all parties. Aside from the colors, the current flag contains no historical or other references to the Bosnian state. The flag is rarely ever seen in Republika Srpska, whose residents prefer to fly either that entity&#x27;s regional flag or the Serbian national flag instead. Some Bosniaks dislike or have no particular affinity for the flag, preferring the former Bosnian national flag used from 1992 to 1998, or the former socialist-era Yugoslav flag instead.

== Colour scheme==

== Alternative flag proposals ==
The first flag that was proposed in the First Set of Proposals was the &quot;Czech Pattern&quot;, similar to the flag of the Czech Republic. It was intended to represent all three constitutive nations living in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The next proposal was the &quot;Laurel branch&quot;. It is based on the light blue color of the United Nations Flag. It would have had a golden olive branch in the middle. The olive branch is taken from the United Nations emblem. The flag would have only one branch. The branch was rotated around 30 degrees counterclockwise. The third proposal was the &quot;Map&quot; proposal. It would also use the United Nations light blue color; however, there would be the addition of a white outline map of Bosnia and Herzegovina. No official text was ever published specifying the color of the outline, but it probably would have been white.

The Second Set of Proposals had flags that were truly representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a whole. The first flag design was a diagonally striped tricolor pattern of red to white to blue (different colors but in the same pattern as the Flag of the Republic of the Congo). In the centre there would be a blue map of Bosnia and Herzegovina outlined in yellow in the middle inside a circle of 10 five-pointed yellow stars. The flag would have been a 1:2 ratio. The second flag proposed was very similar except it had 12 five-pointed stars to represent the European Union. The Flag of Europe has the 12 five-pointed stars. The third design was a bit more different from the first two designs. The diagonal tricolur shape was kept, but the diagonal white stripe was made wider so that the angle was not perfectly 45 degrees. In the center there was a yellow map of Bosnia and Herzegovina outlined in green and under it there were two green olive branches. The olive branch pattern was the same one that the United Nations uses in its flag. The final fourth design was kept the same emblem from the third design, but did not have the diagonal stripes. Instead it had a horizontal tricolor pattern of blue, white, and red (from top to bottom), similar to that of the former Yugoslavia.

The first Westendorp alternative flag was a highly similar one to today&#x27;s flag, a diagonally divided top-hoist to bottom-fly yellow over light blue flag with line of 9 white five-pointed stars in the light blue field along the diagonal. The only major difference was that the color of the background was UN blue. The second Carlos Westendorp alternative flag is a light blue flag (using the United Nations&#x27; flag&#x27;s colors) with 5 bars interchangeably coming out of hoist and not reaching the other end. The colors are interchangeably yellow and white. In the third alternative flag, the field was light blue and had five narrow yellow bars.

Westendorp&#x27;s decision ended up being the first alternative flag. However, it was changed slightly to a darker blue, evocative of the European Union&#x27;s flag.

<doc id="418775" wikidata="Q1756325" url="?curid=418775" title="Serial digital interface">
<text>Serial digital interface (SDI) is a family of digital video interfaces first standardized by SMPTE (The Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers) in 1989. For example, ITU-R BT.656 and SMPTE 259M define digital video interfaces used for broadcast-grade video. A related standard, known as high-definition serial digital interface (HD-SDI), is standardized in SMPTE 292M; this provides a nominal data rate of 1.485 Gbit/s.

Additional SDI standards have been introduced to support increasing video resolutions (HD, UHD and beyond), frame rates, stereoscopic (3D) video, and color depth. Dual link HD-SDI consists of a pair of SMPTE 292M links, standardized by SMPTE 372M in 1998; this provides a nominal 2.970 Gbit/s interface used in applications (such as digital cinema or HDTV 1080P) that require greater fidelity and resolution than standard HDTV can provide. 3G-SDI (standardized in SMPTE 424M) consists of a single 2.970 Gbit/s serial link that allows replacing dual link HD-SDI. 6G-SDI and 12G-SDI standards were published on March 19, 2015.

These standards are used for transmission of uncompressed, unencrypted digital video signals (optionally including embedded audio and time code) within television facilities; they can also be used for packetized data. SDI is used to connect together different pieces of equipment such as recorders, monitors, PCs and vision mixers. Coaxial variants of the specification range in length but are typically less than . Fiber optic variants of the specification such as 297M allow for long-distance transmission limited only by maximum fiber length or repeaters. 

SDI and HD-SDI are usually available only in professional video equipment because various licensing agreements restrict the use of unencrypted digital interfaces, such as SDI, prohibiting their use in consumer equipment. Several professional video and HD-video capable DSLR cameras and all uncompressed video capable consumer cameras use the HDMI interface, often called clean HDMI. There are various mod kits for existing DVD players and other devices such as splitters that ignore HDCP, which allow a user to add a serial digital interface to these devices.

==Electrical interface==
The various serial digital interface standards all use (one or more) coaxial cables with BNC connectors, with a nominal impedance of 75 ohms. 

This is the same type of cable used in analog composite video setups, which potentially makes for easier &quot;drop in&quot; equipment upgrades (though may be necessary for long runs at the higher bitrates for older oxidising or lower grade of cable to replaced which may be replaced via optical fibre for long distance in modern use). The specified signal amplitude at the source is 800 mV (±10%) peak-to-peak; far lower voltages may be measured at the receiver owing to attenuation. Using equalization at the receiver, it is possible to send 270 Mbit/s SDI over without use of repeaters, but shorter lengths are preferred. The HD bitrates have a shorter maximum run length, typically .

Uncompressed digital component signals are transmitted. Data is encoded in NRZI format, and a linear feedback shift register is used to scramble the data to reduce the likelihood that long strings of zeroes or ones will be present on the interface. The interface is self-synchronizing and self-clocking. Framing is done by detection of a special synchronization pattern, which appears on the (unscrambled) serial digital signal to be a sequence of ten ones followed by twenty zeroes (twenty ones followed by forty zeroes in HD); this bit pattern is not legal anywhere else within the data payload.

===Standards===
===Bit rates===
Several bit rates are used in serial digital video signal:

* For standard-definition applications, as defined by SMPTE 259M, the possible bit rates are 270 Mbit/s, 360 Mbit/s, 143 Mbit/s, and 177 Mbit/s. 270 Mbit/s is by far the most commonly used; though the 360 Mbit/s interface (used for widescreen standard definition) is sometimes encountered. The 143 and 177 Mbit/s interfaces were intended for transmission of composite-encoded (NTSC or PAL) video digitally and are now considered obsolete.
* For enhanced definition applications (mainly 525P), there are several 540 Mbit/s interfaces defined, as well as an interface standard for a dual-link 270 Mbit/s interface. These are rarely encountered.
* For HDTV applications, the serial digital interface is defined by SMPTE 292M. Two bit rates are defined, 1.485 Gbit/s, and 1.485/1.001 Gbit/s. The factor of 1/1.001 is provided to allow SMPTE 292M to support video formats with frame rates of 59.94 Hz, 29.97 Hz, and 23.98 Hz, in order to be compatible with existing NTSC systems. The 1.485 Gbit/s version of the standard supports other frame rates in widespread use, including 60 Hz, 50 Hz, 30 Hz, 25 Hz, and 24 Hz. It is common to collectively refer to both standards as using a nominal bit rate of 1.5 Gbit/s.
* For very high-definition applications, requiring greater resolution, frame rate, or color fidelity than the HD-SDI interface can provide, the SMPTE 372M standard defines the dual link interface. As the name suggests, this interface consists of two SMPTE 292M interconnects operating in parallel. In particular, the dual link interface supports 10-bit, 4:2:2, 1080P formats at frame rates of 60 Hz, 59.94 Hz, and 50 Hz, as well as 12-bit color depth, RGB encoding, and 4:4:4 colour sampling.
* A nominal 3 Gbit/s interface (more accurately, 2.97 Gbit/s, but commonly referred to as &quot;3 gig&quot;) was standardized by SMPTE as 424M in 2006. Revised in 2012 as SMPTE ST 424:2012, it supports all of the features supported by the dual 1.485 Gbit/s interface but requires only one cable rather than two.

===Other interfaces===
SMPTE 297-2006 defines an optical fiber system for transmitting bit-serial digital signals It is intended for transmitting SMPTE ST 259 signals (143 through 360 Mbit/s), SMPTE ST 344 signals (540 Mbit/s), SMPTE ST 292-1/-2 signals (1.485 Gbit/s and 1.485/1.001 Gbit/s) and SMPTE ST 424 signals (2.970 Gbit/s and 2.970/1.001 Gbit/s). In addition to optical specification, ST 297 also mandates laser safety testing and that all optical interfaces are labelled to indicate safety compliance, application and interoperability.

An 8-bit parallel digital interface is defined by ITU-R Rec. 601; this is obsolete (however, many clauses in the various standards accommodate the possibility of an 8-bit interface).

==Data format==
In SD and ED applications, the serial data format is defined to 10 bits wide, whereas in HD applications, it is 20 bits wide, divided into two parallel 10-bit datastreams (known as Y and C). The SD datastream is arranged like this:

whereas the HD djjejatastreams are arranged like this:

; Y: 
; C: 

For all serial digital interfaces (excluding the obsolete composite encodings), the native color encoding is 4:2:2 YCbCr format. The luminance channel (Y) is encoded at full bandwidth (13.5 MHz in 270 Mbit/s SD, ~75 MHz in HD), and the two chrominance channels (Cb and Cr) are subsampled horizontally and encoded at half bandwidth (6.75 MHz or 37.5 MHz). The Y, Cr, and Cb samples are &quot;co-sited&quot; (acquired at the same instance in time), and the Y&#x27; sample is acquired at the time halfway between two adjacent Y samples.

In the above, Y refers to luminance samples, and C to chrominance samples. Cr and Cb further refer to the red and blue &quot;color difference&quot; channels; see Component video for more information. This section only discusses the native color encoding of SDI; other color encodings are possible by treating the interface as a generic 10-bit data channel. The use of other colorimetry encodings, and the conversion to and from RGB colorspace, is discussed below.

Video payload (as well as ancillary data payload) may use any 10-bit word in the range 4 to 1,019 (004 to 3FB) inclusive; the values 0–3 and 1,020–1,023 (3FC–3FF) are reserved and may not appear anywhere in the payload. These reserved words have two purposes; they are used both for Synchronization packets and for Ancillary data headers.

===Synchronization packets===
A synchronization packet (commonly known as the timing reference signal or TRS) occurs immediately before the first active sample on every line, and immediately after the last active sample (and before the start of the horizontal blanking region). The synchronization packet consists of four 10-bit words, the first three words are always the same—0x3FF, 0, 0; the fourth consists of 3 flag bits, along with an error correcting code. As a result, there are 8 different synchronization packets possible.

In the HD-SDI and dual link interfaces, synchronization packets &quot;must&quot; occur simultaneously in both the Y and C datastreams. (Some delay between the two cables in a dual link interface is permissible; equipment which supports dual link is expected to buffer the leading link in order to allow the other link to catch up). In SD-SDI and enhanced definition interfaces, there is only one datastream, and thus only one synchronization packet at a time. Other than the issue of how many packets appear, their format is the same in all versions of the serial-digital interface.

The flags bits found in the fourth word (commonly known as the XYZ word) are known as H, F, and V. The H bit indicates the start of horizontal blank; and synchronization bits immediately preceding the horizontal blanking region must have H set to one. Such packets are commonly referred to as End of Active Video, or EAV packets. Likewise, the packet appearing immediately before the start of the active video has H set to 0; this is the Start of Active Video or SAV packet.

Likewise, the V bit is used to indicate the start of the vertical blanking region; an EAV packet with V=1 indicates the following line (lines are deemed to start at EAV) is part of the vertical interval, an EAV packet with V=0 indicates the following line is part of the active picture.

The F bit is used in interlaced and segmented-frame formats to indicate whether the line comes from the first or second field (or segment). In progressive scan formats, the F bit is always set to zero.

===Line counter and CRC===
In the high definition serial digital interface (and in dual-link HD), additional check words are provided to increase the robustness of the interface. In these formats, the four samples immediately following the EAV packets (but not the SAV packets) contain a cyclic redundancy check field, and a line count indicator. The CRC field provides a CRC of the preceding line (CRCs are computed independently for the Y and C streams) and can be used to detect bit errors in the interface. The line count field indicates the line number of the current line.

The CRC and line counts are not provided in the SD and ED interfaces. Instead, a special ancillary data packet known as an EDH packet may be optionally used to provide a CRC check on the data.

===Line and sample numbering===
Each sample within a given datastream is assigned a unique line and sample number. In all formats, the first sample immediately following the SAV packet is assigned sample number 0; the next sample is sample 1; all the way up to the XYZ word in the following SAV packet. In SD interfaces, where there is only one datastream, the 0th sample is a Cb sample; the 1st sample a Y sample, the 2nd sample a Cr sample, and the third sample is the Y&#x27; sample; the pattern repeats from there. In HD interfaces, each datastream has its own sample numbering—so the 0th sample of the Y datastream is the Y sample, the next sample the Y&#x27; sample, etc. Likewise, the first sample in the C datastream is Cb, followed by Cr, followed by Cb again.

Lines are numbered sequentially, starting from 1, up to the number of lines per frame of the indicated format (typically 525, 625, 750, or 1125 (Sony HDVS)). Determination of line 1 is somewhat arbitrary; however, it is unambiguously specified by the relevant standards. In 525-line systems, the first line of vertical blank is line 1, whereas in other interlaced systems (625 and 1125-line), the first line after the F bit transitions to zero is line 1.

Note that lines are deemed to start at EAV, whereas sample zero is the sample following SAV. This produces the somewhat confusing result that the first sample in a given line of 1080i video is sample number 1920 (the first EAV sample in that format), and the line ends at the following sample 1919 (the last active sample in that format). Note that this behavior differs somewhat from analog video interfaces, where the line transition is deemed to occur at the sync pulse, which occurs roughly halfway through the horizontal blanking region.

===Link numbering===
Link numbering is only an issue in multi-link interfaces. The first link (the &quot;primary&quot; link) is assigned a link number of 1, subsequent links are assigned increasing link numbers; so, the second (&quot;secondary&quot;) link in a dual-link system is link 2. The link number of a given interface is indicated by a VPID packet located in the vertical ancillary data space.

Note that the data layout in dual link is designed so that the primary link can be fed into a single-link interface, and still produce usable (though somewhat degraded) video. The secondary link generally contains things like additional LSBs (in 12-bit formats), non-cosited samples in 4:4:4 sampled video (so that the primary link is still valid 4:2:2), and alpha or data channels. If the second link of a 1080P dual link configuration is absent, the first link still contains a valid 1080i signal.

In the case of 1080p60, 59.94, or 50 Hz video over a dual link; each link contains a valid 1080i signal at the same field rate. The first link contains the 1st, 3rd, and 5th lines of odd fields and the 2nd, 4th, 6th, etc. lines of even fields, and the second link contains the even lines on the odd fields, and the odd lines on the even fields. When the two links are combined, the result is a progressive-scan picture at the higher frame rate.

==Ancillary data==

Like SMPTE 259M, SMPTE 292M supports the SMPTE 291M standard for ancillary data. Ancillary data is provided as a standardized transport for non-video payload within a serial digital signal; it is used for things such as embedded audio, closed captions, timecode, and other sorts of metadata. Ancillary data is indicated by a 3-word packet consisting of 0, 3FF, 3FF (the opposite of the synchronization packet header), followed by a two-word identification code, a data count word (indicating 0–255 words of payload), the actual payload, and a one-word checksum. Other than in their use in the header, the codes prohibited to video payload are also prohibited to ancillary data payload.

Specific applications of ancillary data include embedded audio, EDH, VPID and SDTI.

In dual link applications, ancillary data is mostly found on the primary link; the secondary link is to be used for ancillary data only if there is no room on the primary link. One exception to this rule is the VPID packet; both links must have a valid VPID packet present.

===Embedded audio===
Both the HD and SD serial interfaces provide for 16 channels of embedded audio. The two interfaces use different audio encapsulation methods — SD uses the SMPTE 272M standard, whereas HD uses the SMPTE 299M standard. In either case, an SDI signal may contain up to sixteen audio channels (8 pairs) embedded 48 kHz, 24-bit audio channels along with the video. Typically, 48 kHz, 24-bit (20-bit in SD, but extendable to 24 bit) PCM audio is stored, in a manner directly compatible with the AES3 digital audio interface. These are placed in the (horizontal) blanking periods, when the SDI signal carries nothing useful, since the receiver generates its own blanking signals from the TRS.

In dual-link applications, 32 channels of audio are available, as each link may carry 16 channels.

SMPTE ST 299-2:2010 extends the 3G SDI interface to be able to transmit 32 audio channels (16 pairs) on a single link.

===EDH===
As the standard definition interface carries no checksum, CRC, or other data integrity check, an EDH (Error Detection and Handling) packet may be optionally placed in the vertical interval of the video signal. This packet includes CRC values for both the active picture, and the entire field (excluding those lines at which switching may occur, and which should contain no useful data); equipment can compute their own CRC and compare it with the received CRC in order to detect errors.

EDH is typically only used with the standard definition interface; the presence of CRC words in the HD interface make EDH packets unnecessary.

===VPID===
VPID (or video payload identifier) packets are increasingly used to describe the video format. In early versions of the serial digital interface, it was always possible to uniquely determine the video format by counting the number of lines and samples between H and V transitions in the TRS. With the introduction of dual link interfaces, and segmented-frame standards, this is no longer possible; thus the VPID standard (defined by SMPTE 352M) provides a way to uniquely and unambiguously identify the format of the video payload.

==Video payload and blanking==
The active portion of the video signal is defined to be those samples which follow an SAV packet and precede the next EAV packet; where the corresponding EAV and SAV packets have the V bit set to zero. It is in the active portion that the actual image information is stored.

===Color encoding===
Several color encodings are possible in the serial digital interface. The default (and most common case) is 10-bit linearly sampled video data encoded as 4:2:2 YCbCr. (YCbCr is a digital representation of the YPbPr colorspace). Samples of video are stored as described above. Data words correspond to signal levels of the respective video components, as follows:

* The luma (Y) channel is defined such that a signal level of 0 mV is assigned the codeword 64 (40 hex), and 700 millivolts (full scale) is assigned the codeword 940 (3AC hex) .
* For the chroma channels, 0 mV is assigned the code word 512 (200 hex), −350 mV is assigned a code word of 64 (40 hex), and +350 mV is assigned a code word of 960 (3C0 hex).
Note that the scaling of the luma and chroma channels is &quot;not&quot; identical. The minimum and maximum of these ranges represent the preferred signal limits, though the video payload may venture outside these ranges (providing that the reserved code words of 0–3 and 1020–1023 are &quot;never&quot; used for video payload). In addition, the corresponding analog signal may have excursions further outside of this range.

====Colorimetry====
As YPbPr (and YCbCr) are both derived from the RGB colorspace, a means of converting is required. There are three colorimetries typically used with digital video:
* SD and ED applications typically use a colorimetry matrix specified in ITU-R Rec. 601.
* Most HD, dual link, and 3 Gbit/s applications use a different matrix, specified in ITU-R Rec. 709.
* The 1035-line MUSE HD standards specified by SMPTE 260M (primarily used in Japan and now largely considered obsolete), used a colorimetry matrix specified by SMPTE 240M. This colorimetry is nowadays rarely used, as the 1035-line formats have been superseded by 1080-line formats.

====Other color encodings====
The dual-link and 3 Gbit/s interfaces additionally support other color encodings besides 4:2:2 YCbCr, namely:

* 4:2:2 and 4:4:4 YCbCr, with an optional &quot;alpha&quot; (used for linear keying, a.k.a. alpha compositing) or data (used for non-video payload) channel
* 4:4:4 RGB, also with an optional alpha or data channel
* 4:2:2 YCbCr, 4:4:4 YCbCr, and 4:4:4 RGB, with 12 bits of color information per sample, rather than 10. Note that the interface itself is still 10 bit; the additional 2 bits per channel are multiplexed into an additional 10-bit channel on the second link.

If an RGB encoding is used, the three primaries are all encoded in the same fashion as the Y channel; a value of 64 (40 hex) corresponds to 0 mV, and 940 (3AC hex) corresponds to 700 mV.

12-bit applications are scaled in a similar fashion to their 10-bit counterparts; the additional two bits are considered to be LSBs.

===Vertical and horizontal blanking regions===
For portions of the vertical and horizontal blanking regions which are not used for ancillary data, it is recommended that the luma samples be assigned the code word 64 (40 hex), and the chroma samples be assigned 512 (200 hex); both of which correspond to 0 mV. It is permissible to encode analog vertical interval information (such as vertical interval timecode or vertical interval test signals) without breaking the interface, but such usage is nonstandard (and ancillary data is the preferred means for transmitting metadata). Conversion of analog sync and burst signals into digital, however, is not recommended—and neither is necessary in the digital interface.

Different picture formats have different requirements for digital blanking, for example all so called 1080 line HD formats have 1080 active lines, but 1125 total lines, with the remainder being vertical blanking.

===Supported video formats===
The various versions of the serial digital interface support numerous video formats:

* The 270 Mbit/s interface supports 525-line, interlaced video at a 59.94 Hz field rate (29.97 Hz frame rate), and 625-line, 50 Hz interlaced video. These formats are highly compatible with NTSC and PAL-B/G/D/K/I systems respectively; and the terms NTSC and PAL are often (incorrectly) used to refer to these formats. (PAL is a composite color encoding scheme, and the term does not define the line-standard, though it is most usually encountered with 625i) while the serial digital interface— other than the obsolete 143 Mbit/s and 177 Mbit/s forms- is a component standard.
* The 360 Mbit/s interface supports 525i and 625i widescreen. It can also be used to support 525p, if 4:2:0 sampling is used.
* The various 540 Mbit/s interfaces support 525p and 625p formats.
* The nominal 1.49 Gbit/s interfaces support most high-definition video formats. Supported formats include 1080/60i, 1080/59.94i, 1080/50i, 1080/30p, 1080/29.97p, 1080/25p, 1080/24p, 1080/23.98p, 720/60p, 720/59.94p, and 720/50p. In addition, there are several 1035i formats (an obsolete Japanese television standard), half-bandwidth 720p standards such as 720/24p (used in some film conversion applications, and unusual because it has an odd number of samples per line), and various 1080psf (progressive, segmented frame) formats. Progressive Segmented frames formats appear as interlace video but contain video which is progressively scanned. This is done to support analog monitors and televisions, many of which are incapable of locking to low field rates such as 30 Hz and 24 Hz.
* The 2.97 Gbit/s dual link HD interface supports 1080/60p, 1080/59.94p, and 1080/50p, as well as 4:4:4 encoding, greater color depth, RGB encoding, alpha channels, and nonstandard resolutions (often encountered in computer graphics or digital cinema).
* A quad link interface of 3G-SDI supports UHDTV-1 resolution 2160/60p

==Related interfaces==
In addition to the regular serial digital interface described here, there are several other similar interfaces which are similar to, or are contained within, a serial digital interface.

===SDTI===

There is an expanded specification called SDTI (&quot;Serial Data Transport Interface&quot;), which allows compressed (i.e. DV, MPEG and others) video streams to be transported over an SDI line. This allows for multiple video streams in one cable or faster-than-realtime (2x, 4x...) video transmission. A related standard, known as HD-SDTI, provides similar capability over an SMPTE 292M interface.

The SDTI interface is specified by SMPTE 305M. The HD-SDTI interface is specified by SMPTE 348M.

=== ASI ===

The asynchronous serial interface (ASI) specification describes how to transport a MPEG Transport Stream (MPEG-TS), containing multiple MPEG video streams, over 75-ohm copper coaxial cable or multi-mode optical fiber.
ASI is popular way to transport broadcast programs from the studio to the final transmission equipment before it reaches viewers sitting at home.

The ASI standard is part of the Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) standard.

===SMPTE 349M===
The standard &quot;SMPTE 349M: Transport of Alternate Source Image Formats through SMPTE 292M&quot;, specifies a means to encapsulate non-standard and lower-bitrate video formats within an HD-SDI interface. This standard allows, for example, several independent standard-definition video signals to be multiplexed onto an HD-SDI interface and transmitted down one wire. This standard doesn&#x27;t merely adjust EAV and SAV timing to meet the requirements of the lower-bitrate formats; instead, it provides a means by which an entire SDI format (including synchronization words, ancillary data, and video payload) can be &quot;encapsulated&quot; and transmitted as ordinary data payload within a 292M stream.

===HDMI===
The HDMI interface is a compact audio/video interface for transferring uncompressed video data and compressed/uncompressed digital audio data from an HDMI-compliant device to a compatible computer monitor, video projector, digital television, or digital audio device. It is mainly used in the consumer area, but increasingly used in professional devices including uncompressed video, often called clean HDMI.

===G.703===
The G.703 standard is another high-speed digital interface, originally designed for telephony.

===HDcctv===
The HDcctv standard embodies the adaptation of SDI for video surveillance applications, not to be confused with TDI, a similar but different format for video surveillance cameras.

===CoaXPress===
The CoaXPress standard is another high-speed digital interface, originally design for industrial camera interfaces. The data rates for CoaXPress go up to 12.5 Gbit/s over a single coaxial cable. A 41 Mbit/s uplink channel and power over coax are also included in the standard.

<text>The national flag of Botswana (Setswana: &quot;folaga ya Botswana&quot;) consists of a sky blue field cut horizontally in the centre by a black stripe with a thin white frame. Adopted in 1966 to replace the Union Jack, it has been the flag of the Republic of Botswana since the country gained independence that year. It is one of the few African flags that utilises neither the colours of the Pan-Africanist movement nor the colours of the country&#x27;s leading political party.

== Design ==

The Republic of Botswana has a rectangular flag with a 2:3 ratio. Race is a very important feature of the flag. It was designed in order to contrast with the Flag of South Africa at the time when apartheid was in effect. The black band with the white frame has two meanings. They represent the harmony and cooperation between the people of different races who live in Botswana, as well as the racial diversity of the country.

The blue is associated with the sky, and water which is scarce. The country&#x27;s motto, &quot;Pula&quot;, means water, rain, and the life that is derived from it.

== History ==
In 1885, Botswana became a protectorate of the United Kingdom within its colonial empire, under the name of the Bechuanaland Protectorate. This occurred after the leaders of the Tswana people negotiated with the British to offer them protection from the Boers, who were invading their lands from the neighbouring South African Republic. Bechuanaland gained independence from Britain in 1966, and the new nation was renamed to Botswana. The new flag was first hoisted at midnight on 30 September 1966, the day Botswana became an independent country. It was designed to be distinct from the flag of South Africa, due to the country’s apartheid system. It is one of the few African flags that do not use the Pan-African colours or the colours of the flag of the dominant political party. 

From 1885 to 1966, Botswana&#x27;s flag was the Union Jack. Under British rule, there was also no official flag, coat of arms, or badge, though there was a seal.

== Protocol ==
Permission from the government is required to fly the flag. A formal request must be sent to the Permanent Secretary to the President of Botswana. It is recommended not to let the flag touch the floor, and to make sure it remains upright at all times. It is also recommended to follow the tradition of hoisting it at dawn and lowering it at dusk. The blue band should be placed at the top with the black band in the middle, and the white band at the bottom when displaying the flag vertically. The guidelines also state to lower the flag to half-mast to symbolise mourning or respect. If a flag gets damaged, there should be a burning ceremony. If burning is not an option, then it is recommended to &quot;dispose of the flag respectfully.&quot;

<doc id="418779" wikidata="Q329280" url="?curid=418779" title="Flag of the British Indian Ocean Territory">
<text>The flag of the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) is similar to the flags of other British dependencies and colonies as it has the Union Flag in the upper hoist-side corner. The palm tree and crown are symbols of the Indian Ocean Territory. The flag was initially intended to be used by the Commissioner but has gained semi-official status as a territorial flag for use on land.

==Overview==
The flag contains the Union Flag in its canton (upper hoist quarter). It depicts the waters of the Indian Ocean, where the islands are located, in the form of white and blue wavy lines. The flag also depicts a palm tree rising above the St Edward&#x27;s Crown. It is understood that the flag, which was granted by Queen Elizabeth II on the 25th anniversary of the BIOT in 1990, is that of the Commissioner and has only semi-official status.

Given that it is impossible for civilians to visit the British Indian Ocean Territory, it is not clear how widely this flag is used. However, a video released by the Naval Support Facility on Diego Garcia shows a scene where the flag is being flown on land within the territory. The only settlements on the Islands are the Anglo-American naval and air facilities.

The flag does indeed fly at Diego Garcia, along with the American Flag. Both are lowered at the end of the duty day.

The flag was designed for the Commissioner of the British Indian Ocean Territory. The Commissioner is based at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office in London.

<text>A headlamp is a lamp attached to the front of a vehicle to illuminate the road ahead. Headlamps are also often called headlights, but in the most precise usage, &quot;headlamp&quot; is the term for the device itself and &quot;headlight&quot; is the term for the beam of light produced and distributed by the device.

Headlamp performance has steadily improved throughout the automobile age, spurred by the great disparity between daytime and nighttime traffic fatalities: the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration states that nearly half of all traffic-related fatalities occur in the dark, despite only 25% of traffic travelling during darkness.

Other vehicles, such as trains and aircraft, are required to have headlamps. Bicycle headlamps are often used on bicycles, and are required in some jurisdictions. They can be powered by a battery or a small generator like a bottle or hub dynamo.

==History of automotive headlamps==

=== Origins ===
The first horseless carriages used carriage lamps, which proved unsuitable for travel at speed. The earliest lights used candles as the most common type of fuel.

=== Mechanics ===
==== Acetylene Gas headlamp ====

The earliest headlamps, fuelled by combustible gas such as acetylene gas or oil, operated from the late 1880s. Acetylene gas lamps were popular in 1900s because the flame is resistant to wind and rain. Thick concave mirrors combined with magnifying lenses projected the acetylene flame light. A number of car manufacturers offered Prest-O-Lite &quot;calcium carbide acetylene gas generator cylinder&quot; with gas feed pipes for lights as standard equipment for 1904 cars.

==== Electric headlamp ====

The first electric headlamps were introduced in 1898 on the Columbia Electric Car from the Electric Vehicle Company of Hartford, Connecticut, and were optional. Two factors limited the widespread use of electric headlamps: the short life of filaments in the harsh automotive environment, and the difficulty of producing dynamos small enough, yet powerful enough to produce sufficient current.

Peerless made electric headlamps standard in 1908. A Birmingham, England firm called Pockley Automobile Electric Lighting Syndicate marketed the world&#x27;s first electric car-lights as a complete set in 1908, which consisted of headlamps, sidelamps, and tail lights that were powered by an eight-volt battery.

In 1912 Cadillac integrated their vehicle&#x27;s Delco electrical ignition and lighting system, forming the modern vehicle electrical system.

The Guide Lamp Company introduced &quot;dipping&quot; (low-beam) headlamps in 1915, but the 1917 Cadillac system allowed the light to be dipped using a lever inside the car rather than requiring the driver to stop and get out. The 1924 Bilux bulb was the first modern unit, having the light for both low (dipped) and high (main) beams of a headlamp emitting from a single bulb. A similar design was introduced in 1925 by Guide Lamp called the &quot;Duplo&quot;. In 1927 the foot-operated dimmer switch or dip switch was introduced and became standard for much of the century. 1933–1934 Packards featured tri-beam headlamps, the bulbs having three filaments. From highest to lowest, the beams were called &quot;country passing&quot;, &quot;country driving&quot; and &quot;city driving&quot;. The 1934 Nash also used a three-beam system, although in this case with bulbs of the conventional two-filament type, and the intermediate beam combined low beam on the driver&#x27;s side with high beam on the passenger&#x27;s side, so as to maximise the view of the roadside while minimizing glare toward oncoming traffic. The last vehicles with a foot-operated dimmer switch were the 1991 Ford F-Series and E-Series [Econoline] vans. Fog lamps were new for 1938 Cadillacs, and their 1952 &quot;Autronic Eye&quot; system automated the selection of high and low beams.

Directional lighting, using a switch and electromagnetically shifted reflector to illuminate the curbside only, was introduced in the rare, one-year-only 1935 Tatra. Steering-linked lighting was featured on the 1947 Tucker Torpedo&#x27;s center-mounted headlight and was later popularized by the Citroën DS. This made it possible to turn the light in the direction of travel when the steering wheel turned.

The standardized round sealed-beam headlamp, one per side, was required for all vehicles sold in the United States from 1940, virtually freezing usable lighting technology in place until the 1970s for Americans. In 1957 the law changed to allow smaller round sealed beams, two per side of the vehicle, and in 1974 rectangular sealed beams were permitted as well.

Britain, Australia, and some other Commonwealth countries, as well as Japan and Sweden, also made extensive use of 7-inch sealed beams, though they were not mandated as they were in the United States. This headlamp format was not widely accepted in continental Europe, which found replaceable bulbs and variations in the size and shape of headlamps useful in car design.

Technology moved forward in the rest of the world. In 1962 a European consortium of bulb- and headlamp-makers introduced the first halogen lamp for vehicle headlamp use, the H1. Shortly thereafter headlamps using the new light source were introduced in Europe. These were effectively prohibited in the US, where standard-size sealed beam headlamps were mandatory and intensity regulations were low. US lawmakers faced pressure to act, due both to lighting effectiveness and to vehicle aerodynamics/fuel savings. High-beam peak intensity, capped at 140,000 candela per side of the car in Europe, was limited in the United States to 37,500 candela on each side of the car until 1978, when the limit was raised to 75,000. An increase in high-beam intensity to take advantage of the higher allowance could not be achieved without a move to halogen technology, and so sealed-beam headlamps with internal halogen lamps became available for use on 1979 models in the United States.
 halogen sealed beams dominate the sealed-beam market, which has declined steeply since replaceable-bulb headlamps were permitted in 1983.

High-intensity discharge (HID) systems appeared in the early 1990s, first in the BMW 7 Series. 1996&#x27;s Lincoln Mark VIII was an early American effort at HIDs, and was the only car with DC HIDs.

=== Design and style ===
Beyond the engineering, performance, and regulatory-compliance aspects of headlamps, there is the consideration of the various ways they are designed and arranged on a motor vehicle. Headlamps were round for many years because that is the native shape of a parabolic reflector. Using principles of reflection, the simple symmetric round reflective surface projects light and helps focus the beam.

==== Headlamp styling outside the United States, pre-1983 ====

There was no requirement in Europe for headlamps of standardized size or shape, and lamps could be designed in any shape and size, as long as the lamps met the engineering and performance requirements contained in the applicable European safety standards. Rectangular headlamps were first used in 1960, developed by Hella for the German Ford Taunus P3 and by Cibié for the Citroën Ami 6. They were prohibited in the United States where round lamps were required until 1975. Another early headlamp styling concept involved conventional round lamps faired into the car&#x27;s bodywork with aerodynamic glass covers, such as those on the 1961 Jaguar E-Type, and on pre-1967 VW Beetles.

==== Headlamp styling in the United States, 1940–1983 ====


Headlight design in the U.S. changed very little from 1940 to 1983.

In 1940, a consortium of state motor vehicle administrators standardized upon a system of two round sealed beam headlamps on all vehicles—the only system allowed for 17 years. This requirement eliminated problems of tarnished reflectors by sealing them together with the bulbs. It also made aiming the headlight beams simpler and eliminated non-standard bulbs and lamps.

The Tucker 48 included a defining &quot;cyclops-eye&quot; feature: a third center-mounted headlight connected to the car&#x27;s steering mechanism. It only illuminated if the steering was moved more than ten degrees off center and the high beams were turned on.

A system of four round lamps, rather than two, one high/low and one high-beam sealed beam on each side of the vehicle, was introduced on some 1957 Cadillac, Chrysler, DeSoto, and Nash models in states that permitted the new system. Separate low and high beam lamps eliminated the need for compromise in lens design and filament positioning required in a single unit. Other cars followed suit when all states permitted the new lamps by the time the 1958 models were brought to market. The four-lamp system permitted more design flexibility and improved low and high beam performance. Auto stylists such as Virgil Exner carried out design studies with the low beams in their conventional outboard location, and the high beams vertically stacked at the centerline of the car, but no such designs reached volume production.

An example arrangement includes the stacking of two headlamps on each side, with low beams above high beams. The Nash Ambassador used this arrangement in the 1957 model year. Pontiac used this design starting in the 1963 model year; American Motors, Ford, Cadillac, and Chrysler followed two years later. Also in the 1965 model year, the Buick Riviera had concealable stacked headlamps. Various Mercedes models sold in America used this arrangement because their home-market replaceable-bulb headlamps were illegal in the US.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, some Lincoln, Buick, and Chrysler cars had the headlamps arranged diagonally with the low-beam lamps outboard and above the high-beam lamps. British cars including the Gordon-Keeble, Jensen CV8, Triumph Vitesse, and Bentley S3 Continental used such an arrangement as well.

In 1968, the newly initiated Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108 required all vehicles to have either the twin or quad round sealed beam headlamp system and prohibited any decorative or protective element in front of an operating headlamp. Glass-covered headlamps like those used on the Jaguar E-Type, pre-1968 VW Beetle, 1965 Chrysler and Imperial models, Porsche 356, Citroën DS, and Ferrari Daytona were no longer permitted, and vehicles had to be equipped with uncovered headlamps for the US market. This made it difficult for vehicles with headlamp configurations designed for good aerodynamic performance to achieve it in their US-market configurations.

The FMVSS 108 was amended in 1974 to permit rectangular sealed-beam headlamps. This allowed manufacturers flexibility to lower the hoods on new cars. These could be placed in horizontal arrays or in vertically stacked pairs. As previously with round lamps, the US permitted only two standardized sizes of rectangular sealed-beam lamp: A system of two high/low beam units corresponding to the existing 7-inch round format, or a system of four units, two high/low and two high-beam. corresponding to the existing round format.

The rectangular headlamp design became so prevalent in U.S.-made cars that only a few models continued using round headlamps by 1979.

==== International headlamp styling, 1983–present ====
In 1983, granting a 1981 petition from Ford Motor Company, the US headlamp regulations were amended to allow replaceable-bulb, nonstandard-shape, architectural headlamps with aerodynamic lenses that could for the first time be made of hard-coated polycarbonate. This allowed the first US-market car since 1939 with replaceable bulb headlamps: the 1984 Lincoln Mark VII. These composite headlamps were sometimes referred to as &quot;Euro&quot; headlamps since aerodynamic headlamps were common in Europe. Though conceptually similar to European headlamps with non-standardized shape and replaceable-bulb construction, these headlamps conform to the headlamp design, construction, and performance specifications of US Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108 rather than the internationalized European safety standards used outside North America. Nevertheless, this change to US regulations made it possible for headlamp styling in the US market to move closer to that in Europe.

==== Hidden headlamps ====

Hidden headlamps were introduced in 1936, on the Cord 810/812. They were mounted in the front fenders, which were smooth until the lights were cranked out—each with its own small dash-mounted crank—by the operator. They aided aerodynamics when the headlamps were not in use and were among the Cord&#x27;s signature design features.

Later hidden headlamps require one or more vacuum-operated servos and reservoirs, with associated plumbing and linkage, or electric motors, geartrains and linkages to raise the lamps to an exact position to assure correct aiming despite ice, snow, and age. Some hidden headlamp designs, such as those on the Saab Sonett III, used a lever-operated mechanical linkage to raise the headlamps into position.

During the 1960s and 1970s, many notable sports cars used this feature such as the Chevrolet Corvette (C3), Ferrari Berlinetta Boxer and Lamborghini Countach as they allowed low bonnet lines but raised the lights to the required height, but since 2004 no modern volume-produced car models use hidden headlamps because they present difficulties in complying with pedestrian-protection provisions added to international auto safety regulations regarding protuberances on car bodies to minimize injury to pedestrians struck by cars.

Some hidden headlamps themselves do not move, but rather are covered when not in use by panels designed to blend in with the car&#x27;s styling. When the lamps are switched on, the covers are swung out of the way, usually downward or upward, for example on the 1992 Jaguar XJ220. The door mechanism may be actuated by vacuum pots, as on some Ford vehicles of the late 1960s through early 1980s such as the 1967–1970 Mercury Cougar, or by an electric motor as on various Chrysler products of the middle 1960s through late 1970s such as the 1966–1967 Dodge Charger.

== Regulations and requirements ==
Modern headlamps are electrically operated, positioned in pairs, one or two on each side of the front of a vehicle. A headlamp system is required to produce a low and a high beam, which may be produced by multiple pairs of single-beam lamps or by a pair of dual-beam lamps, or a mix of single-beam and dual-beam lamps. High beams cast most of their light straight ahead, maximizing seeing distance but producing too much glare for safe use when other vehicles are present on the road. Because there is no special control of upward light, high beams also cause backdazzle from fog, rain and snow due to the retroreflection of the water droplets. Low beams have stricter control of upward light, and direct most of their light downward and either rightward (in right-traffic countries) or leftward (in left-traffic countries), to provide forward visibility without excessive glare or backdazzle.

=== Low beam ===
Low beam (dipped beam, passing beam, meeting beam) headlamps provide a distribution of light designed to provide forward and lateral illumination, with limits on light directed towards the eyes of other road users to control glare. This beam is intended for use whenever other vehicles are present ahead, whether oncoming or being overtaken.

The international ECE Regulations for filament headlamps and for high-intensity discharge headlamps specify a beam with a sharp, asymmetric cutoff preventing significant amounts of light from being cast into the eyes of drivers of preceding or oncoming cars. Control of glare is less strict in the North American SAE beam standard contained in FMVSS / CMVSS 108.

=== High beam ===


High beam (main beam, driving beam, full beam) headlamps provide a bright, center-weighted distribution of light with no particular control of light directed towards other road users&#x27; eyes. As such, they are only suitable for use when alone on the road, as the glare they produce will dazzle other drivers.

International ECE Regulations permit higher-intensity high-beam headlamps than are allowed under North American regulations.

=== Compatibility with traffic directionality ===

Most low-beam headlamps are specifically designed for use on only one side of the road. Headlamps for use in left-traffic countries have low-beam headlamps that &quot;dip to the left&quot;; the light is distributed with a downward/leftward bias to show the driver the road and signs ahead without blinding oncoming traffic. Headlamps for right-traffic countries have low beams that &quot;dip to the right&quot;, with most of their light directed downward/rightward.

Within Europe, when driving a vehicle with right-traffic headlamps in a left-traffic country or vice versa for a limited time (as for example on vacation or in transit), it is a legal requirement to adjust the headlamps temporarily so that their wrong-side beam distribution does not dazzle oncoming drivers. This may be achieved by methods including adhering opaque decals or prismatic lenses to a designated part of the lens. Some projector-type headlamps can be made to produce a proper left- or right-traffic beam by shifting a lever or other movable element in or on the lamp assembly. Many tungsten (pre-halogen) European-code headlamps made in France by Cibié, Marchal, and Ducellier could be adjusted to produce either a left- or a right-traffic low beam by means of a two-position bulb holder.

Because wrong-side-of-road headlamps blind oncoming drivers and do not adequately light the driver&#x27;s way, and blackout strips and adhesive prismatic lenses reduce the safety performance of the headlamps, some countries require all vehicles registered or used on a permanent or semi-permanent basis within the country to be equipped with headlamps designed for the correct traffic-handedness. North American vehicle owners sometimes privately import and install Japanese-market (JDM) headlamps on their car in the mistaken belief that the beam performance will be better, when in fact such misapplication is quite hazardous and illegal.

=== Adequacy ===
Vehicle headlamps have been found unable to illuminate an assured clear distance ahead at speeds above 60 km/h (40 mph). It may be unsafe and, in a few areas, illegal to drive above this speed at night.

=== Use in daytime ===

Some countries require automobiles to be equipped with daytime running lights (DRL) to increase the of vehicles in motion during the daytime. Regional regulations govern how the DRL function may be provided. In Canada, the DRL function required on vehicles made or imported since 1990 can be provided by the headlamps, the fog lamps, steady-lit operation of the front turn signals, or by special daytime running lamps. Functionally dedicated daytime running lamps not involving the headlamps are required on all new cars first sold in the European Union since February 2011. In addition to the EU and Canada, countries requiring DRL include Albania, Argentina, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Czech republic, Colombia (no more from Aug/2011), Iceland, Israel, Macedonia, Norway, Moldova, Russia, Serbia, and Uruguay.

=== Construction, performance, and aim ===
There are two different beam pattern and headlamp construction standards in use in the world: The ECE standard, which is allowed or required in virtually all industrialized countries except the United States, and the SAE standard that is mandatory only in the US. Japan formerly had bespoke lighting regulations similar to the US standards, but for the left side of the road. However, Japan now adheres to the ECE standard. The differences between the SAE and ECE headlamp standards are primarily in the amount of glare permitted toward other drivers on low beam (SAE permits much more glare), the minimum amount of light required to be thrown straight down the road (SAE requires more), and the specific locations within the beam at which minimum and maximum light levels are specified.

ECE low beams are characterized by a distinct horizontal &quot;cutoff&quot; line at the top of the beam. Below the line is bright, and above is dark. On the side of the beam facing away from oncoming traffic (right in right-traffic countries, left in left-traffic countries), this cutoff sweeps or steps upward to direct light to road signs and pedestrians. SAE low beams may or may not have a cutoff, and if a cutoff is present, it may be of two different general types: &quot;VOL&quot;, which is conceptually similar to the ECE beam in that the cutoff is located at the top of the left side of the beam and aimed slightly below horizontal, or &quot;VOR&quot;, which has the cutoff at the top of the right side of the beam and aimed at the horizon.

Proponents of each headlamp system decry the other as inadequate and unsafe: US proponents of the SAE system claim that the ECE low beam cutoff gives short seeing distances and inadequate illumination for overhead road signs, while international proponents of the ECE system claim that the SAE system produces too much glare. Comparative studies have repeatedly shown that there is little or no overall safety advantage to either SAE or ECE beams; the two systems&#x27; acceptance and rejection by various countries is based primarily on which system is already in use.

In North America, the design, performance, and installation of all motor vehicle lighting devices are regulated by Federal and Canada Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108, which incorporates SAE technical standards. Elsewhere in the world, ECE internationalized regulations are in force either by reference or by incorporation in individual countries&#x27; vehicular codes.

US laws required sealed beam headlamps on all vehicles between 1940 and 1983, and other countries such as Japan, United Kingdom, and Australia also made extensive use of sealed beams. In most other countries, and in the US since 1984, replaceable-bulb headlamps predominate.

Headlamps must be kept in proper aim. Regulations for aim vary from country to country and from beam specification to beam specification. In the US, SAE standard headlamps are aimed without regard to headlamp mounting height. This gives vehicles with high-mounted headlamps a seeing distance advantage, at the cost of increased glare to drivers in lower vehicles. By contrast, ECE headlamp aim angle is linked to headlamp mounting height, to give all vehicles roughly equal seeing distance and all drivers roughly equal glare.

==== Light colour ====
=====White=====
Headlamps are generally required to produce white light, according to both ECE and SAE standards. ECE Regulation 48 currently requires new vehicles to be equipped with headlamps emitting white light. Different headlamp technologies produce different characteristic types of white light; the white specification is quite large and permits a wide range of apparent colour from warm white (with a brown-orange-amber-yellow cast) to cold white (with a blue-violet cast).

===== Selective yellow =====
Previous ECE regulations also permitted selective yellow light. A research experiment done in the UK in 1968 using tungsten (non-halogen) lamps found that visual acuity is about 3% better with selective yellow headlamps than with white ones of equal intensity. Research done in the Netherlands in 1976 concluded that yellow and white headlamps are equivalent as regards traffic safety, though yellow light causes less discomfort glare than white light. Researchers note that tungsten filament lamps emit only a small amount of the blue light blocked by a selective-yellow filter, so such filtration makes only a small difference in the characteristics of the light output, and suggest that headlamps using newer kinds of sources such as metal halide (HID) bulbs may, through filtration, give off less visually distracting light while still having greater light output than halogen ones.

Selective yellow headlamps are no longer common, but are permitted in various countries throughout Europe as well as in non-European locales such as South Korea, Japan and New Zealand. In Iceland, yellow headlamps are allowed and the vehicle regulations in Monaco still officially require selective yellow light from all vehicles&#x27; low beam and high beam headlamps, and fog lamps if present.

In France, a statute passed in November 1936 based on advice from the Central Commission for Automobiles and for Traffic in General, required selective yellow headlights to be fitted. The mandate for yellow headlamps was enacted to reduce driver fatigue from discomfort glare. The requirement initially applied to vehicles registered for road use after April 1937, but was intended to extend to all vehicles through retrofitting of selective yellow lights on older vehicles, from the start of 1939. Later stages of the implementation were disrupted in September 1939 by the outbreak of war.

The French yellow-light mandate was based on observations by the French Academy of Sciences in 1934, when the academy recorded that the selective yellow light was less dazzling than white light and that the light diffused less in fog than green or blue lights. Yellow light was obtained by dint of yellow glass for the headlight bulb or lens, a yellow coating on a colourless bulb, lens, or reflector, or a yellow filter between the bulb and the lens. Filtration losses reduced the emitted light intensity by about 18 percent, which might have contributed to the reduced glare.

The mandate was in effect until December 1992, so for many years yellow headlights visually marked French-registered cars wherever they were seen, though some French drivers are said to have switched to white headlamps despite the requirement for yellow ones.

The requirement was criticised as a trade barrier in the automobile sector; French politician Jean-Claude Martinez described it as a protectionist law.

Formal research found, at best, a small improvement in visual acuity with yellow rather than white headlights, and French automaker Peugeot estimated that white headlamps produce 20 to 30 percent more light—though without explaining why this estimate was larger than the 15% to 18% value measured in formal research—and wanted drivers of their cars to get the benefits of extra illumination. More generally, country-specific vehicle technical regulations in Europe were regarded as a costly nuisance. In a survey published in 1988, automakers gave a range of responses when asked what it cost to supply a car with yellow headlamps for France. General Motors and Lotus said there was no additional cost, Rover said the additional cost was marginal, and Volkswagen said yellow headlamps added 28 Deutsche Marks to the cost of vehicle production. Addressing the French requirement for yellow lights (among other country-specific lighting requirements) was undertaken as part of an effort toward common vehicle technical standards throughout the European Community. A provision in EU Council Directive 91/663, issued on 10 December 1991, specified white headlamps for all new vehicle type-approvals granted by the EC after 1 January 1993 and stipulated that from that date EC (later EU) member states would not be permitted to refuse entry of a vehicle meeting the lighting standards contained in the amended document—so France would no longer be able to refuse entry to a vehicle with white headlights. The directive was adopted unanimously by the council, and hence with France&#x27;s vote.

Though no longer required in France, selective yellow headlamps remain legal there; the current regulation stipulates that &quot;every motor vehicle must be equipped, at the front, with two or four lights, creating in a forward direction selective yellow or white light permitting efficient illumination of the road at night for a distance, in clear conditions, of 100 metres&quot;.

== Optical systems ==
=== Reflector lamps ===

==== Lens optics ====
A light source (filament or arc) is placed at or near the focus of a reflector, which may be parabolic or of non-parabolic complex shape. Fresnel and prism optics moulded into the headlamp lens refract (shift) parts of the light laterally and vertically to provide the required light distribution pattern. Most sealed-beam headlamps have lens optics.
==== Reflector optics ====
Starting in the 1980s, headlamp reflectors began to evolve beyond the simple stamped steel parabola. The 1983 Austin Maestro was the first vehicle equipped with Lucas-Carello&#x27;s &quot;homofocal&quot; reflectors, which comprised parabolic sections of different focal length to improve the efficiency of light collection and distribution. CAD technology allowed the development of reflector headlamps with nonparabolic, complex-shape reflectors. First commercialised by Valeo under their Cibié brand, these headlamps would revolutionise automobile design.

The 1987 US-market Dodge Monaco/Eagle Premier twins and European Citroën XM were the first cars with complex-reflector headlamps with faceted optic lenses. General Motors&#x27; Guide Lamp division in America had experimented with clear-lens complex-reflector lamps in the early 1970s and achieved promising results, but the US-market 1990 Honda Accord was first with clear-lens multi-reflector headlamps; these were developed by Stanley in Japan.

The optics to distribute the light in the desired pattern are designed into the reflector itself, rather than into the lens. Depending on the development tools and techniques in use, the reflector may be engineered from the start as a bespoke shape, or it may start as a parabola standing in for the size and shape of the completed package. In the latter case, the entire surface area is modified so as to produce individual segments of specifically calculated, complex contours. The shape of each segment is designed such that their cumulative effect produces the required light distribution pattern.

Modern reflectors are commonly made of compression-moulded or injection moulded plastic, though glass and metal optic reflectors also exist. The reflective surface is vapour deposited aluminum, with a clear overcoating to prevent the extremely thin aluminium from oxidizing. Extremely tight tolerances must be maintained in the design and production of complex-reflector headlamps.
===== Dual-beam reflector headlamps =====
Night driving is difficult and dangerous due to the blinding glare of headlights from oncoming traffic. Headlamps that satisfactorily illuminate the road ahead without causing glare have long been sought. The first solutions involved resistance-type dimming circuits, which decreased the intensity of the headlamps. This yielded to tilting reflectors, and later to dual-filament bulbs with a high and a low beam.

In a two-filament headlamp, there can only be one filament exactly at the focal point of the reflector. There are two primary means of producing two different beams from a two-filament bulb in a single reflector.

====== American system ======
One filament is located at the focal point of the reflector. The other filament is shifted axially and radially away from the focal point. In most 2-filament sealed beams and in 2-filament replaceable bulbs of type 9004, 9007, and H13, the high-beam filament is at the focal point and the low-beam filament is off focus. For use in right-traffic countries, the low-beam filament is positioned slightly upward, forward, and leftward of the focal point, so that when it is energized, the beam is widened and shifted slightly downward and rightward of the headlamp axis. Transverse-filament bulbs such as the 9004 can only be used with the filaments horizontal, but axial-filament bulbs can be rotated or &quot;clocked&quot; by the headlamp designer to optimize the beam pattern or to affect the traffic-handedness of the low beam. The latter is accomplished by clocking the low-beam filament in an upward-forward-leftward position to produce a right-traffic low beam, or in an upward-forward-rightward position to produce a left-traffic low beam.

The opposite tactic has also been employed in certain two-filament sealed beams. Placing the low beam filament at the focal point to maximize light collection by the reflector, and positioning the high beam filament slightly rearward-rightward-downward of the focal point. The relative directional shift between the two beams is the same with either technique – in a right-traffic country, the low beam is slightly downward-rightward and the high beam is slightly upward-leftward, relative to one another – but the lens optics must be matched to the filament placements selected.

====== European system ======
The traditional European method of achieving low and high beams from a single bulb involves two filaments along the axis of the reflector. The high beam filament is on the focal point, while the low beam filament is approximately 1 cm forward of the focal point and 3 mm above the axis. Below the low beam filament is a cup-shaped shield (called a &quot;Graves shield&quot;) spanning an arc of 165°. When the low beam filament is illuminated, this shield casts a shadow on the corresponding lower area of the reflector, blocking downward light rays that would otherwise strike the reflector and be cast above the horizon. The bulb is rotated (or &quot;clocked&quot;) within the headlamp to position the Graves shield so as to allow light to strike a 15° wedge of the lower half of the reflector. This is used to create the upsweep or upstep characteristic of ECE low beam light distributions. The bulb&#x27;s rotative position within the reflector depends on the type of beam pattern to be produced and the traffic directionality of the market for which the headlamp is intended.

This system was first used with the tungsten incandescent Bilux/Duplo R2 bulb of 1954, and later with the halogen H4 bulb of 1971. In 1992, US regulations were amended to permit the use of H4 bulbs redesignated HB2 and 9003, and with slightly different production tolerances stipulated. These are physically and electrically interchangeable with H4 bulbs. Similar optical techniques are used, but with different reflector or lens optics to create a US beam pattern rather than a European one.

Each system has its advantages and disadvantages. The American system historically permitted a greater overall amount of light within the low beam, since the entire reflector and lens area is used, but at the same time, the American system has traditionally offered much less control over upward light that causes glare, and for that reason has been largely rejected outside the US. In addition, the American system makes it difficult to create markedly different low and high beam light distributions. The high beam is usually a rough copy of the low beam, shifted slightly upward and leftward. The European system traditionally produced low beams containing less overall light, because only 60% of the reflector&#x27;s surface area is used to create the low beam. However, low beam focus and glare control are easier to achieve. In addition, the lower 40% of the reflector and lens are reserved for high beam formation, which facilitates the optimization of both low and high beams.

====== Developments in the 1990s and 2000s ======
Complex-reflector technology in combination with new bulb designs such as H13 is enabling the creation of European-type low and high beam patterns without the use of a Graves Shield, while the 1992 US approval of the H4 bulb has made traditionally European 60% / 40% optical area divisions for low and high beam common in the US. Therefore, the difference in active optical area and overall beam light content no longer necessarily exists between US and ECE beams. Dual-beam HID headlamps employing reflector technology have been made using adaptations of both techniques.

=== Projector (polyellipsoidal) lamps ===
In this system a filament is located at one focus of an ellipsoidal reflector and has a condenser lens at the front of the lamp. A shade is located at the image plane, between the reflector and lens, and the projection of the top edge of this shade provides the low-beam cutoff. The shape of the shade edge and its exact position in the optical system determine the shape and sharpness of the cutoff. The shade may be lowered by a solenoid actuated pivot to provide a low beam, and removed from the light path for the high beam. Such optics are known as &quot;BiXenon&quot; or &quot;BiHalogen&quot; projectors. If the cutoff shade is fixed in the light path, separate high-beam lamps are required. The condenser lens may have minor Fresnel lens or other surface treatments to reduce cutoff sharpness. Modern condenser lenses incorporate optical features specifically designed to direct some light upward towards the locations of retroreflective overhead road signs.

Hella introduced ellipsoidal optics for acetylene headlamps in 1911, but following the electrification of vehicle lighting, this optical technique wasn&#x27;t used for many decades. The first modern polyellipsoidal (projector) automotive lamp was the &quot;Super-Lite&quot;, an auxiliary headlamp produced in a joint venture between Chrysler Corporation and Sylvania and optionally installed in 1969 and 1970 full-size Dodge automobiles. It used an 85-watt transverse-filament tungsten-halogen bulb and was intended as a mid-beam, to extend the reach of the low beams during turnpike travel when low beams alone were inadequate but high beams would produce excessive glare.

Projector main headlamps appeared in 1981 on the Audi Quartz, a concept car designed by Pininfarina for Geneva Auto Salon. Developed more or less simultaneously in Germany by Hella and Bosch and in France by Cibié, the projector low beam permitted accurate beam focus and a much smaller-diameter optical package, though a much deeper one, for any given beam output. The 1986 BMW 7 Series (E32) was the first volume-production car to use polyellipsoidal low beam headlamps. The main disadvantage of this type of headlamp is the need to accommodate the physical depth of the assembly, which may extend far back into the engine compartment.

== Light sources ==
=== Tungsten ===
The first electric headlamp light source was the tungsten filament, operating in a vacuum or inert-gas atmosphere inside the headlamp bulb or sealed beam. Compared to newer-technology light sources, tungsten filaments give off small amounts of light relative to the power they consume. Also, during the normal operation of such lamps, tungsten boils off the surface of the filament and condenses on the bulb glass, blackening it. This reduces the light output of the filament and blocks some of the light that would pass through an unblackened bulb glass, though blackening was less of a problem in sealed beam units; their large interior surface area minimized the thickness of the tungsten accumulation. For these reasons, plain tungsten filaments are all but obsolete in automotive headlamp service.

=== Tungsten-halogen ===
Tungsten-halogen technology (also called &quot;quartz-halogen&quot;, &quot;quartz-iodine&quot;, &quot;iodine cycle&quot;, etc.) increases the effective luminous efficacy of a tungsten filament: when operating at a higher filament temperature which results in more lumens output per watt input, a tungsten-halogen lamp has a much longer brightness lifetime than similar filaments operating without the halogen regeneration cycle. At equal luminosity, the halogen-cycle bulbs also have longer lifetimes. European-designed halogen headlamp light sources are generally configured to provide more light at the same power consumption as their lower-output plain tungsten counterparts. By contrast, many US-based designs are configured to reduce or minimize the power consumption while keeping light output above the legal minimum requirements; some US tungsten-halogen headlamp light sources produce less initial light than their non-halogen counterparts. A slight theoretical fuel economy benefit and reduced vehicle construction cost through lower wire and switch ratings were the claimed benefits when American industry first chose how to implement tungsten-halogen technology. There was an improvement in seeing distance with US halogen high beams, which were permitted for the first time to produce 150,000 candela (cd) per vehicle, double the non-halogen limit of 75,000 cd but still well shy of the international European limit of 225,000 cd. After replaceable halogen bulbs were permitted in US headlamps in 1983, the development of US bulbs continued to favor long bulb life and low power consumption, while European designs continued to prioritise optical precision and maximum output.

The H1 lamp was the first tungsten-halogen headlamp light source. It was introduced in 1962 by a consortium of European bulb and headlamp makers. This bulb has a single axial filament that consumes 55 watts at 12.0 volts, and produces 1550 lumens ±15% when operated at 13.2 V. H2 (55 W @ 12.0 V, 1820 lm @ 13.2 V) followed in 1964, and the transverse-filament H3 (55 W @ 12.0 V, 1450 lm ±15%) in 1966. H1 still sees wide use in low beams, high beams and auxiliary fog and driving lamps, as does H3. The H2 is no longer a current type, since it requires an intricate bulb holder interface to the lamp, has a short life and is difficult to handle. For those reasons, H2 was withdrawn from ECE Regulation 37 for use in new lamp designs (though H2 bulbs are still manufactured for replacement purposes in existing lamps), but H1 and H3 remain current and these two bulbs were legalised in the United States in 1993. More recent single-filament bulb designs include the H7 (55 W @ 12.0 V, 1500 lm ±10% @ 13.2 V), H8 (35 W @ 12.0 V, 800 lm ±15% @ 13.2 V), H9 (65 W @ 12.0 V, 2100 lm ±10% @ 13.2 V), and H11 (55 W @ 12.0 V, 1350 lm ±10% @ 13.2 V). 24-volt versions of many bulb types are available for use in trucks, buses, and other commercial and military vehicles.
The first dual-filament halogen bulb to produce both a low and a high beam, the H4 (60/55 W @ 12 V, 1650/1000 lm ±15% @ 13.2 V), was released in 1971 and quickly became the predominant headlamp bulb throughout the world except in the United States, where the H4 is still not legal for automotive use. In 1989, the Americans created their own standard for a bulb called HB2: almost identical to H4 except with more stringent constraints on filament geometry and positional variance, and power consumption and light output expressed at the US test voltage of 12.8V.

The first US halogen headlamp bulb, introduced in 1983, was the HB1/9004. It is a 12.8-volt, transverse dual-filament design that produces 700 lumens on low beam and 1200 lumens on high beam. The 9004 is rated for 65 watts (high beam) and 45 watts (low beam) at 12.8 volts. Other US approved halogen bulbs include the HB3 (65 W, 12.8 V), HB4 (55 W, 12.8 V), and HB5 (65/55 watts, 12.8 V). All of the European-designed and internationally approved bulbs except H4 are presently approved for use in headlamps complying with US requirements.

==== Halogen infrared reflective (HIR) ====
A further development of the tungsten-halogen bulb has a dichroic coating that passes visible light and reflects infrared radiation. The glass in such a bulb may be spherical or tubular. The reflected infrared radiation strikes the filament located at the center of the glass envelope, heating the filament to a greater degree than can be achieved through resistive heating alone. The superheated filament emits more light without an increase in power consumption.

=== High-intensity discharge (HID) ===

High-intensity discharge lamps (HID) produce light with an electric arc rather than a glowing filament. The high intensity of the arc comes from metallic salts that are vaporized within the arc chamber. These lamps have a higher efficacy than tungsten lamps. Because of the increased amounts of light available from HID lamps relative to halogen bulbs, HID headlamps producing a given beam pattern can be made smaller than halogen headlamps producing a comparable beam pattern. Alternatively, the larger size can be retained, in which case the HID headlamp can produce a more robust beam pattern.

Automotive HID may be generically called &quot;xenon headlamps&quot;, though they are actually metal-halide lamps that contain xenon gas. The xenon gas allows the lamps to produce minimally adequate light immediately upon start, and shortens the run-up time. The usage of argon, as is commonly done in street lights and other stationary metal-halide lamp applications, causes lamps to take several minutes to reach their full output.

The light from HID headlamps can exhibit a distinct bluish tint when compared with tungsten-filament headlamps.

==== Retrofitment ====
When a halogen headlamp is retrofitted with an HID bulb, light distribution and output are altered. In the United States, vehicle lighting that does not conform to FMVSS 108 is not street legal. Glare will be produced and the headlamp&#x27;s type approval or certification becomes invalid with the altered light distribution, so the headlamp is no longer street-legal in some locales. In the US, suppliers, importers and vendors that offer non-compliant kits are subject to civil fines. By October 2004, the NHTSA had investigated 24 suppliers and all resulted in termination of sale or recalls.

In Europe and the many non-European countries applying ECE Regulations, even HID headlamps designed as such must be equipped with lens cleaning and automatic self-leveling systems, except on motorcycles. These systems are usually absent on vehicles not originally equipped with HID lamps.

==== History ====
In 1992 the first production low beam HID headlamps were manufactured by Hella and Bosch beginning in 1992 for optional availability on the BMW 7 Series. This first system uses a built-in, non-replaceable bulb without a UV-blocking glass shield or touch-sensitive electrical safety cutout, designated D1 – a designation that would be recycled years later for a wholly different type of lamp. The AC ballast is about the size of a building brick.
In 1996 the first American-made effort at HID headlamps was on the 1996–98 Lincoln Mark VIII, which uses reflector headlamps with an unmasked, integral-ignitor lamp made by Sylvania and designated &quot;Type 9500&quot;. This was the only system to operate on DC, since reliability proved inferior to the AC systems. The Type 9500 system was not used on any other models, and was discontinued after Osram&#x27;s takeover of Sylvania in 1997. All HID headlamps worldwide presently use the standardized AC-operated bulbs and ballasts.
In 1999 the first worldwide HID headlights for both low and high beam were introduced on the Mercedes-Benz CL-Class (C215).

==== Operation ====
HID headlamp bulbs do not run on low-voltage DC current, so they require a ballast with either an internal or external &quot;ignitor&quot;. The ignitor is integrated into the bulb in D1 and D3 systems, and is either a separate unit or part of the ballast in D2 and D4 systems. The ballast controls the current to the bulb. The ignition and ballast operation proceeds in three stages:
# Ignition: a high voltage pulse is used to produce an electrical arc – in a manner similar to a spark plug – which ionizes the xenon gas, creating a conducting channel between the tungsten electrodes. Electrical resistance is reduced within the channel, and current flows between the electrodes.
# Initial phase: the bulb is driven with controlled overload. Because the arc is operated at high power, the temperature in the capsule rises quickly. The metallic salts vaporize, and the arc is intensified and made spectrally more complete. The resistance between the electrodes also falls; the electronic ballast control gear registers this and automatically switches to continuous operation.
# Continuous operation: all metal salts are in the vapor phase, the arc has attained its stable shape, and the luminous efficacy has attained its nominal value. The ballast now supplies stable electrical power so the arc will not flicker. Stable operating voltage is 85 volts AC in D1 and D2 systems, 42 volts AC in D3 and D4 systems. The frequency of the square-wave alternating current is typically 400 hertz or higher.

The command is often near the steering wheel and a specific indicator is shown on the dashboard.

==== Bulb types ====
HID headlamps produce between 2,800 and 3,500 lumens from between 35 and 38 watts of electrical power, while halogen filament headlamp bulbs produce between 700 and 2,100 lumens from between 40 and 72 watts at 12.8 V.

Current-production bulb categories are D1S, D1R, D2S, D2R, D3S, D3R, D4S, and D4R. The &quot;D&quot; stands for &quot;discharge&quot;, and the number is the type designator. The final letter describes the outer shield. The arc within an HID headlamp bulb generates considerable short-wave ultraviolet (UV) light, but none of it escapes the bulb, for a UV-absorbing hard glass shield is incorporated around the bulb&#x27;s arc tube. This is important to prevent degradation of UV-sensitive components and materials in headlamps, such as polycarbonate lenses and reflector hardcoats. &quot;S&quot; lamps – D1S, D2S, D3S, and D4S – have a plain glass shield and are primarily used in projector-type optics. &quot;R&quot; lamps – D1R, D2R, D3R, and D4R – are designed for use in reflector-type headlamp optics. They have an opaque mask covering specific portions of the shield, which facilitates the optical creation of the light-dark boundary (cutoff) near the top of a low-beam light distribution. Automotive HID lamps emit considerable near-UV light, despite the shield.

==== Color ====
The correlated color temperature of factory installed automotive HID headlamps is between 4200K while tungsten-halogen lamps are at 3000K to 3550K. The spectral power distribution (SPD) of an automotive HID headlamp is discontinuous and spikey while the SPD of a filament lamp, like that of the sun, is a continuous curve. Moreover, the color rendering index (CRI) of tungsten-halogen headlamps (98) is much closer than that of HID headlamps (~75) to standardized sunlight (100). Studies have shown no significant safety effect of this degree of CRI variation in headlighting.

==== Advantages ====

===== Increased safety =====
Automotive HID lamps offer about 3000 lumens and 90 Mcd/m2 versus 1400 lumens and 30 Mcd/m2 offered by halogen lamps. In a headlamp optic designed for use with an HID lamp, it produces more usable light. Studies have demonstrated drivers react faster and more accurately to roadway obstacles with good HID headlamps compared to halogen ones. Hence, good HID headlamps contribute to driving safety. The contrary argument is that glare from HID headlamps can reduce traffic safety by interfering with other drivers&#x27; vision.

===== Efficacy and output =====
Luminous efficacy is the measure of how much light is produced versus how much energy is consumed. HID lamps give higher efficacy than halogen lamps. The highest-intensity halogen lamps, H9 and HIR1, produce 2100 to 2530 lumens from approximately 70 watts at 13.2 volts. A D2S HID bulb produces 3200 lumens from approximately 42 watts during stable operation. The reduced power consumption means less fuel consumption, with resultant less emission per vehicle fitted with HID lighting (1.3 g/km assuming that 30% of an engine running time is with the lights on).

===== Longevity =====
The average service life of an HID bulb is 2000 hours, compared to between 450 and 1000 hours for a halogen lamp.

==== Disadvantages ====

===== Glare =====
Vehicles equipped with HID headlamps (except motorcycles) are required by ECE regulation 48 also to be equipped with headlamp lens cleaning systems and automatic beam leveling control. Both of these measures are intended to reduce the tendency for high-output headlamps to cause high levels of glare to other road users. In North America, ECE R48 does not apply and while lens cleaners and beam levelers are permitted, they are not required; HID headlamps are markedly less prevalent in the US, where they have produced significant glare complaints. Scientific study of headlamp glare has shown that for any given intensity level, the light from HID headlamps is 40% more glaring than the light from tungsten-halogen headlamps.

===== Mercury content =====
HID headlamp bulb types D1R, D1S, D2R, D2S and 9500 contain the toxic heavy metal mercury. The disposal of mercury-containing vehicle parts is increasingly regulated throughout the world, for example under US EPA regulations. Newer HID bulb designs D3R, D3S, D4R, and D4S which are in production since 2004 contain no mercury, but are not electrically or physically compatible with headlamps designed for previous bulb types.

===== Cost =====
HID headlamps are significantly more costly to produce, install, purchase, and repair. The extra cost of the HID lights may exceed the fuel cost savings through their reduced power consumption, though some of this cost disadvantage is offset by the longer lifespan of the HID bulb relative to halogen bulbs.

=== LED ===


====Timeline====
Audi showed the Audi Nuvolari concept car with LED headlights in 2003. Automotive headlamp applications using light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have been undergoing development since 2004. In 2004, Audi released the first car with LED daytime running lights and directionals, the 2004 Audi A8 W12.

In 2006 the first series-production LED low beams were factory-installed on the Lexus LS 600h / LS 600h L. The high beam and turn signal functions used filament bulbs. The headlamp was supplied by Koito Industries Ltd.

In 2007 the first headlamps with all functions provided by LEDs, supplied by AL-Automotive Lighting, were introduced on the V10 Audi R8 sports car (except in North America).

In 2009 Hella headlamps on the 2009 Cadillac Escalade Platinum became the first all-LED headlamps for the North American market.

In 2010 the first all-LED headlamps with adaptive high beam and what Mercedes called the &quot;Intelligent Light System&quot; were introduced on the 2011 Mercedes CLS.

In 2013 the first digitally controlled full-LED glare-free &quot;Matrix LED&quot; adaptive headlamps were introduced by Audi on the facelifted A8, with 25 individual LED segments. The system dims the light that would shine directly onto oncoming and preceding vehicles, but continues to cast its full light on the zones between and beside them. This works because the LED high beams are split into numerous individual light-emitting diodes. High-beam LEDs in both headlights are arranged in a matrix and adapt fully electronically to the surroundings in milliseconds. They are activated and deactivated or dimmed individually by a control unit. In addition, the headlights also function as a cornering light. Using predictive route data supplied by the MMI navigation plus, the focus of the beam is shifted towards the bend even before the driver turns the steering wheel. In 2014: Mercedes-Benz introduced a similar technology on the facelifted CLS-Class in 2014, called Multibeam LED, with 24 individual segments.

As of 2010, LED headlamps such as those available on the Toyota Prius were providing output between halogen and HID headlamps, with system power consumption slightly lower than other headlamps, longer lifespans, and more flexible design possibilities. As LED technology continues to evolve, the performance of LED headlamps was predicted to improve to approach, meet, and perhaps one day surpass that of HID headlamps. That occurred by mid-2013, when the Mercedes S-Class came with LED headlamps giving higher performance than comparable HID setups.

LED headlamps in recent vehicles have been widely criticized for being too bright and blinding other drivers. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108 has not been updated since the introduction of LEDs, and some manufacturers have reportedly engineered headlamps to have a dark spot where they are measured according to the regulation while being over-illuminated in the rest of the field.

====Cold lenses====
Before LEDs, all light sources used in headlamps (tungsten, halogen, HID) emitted infrared energy that can thaw built-up snow and ice off a headlamp lens and prevent further accumulation; LEDs do not. Some LED headlamps move heat from the heat sink on the back of the LEDs to the inner face of the front lens to warm it up, while on others no provision is made for lens thawing.

===Laser===

A laser lamp uses mirrors to direct a laser on to a phosphor that then emits a light. Laser lamps use half as much power as LED lamps. They were first developed by Audi for use as headlamps in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 2014.

In 2014, the BMW i8 became the first production car to be sold with an auxiliary high-beam lamp based on this technology. The limited-production Audi R8 LMX uses lasers for its spot lamp feature, providing illumination for high-speed driving in low-light conditions. The Rolls-Royce Phantom VIII employs laser headlights with a high beam range of over 600 meters.

== Automatic headlamps ==
Automatic systems for activating the headlamps have been available since the mid-1950s, originally only on luxury American models such as Cadillac&#x27;s Twilight Sentinel, Lincoln, and Imperial. Basic implementations turn the headlights on at dusk and off at dawn. Modern implementations use sensors to detect the amount of exterior light. UN R48 has mandated the installation of automatic headlamps since 30 July 2016. With a daytime running lamp equipped and operated, the dipped beam headlamp should automatically turn on if the car is driving in less than 1,000 lux ambient conditions such as in a tunnel and in dark environments. While in such situations, a daytime running lamp would make glare more evident to the upcoming vehicle driver, which in turn would influence the upcoming vehicle driver&#x27;s eyesight, such that, by automatically switching the daytime running lamp to the dipped-beam headlamp, the inherent safety defect could be solved and safety benefit ensured.

== Beam aim control ==

=== Headlamp leveling systems ===

The 1948 Citroën 2CV was launched in France with a manual headlamp leveling system, controlled by the driver with a knob through a mechanical rod linkage. This allowed the driver to adjust the vertical aim of the headlamps to compensate for the passenger and cargo load in the vehicle. In 1954, Cibié introduced an automatic headlamp leveling system linked to the vehicle&#x27;s suspension system to keep the headlamps correctly aimed regardless of vehicle load, without driver intervention. The first vehicle to be so equipped was the Panhard Dyna Z. Beginning in the 1970s, Germany and some other European countries began requiring remote-control headlamp leveling systems that permit the driver to lower the lamps&#x27; aim by means of a dashboard control lever or knob if the rear of the vehicle is weighted down with passengers or cargo, which would tend to raise the lamps&#x27; aim angle and create glare. Such systems typically use stepper motors at the headlamp and a rotary switch on the dash marked &quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot; for different beam heights, &quot;0&quot; being the &quot;normal&quot; (and highest) position for when the car is lightly loaded.

Internationalized ECE Regulation 48, in force in most of the world outside North America, currently specifies a limited range within which the vertical aim of the headlamps must be maintained under various vehicle load conditions; if the vehicle isn&#x27;t equipped with an adaptive suspension sufficient to keep the headlamps aimed correctly regardless of load, a headlamp leveling system is required. The regulation stipulates a more stringent version of this anti-glare measure if the vehicle has headlamps with low beam light source(s) that produce more than 2,000 lumens – xenon bulbs and certain high-power halogens, for example. Such vehicles must be equipped with headlamp self-leveling systems that sense the vehicle&#x27;s degree of squat due to cargo load and road inclination, and automatically adjust the headlamps&#x27; vertical aim to keep the beam correctly oriented without any action required by the driver.

Leveling systems are not required by the North American regulations. A 2007 study, however, suggests automatic levelers on all headlamps, not just those with high-power light sources, would give drivers substantial safety benefits of better seeing and less glare.

=== Directional headlamps ===

These provide improved lighting for cornering. Some automobiles have their headlamps connected to the steering mechanism so the lights will follow the movement of the front wheels. Czechoslovak Tatra was an early implementer of such a technique, producing in the 1930s a vehicle with a central directional headlamp. The American 1948 Tucker Sedan was likewise equipped with a third central headlamp connected mechanically to the steering system.

The 1967 French Citroën DS and 1970 Citroën SM were equipped with an elaborate dynamic headlamp positioning system that adjusted the inboard headlamps&#x27; horizontal and vertical position in response to inputs from the vehicle&#x27;s steering and suspension systems.

At that time US regulations required this system to be removed from those models sold in the U.S.

The D series cars equipped with the system used cables connecting the long-range headlamps to a lever on the steering relay while the inner long-range headlamps on the SM used a sealed hydraulic system using a glycerin-based fluid instead of mechanical cables. Both these systems were of the same design as their respective cars&#x27; headlamp leveling systems. The cables of the D system tended to rust in the cable sheaths while the SM system gradually leaked fluid, causing the long-range lamps to turn inward, looking &quot;cross-eyed.&quot; A manual adjustment was provided but once it was to the end of its travel the system required refilling with fluid or replacement of the tubes and dashpots.

Citroën SM non-US market vehicles were equipped with heating of the headlamp cover glasses, this heat supplied by ducts carrying warm air from the radiator exhaust to the space between the headlamp lenses and the cover glasses. This provided demisting/defogging of the entire interior of the cover glasses, keeping the glass clear of mist/fog over the entire surface. The glasses have thin stripes on their surfaces that are heated by the headlight beams; however, the ducted warm air provides demisting when the headlamps are not turned on. The glasses&#x27; stripes on both D and SM cars appear similar to rear windshield glass electric defogger heating strips, but they are passive, not electrified.

=== Adaptive front-lighting system (AFS) ===

Beginning in the 2000s, there was a resurgence in interest in the idea of moving or optimizing the headlight beam in response not only to vehicular steering and suspension dynamics, but also to ambient weather and visibility conditions, vehicle speed, and road curvature and contour. A task force under the EUREKA organization, composed primarily of European automakers, lighting companies and regulators began working to develop design and performance specifications for what is known as Adaptive Front-Lighting Systems, commonly &quot;AFS&quot;. Manufacturers such as BMW, Toyota, Škoda, and Vauxhall/Opel have released vehicles equipped with AFS since 2003.

Rather than the mechanical linkages employed in earlier directional-headlamp systems, AFS relies on electronic sensors, transducers, and actuators. Other AFS techniques include special auxiliary optical systems within a vehicle&#x27;s headlamp housings. These auxiliary systems may be switched on and off as the vehicle and operating conditions call for light or darkness at the angles covered by the beam the auxiliary optics produce. A typical system measures steering angle and vehicle speed to swivel the headlamps. The most advanced AFS systems use GPS signals to anticipate changes in road curvature, rather than simply reacting to them.

=== Automatic beam switching ===
Even when conditions would warrant the use of high-beam headlamps, drivers often do not use them. There have long been efforts, particularly in America, to devise an effective automatic beam selection system to relieve the driver of the need to select and activate the correct beam as traffic, weather, and road conditions change. General Motors introduced the first automatic headlight dimmer called the &quot;Autronic Eye&quot; in 1952 on their Cadillac, Buick, and Oldsmobile models; the feature was offered in other GM vehicles starting in 1953. The system&#x27;s phototube and associated circuitry were housed in a gunsight-like tube atop the dashboard. An amplifier module was located in the engine compartment that controlled the headlight relay using signals from the dashboard-mounted tube unit.

This pioneering setup gave way in 1958 to a system called &quot;GuideMatic&quot; in reference to GM&#x27;s &quot;Guide&quot; lighting division. The GuideMatic had a more compact dashtop housing and a control knob that allowed the driver to adjust the system&#x27;s sensitivity threshold to determine when the headlamps would be dipped from high to low beam in response to an oncoming vehicle. By the early 1970s, this option was withdrawn from all GM models except Cadillac, on which GuideMatic was available through 1988. The photosensor for this system used an amber lens, and the adoption of retro-reflective yellow road signs, such as for oncoming curves, caused them to dim prematurely - possibly leading to their discontinuation.

Ford- and Chrysler-built vehicles were also available with the GM-made dimmers from the 1950s through the 1980s. A system called &quot;AutoDim&quot; was offered on several Lincoln models starting in the mid-1950s, and eventually the Ford Thunderbird and some Mercury models offered it as well. Premium Chrysler and Imperial models offered a system called &quot;Automatic Beam Control&quot; throughout the 1960s and early 1970s.

==== Rabinow dimmer ====
Though the systems based on photoresistors evolved, growing more compact and moving from the dashboard to a less conspicuous location behind the radiator grill, they were still unable to reliably distinguish headlamps from non-vehicular light sources such as streetlights. They also did not dip to low beam when the driver approached a vehicle from behind, and they would spuriously dip to low beam in response to road sign reflections of the vehicle&#x27;s own high beam headlamps. American inventor Jacob Rabinow devised and refined a scanning automatic dimmer system impervious to streetlights and reflections, but no automaker purchased the rights, and the problematic photoresistor type remained on the market through the late 1980s.

==== Bone-Midland lamps ====
In 1956, the inventor Even P. Bone developed a system where a vane in front of each headlight moved automatically and caused a shadow in front of the approaching vehicle, allowing for high beam use without glare for the approaching driver. The system, called &quot;Bone-Midland Lamps,&quot; was never taken up by any car manufacturer.

==== Camera-based dimmer ====

Present systems based on imaging CMOS cameras can detect and respond appropriately to leading and oncoming vehicles while disregarding streetlights, road signs, and other spurious signals. Camera-based beam selection was first released in 2005 on the Jeep Grand Cherokee and has since then been incorporated into comprehensive driver assistance systems by automakers worldwide. The headlights will dim when a bright reflection bounces off of a street sign.

=== Intelligent Light System ===

&quot;Intelligent Light System&quot; is a headlamp beam control system introduced in 2006 on the Mercedes-Benz E-Class (W211) which offers five different bi-xenon light functions, each of which is suited to typical driving or weather conditions:
* Country mode
* Motorway mode
* Enhanced fog lamps
* Active light function (Advanced front-lighting system (AFS))
* Cornering light function

=== Adaptive highbeam ===
&quot;Adaptive Highbeam Assist&quot; is Mercedes-Benz&#x27;s marketing name for a headlight control strategy that continuously automatically tailors the headlamp range so the beam just reaches other vehicles ahead, thus always ensuring maximum possible seeing range without glaring other road users. It was first launched in the Mercedes E-class in 2009. It provides a continuous range of beam reach from a low-aimed low beam to a high-aimed high beam, rather than the traditional binary choice between low and high beams.

The range of the beam can vary between 65 and 300 meters, depending on traffic conditions. In traffic, the low beam cutoff position is adjusted vertically to maximise seeing range while keeping glare out of leading and oncoming drivers&#x27; eyes. When no traffic is close enough for glare to be a problem, the system provides full high beam. Headlamps are adjusted every 40 milliseconds by a camera on the inside of the front windscreen which can determine distance to other vehicles. The S-Class, CLS-Class and C-Class also offer this technology. In the CLS, the adaptive high beam is realised with LED headlamps - the first vehicle producing all adaptive light functions with LEDs. 

This technology is also known as &quot;Adaptive Driving Beams&quot; (ADB). Since 2010 some Audi models with Xenon headlamps are offering a similar system: &quot;adaptive light&quot; with variable headlight range control. In Japan, the Toyota Crown, Toyota Crown Majesta, Nissan Fuga and Nissan Cima offer the technology on top level models.

Until February 2022, this technology had been illegal in the US, as FMVSS 108 specifically stated that headlamps must have dedicated high and low beams to be deemed road-legal. An infrastructure bill enacted in November 2021 included language that directs the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to amend FMVSS 108 to allow the use of this technology, and set a two-year deadline for implementing this change. In February 2022, the NHTSA amended FMVSS 108 allowing adaptive headlights for use in the US. However, the new regulations are quite different from the ones in effect in Europe and Asia and prevent car manufacturers from easily adapting their systems to the US market.

=== Glare-free high beam and pixel light ===

A &quot;glare-free high beam&quot; is a camera-driven dynamic lighting control strategy that selectively shades spots and slices out of the high beam pattern to protect other road users from glare, while continuously providing the driver with maximum seeing range. The area surrounding other road users is constantly illuminated at high beam intensity, but without the glare that would typically result from using uncontrolled high beams in traffic. This constantly changing beam pattern requires complex sensors, microprocessors, and actuators because the vehicles which must be shadowed out of the beam are constantly moving. The dynamic shadowing can be achieved with movable shadow masks shifted within the light path inside the headlamp. Or, the effect can be achieved by selectively darkening addressable LED emitters or reflector/mirror elements, a technique known as &quot;pixel light&quot;.

The first mechanically controlled (non-LED), glare-free high beam was Volkswagen&#x27;s &quot;Dynamic Light Assist&quot; package, which was introduced in 2010 on the Volkswagen Touareg, Phaeton, and Passat. In 2012, the facelifted Lexus LS (XF40) introduced an identical bi-xenon system: &quot;Adaptive High-beam System&quot;.

The first mechanically controlled LED glare-free headlamps were introduced in 2012 on BMW 7 Series: &quot;Selective Beam&quot; (anti-dazzle high-beam assistant). In 2013 Mercedes-Benz introduced the same LED system: &quot;Adaptive Highbeam Assist Plus&quot;.

The first digitally controlled LED glare-free headlamps were introduced in 2013 on Audi A8. See LED section.

== Care ==
Headlamp systems require periodic maintenance. Sealed beam headlamps are modular; when the filament burns out, the entire sealed beam is replaced. Most vehicles in North America made since the late 1980s use headlamp lens-reflector assemblies that are considered a part of the car, and just the bulb is replaced when it fails. Manufacturers vary the means by which the bulb is accessed and replaced. Headlamp aim must be properly checked and adjusted frequently, for misaimed lamps are dangerous and ineffective.

Over time, the headlamp lens can deteriorate. It can become pitted due to abrasion of road sand and pebbles and can crack, admitting water into the headlamp. &quot;Plastic&quot; (polycarbonate) lenses can become cloudy and discoloured. This is due to oxidation of the painted-on lens hardcoat by ultraviolet light from the sun and the headlamp bulbs. If it is minor, it can be polished out using a reputable brand of a car polish that is intended for restoring the shine to chalked paint. In more advanced stages, the deterioration extends through the actual plastic material, rendering the headlamp useless and necessitating complete replacement. Sanding or aggressively polishing the lenses, or plastic headlight restoration, can buy some time, but doing so removes the protective coating from the lens, which when so stripped will deteriorate faster and more severely. Kits for a quality repair are available that allow the lens to be polished with progressively finer abrasives, and then be sprayed with an aerosol of ultra violet resistant clear coating.

The reflector, made out of vaporized aluminum deposited in an extremely thin layer on a metal, glass, or plastic substrate, can become dirty, oxidised, or burnt, and lose its specularity. This can happen if water enters the headlamp, if bulbs of higher than specified wattage are installed, or simply with age and use. Reflectors thus degraded, if they cannot be cleaned, must be replaced.

== Lens cleaners ==

Dirt buildup on headlamp lenses increases glare to other road users, even at levels too low to reduce seeing performance significantly for the driver. Therefore, headlamp lens cleaners are required by UN Regulation 48 on vehicles equipped with low-beam headlamps using light sources that have a reference luminous flux of 2,000 lumens or more. This includes all HID headlamps and some high-power halogen units. Some cars have lens cleaners fitted even where the regulations do not require them. North America, for example, does not use UN regulations, and FMVSS 108 does not require lens cleaners on any headlamps, though they are permitted.

Lens cleaning systems come in two main varieties: a small motor-driven rubber wiper or brush conceptually similar to windshield wipers, or a fixed or telescopic high-pressure sprayer which cleans the lenses with a spray of windshield washer fluid. Most recent lens cleaning systems are of the spray type because UN regulations do not permit mechanical cleaning systems (wipers) to be used with plastic-lens headlamps, and most recent headlamps have plastic lenses. Some cars with retractable headlamps, such as the original Mazda MX-5, have a squeegee at the front of the lamp recess which automatically wipes the lenses as they are raised or lowered, although it does not provide washer fluid.

==Covers==
Headlamp covers are aftermarket modifications made from a variety of materials (e.g., metal, polycarbonate, ABS plastic or self-adhesive vinyl film) which are applied over the headlamps of a car in order to reduce the percentage of light transmitted, to tint the color of the light transmitted, and/or to protect the lenses from stone chips, bug splatters, and minor abrasions.

During World War II, civil and military authorities often enforced brownouts and blackouts, restricting the use of lights on passenger vehicles in order to hinder detection by aerial reconnaissance and bombers. Blackouts (turning off lights) and brownouts (limiting light emissions by way of hoods and masks) were enforced in cities and coastal areas as protection against the night-time aerial attacks in both Axis and Allied countries. One of the first civilian examples of headlight covers was produced in NSW, Australia by the Read family dairy.

The use of headlight covers and the modification of light produced by vehicles continued in both the military&#x27;s development of special blackout head and tail light technologies and in the civilian sector as well. In addition to headlight covers&#x27; use in light reduction, they have also been employed to protect headlamps from damage in both civilian and combat environments.

===Legality===
There is no statute which governs the use of headlight covers throughout the United States. Most localities and municipalities will have laws which regulate the use of headlight covers and or tint and will specify the percentage of light that must pass through and/or the minimum distance from which a vehicle&#x27;s headlights must be visible.

<text>The Evangelical Free Church of America (EFCA) is an evangelical Christian denomination in the Radical Pietistic tradition. The EFCA was formed in 1950 from the merger of the Swedish Evangelical Free Church and the Norwegian-Danish Evangelical Free Church Association. It is affiliated with the International Federation of Free Evangelical Churches.

==History==
The Swedish Evangelical Free Church formed from a number of Free Mission Friends as the Swedish Evangelical Free Mission in Boone, Iowa, in October 1884. Several churches that had been members of the Swedish Evangelical Lutheran Ansgar Synod and the Swedish Evangelical Lutheran Mission Synod, along with some independent congregations, were instrumental in organizing this voluntary fellowship. In the same year, two Norwegian-Danish groups in Boston, Massachusetts, and Tacoma, Washington, began to fellowship together. By 1912, they had formed the Norwegian-Danish Evangelical Free Church Association. The Swedish and Norwegian-Danish bodies united in June 1950 at a merger conference held at the Medicine Lake Conference Grounds near Minneapolis, Minnesota. The two bodies represented 275 local congregations at the time of the merger.

The EFCA shares some early ties with those who formed the Swedish Evangelical Covenant Church as they both came from Mission Friends groups. It has been a member of the National Association of Evangelicals since 1943, the year after that organization was formed.

==Beliefs==
In its Statement of Faith, the Evangelical Free Church of America affirms the authority and inerrancy of the Bible; the Trinity; atonement through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ; original sin; Christ as head of the church and the local church&#x27;s right to self government; the personal and imminent return of Christ; the bodily resurrection of the dead; and the two ordinances of water baptism and the Lord&#x27;s Supper. The denomination, within its own Statement of Faith and FAQ, claims to be most similar to the Baptist tradition, but prefers to use &quot;baptist&quot; with a lowercase &quot;b&quot; as a minor non-primary descriptor due to it primarily although not exclusively embracing the Baptist doctrine on credobaptism, while leaving some allowances for the use of paedobaptism because of its early history having origins within Lutheranism, and having had an influx of former Methodists and Presbyterians in the denomination&#x27;s early days.

The EFCA passed a substantial revision to its Statement of Faith on June 26, 2008, the first revision since the Statement was first adopted in 1950. This revision was proposed in order &quot;to update archaic language, to clarify some theological ambiguities, to seek greater theological precision, to address new issues, to have a SoF that would be better suited to be used as a teaching tool in our churches.&quot; Specific beliefs based on biblical interpretation can vary somewhat due to the congregational governance system that gives autonomy to individual local EFCA churches.

The EFCA does not ordain women. The church describes its stance on homosexuality and same-sex marriage as &quot;welcoming but not affirming,&quot; stating that the church &quot;will not credential one who engages in homosexual conduct or one who does not believe that homosexual behavior is sinful, even though remaining celibate.&quot;

==Structure==

The word &quot;Free&quot; in the Evangelical Free Church&#x27;s name refers to its congregational polity, meaning each member church is autonomous, and to its history, meaning that the free churches were free from state control. The governing body of the EFCA is the Leadership Conference held annually. Delegates to the conference are credentialed ministers, chaplains, tenured university faculty, and representatives of each EFCA church. The Leadership Conference elects the board of directors which acts as the governing body between Leadership Conference meetings. As chair of the Directional Team, the President coordinates the work of the various national boards and ministries. The office of the President has responsibility for reviewing the licensing and ordaining of ministers and, in addition, oversees the discipline and restoration process for pastors.

The EFCA is divided into 17 regional districts which, among other responsibilities, examines and approves applicants for ordination. The denomination maintains headquarters in suburban Minneapolis, Minnesota, and engages in ministries in education, publications, senior housing, children&#x27;s homes, and camp facilities. The EFCA supports the mission of Trinity International University and Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Deerfield, Illinois; Trinity Law School in Santa Ana, California; and supports Trinity Western University in Langley, British Columbia, Canada.

The Evangelical Free Church is a member of the International Federation of Free Evangelical Churches.

==Membership trends==
In 1950 there were 20,000 members and under 300 congregations. By the 1980s there were over 800 congregations and over 100,000 members. In 2003, the Association reported 300,000 members in over 1,400 congregations. In 2014, the EFCA reported a weekly attendance of 371,191 in 1,500 congregations. In the United States there are 1,314 EFCA churches and 176 church plants with 270 multi-ethnic churches and 102 multi-site or second language services. Close to 550 missionaries serve in more than 80 countries. As of 2000, California had the largest number of congregations with 175. However, membership is primarily concentrated in the Midwest.

<doc id="418783" wikidata="Q7414058" url="?curid=418783" title="San Francisco LGBT Community Center">
<text>The San Francisco LGBT Community Center, also known as the SF LGBT Center, is a nonprofit organization serving the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer community of San Francisco, California, and nearby communities, located at 1800 Market Street in San Francisco. The mission of the SF LGBT Center is &quot;to connect the diverse LGBTQ+ community to opportunities, resources, and each other to achieve a stronger, healthier, and more equitable world for LGBTQ+ people and our allies.&quot; 

The center is housed within the designated landmark the Fallon Building, as well as having a newer portion of architecture.

==Programs and services==
The Center&#x27;s programs and services include:
*Economic Development (including housing and financial services, employment services, and small business services)
*Youth Services (including drop-in navigation, mental health services, and housing programs)
*Community Programs (including information and referral program, arts and culture program, and volunteer program)
*Building Services (including event rental space, computer lab, and partner organization tenants)

==Operations==

The agency&#x27;s annual budget is approximately $4.5 million, supported by a combination of San Francisco city government grants, rental and event income, and institutional and individual donations. The Center&#x27;s Executive Director Rebecca Rolfe leads a staff of about 30 staff members.

==Building==
The center&#x27;s building was created in two parts, and includes the Fallon Building (or Carmel Fallon) includes a Victorian Queen Anne home and commercial building, built in 1894 by Carmelita Lodge Fallon (1827–1923); as well as a modern portion of the building facing Market Street. 

Incorporated in 1996, the Center opened its solar-powered, facility in March 2002. In 2016, the Center began a $6.5 million renovation project to expand the space available to nonprofits that lease space in the building, as well as to improve circulation in the lobby. Programs continued throughout the renovation. On April 9, 2017, the Center held a ribbon cutting ceremony and celebration to mark completion of the renovation and the 15th anniversary of the Center. The total cost of the renovation was $10 million.

<text>Cloelia () was a legendary woman from the early history of ancient Rome.

==Biography==
She was one of the women taken hostage by Lars Porsena as a part of the peace treaty which ended the war between Rome and Clusium in 508 BC. Ancient historians present two different stories explaining her escape. The first version of Cloelia&#x27;s escape recognizes that the female hostages went to the river to bathe. Having persuaded their guards to leave them alone at the river, in order to remain modest, they swam across the river into Roman territory. The second version claims that Cloelia escaped from the Etruscan camp, leading away a group of Roman virgins. According to Valerius Maximus, she fled upon a horse, and swam across the river Tiber through a barrage of hostile darts, thus bringing her band of girls to safety.

When Porsena learnt of their escape, he quickly sent emissaries to Rome demanding her return. However, Porsena soon reconsidered, deciding that her deeds were worthy of admiration equal to that of Horatius Cocles and Gaius Mucius Scaevola. He declared to the Romans that if she were restored to him he would send her back to Rome safe and inviolate, but if his demands were not met he should regard the treaty as broken.

The Romans agreed to the conditions and returned the pledge of peace, as the treaty required. Porsena praised Cloelia on her arrival and, as a reward for her heroism, promised to release half the share of his hostages of her choice. It is said that she selected the young boys, as was unanimously decided by the hostages, since they were particularly at risk of abuse.

Once peace had been established, the Romans celebrated her valour by building a statue of a maiden seated on a horse, set up on the summit of the Via Sacra.

==Cultural depictions==

Cloelia has been depicted in several paintings and in the libretto &quot;Il trionfo di Clelia&quot; (1762) by Pietro Metastasio.
She was also portrayed by Sylvia Syms in the 1961 Italian movie &quot;Le Vergini di Roma&quot;.

<text>The New Progressive Party (, PNP) is a political party in Puerto Rico that advocates for statehood. The PNP is one of the two major parties in Puerto Rico with significant political strength and currently holds the seat of the governor and a majority in both legislative houses.

The party is primarily contrasted by two other political parties: the Popular Democratic Party (PPD), which advocates maintaining the current political status of Puerto Rico as that of an unincorporated territory of the United States with self-government, and the smaller Puerto Rican Independence Party (PIP), which advocates for the independence of Puerto Rico.

In national/mainland politics, members are split, with some party members affiliating with the Republican Party and some with the Democratic Party, although the PNP tends to be seen as slightly more conservative than the PPD overall.

The party traces its history back to 1967. In that year, the Partido Estadista Republicano instructed its members to not participate in a referendum on statehood held that year. Unhappy with the mandate, several dissidents left the Statehood Party and founded the PNP afterwards.

==History==

===Foundation===
The party traces its beginnings to an August, 1967 assembly in a sports complex (which is now known as el Estadio Country Club) in the sector of Country Club, San Juan, Puerto Rico. On January 5, 1968, the party was belatedly certified as an official political group by the State Elections Commission of Puerto Rico. The party had roots in a prior pro-statehood party led by Miguel Angel García Méndez. The incipient party campaigned unsuccessfully in favor of statehood in the Puerto Rico status referendum of 1967, even though the historical pro-statehood Puerto Rican Republican Party decided to boycott that plebiscite. Main party founder, president, and former statehood Republican Party standard-bearer Luis A. Ferré categorized the New Progressive Party as one which would not be aligned to any of the two major U.S. national parties.

Under Luis A. Ferré, the NPP came to power in January 1969, after defeating Luis Negrón López, the gubernatorial candidate from the Popular Democratic Party (PDP) in the November 1968 elections. Smaller vote totals were obtained by the Partido del Pueblo led by Governor Roberto Sánchez Vilella and the candidate from the Puerto Rican Independence Party (PIP), Antonio González. The governing party was saddled by Sánchez Vilella&#x27;s break-away candidacy, who had feuded with the PPD founder and former Governor Luis Muñoz Marín.

===1970s===

Four years later, in 1972, Ferré lost to the reunified PDP&#x27;s candidate, Senate President Rafael Hernández Colón, by the biggest percentual margin since the NPP&#x27;s founding (7.3%); however, in 1976, under the leadership of San Juan Mayor Carlos Romero Barceló, the NPP returned to power. Romero Barceló would face Hernández Colón three times for the governorship.

===1980s===
In the 1980 general elections, Carlos A. Romero Barceló won reelection by a narrow margin of approximately 3,000 votes. A prominent event during Romero Barceló&#x27;s term, the Cerro Maravilla incident, would end up overshadowing Romero Barceló&#x27;s governorship. The incident involved the killing of two young men who had gone to Cerro Maravilla, site of a major communications facility for the island, with the intention of sabotaging the facilities. After arriving at Cerro Maravilla the two men were ambushed and killed by the state police. Initially, it was reported that the two young men had been shot because they resisted arrest; as the investigation progressed, however, it became clear the men had been shot, execution style, while under police custody. The opposition party, the PDP (which was in control of the legislature at the time), organized hearings in which they attempted to prove the whole incident was planned by the administration of Gov. Romero Barceló. Further scandals erupted when it became known that an undercover police agent who was with the two men had actually engineered the whole plan. This, combined with the fact that the then-mayor of San Juan, Hernán Padilla, left the party to form his own party (Partido Renovación Puertorriqueña, PRP), helped Hernández Colón get elected to a second non-consecutive term in 1984. In 1988, San Juan Mayor and former Resident Commissioner Baltasar Corrada del Río ran as the NPP candidate for governor but lost the race to Hernández Colón, who won a third term.

===1990s===
The NPP came back to power in 1993 when Pedro Rosselló, a pediatric surgeon who had been its unsuccessful congressional candidate in 1988, became governor by defeating Luis Muñoz Marín&#x27;s daughter, Senator Victoria Muñoz Mendoza, the PDP candidate for governor.

Rosselló launched an anti-crime campaign known as &quot;Mano dura contra el crimen&quot; (&quot;Strong hand against crime&quot;) in which the Puerto Rico National Guard was used to assist the Island police force. During Pedro J. Rosselló&#x27;s term, a number of large-scale infrastructure projects were undertaken, including the &quot;Tren Urbano&quot; (Metro Rail System), the &quot;Superaqueduct&quot;, the construction of the Puerto Rico Convention Center and the Puerto Rico Coliseum. His policies also included a push toward privatization of public entities and free health care for the poor.

He led the NPP in a campaign for Puerto Rican statehood in 1993, in which locally enacted plebiscites were held to consult the Puerto Rican public on their position regarding the political status of the island with the United States. He supported the proposal for a referendum in Puerto Rico to define the political status of the island. However, the bill died in committee in the U.S. Senate. Nevertheless, Rosselló carried out another plebiscite in 1998 which gave electors four options plus a fifth one, &quot;None of the Above&quot;. The opposing Popular Democratic Party led a campaign to boycott the plebiscite, charging it was structured to favor the ruling NPP party&#x27;s statehood goals, and called the electorate to vote for the &quot;None of the Above&quot; option. The boycott was successful, as the None of the Above column garnered more votes than all of the other options. Rosselló, however, argued before Congress that statehood had obtained more votes than any of the other political status options in the plebiscite as he claimed that the fifth option (&quot;None of the Above&quot;) was an undefined vote in terms of status.

In the 1996 elections, the NPP candidate, Rosselló, defeated opponent Héctor Luis Acevedo (PDP), the mayor of San Juan at the time, and Representative David Noriega (PIP), for a second term, after obtaining more than one million votes and the largest landslide of any gubernatorial candidate since 1964.

In 1998, the sale of the state-owned Puerto Rico Telephone Company (PRTC) to GTE for $1.9 billion led to a general strike organized by labor unions and backed by opposition forces. Rosselló&#x27;s popularity along with the NPP&#x27;s took a hit due to the backlash, as well as to several major corruption cases.

===2000s===
Rosselló stepped down as governor after eight years in power in 2001. His period as governor was marked by the Vieques protests and major economic growth due to the coincidence of the emerging Internet. In 2000, Carlos I. Pesquera, Secretary of Transportation under Rosselló, ran for governor. Pre-election polls had him at a considerable advantage over his PDP opponent, San Juan mayor Sila María Calderón. As the election grew closer, Calderón closed the gap as Pesquera&#x27;s image was harmed by a PDP campaign focusing on corruption under Rosselló&#x27;s tenure.

It also did not help Pesquera that the Acting US District Attorney Guillermo Gil said in June 2000 (three months before the November 2000 election) &quot;corruption has a name and it is called the New Progressive Party&quot; while announcing a grand jury indictment. The grand jury had accused 18 people — including two mayors from Rosselló&#x27;s NPP — of running an extortion scheme that skimmed $800,000 in kickbacks from a $56 million government contract. During a news conference, Gil told journalists that the extorted money had ended up in the coffers of the NPP. This and other actions by Gil were object of many ethics complaints to the US Department of Justice by NPP leaders.

In this environment, the NPP lost the 2000 election, losing the Governor&#x27;s seat, the Resident Commissioner, and the state legislature. This was the first election since its creation that the NPP suffered a vote reduction. Leo Díaz assumed the NPP Presidency, but it was short-lived as Pesquera returned to occupy the position after defeating Díaz.

Turmoil consumed the NPP during the first two years of the 2001–2005 term. The Secretary of Education, under the Rossello&#x27;s administration, Víctor Fajardo, was charged and convicted by federal agencies of appropriating millions of federal funds directed to the Education Department. The former House Speaker and Republican National Committee Man, Edison Misla Aldarondo was also charged with extortion by the US Attorney&#x27;s Office, and was forced to resign. In an ironic turn of events, NPP figures charged with federal corruption crimes were also charged with corruption by the Puerto Rico Justice Department using new anti-corruption state laws that the NPP had enacted. In 2001, Calderon named a &quot;Blue Ribbon&quot; Committee that was dedicated to investigate government transactions under Rossello&#x27;s two terms.

====2003 NPP primaries for Governor====
In July 2002, several of the party&#x27;s leaders were involved in an incident at the Office of Women&#x27;s Affairs. Pesquera led a group of pro-statehood advocates and the press into the government office whose administrator had refused to display the American flag alongside the flag of Puerto Rico, as required by law. A jury acquitted Pesquera and other followers of any wrongdoing.

In March 2003, Rosselló, who had been living in the Commonwealth of Virginia, returned to the island, responding to the many calls and visits he received from prominent citizens and politicians. Rosselló subsequently defeated Pesquera in the NPP primary for the gubernatorial nomination.

====2004 General Elections====

Rosselló&#x27;s prior administration was repeatedly painted as corrupt, while his PDP opponent (Calderón chose not to run for re-election), Resident Commissioner Aníbal Acevedo Vilá (PDP) was initially behind in the polls. After his performance in televised debates, Acevedo&#x27;s campaign gained momentum, aided in part by the favorable press he received from the island media outlets. In pre-election polls, Rosselló led by double digits, but ultimately Rosselló lost by some 3,000 votes (1,200 votes went as write-in for Carlos Pesquera) proving that once again that corruption matters to Puerto Rican voters. Rosselló challenged the electoral results alleging that split ticket votes, which had always been counted before, were now illegal. After a lengthy court battle decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, Acevedo Vila was certified as governor.

====Senate conflict====
As 2005 began, Rosselló became a Senator for the Arecibo district after Senator Víctor Loubriel resigned from the seat to which he&#x27;d been elected, effectively gaining a seat for which he did not run. Thus started a struggle between Senate President Kenneth McClintock and Rosselló for control of the Senate Presidency. The dispute ended in a stalemate as McClintock refused to leave the position, a stance respected by the PDP minority senators and five other NPP senators. This led to the expulsion from the party of McClintock as well as two of the NPP senators who backed him, a matter which led McClintock to file suit in San Juan Superior Court, winning the case, which was confirmed by the Puerto Rico Supreme Court in a 5–1 ruling. The infighting ended when Rosselló was defeated in the 2008 primary and when McClintock co-chaired Sen. Hillary Clinton&#x27;s successful Democratic primary campaign and helped lead her to a record-setting 68–32% victory in the waning days of her bid for the Democratic nomination.

====2008 NPP primaries for Governor====
On March 7, 2007, Rosselló stated that he was no longer interested in the Senate Presidency and then focused his attention in preventing Resident Commissioner Luis Fortuño from winning the March 2008 gubernatorial primary, and allowed his name to be placed in nomination for the party&#x27;s gubernatorial primary. McClintock and four other senators won in San Juan Superior Court a suit to nullify the sanctions and expulsions that the party leadership has levied against them. The Puerto Rico Supreme Court confirmed the lower court decision by a 5-to-1 vote. As a result, McClintock and his supporters were recognized as NPP members and free to run under the party banner. Shortly after the primary polls closed on March 9, 2008, Pedro Rosselló conceded the victory to Luis Fortuño after a large margin of votes in favor of his opponent in the NPP party primaries for the presidency of the party and gubernatorial nomination. Rosselló &quot;admitted&quot; defeat even before the votes were completely tallied claiming Fortuño as the next candidate of the PNP party. On March 10, 2008, Rosselló sent the media a written statement regarding his future in which he confirmed he will be retiring from active politics and will not be campaigning for any candidate, however he would finish his term as senator for the Arecibo District, which he did.

===== Primary backlash =====

Most of Rosselló&#x27;s supporters were elected in the primary and endorsed Fortuño as their candidate for governor. However, several prominent NPP members demonstrated strong opposition to Fortuño&#x27;s candidacy and victory.

Ramírez was a candidate for Resident Commissioner in the primaries and was openly supporting Rosselló. She lost to Fortuño&#x27;s candidate, Pedro Pierluisi, and to another Rosselló supporter who was also defeated, former Senate President, Charlie Rodríguez. When Ramírez was asked by the media if she will vote for Fortuño, she replied &quot;My vote is secret&quot;.

Another strong voice against Fortuño was NPP former President Leo Díaz. Díaz accused Fortuño and his wife of having ties to PDP law firms and to colonialist interests. At a November 4, 2007, rally called &quot;Con Fuerza para Vencer&quot; (With the Strength to Win), Díaz said, &quot;In this primary the life of this party is in jeopardy. The other candidate, Fortuño, isn&#x27;t a real statehood defender! He should explain why he has ties with PDP&#x27;s law firms and why the colonialist special interests are financing his campaign[...]&quot;. He has since rejoined party activities and chairs Santini&#x27;s 2012 reelection efforts.

San Juan mayor Jorge Santini also made strong statements against Fortuño during the primary campaign, as he supported Rosselló. He said that Fortuño wasn&#x27;t a &quot;full-time leader&quot; and that he &quot;made arrangements with other causes&quot;. He subsequently campaigned for Fortuño, both in 2008 as well as 2012.

====2008 elections====
On November 4, 2008, the NPP retained and expanded super-majorities in the Legislative Assembly, and won both the Resident Commissioner and Governor race by a landslide.

=== 2010s ===

====2012 election and plebiscite====
While Gov. Fortuño failed to win reelection on Nov. 6, 2012, his running mate Pedro R. Pierluisi Urrutia became Puerto Rico&#x27;s top vote-getter. In a separate matter, in 2012, the NPP won by wide margins the two questions posed in a separate political status plebiscite ballot. Fifty-four percent rejected the continuation of the current territorial political relationship with the United States while 61% of those choosing another political status voted for statehood.

====2016 election====
On November 8, 2016, the NPP&#x27;s gubernatorial candidate Ricardo Rosselló beat the PDP&#x27;s candidate, former Secretary of State David Bernier, to become the Governor of Puerto Rico. In the same election, Jenniffer González became the new, and first female, Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico. The New Progressive Party became the majority in the Legislative Assembly by winning 21 seats of the Senate and 34 seats of the House of Representatives. However, the PDP retained a majority of the mayoralty races in the island, with a total of 45 out of 78 municipalities. The New Progressive Party (PNP) won a total of 33.

=== 2020s ===

====2020 election====
On September 24, 2020, Jorge Báez Pagán became the first openly gay member of the House of Representatives in the island&#x27;s history. In January 2021, the new delegation of 21 PNP elected officials pledged to not increase taxes citing an unemployment rate of 14% in Puerto Rico. Instead governor Pierluisi opted for cuts in pensions to balance the budget, which was received with protests from 18 unions in Puerto Rico. The protestors rather favoured Bill 120, proposed by PNP representative Lourdes Ramos, to guarantee a &quot;dignified retirement&quot;.

====2024 election====
In the 2024 Puerto Rico gubernatorial election, the party&#x27;s candidate Jenniffer González-Colón was elected Governor. The party campaigned for statehood in the 2024 Puerto Rican status referendum.

==Electoral history==
===In legislative elections===


===Gubernatorial Elections===


===Resident Commissioner Elections===


==Affiliation with national parties==

Three NPP gubernatorial candidates registered nationally as Republicans (Luis A. Ferré, Baltasar Corrada and Luis G. Fortuño) while five NPP gubernatorial candidates registered nationally as Democrats (Carlos Romero Barceló, Carlos Pesquera, Pedro Pierluisi, Pedro Rosselló and Ricardo Rosselló). When Fortuño was governor, his top administration officials were also split in national politics. His last chief of staff, Miguel Romero, and his Secretary of State (and first in line of succession), Kenneth McClintock, are Democrats, while his last Attorney General, Guillermo Somoza, is a Republican. House NPP Leader Johnny Méndez and Senate Majority Leader Tomas Rivera Schatz are Republicans. The current Resident Commissioner is Republican Jenniffer González-Colón.

==Party logo==

The party is strongly associated with the color blue in Puerto Rico because of its logo. Since the logo features a palm tree, many Puerto Ricans call the NPP &quot;La Palma&quot;. The use of the coconut palm tree as a symbol by the PNP persists to this day.

The logo&#x27;s original version consisted of a light blue palm tree, partially encircled by words in a semicircle (the exact color hue for the logo being that of the United Nations flag, as a result of a personal request from party founder Luis A. Ferré). The original logo had the party&#x27;s name surrounding it; eventually, the words &quot;estadidad, seguridad, progreso&quot; (&quot;statehood, security, progress&quot; in English) substituted the party name. The logo later enclosed the palm tree in a blue oval and reversed its colors. The tonality of blue used in the newer logo was eventually changed to a deep navy blue, as to liken it to that of the canton of the United States&#x27; flag.

In 2014, the party approved the new logo, which now includes the word &quot;Igualdad&quot; (equality).

<text>Sandymount () is a coastal suburb in the Dublin 4 district on the Southside of Dublin in Ireland.

==Etymology==

An early name for the area was Scal&#x27;d Hill or Scald Hill. During the 18th century, there was a village called Brickfield Town on the site of Sandymount Green; this took its name from Lord Merrion&#x27;s brickfields, which stretched from here to Merrion at the time. The Irish name &quot;Dumhach Thrá&quot; is more recent than the one in English and approximately translates as sandy ground or sand dune of a beach.

==Geography==
Sandymount is located between 3 and 4 km south-east of Dublin&#x27;s city centre. At the northern end, it begins where Newbridge Avenue meets Herbert Road, running to Church Avenue at the coast, west along the DART rail line, and south to Merrion Gates. Sandymount Promenade runs along the coast road (Strand Road) from Sandymount Strand, down to Merrion Gates. It lies a little south of the Great South Wall in Dublin Bay.

The River Dodder passes nearby to the west, and three streams, the Elm Park, Nutley and Trimleston, come to the coast to the south, but any pollution of these affects Sandymount Strand. In the past, the Nutley Stream came to the coast in what is now Sandymount and severe flooding occurred on the old course in 1963.

Neighbouring suburbs are Ballsbridge, Merrion, and Irishtown.

=== Transport ===
The area is served by the (DART) commuter rail system and two stops are located in the area, Sandymount and Sydney Parade. It is served by bus routes C1 and C2, S2 and 47. It was once served by the routes 2, 3, which ceased operation and were replaced with routes 1 on 12 May 2012 and 52 which ceased operation in 1998. The 2 and 3 routes were brought in as replacements for the Dublin tramways routes of the same numbers, which were closed on 26 March 1940. The 4 also ran to Sandymount until 1932.

Both railway stations on the electrified (DART) suburban railway system were originally opened in January 1835 by the Dublin and Kingstown Railway and continue to this day.

==Amenities==
=== Baths ===
The &quot;Merrion Promenade Pier and Baths Co.&quot; built Sandymount swimming baths in 1883. The baths measured approximately 40 by 40 metres, with a 75-metre pier added in 1884. The pier featured a bandstand halfway along it and summer concerts were regularly held there for many years. By 1920, the pier had deteriorated so much that it had to be demolished. The concrete baths section, which resembles a small harbour out on the sands, remains; the baths still remain in Sandymount but they have fallen into disrepair mainly by storm damage.

=== Martello Tower ===
About halfway along the strand is the Sandymount Martello tower, part of a system of defences built to warn of an invasion by Napoleon. The Tower was a popular cafe in the 1960s. An attempt to turn the tower into a restaurant led to the installation of a large window with roller blinds on the seaward side of the tower. The restaurant never opened, leaving the tower with the modified window, and landscaped exterior abandoned on the strand. It is one of approximately 29 Martello Towers in the Greater Dublin Area and the closest to Dublin City and port.

=== Pubs===
A popular tavern existed close to Sandymount Green in the eighteenth century named The Conniving House. Opened in 1725, it became famous for its fish and ale and became a popular venue for music in the locality and wider city. Although the verb &#x27;connive&#x27; has negative connotations in modern English, at the time of the tavern&#x27;s establishment it was used to indicate &quot;a subversive indulgence of that which one ought to oppose&quot; as the venue allowed an opportunity for interaction between the &#x27;high&#x27; (or elite) musical culture in the city and what was perceived as &#x27;lower&#x27; vernacular musical culture. Such was its renown in the mid-eighteenth century, that it was depicted in John Rocque&#x27;s 1757 map entitled &quot;A Survey of the City, Harbour, Bay and Environs of Dublin on the same Scale as those of London, Paris &amp; Rome&quot;. The only verbal account of the venue comes from the book the &quot;Life of John Buncle, Esq.&quot; from 1766 by Thomas Amory, who heard the famous Larry Grogan playing the pipes there while Jack Lattin, &quot;the most agreeable of companions&quot;, played &quot;matchlessly&quot; on the fiddle. Other writers of the period, such as Laurence Whyte and Charles Coffey, recorded an energetic native musical culture in the venue.

===Sandymount Green===
Sandymount Green is a triangular park located next to the village. The houses along the south side of the green are part of what once was Sandymount Castle and the roads behind this bear the name. There are shops, restaurants and cafés around the green.

===Sandymount Strand===
The extensive Sandymount Strand, which is part of the South Bull, (a mirror to the North Bull sandbank, which grew into North Bull Island), is a major component of the south side of Dublin Bay. The strand runs from the curve of the bay at Ringsend to Merrion Gates. Sandymount Strand is a popular place for locals to take a walk. People and cars have been occasionally trapped by the incoming tide.

The promenade is a 2.5 km walkway along the coast from Gilford Avenue to Saint Alban&#x27;s Park, however, there are plans to lengthen the promenade to connect with the S2S Sandycove to Sutton Cycleway.

==Sport and leisure==

The area of Sandymount has three cricket clubs - YMCA (the 2020 All-Ireland champions), Pembroke and Railway Union, and a number of internationals line out for these clubs. For example, when Ireland beat England in an ODI in Southampton in August 2020, six of the 11 players were members of these three clubs, including captain Andy Balbirnie, and Kevin O&#x27;Brien, who in 2011 (also in a win over England) scored the fastest ever century in a World Cup. The three clubs have 14 men&#x27;s teams and a large (more variable) number of youth and women&#x27;s teams. Kim Garth, who has played for Perth Scorchers in the WBBL and is currently seeking to qualify for Australia women, was a member of Pembroke before leaving for a contract in Australia.

The Gaelic Athletic Association club Clanna Gael Fontenoy operates in the area, with grounds between Sandymount, Irishtown and Ringsend, and attracts some players from Sandymount, although a majority come from Irishtown and Ringsend.. Gaelic football, hurling and Camogie have become popular in the Sandymount area with over 350 families in the wider area (including Irishtown and Ringsend) being members of the club. This club has seen much success, at both club and county levels. In 2019 and 2021 the U16 Football teams became Champions of Dublin, and several players on both those teams are from Sandymount.

The sport of rugby is also prominent in the area, with local clubs including Monkstown F.C. and Railway Union. There are also two gymnasia/fitness clubs.

Hockey is also represented by Pembroke Wanderers H.C. on Serpentine Avenue, in the area since 1922.

Epworth Badminton Club has club nights twice a week in the village and also runs a summer club.

=== Parkrun ===
Poolbeg parkrun takes place every Saturday at 9:30 at Sean Moore Park.

==Religion==
The Church of Ireland Church of &quot;St John of the Evangelist&quot; is located at the top of St John&#x27;s Road. The Catholic church in Sandymount is dedicated to &quot;Our Lady Star of the Sea&quot; and is near the north end of Sandymount Road. &quot;Christ Church&quot;, on Sandymount Green, is a Methodist church, Mount Tabor nursing home shares the grounds of the church.

The area is also home to a house of the Franciscan Missionary Sisters for Africa.

==Governance==
Sandymount is in the local electoral area for elections to Dublin City Council and in the Dáil constituency of Dublin Bay South.

==History==
Sandymount was once part of the Pembroke Township, which took its name from the fact that this area was part of the estate of the Earl of Pembroke.

==Popular culture==
===Literary references===
Sandymount Strand is the most famous beach in Irish fiction, James Joyce based two episodes of his epic novel &quot;Ulysses&quot; here:
On the morning of Bloomsday, in the Proteus episode, Stephen Dedalus wanders &quot;into eternity&quot; on the strand; later the same day, Leopold Bloom sits on a rock and watches while young Gertie lifts her skirt as Bloom pleasures himself. It was this incident in the Nausicaa episode which led to the banning of the book in the USA for alleged obscenity.

<text>Crazy Magazine is an illustrated satire and humor magazine that was published by Marvel Comics from 1973 to 1983 for a total of 94 regular issues (and a &quot;Super Special&quot; (Summer 1975)). It was preceded by two standard-format comic books titled &quot;Crazy&quot;. The magazine&#x27;s format followed in the tradition of &quot;Mad&quot;, &quot;Sick&quot;, &quot;Cracked&quot; and &quot;National Lampoon&quot;.

Many comic book artists and writers contributed to the effort in the early years. These included Stan Lee, Will Eisner, Vaughn Bodé, Frank Kelly Freas, Harvey Kurtzman, Mike Ploog, Basil Wolverton, Marie Severin, Mike Carlin, editor Marv Wolfman and executive editor Roy Thomas. Mainstream writers like Harlan Ellison and Art Buchwald also contributed. Lee Marrs supplied a few pictures. In addition to drawn art, &quot;Crazy&quot; experimented with fumetti.

==History==
Marvel Comics (then known as Atlas Comics) first published a &quot;Crazy&quot; comic book in 1953. It ran for seven issues, through mid-1954, and was focused on popular culture parodies and humor. The second comic title, as &quot;Crazy!&quot;, ran for three issues in 1973, and reprinted comics parodies from Marvel&#x27;s late-1960s &quot;Not Brand Echh&quot;. Later that year, Marvel repurposed the title for a black-and-white comics magazine. Marv Wolfman edited the first ten issues from 1973–1975 and the first &quot;Super Special&quot;, and created the magazine&#x27;s first mascot, a short, bug-eyed man in a large black hat and draped in a black cape. Initially unnamed, the mascot was dubbed &quot;The Nebbish&quot; in issue #9 (Feb. 1975) and later &quot;Irving Nebbish&quot;. Wolfman recalled, &quot;Stan Lee wanted it to be more &quot;Mad&quot;/&quot;Cracked&quot;, where I wanted it more &quot;Lampoon&quot;. We sort of split the difference.&quot;

Steve Gerber, who served as &quot;Crazy&quot;″s editor from issues #11-14, and wanted it to be distinctive from the archetypal &quot;Mad&quot;, said that the goal was to present work that implied the creators were themselves insane. Gerber&#x27;s own contributions were often prose stories with a handful of illustrations, such as the &quot;Just Plain Folks&quot; series of bizarre biographies. The last issue of his run as editor included a darkly comic short story he wrote in college, &quot;...And the Birds Hummed Dirges!&quot;, about high-school kids who make a suicide pact.

Paul Lamont edited issue #15 (Jan. 1976) and Paul Laikin edited #16-60 and #62 (May 1980). Lamont was a pen name for Laikin.

By 1979, &quot;Crazy&quot; was struggling in sales. In 1980, the Irving Nebbish mascot was replaced with the belligerent Obnoxio the Clown, who made his first appearance in issue #63 (June 1980), the first regular issue edited by Larry Hama, who had also edited issue #61 (April 1980).

&quot;Crazy Magazine&quot;″s last issue was #94 (April 1983).

In December 2019, Marvel published a one-shot &quot;Crazy&quot; featuring new material and two variant covers. Mark Paniccia was the editor. This issue was reprinted, along with other superhero-related features from &quot;Crazy&quot; #9, #20, #22, #28, #31, #39, #42, #57, #59-60, #62-63, #65-66, #68-72, #75-90 and #92-94, in a 248-page trade paperback the following year.

<text>Sick is a satirical-humor magazine published from 1960 to 1980, lasting 134 issues.

==Overview==
&quot;Sick&quot; was created in 1960 by comic-book writer-artist Joe Simon, who also edited the title until the late 1960s. His son Jim Simon edited the magazine for several issues in 1976 to 1977. The magazine was published by Crestwood Publications until issue #62 (1968), when it was taken over by Hewfred Publications. Charlton Comics took over publishing the magazine in 1976 with issue #109.

&quot;Sick&quot;&#x27;s original mascot was a blank-faced little physician. He was later replaced by a mascot named Huckleberry Fink, whose design was similar to that of &quot;Mad&quot; Alfred E. Neuman, and whose motto, instead of Neuman&#x27;s &quot;What, me worry?&quot;, was &quot;Why Try Harder?&quot;

Its contributors included &quot;Mad&quot; regulars Angelo Torres and Jack Davis, as well as Howard Cruse, Arnold Drake, Ernie Schroeder, Washington correspondent Jim Atkins, and B.K. Taylor. Its art director from 1961 until his death in 1967 was the noted comic-book artist Bob Powell.

In his book &quot;American Comic Book Chronicles 1960–1964&quot;, comic book historian John Wells comments:

<text>Cracked was an American humor magazine. Founded in 1958, &quot;Cracked&quot; proved to be the most durable of the many publications to be launched in the wake of &quot;Mad&quot; magazine.

In print, &quot;Cracked&quot; conspicuously copied &quot;Mad&quot;″s layouts and style, and even featured a simpleminded, wide-cheeked mascot, a janitor named Sylvester P. Smythe on its covers, in a manner similar to &quot;Mad&quot;″s Alfred E. Neuman. Unlike Neuman, who appears primarily on covers, Smythe sometimes spoke and was frequently seen inside the magazine, interacting with parody subjects and other regular characters. A 1998 reader contest led to Smythe finally getting a full middle name: &quot;Phooey.&quot; An article on Cracked.com, the website which adopted &quot;Cracked&quot;&#x27;s name after the magazine ceased publication, joked that the magazine was &quot;created as a knock-off of &quot;Mad&quot; magazine just over 50 years ago&quot;, and it &quot;spent nearly half a century with a fan base primarily people who got to the store after &quot;Mad&quot; sold out.&quot;

&quot;Cracked&quot;″s publication frequency was reduced in the 1990s, and was erratic in the 2000s. In 2006, the magazine was revived with a new editorial formula that represented a significant departure from its prior &quot;Mad&quot; style. The new format was more akin to &quot;lad&quot; magazines like &quot;Maxim&quot; and &quot;FHM.&quot; The new formula, however, was unsuccessful and &quot;Cracked&quot; again canceled its print magazine in February 2007 after three issues. Later that year, the brand was carried over to a website, Cracked.com, now owned by Literally Media.
==Early staff==

The magazine&#x27;s first editor was Sol Brodsky, who was better known as a journeyman artist and later production manager and a publishing vice president at Marvel Comics.

&quot;Cracked&quot;″s original publisher, Robert C. Sproul&#x27;s Major Publications, often imitated other companies&#x27; successes in various genres, such as westerns, men&#x27;s adventure, and the Warren Publications mid-1960s revival of horror comics.

Editor Terry Bisson later recalled, &quot;The whole company was about lowball imitations. The publisher, Robert Sproul, wanted to put out some imitations of western, romance and astrology mags, and I was hired (at about age 27) to put them together because of my romance mag experience... The pseudomags did pretty well (this was a very low end market).&quot; Many of the &quot;Cracked&quot; contributors also worked on these titles. A number of monster-themed issues were printed under the &quot;Cracked&quot; umbrella, capitalizing on such publications as &quot;Fangoria&quot; and &quot;Famous Monsters of Filmland&quot;. Sproul published &quot;Cracked&quot; into the 1980s.

However, even as the company chased publishing trends, its long-running flagship title was &quot;Cracked Magazine&quot;—or Cracked Mazagine, as its cover often read, deliberately misspelling &quot;magazine&quot;. (In the same vein, the magazine&#x27;s website Cracked.com originally referred to itself as a &quot;.&quot;) 

==Artists==
Some notable artists provided art for &quot;Cracked&quot;, in particular John Severin. Severin was one of the original artists on &quot;Mad&quot;, and he worked heavily on EC Comics&#x27; war books. He was also one of the pre-eminent artists in Western comics. He eventually came to be best known as &quot;Cracked&quot;″s house cartoonist. For almost 40 years, he was the magazine&#x27;s mainstay artist, frequently illustrating multiple articles in the same issue and virtually all of its covers. Reacting to his own company&#x27;s obituary of Severin in 2012, Fantagraphics co-publisher Kim Thompson wrote, &quot;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m [alone] in thinking of &quot;Cracked&quot; for most of its run as &#x27;a bunch of crap, and John Severin.

The magazine also regularly featured good girl artist Bill Ward, comic book stalwart Howard Nostrand, and gag cartoonists Don Orehek and Charles Rodrigues. In later years, the magazine was a useful training ground for such future independent comic book creators as Rick Altergott, Dan Clowes, and Peter Bagge. Clowes later discussed his childhood ambivalence for the magazine with an interviewer: &quot;No one was ever a fan of &quot;Cracked&quot;. We would buy &quot;Mad&quot; every month, but about two weeks later we would get anxious for new material. We would tell ourselves, &#x27;OK, we are not going to buy &quot;Cracked&quot;. Never again!&#x27; And we&#x27;d hold out for a while, but then as the month dragged on it just became, &#x27;OK, I guess I&#x27;ll buy &quot;Cracked&quot;.&#x27; Then you&#x27;d bring it home, and immediately you&#x27;d remember, &#x27;Oh yeah, I hate &quot;Cracked&quot;!

Other name artists who contributed at least once to &quot;Cracked&quot; include such &quot;Mad&quot; veterans as Jack Davis, Will Elder, Al Jaffee, Don Martin, and Basil Wolverton, and such future &quot;Mad&quot; contributors as Jack Rickard, Angelo Torres, Bill Wray, Greg Theakston, Dennis Snee, Mike Snider, Dean Norman, Charlie Kadau, May Sakami and Tom Richmond. Others included Marvel Comics regulars Steve Ditko and Gene Colan. Jack Kirby contributed once in 1960. In its later days, &quot;Cracked&quot; found it difficult to attract and retain the level of talent that the better-paying, better-selling &quot;Mad&quot; could. Richmond, who drew four articles for &quot;Cracked&quot;, reported on his webpage that he was paid just $100 for a finished page, a small fraction of what he earned for his first &quot;Mad&quot; assignment. Richmond also wrote about the bad feeling caused by his short tenure at &quot;Cracked&quot;: &quot;[Editor Dick Kulpa] was very upset about my leaving Cracked for &quot;Mad&quot;, but let&#x27;s be real ... not doing so would have been the same as a minor league Triple-A shortstop refusing a call up to the majors. That was no decision at all.&quot; Mike Snider had been submitting to both publications, and made the move to &quot;Mad&quot; after it accepted an article that had already been okayed by &quot;Cracked&quot;; Snider was obliged to rescind his submission to the lower-paying magazine. One publisher who looked into buying the &quot;Cracked&quot; operation felt that &quot;Mad&quot; was &quot;in a class by itself&quot; and that &quot;&quot;Cracked&quot; couldn&#x27;t top &quot;Mad&#x27;s&quot; lineup&quot;.

==Articles and features==
A typical issue of &quot;Cracked&quot; included two TV or movie parodies illustrated by Severin. The magazine also published &quot;interview&quot; articles featuring the recurring character Nanny Dickering (Nancy Dickerson was then an investigative newscaster).

One of the magazine&#x27;s longest-running features was &quot;Shut-Ups&quot;, which were two-panel gags in which a character would make an observation or excuse in the first panel, and then be told to &quot;SHUT UP&quot; in the second, as the true situation was visually revealed. &quot;Hudd &amp; Dini&quot; by Vic Martin, a gag strip about two convicts&#x27; failed schemes to escape prison, also ran frequently, as did John Severin&#x27;s Western strip &quot;Sagebrush.&quot; Other recurring features included &quot;Ye Hang-Ups&quot;, &quot;The Talking Blob&quot;, &quot;Spies vs. Sabs&quot; (originally &quot;Saboteurs &amp; Investigators&quot;) and, in the 1980s, &quot;the Uggly Family&quot; by Daniel Clowes.

===Books===
==== Ace Books ====
Ace Books published four &quot;Cracked&quot; collections, &quot;The Cracked Reader&quot; (K-111 NA, 1960), &quot;More Cracked&quot;, &quot;Completely Cracked&quot; and &quot;Cracked Again&quot; (M-146, 1965). Sproul was listed as editor of the 1960 book.

====Dell Books====
Dell Publishing produced six collections; &quot;Get Me Cracked&quot;, &quot;Half-Cracked&quot;, &quot;Cracked Up&quot;, &quot;Your Cracked&quot;, &quot;Cracked in the Saddle&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s a Cracked World&quot;.

==International editions==
In the mid-1970s, &quot;Cracked&quot; moved into foreign markets. In Great Britain, they produced &quot;Cracked British Edition&quot;, which consisted entirely of reprinted material from the American magazine edited to localize spelling and pop-culture references. In Germany, there were three publications that included &quot;Cracked&quot; reprints. First was &quot;Kaputt&quot;, which ran from 1974 to 1983; it was followed by &quot;Stupid&quot;, which ran from 1983 to 1984, and, finally, &quot;Panic&quot;. All magazines used original material in addition to the translated &quot;Cracked&quot; reprints. Articles were often colorized, particularly in &quot;Stupid&quot;, or printed in black and white with a single added color. Covers were original, but were often reworkings of previous &quot;Cracked&quot; covers. It was published in Brazil under the name &quot;Pancada&quot; by Editora Abril, from 1977 to 1980. The content was translated from the English original and adapted to the Brazilian reality of the time (the Democratic and Republican parties were substituted respectively by ARENA and MDB, political parties of that era), and football jokes were made into soccer jokes. Most covers were reused from the original American magazine, but some were made by local artists. Two attempts were made in the 1990s to launch the magazine in Australia.

==&quot;Mad&quot; raid==
In 1985, Mort Todd became editor of &quot;Cracked&quot; magazine at age 23. In 1987, &quot;Cracked&quot; made waves in the comic industry by seemingly raiding cartoonist Don Martin from rival &quot;Mad&quot;, after Martin&#x27;s 32-year career there. Martin had left &quot;Mad&quot; months earlier due to a business dispute.

Martin worked for &quot;Cracked&quot; for about six years, and the magazine, in a tweak at its rival, billed him as &quot;&quot;Cracked&quot;″s Crackedest Artist&quot;. &quot;Cracked&quot;″s concurrent attempt to sign &quot;Mad&quot;″s caricaturist Mort Drucker was unsuccessful, but the magazine did acquire longtime &quot;Mad&quot; contributor Lou Silverstone as editor and writer. Former &quot;Mad&quot; associate editor Jerry DeFuccio also worked at &quot;Cracked&quot; for a short period.

Though sales of &quot;Cracked&quot; always lagged far behind those of &quot;Mad&quot;, &quot;Cracked&quot; endured for more than four decades through low pay rates and overhead, and by being part of large publishing groups that could bundle &quot;Cracked&quot; in with its other magazines as a package arrangement for distributors. &quot;Cracked&quot; also appeared monthly during the period when &quot;Mad&quot; was being published just 8 times a year, thus picking up readership from &quot;Mad&quot; fans that couldn&#x27;t wait out the six weeks for their next &quot;comedy fix.&quot; The magazine sometimes included attention-grabbing giveaways inside its pages, such as iron-ons, stickers or postcards.

In the 1990s, &quot;Cracked&quot; also benefited from the collapse of the &quot;National Lampoon&quot;, picking up Andy Simmons as an editor, as well as such former &quot;Lampoon&quot; contributors as Ron Barrett, Randy Jones, and Ed Subitzky. In 1995, Greg Grabianski began his career as a writer and associate editor at &quot;Cracked&quot; before going on to write for TV and film projects including &quot;Beavis &amp; Butthead&quot; and the &quot;Scary Movie&quot; franchise.

==Rise and decline==
At its height, &quot;Cracked&quot;″s circulation might have been a third of &quot;Mad&quot;″s, with the overall total generally rising or falling along with the bigger magazine&#x27;s fortunes. But at its nadir in the 2000s, this sales figure plunged to around 25,000–35,000 per bi-monthly issue, or about one-eighth of &quot;Mad&quot;″s monthly circulation, which had also plummeted from its mid-1970s peak of over 2 million per issue.

In late 1999, &quot;Cracked&quot;″s then-parent company, Globe Communications (publisher of the national tabloid &quot;The Globe&quot;), was sold to American Media, Inc., the company that publishes the tabloids &quot;The National Enquirer&quot; and the &quot;Weekly World News&quot;. American Media&#x27;s primary interest in the deal was in acquiring its rival, &quot;The Globe&quot;, but &quot;Cracked&quot; came along as part of the transaction. Writer/editor Barry Dutter said, &quot;One thing you have to realize is that AMI never wanted &quot;Cracked&quot;; it was just part of a package they bought from Globe Communications.&quot;

American Media moved Globe Communications&#x27; New York City operations to Florida, where American Media was headquartered. As a result, &quot;Cracked&quot;″s offices moved to Florida as well. Most of the magazine&#x27;s long-term editors and writers did not move to Florida, leading to a large turnover in &quot;Cracked&quot;″s staff. Published reports indicate that American Media never had an interest in supporting the magazine, which was only selling in the high five figures, compared with AMI&#x27;s multi-million-selling line of tabloids. &quot;Cracked&quot;″s distribution under American Media grew increasingly sporadic.

In 2000, American Media sold &quot;Cracked&quot; to one of its former &quot;Weekly World News&quot; employees, Dick Kulpa, who became both Publisher and Editor-in-Chief of &quot;Cracked&quot;. Under Kulpa, &quot;Cracked&quot; suffered from a lack of financing. Combined with &quot;Cracked&quot;″s weakened distribution, circulation continued to drop precipitously, and Kulpa was forced to turn the magazine into a bi-monthly. Dark Horse &quot;Star Wars&quot; comic editor Peet Janes briefly joined the staff, but financial difficulties at the magazine ended his tenure very quickly. Later, after being offered a substantial pay cut, signature artist John Severin parted company with the magazine.

&quot;Cracked&quot; was near the center of the 2001 anthrax scare. An anonymous letter containing anthrax powder was sent to American Media Inc. in September 2001, killing one employee. &quot;Cracked&quot;″s offices were still in the same building, and thus the magazine was among the publications that had to be evacuated. As a consequence, the company&#x27;s archives, containing the magazine&#x27;s original photographic prints of issues from 1958–2000, had to be destroyed due to contamination. The attack caused Kulpa to put out only four issues that year.

In 2004, Kulpa, new editors Scott Gosar and Marten Jallad, and now Promotions Editor Mark Van Woert, who had been with the magazine since 2000 as its webmaster, attempted one last resuscitation of the original title.

In an effort to generate publicity, Cheap Trick guitarist Rick Nielsen was named as the magazine&#x27;s new &quot;publisher,&quot; but this failed to spark interest. The 365th and final issue featured an &quot;Election Year&quot; cover by science fiction artist Frank Kelly Freas, who had provided many of &quot;Mad&quot; magazine&#x27;s covers from 1958–62.

==Sale and rebirth as Cracked.com==

In early 2005, Kulpa sold &quot;Cracked&quot; to Teshkeel Media Group, a federation of Arab, Asian, and American investors, who announced plans to revive &quot;Cracked&quot; with a new editorial focus and redesign. Its first steps included naming entrepreneur Monty Sarhan as both CEO and publisher. Writer Neal Pollack was named &quot;editor-at-large&quot;, and former editor Mort Todd was named a contributing editor. However, Todd quickly departed, complaining to &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; about low pay rates and work-for-hire issues of copyright. Todd said, &quot;With each visit to the offices I got more dispirited as I saw the direction the magazine was taking. As has been well publicized, Cracked was, instead of ripping off MAD, going to rip off Maxim... A lot of &#x27;revolutionary&#x27; humor ideas they&#x27;ve come up with are ones that have been overplayed for decades and ones I rejected for good reason 20 years ago [as Cracked&#x27;s editor]&quot;.

Publisher Sarhan responded:

My impression of Mort was that he was stuck in a time warp, wanted to relive his personal &quot;glory days&quot; when he edited CRACKED and didn’t get what we were trying to do... A Contributing Editor is a freelancer with whom we have a relationship with. That is all that the title means here at CRACKED. He&#x27;s a person who is a regular contributor to the magazine, but he is not on staff ... Mort quit as a Contributing Editor because, he said, he had a few TV projects in development. My personal opinion is that he was stuck in the &quot;Cracked&quot; of the past and that he didn&#x27;t like being a freelancer, answering to editors far younger than him here at &quot;Cracked&quot; and having his ideas regularly rejected. If your work isn&#x27;t going to get published, it makes no sense to stay ... Anyone who has spent five minutes on this website knows that we are not a &quot;Maxim&quot; clone. It&#x27;s a ridiculous assertion. We focus on comedy and humor, not women in bikinis. Yes, it&#x27;s true that we look to MAXIM as a guide for some things. After all, since it&#x27;s [sic] launch over eight years ago, it has gone on to become one of the most successful magazine titles ever. Who wouldn&#x27;t want to emulate that success?

On August 15, 2006, the revamped &quot;Cracked&quot; magazine finally appeared. The first issue was a significant departure from &quot;Cracked&quot;″s previous incarnation, notably in its sharp reduction of comics and illustrated content. The new format was more text-heavy, and was overtly indebted to modern &quot;lad mags&quot; like &quot;Maxim&quot;, &quot;Stuff&quot; and &quot;FHM&quot;, although the media website Gawker.com wrote, &quot;Very little remains of the old &quot;Cracked&quot; – a &quot;Mad&quot; ripoff that had tread water in various incarnations for almost half a century. Much was made of the new direction now ripping off &quot;Maxim&quot; instead, but aside from a &quot;look and feel&quot; resemblance in terms of layout, the much more obvious (attempted) homage runs to &quot;Spy&quot;.&quot;

&quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Peter Carlson harshly reviewed the debut, listing some of the issue&#x27;s contents and then adding, &quot;Are you chuckling yet? Me neither.&quot; Carlson quoted Cracked&#x27;s Michael J. Nelson, who&#x27;d contributed a short guide to the worst comedy movies ever, saying &quot;Bad comedies are worse than anything else in the whole of human history.&quot; Carlson commented, &quot;Reading Cracked, you understand exactly what he means.&quot; 

After three poor-selling issues, the failing magazine was canceled in February 2007. Citing distribution problems for its demise, editor Jay Pinkerton claimed that the remaining staff would be focusing its energies toward the &quot;Cracked&quot; website, as well as unspecified book projects. The company&#x27;s website, Cracked.com, continued on and has become known for its humorous lists and compilations, such as &quot;6 Most Ridiculous Things People Claimed to Legally Own&quot;. A book collection in that vein, &quot;You Might be a Zombie, and Other Bad News&quot;, was published in 2010.

A two-volume history of the magazine, &quot;If You&#x27;re Cracked, You&#x27;re Happy&quot;, written by Mark Arnold, was published in June 2011.

<text>The Mayor of Casterbridge: The Life and Death of a Man of Character is an 1886 novel by the English author Thomas Hardy. One of Hardy&#x27;s Wessex novels, it is set in a fictional rural England with Casterbridge standing in for Dorchester in Dorset where the author spent his youth. It was first published as a weekly serialisation from January 1886.

The novel is considered to be one of Hardy&#x27;s masterpieces, although it has been criticised for incorporating too many incidents, a consequence of the author trying to include something in every weekly published instalment.

==Plot==
At a country fair at Weydon Priors in Wessex, Michael Henchard, a 21-year-old hay-trusser, argues with his wife Susan. Drunk on rum-laced furmity he auctions her off, along with their baby daughter Elizabeth-Jane, to Richard Newson, a sailor, for five guineas. Sober and remorseful the next day, he is unable to find his family. He vows not to touch liquor again for 21 years.

Believing the auction to be legally binding, Susan lives as Newson&#x27;s wife for 18 years. After Newson is lost at sea, Susan, lacking any means of support, decides to seek out Henchard again, taking her daughter with her. Susan has told Elizabeth-Jane little about Henchard, and the young woman knows only that he is a relation by marriage. Susan discovers that Henchard has become a very successful hay and grain merchant and mayor of Casterbridge, known for his staunch sobriety. He has avoided explaining how he lost his wife, allowing people to assume he is a widower.

When the couple are reunited, Henchard proposes remarrying Susan after a sham courtship, this in his view being the simplest and most discreet way to remedy matters and to prevent Elizabeth-Jane learning of their disgrace. To do this, however, he is forced to break off an engagement with a woman named Lucetta Templeman, who had nursed him when he was ill.

Donald Farfrae, a young and energetic Scotsman passing through Casterbridge, helps Henchard by showing him how to salvage substandard grain he has bought. Henchard takes a liking to the man, persuades him not to emigrate, and hires him as his corn factor, rudely turning away a man named Jopp to whom he had already offered the job. Farfrae is extremely successful in the role, and increasingly outshines his employer. When he catches the eye of Elizabeth-Jane, Henchard dismisses him and Farfrae sets himself up as an independent merchant. Farfrae conducts himself with scrupulous honesty, but Henchard is so determined to ruin his rival that he makes risky business decisions that prove disastrous.

Susan falls ill and dies shortly after the couple&#x27;s remarriage, leaving Henchard a letter to be opened on the day of Elizabeth-Jane&#x27;s wedding. Henchard reads the letter, which is not properly sealed, and learns that Elizabeth-Jane is not in fact his daughter, but Newson&#x27;s – his Elizabeth-Jane having died as an infant. Henchard&#x27;s new knowledge causes him to behave coldly towards the second Elizabeth-Jane.

Elizabeth-Jane accepts a position as companion to Lucetta, a newcomer, unaware that she had had a relationship with Henchard which resulted in her social ruin. Now wealthy after receiving an inheritance from her aunt, and learning that Henchard&#x27;s wife had died, Lucetta has come to Casterbridge to marry him. However, on meeting Farfrae, she becomes attracted to him, and he to her.

Henchard&#x27;s financial difficulties persuade him that he should marry Lucetta quickly. But she is in love with Farfrae, and the couple run away one weekend to get married, not telling Henchard until after the fact. Henchard&#x27;s credit collapses and he goes bankrupt. Farfrae buys Henchard&#x27;s old business and tries to help Henchard by employing him as a journeyman.

Lucetta asks Henchard to return her old love letters, and Henchard asks Jopp to take them to her. Jopp, who still bears a grudge for having been cheated out of the position of factor, opens the letters and reads them out loud at an inn. Some of the townspeople publicly shame Henchard and Lucetta, creating effigies of them in a skimmington ride. Lucetta is so devastated by the spectacle that she collapses, has a miscarriage, and dies.

The next day, Newson – who it transpires was not lost at sea – arrives at Henchard&#x27;s door asking about his daughter. Henchard, who has come to value her kindness to him, is afraid of losing her companionship and tells Newson she is dead. Newson leaves in sorrow. After 21 years, Henchard&#x27;s vow of abstinence expires, and he starts drinking again.

Eventually discovering that he has been lied to, Newson returns, and Henchard disappears rather than endure a confrontation. On the day of Elizabeth-Jane&#x27;s wedding to Farfrae, Henchard comes back, timidly seeking a reconciliation. She rebuffs him, and he departs for good. Later, regretting her coldness, she and Farfrae set out to find him. They arrive too late, and learn that he has died alone. They also find his last written statement: his dying wish is to be forgotten.

==Setting and date==
The book is one of Hardy&#x27;s Wessex novels, and is set largely in the fictional town of Casterbridge, based on Dorchester in Dorset. The author intended Casterbridge to be an imaginative presentation of certain aspects of the town as he remembered it in the &quot;dream&quot; of his childhood.

Although the opening sentence of the novel states that the events described took place &quot;before the nineteenth century had reached one-third of its span&quot; the date of Hardy&#x27;s own childhood places it rather later – in the mid-to-late 1840s.

===Inspiration===

The concept of a man selling his wife was not new in Hardy&#x27;s era. His story is set in the first half of the 19th century, when various newspapers reported instances of men selling their wives. For example, in Huddersfield on 19 August 1806, a tradesman named Gledhill accepted half a guinea () for his &quot;young and beautiful&quot; wife and &quot;delivered her to the purchaser at the Market Cross before a great concourse of people&quot;, &quot;who wished the purchaser good luck of his bargain&quot;. In October 1830 a Sheffield man sold his wife in the market at Rotherham for three pence (). In 1849 a more complex sale-of-wife story came to light on Hardy&#x27;s patch, in Dorset. Around 1830 one Simon Mitchell sold his wife for £2 (). The wife and purchaser subsequently lived together and had seven children. However, by 1849 Mitchell&#x27;s wife was in the Taunton workhouse, and three of her children had died of an epidemic there. Mitchell, now described as an &quot;old man&quot;, was summonsed on the grounds that he should support his wife, but:

The magistrates looking at the matter in an equitable point of view considered it unfair that Mitchell, under these circumstances, should be called upon to support a family not his own, even though he was a consenting party to the adulterous connexion of his partner with another man, and therefore refused an order.

==First publication and early reception==
Hardy started work on &quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; in the spring of 1884, after a three-year pause. He completed it in a little over a year, and it was first issued in weekly parts in January 1886, followed by full publication in May 1886. A reader for the publisher, Smith, Elder &amp; Co. was not impressed and complained that the lack of gentry among the characters made it uninteresting. It was issued with a small print run of only 750 copies.

Hardy himself felt that in his efforts to get an incident into almost every weekly instalment he had added events to the narrative somewhat too freely, resulting in over-elaboration. However, he was deeply affected, telling a friend that the novel was the only tragedy that made him weep while writing it.

==Later appreciation==
In her 2006 biography of Thomas Hardy, the author Claire Tomalin called the book a masterpiece, a deeply imagined dramatic and poetic work, with a narrative on a grand scale and paced with extraordinary moments. She praised it as being built on the territory in which Hardy worked best, in which the rural landscape is drawn with a naturalist&#x27;s eye and in which country people play out their lives between custom and education, work and ideas, and love of place and experience of change. Hardy&#x27;s portrait of Henchard – &quot;depressive, black-tempered, self-destructive, and also lovable as a child is lovable&quot; – she considered one of his strongest achievements. She did concur with Hardy, however, in noting that he tried to pack in too many incidents.

<text>A base metal is a common and inexpensive metal, as opposed to a precious metal such as gold or silver. In numismatics, coins often derived their value from the precious metal content; however, base metals have also been used in coins in the past and today.

==Specific definitions==
In contrast to noble metals, base metals may be distinguished by oxidizing or corroding relatively easily and reacting variably with diluted hydrochloric acid (HCl) to form hydrogen. Examples include iron, nickel, lead and zinc. Copper is also considered a base metal because it oxidizes relatively easily, although it does not react with HCl.

In mining and economics, the term base metals refers to industrial non-ferrous metals excluding precious metals. These include copper, lead, nickel and zinc.

The U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency is more inclusive in its definition of commercial base metals. Its list includes—in addition to copper, lead, nickel, and zinc—the following metals: iron and steel (an alloy), aluminium, tin, tungsten, molybdenum, tantalum, cobalt, bismuth, cadmium, titanium, zirconium, antimony, manganese, beryllium, chromium, germanium, vanadium, gallium, hafnium, indium, niobium, rhenium, and thallium, and their alloys.

==Other uses==
In the context of plated metal products, the base metal underlies the plating metal, as copper underlies silver in Sheffield plate.

<doc id="418810" wikidata="Q7272320" url="?curid=418810" title="Quinnsworth">
<text>Quinnsworth was a supermarket chain that operated in Ireland from 1966 to 1997. During its time in operation, it grew to be one of Ireland&#x27;s leading retailers, with approximately one quarter of the grocery market in the Republic of Ireland, and some 88 supermarkets across the island of Ireland, including its &quot;Crazy Prices&quot; brand operated at some of its larger outlets. It was acquired by UK chain Tesco in 1997, with its supermarkets being gradually rebranded as &quot;Tesco Ireland&quot; over the following four years.

==Formation and development==
Quinnsworth was founded by Leitrim-born Pat Quinn. Quinn had worked as General Manager of the H Williams supermarket chain and had proposed that the chain open a supermarket in the Stillorgan Shopping Centre. H Williams rejected the proposal, and Quinn decided to open a supermarket there himself in December 1966, which became the first shop in the Quinnsworth chain. By 1971, Quinnsworth had grown to six shops and had a turnover of IR£6 million. It opened its first supermarket outside of Dublin at Douglas, Cork in December 1971.

In 1972, the business, which by then had seven supermarkets (in Ballymun, Dundrum, Rathfarnham, Douglas, Wilton, Galway and Shannon), was acquired by Power Supermarkets Ltd, which in turn was owned by the Weston family and controlled the rival chain, &quot;Power&#x27;s Supermarkets&quot;. The Power&#x27;s supermarkets were rebranded under the &quot;Quinnsworth&quot; name.

==Acquisitions==
During the 1970s, the company was acquired by Associated British Foods plc. During that period, it used the slogan &quot;Let&#x27;s get it all together at Quinnsworth&quot;. It was one of the leading supermarket chains in Ireland in terms of turnover, and by 1978, it had 41 outlets, rising to 43 outlets in 1979 . It acquired rival chain &quot;Five Star&quot;, which had 26 outlets, for IR£5 million in 1979.

By 1981, following the acquisition of Five Star, Quinnsworth had 71 supermarkets. That same year, the business announced that it intended to close 7 of its 31 supermarkets in Dublin (in Baggot Street, Blackrock, Dolphin&#x27;s Barn, Finglas, Killester, Ranelagh and Rosemount). The Irish Association of Distributive Trades criticised this development as &quot;clear proof that the supermarket giants have now achieved monopolistic control of the Dublin grocery market&quot; and that the takeover of Five Star by Quinnsworth should not have been permitted. Quinnsworth responded by citing size limitations and a modernisation programme, and countered that it was carrying out a major expansion of its Rathfarnham supermarket that year, and that it intended to open a shopping centre in Artane, to extend its Ennis and Wexford shops, and to open new supermarkets in Tullamore and Navan in 1982. It contended that it had bigger and better outlets near the closing shops, including on Upper Baggot Street, where the acquired Five Star supermarket was located almost directly opposite the existing Quinnsworth outlet.

==Branding and promotion==
In the early 1980s, the business introduced the Crazy Prices brand, which had previously been used only in Northern Ireland, to the Republic of Ireland. The Crazy Prices brand was used on some of its larger outlets. These outlets were known for their low prices. Crazy Prices was one of the first retailers in Ireland to introduce late night opening (until 9pm) on Wednesdays, dubbing this night &quot;Crazy Night&quot; and running special in-store promotions. Until the mid-1990s, most Irish retailers only opened late one night a week, usually Thursday (in Dublin city) or Friday. KVI branding was Crazy Prices equivalent to the Quinnsworth Yellow pack. It came in blue red and white striped packaging. K.V.I. stood for &quot;Keen Value Item&quot; and was the equivalent of the previous Quinnsworth Yellow Pack, except perhaps even further downmarket.

One of Quinnsworth&#x27;s &quot;most memorable&quot; developments was the addition of the phrase Yellow Pack to the retailing lexicon. Towards the end of Quinnsworth&#x27;s life, Yellow Pack was replaced by K.V.I. label as the low-cost generic grocery brand, and a high quality generic line called Premium Choice modeled after Loblaws President&#x27;s Choice (Loblaws being owned by another branch of the Weston family). Quinnsworth was also remembered for its advertising campaigns featuring its marketing director (and later chief executive) Maurice Pratt, who would personally introduce new product promotions, ending each advert with the company slogan, &quot;That&#x27;s Real Value&quot;.

Quinnsworth grew to gain a 25% share of the Irish grocery market by the 1990s.

==Sale==
In 1996, Quinnsworth announced that it had taken a large unit in the new &quot;Golden Island Shopping Centre&quot;, which was due to open in late 1997. It was anticipated that its existing supermarket in the ageing &quot;Athlone Shopping Centre&quot; would be rebranded as Crazy Prices.

On 20 March 1997, it was announced that Quinnsworth, including its Crazy Prices outlets, had been acquired by the UK supermarket company, Tesco, for IR£630 million. By then, the business had 57 Quinnsworth-branded supermarkets, and 31 branded as Crazy Prices (21 in the Republic of Ireland and 10 in Northern Ireland). The acquisition also included Stewart&#x27;s Supermarkets in Northern Ireland. The first Tesco-branded supermarket was the unit acquired by Quinnsworth in the Golden Island Shopping Centre the previous year, which opened as Tesco rather than Quinnsworth in October 1997. All shops were rebranded over the following years, with the rebranding process almost completed by April 2001.

<text>Richard A. Vinroot (born April 14, 1941) is an American politician and attorney from Charlotte, North Carolina. He served as the 52nd Mayor of Charlotte from 1991 to 1995. Vinroot ran unsuccessfully for Governor of North Carolina in 1996, 2000 and 2004. The City of Charlotte&#x27;s Richard Vinroot International Achievement Award is named in his honor.

==Early life==
The son of a Swedish immigrant, Richard Vinroot was raised in Mecklenburg County schools becoming student body president at East Mecklenburg High School, where he graduated from in 1959. He was a high school athlete in three sports and captained the basketball and football teams. He won a Morehead Scholarship to attend the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1963 and a Juris Doctor degree in 1966. He served as class president in his junior and senior years. Vinroot&#x27;s height is billed at 6&#x27;7&quot;, and he played college basketball for the North Carolina Tar Heels under Dean Smith.

Vinroot married his wife Judy (Allen) Vinroot, whom he met while both were students at University of North Carolina. They have three children, Richard Vinroot Jr., Laura Vinroot Poole, and Katy Vinroot O&#x27;Brien, all of whom graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill.

==Military==
From January 1967 to 1968, he was in the United States Army where he served in the 1st Signal Brigade. After basic training at Fort Bragg, he was stationed at Fort Jackson, South Carolina for six months. In November 1967, he deployed to Vietnam during the Vietnam War and was awarded a Bronze Star Medal. While in Vietnam, he did legal assistance as part of the Judge Advocate Department of the 1st Signal Brigade.

==Political career==
Vinroot was a member of the Charlotte City Council from 1983 to 1991 and served as mayor of Charlotte from 1991 to 1995. As mayor, Vinroot was successful in establishing a Taxpayer Protection Act, limiting growth of the city&#x27;s budget. He created the state&#x27;s first &quot;drug court&quot; to speed prosecutions. He established the Mayor&#x27;s International Cabinet, a predecessor to the Charlotte International Cabinet. A national magazine named him Municipal Leader of the Year. Vinroot decided against running for a third term in order to focus full-time on his first run for North Carolina governor in 1996. Vinroot lost in a close primary to then-state representative Robin Hayes of Kannapolis. Hayes went on to lose the general election to incumbent governor Jim Hunt.

Vinroot ran again for governor in 2000, and secured the Republican nomination over state representative N. Leo Daughtry. He faced North Carolina&#x27;s attorney general, Mike Easley, in a bitterly contested election. Despite a favorable national Republican tide that won North Carolina for George W. Bush, Democrat Mike Easley won by 52% to 46%, and succeeded fellow Democrat Jim Hunt as governor. In the closing weeks of the race, actor Andy Griffith filmed an ad endorsing Easley, which some observers believe led to Easley&#x27;s victory, called the &quot;Mayberry Miracle&quot;.

In 2004, Vinroot attempted a third run for governor, but never made it past the Republican primary. He conceded the race to Wilmington State Senator Patrick J. Ballantine, who lost to Easley in November, 55.62% to 42.88%.

Since his retirement from politics, Vinroot has served on the boards of Martin-Marietta Materials, Inc. and the North Carolina Institute for Emerging Issues. He also was appointed to the search committee for the next chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2012.

==Legal practice==
Vinroot&#x27;s legal practice at the Charlotte-based firm of Robinson, Bradshaw &amp; Hinson concentrates in the areas of civil litigation including construction, labor, employment discrimination, and commercial disputes and controversies.

==Richard Vinroot International Achievement Award==

The Richard Vinroot International Achievement Award is presented by the City of Charlotte to recognize those who &quot;have worked for the continued internationalization of Charlotte... contributed to efforts to improve the international community... and have a record of outstanding service to the greater Charlotte community.&quot; Recipients are chosen by the Mayor of Charlotte and the award is presented annually at the Mayor&#x27;s International Community Awards event each spring. Recipients have included prominent leaders in government, non-profits, and academia.

<doc id="418813" wikidata="Q8051777" url="?curid=418813" title="Yellow Pack">
<text>Yellow Pack was a brand of generic groceries, first launched in March 1980 by Fine Fare, a British regional supermarket chain ultimately owned by the Weston family, whose extensive interests include the UK&#x27;s Associated British Foods, Loblaw Companies in North America, and a range of upmarket retailers such as Selfridges, Brown Thomas and Fortnum &amp; Mason.

Distinctively packaged in yellow with aggressive black print, under a brand name (&quot;YelLOW PRICE Packs&quot;) invented in January 1980 by the Collett Dickenson Pearce advertising agency, Yellow Packs, unlike previous generic grocery launches in North America and Europe, were positioned, next to a modestly successful own-label range, as the cheapest version of the product concerned available in Britain. 

In most cases, this involved product or packaging re-engineering, or uncovering of new sources. The range&#x27;s colour scheme design was derived from the No Name brand of generics launched a year or two earlier by Fine Fare&#x27;s Canadian sister grocery chain, Toronto-based Loblaws.

The Yellow Pack brand was reasonably successful, accounting for 30% of the chain&#x27;s grocery sales by the time Fine Fare was acquired by the Dee Corporation – then mostly trading as Gateway, now Somerfield – in mid 1986. It was then discontinued in Great Britain.

In the meantime, after initial internal hostility to someone else&#x27;s idea, the range was adopted by Fine fare&#x27;s Irish sister company, Quinnsworth, where it featured heavily in advertising presented by Quinnsworth&#x27;s advertising manager, Maurice Pratt. Whereas in Fine Fare&#x27;s Scottish and Teesside heartland, Yellow Packs had merely been a successful product launch, they acquired a semi-iconic status in Ireland, and were extended throughout Quinnsworth&#x27;s affiliate chains within the Power supermarket group (such as Stewarts and Crazy Prices in Northern Ireland and Crazy Prices in the Republic). 

The term &quot;Yellow Pack&quot; became a generic term for cheap products or low-paid jobs in Ireland.

As a promotional offer, Quinnsworth started offering reduced-price flights to its customers. These were soon given the nickname &quot;Yellow Pack Flights&quot;.

In the mid 1990s, Power Supermarkets began to phase out the Yellow Pack brand, replacing them with two new brands. Budget products were branded &quot;Five Star&quot; (later &quot;K.V.I&quot; (Keenest Value in Ireland)), and a more upmarket &quot;Premium Choice&quot; brand created for higher quality goods. After the acquisition of the Irish business by Tesco, the brand was completely replaced by Tesco own-brands, including the similar in concept Tesco Value, using white rather than yellow packaging). 

Tesco Value had been developed (as &quot;Value Lines&quot;) in 1981, as Tesco&#x27;s answer in Britain to Yellow Packs. Derived from the company&#x27;s Victor Value chain, Tesco&#x27;s Value range has, since the early 1980s played a consistent, though minor, role in Tesco&#x27;s repertoire of private brands.

<doc id="418816" wikidata="Q881215" url="?curid=418816" title="Mike Easley">
<text>Michael Francis Easley (born March 23, 1950) is an American lawyer and politician who served as the 72nd governor of North Carolina from 2001 to 2009. He is the first 
governor of North Carolina to have been convicted of a felony. The conviction was later expunged by the Chief Judge of the Superior Court of Wake County. 
A member of the Democratic Party, Easley was North Carolina&#x27;s second Catholic governor.

==Early life and education==
Mike Easley was born on March 23, 1950, in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, to Henry Alexander Easley and Huldah Marie Easley. He grew up on his family&#x27;s 60-acre farm in Nash County and was one of seven children in a large Irish Catholic family. Easley attended a local Catholic school before transferring and later graduating from Rocky Mount Senior High School in 1968. Easley attended Belmont Abbey College for two years before transferring to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he earned a degree with honors in political science in 1972. While at UNC he was a member of Phi Gamma Delta fraternity. He then attended the North Carolina Central University School of Law, earning his J.D. degree, with honors, in 1976. While a law student, Easley served as managing editor of the school&#x27;s Law Review.

==Family==
Easley is married to Mary Easley (née Pipines), who worked in the Provost&#x27;s Office at North Carolina State University until June 8, 2009. She is a former law professor at North Carolina Central University and also worked for ten years as a prosecutor. The two have one son, Michael F. Easley Jr.

==Career==

Easley became an assistant district attorney for the 13th Judicial District in 1976. He was elected District Attorney, one of the youngest ever in the state, in 1982.

A Democrat, Easley ran unsuccessfully in that party&#x27;s 1990 primary for the U.S. Senate; he lost to former Charlotte mayor Harvey Gantt, who himself lost to incumbent Jesse Helms. Easley was elected North Carolina Attorney General in 1992 and sworn in on January 9, 1993. He won reelection in 1996. In the 1996 election for attorney general, Easley garnered 59.07% of the vote, compared with opponent Robert H. Edmonds Jr.&#x27;s 40.93% of votes. This represented a margin of victory of 446,169 votes.

In 2000, Easley ran to succeed the term-limited Hunt as Governor of North Carolina. He defeated incumbent Lieutenant Governor Dennis A. Wicker in the Democratic primary, and then successfully challenged Republican Richard Vinroot, former mayor of Charlotte, in the general election. Easley was reelected in 2004, running against New Hanover County state senator Patrick J. Ballantine.

===Governorship===

In the closing weeks of the 2000 gubernatorial race, actor Andy Griffith filmed an ad endorsing Easley, which some observers believe led to Easley&#x27;s victory, called the &quot;Mayberry Miracle&quot;.

Education reform was a centerpiece of Easley&#x27;s tenure as governor, to such an extent that in 2008, Easley received the inaugural &quot;America&#x27;s Greatest Education Governor&quot; award from the National Education Association. The award was created to showcase &quot;public officials who have demonstrated exemplary achievements and accomplishments in advancing public education&quot;. Easley was commended by the NEA for his focus on improving teacher working conditions and for affording teachers a &quot;seat at the table&quot; in discussions surrounding the implementation of education reforms in the state.

One of Easley&#x27;s major programs was &quot;More at Four&quot;, an academic pre-kindergarten for at-risk children. &quot;More at Four&quot; has received praise from groups such as the National Education Association.

Another signature program of Easley&#x27;s was the &quot;Learn and Earn&quot; initiative, which enabled North Carolina high school students to earn college credit by taking online courses at no cost to them or to their families. The &quot;Learn and Earn&quot; program received the Innovations in American Government Award from Harvard Kennedy School. Presenting the award, Harvard noted that in &quot;2006-2007, rates of grade promotion and graduation for Learn and Earn participants were higher than the statewide average, with nearly half the Learn and Earn high schools seeing 100 percent promotion rates&quot;. Harvard also observed that these numbers have not &quot;been skewed by &quot;creaming&quot; that is counting of only high scoring children. The program purposely targets kids at risk, those for whom English is a second language[,] and those who would be first-generation college students.&quot; Easley also initiated a program to enable North Carolina students to attain a debt-free undergraduate education by receiving EARN Grants of up to $8,000 over two years. In 2007 Easley wrote and published a children&#x27;s book, &quot;Look Out, College, Here I Come!&quot; the proceeds of which fund a North Carolina education charity.

His tenure faced budget shortfalls, tough economic times, and natural disasters such as hurricanes and floods. Easley received mixed reviews on his handling of fiscal problems in the state. His supporters claimed many of the budget shortfall situations were created before he even took office, during the Hunt administration, while his detractors criticized his support of raising sales taxes multiple times to cover the cost of new state programs.
During his administration, Easley confronted the state legislature on numerous occasions. Easley is the first North Carolina governor to use the power of veto, which voters gave the governor&#x27;s office in 1996. First, in November 2002, Easley vetoed legislation related to unqualified appointments to various boards and commissions. In June 2003, he vetoed a bill that stripped the State Board of Education of its authority to set teacher standards. In August 2003, he vetoed HB 917 which raised fees charged by finance companies. In July 2004, he vetoed HB 429 which would have required local governments to make cash payments to billboard owners of up to five times the annual revenue generated by the billboard upon its removal. In March 2005, he vetoed SB 130 which would have conveyed state property. In September 2005, he vetoed HB 706 which would have affected teacher standards. In August 2007 he vetoed HB 1761, a controversial financial incentives bill which would have awarded up to 40 million dollars to companies within the state. Easley has used his veto power a total of nine times as of 2008. His ninth veto was the first to be overridden by the legislature in North Carolina history.
Easley ran for a second term as governor in 2004. He defeated Rickey Kipfer, his only opponent in the Democratic primary, and faced Republican former state senator Patrick Ballantine and Libertarian Barbara Howe in November 2004. Though the state voted for Republicans George W. Bush for president and Richard Burr as United States Senator, Easley won his second term as governor and Democrats reestablished control over both chambers of the state legislature (the House had been split equally between the two major parties since 2003).

He also supported a controversial statewide lottery, which was ultimately approved on August 31, 2005, after Lieutenant Governor Bev Perdue cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate. He has stated that proceeds from the lottery will be used for much-needed educational programs.
Easley presided over 27 executions, including the 1,000th after the death penalty was reintroduced in the United States in 1976. He, however, granted commutation to two death row inmates. The North Carolina governor has the sole right to commute death sentences imposed by a state court.

Governor Easley declined to run against Elizabeth Dole for her Senate seat in 2008. He was considered to be a possible candidate for U.S. Senate to run against Senator Richard Burr in 2010, but he had strongly denied interest in the race. The &quot;Raleigh News &amp; Observer&quot; speculated in October 2006 that Easley was going to act like a presidential contender in order to position himself for the vice presidential nomination or a cabinet post.

In 2008 in a case that drew international attention, a North Carolina state trooper was filmed hanging and kicking a police dog he was training. After the trooper&#x27;s superiors recommended minor punishment, Easley&#x27;s office recommended that the trooper be fired. The case is ongoing, with the state&#x27;s canine units currently suspended.

As governor, Easley was a member of the National Governors Association, the Southern Governors&#x27; Association, and the Democratic Governors Association. However, he was known for being &quot;reclusive&quot; while in office.

He was succeeded as governor by his Lieutenant Governor, Beverly Perdue, who defeated Charlotte Mayor Pat McCrory in a close race. After leaving office, Easley went to work part-time promoting early college high schools and similar programs for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

==Political positions==
During the 2004 Democratic primaries, he supported North Carolina Senator John Edwards.

In the 2008 campaigns, Easley initially endorsed the presidential candidacy of Senator Hillary Clinton on April 28, 2008. After Senator Barack Obama won the Democratic nomination, Easley endorsed him against Republican nominee John McCain.

==Controversies and campaign finance lawsuit==
Easley was faced with controversies in 2006 stemming from campaign and overseas travel. Easley&#x27;s wife, Mary Easley, took two trips out of the country, one to France and one to Russia and Estonia, for cultural exchanges. Republican critics called the trips overly lavish in a time of economic downturn for the state. However, the director of the North Carolina Museum of Art defended Mary Easley&#x27;s trips as having helped the museum receive loaned art items from The Hermitage in St. Petersburg. Mrs. Easley&#x27;s efforts also resulted in the North Carolina Museum of Art&#x27;s obtaining a collection of Auguste Rodin&#x27;s work valued at $35 million, and in the construction of a new Greek art wing for the museum.

More controversy surfaced months after Easley left office in January 2009. According to Raleigh&#x27;s &quot;News &amp; Observer,&quot; the Federal Bureau of Investigation ordered the North Carolina Highway Patrol to produce all records involving private air travel for Easley and his family. The newspaper reported that Easley may have violated campaign laws.

The North Carolina State Board of Elections opened hearings into Easley&#x27;s conduct on October 26, 2009.

Following a two-year federal and state investigation into campaign finance irregularities, Easley entered an &quot;Alford&quot; plea to a single felony violation of state campaign finance law, accepting responsibility for his campaign&#x27;s failure to report that he took a $1,600 helicopter ride with a supporter in October 2006. While Easley did not admit guilt, he &quot;acknowledged there was sufficient evidence to convict him of a crime.&quot; He pled guilty by entering an &quot;Alford&quot; plea to a single state campaign finance violation. He paid a $1,000 &quot;community penalty.&quot; 
He became the first 
governor of North Carolina to have been convicted of a felony.
Federal officials ended their investigation because of the plea. 
Following the conviction, Easley&#x27;s law license was suspended but formally restored on appeal in January 2013. 
On January 4, 2013, the Senior Resident Superior Court Judge for Wake County granted Easley a Certificate of relief from disabilities. The conviction was later expunged by the Chief Judge of the Superior Court of Wake County. 

== Current activities ==

Easley is a practicing attorney in North Carolina. He represents businesses and corporations and has been involved in several significant civil trials. Politically, in 2018, he joined former North Carolina Governors in successfully opposing state constitutional amendments that would have weakened the powers of the governor. He also joined in the filing of amicus briefs to oppose gerrymandered congressional and legislative districts in North Carolina.

==Personal life==
Easley is a fan of NASCAR. He was involved in a crash at Lowe&#x27;s Motor Speedway near Concord, North Carolina, in 2003. He was behind the wheel of Jimmie Johnson&#x27;s #48 Lowe&#x27;s Chevrolet Monte Carlo, when it hit a retaining wall going 120 mph. He was not seriously injured, since he was wearing a head-and-neck restraint at the time. He is also a fan of the cartoon &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, and while governor, instructed his pollster to separate the state&#x27;s voters into those who watch the show and those who don&#x27;t. Easley reasoned that his constituents ideologies were similar to characters on the show, and would base the explanation of his issues on whether or not the King of the Hill characters would understand them or not.

Easley is also an avid amateur woodworker, and appeared on an episode of &quot;The Woodwright&#x27;s Shop&quot; where he made a walnut table.

<text>The Merrion Centre in Dublin, Ireland is a shopping centre situated at the junction of Nutley Lane with Merrion Road, opposite St. Vincent&#x27;s University Hospital. It serves the community of Dublin 4. It is anchored by the Tesco supermarket and the Japanese embassy is located in the centre.

The centre was once home to one of the last remaining Quinnsworth stores owned by Peter Quinn of Nutley Lane. In the late 1990s, the centre underwent a renovation and a Tesco Ireland store was opened.

A free underground car park is provided, with about a quarter of the spaces reserved for office workers.

The Tony Walsh pharmacy was used in the 2003 film &quot;Intermission&quot;, but filmed to look as if it were outdoors.

<doc id="418820" wikidata="Q275924" url="?curid=418820" title="Mechanical Turk">
<text>The Mechanical Turk, also known as the Automaton Chess Player (, ; ), or simply The Turk, was a fraudulent chess-playing machine constructed in 1770, which appeared to be able to play a strong game of chess against a human opponent. For 84 years, it was exhibited on tours by various owners as an automaton. The machine survived and continued giving occasional exhibitions until 1854, when a fire swept through the museum where it was kept, destroying the machine. Afterwards, articles were published by a son of the machine&#x27;s owner revealing its secrets to the public: that it was an elaborate hoax, suspected by some, but never proven in public while it still existed.

Constructed and unveiled in 1770 by Wolfgang von Kempelen (1734–1804) to impress Empress Maria Theresa of Austria, the mechanism appeared to be able to play a strong game of chess against a human opponent, as well as perform the knight&#x27;s tour, a puzzle that requires the player to move a knight to occupy every square of a chessboard exactly once.

The Turk was in fact a mechanical illusion that allowed a human chess master hiding inside to operate the machine. With a skilled operator, the Turk won most of the games played during its demonstrations around Europe and the Americas for nearly 84 years, playing and defeating many challengers including statesmen such as Napoleon Bonaparte and Benjamin Franklin. The device was later purchased in 1804 and exhibited by Johann Nepomuk Mälzel. The chessmasters who secretly operated it included Johann Allgaier, Boncourt, Aaron Alexandre, William Lewis, Jacques Mouret, and William Schlumberger, but the operators within the mechanism during Kempelen&#x27;s original tour remain unknown.

==Construction==
Kempelen was inspired to build the Turk following his attendance at the court of Maria Theresa of Austria at Schönbrunn Palace, where François Pelletier was performing an illusion act. An exchange afterward resulted in Kempelen promising to return to the Palace with an invention that would top the illusions.

The result of the challenge was the Automaton Chess-player, known in modern times as the Turk. The machine consisted of a life-sized model of a human head and torso, with a black beard and grey eyes, and dressed in Ottoman robes and a turban—&quot;the traditional costume&quot;, according to journalist and author Tom Standage, &quot;of an oriental sorcerer&quot;. Its left arm held a long Ottoman smoking pipe while at rest, while its right lay on the top of a large cabinet that measured about long, wide, and high. Placed on the top of the cabinet was a chessboard, which measured on each side. The front of the cabinet consisted of three doors, an opening, and a drawer, which could be opened to reveal a red and white ivory chess set.

The interior of the machine was very complicated and designed to mislead those who observed it. When opened on the left, the front doors of the cabinet exposed a number of gears and cogs similar to clockwork. The section was designed so that if the back doors of the cabinet were open at the same time one could see through the machine. The other side of the cabinet did not house machinery; instead it contained a red cushion and some removable parts, as well as brass structures. This area was also designed to provide a clear line of vision through the machine. Underneath the robes of the Ottoman model, two other doors were hidden. These also exposed clockwork machinery and provided a similarly unobstructed view through the machine. The design allowed the presenter of the machine to open every available door to the public, to maintain the illusion.

Neither the clockwork visible to the left side of the machine nor the drawer that housed the chess set extended fully to the rear of the cabinet; they instead went only one third of the way. A sliding seat was also installed, allowing the operator inside to slide from place to place and thus evade observation as the presenter opened various doors. The sliding of the seat caused dummy machinery to slide into its place to further conceal the person inside the cabinet.

The chessboard on the top of the cabinet was thin enough to allow for a magnetic linkage. Each piece in the chess set had a small, strong magnet attached to its base, and when they were placed on the board the pieces would attract a magnet attached to a string under their specific places on the board. This allowed the operator inside the machine to see which pieces moved where on the chess board. The bottom of the chessboard had corresponding numbers, 1–64, allowing the operator to see which places on the board were affected by a player&#x27;s move. The internal magnets were positioned in a way that outside magnetic forces did not influence them, and Kempelen would often allow a large magnet to sit at the side of the board in an attempt to show that the machine was not influenced by magnetism.

As a further means of misdirection, the Turk came with a small wooden coffin-like box that the presenter would place on the top of the cabinet. While Johann Nepomuk Mälzel, a later owner of the machine, did not use the box, Kempelen often peered into the box during play, suggesting that the box controlled some aspect of the machine. The box was believed by some to have supernatural power; Karl Gottlieb von Windisch wrote in his 1784 book &quot;Inanimate Reason&quot; that o]ne old lady, in particular, who had not forgotten the tales she had been told in her youth ... went and hid herself in a window seat, as distant as she could from the &quot;evil spirit,&quot; which she firmly believed possessed the machine.&quot;

The interior also contained a pegboard chess board connected to a pantograph-style series of levers that controlled the model&#x27;s left arm. The metal pointer on the pantograph moved over the interior chessboard, and would simultaneously move the arm of the Turk over the chessboard on the cabinet. The range of motion allowed the operator to move the Turk&#x27;s arm up and down, and turning the lever would open and close the Turk&#x27;s hand, allowing it to grasp the pieces on the board. All of this was made visible to the operator by using a simple candle, which had a ventilation system through the model. Other parts of the machinery allowed for a clockwork-type sound to be played when the Turk made a move, further adding to the machinery illusion, and for the Turk to make various facial expressions. A voice box was added following the Turk&#x27;s acquisition by Mälzel, allowing the machine to say (French for &quot;check&quot;) during matches.

An operator inside the machine also had tools to assist in communicating with the presenter outside. Two brass discs equipped with numbers were positioned opposite each other on the inside and outside of the cabinet. A rod could rotate the discs to the desired number, which acted as a code between the two.

==Exhibition==
The Turk made its debut in 1770 at Schönbrunn Palace, about six months after Pelletier&#x27;s act. Kempelen addressed the court, presenting what he had built, and began the demonstration of the machine and its parts. With every showing of the Turk, Kempelen began by opening the doors and drawers of the cabinet, allowing members of the audience to inspect the machine. Following this display, Kempelen would announce that the machine was ready for a challenger.

Kempelen would inform the player that the Turk would use the white pieces and have the first move (note that the convention that White moves first was not yet established, so these were not redundant statements). Between moves the Turk kept its left arm on the cushion. The Turk could nod twice if it threatened its opponent&#x27;s queen, and three times upon placing the king in check. If an opponent made an illegal move, the Turk would shake its head, move the piece back and make its own move, thus forcing a forfeit of its opponent&#x27;s move. Louis Dutens, a traveller who observed a showing of the Turk, attempted to trick the machine &quot;by giving the Queen the move of a Knight, but my mechanic opponent was not to be so imposed upon; he took up my Queen and replaced her in the square from which I had moved her&quot;. Kempelen made it a point to traverse the room during the match, and invited observers to bring magnets, irons, and lodestones to the cabinet to test whether the machine was run by a form of magnetism or weights. The first person to play against the Turk was Count Ludwig von Cobenzl, an Austrian courtier at the palace. Along with other challengers that day, he was quickly defeated, with observers of the match stating that the machine played aggressively, and typically beat its opponents within thirty minutes.

Another part of the machine&#x27;s exhibition was the completion of the knight&#x27;s tour, a famed chess puzzle. The puzzle requires the player to move a knight around a chessboard, touching each square once along the way. While most experienced chess players of the time still struggled with the puzzle, the Turk was capable of completing the tour without any difficulty from any starting point via a pegboard used by the operator with a mapping of the puzzle laid out.

The Turk also had the ability to converse with spectators using a letter board. The operator, whose identity during the period when Kempelen presented the machine at Schönbrunn Palace is unknown, was able to do this in English, French, and German. Carl Friedrich Hindenburg, a university mathematician, kept a record of the conversations during the Turk&#x27;s time in Leipzig and published it in 1789 as (or &quot;On the Chessplayer of Mr. von Kempelen And Its Replica&quot;). Topics of questions put to and answered by the Turk included its age, marital status, and its secret workings.

==Tour of Europe==
Following word of its debut, interest in the machine grew across Europe. Kempelen, however, was more interested in his other projects and avoided exhibiting the Turk, often lying about the machine&#x27;s repair status to prospective challengers. Von Windisch wrote at one point that Kempelen &quot;refused the entreaties of his friends, and a crowd of curious persons from all countries, the satisfaction of seeing this far-famed machine&quot;. In the decade following its debut at Schönbrunn Palace the Turk only played one opponent, Sir Robert Murray Keith, a Scottish noble, and Kempelen went as far as dismantling the Turk entirely following the match. Kempelen was quoted as referring to the invention as a &quot;mere bagatelle&quot;, as he was not pleased with its popularity and would rather continue work on steam engines and machines that replicated human speech.

In 1781, Kempelen was ordered by Emperor Joseph II to reconstruct the Turk and deliver it to Vienna for a state visit from Grand Duke Paul of Russia and his wife. The appearance was so successful that Grand Duke Paul suggested a tour of Europe for the Turk, a request to which Kempelen reluctantly agreed.
The Turk began its European tour in 1783, beginning with an appearance in France in April. A stop at Versailles beginning on 17 April, preceded an exhibition in Paris, where the Turk lost a match to Charles Godefroy de La Tour d&#x27;Auvergne, the Duc de Bouillon. Upon arrival in Paris in May 1783, it was displayed to the public and played a variety of opponents, including a lawyer named Mr. Bernard who was a second rank in chess ability. Following the sessions at Versailles, demands increased for a match with François-André Danican Philidor, who was considered the best chess player of his time. Moving to the Café de la Régence, the machine played many of the most skilled players, often losing (e.g. against Bernard and Verdoni), until securing a match with Philidor at the Académie des Sciences. While Philidor won his match with the Turk, Philidor&#x27;s son noted that his father called it &quot;his most fatiguing game of chess ever!&quot; The Turk&#x27;s final game in Paris was against Benjamin Franklin, who was serving as ambassador to France from the United States. Franklin reportedly enjoyed the game with the Turk and was interested in the machine for the rest of his life, keeping a copy of Philip Thicknesse&#x27;s book &quot;The Speaking Figure and the Automaton Chess Player, Exposed and Detected&quot; in his personal library.

Following his tour of Paris, Kempelen moved the Turk to London, where it was exhibited daily for five shillings. Thicknesse, known in his time as a skeptic, sought out the Turk in an attempt to expose the inner workings of the machine. While he respected Kempelen as &quot;a very ingenious man&quot;, he asserted that the Turk was an elaborate hoax with a small child inside the machine, describing the machine as &quot;a complicated piece of clockwork ... which is nothing more, than one, of many other ingenious devices, to misguide and delude the observers&quot;.

After a year in London, Kempelen and the Turk travelled to Leipzig, stopping in various European cities along the way. From Leipzig, it went to Dresden, where Joseph Friedrich Freiherr von Racknitz viewed the Turk and published his findings in &quot;&quot;, along with illustrations showing his beliefs about how the machine operated. It then moved to Amsterdam, after which Kempelen is said to have accepted an invitation to the Sanssouci palace in Potsdam of Frederick the Great, King of Prussia. The story goes that Frederick enjoyed the Turk so much that he paid a large sum of money to Kempelen in exchange for the Turk&#x27;s secrets. Frederick never gave the secret away, but was reportedly disappointed to learn how the machine worked. This story is apocryphal; there is no evidence of the Turk&#x27;s encounter with Frederick, the first mention of which comes in the early 19th century, by which time the Turk was incorrectly said to have played against George III of Great Britain. It seems most likely that the machine stayed dormant at Schönbrunn Palace for over two decades, although Kempelen attempted unsuccessfully to sell it in his final years. Kempelen died at the age of 70 on 26 March 1804.

==Mälzel and the machine==
Following the death of Kempelen, the Turk remained unexhibited until 1805 when Kempelen&#x27;s son decided to sell it to Johann Nepomuk Mälzel, a Bavarian musician with an interest in various machines and devices. Mälzel, whose successes included patenting a form of metronome, had tried to purchase the Turk once previously, before Kempelen&#x27;s death. The original attempt had failed, owing to Kempelen&#x27;s asking price of 20,000 francs; Kempelen&#x27;s son sold the machine to Mälzel for half this sum.

Upon acquiring the Turk, Mälzel had to learn its secrets and make some repairs to get it back in working order. His stated goal was to make explaining the Turk a greater challenge. While the completion of this goal took ten years, the Turk still made appearances, most notably with Napoleon Bonaparte.

In 1809, Napoleon I of France arrived at Schönbrunn Palace to play the Turk. According to an eyewitness report, Mälzel took responsibility for the construction of the machine while preparing the game, and the Turk (Johann Baptist Allgaier) saluted Napoleon before the start of the match. The details of the match have been published over the years in numerous accounts, many of them contradictory. According to Bradley Ewart, it is believed that the Turk sat at its cabinet, and Napoleon sat at a separate chess table. Napoleon&#x27;s table was in a roped-off area and he was not allowed to cross into the Turk&#x27;s area, with Mälzel crossing back and forth to make each player&#x27;s move and allowing a clear view for the spectators. In a surprise move, Napoleon took the first turn instead of allowing the Turk to make the first move, as was usual; but Mälzel allowed the game to continue. Shortly thereafter, Napoleon attempted an illegal move. Upon noticing the move, the Turk returned the piece to its original spot and continued the game. Napoleon attempted the illegal move a second time, and the Turk responded by removing the piece from the board entirely and taking its turn. Napoleon then attempted the move a third time, the Turk responding with a sweep of its arm, knocking all the pieces off the board. Napoleon was reportedly amused, and then played a real game with the machine, completing nineteen moves before tipping over his king in surrender. Alternate versions of the story include Napoleon being unhappy about losing to the machine, playing the machine at a later time, playing one match with a magnet on the board, and playing a match with a shawl around the head and body of the Turk in an attempt to obscure its vision.

In 1811, Mälzel brought the Turk to Milan for a performance with Eugène de Beauharnais, the Prince of Venice and Viceroy of Italy. Beauharnais enjoyed the machine so much that he offered to purchase it from Mälzel. After some serious bargaining, Beauharnais acquired the Turk for 30,000 francs—three times what Mälzel had paid—and kept it for four years. In 1815, Mälzel returned to Beauharnais in Munich and asked to buy the Turk back. There exist two versions of how much he had to pay, eventually working out an agreement. One version appeared in the French periodical . The complete story does not make a lot of sense since Mälzel visited Paris again, and he also could import his &quot;Conflagration of Moscow&quot;.

Following the repurchase, Mälzel brought the Turk back to Paris, where he made acquaintances of many of the leading chess players at Café de la Régence. Mälzel stayed in France with the machine until 1818, when he moved to London and held a number of performances with the Turk and many of his other machines. In London, Mälzel and his act received a large amount of press, and he continued improving the machine, ultimately installing a voice box so the machine could say when placing a player in check.

In 1819, Mälzel took the Turk on a tour of the United Kingdom. There were several new developments in the act, such as allowing the opponent the first move and eliminating the king&#x27;s bishop&#x27;s pawn from the Turk&#x27;s pieces. This pawn handicap created further interest in the Turk, and spawned a book by W. J. Hunneman chronicling the matches played with this handicap. Despite the handicap, the Turk (operated by Mouret at the time) ended up with forty-five victories, three losses, and two stalemates.

==Mälzel in North America==
The appearances of the Turk were profitable for Mälzel, and he continued by taking it and his other machines to the United States. In 1826, he opened an exhibition in New York City that slowly grew in popularity, giving rise to many newspaper stories and anonymous threats of exposure of the secret. Mälzel&#x27;s problem was finding a proper operator for the machine, having trained an unknown woman in France before coming to the United States. He ended up recalling a former operator, William Schlumberger, from Alsace in Europe to come to America and work for him again once Mälzel was able to provide the money for Schlumberger&#x27;s transport.

Upon Schlumberger&#x27;s arrival, the Turk debuted in Boston, Mälzel spinning a story that the New York chess players could not handle full games and that the Boston players were much better opponents. This was a success for many weeks, and the tour moved to Philadelphia for three months. Following Philadelphia, the Turk moved to Baltimore, where it played for a number of months, including losing a match against Charles Carroll, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. The exhibition in Baltimore brought news that two brothers had constructed their own machine, the Walker Chess-player. Mälzel viewed the competing machine and attempted to buy it, but the offer was declined and the duplicate machine toured for a number of years, never receiving the fame that Mälzel&#x27;s machine did and eventually falling into obscurity.

Mälzel continued with exhibitions around the United States until 1828, when he took some time off and visited Europe, returning in 1829. Throughout the 1830s, he continued to tour the United States, exhibiting the machine as far west as the Mississippi River and visiting Canada. In Richmond, Virginia, the Turk was observed by Edgar Allan Poe, who was writing for the &quot;Southern Literary Messenger&quot;. Poe&#x27;s essay &quot;Maelzel&#x27;s Chess Player&quot; was published in April 1836 and is the most famous essay on the Turk, even though many of Poe&#x27;s hypotheses were incorrect (such as that a chess-playing machine must always win).

Mälzel eventually took the Turk on his second tour to Havana, Cuba. In Cuba, Schlumberger died of yellow fever in February 1838, leaving Mälzel without an operator for his machine. Dejected, Mälzel died at sea in July 1838 at the age of 65 during his return trip, leaving his machinery with the ship captain.

==Final years and beyond==

When the ship on which Mälzel died returned, his various machines, including the Turk, fell into the hands of Mälzel&#x27;s friend, the businessman John Ohl. He attempted to auction off the Turk, but owing to low bidding ultimately bought it himself for $400. (approx. $13,600 in 2024) Only when John Kearsley Mitchell from Philadelphia, Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s personal physician and an admirer of the Turk, approached Ohl did the Turk change hands again. Mitchell formed a restoration club and went about the business of repairing the Turk for public appearances, completing the restoration in 1840.

As interest in the Turk outgrew its location, Mitchell and his club chose to donate the machine to the Philadelphia Museum of Charles Willson Peale, also known as the Chinese Museum. While the Turk still occasionally gave performances, it was eventually relegated to the corners of the museum and forgotten about until 5 July 1854, when a fire that started at the National Theater in Philadelphia reached the Museum and destroyed the Turk. Mitchell&#x27;s son Silas Weir Mitchell believed he had heard &quot;through the struggling flames ... the last words of our departed friend, the sternly whispered, oft repeated syllables, &#x27;echec! echec!!

John Gaughan, an American manufacturer of equipment for magicians based in Los Angeles, spent $120,000 (approx. $369,856 in 2024) building his own version of Kempelen&#x27;s machine over a five-year period from 1984. The machine uses the original chessboard, which was stored separately from the original Turk and was not destroyed in the fire. The first public display of Gaughan&#x27;s Turk was in November 1989 at a history of magic conference. The machine was presented much as Kempelen presented the original, except that the opponent was replaced by a computer running a chess program.

==Revealing the secrets==
While many books and articles were written during the Turk&#x27;s life about how it worked, most were inaccurate, drawing incorrect inferences from external observation.

The first articles on the mechanism were published in a French magazine entitled &quot;Le Magasin pittoresque&quot; in 1834. It was not until Silas Mitchell&#x27;s series of articles for &quot;The Chess Monthly&quot; that the secret was fully revealed. Mitchell, son of the final private owner of the Turk, wrote that &quot;no secret was ever kept as the Turk&#x27;s has been. Guessed at, in part, many times, no one of the several explanations ... ever solved this amusing puzzle&quot;. As the Turk was lost to fire at the time of this publication, Silas Mitchell felt that there were &quot;no longer any reasons for concealing from the amateurs of chess, the solution to this ancient enigma&quot;.

The most important biographical history about the Chess-player and Mälzel was presented in &quot;The Book of the First American Chess Congress&quot;, published by Daniel Willard Fiske in 1857. The account, &quot;The Automaton Chess-Player in America&quot;, was written by Professor George Allen of Philadelphia, in the form of a letter to William Lewis, one of the former operators of the chess automaton.

In 1859, a letter published in the &quot;Philadelphia Sunday Dispatch&quot; by William F. Kummer, who worked as an operator under John Mitchell, revealed another piece of the secret: a candle inside the cabinet, necessary to provide light for the operator. A series of tubes led from the lamp to the turban of the Turk for ventilation. The smoke rising from the turban would be disguised by the smoke coming from the other candelabra in the area where the game was played.

Later in 1859, an uncredited article appeared in &quot;Littell&#x27;s Living Age&quot; that purported to be the story of the Turk from French magician Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin. This was rife with errors ranging from dates of events to a story of a Polish officer whose legs were amputated, but ended up being rescued by Kempelen and smuggled back to Russia inside the machine.

A new article about the Turk did not turn up until 1899, when &quot;The American Chess Magazine&quot; published an account of the Turk&#x27;s match with Napoleon Bonaparte. The story was basically a review of previous accounts, and a substantive published account would not appear until 1947, when &quot;Chess Review&quot; published articles by Kenneth Harkness and Jack Straley Battell that amounted to a comprehensive history and description of the Turk, complete with new diagrams that synthesized information from previous publications. Another article written in 1960 for &quot;American Heritage&quot; by Ernest Wittenberg provided new diagrams describing how the operator sat inside the cabinet.

In Henry A. Davidson&#x27;s 1945 publication &quot;A Short History of Chess&quot;, significant weight is given to Poe&#x27;s essay which erroneously suggested that the player sat inside the Turk figure, rather than on a moving seat inside the cabinet. A similar error would occur in Alex G. Bell&#x27;s 1978 book &quot;The Machine Plays Chess&quot;, which falsely asserted that &quot;the operator was a trained boy (or very small adult) who followed the directions of the chess player who was hidden elsewhere on stage or in the theater...&quot;

More books were published about the Turk toward the end of the 20th century. Along with Bell&#x27;s book, Charles Michael Carroll&#x27;s &quot;The Great Chess Automaton&quot; (1975) focused more on the studies of the Turk. Bradley Ewart&#x27;s &quot;Chess: Man vs. Machine&quot; (1980) discussed the Turk as well as other purported chess-playing automatons.

It was not until the creation of Deep Blue, IBM&#x27;s attempt at a computer that could challenge the world&#x27;s best players, that interest increased again, and two more books were published: Gerald M. Levitt&#x27;s &quot;The Turk, Chess Automaton&quot; (2000), and Tom Standage&#x27;s &quot;The Turk: The Life and Times of the Famous Eighteenth-Century Chess-Playing Machine&quot;, published in 2002. The Turk was used as a personification of Deep Blue in the 2003 documentary &quot;Game Over: Kasparov and the Machine&quot;.

==Legacy and popular culture==

Owing to the Turk&#x27;s popularity and mystery, its construction inspired a number of inventions and imitations, including Ajeeb, or &quot;The Egyptian&quot;, an American imitation built by Charles Hopper that President Grover Cleveland played in 1885, and Mephisto, the self-described &quot;most famous&quot; machine, of which little is known. The first imitation was made while Mälzel was in Baltimore. Created by the Brothers Walker, the &quot;American Chess Player&quot; made its debut in May 1827 in New York. El Ajedrecista was built in 1912 by Leonardo Torres Quevedo as a chess-playing automaton and made its public debut during the Paris World Fair of 1914. Capable of playing rook and king versus king endgames using electromagnets, it was the first true chess-playing automaton, and a precursor of sorts to Deep Blue.

The Turk was visited in London by Rev. Edmund Cartwright in 1784. He was so intrigued by the Turk that he would later question whether &quot;it is more difficult to construct a machine that shall weave than one which shall make all the variety of moves required in that complicated game&quot;. Cartwright would patent the prototype for a power loom within the year. Sir Charles Wheatstone, an inventor, saw a later appearance of the Turk while it was owned by Mälzel. He also saw some of Mälzel&#x27;s speaking machines, and Mälzel later presented a demonstration of the speaking machines to the researcher and his teenage son. Alexander Graham Bell obtained a copy of a book by Wolfgang von Kempelen on speaking machines after being inspired by seeing a similar machine built by Wheatstone; Bell went on to file the first successful patent for the telephone.

A play, &quot;The Automaton Chess Player&quot;, was presented in New York City in 1845. The advertising, as well as an article that appeared in &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot;, claimed that the play featured Kempelen&#x27;s Turk, but it was in fact a copy of the Turk created by J. Walker, who had earlier presented the Walker Chess-player.

Raymond Bernard&#x27;s silent feature film &quot;The Chess Player&quot; (1927) weaves elements from the real story of the Turk into an adventure tale set in the aftermath of the first of the Partitions of Poland in 1772. The film&#x27;s &quot;Baron von Kempelen&quot; helps a dashing young Polish nationalist on the run from the occupying Russians, who also happens to be an expert chess player, by hiding him inside a chess playing automaton called the Turk, closely based on the real Kempelen model. Just as they are about to escape over the border, the Baron is summoned to Saint Petersburg to present the Turk to the empress Catherine II. In an echo of the Napoleon incident, Catherine attempts to cheat the Turk, who wipes all the pieces from the board in response.

The Turk has also inspired works of literary fiction. In 1849, just a few years before the Turk was destroyed, Edgar Allan Poe published a tale &quot;Von Kempelen and His Discovery&quot;. Ambrose Bierce&#x27;s short story &quot;Moxon&#x27;s Master&quot;, published in 1909, is a morbid tale about a chess-playing automaton that resembles the Turk. In 1938, John Dickson Carr published &quot;The Crooked Hinge&quot;, a locked-room mystery in his line of Dr. Gideon Fell detective novels. Among the puzzles presented included an automaton that operates in a way that is unexplainable to the characters. Gene Wolfe&#x27;s 1977 science fiction short story &quot;The Marvellous Brass Chessplaying Automaton&quot; also features a device very similar to the Turk. Robert Loehr&#x27;s 2007 novel &quot;The Chess Machine&quot; (published in the UK as &quot;The Secrets of the Chess Machine&quot;) focuses on the man inside the machine. F. Gwynplaine MacIntyre&#x27;s 2007 story &quot;The Clockwork Horror&quot; reconstructs Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s original encounter with Mälzel&#x27;s chess-player, and also establishes (from contemporary advertisements in a Richmond newspaper) precisely when and where this encounter took place. Jingetsu Isomi&#x27;s 2013 manga series &quot;Chrono Monochrome&quot; is about a 21st-century Japanese child chess prodigy who travels back in time and becomes the Turk&#x27;s original operator. In 2023, the story &quot;Alone Together&quot; from the &quot;Tales from the Pizzaplex&quot; book series, itself a part of the &quot;Five Nights at Freddy&#x27;s&quot; franchise, features a Mechanical Turk as a school project.

Walter Benjamin alludes to the Mechanical Turk in the first thesis of his &quot;Theses on the Philosophy of History&quot; (), written in 1940.

The Mechanical Turk appears as part of a ritual for the Stranger, an entity that manifests via the uncanny valley, in episode 116, &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;, of the British horror podcast &quot;The Magnus Archives&quot;.

In the sci-fi TV series &quot;&quot; an artificial intelligence chess-playing computer called &quot;The Turk&quot; is an important part of the plot.

In 2005, Amazon launched Amazon Mechanical Turk, the name for which was inspired by The Mechanical Turk. Amazon Mechanical Turk is an online service uses remote human labor hidden behind a computer interface to help employers perform tasks that are not possible using a true machine, roughly analogous to the original Mechanical Turk.

In June 2024, chess.com announced that one of the monthly bots would be The Mechanical Turk. It was given a rating of &quot;?&quot; with the description: &quot;Created in 1770, The Mechanical Turk was the first ever chess robot. But why do we hear sneezes from his stomach? Play him and see if you can unravel this month&#x27;s secret...&quot;

<doc id="418822" wikidata="Q5527268" url="?curid=418822" title="Gateway National Recreation Area">
<text>Gateway National Recreation Area is a U.S. National Recreation Area in New York City and Monmouth County, New Jersey. It provides recreational opportunities that are not commonly found in a dense urban environment, including ocean swimming, bird watching, boating, hiking and camping. More than 8.7 million people visited Gateway National Recreation Area in 2022, making it the fourth-most visited unit of the National Park Service.

Gateway was created by the U.S. Congress in 1972 to preserve and protect scarce or unique natural, cultural, and recreational resources with relatively convenient access by a high percentage of the nation&#x27;s population. It is owned by the federal government and managed by the National Park Service.

Gateway is distinct from other national park units due to its lack of natural buffer zones and that it faces constant environmental changes driven by human activity. The lands and waters of Gateway represent some of the last remnants of the original shoreline. In 2001, the Jamaica Bay and Staten Island Units in New York drew more than 6 million visitors, while the Sandy Hook Unit in New Jersey attracted over 1 million.

== Creation ==
In 1969, the Regional Plan Association proposed a new national seashore in the New York metropolitan area, to be administered by the United States Department of the Interior. U.S. President Richard Nixon put his support behind a very similar proposal in 1970, with one significant change: instead of being designated a &quot;seashore&quot;, the protected area would be a national park. In May of that year, the president started the process of getting Congressional approval for this move.

The United States House of Representatives approved the creation of Gateway National Recreation Area in September 1972, and most of the land was transferred to the National Park Service (NPS) for inclusion in Gateway National Recreation Area. In the same vote, the House denied the state&#x27;s provision to create a housing development at Floyd Bennett Field, which was to be part of the Gateway Area. Gateway National Recreation Area was officially created on October 27, 1972, along with Golden Gate National Recreation Area in San Francisco. Gateway included over of land. This excluded some of the land proposed by the RPA, including the Coney Island shore.

== Units and park sites ==
The recreation area comprises three units and 11 park sites in all. Primary law enforcement in the Gateway National Recreation Area is the responsibility of the United States Park Police in the New York units, and National Park Service Rangers in the New Jersey unit.

=== Jamaica Bay Unit ===
Jamaica Bay Unit, in Brooklyn and Queens, includes much of the shoreline and water below the Shore Parkway beginning at Plum Beach and ending at John F. Kennedy International Airport, along with several dozen islands in Jamaica Bay, a tidal estuary. The Jamaica Bay Unit is the largest of the three units.It also includes most of the western part of the Rockaway Peninsula, which separates Jamaica Bay from the Atlantic Ocean. Among the sites in this unit are:
*Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge is a prime location for viewing birds and bird migrations, diamondback turtle egg-laying and horseshoe crab mating and egg laying. Its are mostly open water, but includes upland shoreline and islands with salt marsh, dunes, brackish ponds, woodland, and fields. It is the only &quot;wildlife refuge&quot; in the National Park System. Originally created and managed by New York City as a &quot;wildlife refuge&quot;, the term was retained by Gateway when the site was transferred. All other federally managed areas titled &quot;wildlife refuge&quot; are managed by the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service under their own specific criteria and standards.
* Shirley Chisholm State Park is a park built on top of the former Pennsylvania Ave landfill along the belt parkway in the north of the bay. The park is operated by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, but the land is owned by the National Park Service and is leased to the state for a 60-year period. The park represents an innovative step in landfill remediation and redevelopment, and has cost $20 million as of 2019 to develop. The park features bike paths, free bike rentals, kayaking, fishing, and walking trails. The first phase of the park was opened in July 2019, and the second half was completed in 2021.
* Floyd Bennett Field, a decommissioned airfield with a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places, also hosts the Historic Aircraft Restoration Project (H.A.R.P.) in Hangar B where volunteers are working to preserve the park&#x27;s collection of historic aircraft. Hangar B is open to the public at selected times during the week. Exhibits and programs on the airfield&#x27;s history are available in the former control tower and terminal, since converted into the Ryan Visitor Center, named for William Fitts Ryan, the congressman who championed Gateway&#x27;s creation. The former airfield also accommodates public camping, with 46 campsites. As of August 2013, Floyd Bennett Field campground provides hot showers and clean modern bathrooms. There is also a camp store. No electricity provided. Still, it is the only public campground maintained by the National Park Service that is within the limits of an American city, and the only legal campground in New York City. The grasslands of Floyd Bennett Field are a good place for viewing falcons such as kestrels. Floyd Bennett Field also includes concession recreational facilities including a sports arena and ice skating rinks in adaptively re-used hangars. Within this unit, but still nearby, are Dead Horse Bay, which includes a marina concession, and an adjacent golf driving range concession. Bergen Beach, on the north shore of Jamaica Bay, is also nearby and within the unit&#x27;s boundary, supporting a horse riding academy concession.
* Canarsie Pier is the latest in a series of recreational piers near this location, and remains popular as a picnic area and fishing spot on the north shore of the bay.
* Fort Tilden, between Jacob Riis Park and Breezy Point on the Rockaway peninsula, has some of the city&#x27;s most pristine and secluded ocean beaches, a successional maritime forest, a coastal dune system, and a freshwater pond. Between 1917 and 1974, Fort Tilden served as part of the harbor&#x27;s system of defenses, and once housed Nike antiaircraft missiles. Today an observatory deck on one of the old batteries has views of Jamaica Bay, New York Harbor and the Manhattan skyline. Fort Tilden is one of the best places on New York Harbor to observe hawks during the fall migration.
* Breezy Point Tip occupies the westernmost part of the Rockaway peninsula, forming one side of the outer &quot;gateway&quot; to New York Harbor. Its contain oceanfront beach, bay shoreline, dunes, marshes and coastal grasslands. Breezy Point Tip is a nesting area for the threatened piping plover.
* Jacob Riis Park is an ocean beach with a boardwalk and historic bathhouse with art deco elements. It was built by powerful New York planner and administrator Robert Moses, and was named after journalist, photographer and reformer Jacob Riis.
=== Staten Island Unit ===

The Staten Island Unit is located on the southeastern shore of Staten Island facing Lower New York Bay. It includes Hoffman and Swinburne Islands, both off limits to visitation and managed primarily for the benefit of avian species. The unit also includes the following three sites:
* Fort Wadsworth is a historic collection of masonry fortifications on the site of much earlier fortifications at the Narrows of New York Bay. It is one of the oldest military bases in the United States, having been established in 1663. At the time of Gateway&#x27;s establishment in 1972, Fort Wadsworth was under the authority of the U.S. Army, and was turned over to the U.S. Navy in 1979. It officially ended its operations as a military base in 1993, and was placed under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service in 1995. Some noteworthy historical structures are Fort Tompkins, Battery Weed, and Mont Sec Avenue (Officers&#x27; Row). There are a variety of recreational activities available at this site, including biking, camping, bird watching, and kite flying.
* Miller Field is a historic former airfield south of New Dorp with picnic areas, open areas and sports fields.
* Great Kills Park includes a marina where visitors can go boating, a beach with lifeguards during the summer, and nature trails. It also serves as a nesting site for osprey.
As for Hoffman and Swinburne Islands, both are artificially constructed islands originally established in the late 19th century as quarantine centers for arriving immigrants at Ellis Island who were suspected to be carrying illnesses. Swinburne Island is the smaller of the two, at 4 acres, whereas Hoffman Island is 11 acres. Both islands are no longer publicly accessible, and now serve primarily as nesting sites for a variety of bird species. Harbor seals have also been spotted on Hoffman and Swinburne Islands during the winter season.

=== Sandy Hook Unit===
Sandy Hook Unit is in Monmouth County in northern New Jersey. The Sandy Hook Unit covers roughly 1,665 acres of land, including 7.5 miles of ocean beaches, sheltered bayside coves, and hundreds of acres of ecologically important barrier beach vegetation. The area is home to ocean beaches, Sandy Hook Bay, salt marshes, the historic Fort Hancock, and the Sandy Hook Lighthouse. At the northern end of the unit lies the Fort Hancock complex, with hiking trails that wind through dunes, ponds, and some of the most valuable bird habitats in New Jersey. The barrier peninsula forms the other side of the &quot;gateway&quot; to New York Harbor, and includes two park sites:
* Fort Hancock served as part of the harbor&#x27;s coastal defense system from 1895 until 1974 and contains 100 historic buildings and fortifications.
* Sandy Hook contains seven beaches, including Gunnison Beach, a nude beach by custom, as well as salt marshes and a maritime holly forest. Ferries from Manhattan are available in season. Fishing and using hand-launched vessels are popular here.
* The Maritime Holly Forest, the largest holly forest in the Northeastern United States, is located in the Sandy Hook unit.

== Animal wildlife ==

The recreation area is home to a variety of species of the main biological classes, including amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles, crustaceans, and insects. The species inhabiting these areas have all been able to habituate to the built environments of New York City and New Jersey. The following species can be found throughout all of the different units of the recreation area:

* Amphibians: Eastern Gray Tree Frog.
* Birds: There are over 325 bird species that can be found throughout Gateway National Recreation Area, which provides a good opportunity for bird watching in New York City. Some of the bird species found throughout the area are the American Oystercatcher, Piping Plovers, Osprey, Tree Swallows, American Woodcock, and Killdeer.
* Crustaceans: Atlantic Horseshoe Crab.
* Insects: Monarch Butterfly, Eastern Tent Caterpillar.
* Mammals: Foxes, Harbor Seals, Raccoons, White-Tailed Deer, Muskrat.
* Reptiles: These cold-blooded species are more likely to be seen in the warmer months, when they are more active. Diamondback Terrapins, Eastern Box Turtle, Painted Turtle, Snapping Turtle

== Environmental assessment ==
As the recreation area has locations throughout New York City and New Jersey, there are a variety of factors to be considered in terms of the effects of the surrounding urban environment on the park ecosystem.

* The National Park Service (NPS) conducts a yearly air quality survey, which assesses the overall air quality, visibility, and ground ozone levels in the recreation area.
* Due to the proximity of the recreation area to the surrounding built environment, there do exist interactions between wildlife and the human environment. The white-tailed deer population can be found in the Staten Island unit of Gateway. Individuals are cautioned to drive with particular attention at times when deer are most active: dawn, dusk, and during the autumn mating season. Deer can wander into road space and increase the risk of collisions.
* After the discovery of radioactive contamination in Great Kills Park in 2005, public access to parts of the park has been restricted while the NPS takes action to investigate the causes of the contamination and conduct a clean-up of the site. The National Park Service is granted authority by CERCLA to take action against any contamination on grounds under their jurisdiction. The investigation and cleanup effort at Great Kills Park follows the phases outlined by CERCLA.
* Current issues with park soil and geology include the extensive use of artificial material to fill in marshes for development. Some of these artificial soils such as those in Jamaica Bay reduced infiltration to hardened trails and roads. Several of the Gateway sites have been constructed in the early to mid-20th century, during which time the use of artificial fill or waste fill was a common method of filling in wetlands, leveling ground elevation, and increasing the usable land area of parks.
* Water resources: Hydrology in the surrounding marine environments including that of Jamaica Bay has been altered by deep dredging and other engineering modifications.
* Vegetation: Gateway conducts invasive species removal and native species planting at several park sites, which supports native plant growth and promotes biodiversity.

== Preservation of natural features ==
Part of Gateway&#x27;s mission is to preserve and restore the unique natural features of New York and New Jersey. These are some recent and ongoing restoration projects at Gateway:

* Marsh Restoration - One aim of this project is to bring in native plant life in an attempt to restore what was lost from erosion as well as removing unsuitable fill to restore proper elevations for salt marshes.
* Crooke&#x27;s Point Restoration - The aim of this project was to reduce the presence of invasive plant species while reintroducing some native species in order to restore the fauna that is native to the Atlantic coastal environment. The goal of this is to provide suitable food and nesting options for native animal species.
* Great Kills Environmental Cleanup - removal of radioactive contamination.
* Spring Creek Environmental Cleanup
* South Shore of Staten Island Coastal Storm Risk Management Project - focuses on recommendations for flood prevention along the South Shore of Staten Island. Some project suggestions include the construction of a vertical flood wall and a buried seawall.

== Preserving Gateway’s heritage ==
There are approximately 800 historic buildings, structures and sites that Gateway posses. It is challenging to maintain these historic buildings due to current conditions and resources numbers as well as funding. Many of these historic buildings were already in poor condition since Gateway was established in 1972.

<text>The Puerto Rican Independence Party (, PIP) is a social-democratic political party in Puerto Rico that campaigns for the independence of Puerto Rico from the United States.

Those who follow the PIP ideology are usually called &quot;independentistas&quot;, &quot;pipiolos&quot; or &quot;pro-independence activists&quot;.

==History==
The party began as the electoral wing of the Puerto Rican independence movement. It is the largest of the independence parties, and the only one that is on the ballot during elections (other candidates must be added in by hand). In 1948, two years after being founded, the PIP gathered 10.2% of the votes in the island. In 1952, two years after an armed uprising of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, it obtained 19% of the votes, its highest electoral support ever, which made it the second electoral party on the island for a moment. In 1956 it took 12.4% of the votes; in 1960 3.1%; in 1964, 4%; in 1968, 3.5; in 1972, 5.4; in 1976, 5.7; in 1980, 5.4; in 1984, 3.6, and in 1988, 5.5. In 2004 it obtained 2.7% of the votes, and in 2008 it took 2%.

===Foundation===
The party was founded on 27 October 1946, by Gilberto Concepción de Gracia (1909–1968), his colleague Fernando Milán Suárez and Antonio J. González. They felt the independence movement had been betrayed by the Popular Democratic Party, whose ultimate goal had originally been independence.

===FBI surveillance of the party===
Former FBI Director Louis Freeh admitted 2003 in a congressional budget hearing that the FBI had engaged in suppression of Puerto Rican independence groups from the 1930s to the 1990s, including surveillance of the 
Puerto Rican Independence Party. The actions undertaken by the FBI have been described as &quot;egregious illegal action, maybe criminal action.&quot;

After Freeh&#x27;s public admission, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported the following details about actions against the Puerto Rican Independence Party:

The FBI&#x27;s surveillance of persons and organizations advocating Puerto Rico&#x27;s independence, was not only recognized by the FBI&#x27;s top leadership, but was also detailed in 1.8 million documents, a fraction of which were released in 2000.

The political repression of the party and the independence movement at large by the U.S. Federal Government between the years 1930 and 1975, coupled with an absorption of some cultural-nationalist ideology by the &quot;populares&quot; in the years thereafter have been identified as major reasons for the electoral decline of the party leading to its loss of official status in 2008.

===1970s===
In 1971, the PIP gubernatorial candidate, Rubén Berríos led a protest against the US Navy in Culebra. During the 1972 elections, the PIP showed the largest growth in its history while running a democratic socialist, pro-worker, pro-poor campaign. One year later, during a delegate assembly, Rubén Berríos declared that the party was not presenting a Marxist–Leninist platform and took the matter to the PIP&#x27;s assembly which voted in favor of the party&#x27;s current stance in favor of social democracy. The Marxist–Leninist faction, called the &quot;terceristas&quot;, split into several groups. The biggest of them went into the Popular Socialist Movement, while the rest went into the Puerto Rican Socialist Party.

===1990s===
In 1999, PIP leaders, especially Rubén Berríos, became involved in the Navy-Vieques protests started by many citizens of Vieques against the presence of the US military in the island-municipality (&quot;see also:&quot; Cause of Vieques).

===2008 election===
During the 2008 elections, the PIP lost official recognition for the second time, obtaining 2.04% of the gubernatorial vote. Loss of recognition was official on 2 January 2009. The minimum vote percentage to keep official recognition is 3.0% as per the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico law. The party also lost both of its seats in the legislature, where they had had one seat in each house.

In May 2009, the party submitted more than 100,000 signed petitions to the Puerto Rico&#x27;s elections commission and regained legal status.

===2012 election===
During the 2012 elections, the PIP lost official recognition for the third time, obtaining 2.5% of the gubernatorial vote. Loss of recognition will be official on 2 January 2013. The minimum vote percentage to keep official recognition is 3.0% as per the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico law.

===2016 election===
For the 2016 election, Senator María de Lourdes Santiago was the party&#x27;s nominee. She obtained 33,452 votes and came in fifth place, with 2.1% of the vote. Some of the senator&#x27;s main policies for the election are outlined below

* Increase the basic teacher&#x27;s salary to $3,000 per month.
* Universal healthcare through the National Health Plan.
* Merge the House of Representatives and the Senate into one unicameral chamber, whereby the members are elected by proportional representation.
* Change the status of Puerto Rico to that of a Freely Associated State.

===2020 election===
For the 2020 election, Juan Dalmau was the party&#x27;s nominee. He obtained 175,402 votes and came in fourth place, with a historic 13.58% of the vote, the second-best electoral performance in PIP history. With the Movimiento Victoria Ciudadana (Citizens&#x27; Victory Movement) obtaining 179,265 votes and coming in third place with 13.95% of the vote, this has been the largest share of the Puerto Rican vote (27.53%) ever gained by left-wing parties in Puerto Rico.
===2024 election===
Juan Dalmau is on the list of candidates for the general elections of November 5, 2024. PIP formed an alliance with Movimiento Victoria Ciudadana called Alianza de País.

Puerto Rican Independence Party also filed a petition before the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico against the holding of the non-binding referendum on the status of Puerto Rico, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico accepted this petition on July 16, the Supreme Court&#x27;s resolution, gives a &quot;non-extendable deadline&quot; of 15 days to the requesting party to present its argument. After this deadline, the defendant will have 15 days to present its arguments. On August 22, 2024, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court dismissed the petition, allowing for the referendum to proceed on on November 5, 2024.

==International support==
The PIP cause receives moral support by international organizations. Examples of these are the Socialist International (the largest organization of political parties in the world), including fifteen political parties which are in power in Latin America. The government of Cuba also supports it, as well as the ex-president of Panama, Martín Torrijos, and a wide group of world-recognized writers and artists.

On 26 January 2007, the Nobel Prize laureate Gabriel García Márquez joined other figures such as Mario Benedetti, Ernesto Sábato, Thiago de Mello, Eduardo Galeano, Carlos Monsiváis, Pablo Armando Fernández, Jorge Enrique Adoum, Pablo Milanés, Luis Rafael Sánchez, Mayra Montero and Ana Lydia Vega, in supporting independence for Puerto Rico and joining the Latin American and Caribbean Congress in Solidarity with Puerto Rico&#x27;s Independence, which approved a resolution favoring the island&#x27;s right to assert its independence, as ratified unanimously by political parties hailing from 22 countries in November 2006. García Márquez&#x27;s push for the recognition of Puerto Rico&#x27;s independence was obtained at the behest of the Puerto Rican Independence Party. His pledge for support to the Puerto Rican Independence Movement was part of a wider effort that emerged from the Latin American and Caribbean Congress in Solidarity with Puerto Rico&#x27;s Independence.

On 18 June 2021 the United Nations associated Special Committee on Decolonization published a draft resolution calling on the United States to facilitate a process that enables the people of Puerto Rico to exercise their right to self-determination and independence. Juan Dalmau spoke before the committee to represent the party stating that the colonial experience of the United States in Puerto Rico had failed and its harmful consequences were still visible.

The Puerto Rican Independence Party has a overseas wing in the USA called &quot;Diáspora PIP&quot;, it is based in New York, Miami, Chicago, New Jersey, San Francisco, Portland, Connecticut and Seattle.

As reported in numerous media, the PIP&#x27;s leadership and active members participated in anti-war protests and mobilization to resist the Iraq War and oppose the U.S. government&#x27;s efforts to encourage Puerto Ricans to enlist in the U.S. Armed Forces. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote in August 2007 that &quot;on this island with a long tradition of military service, pro-independence advocates are tapping the territory&#x27;s growing anti-Iraq war sentiment to revitalize their cause. As a result, 57 percent of Puerto Rico&#x27;s 10th-, 11th- and 12th-graders, or their parents, have signed forms over the past year withholding contact information from the Pentagon. ... For five years, PIP has issued opt-out forms to about 120,000 students in Puerto Rico and encouraged them to sign—and independista activists expect this year to mark their most successful effort yet.&quot; The article also quoted Juan Dalmau, then-secretary general of the Puerto Rican Independence Party as saying: &quot;if the death of a Puerto Rican soldier is tragic, it&#x27;s more tragic if that soldier has no say in that war [with Iraq]&quot; and that he did not want the children of Puerto Rico to become &quot;colonial cannon meat.&quot;

Another article in &quot;The Progressive&quot; also reported on PIP&#x27;s anti-war activity. It was written three years earlier, in 2004, but it still noted that &quot;some groups like the Puerto Rico Bar Association and the Independence Party have registered strong protests against the deployments. In an attempt to draw attention to Puerto Ricans&#x27; lack of elected representatives, even the usually pro-U.S. statehood party has raised concerns about the disproportionate body count suffered by islanders.&quot; Two years later, it was reported that PIP, along with hundreds of other supporters of Puerto Rican independence &quot;blocked the entrance to the U.S. Federal Courthouse here on Feb. 20 to denounce recent FBI raids against the homes and workplaces of ... supporters of Puerto Rican independence ... and the growing repression by the FBI against the independence movement in general.&quot; This demonstration reportedly marked the beginning of PIP &quot;campaign to get the FBI out of Puerto Rico.&quot;

===PIP stance on Puerto Rico&#x27;s economic crisis and taxation system===
During the 2005–2007 Puerto Rico economic crisis, the Puerto Rican Independence Party submitted various bills that would have taxed corporations making $1 million or more in annual net profits an extra ten percent above the average tax rate these corporations pay, which hovers around 5%. The PNP and the PPD parties amended the bill, taxing the corporations the traditional lower rate. Despite objections presented by the PIP, the PNP and PPD also allowed the companies to claim the additional tax as a credit on next year&#x27;s bill, making the &quot;tax&quot;, in effect, a one-year loan. Puerto Rico has been said &quot;There is no place in the territorial limits of the United States that provides such an advantageous base for exporters. &quot; Because of this, many US companies moved their headquarters and manufacturing facilities there. This is why the PNP and PPD believed the tax increase would exacerbate the problems

===Disfranchisement due to residence in Puerto Rico===
United States citizens residing in the U.S. commonwealth of Puerto Rico do not hold the right to vote in U.S. presidential elections. Although Puerto Rico residents elect a Resident Commissioner to the United States House of Representatives, that official may not participate in votes determining the final passage of legislation. Furthermore, Puerto Rico holds no representation of any kind in the United States Senate.

Both the Puerto Rican Independence Party and the New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico officially oppose the island&#x27;s political status quo and consider Puerto Rico&#x27;s lack of federal representation to be disfranchisement. The remaining political organization, the Popular Democratic Party, is less active in its opposition of this case of disfranchisement but has officially stated that it favors fixing the remaining &quot;deficits of democracy&quot; that the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations have publicly recognized in writing through Presidential Task Force Reports.

==Party symbol==

The flag&#x27;s green color stands for the hope of becoming free, and the white cross stands for the sacrifice and commitment of the party with democracy. The flag&#x27;s design is based on the first national flag ever flown by Puerto Ricans, which is also the current flag of the municipality of Lares, location where the first relatively successful attempt of revolutionary insurgency in Puerto Rico, called Grito de Lares, took place on 23 September 1868. The Lares flag is, on the other hand, similar to that of the Dominican Republic, since the Grito&#x27;s mastermind, Ramón Emeterio Betances, not only admired the Dominican pro-independence struggle, but was also half-Dominican himself. The party&#x27;s flag is based on the Nordic Cross flag design (specifically, the proportions used on the Swedish flag). Nordic Cross flags, or Latin cross flags, are a common design in Scandinavia and other parts of the world, and in theory, the PIP&#x27;s emblem belongs to this family of flags.

<text>Joseph Warren Matthews (1812August 27, 1862) was an American politician who served as Governor of Mississippi from 1848 to 1850.

==Biography==
Matthews was born near Huntsville, Alabama. During early adulthood, he came to Mississippi as a government surveyor, engaged in laying out the newly purchased Indian lands. Soon after the Chickasaw purchase, he relocated to Marshall County Mississippi, near the now extinct town of Salem, to become a farmer. His plantation, which contained about actually touched the western boundary of the Chickasaw Cession. The southeast corner of Matthews&#x27; plantation is the northwest corner of the modern Village of Snow Lake. Although Matthews lived in Holly Springs in Marshall County, his plantation was located to the east, in what was then Tippah County. This portion of Tippah County was split to form a new county, Benton County.

In 1840, he was elected representative to the legislature from Marshall County, and was senator from that county from 1844 to 1848. On June 7, 1847 the Democratic State Convention nominated Matthews for governor on the third ballot by a majority of fifty-one of twenty-seven for the other candidates. Matthews won the 1847 gubernatorial election over the Whig candidate, Major A.H. Bradford, also of Marshall County, by a vote of 26,985 to 13,997.

Mathews was a plain-spoken man, and was derided by the aristocratic Whigs for his humble beginnings. A surveyor, he worked for a time as a young man as a well digger, thus earning him the derisive nickname, &quot;Old Copperas Britches.&quot;

During his administration, the state adopted a new legal code, established an institution for the blind, and the University of Mississippi opened for its first session in the fall of 1848. The Jackson-Brandon railroad also began operation, and telegraph service became available in Jackson and other parts of the state.

In 1862, Matthews accepted a commission in the Confederate army, but died in transit at Palmetto, Georgia. There is a large monument to Matthews located in the Matthews family cemetery on his former plantation. This monument is in a wooded area approximately due north from the intersection of Hoover Road and Bonds Loop, and is not visible from the road. It was placed by the Sons of Confederate Veterans.

<doc id="418835" wikidata="Q7504032" url="?curid=418835" title="Shrine Bowl">
<text>The Shrine Bowl was a postseason college football bowl game. The first game was played on December 18, 1948, at War Memorial Stadium in Little Rock, Arkansas, between Hardin–Simmons University and Ouachita Baptist College. The 1949 edition was held in Carbondale, Illinois, as the Indiana State Sycamores faced the Southern Illinois Salukis.

==Game result==
A series of games sponsored by the Shriners as a charity event in Honolulu in December 1941 and referred to by some as the Shrine Bowl was interrupted by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The Willamette University Bearcats and the San Jose State University Spartans travelled to Hawaii to play against each other and the University of Hawaii Rainbow Warriors. The Willamette team lost to the Hawaiians in the opening game on Saturday, December 6, but other games were cancelled when the U.S. Navy base at Pearl Harbor was attacked on December 7, 1941. The teams were among the first civilians evacuated in a convoy to San Francisco a couple of weeks later.
