<text>Flip-flops are a type of light sandal-like shoe, typically worn as a form of casual footwear. They consist of a flat sole held loosely on the foot by a Y-shaped strap known as a toe thong that passes between the first and second toes and around both sides of the foot. This style of footwear has been worn by people of many cultures throughout the world, originating as early as the ancient Egyptians in 1500 BC. In the United States the modern flip-flop may have had its design taken from the traditional Japanese &quot;zōri&quot; after World War II, as soldiers brought them back from Japan.

Flip-flops became a prominent unisex summer footwear starting in the 1960s.

==Etymology and other names==

The term &quot;flip-flop&quot; has been used in American and British English since the 1960s to describe inexpensive footwear consisting of a flat base, typically rubber, and a strap with three anchor points: between the big and second toes, then bifurcating to anchor on both sides of the foot. &quot;Flip-flop&quot; may be an onomatopoeia of the sound made by the sandals when walking in them.

Flip-flops are also called &quot;thongs&quot; (sometimes &quot;pluggers&quot;, &quot;single-&quot; or &quot;double-&quot; depending on construction) in Australia, &quot;jandals&quot; (originally a trademarked name derived from &quot;Japanese sandals&quot;) in New Zealand, and &quot;slops&quot; or &quot;plakkies&quot; in South Africa and Zimbabwe.

In the Philippines, they are called &quot;tsinelas&quot;.

In India, they are called &quot;chappals&quot;, (which traditionally referred to leather slippers). This is hypothesized to have come from the Telugu word &quot;ceppu&quot; (చెప్పు), from Proto-Dravidian *keruppu, meaning &quot;sandal&quot;.

In some parts of Latin America, flip-flops are called &quot;chanclas&quot;. Throughout the world, they are also known by a variety of other names, including &quot;slippers&quot; in the Bahamas, Hawai‘i, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago.

==History==
Thong sandals have been worn for thousands of years, as shown in images of them in ancient Egyptian murals from 4,000 BC. A pair found in Europe was made of papyrus leaves and dated to be approximately 1,500 years old. These early versions of flip-flops were made from a wide variety of materials. Ancient Egyptian sandals were made from papyrus and palm leaves. The Maasai people of Africa made them out of rawhide. In India, they were made from wood. In China and Japan, rice straw was used. The leaves of the sisal plant were used to make twine for sandals in South America, while the natives of Mexico used the yucca plant.

The ancient Greeks and Romans wore versions of flip-flops as well. In Greek sandals, the toe strap was worn between the first and second toes, while Roman sandals had the strap between the second and third toes. These differ from the sandals worn by the Mesopotamians, with the strap between the third and fourth toes. In India, a related &quot;toe knob&quot; sandal was common, with no straps but instead a small knob located between the first and second toes. They are known as Padukas.

The modern flip-flop became popular in the United States as soldiers returning from World War II brought Japanese zōri with them. It caught on in the 1950s during the postwar boom and after the end of hostilities of the Korean War. As they became adopted into American popular culture, the sandals were redesigned and made in the bright colors that dominated 1950s design. They quickly became popular due to their convenience and comfort, and were popular in beach-themed stores and as summer shoes. During the 1960s, flip-flops became firmly associated with the beach lifestyle of California. As such, they were promoted as primarily a casual accessory, typically worn with shorts, bathing suits, or summer dresses. When they became more popular, some people started wearing them for dressier or more formal occasions.
In 1962, Alpargatas S.A. marketed a version of flip-flops known as Havaianas in Brazil. By 2010, more than 150 million pairs of Havaianas were produced each year. By 2019, production tops 200 million pairs per year. Prices range from under $5 for basics to more than $50 for high-end fashion models.

Flip-flops quickly became popular as casual footwear for young adults. Girls would often decorate their flip-flops with metallic finishes, charms, chains, beads, rhinestones, or other jewelry. Modern flip-flops are available in leather, suede, cloth or synthetic materials such as plastic. Platform and high-heeled variants of the sandals began to appear in the 1990s, and in the late 2010s, kitten heeled &quot;kit-flops&quot;.

In the U.S., flip-flops with college colors and logos became common for fans to wear to intercollegiate games. In 2011, while vacationing in his native Hawaii, Barack Obama became the first President of the United States to be photographed wearing a pair of flip-flops. The Dalai Lama of Tibet is also a frequent wearer of flip-flops and has met with several U.S. presidents, including George W. Bush and Barack Obama, while wearing the sandals.

While exact sales figures for flip-flops are difficult to obtain due to the large number of stores and manufacturers involved, the Atlanta-based company Flip Flop Shops claimed that the shoes were responsible for a $20 billion industry in 2009. Furthermore, sales of flip-flops exceeded those of sneakers for the first time in 2006. If these figures are accurate, it is remarkable considering the low cost of most flip-flops.

==Design and custom==
The modern flip-flop has a straightforward design, consisting of a thin sole with two straps running in a Y shape from the sides of the foot to the gap between the big toe and the one beside it. Flip-flops are made from a wide variety of materials, as were the ancient thong sandals. The modern sandals are made of more modern materials, such as rubber, foam, plastic, leather, suede, and even fabric. Flip-flops made of polyurethane have caused some environmental concerns; because polyurethane is a number 7 resin, they can&#x27;t be easily discarded, and they persist in landfills for a very long time. In response to these concerns, some companies have begun selling flip-flops made from recycled rubber, such as that from used bicycle tires, or even hemp, and some offer a recycling program for used flip flops.

Because of the strap between the toes, flip-flops are typically not worn with socks. In colder weather, however, some people wear flip-flops with toe socks or merely pull standard socks forward and bunch them up between the toes. The Japanese commonly wear &quot;tabi&quot;, a type of sock with a single slot for the thong, with their &quot;zōri&quot;.

==Health issues==
Flip-flops provide the wearer with some mild protection from hazards on the ground, such as sharp rocks, splintery wooden surfaces, hot sand at the beach, broken glass, or even fungi and wart-causing viruses in locker rooms or community pool surfaces. However, walking for long periods in flip-flops can result in pain in the feet, ankles and lower legs or tendonitis.

The flip-flop straps may cause frictional issues, such as rubbing during walking, resulting in blisters, and the open-toed design may result in stubbed or even broken toes.
Particularly, individuals with flat feet or other foot issues are advised to wear a shoe or sandal with better support.

The American Podiatric Medical Association strongly recommends that people not play sports in flip-flops, or do any type of yard work with or without power tools, including cutting the grass, when they wear these shoes. There are reports of people who ran or jumped in flip-flops and suffered sprained ankles, fractures, and severe ligament injuries that required surgery.

Because they provide almost no protection from the sun, on a part of the body more heavily exposed and where sunscreen can more easily be washed off, sunburn can be a risk for flip-flop wearers.

==In popular culture==
For many Latin Americans, &quot;la chancla&quot; (the flip-flop), held or thrown, is known to be used as a tool of corporal punishment by mothers, similar to the use of slippers for the same purpose in Europe. Poor conduct in public may elicit being struck on the head with a flip-flop. The flip-flop may also be thrown at a misbehaving child. For many children, even the threat of the mother reaching down to take off a flip-flop and hold it in her raised hand is considered enough to correct their behaviour. The notoriety of the practice has become an Internet meme among Latin Americans and Hispanic and Latino immigrants to the United States. In recent years, the practice has been increasingly condemned as physically abusive. One essay, &quot;The Meaning of Chancla: Flip Flops and Discipline&quot;, seeks to end &quot;chancla culture&quot; in disciplining children. The term &quot;avaiana de pau&quot; (, named like wooden spoon), has become a popular meme in Brazilian internet culture, often used to depict exaggerated or humorous scenarios of the mother scolding her son. This term gained notoriety through videos and memes created by the Piologo brothers in 2004, who used it for comedic effect.

In India, a chappal is traditionally a leather slipper, but the term has also come to include flip-flops. A mother&#x27;s corporal punishment was often with a chappal, striking the child on the buttocks, hands or about the head and shoulders. Throwing a chappal became a video trope, &quot;flying chappal,&quot; and &quot;Flying chappal received&quot; an expression by an adult acknowledging that they had been verbally chastised by their parents or other adults.

Flip-flops are &quot;tsinelas&quot; in the Philippines, derived from the Spanish &quot;chinela&quot; (for slipper), and are used to discipline children, but with no mention of throwing. And children play Tumbang preso, which involves trying to knock over a can with thrown flip-flops.

When the Los Angeles–based Angel City FC and San Diego Wave FC joined the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League in 2022, a leader in an Angel City supporters&#x27; group called the new regional rivalry &quot;La Chanclásico&quot; as a nod to the region&#x27;s Hispanic heritage. The rivalry name combines &quot;chancla&quot; with &quot;clásico&quot; (&quot;classic&quot;), used in Spanish to describe many sports rivalries. The &quot;Chanclásico&quot; name quickly caught on with both fanbases, and before the first game between the teams, the aforementioned Angel City supporter created a rivalry trophy consisting of a flip-flop mounted on a trophy base and covered with gold spray paint. The rivalry name was effectively codified via a tweet from Wave and US national team star Alex Morgan.

As part of Q150 celebrations in 2009 celebrating the first 150 years of Queensland, Australia, the Queensland Government published a list of 150 cultural icons of Queensland, representing the people, places, events, and things that were significant to Queensland&#x27;s first 150 years. Thongs (as they are known in Queensland) were among as the Q150 Icons.

Flip-flops (known in New Zealand as jandals) are considered Kiwiana.

<text>John Vivian McVea (November 5, 1914 – December 27, 2000) was an American swing, blues, and rhythm and blues woodwind player and bandleader. He played clarinet and tenor and baritone saxophone.

==Career==
Born in Los Angeles, California, his father was the noted banjoist Satchel McVea, and banjo was Jack McVea&#x27;s first instrument. He played jazz in Los Angeles for several years, and joined Lionel Hampton&#x27;s orchestra in 1940. From 1944 on he mostly worked as a leader. He performed at the first Jazz at the Philharmonic concert in 1944.

Jack Mc Vea played at the famed Cavalcade of Jazz concert held at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles produced by Leon Hefflin Sr. on October 12, 1946. Lionel Hampton and his Orchestra, Slim Gaillard, T-Bone Walker, The Honeydrippers, Madaline Green, Winnie Brown, Reathis Stevens, Joan Benson and Louis Armstrong were all on the same program.

McVea was leader of the Black &amp; White Records studio band and was responsible for coming up with the musical riff for the words &quot;Open the Door, Richard&quot;. Ralph Bass persuaded him to record it in 1946 and it became immensely popular, entering the national charts the following year, and was recorded by many other artists.

From 1966 until his retirement in 1992, he led the Royal Street Bachelors, a group that played Dixieland jazz in New Orleans Square at Disneyland. The trio consisted of McVea on clarinet, Herb Gordy on string bass, Harold Grant and later Ernie McLean on guitar and banjo. According to McVea, he was not much of a clarinetist but learned overnight to play three songs to secure the job.

He is also known for his playing on T-Bone Walker&#x27;s &quot;Call It Stormy Monday (But Tuesday Is Just As Bad)&quot;. In 1945 he played tenor sax in a recording session for Slim Gaillard with Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie.

McVea died at home in Los Angeles in 2000.

<text>John Howe (born August 21, 1957) is a Canadian book illustrator and concept designer, best-known for his artwork of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth. 

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===

John Howe was born in Vancouver, British Columbia. He was drawing from pre-school age, with his mother&#x27;s help. Around primary school age he found his mother&#x27;s ability no longer living up to his expectations, and even got frustrated once at both his mother and himself at not being able to draw a cow to his expectations. Howe&#x27;s school years were complicated by moves which took place with a timing that left the art classes full, and left him in classes like power mechanics. He did find his ability as a draughtsman to be profitable in biology class though, where he and a friend would produce renderings of microscopic organisms for classmates at fifty cents each. As a child, he collected the covers of paperbacks. His collection included items from Frank Frazetta, Barry Smith, and Bernie Wrightson. In his adolescence, Howe read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy by J. R. R. Tolkien. He said he got &quot;a real spark&quot; from the Tolkien Calendars of paintings by the Brothers Hildebrandt, which showed him that Tolkien&#x27;s books could be illustrated. Howe made drawings of his own versions of the scenes depicted in the calendar. These drawings, according to Howe, may not have survived.

A year after his high school graduation, Howe moved to Strasbourg, France to attend college. The following year, he enrolled into the École des arts décoratifs. He cites his experience of this period as follows:

Throughout his first years in Europe, Howe was taking in as much as he could in the way of art, architecture and everything that was &quot;simultaneously ancient and novel.&quot; He says the only piece of his art work that survived from this period is his &quot;The Lieutenant of the Black Tower of Barad-dûr&quot;, a piece inspired by Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. He says if this is not his first published piece, it must certainly be the earliest. Howe&#x27;s earliest commissions included political cartoons, magazine illustrations, comics, animated films, advertising, of which he says were nightmares. He said that he would end up redoing sketches so many times that there was nothing left of &quot;his&quot; in them. This frustrated him, and he wondered how he would ever make it in the profession.

=== Career ===



Howe has worked on projects including &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s Books and Merchandise, &quot;Beowulf&quot;, Robin Hobb&#x27;s books, &quot;The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe&quot;, Cards for &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, &quot;Pan&#x27;s Labyrinth&quot;. He has written and illustrated several children&#x27;s books.

Howe and the Tolkien artist Alan Lee served as chief conceptual designers for Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; movie trilogy. Howe illustrated the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; board game created by Reiner Knizia, and re-illustrated the maps of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, and &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; in 1996–2003. His work includes images of mythological material such as the Old English epic poem &quot;Beowulf&quot; (such as Knizia&#x27;s board game &quot;&quot;). Howe illustrated many books in the fantasy genre, such as those by Robin Hobb. He contributed to the film adaptation of &quot;The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe&quot; by C. S. Lewis, &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;. In 2005 a limited edition of George R. R. Martin&#x27;s novel &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; was released by Meisha Merlin, with numerous illustrations by Howe.

Howe has illustrated cards for the &quot;&quot; collectible card game.

For &quot;The Hobbit&quot; films, original director Guillermo del Toro and replacement director Peter Jackson consulted with both Howe and fellow concept artist Alan Lee to ensure continuity of design.

Howe is a member of the living history group the Company of Saynt George, and has expertise in ancient and medieval armour and armaments.

Howe served as a concept designer for Amazon&#x27;s 2022 &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power&quot;.

<doc id="417783" wikidata="Q5527395" url="?curid=417783" title="Gathorne Gathorne-Hardy, 1st Earl of Cranbrook">
<text>Gathorne Gathorne-Hardy, 1st Earl of Cranbrook, (1 October 1814 – 30 October 1906) was a prominent British Conservative politician. He held cabinet office in every Conservative government between 1858 and 1892. He served as Home Secretary from 1867 to 1868, Secretary of State for War from 1874 to 1878, Lord President of the Council from 1885 to 1886 and as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster until 1886. In 1878, he was appointed Secretary of State for India and thereafter was elevated to the peerage, entering the House of Lords as Viscount Cranbrook. He has been described as a moderate, middle-of-the-road Anglican, and a key ally of Disraeli.

== Background and education ==
Gathorne Hardy was the third son of John Hardy and Isabel Gathorne, daughter of Richard Gathorne, of Kirkby Lonsdale, Cumbria. His older brother was Sir John Hardy, 1st Baronet. His father was a barrister and businessman, the main owner of the Low Moor ironworks and also represented Bradford in Parliament as a Conservative. His immediate ancestors had been attorneys and stewards to the Spencer-Stanhope family of Horsforth since the beginning of the 18th century. 

He was educated at Shrewsbury School and Oriel College, Oxford, and was called to the Bar, Inner Temple, in 1840. He established a successful legal practice on the Northern Circuit, being based in Leeds, but was denied when he applied for silk in 1855.

==Early political career, 1847–1874==
Gathorne Hardy had unsuccessfully contested Bradford in the 1847 general election. However, after his father&#x27;s death in 1855 he was able to concentrate fully on a political career, and in 1856 he was elected for Leominster. Only two years later, in 1858, he was appointed Under-Secretary of State for Home Affairs in the second administration of the Earl of Derby. He remained in this office until the government fell in June 1859.

In 1865, Gathorne Hardy reluctantly agreed to stand against William Ewart Gladstone in the Oxford University constituency. However, on 17 July 1865, he defeated Gladstone by a majority of 180, which greatly enhanced his standing within the Conservative party thanks to the influence of rural clergy voters, but still did not come first in the poll. Gladstone&#x27;s response was &quot;Dear Dream is dispelled. God&#x27;s will be done&quot;. The Conservatives returned to office under Derby in 1866, and Hardy was appointed President of the Poor Law Board, with a seat in the cabinet. He was admitted to the Privy Council at the same time. During his tenure in this office he notably carried a poor law amendment bill through parliament. Cranbrook also supported the Reform Act of 1867, which significantly increased the size of the electorate to one in five. By May, Disraeli had recognised Gathorne Hardy&#x27;s value to the Conservatives as a rising star in the Commons, proving a capable debater, a resilient antagonist to Gladstone, and &quot;nobody&#x27;s fool&quot;. In 1867 he succeeded Spencer Horatio Walpole as Home Secretary and was forced to deal with the Fenian Rising of that year. By accepting an amendment that all ratepayers should be enfranchised, Disraeli had created a new Victorian constitution, which surprisingly Hardy and others were prepared to accept. One new entrant in 1868, an admirer of Disraeli, the Radical, Sir Charles Dilke thought Hardy the most eloquent Englishman, whose talents were wasted in the Conservative Party. But Hardy himself, not so easily deceived, remained a stalwart Tory to the end.

The next year, Benjamin Disraeli succeeded Derby as Prime Minister, but the Conservative government resigned in autumn 1868, after both the Queen and Disraeli delayed dissolution to register a new electorate, which since 1865 had accepted postal votes. The Liberals came to power under Gladstone. In opposition, Hardy occasionally acted as opposition leader in the House of Commons when Disraeli was absent.

There was criticism of the Anglican Church in Ireland, which Liberals intended to disestablish in its entirety. A committed Anglican, Hardy opposed the measure on religious grounds:&quot;I say that the Church of Ireland has made many converts; not, it may be, by violent controversial proceedings, but by a quiet influence which has affected the minds of those who have been around her clergy, and who have gradually become leavened by their sentiments&quot;.Being an orthodox Anglican he considered fragmentation of the church as contrariwise to Conservative principles. &quot;I have faith in the principles we are professing, and when I am told by the right hon. Gentleman the President of the Board of Trade, and by others who have spoken like him, that all thoughtful men are against the Irish Church, that for fifty years every Statesman has looked forward to some such consummation.&quot; He spoke manfully in the Irish Church bill debate on 23 March 1869, before Gladstone gave the government&#x27;s winding-up in one of the greatest oratorical expositions during the second reading. Hardy linked the Irish church bill to the Fenian rising and resulting atrocities, vis-à-vis a Catholic church allegedly willing to sell benefices for money. Moreover, he directly attacked the Prime Minister&#x27;s followers whom he accused of being &quot;indebted to the Fenian movement for that tardy measure of justice. This shows the encouragement to disloyalty given by this measure.&quot; And in provoking the government he linked tendentiously Baron Plunket, the nationalist, to the Liberal Party: which no doubt they disowned.

During debates on education Hardy produced eloquent and stinging rebukes that deflected time from Gladstone&#x27;s Irish reform agenda. Hardy proved an able lieutenant in the Disraelian tradition, mocking Gladstone&#x27;s bill&#x27;s cumbersome progress through the Commons. Gladstone gradually became hotter and bothered by Cranbrook&#x27;s adroit remarks. When he was likened to the Hyde Park riots of 1866, the Prime Minister &quot;caused such an explosion of passion and temper.&quot;

The defeat threatened Disraeli&#x27;s party leadership, but despite being considered Hardy declined, whilst the great man was still &#x27;looking over his shoulder&#x27;. On 1 February 1872, Hardy was present at the Burghley House Conference of Tory grandees: only Derby and Disraeli were missing for the discussion about the party&#x27;s and country&#x27;s future. Hosted by Lord Exeter, a Cecil descendant of the Elizabethan Lord Burghley, other Cabinet members were Sir Stafford Northcote, Sir John Pakington, Lord Cairns, and Lord John Manners, a personal friend of Disraeli. Only Manners and Northcote were prepared to support Disraeli&#x27;s continued leadership. The group suggested that Lord Stanley, Derby&#x27;s son, take the Commons post of party leader. For his part, the younger Stanley was a very different character than his father. Short and plump, Stanley was a reformer, open to change, and ideas around progressive politics. He was also more amenable to Disraeli, recognizing that he was unfit, he did not wish to displace a man whom backbenchers knew was the outstanding parliamentarian. Stanley&#x27;s neutrality would convert other cabinet members towards acceptance of the flamboyant Jew. Latterly, Hardy worked well with Disraeli, although they were not close intimates. At the end of the month the mood in London lifted: the Prince of Wales was out of trouble, and Hardy amongst others attended a service of thanksgiving and praise at St Paul&#x27;s on 27 February.

==Cabinet minister, 1874–1880==

In 1874, the Conservatives returned to office under Disraeli, and Hardy was appointed Secretary of State for War, for which he was not best suited. He should have been offered the Home Office, but this went to a fine debater, Richard Cross. But the House rose on 7 August, leaving the minister the remainder of the year to settle into departmental work. Hardy stayed in post for more than four years overseeing the army reforms initiated by his Liberal predecessor Edward Cardwell. In 1876, Disraeli was elevated to the peerage, and the House of Lords, as Earl of Beaconsfield. Hardy had expected to become Conservative leader in the House of Commons, but was overlooked in favour of Sir Stafford Northcote; Disraeli disliked the fact Hardy neglected the house to go home in the evening to dine with his wife. 

Two years later, in April 1878, Hardy succeeded The Marquess of Salisbury as Secretary of State for India, and the following month he was raised to the peerage as Viscount Cranbrook, of Hemsted in the County of Kent. At the same time, he assumed by royal license his mother&#x27;s maiden surname of Gathorne in addition to that of Hardy. In December 1878, Cranbrook attended court, and heard from the Queen her complaints about Gladstone&#x27;s mishandling of the Prince of Wales&#x27; rejection of the proposal to make him Viceroy of Ireland. Cranbrook remained one of the ministers at the centre of the court being a monarchist, frequently interacting with the Queen and Prince of Wales; indeed, Cranbrook &quot;won the full confidence and warm personal regard of Queen Victoria&quot;. When Gladstone&#x27;s portrait was shown in public, Cranbrook tactfully observed protocol.

The Eastern Question had posed the biggest single foreign policy dilemma in 1877. Hardy was in favour of actively pursuing the bankrupted Sultan with a loan, and going to war if necessary to keep Russia out of Constantinople. He proved one of Disraeli&#x27;s closest allies in cabinet. Cranbrook was a relative &quot;parvenu&quot;; the rich aristocrats wanted peace and so did Gladstone, at any price. But he was vindicated; when Salisbury swapped sides to support the PM, he was raised to Foreign Minister. A &#x27;War Party&#x27;, an Inner Cabinet, sent Royal Navy battleships to defend the Turks against a threatening Russian Army. At the India Office Cranbrook was forced to deal with the Second Afghan War in 1878, aimed at restoring British influence in Afghanistan. After a peaceful summer of 1878 deer-stalking in Scotland, Cranbrook returned to a crisis dealing with an ill-prepared Viceroy of India. A full invasion of Afghanistan was ordered on 21 November. The Afghans were defeated within weeks, but the new Third Empire had begun in a state of panic. A peace deal was struck in May 1879, but war again erupted after the British resident, Sir Louis Cavagnari, was murdered by mutinous Afghan troops. British troops under Frederick Roberts managed once again to restore control. However, the situation was still volatile when Cranbrook, along with the rest of the government, resigned in April 1880. As a peer Cranbrook was disqualified from making speeches during elections, which ended in a Liberal majority. He took a well-earned rest in Italy early in 1881, and was still there when the only one of Disraeli&#x27;s cabinet absent for the Earl of Beaconsfield&#x27;s funeral at Hughenden.

==Tory grandee==

Lord Cranbrook remained at the heart of the party elite. In 1884 a new Chief Whip, Aretas Akers-Douglas gained promotion from Salisbury partly through the austere influence of this knowledgeable and experienced grandee. In early 1885 the government was rent with division, Chamberlain refusing to agree with the franchise as &#x27;ransom&#x27; of private property. Cranbrook wrote to Lord Cairns on 9 January, &quot;all this comes from the Irish policy for wh. Mr Gladstone is responsible.&quot; The writing was on the wall for the government. In June 1885 the Conservatives returned to power as &quot;Caretakers&quot;, and Cranbrook was made Lord President of the Council. Cranbrook was shocked to find out that behind the cabinet&#x27;s back Lord Carnarvon had been negotiating a deal, known in the newspapers as &#x27;Tory Parnellism&#x27;, with the Irish Party.

For two weeks in early 1886 he again served as Secretary of State for War. The government fell in January 1886 but soon returned to office in July of the same year after a General Election under a new franchise. Cranbrook was once again appointed Lord President of the council, in which office he was mainly concerned with education. He also served briefly as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in August 1886. He declined the post of Foreign Secretary in 1886 owing to his inability to speak foreign languages, and also refused the viceroyalty of Ireland. Perhaps the stolid familiarity of the council was additionally welcome after the turmoil in government caused by Lord Randolph Churchill&#x27;s erratic, argumentative behaviour. He remained as Lord President of the council until the second Salisbury ministry fell in 1892. Shortly after, he was further honoured when he was made Baron Medway, of Hemsted in the County of Kent, and Earl of Cranbrook, in the County of Kent. In opposition, Cranbrook was a strong opponent of the Second Home Rule Bill, which was heavily defeated in the House of Lords. He retired from public life after the 1895 general election. He settled down as a country squire at his Hemsted Park estate, and served as a Justice of the peace for Kent and Yorkshire, and also as a Deputy lieutenant.

== Marriage and family ==

In 1838, Cranbrook married Jane Stewart Orr (1813–1897), the daughter of James Orr and Jane Stewart. They had three sons and two daughters:
* Lady Margaret Evelyn Gathorne-Hardy (died 11 July 1943), who married George Goschen, 2nd Viscount Goschen, and had three children.
* Lady Edith Elizabeth Gathorne-Hardy (died 8 January 1875), who married Sir Henry Graham.

* John Stewart Gathorne-Hardy, 2nd Earl of Cranbrook (22 March 1839 – 13 July 1911), who married Cicely Ridgway, and had seven children.
* Col. Hon. Charles Gathorne Gathorne-Hardy (11 May 1841 – 17 February 1919)
* Hon. Alfred Erskine Gathorne-Hardy (27 February 1845 – 11 November 1918), a Conservative Member of Parliament and writer.

One son and two of their daughters predeceased them.

He owned 5,188 acres, in Kent and Sussex but the vast majority of these in Kent.

== Death and legacy ==
Lord Cranbrook died in October 1906 aged 92 at his residence Hemsted Park, near Benenden, Kent. He was succeeded in the Earldom of Cranbrook by his eldest son John. His will was proven by probate at over £274,000, equivalent to over £40 million in the present day.

His obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; stated the following:

<doc id="417785" wikidata="Q6437451" url="?curid=417785" title="Krishna Maharaj">
<text>Krishna Nanan Maharaj (; 26 January 1939 – 5 August 2024) was a British Trinidadian businessman. In 1987 he was convicted by a Florida, U.S., court of the double murders of Chinese Jamaican businessmen Derrick Moo Young and his adult son Duane Moo Young, and was sentenced to death. Maharaj always denied committing the murders, and according to the human rights organisation Reprieve, the case of Krishna Maharaj was &quot;an epic miscarriage of justice&quot;.

Although Reprieve claimed that on 13 September 2019, Federal Magistrate Judge Alicia M. Otazo-Reyes made a legal finding that Maharaj had proven his innocence by &quot;clear and convincing evidence&quot; and that &quot;no reasonable juror could convict him&quot; but ruled that this was not sufficient for Maharaj to be set free, their claim is false. In Maharaj v. Florida Dept. of Corrections, No. 1:17-cv-21965 (S.D. Fla.), on 13 Sept. 2019, MJ Otazo-Reyes only ordered an evidentiary hearing. On 11 Sept. 2020, MJ Otazo-Reyes recommended that his habeas petition be denied, and on 30 Nov. 2020, District Judge Jose Martinez affirmed that recommendation, writing in part:
== Background ==
Maharaj was of Indo-Trinidadian descent and was the brother of Ramesh Maharaj, former Attorney General of Trinidad and Tobago. He was also the brother of Indra Rambachan (née Maharaj), who is the wife of National Award-winner lawyer Roopnarine Rambachan.

== Charge and detention ==
According to the prosecution, in December 1986 Maharaj arranged a false meeting with Derrick Moo Young in the DuPont Plaza Hotel, in order to demand of Moo Young to repay money that he had fraudulently taken from Maharaj&#x27;s relatives in Trinidad. Derrick Moo Young turned up at room 1215 together with his son Duane. Once inside the room, Maharaj is said to have appeared with a gun from behind a door. An argument resulted, and the father, Derrick Moo Young, was allegedly shot to death by Maharaj. The prosecution stated that the son, Duane, was then taken upstairs in the suite and shot by Maharaj.

In 1997, a Florida court overturned the death sentence. In 2001, almost 300 British politicians, church leaders and judges wrote a letter to the then Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, asking for a retrial. The letter stated that there were &quot;astonishing flaws&quot; in the case against Maharaj. Among those signing the letter were Lord Goldsmith, then Attorney General for England and Wales and Northern Ireland, Lynda Clark, then Advocate General for Scotland, Charles Kennedy, then Leader of the Liberal Democrats, Ken Livingstone, then Mayor of London, and Nicholas Lyell, former Attorney General for England and Wales and Northern Ireland.

The governor denied him a retrial; Maharaj was instead re-sentenced to life imprisonment in 2002.

In 2006, the British human rights organisation Reprieve made an appeal to Governor Jeb Bush for clemency on Maharaj&#x27;s behalf, pointing out that the jury had heard from none of Maharaj&#x27;s alibi witnesses, who would have put him 25 miles away at the time of the murder; that the prosecution&#x27;s star witness had changed his story several times; and that evidence had emerged since the trial that the murder victims were involved in money laundering and had links to drug traffickers, and that there were a number of alternative suspects with strong motives, which had not been considered at the time.
The appeal was denied.

In 2008, Reprieve made a second appeal for clemency to the then Governor of Florida, Charlie Crist, but this appeal was also denied.

On 24 April 2014, Judge William Thomas, from the 11th Judicial Circuit Court of Florida, Miami, allowed Maharaj&#x27;s lawyer to present witnesses during an evidentiary hearing.
On 14 November 2014, Henry Cuervo, a former US Drug Enforcement Administration Agent, told a court that ex-hitman Jhon Jairo Velásquez Vásquez had confessed to him that Pablo Escobar had arranged the hit on the Moo Youngs. Cuervo said that Velásquez wanted to clear his conscience and had asked Cuervo to testify on his behalf. He also submitted an affidavit from Velásquez – a cartel assassin known as &quot;Popeye&quot; who was recently released from prison in Colombia, where he is reviled as one of the country&#x27;s most infamous killers.

On 4 April 2017, the US 11th Circuit Court of Appeals granted a hearing based on evidence pointing to the involvement of Pablo Escobar&#x27;s Medellín Cartel in the killings of which Maharaj had been convicted. The court said that the additional witnesses had presented &quot;compelling&quot; accounts that &quot;independently corroborate one another&#x27;s&quot; and that &quot;[a]ll five individuals&#x27; stories reflect that the Moo Youngs were killed by the cartel.&quot;

Maharaj died on 5 August 2024, at the age of 85. His body was flown to the United Kingdom, where his wife lives in the town of Bridport in Dorset. His funeral was held on 27 August 2024 in West Bay.

<text>A cog is a type of ship that was used during the Middle Ages, mostly for trade and transport but also in war. It first appeared in the 10th century, and was widely used from around the 12th century onward. Cogs were clinker-built, generally of oak. Cogs were fitted with a single mast and a single square sail. They were used primarily for trade in north-west medieval Europe, especially by the Hanseatic League. Typical seagoing cogs were from 15 to 25 meters (49 to 82 ft) long, 5 to 8 meters (16 to 26 ft) wide, and were of 30–200 tons burthen. Cogs were rarely as large as 300 tons although a few were considerably larger, over 1,000 tons.

Although the name cog is recorded as early as the 9th century, the seagoing vessel of that name seems to have evolved on the Frisian coast during the 12th century. Cogs progressively replaced Viking-type vessels such as knarrs in northern waters during the 13th century. Cogs could carry more cargo than knarrs of a similar size. Their flat bottoms allowed them to settle on a level in harbour, making them easier to load and unload. Their high sides made them more difficult to board in a sea fight, which made them safer from pirates.

==Description and construction==
Cogs were a type of round ship, characterized by a flush-laid flat bottom at midships which gradually shifted to overlapped strakes near the posts. They were propelled by a single, large, rectangular sail. Typical seagoing cogs ranged from about 15 to 25 meters (49 to 82 ft) in length with a beam of 5 to 8 meters (16 to 26 ft) and were 40–200 tons burthen. Cogs were rarely as large as 300 tons, although a very small number were considerably larger, over 1,000 tons. A rule of thumb for crew size was that one sailor, exclusive of any dedicated fighting men, was required for every 10 tons burthen of the cog, although this may generate a suggested crew size on the low side of Medieval practice. Crews of up to 45 for civilian cogs are recorded, and 60 for a 240 ton cog being used for military transportation.

Cogs were typically constructed largely of oak, and had full lapstrake, or clinker, planking covering their sides, generally starting from the bilge strakes, with double-clenched iron nails for plank fastenings. At the stem, are formed; that is, in each case, the of the lower strake is tapered to a feather edge at the end of the strake where it meets the stem or stern-post. This allows the end of the strake to be fastened to the with the outside of the planking mutually flush at that point and flush with the stem. This means that the boat&#x27;s passage through the water will not tend to lift the ends of the planking away from the stem. Before the next plank is fitted, the face of the on the lower strake is bevelled to suit the angle at which the next strake will lie in relation with it. This varies all along the land. The new strake is held in position on the preceding one before the fastening is done.

The keel, or keel-plank, was only slightly thicker than the adjacent garboards and had no rabbet. Both stem and stern-posts were straight and rather long, and connected to the keel-plank through intermediate pieces called . The lower plank terminated in rabbets in the hooks and posts, but upper hoods were nailed to the exterior faces of the posts. Caulking was generally tarred moss that was inserted into curved grooves, covered with wooden laths, and secured by metal staples called &quot;sintels&quot;. The cog-built structure would be completed with a stern-mounted, hanging, central rudder on a heavy stern-post, which was a uniquely northern development. The single, thick, mast was set forward of amidships, stepped into the keel-plank and equipped with a single large, rectangular, square-rigged sail. The masts of larger vessels would be of composite construction. Complicated systems of rigging were developed to support the mast and to operate the sail. Cordage was usually hemp or flax and the sail hemp-based canvas. From the 13th century cogs would be decked and larger vessels would be fitted with a stern castle, to afford more cargo space by keeping the crew and tiller up, out of the way; and to give the helmsman a better view.

A cog, compared with the carvel-built vessels more traditional in the Mediterranean, was expensive and required specialist shipwrights. However, their simpler sail setup meant that cogs only required half the crew of similar-sized vessels equipped with lateen sails, as were common in the Mediterranean. A structural benefit of clinker construction is that it produces a vessel that can safely twist and flex around its long axis (running from bow to stern), which is an advantage in North Atlantic rollers, provided the vessel has a small overall displacement. A limitation of cogs is that they lack points to mount additional masts: at least some fore-and-aft sails are desirable for maneuverability but clinker-built cogs were effectively limited to a single sail. This made them unhandy, limiting their ability to tack in the harbour and making them very reliant on wind direction at the start of voyages. The flat bottom permitted cogs to be readily beached and unloaded at low tide when quays were not available; a useful trait when purpose-built jetties were not common. Cogs were expected to have a working life of approximately 40 years.

==History==
The earliest origins of the cog are believed to be logboats from around northern Germany. These developed into larger craft built in the same basic shape, but with planking instead of hollowed-out logs. Another development was into &quot;Kahnen&quot;, flat-bottomed boats, with pointed ends for and aft that were constructed by splitting a hollowed-out log and widening the bottom with planks that were nailed to knee-shaped ribs attached to the sides. The pointed ends (called &quot;Block&quot; locally) of the log would be cut off and attached separately to the widened hull which resulted in so-called &quot;Blockkahnen&quot;, variants of which are still in use. The earliest evidence of a cog-like craft is a clay model found in Leese on the middle Weser from the grave of an adult male who died around 200 BC. Fragments of similar clay models have been found in nearby regions.

Trade from Germania in Roman times was mostly carried on Mediterranean-style sailing vessels and controlled by Roman merchants. After Roman power collapsed in the middle of the first millennium AD, transports on the large river estuaries and the sheltered waters of the Wadden Sea was taken over by Frisians who used vessels based on indigenous, flat-bottomed designs that were precursors of later medieval cogs. These had much lower sides than later cogs and would have been very similar to contemporary Scandinavian craft, such as knarrs. The oldest depiction of a vessel identified by contemporary sources as a cog is the Lübeck city seal from 1223. The early cogs were fitted with a side-mounted rudder oar that also functioned as a leeboard and was rigged with a single broad square sail that functioned similar to a lug sail.

Around 1200, the side rudder began to be replaced with a centerline rudder attached to a sternpost and developed in the typical medieval cog. Cogs could carry more cargo than knarrs; the rudder made steering easier than did the steering oar of the knarr, especially for larger vessels; and cogs were cheaper to build. The latter was due to the cog&#x27;s use of sawn rather than split planks which was less wasteful. Fore and stern castles would later be added for defense against pirates, or to enable the use of these vessels as warships. The stern castle also afforded more cargo space below by keeping the crew and tiller up, out of the way.

Current archaeological evidence points to the Frisian coast or Western Jutland as the possible birthplace of this type of vessel. The transformation of the cog into a true seagoing trader came not only during the time of the intense trade between West and East but also as a direct answer to the closure of the western entrance to the Limfjord. For centuries, the Limfjord in northern Jutland offered a fairly protected passage between the North Sea and the Baltic. Due to its unusual geographical conditions and strong currents, the passage was constantly filling with sand and was completely blocked by the early 12th century. This change produced new challenges. The larger ships, which could not be pulled across the sand bars, had to sail around the Jutland peninsula and circumnavigate the dangerous Cape Skagen to get to the Baltic. This resulted in major modifications to old ship structures, which can be observed by analyzing the evolution of the earliest cog finds of Kollerup, Skagen, and Kolding. This caused a boom in the number of small cogs, and the need for spacious and seaworthy ships led to the development of the cog as the workhorse of the Hanseatic League. It soon became the main cargo carrier in Atlantic and Baltic waters.

Eventually, around the 14th century, the cog reached its structural limits, and larger or more seaworthy vessels needed to be of a different type. This was the hulk, which already existed but was much less common than the cog. There is no evidence that hulks descended from cogs, but it is clear that a lot of technological ideas were adapted between the two types. The transition from cogs to hulks was not linear, according to some interpretations, both vessels coexisted for many centuries but followed diverse lines of evolution.

===Archaeology===
The first archaeological find that was identified as a cog, was a ship wreck discovered in 1944 by P. J. R. Modderman in the Noordoostpolder near Emmeloord (plot NM 107). The wreck was reburied in situ and a 2008 re-excavation confirmed the interpretation as a cog. It was around 16 m long and its wood dated from 1339. The discovery by Modderman was however not well known in the literature.

The most famous cog in existence today is the Bremen cog. The artifact originates from the 1380s and was discovered in 1962. Prior to this discovery, the existence of cogs was primarily documented in medieval texts and seals. In 1990 the well-preserved remains of a Hanseatic cog were discovered in the estuary sediment of the Pärnu River in Estonia which has been dated to 1300. In 2012, a cog dating from the early 15th century was discovered preserved from the keel up to the decks in the silt of the River IJssel in the city of Kampen, Netherlands. During its excavation and recovery an intact brick dome oven and glazed tiles were found in the galley as well as a number of other artifacts. 

In April 2022, a 13th-century cog was found in Tallinn, Estonia during highway construction. It is believed to be better preserved than the Bremen cog and a dendrochronology test on the wood has dated the wreck to 1298. The ship is 24 meters long and nine meters wide. The boards are intact up to three meters from the bottom of the ship.

<text>William A. Paterson (October 3, 1838 – September 8, 1921) was born in Canada in 1838 and arrived in Flint, Michigan in 1868. He established the W. A. Paterson Company, a carriage-manufacturer. One of the original stockholders of Buick Motor Company, he entered the automobile business for himself and marketed the Paterson automobile (1908 to 1923).

From 1891 to 1892 he served as mayor of the City of Flint. He was also involved in founding the Union Trust Savings Bank.

Paterson constructed a new office on the corner of S. Saginaw and Third Streets. The Paterson Building still stands today. The building, now owned by Communities First, Inc., has been maintained to reflect its beautiful glory, rich in art deco, inside and out.

<doc id="417797" wikidata="Q102108" url="?curid=417797" title="Alan Lee (illustrator)">
<text>Alan Lee (born 20 August 1947) is an English book illustrator and film conceptual designer. He is best known for his artwork inspired by J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s fantasy novels, and for his work on the concept design of Peter Jackson&#x27;s film adaptations of Tolkien, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit&quot; film series.

== Early life and education ==

Alan Lee was born in Middlesex, England, and studied at the Ealing School of Art.

== Career ==

===Illustration===

==== Tolkien ====

Lee has illustrated dozens of fantasy books, including some non-fiction, and many more book covers. 
Among the numerous works by J. R. R. Tolkien that he has illustrated are the 1992 centenary edition of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, a 1999 edition of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, the 2007 &quot;The Children of Húrin&quot;, the 2017 &quot;Beren and Lúthien&quot;, the 2018 &quot;The Fall of Gondolin&quot;, and the 2022 &quot;The Fall of Númenor&quot;. He has given numerous conferences, interviews and masterclasses, such as the one recorded at the Bibliothèque nationale de France in 2020, during the exhibition &quot;Tolkien : voyage en Terre du Milieu&quot;.

==== Other illustrations ====

Non-Tolkien books he has illustrated include &quot;Faeries&quot; (with Brian Froud), &quot;Lavondyss&quot; by Robert Holdstock, &quot;The Mabinogion&quot; (two versions), &quot;Castles&quot; by David Day, &quot;The Mirrorstone&quot; by Michael Palin, &quot;The Moon&#x27;s Revenge&quot; by Joan Aiken, and &quot;Merlin Dreams&quot; by Peter Dickinson.

He has illustrated retellings of classics for young people. Two were Rosemary Sutcliff&#x27;s versions of the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot;—namely, &quot;Black Ships Before Troy&quot; (Oxford, 1993) and &quot;The Wanderings of Odysseus&quot; (Frances Lincoln, 1995). Another was Adrian Mitchell&#x27;s version of Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;—namely, &quot;Shapeshifters&quot; (Frances Lincoln, 2009).

Lee made cover paintings for the 1983 Penguin edition of Mervyn Peake&#x27;s &quot;Gormenghast&quot; trilogy. He also did the artwork for &quot;Alive!&quot;, a 2007 CD by the Dutch band Omnia, released during the Castlefest festival. Watercolour painting and pencil sketches are among the media that Lee commonly uses.

=== Film ===

==== Tolkien ====

Lee and John Howe were the lead concept artists of Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; films between 2000 and 2003. They were recruited by director Guillermo del Toro in 2008 for continuity of design in the subsequent &quot;The Hobbit&quot; films, before joining Jackson when he took over the &quot;Hobbit&quot; films project. Jackson has explained how he originally recruited the reclusive Lee. By courier to Lee&#x27;s home in the south of England, he sent two of his previous films, &quot;Forgotten Silver&quot; and &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot;, with a note from himself and Fran Walsh that piqued Lee&#x27;s interest enough for him to become involved. Lee went on to illustrate and even to help construct many of the scenarios for the movies, including objects and weapons for the actors. For example his illustration of the tower of Orthanc was closely followed by the set designers of &quot;The Two Towers&quot; to create a &quot;bigature&quot; at 1:35 scale for close-up filming. He made two cameo appearances: in the opening sequence of &quot;The Fellowship&quot; as one of the nine kings of men who became the Nazgûl; and in &quot;The Two Towers&quot; as a Rohan soldier in the armoury (over the shoulder of Viggo Mortensen&#x27;s Aragorn who is talking to Legolas in Elvish).

Two years after completing &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film series, Lee released a 192-page collection of his concept artwork for the project, &quot;The Lord of the Rings Sketchbook&quot; (HarperCollins, 2005). Peter Jackson said, &quot;His art captured what I hoped to capture with the films.&quot;

==== Other films ====

Lee worked as a concept designer on the films &quot;Legend&quot;, &quot;Erik the Viking&quot;, &quot;King Kong&quot; and the television mini-series &quot;Merlin.&quot; The art book &quot;Faeries&quot;, produced in collaboration with Brian Froud, was the basis of a 1981 animated feature of the same name.

== Awards ==

For illustrating &quot;Merlin Dreams&quot; by Peter Dickinson (1988), he won the annual Chesley Award for Best Interior Illustration and he was a highly commended runner-up for the Greenaway Medal. He also won the BSFA Award for Best Artwork, for that year&#x27;s best single new image. 
Five years later, he won the Kate Greenaway Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year&#x27;s best children&#x27;s book illustration by a British subject. The book was &quot;Black Ships Before Troy&quot; by Rosemary Sutcliff, a version of the Trojan War story.
For the 60th anniversary edition of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, Tolkien&#x27;s 1937 classic, Lee won his second Chesley Award for Interior Illustration (he is a finalist eight times through 2011).
For that year&#x27;s work he won the annual World Fantasy Award, Best Artist, at the 1998 World Fantasy Convention.
In 2000, he won the competitive, juried Spectrum Award for fantastic art in the grandmaster category.
Lee, Grant Major and Dan Hennah earned the 2004 Academy Award for Best Art Direction for &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;, third in the film trilogy.
In 2016 he was awarded the &#x27;Schwäbischen Lindwurm&#x27; of the

<text>William Paterson (April 1658 - 22 January 1719) was a Scottish trader and banker. He was the founder of the Bank of England and was one of the main proponents of the catastrophic Darien scheme. Later he became an advocate of union with England.

==Biography==
=== Early life ===
William Paterson was born in his parents&#x27; farmhouse at Tinwald in Dumfriesshire, Scotland, and lived with them until he was seventeen, when he emigrated first (briefly) to Bristol and then to the Bahamas, although accounts differ as to the duration of his stays. During his time in the West Indies he first conceived the idea of the Darién scheme, his plan to create a colony on the isthmus of Panama, facilitating trade with the Far East. While in the West Indies, it is said that he acted as a merchant, developing a reputation for business acumen and dealings with local buccaneers. Walter Herries claimed that the English privateer William Dampier shared his knowledge of Darién with Paterson.

=== Career ===

Paterson returned to Europe by the middle of the 1680s, and attempted to convince the English government under James II to undertake the Darién scheme. When they refused, he tried again to persuade the governments of the Holy Roman Empire, the Dutch Republic and Bradenburg to establish a colony in Panama, but failed in each case.

Paterson then went to London in 1687 and made his fortune with foreign trade (primarily through the slave trade with the West Indies) in the Merchant Taylors&#x27; Company. He also helped to found a company for supplying water to North London from the Hampstead Hills, known as the Hampstead Water Company which existed until the late 19th century.

In 1694, he co-founded the Bank of England. It was said that the project originated with him in 1691, as described in his pamphlet &quot;A Brief Account of the Intended Bank of England&quot;, to act as the English government&#x27;s banker. He proposed a loan of £1.2m to the government; in return the subscribers would be incorporated as The Governor and Company of the Bank of England with banking privileges including the issue of notes. The Royal Charter was granted on 27 July 1694. On the foundation of the bank in 1694 he became a director. In 1695, owing to a disagreement with his colleagues, he withdrew from the board and devoted himself to the colony of Darien, unsuccessfully planted in 1698.

===Darien scheme===

Paterson relocated to Edinburgh, where he was able to convince the Scottish government to undertake the Darién scheme, a failed attempt to found an independent Scottish Empire in what is today Panama. Paterson personally accompanied the disastrous Scottish expedition to Panama in 1698, where his wife, Hannah Kemp, and their child died, while he himself became seriously ill. On his return to Scotland in December 1699, he became instrumental in the movement for the Union of Scotland and England, culminating in his support of the Act of Union 1707. He spent the last years of his life in Westminster, and died in January 1719. A mystery still surrounds the burial site of Paterson. Many (including officials at the Bank of England), believe he is buried in Sweetheart Abbey, New Abbey, Dumfries and Galloway.

* &quot;Proposals and Reasons for Constitulating a Council of Trade&quot; (1701), a plan to create a Scottish council of Trade which would stimulate the Scottish economy and trade, partly by abolishing export duties. 
* &quot;A Proposal to plant a Colony in Darién to protect the Indians against Spain, and to open the Trade of South America to all Nations&quot; (1701), a broader version of the Darién scheme intended to bring free trade to all of Central and South America. 
* &quot;Wednesday Club Dialogues upon the Union&quot; (1706), a series of imaginary dialogues in which Paterson expressed his beliefs that Scotland had to be guaranteed equal taxation, freedom of trade and proportionate representation in Parliament if union with England was to succeed.

==In fiction and drama==
William Paterson is the central character in Eliot Warburton&#x27;s novel, &quot;Darien, or, The Merchant Prince&quot; (1852). He also features in Douglas Galbraith&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Rising Sun&quot; (2000), and Alistair Beaton&#x27;s play, &quot;Caledonia&quot; (2010).

<doc id="417802" wikidata="Q17099625" url="?curid=417802" title="Tsymbaly">
<text>The tsymbaly () is the Ukrainian version of the hammer dulcimer. It is a chordophone made up of a trapezoidal box with metal (steel or bronze) strings strung across it. The tsymbaly is played by striking two beaters against the strings.

The strings are strung in groups of 3–5, which are tuned in unison. The bass strings may have 1 or 2 wrapped strings tuned in union. The beaters were quite short in comparison to those used by the Cymbalom although not as short as those of the Belarus variety. Traditionally they had leather wrappings rather than the cotton wrap used by Hungarian and Romanian players.

Under the Hornbostel-Sachs system of classification of musical instruments, it has the catalog number 314.122-4,5.

==History==
A small multi-stringed chordophone was first was depicted on Assyrian frescoes dating back to 3500 B.C. It is thought to have developed from the Persian santur, which entered Europe in the Middle Ages during the Crusades.

===Eastern Europe===
With the rise of piano manufacturing Vienna in the 19th century, access to metal tuning pins and strings became much easier. The &quot;hammered dulcimer&quot; became popular throughout the Austro-Hungarian Empire, where it was quickly spread by itinerant Jewish and Romani (Gypsy) musicians. It spread to Romania, Moldavia, Hungary, Slovakia, Ukraine and Belarus, where a variety of regional folk versions and concert instruments were developed. These instruments differed in size, tuning, number of strings and method of holding and playing the hammers.

===Ukraine===
According to Hnat Khotkevych, the &quot;tsymbaly&quot; has existed in Ukraine since the 9th century.
The first documented evidence of the &quot;tsymbaly&quot; in Ukraine dates to 17th century, where it appears in various dictionaries.

The &quot;tsymbaly&quot; were relatively easy to make and quite forgiving in its manufacture. With access to piano wire and metal tuning pegs, an instrument could easily be constructed in the village environment. The instrument spread in popularity among the population in the Carpathians in Southwestern Ukraine particularly among the Hutsuls and Bukovinians. It also became relatively popular in Boikivshchyna, Transcarpathia, Podolia, Bessarabia and Eastern Ukraine.

The instrument is often used in folk ensembles known as &quot;Troyista muzyka&quot;, usually made up of 3 instruments played in an ensemble with the violin, basolia, sopilka or bubon.

===Tsymbaly in the Ukrainian diaspora===

&quot;Tsymbaly&quot; playing is popular in Western Canada among the ethnic Ukrainian diaspora there. Numerous music competitions exist, and the instrument defines what &quot;Ukrainian-ness&quot; is in the local music scene.

==Types of Ukrainian Tsymbaly==

1) The Hutsul &quot;tsymbaly&quot;: a small instrument usually carried by the musician, using a strap around the player&#x27;s neck and leaning one edge of the instrument against the player&#x27;s waist. These instruments usually have 12-13 courses of strings.

2) A semi-concert &quot;tsymbaly&quot;: manufactured by the Chernihiv Musical Instrument Factory in three sizes designed by Olexander Nezovybat&#x27;ko and Ivan Skliar. These instruments were manufactured from 1950 to 1986.

3) Concert cimbaloms: originally developed in Hungary by József Schunda in the 1870s. These instruments stand on four legs, have many more strings, and a damping pedal. The concert cymbalom has replaced most of the smaller folk &quot;tsymbaly&quot; previously used in Ukrainian orchestras and in Academic Conservatory courses. These instruments are fully chromatic and have a range of over four octaves.

==Use of the Tsymbaly in Ukrainian music==

Concert works have been composed for the &quot;tsymbaly&quot; by professional Ukrainian composers V. Shumeiko, Volodymyr Zubytsky, Anatoliy Haidenko, Bohdan Kotiuk, Izydor Vymer, Dezyderiy Zador, Myroslav Skoryk and Yevhen Stankovych.

== Tsymbaly manufacturers in Ukraine ==

Among the first concert &quot;tsymbaly&quot; to be manufactured in Ukraine were made by the Melnytse-Podilsk workshop in Western Ukraine by Vasyl Zuliak. These instruments had two pedals and were slightly smaller than the concert Hungarian instruments, although the range was the same. Zuliak later made three different types of instrument.

Instruments were also made by the Chernihiv Musical Instrument Factory. These instruments were designed by Ivan Skliar aided by O. Nezovybat&#x27;ko. They were made in 3 sizes: prima, alto and bass.

==Prominent Tsymbaly players of Ukraine ==
Some notable Ukrainian &quot;tsymbaly&quot; players are:

*Taras Baran: Professor of &quot;tsymbaly&quot; at the Lviv Conservatory.
*Gheorghe Agratina: Professor of &quot;tsymbaly&quot; at the Kyiv Conservatory.
*Dumitru Popiciuc: One of the first &quot;tsymbaly&quot; graduates from the Kyiv Conservatory.
*Oleksander Nezovybatko: One of the pioneers of &quot;tsymbaly&quot; playing in Eastern Ukraine.

<doc id="417815" wikidata="Q1056429" url="?curid=417815" title="Relativistic rocket">
<text>Relativistic rocket means any spacecraft that travels close enough to light speed for relativistic effects to become significant. The meaning of &quot;significant&quot; is a matter of context, but often a threshold velocity of 30% to 50% of the speed of light (0.3&quot;c&quot; to 0.5&quot;c&quot;) is used. At 30% c, the difference between relativistic mass and rest mass is only about 5%, while at 50% it is 15%, (at 0.75&quot;c&quot; the difference is over 50%); so above such speeds special relativity is needed to accurately describe motion, while below this range Newtonian physics and the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation usually give sufficient accuracy.

In this context, a rocket is defined as an object carrying all of its reaction mass, energy, and engines with it.

No known technology can bring a rocket to relativistic speed. Relativistic rockets require huge advances in spacecraft propulsion, energy storage, and engine efficiency which may or may not ever be possible. Nuclear pulse propulsion could theoretically reach 0.1&quot;c&quot; using current known technology, but would still require many engineering advances to achieve this. The relativistic gamma factor formula_1 at 10% of light velocity is 1.005. A 0.1&quot;c&quot; speed rocket is thus considered non-relativistic since its motion is still quite accurately described by Newtonian physics alone.

Relativistic rockets are usually seen discussed in the context of interstellar travel, since most would need a lot of space to reach such speed. They are also found in some thought experiments such as the twin paradox.

==Relativistic rocket equation==
As with the classical rocket equation, one wants to calculate the velocity change formula_2 that a rocket can achieve depending on the exhaust speed formula_3 and the mass ratio, i. e. the ratio of starting rest mass formula_4 and rest mass at the end of the acceleration phase (dry mass) formula_5.

In order to make calculations simpler, we assume that the acceleration is constant (in the rocket&#x27;s reference frame) during the acceleration phase; still, the result is nonetheless valid if the acceleration varies, as long as exhaust velocity formula_3 is constant.

In the nonrelativistic case, one knows from the (classical) Tsiolkovsky rocket equation that
:formula_7
Assuming constant acceleration formula_8, the time span formula_9 during which the acceleration takes place is
:formula_10
In the relativistic case, the equation is still valid if formula_8 is the acceleration in the rocket&#x27;s reference frame and formula_9 is the rocket&#x27;s proper time because at velocity 0 the relationship between force and acceleration is the same as in the classical case. Solving this equation for the ratio of initial mass to final mass gives
:formula_13
where &quot;exp&quot; is the exponential function. Another related equation gives the mass ratio in terms of the end velocity formula_2 relative to the rest frame (i. e. the frame of the rocket before the acceleration phase):
:formula_15
For constant acceleration, formula_16 (with a and t again measured on board the rocket), so substituting this equation into the previous one and using the hyperbolic function identity formula_17 returns the earlier equation formula_18.

By applying the Lorentz transformation, one can calculate the end velocity formula_2 as a function of the rocket frame acceleration and the rest frame time formula_20; the result is
:formula_21
The time in the rest frame relates to the proper time by the hyperbolic motion equation:
:formula_22
Substituting the proper time from the Tsiolkovsky equation and substituting the resulting rest frame time in the expression for formula_2, one gets the desired formula:
:formula_24
The formula for the corresponding rapidity (the inverse hyperbolic tangent of the velocity divided by the speed of light) is simpler:
:formula_25
Since rapidities, contrary to velocities, are additive, they are useful for computing the total formula_2 of a multistage rocket.

==Matter-antimatter annihilation rockets==
It is clear from the above calculations that a relativistic rocket would likely need to be antimatter-fired. Other antimatter rockets in addition to the photon rocket that can provide a 0.6&quot;c&quot; specific impulse (studied for basic hydrogen-antihydrogen annihilation, no ionization, no recycling of the radiation) needed for interstellar flight include the &quot;beam core&quot; pion rocket. In a pion rocket, frozen antihydrogen is stored inside electromagnetic bottles. Antihydrogen, like regular hydrogen, is diamagnetic which allows it to be electromagnetically levitated when refrigerated. Temperature control of the storage volume is used to determine the rate of vaporization of the frozen antihydrogen, up to a few grams per second (hence several petawatts when annihilated with equal amounts of matter). It is then ionized into antiprotons which can be electromagnetically accelerated into the reaction chamber. The positrons are usually discarded since their annihilation only produces harmful gamma rays with negligible effect on thrust. However, non-relativistic rockets may exclusively rely on these gamma rays for propulsion. This process is necessary because un-neutralized antiprotons repel one another, limiting the number that may be stored with current technology to less than a trillion.

===Design notes on a pion rocket===
The pion rocket has been studied independently by Robert Frisbee and Ulrich Walter, with similar results. Pions, short for pi-mesons, are produced by proton-antiproton annihilation. The antihydrogen or the antiprotons extracted from it will be mixed with a mass of regular protons pumped into the magnetic confinement nozzle of a pion rocket engine, usually as part of hydrogen atoms. The resulting charged pions have a speed of 0.94&quot;c&quot; (i.e. formula_27 = 0.94), and a Lorentz factor formula_1 of 2.93 which extends their lifespan enough to travel 21 meters through the nozzle before decaying into muons. 60% of the pions will have either a negative, or a positive electric charge. 40% of the pions will be neutral. The neutral pions decay immediately into gamma rays. These can&#x27;t be reflected by any known material at the energies involved, though they can undergo Compton scattering. They can be absorbed efficiently by a shield of tungsten placed between the pion rocket engine reaction volume and the crew modules and various electromagnets to protect them from the gamma rays. The consequent heating of the shield will make it radiate visible light, which could then be collimated to increase the rocket&#x27;s specific impulse. The remaining heat will also require the shield to be refrigerated. The charged pions would travel in helical spirals around the axial electromagnetic field lines inside the nozzle and in this way the charged pions could be collimated into an exhaust jet moving at 0.94&quot;c&quot;. In realistic matter/antimatter reactions, this jet only represents a fraction of the reaction&#x27;s mass-energy: over 60% of it is lost as gamma-rays, collimation is not perfect, and some pions are not reflected backward by the nozzle. Thus, the effective exhaust speed for the entire reaction drops to just 0.58c. Alternate propulsion schemes include physical confinement of hydrogen atoms in an antiproton and pion-transparent beryllium reaction chamber with collimation of the reaction products achieved with a single external electromagnet; see Project Valkyrie.

<doc id="417819" wikidata="Q8374" url="?curid=417819" title="Cimbalom">
<text>The cimbalom, cimbal (; ) or concert cimbalom is a type of chordophone composed of a large, trapezoidal box on legs with metal strings stretched across its top and a damping pedal underneath. It was designed and created by V. Josef Schunda in 1874 in Budapest, based on his modifications to the existing hammered dulcimer instruments which were already present in Central and Eastern Europe.

Today the instrument is mainly played in Hungary, Slovakia, Moravia, Belarus, Romania, Moldova, and Ukraine.

The cimbalom is typically played by striking two sticks, often with cotton-wound tips, against the strings which are on the top of the instrument. The steel treble strings are arranged in groups of 4 and are tuned in unison. The bass strings which are over-spun with copper, are arranged in groups of 3 and are also tuned in unison. The Hornbostel–Sachs musical instrument classification system registers the cimbalom with the number 314.122-4,5.

The name “cimbalom” is also sometimes used to describe other types of dulcimers, which may have different tuning systems and which may lack the dampers and heavy construction of the concert instrument. Additionally, &quot;cimbal&quot; has many alternate spellings; e.g., &quot;tsimbal&quot;, in Romanian, or [tsymbaly] in Ukrainian).

==History==
 
The modern Hungarian concert cimbalom was designed and created by V. Josef Schunda in 1874 in Budapest based on his modifications to existing folk dulcimers. He demonstrated an early prototype with some improvements at the 1873 Vienna World&#x27;s Fair, gaining praise from audiences and drawing the attention of highly-placed Hungarian politicians such as József Zichy, Gyula Andrássy, and King Franz Joseph. He then continued to work to modify and improve his design. He extended the length of the strings and redesigned the position of the bridges to improve the tone and musical range. He added heavy dampers which would allow a greater degree of control over the ringing of the strings, and a metal brace inside the instrument which would increase its stability. Four detachable legs were added to support this much larger instrument; its folkloric predecessors had usually been played on a barrel or table.

Schunda began serial production of his concert cimbalom in 1874, manufacturing them in a piano shop located on Hajós utca, across the street from the Budapest Opera House in Pest. He also started to develop a playing method and school to popularize his new instrument, eventually recruiting Géza Allaga, a prominent musician and pedagogue, to publish method books. Prominent Hungarian musicians such as Franz Liszt became increasingly interested in the instrument and its possibilities. The instrument quickly became popular among the Bourgeoisie as well as Roma musicians, and by 1906 Schunda had produced over ten thousand instruments.

Walter Zev Feldman took to reintroducing the instrument for Jewish folk music and derivatives in the 1970s.

==Characteristics==
Concert instruments from Schunda onward are fully chromatic. The Schunda tuning system established a standard pitch range of four octaves plus a major 3rd; extending from C to e′′′ (Helmholtz pitch notation). The cimbalom has continued its development and modern concert instruments are often further expanded and have numerous refinements beyond Schunda&#x27;s design. These instruments can now have a pitch range that extends five fully chromatic octaves from AA to a′′′.

Contemporary cimbalom makers also create smaller instruments. These run the gamut from less weighty versions of Schunda&#x27;s original concert layout to truly portable fully chromatic cimbaloms (which use Schunda&#x27;s signature tuning pattern and note layout but with reduced range in the bass). Modern makers also continue to craft new and traditional folk style instruments.

A smaller more portable version of the concert cimbalom was produced in Ukraine from the 1950s to the 1980s that came with detachable legs and dampers, but could be carried more easily than the larger concert instrument. These instruments were produced by the Chernihiv factory and the Melnytso-Podilsk folk instruments workshop which also produced many types of other folk instruments.

==Compositions for cimbalom==

===Classical and contemporary music===
Many composers have written for the cimbalom. Zoltán Kodály made extensive use of the instrument in his orchestral suite &quot;Háry János&quot; which helped make the cimbalom known outside Eastern Europe. Igor Stravinsky was also an enthusiast. He owned a cimbalom which he purchased after hearing Aladár Rácz perform on the instrument. He included the cimbalom in his ballet &quot;Renard&quot; (1915–16), his &quot;Ragtime&quot; for eleven instruments, his original (1917) scoring for &quot;Les Noces&quot;, and his &quot;Four Russian Songs&quot;. Franz Liszt used the cimbalom in his &quot;Ungarischer Sturmmarsch&quot; (1876) and in the orchestral version of his &quot;Hungarian Rhapsody No. 6&quot;. Béla Bartók used it in his &quot;Rhapsody No. 1 for violin and orchestra&quot; (1928).

More recently, other composers including Pierre Boulez, Peter Maxwell Davies, Peter Eötvös, György Kurtág, Miklós Kocsár, Richard Grimes, Louis Andriessen, and Peter Machajdík have made a great use of cimbalom in their works. Henri Dutilleux used it extensively in &quot;Mystère de l&#x27;Instant&quot; for chamber orchestra, and &quot;L&#x27;arbre des songes&quot; for violin &amp; orchestra. Elvis Costello&#x27;s orchestral ballet score &quot;Il Sogno&quot; includes several extended cimbalom passages. Harrison Birtwistle&#x27;s operas &quot;&quot;Gawain&quot;&quot; (1991) and &quot;&quot;The Minotaur&quot;&quot; (2008) each utilize the cimbalom. John Adams uses the instrument prominently in his large 2012 symphonic oratorio &quot;The Gospel According to the Other Mary&quot; as well as in his 2014 dramatic symphony &quot;Scheherazade.2&quot;. Cimbalom is used in a popular arrangement of Debussy&#x27;s &quot;La plus que lente&quot; which the composer approved but did not actually score. (&quot;La plus que lente&quot; with cimbalom saw renewed popularity with its inclusion in world tours of the Hundred Gypsy Violins starting in 1985.)

=== Film and television ===
The cimbalom has occasionally been used in film scores, especially to introduce a &quot;foreign&quot; feel. The cimbalom appears in &quot;Christmas in Connecticut&quot; (1945) in a scene in Felix&#x27;s (S. Z. Sakall) Hungarian restaurant in Manhattan. It was also featured in the films &quot;Captain Blood&quot; (1935), &quot;The Divorce of Lady X&quot; (1938), and &quot;Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon&quot; (1943).

The cimbalom was used in the film score for the movie &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; (1967). Composer Carmine Coppola made heavy use of the cimbalom in his soundtrack for &quot;The Black Stallion&quot; (1979) to accentuate the Arabian heritage of the majestic horse. Miklós Rózsa used the cimbalom in the main theme and throughout the score for the science-fiction thriller &quot;The Power&quot; (1968). John Barry used it in the title theme for the film &quot;The Ipcress File&quot; (1965), as well as in the main theme of the ITC TV series &quot;The Persuaders!&quot; (1971); in both examples the performer was John Leach. James Horner made use of the instrument in his &quot;Stealing the Enterprise&quot; cue from &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; (1984). In addition, John Williams has made less prominent use of the instrument in scores such as &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981). Howard Shore used the cimbalom as well to express Gollum&#x27;s sneaky nature in Peter Jackson&#x27;s film &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot; (2002). The cimbalom is also featured prominently in Hans Zimmer&#x27;s scoring of &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; (2009). Alexandre Desplat uses cimbalom in works such as &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; (2007), &quot;The Curious Case of Benjamin Button&quot; (2008), and &quot;The Grand Budapest Hotel&quot; (2014).

In television, composer Lalo Schifrin made use of the cimbalom in several scores he wrote for the original &quot;&quot; television series, from which several cues were regularly recycled throughout the series&#x27; run.

Composer Debbie Wiseman used the cimbalom, played by Greg Knowles, in her score for the BBC television series &#x27;Dickensian&#x27; (2015–16).

The cimbalom, played by John Leach, features prominently in the score of the BBC television drama serial from 1988, &#x27;Babylon Bypassed&#x27; by Gareth Glyn. 

===Rock===
The cimbalom was used by Alan Parsons on his &quot;I Robot&quot; and &quot;Tales of Mystery and Imagination&quot; albums and is included in the guest musician acknowledgments. The experimental rock group Mr. Bungle made use of the cimbalom on the &quot;Disco Volante&quot; and &quot;California&quot; albums. It is included in the guest musician acknowledgments. The experimental performance organization Blue Man Group has used a cimbalom in its productions. American progressive chamber group, cordis, uses electric and acoustic cimbalom as a centerpiece in their music. Romanian rock group Spitalul de Urgență has frequently used cimbalom, including a full-time player in some line-ups of the band. New York multi-instrumentalist Rob Burger used a cimbalom on the album &quot;L&#x27;Entredeux&quot; (2008) by Tucson chanteuse Marianne Dissard. Alternative rock band Garbage incorporated cimbalom into their track &quot;The Trick Is to Keep Breathing&quot; from their 1998 album &quot;Version 2.0&quot;. Portishead have long been successful pioneers of the cimbalom or hammered dulcimer in their groundbreaking work since formation in 1991.

==Schools of performance==

===Belarus===
In Belarus a cymbaly school was established in 1948 by J. Zynovych. The Belarusian cymbaly differs from the concert cimbalom in timbre and size—it is smaller and produces a sweeter, more mellow tone. Also, pedal dampers are not typically used. Instead, hands and fingers are used to damp the strings.

===Croatia===
The cimbal (or cimbule) today is a rare instrument found in folk groups (Međimurje, Zagorje and Podravina regions - parts of northern Croatia near Hungarian border).
===Moravia===
The instrument is used foremost in the historical region of Moravia as a basis for Moravian traditional music ensembles. Foremost in regions of Moravian Slovakia and Moravian Wallachia.

===France===
Luigi Gaggero teaches since 2004 at the Conservatoire de Strasbourg and at the Académie Supérieure de Musique de Strasbourg. His teaching focuses on classical and on contemporary repertoire for cimbalom.

===Greece===
In Athens, a cimbalom school was established in 2004 by M. Papadeas. The Greek musicians play on small portable folk style instruments.

===Hungary===
Besides the main cimbalom centre in Budapest, there is a very strong school of performance in Debrecen in Hungary.

===Moldova===
In 1952, cimbalom classes were opened at the Chişinău conservatory in Moldova.

===Romania===
A strong performance school was established in Bucharest. Toni Iordache, a Romani-Romanian &quot;lăutar&quot;, was the most famous Romanian cimbalom player.

===Slovakia===
The cimbal is a very popular instrument found in all Slovak regions, as well as in the ethnically Slovak/Hungarian mixed southern regions and among Romani folk ensembles.

Slovenia

Used historically in the Prekmurje region. Cimbalom is traditionally played in musical groups called Banda, accompanied by two violins, a viola, violoncello and a double bass. Classes are held in town of Beltinci.

===Ukraine===

In Ukraine, the concert Cimbalom was first formally used in the Orchestra of Ukrainian Folk Instruments organized and directed by Leonid Haydamaka from 1922 by Oleksandr Nezovybatko. In time it was replaced by 2 smaller-sized instruments in order to facilitate transportation. Music for the cimbalom has been published in Ukraine from 1930 on. With the serial manufacture of &quot;tsymbaly&quot; by the Chernihiv Musical Instrument Factory cimbalom playing became popular in Eastern Ukraine in the post war years. Textbooks for the &quot;tsymbaly&quot; were published in 1966 by O. Nezovybatko, and initially players played on semi-concert instruments manufactured by the Chernihiv Musical Instrument Factory. In recent times most professional performers have switched over to the Schunda system of playing on concert-size instruments. Classes for the instrument exist in the Lviv, Kyiv and Kharkiv conservatories. Currently most Ukraine folk instrument ensembles and orchestras such as the Orchestra of Ukrainian Folk instruments and the State Bandurist Capella usually have 2 concert cimbaloms. Roman Kumlyk was a famous player from Hutsul area. After his death, a museum was named for him and is now run by his family.

All of them were initially delivered as lectures to academics, with the exception of &quot;On Translating &quot;Beowulf&quot;, which Christopher Tolkien notes in his foreword is not addressed to an academic audience.

==Essays==

<doc id="417829" wikidata="Q6605560" url="?curid=417829" title="List of all-female bands">
<text>This is an alphabetized list of notable all-female bands, of all genres, and is a spin-off list from the all-female band article. It is an overview of notable all-female bands that have their own articles. A band is a group of musicians who are organized for ensemble playing. An all-female band is a band which has consisted entirely of female musicians for at least three-quarters of its active career. 

This article only lists all-female bands who perform original material that is either authored by themselves or authored by another musician for that band&#x27;s use. Therefore vocal groups (girl groups) are not included. All-female tribute acts, cover bands and fictional all-female bands, such as those created for scripted television programs, are also not included.

<text>Fanny was an American rock band, active in the early to mid 1970s. They were one of the first all-female rock groups to achieve critical and commercial success, including two &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Top 40 singles.

The group was founded by sisters June and Jean Millington (on guitar and bass respectively), who had been playing music together since they moved from the Philippines to California in the early 1960s. After playing through several variations of the band, they attracted the interest of producer Richard Perry who signed them to Reprise Records in 1969 as Fanny. The band recorded four albums together before June quit the group, leading to the original line-up splitting. Following a final album, Fanny disbanded in 1975. The Millington sisters have continued to play music together since the split, and with a former drummer, Brie Howard-Darling, formed the spin-off group Fanny Walked the Earth in 2018.

The group had attracted critical acclaim for rejecting typical girl group styles and expectations of women in the rock industry, and emphasizing their musical skills. Later groups such as the Go-Go&#x27;s, the Bangles, and the Runaways cited Fanny as a key influence.

==Career==
Sisters June and Jean Millington moved with their family from the Philippines to Sacramento, California, in 1961. They began to play music together on ukuleles, which helped them gain friends. In high school they formed an all-female band called the Svelts with June on guitar, Jean on bass, Addie Lee on guitar, and Brie Brandt on drums. Brandt left to get married and was later replaced by Alice de Buhr.

Lee and de Buhr later formed another all-female band, Wild Honey. The Millington sisters later joined this band as well. Wild Honey played Motown covers and eventually moved to Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=&quot;msmagazine/Fanny&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dailynews/female-rock&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Frustrated by a lack of success or respect in the male-dominated rock scene, Wild Honey decided to disband after one final open-mic appearance at the Troubadour Club in Los Angeles in 1969. They were spotted at this gig by the secretary of producer Richard Perry, who had been searching for an all-female rock band to mentor.

Perry convinced Warner Bros. Records to sign the band, still known as Wild Honey, to Reprise Records. The group won the contract without the label hearing them play, on the grounds of being a novelty act, despite their genuine musical talent.&lt;ref name=&quot;teentalkingcircles/Wolf/June&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Warner Bros. installed the band in a rented mansion formerly owned by Hedy Lamarr, on Marmont Lane near Sunset Boulevard. Prior to recording their first album, the band recruited keyboardist Nickey Barclay while bringing in early Svelts member Brie Brandt.

The band was then renamed Fanny, not with a sexual connotation but to denote a female spirit. The initial lineup consisted of June on guitar, Jean on bass, de Buhr on drums, Barclay on keyboards, and Brandt on lead vocals and percussion. Perry dismissed Brandt because he wanted the group to be a self-contained four-piece band like the Beatles. The Millingtons and Barclay all assumed lead vocal duties on alternating songs, while de Buhr sang lead occasionally on later albums.

Perry produced the band&#x27;s first three albums, beginning with &quot;Fanny&quot; in 1970. Because of the connection to Perry and Reprise Records, Barclay was invited to tour with Joe Cocker as a backing singer, and consequently appeared on the album &quot;Mad Dogs and Englishmen&quot;. The group&#x27;s cover of Cream&#x27;s &quot;Badge&quot; from the first album earned significant radio airplay. The follow-up album, &quot;Charity Ball&quot;, was released the following year and its title track reached number 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The members of Fanny also worked as session musicians, and played on Barbra Streisand&#x27;s 1971 album &quot;Barbra Joan Streisand&quot;, because Streisand had wanted to record with a small band.

The group continued to pick up well-known fans; David Bowie sent the group a letter admiring their work and invited the band to a post-show party where he showed them mime techniques. With young engineer Leslie Ann Jones as their road manager and live sound mixer, Fanny toured worldwide, opening for Slade, Jethro Tull and Humble Pie, gaining widespread popularity in the United Kingdom. A 1971 article in &quot;Sounds&quot; remarked that the group &quot;seems that they are the support group to everyone these days&quot;. The group made several live television appearances during tours, including &quot;The Sonny and Cher Show&quot;, &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; and &quot;Beat-Club&quot;.

The group&#x27;s third album, &quot;Fanny Hill&quot; (1972) featured the Beatles&#x27; engineer Geoff Emerick in addition to Perry&#x27;s production. It included covers of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Hey Bulldog&quot; and Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;Ain&#x27;t That Peculiar&quot;. The latter featured regular Rolling Stones saxophonist Bobby Keys, and was released as a single, reaching number 85 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Fellow Stones sideman Jim Price also played brass on the album. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote a rave review of the album, praising the group&#x27;s musical skills and particularly June&#x27;s ability to play both lead and rhythm guitar.

Their fourth album, &quot;Mothers Pride&quot; (1973), was produced by Todd Rundgren. By the time &quot;Mothers Pride&quot; was released, June was feeling constrained by the group format. The record label wanted her to wear certain designer clothes and adopt a hard rock image, which she resisted. She decided to quit the group, later saying &quot;I needed to figure out who I was&quot; while she regularly clashed with Barclay due to conflicting personalities. June moved to Woodstock, New York to study Buddhism, but insisted that the group continue without her.

De Buhr also left the band, with a returning Brandt replacing her on drums. Patti Quatro (sister of Suzi Quatro) replaced June on guitar. This lineup signed with Casablanca Records and released the final Fanny album, &quot;Rock and Roll Survivors&quot;, in 1974. The first single, &quot;I&#x27;ve Had It&quot; reached number 79 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Brandt left the band shortly after the album&#x27;s completion when she married composer James Newton Howard, and was briefly replaced by Cam Davis. Barclay quit the group at the end of 1974 to pursue other interests. Concurrently, the album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Butter Boy&quot;, written by Jean about Bowie, became their biggest hit, reaching number 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in April 1975. By the time that single was released, the group had split.

==Post-split activities==
After the breakup in 1975, the Millington sisters put together a new line-up of Fanny for a short tour, though no older Fanny material was played. This group ultimately morphed into a renamed all-women band called the L.A. All-Stars. Some interest was shown by record labels who stipulated that the band tour as Fanny and play only Fanny songs, which June opposed. This ended the chance of a Fanny reunion.

June subsequently released three solo albums in the 1980s and has had a career as a producer for artists including Holly Near, Cris Williamson and Bitch and Animal. She operates the Institute for Musical Arts, a non-profit organization supporting girls and women in music. Jean was married to Bowie&#x27;s guitarist Earl Slick for a time and later became an herbalist. The Millingtons continued to record together after Fanny as well, most recently on the 2011 album &quot;Play Like a Girl&quot; on June&#x27;s label Fabulous Records. Nickey Barclay released a solo album titled &quot;Diamond in a Junkyard&quot; in 1976 then withdrew from the music industry. De Buhr later worked in marketing for several major record labels, and promoted the Go-Go&#x27;s, who cited Fanny as an influence. She collaborated with Real Gone Music in a reissue program for the group&#x27;s albums.

Patti Quatro continued to work as a session musician for her sister Suzi and was involved in the reissue of material by the Quatro sisters&#x27; early band the Pleasure Seekers. Brie Brandt, later known as Brie Howard-Darling and currently as Brie Darling, had an active post-Fanny career, fronting the bands American Girls, which released one album in 1986, and Boxing Gandhis, which has released four albums since the mid-1990s. She has also acted in films such as 1982&#x27;s &quot;Android&quot; and is the mother of Playboy Playmate Brandi Brandt. Quatro and Brandt both toured with Electric Light Orchestra and appeared on the album &quot;A New World Record&quot; in 1976.

In 2002, Rhino Records released the limited edition 4-CD box set &quot;First Time in a Long Time&quot;, which collected Fanny&#x27;s first four studio albums along with live recordings, outtakes, and promotional items. A reunion concert featuring the Millington sisters and de Buhr (Barclay declined to appear for health reasons) was held at Berklee College of Music on April 20, 2007, where the band members received the &quot;ROCKRGRL&quot; Women of Valor award for their achievements. The first four original Fanny albums are available on Real Gone records, with updated liner notes, pictures, and new mixes.

In 2016, Brie Howard joined a live performance by the Millington sisters. This inspired the formation of a new band called Fanny Walked the Earth. An album also titled &quot;Fanny Walked the Earth&quot; was released in March 2018. The album marks the first time June, Jean, and Brie all recorded at the same time in nearly 50 years.

Fanny were the subject of the documentary film &quot;&quot;, released in 2021 and directed by Bobbi Jo Hart. Fanny performed at Yerba Buena Gardens on May 20, 2023.

==Musical style and legacy==
Fanny was not the first all-female rock band to sign with a major label, coming after Goldie and the Gingerbreads and the Pleasure Seekers. However, the earlier groups released only singles, so Fanny were the first all-female ensemble to release a full-length album on a major label and one of the first to achieve top 40 success on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Fanny&#x27;s music was influenced by the Beatles and the Funk Brothers, the loose studio musician collective on Motown records.

The band resisted suggestions by the record company to dress in a typical girl group style or emphasize any sex appeal; the band also rehearsed regularly, wanting to acquire a reputation based on their musical talent. Jean later said that Fanny had to have a strong live presence in order to overcome audience&#x27;s perceptions that women could not play rock music well. June added, &quot;We knew we had to prove we could play and deliver live. Otherwise, no one would believe it.&quot; 

The group were more successful in the UK and Europe, where audiences appreciated their music and respected their work, than in the US. De Buhr was disappointed to discover that some record company executives merely treated Fanny as a gimmick that should not be taken seriously. Promoter Bill Graham was reluctant to give the group a headlining slot at venues, for fear the group would split up as the members got married and had children, though the group have stressed this was due to business pragmatics and not chauvinism. During tours, female fans would ask the group how to form a band. Later all-female bands such as the Runaways and the Bangles cited Fanny as a key influence.

A retrospective review of the group&#x27;s career in &quot;Rebeat&quot; stressed that Fanny were simply a good band, irrespective of gender. June has been praised for her guitar skills, and was described by &quot;Guitar Player&quot; as the hottest female guitar player in the music industry. During her time in Fanny, she initially favored the Gibson ES-355 and Fender Twin Reverb amp, before acquiring a Gibson Les Paul Junior guitar and Traynor amplifiers. She used the Les Paul primarily for slide guitar playing. Jean&#x27;s main instrument in Fanny was a 1963 Fender Precision Bass, which is still in her possession.

Little Feat bandleader Lowell George was a fan of Fanny and jammed with the group when they were in Los Angeles. In a 1999 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, David Bowie revealed his respect for the band: 
They were one of the finest fucking rock bands of their time, in about 1973. They were extraordinary: they wrote everything, they played like motherfuckers, they were just colossal and wonderful, and nobody&#x27;s ever mentioned them. They&#x27;re as important as anybody else who&#x27;s ever been, ever; it just wasn&#x27;t their time.

<text>Elisha Gray (August 2, 1835 – January 21, 1901) was an American electrical engineer who co-founded the Western Electric Manufacturing Company. Gray is best known for his development of a telephone prototype in 1876 in Highland Park, Illinois. Some recent authors have argued that Gray should be considered the true inventor of the telephone because Alexander Graham Bell allegedly stole the idea of the liquid transmitter from him. Although Gray had been using liquid transmitters in his telephone experiments for more than two years previously, Bell&#x27;s telephone patent was upheld in numerous court decisions.

Gray is also considered to be the father of the modern music synthesizer, and was granted over 70 patents for his inventions. He was one of the founders of Graybar, purchasing a controlling interest in the company shortly after its inception.

== Biography and early inventions ==
Gray was born in Barnesville, Ohio, the son of Christiana (Edgerton) and David Gray. His family were Quakers. He was brought up on a farm. He spent several years at Oberlin College where he experimented with electrical devices. Although Gray did not graduate, he taught electricity and science there and built laboratory equipment for its science departments.

In 1862, while at Oberlin, Gray met and married Delia Minerva Shepard.

In 1865, Gray invented a self-adjusting telegraph relay that automatically adapted to varying insulation of the telegraph line. In 1867 Gray received a patent for the invention, the first of more than seventy.

In 1869, Elisha Gray and his partner Enos M. Barton founded Gray &amp; Barton Co. in Cleveland, Ohio to supply telegraph equipment to the giant Western Union Telegraph Company. The electrical distribution business was later spun off and organized into a separate company, Graybar Electric Company, Inc. Barton was employed by Western Union to examine and test new products.

In 1870, financing for Gray &amp; Barton Co. was arranged by General Anson Stager, a superintendent of the Western Union Telegraph Company. Stager became an active partner in Gray &amp; Barton Co. and remained on the board of directors. The company moved to Chicago near Highland Park. Gray later gave up his administrative position as chief engineer to focus on inventions that could benefit the telegraph industry. Gray&#x27;s inventions and patent costs were financed by a dentist, Dr. Samuel S. White of Philadelphia, who had made a fortune producing porcelain teeth. White wanted Gray to focus on the acoustic telegraph which promised huge profits instead of what appeared to be unpromising competing inventions such as the telephone. White made the decision in 1876 to redirect Gray&#x27;s interest in the telephone.

In 1870, Gray developed a needle annunciator for hotels and another for elevators. He also developed a microphone printer which had a typewriter keyboard and printed messages on paper tape.

In 1871 the Great Chicago Fire destroyed the city and its telegraph infrastructure, Gray &amp; Barton was hired to rebuild it. In 1872, Western Union, then financed by the Vanderbilts and J. P. Morgan, bought one-third of Gray and Barton Co. and changed the name to Western Electric Manufacturing Company of Chicago. Gray continued to invent for Western Electric.

In 1874, Gray retired to do independent research and development. Gray applied for a patent on a harmonic telegraph which consisted of multi-tone transmitters, that controlled each tone with a separate telegraph key. Gray gave several private demonstrations of this invention in New York and Washington, D.C. in May and June 1874.

Gray was a charter member of the Presbyterian Church in Highland Park, Illinois. At the church, on December 29, 1874, Gray gave the first public demonstration of his invention for transmitting musical tones and transmitted &quot;familiar melodies through telegraph wire&quot; according to a newspaper announcement. This was one of the earliest electric musical instruments using vibrating electromagnetic circuits that were single-note oscillators operated by a two-octave piano keyboard. The &quot;Musical Telegraph&quot; used steel reeds whose oscillations were created by electromagnets and transmitted over a telegraph wire. Gray also built a simple loudspeaker in later models consisting of a vibrating diaphragm in a magnetic field to make the oscillator tones audible and louder at the receiving end. In 1900 Gray worked on an underwater signaling device. After his death in 1901 officials gave the invention to Oberlin College. A few years later he was recognized as the inventor of the underwater signaling device.

On July 27, 1875, Gray was granted for &quot;Electric Telegraph for Transmitting Musical Tones&quot; (acoustic telegraphy). His experiments with transmitting musical tones went further, and on February 15, 1876 Elisha Gray was granted US Patent for electro-harmonic telegraph with piano keyboard.

He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1878.

On July 31, 1888, Gray patented the telautograph, an analog precursor to the modern fax machine. Gray&#x27;s patent stated that the telautograph would allow &quot;one to transmit his own handwriting to a distant point over a two-wire circuit.&quot; It was the first facsimile machine in which the stylus was controlled by horizontal and vertical bars. The telautograph was first publicly exhibited at the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition held in Chicago.

== Telephone ==

Because of Samuel White&#x27;s opposition to Gray working on the telephone, Gray did not tell anybody about his invention for transmitting voice sounds until February 11, 1876 (Friday). The only remaining proof is a drawing he made on that day. Gray requested that his patent lawyer William D. Baldwin prepare a &quot;caveat&quot; for filing at the US Patent Office. A caveat was like a provisional patent application with drawings and description but without a request for examination.

On Monday morning February 14, 1876, Gray signed and had notarized the caveat that described a telephone that used a liquid transmitter. Baldwin then submitted the caveat to the US Patent Office. That same morning a lawyer for Alexander Graham Bell submitted Bell&#x27;s patent application. Which application arrived first is hotly disputed, although Gray believed that his caveat arrived a few hours &quot;before&quot; Bell&#x27;s application. Bell&#x27;s lawyers in Washington, DC, had been waiting with Bell&#x27;s patent application for months, under instructions not to file it in the USA until it had been filed in Britain first. (At the time, Britain would only issue patents on discoveries not previously patented elsewhere.)

According to Evenson, during the weekend of February 12–14, 1876, before either caveat or application had been filed in the patent office, Bell&#x27;s lawyer learned about the liquid transmitter idea in Gray&#x27;s caveat that would be filed early Monday morning February 14. Bell&#x27;s lawyer then added seven sentences describing the liquid transmitter and a variable resistance claim to Bell&#x27;s draft application. After the lawyer&#x27;s clerk recopied the draft as a finished patent application, Bell&#x27;s lawyer hand-delivered the finished application to the patent office just before noon Monday, a few hours after Gray&#x27;s caveat was delivered by Gray&#x27;s lawyer. Bell&#x27;s lawyer requested that Bell&#x27;s application be immediately recorded and hand-delivered to the examiner on Monday so that later Bell could claim it had arrived first. Bell was in Boston at this time and was not aware that his application had been filed.

Five days later, on February 19, Zenas Fisk Wilber, the patent examiner for both Bell&#x27;s application and Gray&#x27;s caveat, noticed that Bell&#x27;s application claimed the same variable resistance feature described in Gray&#x27;s caveat. Wilber suspended Bell&#x27;s application for 90 days to give Gray time to submit a competing patent application. The suspension also gave Bell time to amend his claims to avoid an interference with an earlier patent application of Gray&#x27;s that mentioned changing the intensity of the electric current without breaking the circuit, which seemed to the examiner to be an &quot;undulatory current&quot; that Bell was claiming. Such an interference would delay Bell&#x27;s application until Bell submitted proof, under the first to invent rules, that Bell had invented that feature before Gray.

Bell&#x27;s lawyer telegraphed Bell, who was still in Boston, to come to Washington, DC. When Bell arrived on February 26, Bell visited his lawyers and then visited examiner Wilber who told Bell that Gray&#x27;s caveat showed a liquid transmitter and asked Bell for proof that the liquid transmitter idea (described in Bell&#x27;s patent application as using mercury as the liquid) was invented by Bell. Bell pointed to an application of Bell&#x27;s filed a year earlier where mercury was used in a circuit breaker. The examiner accepted this argument, although mercury would not have worked in a telephone transmitter. On February 29, Bell&#x27;s lawyer submitted an amendment to Bell&#x27;s claims that distinguished them from Gray&#x27;s caveat and Gray&#x27;s earlier application. On March 3, Wilber approved Bell&#x27;s application and on March 7, 1876, 174,465 was published by the U.S. Patent Office.

Bell returned to Boston and resumed work on March 9, drawing a diagram in his lab notebook of a water transmitter being used face down, very similar to that shown in Gray&#x27;s caveat. Bell and Watson built and tested a liquid transmitter design on March 10 and successfully transmitted clear speech saying &quot;Mr. Watson – come here – I want to see you.&quot; Bell&#x27;s notebooks became public when they were donated to the Library of Congress in 1976.

Although Bell has been accused of stealing the telephone from Gray because his liquid transmitter design resembled Gray&#x27;s, documents in the Library of Congress indicate that Bell had been using liquid transmitters extensively for three years in his multiple telegraph and other experiments. In April, 1875, ten months before the alleged theft of Gray&#x27;s design, the U.S. Patent Office granted 161,739 to Bell for a primitive fax machine, which he called the &quot;autograph telegraph.&quot; The patent drawing includes liquid transmitters.

After March 1876, Bell and Watson focused on improving the electromagnetic telephone and never used Gray&#x27;s liquid transmitter in public demonstrations or commercial use.

Although Gray had abandoned his caveat, Gray applied for a patent for the same invention in late 1877. This put him in a second interference with Bell&#x27;s patents. The Patent Office determined, &quot;while Gray was undoubtedly the first to conceive of and disclose the [variable resistance] invention, as in his caveat of February 14, 1876, his failure to take any action amounting to completion until others had demonstrated the utility of the invention deprives him of the right to have it considered.&quot; Gray challenged Bell&#x27;s patent anyway, and after two years of litigation, Bell was awarded rights to the invention, and as a result, Bell is credited as the inventor.

In 1886, Wilber stated in an affidavit that he was an alcoholic and deeply in debt to Bell&#x27;s lawyer Marcellus Bailey with whom Wilber had served in the Civil War. Wilber stated that, contrary to Patent Office rules, he showed Bailey the caveat Gray had filed. He also stated that he showed the caveat to Bell and Bell gave him $100. Bell testified that they only discussed the patent in general terms, although in a letter to Gray, Bell admitted that he learned some of the technical details. Wilber&#x27;s affidavit contradicted his earlier testimony, and historians have pointed out that his last affidavit was drafted for him by the attorneys for the Pan-Electric Company which was attempting to steal the Bell patents and was later discovered to have bribed the U.S. Attorney General Augustus Garland and several Congressmen.

Bell&#x27;s patent was disputed in 1888 by attorney Lysander Hill who accused Wilber of allowing Bell or his lawyer Pollok to add a handwritten margin note of seven sentences to Bell&#x27;s application that describe an alternate design similar to Gray&#x27;s liquid microphone design. However, the marginal note was added only to Bell&#x27;s earlier draft, not to his patent application that shows the seven sentences already present in a paragraph. Bell testified that he added those seven sentences in the margin of an earlier draft of his application &quot;almost at the last moment before sending it off to Washington&quot; to his lawyers. Bell or his lawyer could not have added the seven sentences to the application after it was filed in the Patent Office, because then the application would not have been suspended.

== Further inventions ==
In 1887, Gray invented the telautograph, a device that could remotely transmit handwriting through telegraph systems. Gray was granted several patents for these pioneer fax machines, and the Gray National Telautograph Company was chartered in 1888 and continued in business as The Telautograph Corporation for many years; after a series of mergers it was finally absorbed by Xerox in the 1990s. Gray&#x27;s telautograph machines were used by banks for signing documents at a distance and by the military for sending written commands during gun tests when the deafening noise from the guns made spoken orders on the telephone impractical. The machines were also used at train stations for schedule changes.

Gray displayed his telautograph invention in 1893 at the 1893 Columbian Exposition and sold his share in the telautograph shortly after that. Gray was also chairman of the International Congress of Electricians at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition of 1893.

Gray conceived of a primitive closed-circuit television system that he called the &quot;telephone&quot;. Pictures would be focused on an array of selenium cells and signals from the selenium cells would be transmitted to a distant station on separate wires. At the receiving end, each wire would open or close a shutter to recreate the image.

In 1899, Gray moved to Boston where he continued inventing. One of his projects was to develop an underwater signaling device to transmit messages to ships. One such signaling device was tested on December 31, 1900. Three weeks later, on January 21, 1901, Gray died from a heart attack in Newtonville, Massachusetts.

Some modern authors incorrectly credit Elisha Gray as the namesake of the Gray code, which is actually named after 20th century physicist and electrical researcher Frank Gray.

== Publications ==
Gray wrote several books including:
*&quot;Experimental Researches in Electro-Harmonic Telegraphy and Telephony, 1867–1876&quot; (Appleton, 1878)
*&quot;Telegraphy and Telephony&quot; (1878)
*&quot;Electricity and Magnetism&quot; (1900) and
*&quot;Nature&#x27;s Miracles&quot; (1900) a nontechnical discussion of science and technology for the general public.

<text>The flag of Bahrain () consists of a white band on the left, separated from a red area on the right by five triangles that serve as a serrated line. The five white triangles symbolize the five pillars of Islam, the red on the flag represents the blood of the martyrs and the battles of Bahrain, and the white represents peace. It is sometimes mistaken for the flag of Qatar, but the latter flag is maroon, has nine points and normally has a much greater length-to-width ratio.

White makes up (32.5%) of the flag, while red makes up (67.5%).

== Construction sheet ==
==Use==
The flag is used on land and at sea as a national, civil and war ensign. In 2002, the King of Bahrain Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, issued Decree by Law No.(4) for 2002, which pertained to the flag:

*Article I: The Flag of the Kingdom of Bahrain shall take a rectangular shape, and shall be divided into two main sections; the first in red, and the other in white color.
*Article II: The King shall have his own flag, for which a royal order shall be issued to determine its shape, measures, and places.
*Article III: The Flag of the Kingdom of Bahrain shall be hoisted on the Royal Court, Palaces, governmental buildings, public establishments, embassies, Bahraini bureaus abroad, and Bahraini ships.
*Article IV: Each non-Bahraini ship entering the territorial waters of the Kingdom of Bahrain shall hoist the Flag of the Kingdom, and shall keep the flag hoisted till it departs from the territorial waters of the Kingdom.
*Article V: The Flag shall be hoisted on governmental buildings, public institutions during public holidays and occasions from sun-rise to sun-set.
*Article VI: The Flag of the Kingdom of Bahrain shall not be hoisted on vehicles, except on the official protocol vehicles.
*Article VII: The Flag of the Kingdom of Bahrain shall be hoisted half mast at the state of mourning.
*Article VIII: The Flag of the Kingdom of Bahrain shall not be used for commercial purposes.
*Article IX: In case the Flag is used otherwise, and not as stipulated in the above law, a punishment of one month of imprisonment as a maximum, or a fine not exceeding than BD 100, or both shall be inflicted.

==History==
The earliest known flags of Bahrain were plain red. In 1820, Bahrain signed a general maritime treaty with the British Empire, and as result, a white stripe was added to the flag to signify the treaty and to distinguish it from the flags commonly used by pirates. In 1932, a serrated edge was added to the flag in order to differentiate it from those of its neighbours.

The flag originally had twenty-eight white points, but this was reduced to eight in 1972. On 14 February 2002, the number was again reduced, to five, so that each of the points could stand for one of the Five Pillars of Islam.

<doc id="417844" wikidata="Q131043" url="?curid=417844" title="Troodon">
<text>Troodon ( ; Troödon in older sources) is a former wastebasket taxon and a potentially dubious genus of relatively small, bird-like theropod dinosaurs definitively known from the Campanian age of the Late Cretaceous period (about 77 million years ago). It includes at least one species, Troodon formosus, known from Montana. Discovered in October 1855, &quot;T. formosus&quot; was among the first dinosaurs found in North America, although it was thought to be a lizard until 1877. Several well-known troodontid specimens from the Dinosaur Park Formation in Alberta were once believed to be members of this genus. However, recent analyses in 2017 have found this genus to be undiagnostic and referred some of these specimens to the genus &quot;Stenonychosaurus&quot; (long believed to be synonymous with &quot;Troodon&quot;), some to the genus &quot;Latenivenatrix&quot;, and some to the genus &quot;Pectinodon&quot;. The genus name is Ancient Greek for &quot;wounding tooth&quot;, referring to the teeth, which were different from those of most other theropods known at the time of their discovery. The teeth bear prominent, apically oriented serrations. These &quot;wounding&quot; serrations, however, are morphometrically more similar to those of herbivorous reptiles, and suggest a possibly omnivorous diet.

== History of discovery ==
===Early research===
The name was originally spelled &quot;Troödon&quot; (with a diaeresis) by Joseph Leidy in 1856, which was officially amended to its current status by Sauvage in 1876. The type specimen of &quot;Troodon&quot; has caused problems with classification, as the entire genus is based only on one single tooth from the Judith River Formation. &quot;Troodon&quot; has historically been a highly unstable classification and has been the subject of numerous conflicting synonymies with similar theropod specimens.

The &quot;Troodon&quot; tooth was originally classified as a &quot;lacertilian&quot; (lizard) by Leidy, but reassigned as a megalosaurid dinosaur by Franz Nopcsa von Felső-Szilvás in 1901 (Megalosauridae having historically been a wastebin taxon for most carnivorous dinosaurs). In 1924, Gilmore suggested that the tooth belonged to the herbivorous pachycephalosaur &quot;Stegoceras&quot; and that &quot;Stegoceras&quot; was in fact a junior synonym of &quot;Troodon&quot;. The similarity of troodontid teeth to those of herbivorous dinosaurs continues to lead many paleontologists to believe that these animals were omnivores. The classification of &quot;Troodon&quot; as a pachycephalosaur was followed for many years, during which time the family Pachycephalosauridae was known as Troodontidae. In 1945, Charles Mortram Sternberg rejected the possibility that &quot;Troodon&quot; was a pachycephalosaur thanks to its stronger similarity to the teeth of other carnivorous dinosaurs. With &quot;Troodon&quot; now classified as a theropod, the family Troodontidae could no longer be used for the dome-headed dinosaurs, so Sternberg named a new family for them, &quot;Pachycephalosauridae&quot;.

===Naming of related species===
The first specimens assigned to &quot;Troodon&quot; that were not teeth were both found by Sternberg in the early 1930s in the Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta. The first was named &quot;Stenonychosaurus inequalis&quot; by Sternberg in 1932 based on a foot, fragments of a hand, and some tail vertebrae. A remarkable feature of these remains was the enlarged claw on the second toe, which is now recognized as characteristic of early paravians. Sternberg initially classified &quot;Stenonychosaurus&quot; as a member of the family Coeluridae. The second, a partial lower jaw bone, was described by Gilmore (1932) as a new species of lizard which he named &quot;Polyodontosaurus grandis&quot;. In 1951, Sternberg later recognized &quot;P. grandis&quot; as a possible synonym of &quot;Troodon&quot; and speculated that, since &quot;Stenonychosaurus&quot; had a &quot;very peculiar pes&quot; and &quot;Troodon&quot; &quot;equally unusual teeth&quot;, they may be closely related. Unfortunately, no comparable specimens were available at that time to test the idea. In a recent revision of the material by van der Reest &amp; Currie, &quot;Polyodontosaurus&quot; was determined to be a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;, not fit for synonymy with other taxa.

A more complete skeleton of &quot;Stenonychosaurus&quot; was described by Dale Russell in 1969 from the Dinosaur Park Formation, which eventually formed the scientific foundation for a famous life-sized sculpture of &quot;Stenonychosaurus&quot; accompanied by its fictional, humanoid descendant, the &quot;dinosauroid&quot;. &quot;Stenonychosaurus&quot; became a well-known theropod in the 1980s, when the feet and braincase were described in more detail. Along with &quot;Saurornithoides&quot;, it formed the family Saurornithoididae. Based on differences in tooth structure and the extremely fragmentary nature of the original &quot;Troodon formosus&quot; specimens, saurornithoidids were thought to be close relatives, while &quot;Troodon&quot; was considered a dubious possible relative of the family. Phil Currie, reviewing the pertinent specimens in 1987, showed that supposed differences in tooth and jaw structure among troodontids and saurornithoidids were based on age and position of the tooth in the jaw, rather than a difference in species. He reclassified &quot;Stenonychosaurus inequalis&quot;, &quot;Polyodontosaurus grandis&quot;, and &quot;Pectinodon bakkeri&quot; as junior synonyms of &quot;Troodon formosus&quot;. Currie also made Saurornithoididae a junior synonym of Troodontidae. In 1988, Gregory S. Paul went farther and included &quot;Saurornithoides mongoliensis&quot; in the genus &quot;Troodon&quot; as &quot;T. mongoliensis&quot;, but this reclassification, along with many other unilateral synonymizations of well known genera, was not adopted by other researchers. Currie&#x27;s classification of all North American troodontid material in the single species &quot;Troodon formosus&quot; became widely adopted by other paleontologists and all of the specimens once called &quot;Stenonychosaurus&quot; were referred to as &quot;Troodon&quot; in scientific literature through the early 21st century.

===Dissolution of the one species model===
However, the concept that all Late Cretaceous North American troodontids belong to one single species began to be questioned soon after Currie&#x27;s 1987 paper was published, including by Currie himself. Currie and colleagues (1990) noted that, while they believed the Judith River troodontids were all &quot;T. formosus&quot;, troodontid fossils from other formations, such as the Hell Creek Formation and Lance Formation, might belong to different species. In 1991, George Olshevsky assigned the Lance formation fossils, which had first been named &quot;Pectinodon bakkeri&quot;, but later synonymized with &quot;Troodon formosus&quot;, to the species &quot;Troodon bakkeri&quot;, and several other researchers (including Currie) have reverted to keeping the Dinosaur Park Formation fossils separate as &quot;Troodon inequalis&quot; (now &quot;Stenonychosaurus inequalis&quot;).

In 2011, Zanno and colleagues reviewed the convoluted history of troodontid classification in Late Cretaceous North America. They followed Longrich (2008) in treating &quot;Pectinodon bakkeri&quot; as a valid genus and noted that it is likely the numerous Late Cretaceous specimens currently assigned to &quot;Troodon formosus&quot;, but that a more thorough review of the specimens is required. Because the holotype of &quot;T. formosus&quot; is a single tooth, this renders &quot;Troodon&quot; a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;.

In 2017, Evans and colleagues further discussed the undiagnostic nature of the holotype of &quot;Troodon formosus&quot; and suggested that &quot;Stenonychosaurus&quot; be used for troodontid skeletal material from the Dinosaur Park Formation. Later in the same year, Aaron J. van der Reest and Currie came to a similar conclusion as Evans and colleagues and also split much of the material assigned to &quot;Stenonychosaurus&quot; into a new genus: &quot;Latenivenatrix&quot;. In 2018, Varricchio and colleagues disagreed with Evans and colleagues, citing that &quot;Stenonychosaurus&quot; had not been used in the thirty years since Currie and colleagues synonymized it with &quot;Troodon&quot; and they indicated that &quot;&quot;Troodon formosus&quot; remains the proper name for this taxon&quot;. This conclusion by Varricchio was agreed upon by Sellés and colleagues in their 2021 description of &quot;Tamarro&quot;. Varricchio&#x27;s comments were later addressed by Cullen and colleagues in their 2021 review of Dinosaur Park Formation biodiversity, where they noted that, while &quot;Stenonychosaurus&quot; has indeed not been used for 30 years, Currie&#x27;s original hypothesis of subjective synonymy (based on tooth and jaw morphology) was never directly tested and, given that later research found that teeth were not diagnostic below the family level in troodontids, Currie&#x27;s original hypothesis is therefore not supported by the available data, regardless of the amount of time since it was originally proposed. They suggested that the description of more complete skeletal material (i.e. containing dental, frontal, and postcranial elements) that can be tied to the holotype could allow the direct testing of the synonymy hypothesis, but re-affirmed that, for now, given the lack of supporting evidence, the synonymy of &quot;Troodon&quot; and &quot;Stenonychosaurus&quot; cannot be maintained and that merely remaining untested for 30 years is insufficient justification to accept a proposed lumping of taxa lacking overlapping diagnostic materials. However, Varricchio and others still insist on their naming method.

==Classification==
&quot;Troodon&quot; is considered to be one of the most derived members of its family. Along with &quot;Zanabazar&quot;, &quot;Saurornithoides&quot;, and &quot;Talos&quot;, it forms a clade of specialized troodontids.

Below is a cladogram of Troodontidae by Zanno &quot;et al.&quot; in 2011.

==Paleobiology==

One study was based on multiple &quot;Troodon&quot; teeth that have been collected from Late Cretaceous deposits in northern Alaska. These teeth are much larger than those collected from more southern sites, providing evidence that northern Alaskan populations of &quot;Troodon&quot; grew to larger average body size, hinting at Bergmann&#x27;s rule. This study also provides an analysis of the proportions and wear patterns of a large sample of &quot;Troodon&quot; teeth. It proposes that the wear patterns of all &quot;Troodon&quot; teeth suggest a diet of soft foods - inconsistent with bone chewing, invertebrate exoskeletons, or tough plant items. This study hypothesizes a diet primarily consisting of meat. A pellet possibly belonging to &quot;Troodon&quot; suggests it hunted early mammals such as &quot;Alphadon&quot;. 

In 2011, another derived troodontid, &quot;Linhevenator&quot;, was described from Inner Mongolia. It was noted by the authors as having relatively short and robust forelimbs, along with an enlarged second pedal ungual akin to that of the dromaeosaurids compared to more basal troodontids. It was proposed that derived troodontids had convergently evolved dromaeosaurid-style large second pedal unguals, likely as an adaptation relating to predation. The authors noted that it is plausible that this may be applicable to other derived troodontids, including &quot;Troodon&quot;, although this is currently uncertain due to a paucity of sufficient remains of the latter genus.

=== Communal nesting ===
A 2023 study using presumed &quot;Troodon&quot; eggshells from the Oldman Formation used clumped isotope thermometry to determine their formation and development. The study found that in contrast to the accelerated mineralization of eggs in modern birds, &quot;Troodon&quot; and likely other non-avian maniraptorans had slowed egg calcification akin to other reptiles. This would indicate that, unlike birds, &quot;Troodon&quot; and other maniraptorans had two functional ovaries that would limit the number of eggs produced. Thus, the study concluded that the large clutches of fossilized eggs present in the formation, despite the limited egg production each individual had, would indicate that &quot;Troodon&quot; had communal nesting behavior, where eggs would be laid together at a single nest by multiple females, forming large clutches. This is a strategy also used by some modern birds, such as ostriches.

==Paleoecology==
The type specimen of &quot;Troodon formosus&quot; was found in the Judith River Formation of Montana. The rocks of the Judith River Formation are equivalent in age with the Oldman Formation of Alberta, which has been dated to between 77.5 and 76.5 million years ago.

In the past, remains have been attributed to the same genus as the Judith River &quot;Troodon&quot; from a wide variety of other geological formations. It is now recognized as unlikely that all of these fossils, which come from localities hundreds or thousands of miles apart, separated by millions of years of time, represent a single species or even a single genus of troodontid. Further study and more fossils are needed to determine how many species of &quot;Troodon&quot; existed. It is questionable that, after further study, any additional species can be referred to &quot;Troodon&quot;, in which case the genus would be considered a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;.

Remains referred to &quot;Troodon&quot; are known from the Prince Creek Formation, a rock layer in Alaska that dates from the latest Campanian to Maastrichtian ages of the Late Cretaceous. Based on the presence of gypsum and pyrite in the rocks, it suggests that the formation was bordered by a large body of water. It seems that, based on the presence of pollen fossils, the dominant plants were trees, shrubs, herbs, and flowering plants. The temperature ranged from possibly 2-12°C, which roughly correlates to 36-54°F, and based on Alaska&#x27;s position in the late Cretaceous, the area faced 120 or so days of winter darkness. This maniraptoran lived alongside many other reptiles, like the centrosaurine &quot;Pachyrhinosaurus perotorum&quot;, a species of the saurolophine hadrosaurid &quot;Edmontosaurus&quot;, the pachycephalosaurin &quot;Alaskacephale gangloffi&quot;, an unnamed azhdarchid pterosaur, and the tyrannosaurine &quot;Nanuqsaurus hoglundi&quot;. It also lived alongside the metatherian mammal &quot;Unnuakomys hutchisoni.&quot; Based on the amount of teeth found, this troodontid was the most common theropod of the formation, making up 2/3 of all specimens, which is a stark contrast to more southern deposits in Montana, where troodontids only comprise 6% of all theropod remains. This, along with evidence that &quot;Troodon&quot; was more abundant during cooler intervals, such as the early Maastrichtian, may indicate that &quot;Troodon&quot; favored cooler climates.

Additional specimens currently referred to &quot;Troodon&quot; come from the upper Two Medicine Formation of Montana. &quot;Troodon&quot;-like teeth have been found in the lower Javelina Formation of Texas and the Naashoibito Member of the Ojo Alamo Formation in New Mexico.

<doc id="417845" wikidata="Q5345498" url="?curid=417845" title="Edward Sugden, 1st Baron St Leonards">
<text>Edward Burtenshaw Sugden, 1st Baron Saint Leonards, (12 February 178129 January 1875) was a British lawyer, judge and Conservative politician.

==Background==
Sugden was the son of a high-class hairdresser and wig-maker in Westminster, London. Details of his education are said to be &quot;obscure&quot;. It appears that he was mostly self-taught, although he also attended a private school.

His humble origins and rapid rise were frequently remarked upon by his contemporaries: when he first attempted to enter Parliament, he was heckled at hustings for being the son of a barber. Later, Thomas Fowell Buxton would write that &quot;there are few instances in modern times of a rise equal to that of Sir Edward Sugden&quot;.

==Legal and political career==
After practising for some years as a conveyancer, Sugden was called to the bar at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1807, having already published his well-known &quot;Concise and Practical Treatise on the Law of Vendors and Purchasers of Estates&quot;. In 1822 he was made King&#x27;s Counsel. He was returned at different times for various boroughs to the House of Commons, where he made himself prominent by his opposition to the Reform Bill of 1832. He was appointed Solicitor General in 1829, receiving the customary knighthood. As Solicitor-General he took a narrow view of Jewish emancipation, arguing that &quot;They had possessed nothing; they held nothing. They had no civil rights; they never had any.&quot;

In 1834–5 Sugden was made Lord Chancellor of Ireland in Peel&#x27;s first ministry, and was sworn of the Privy Council on 15 December 1834. Sugden was again the Irish Lord Chancellor in Peel&#x27;s second ministry, serving from 1841 to 1846. In 1849, Sugden published &quot;A Treatise on the Law of Property as administered in the House of Lords&quot;, in which he criticised the decisions given in the House of Lords when acting as a Court of Appeal. In Lord Derby&#x27;s first government in 1852 he became Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain and was raised to the peerage as Baron Saint Leonards, of Slaugham in the County of Sussex. In this position he devoted himself with energy and vigour to the reform of the law (note his important dissenting opinion in &quot;Jorden v Money (1854) 5 HL Cas 185&quot;); Lord Derby on his return to power in 1858 again offered him the same office, which from considerations of health he declined. He continued, however, to take an active interest especially in the legal matters that came before the House of Lords, and bestowed his particular attention on the reform of the law of property. He championed the fulfilment of the will of J. M. W. Turner with regard to his art bequests in 1857–70.

==Publications==

Lord Saint Leonards was the author of various important legal publications, many of which have passed through several editions. Besides the treatise on purchasers already mentioned, they include Powers, Cases decided by the House of Lords, Gilbert on Uses, New Real Property Laws and Handybook of Property Law, Misrepresentations in Campbells Lives of Lyndhurst and Brougham, corrected by St Leonards.

==Family==
Lord Saint Leonards married Winifred, daughter of John Knapp, in 1808. The marriage was an elopement, which resulted in Lady Saint Leonards’s never being invited to the puritanical Victorian court over the course of their five decade marriage. She died in May 1861. Lord Saint Leonards died at Boyle Farm, Thames Ditton, in January 1875, aged 93, and was succeeded in the barony by his grandson, Edward. Sugden Road in nearby Long Ditton is named after him.

=== Inheritance dispute ===
After his death his will was missing but his daughter, Charlotte Sugden, was able to recollect the contents of a most intricate document, and in the action of Sugden v. Lord Saint Leonards (L.R. 1 P.D. 154) the Court of Chancery accepted her evidence and granted probate, admitting into the probate a paper propounded as containing the provisions of the lost will. This decision established the proposition that the contents of a lost will, that can be proven to have existed, may be proved by secondary evidence, even of a single witness. Charlotte Sugden submitted sworn testimony that Lord Saint Leonards was in the habit of reading his will every night, such that his daughter had to listen to it and over some years memorised it. This decision became a well known fact and narrow precedent in legal circles, departing from provisions of the Wills Act 1837 which remained the principal legislation governing an area shaped by equity and later by common law.

<text>Chemical energy is the energy of chemical substances that is released when the substances undergo a chemical reaction and transform into other substances. Some examples of storage media of chemical energy include batteries, food, and gasoline (as well as oxygen gas, which is of high chemical energy due to its relatively weak double bond and indispensable for chemical-energy release in gasoline combustion). Breaking and re-making chemical bonds involves energy, which may be either absorbed by or evolved from a chemical system. If reactants with relatively weak electron-pair bonds convert to more strongly bonded products, energy is released. Therefore, relatively weakly bonded and unstable molecules store chemical energy.

Energy that can be released or absorbed because of a reaction between chemical substances is equal to the difference between the energy content of the products and the reactants, if the initial and final temperature is the same. This change in energy can be estimated from the bond energies of the reactants and products. It can also be calculated from formula_1, the internal energy of formation of the reactant molecules, and formula_2, the internal energy of formation of the product molecules. The internal energy change of a chemical process is equal to the heat exchanged if it is measured under conditions of constant volume and equal initial and final temperature, as in a closed container such as a bomb calorimeter. However, under conditions of constant pressure, as in reactions in vessels open to the atmosphere, the measured heat change is not always equal to the internal energy change, because pressure-volume work also releases or absorbs energy. (The heat change at constant pressure is equal to the enthalpy change, in this case the enthalpy of reaction, if initial and final temperatures are equal).

A related term is the heat of combustion, which is the energy mostly of the weak double bonds of molecular oxygen released due to a combustion reaction and often applied in the study of fuels. Food is similar to hydrocarbon and carbohydrate fuels, and when it is oxidized to carbon dioxide and water, the energy released is analogous to the heat of combustion (though assessed differently than for a hydrocarbon fuel—see food energy).

Chemical potential energy is a form of potential energy related to the structural arrangement of atoms or molecules. This arrangement may be the result of chemical bonds within a molecule or interactions between them. Chemical energy of a chemical substance can be transformed to other forms of energy by a chemical reaction. For example, when a fuel is burned, the chemical energy of molecular oxygen and the fuel is converted to heat. Green plants transform solar energy to chemical energy (mostly of oxygen) through the process of photosynthesis, and electrical energy can be converted to chemical energy and vice versa through electrochemical reactions.

The similar term chemical potential is used to indicate the potential of a substance to undergo a change of configuration, be it in the form of a chemical reaction, spatial transport, particle exchange with a reservoir, etc. It is &quot;not&quot; a form of potential energy itself, but is more closely related to free energy. The confusion in terminology arises from the fact that in other areas of physics not dominated by entropy, all potential energy is available to do useful work and drives the system to spontaneously undergo changes of configuration, and thus there is no distinction between &quot;free&quot; and &quot;non-free&quot; potential energy (hence the one word &quot;potential&quot;). However, in systems of large entropy such as chemical systems, the total amount of energy present (and conserved according to the first law of thermodynamics) of which this chemical potential energy is a part, is separated from the amount of that energy—thermodynamic free energy (from which chemical potential is derived)—which (appears to) drive the system forward spontaneously as the global entropy increases (in accordance with the &quot;second&quot; law).

<doc id="417848" wikidata="Q127179" url="?curid=417848" title="Flag of Bangladesh">
<text>The national flag of Bangladesh was adopted officially on 17 January 1972. It consists of a red circle on top of a dark green banner. The red circle is offset slightly toward the hoist so that it appears centred when the flag is flying. While there are numerous interpretations, the green of the flag symbolises the lush landscape of Bangladesh, and the red circle, reminiscent of the rising sun, represents the sacrifice made by the people during the Liberation War of 1971.

The flag is based on a similar flag used during the Bangladesh War of Independence of 1971, which had a yellow map of the country inside the red disc. In 1972, this map was removed from the flag. One reason given was the difficulty for rendering the map correctly on both sides of the flag. The civil ensign and naval ensign place it in the canton of a red or white field, respectively.

==Origin==
The first version of the flag was designed and made by a section of student leaders and activists of Swadheen Bangla Nucleus on 6 June 1970, at room 108 of Iqbal Hall (now Sergeant Zahurul Haq hall), Dhaka University; students involved with the design were namely Kazi Aref Ahmed, ASM Abdur Rab, Shahjahan Siraj, Manirul Islam (Marshal Moni), Swapan Kumar Choudhury, Quamrul Alam Khan Khasru, Hasanul Haq Inu, and Yousuf Salahuddin Ahmed. The flag was made from clothes donated by Bazlur Rahman Lasker, the owner of Apollo Tailors, Dhaka New Market.

A map of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) was first traced on a tracing paper from an atlas by Hasanul Haq Inu, Yousuf Salahuddin Ahmed and Enamul Haq, at Enamul&#x27;s room (312) in Quaid-I Azam Hall (now Titumir Hall), EPUET (now BUET). Later, the map was painted in the red circle by Shib Narayan Das. On 2 March 1971, this initial version of the flag was hoisted in Bangladesh for the first time at Dhaka University, by student leader A. S. M. Abdur Rab, the then Vice President of Dhaka University Central Students&#x27; Union (DUCSU). The flag was conceived so as to exclude the star and crescent considered as symbols of West Pakistan (now Pakistan).

On April 1971, the flag was hoisted for the first time in foreign mission, when Deputy High Commissioner Hosen Ali along with other officials declared their alliance with the newly formed Mujibnagar Government.

On 25 July 1971, Zakaria Pintoo, captain of the Shadhin Bangla Football Team became the first person to hoist the Bangladesh flag on foreign soil, before a match in Nadia district of the Indian state of West Bengal.

On 13 January 1972, the flag was modified. The map from the centre was removed, and the red disk moved towards the hoist so as to be visually centred when the flag is in flight on a mast.

==Symbolism==
According to &quot;CIA World Fact Book&quot; and official descriptions, the green used in the flag represents the lushness of the green landscape of the country and the red disk of the flag represents the blood the Bengalis shed during the Bangladesh Liberation War and the blood of those who died for the independence of Bangladesh. An alternative description says that the green background represents the youth power and progress, while the red disk represents the revolution and renaissance. The circularity of the red design indicates the rising sun, similar to the Japanese flag.

==Design==

According to Bangladeshi government specifications, following is the specification of the national flag:
:*The flag will be in bottle green and rectangular in size in the proportion of length to width of 10:6, with a red circle in near middle.
:*The red circle will have a radius of one-fifth of the length of the flag. Its centre will be placed on the intersecting point of the perpendicular drawn from the nine-twentieth part of the length of the flag, and the horizontal line drawn through the middle of its width.
:*The green base of the flag will be of Procion Brilliant Green H-2RS 50 parts per 1000. The red circular part will be of Procion Brilliant Orange H-2RS 60 parts per 1000.
:*Depending on the size of the building the flag sizes will be ; ; . The size of the flag for cars is , and the size of the table flag for bilateral conferences is .

== Protocol ==

On 16 December 2013, the 42nd Victory Day of Bangladesh, 27,117 people gathered at the National Parade Ground in Dhaka&#x27;s Sher-e-Bangla Nagar and created a &quot;human flag&quot; which was recorded in &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; as the world&#x27;s largest human national flag. This feat was short, however, as India topped the record on 7 December 2014 with 43,830 people participating to achieve the new world record for largest human national flag.

In July 2021, Saimon Imran Hayder used 16,000 envelopes to create a 240m2 Bangladesh flag at the InterContinental Dhaka which was also a Guinness World Records attempt.

<text>An action game is a video game genre that emphasizes physical challenges, including hand–eye coordination and reaction time. The genre includes a large variety of sub-genres, such as fighting games, beat &#x27;em ups, shooter games, rhythm games and platform games. Multiplayer online battle arena and some real-time strategy games are also considered action games.

In an action game, the player typically controls a character often in the form of a protagonist or avatar. This player character must navigate a level, collecting objects, avoiding obstacles, and battling enemies with their natural skills as well as weapons and other tools at their disposal. At the end of a level or group of levels, the player must often defeat a boss enemy that is more challenging and often a major antagonist in the game&#x27;s story. Enemy attacks and obstacles deplete the player character&#x27;s health and lives, and the player receives a game over when they run out of lives.

Alternatively, the player gets to the end of the game by finishing a sequence of levels to complete a final goal, and see the credits. Some action games, such as early arcade games, are unbeatable and have an indefinite number of levels. The player&#x27;s only goal is to get as far as they can, to maximize their score.

== Defining elements ==
The action genre includes any game where the player overcomes challenges by physical means such as precise aim and quick response times. Action games can sometimes incorporate other challenges such as races, puzzles, or collecting objects, but they are not central to the genre. Players may encounter tactical and exploration challenges, but these games first-and-foremost require high reaction speed and good hand–eye coordination. The player is often under time pressure, and there is not enough time for complex strategic planning. In general, faster action games are more challenging. Action games may sometimes involve puzzle solving, but they are usually quite simple because the player is under immense time pressure.

== Game design ==

=== Levels ===

Players advance through an action game by completing a series of levels. Levels are often grouped by theme, with similar graphics and enemies called a world. Each level involves a variety of challenges, whether dancing in a dance game or shooting things in a shooter, which the player must overcome to win the game. Older games force players to restart a level after dying, although action games evolved to offer saved games and checkpoints to allow the player to restart partway through a level. The obstacles and enemies in a level do not usually vary between play sessions, allowing players to learn by trial and error. However, levels sometimes add an element of randomness, such as an enemy that randomly appears or that takes an unpredictable path.

Levels in an action game may be linear or nonlinear, and sometimes include shortcuts. For levels that require exploration, the player may need to search for a level exit that is hidden or guarded by enemies. Such levels can also contain secrets—hidden or hard-to-reach objects or places that contain something valuable. The prize can be a bonus (see below) or a non-standard exit that allows a player to access a hidden level, or jump ahead several levels. Action games sometimes offer a teleporter that will cause the player&#x27;s avatar to re-appear elsewhere in the same level. Levels often make use of locked doors that can only be opened with a specific key found elsewhere in the level.

Action games sometimes make use of time restrictions to increase the challenge. However, game levels typically do not react to time passing, and day/night cycles are rare. When the timer expires, the player typically loses a life, although some games generate a difficult enemy or challenge. If the level is completed with time remaining, this usually adds to the player&#x27;s score.

=== Character abilities ===
In most action games, the player controls a single avatar as the protagonist. The avatar has the ability to navigate and maneuver, and often collects or manipulates objects. They have a range of defenses and attacks, such as shooting or punching. Many action games make use of a powerful attack that destroys all enemies within a limited range, but this attack is rare.

Players may find a power-up within the game world that grants temporary or permanent improvements to their abilities. For example, the avatar may gain an increase in speed, more powerful attacks, or a temporary shield from attacks. Some action games even allow players to spend upgrade points on the power ups of their choice.

=== Obstacles and enemies ===
In action games that involve navigating a space, players will encounter obstacles, traps, and enemies. Enemies typically follow fixed patterns and attack the player, although newer action games may make use of more complex artificial intelligence to pursue the player. Enemies sometimes appear in groups or waves, with enemies increasing in strength and number until the end of the level. Enemies may also appear out of thin air. This can involve an invisible spawn point, or a visible generator which can be destroyed by the player. These points may generate enemies indefinitely, or only up to a certain number.

At the end of a level or group of themed levels, players often encounter a boss. This boss enemy will often resemble a larger or more difficult version of a regular enemy. A boss may require a special weapon or attack method, such as striking when the boss opens their mouth, or attacking particular part of the boss.

=== Health and lives ===
In many action games, the avatar has a certain number of hit-markers or health, which are depleted by enemy attacks and other hazards. Sometimes health can be replenished by collecting an in-game object. When the player runs out of health, the player dies. The player&#x27;s avatar is often given a small number of chances to retry after death, typically referred to as lives. Upon beginning a new life, the player resumes the game either from the same location they died, a checkpoint, or the start of the level. Upon starting a new life, the avatar is typically invincible for a few seconds to allow the player to re-orient themselves. Players may earn extra lives by reaching a certain score or by finding an in-game object. Arcade games still limit the number of player lives, while home video games have shifted increasingly to unlimited lives.

=== Graphics and interface ===
Action games take place in either 2D or 3D from a variety of perspectives. 2D action games typically use a side view or top-down view. The screen frequently scrolls as the player explores the level, although many games scroll through the level automatically to push the player forward. In 3D action games, the perspective is usually tied to the avatar from a first-person perspective or third-person perspective. However, some 3D games offer a context-sensitive perspective that is controlled by an artificial intelligence camera. Most of what the player needs to know is contained within a single screen, although action games frequently make use of a heads-up display that display important information such as health or ammunition. Action games sometimes make use of maps which can be accessed during lulls in action, or a mini-map that is always visible.

=== Scoring and victory ===
Action games tend to set simple goals, and reaching them is obvious. A common goal is to defeat the end-of-game boss. This is often presented in the form of a structured story, with a happy ending upon winning the game. In some games, the goal changes as the player reveals more of the story.

Many action games keep track of the player&#x27;s score. Points are awarded for completing certain challenges, or defeating certain enemies. Skillful play is often rewarded with point multipliers, such as in &quot;Pac-Man&quot; where each ghost that the avatar eats will generate twice as many points as the last. Sometimes action games will offer bonus objects that increase the player&#x27;s score. There is no penalty for failing to collect them, although these bonus objects may unlock hidden levels or special events.

In many action games, achieving a high score is the only goal, and levels increase in difficulty until the player loses. Arcade games are more likely to be unbeatable, as they make their money by forcing the player to lose the game. Games sold at home are more likely to have discrete victory conditions, since a publisher wants the player to purchase another game when they are done.

== Subgenres ==
Action games contain several major subgenres. However, there are a number of action games that do not fit any particular subgenres, as well as other types of genres like adventure or strategy games that have action elements.

Character action games, also called &quot;character-driven&quot; games, &quot;character games&quot; or just &quot;action games&quot;, are a broad category of action games, referring to a variety of games that are driven by the physical actions of player characters. The term dates back to the golden age of arcade video games in the early 1980s, when the terms &quot;action games&quot; and &quot;character games&quot; began being used to distinguish a new emerging genre of character-driven action games from the space shoot &#x27;em ups that had previously dominated the arcades in the late 1970s. Classic examples of character action games from the early 1980s include &quot;Frogger&quot;, maze games like &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, and platformers like &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;.

* Beat &#x27;em ups, also called &quot;brawlers&quot;, are games that involve fighting through a side-scrolling stage of multiple adversaries, using martial arts or other close-range fighting techniques.
* Fighting games feature combat between pairs of fighters, usually using martial arts moves. Actions are limited to various attacks and defenses, and matches end when a fighter&#x27;s health is reduced to zero. They often make use of special moves and combos. There are both 2D and 3D fighting games, but most 3D fighting games largely take place in a 2D plane and occasionally include side-stepping. They are distinct from sports games such as boxing and wrestling games which attempt to model movements and techniques more realistically.
* Hack and slash games, also called &quot;slash &#x27;em up&quot; or &quot;character action games&quot;, are a subgenre of beat &#x27;em up brawlers that emphasize combat with melee-based weapons, such as swords or blades. They may also feature projectile-based weapons as well (such as guns) as secondary weapons. Popular 2D examples include &quot;Shinobi&quot;, &quot;Golden Axe&quot;, classic &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; (&quot;Shadow Warriors&quot;), &quot;Strider&quot;, and &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Crown&quot;. Popular 3D examples include &quot;Devil May Cry&quot;, &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot;, modern &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot;, &quot;God of War&quot;, and &quot;Bayonetta&quot;.
* Maze games such as &quot;Pac-Man&quot; involve navigating a maze to avoid or chase adversaries.
* Platform games involve jumping between platforms of different heights, while battling enemies and avoiding obstacles. Physics are often unrealistic, and game levels are often vertically exaggerated. They exist in both 2D and 3D forms such as &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; and &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;.
* Side-scrolling character action games, also called &quot;side-scrolling action games&quot; or &quot;side-scrollers&quot;, are a broad category of character action games that were popular from the mid-1980s to the 1990s, which involve player characters defeating large groups of weaker enemies along a side-scrolling playfield. Popular examples included beat &#x27;em ups like &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; and &quot;Double Dragon&quot;, ninja action games like &quot;The Legend of Kage&quot; and &quot;Shinobi&quot;, scrolling platformers like &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; and &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, and run and gun video games like &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot; and &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot;.

Shooter games allow the player to take action at a distance using a ranged weapon, challenging them to aim with accuracy and speed. This subgenre includes first-person shooters, third-person shooters, light gun shooters, rail shooters, run and gun games and a plethora of shoot &#x27;em up games taking place from a top-down or side-scrolling perspective. Space shooters were initially categorized as a separate genre from action games in the early 1980s, when the term was used to refer to character action games, up until character-driven shooters, particularly scrolling run-and-gun shooters, became popular by the late 1980s.

The setting of shooter games often involves military conflicts, whether historical, such as World War II, contemporary, such as Middle East conflicts, or fictional, such as space warfare. Shooter games do not always involve military conflicts. Other settings include hunting games, or follow the story of a criminal, as seen in the popular &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; franchise. Although shooting is almost always a form of violence, non-violent shooters exist as well, such as &quot;Splatoon&quot; which focuses on claiming more territory than the opposing team, by covering the playable environment with colored paint or ink.

Hybrid action games are games that combine elements of action games with elements from other genres.

* Action-adventure games mix elements of both action and adventure game genres such as &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;. Action-adventure games are the most popular subgenre.
* Action role-playing games include features of role-playing games, such as characters with experience points and statistics.
* Battle royale games are a subgenre of action games that combine last-man-standing gameplay with survival game elements. It also frequently includes shooter elements. It is almost exclusively multiplayer in nature, and eschews the complex crafting and resource gathering mechanics of survival games for a faster-paced confrontation game more typical of shooters. The genre is named after the Japanese film &quot;Battle Royale&quot; (2000).
* Multiplayer online battle arena games (also called MOBA, &quot;hero brawler&quot; or &quot;action real-time strategy&quot; games) are a subgenre of real-time strategy (RTS) games with action game elements similar to brawlers or fighting games.
* Rhythm action games challenge the player&#x27;s sense of rhythm, and award points for accurately pressing certain buttons in sync with a musical beat. This is a relatively new subgenre of action game. Rhythm games are sometimes classified as a type of music game.
* Survival games start the player off with minimal resources, in a hostile, open-world environment, and require them to collect resources, craft tools, weapons, and shelter, in order to survive as long as possible. Many are set in procedurally-generated environments, and are open-ended with no set goals. Survival games often feature a crafting system, which allows players to engage in tool-making to convert raw resources into useful items such as medical supplies for healing, structures which shelter the player from a frequently hostile environment, weapons to defend themselves with, and tools to create more complex items, structures, weapons and tools. The survival game genre may overlap with the survival horror genre, in which the player must survive within a setting traditionally associated with the horror genre, such as a zombie apocalypse. The genre also has similarities to action-adventure games.

== Physical impact ==
Studies have shown that people can improve their eyesight by playing action video games. Tests by scientists at the University of Rochester on college students showed that over a period of a month, performance in eye examinations improved by about 20% in those playing &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; compared to those playing &quot;Tetris&quot;. Most arcade games are action games, because they can be difficult for unskilled players, and thus make more money quickly.

Researchers from &quot;Helsinki School of Economics&quot; have shown that people playing a &quot;first-person shooter&quot; might secretly enjoy that their character gets killed in the game, although their expressions might show the contrary. The game used in the study was &quot;James Bond 007: Nightfire&quot;.

== History ==
=== 1970s ===
Shooter games have been around since the beginning of the video game industry. Notable examples of shooting arcade video games during the early-to-mid-1970s include Syzygy Engineering&#x27;s &quot;Computer Space&quot; (1971), &quot;Galaxy Game&quot; (1971), &quot;Tank&quot; (1974) by Kee Games, &quot;Gun Fight&quot; (1975) by Taito and Midway Manufacturing, and Midway&#x27;s &quot;Sea Wolf&quot; (1976). In turn, early arcade shooter video games were inspired by early mainframe games such as &quot;Spacewar!&quot; (1962) as well as arcade electro-mechanical games such as &quot;Periscope&quot; (1965) and gun games.

A major turning point for action video games came with the 1978 release of Taito&#x27;s shoot &#x27;em up game &quot;Space Invaders&quot;, which marked the beginning of the golden age of arcade video games. The game was designed by Tomohiro Nishikado, who drew inspiration from Atari&#x27;s &quot;Breakout&quot; (1976) and the science fiction genre. Nishikado added several interactive elements to &quot;Space Invaders&quot; that he found lacking in earlier video games, such as the ability for enemies to react to the player&#x27;s movement and fire back and a game over triggered by enemies killing the player, either by getting hit or enemies reaching the bottom of the screen, rather than a timer running out.

In contrast to earlier arcade games which often had a timer, &quot;Space Invaders&quot; introduced the &quot;concept of going round after round.&quot; It also gave the player multiple lives before the game ends, and saved the high score. It also had a basic story with animated characters along with a &quot;crescendo of action and climax&quot; which laid the groundwork for later video games, according to Eugene Jarvis, who said many games &quot;still rely on the multiple life, progressively difficult level paradigm&quot; of &quot;Space Invaders&quot;.

Following the mainstream success of &quot;Space Invaders&quot;, the industry came to be dominated by action games, which have remained a dominant genre in video arcades and on game consoles through to the present day. &quot;Space Invaders&quot; set the template for later games in the shooter subgenre, and it is considered one of the most influential games of all time.

During the arcade golden age, from the late 1970s to early 1980s, a wide variety of new subgenres were created. The success of &quot;Space Invaders&quot; led to space shooters becoming the dominant genre in arcades for a few years, before a new genre of character-driven action games emerged in the early 1980s.

=== 1980s ===
The term &quot;action games&quot; began being used in the early 1980s, in reference to a new genre of character action games that emerged from Japanese arcade developers, drawing inspiration from manga and anime culture. According to Eugene Jarvis, these new character-driven Japanese action games emphasized &quot;character development, hand-drawn animation and backgrounds, and a more deterministic, scripted, pattern-type&quot; of play. Terms such as &quot;action games&quot; or &quot;character games&quot; began being used to distinguish these new character-driven action games from the space shooters that had previously dominated the video game industry. The emphasis on character-driven gameplay in turn enabled a wider variety of subgenres.

Namco&#x27;s hit maze game &quot;Pac-Man&quot; (1980) popularized the genre of &quot;character-led&quot; action games. It was one of the first popular non-shooting action games, defining key elements of the genre such as &quot;parallel visual processing&quot; which requires simultaneously keeping track of multiple entities, including the player character, the character&#x27;s location, the enemies, and the energizers. Other classic examples of character action games that followed include Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; (1981), which established the template for the platform game subgenre, as well as Konami&#x27;s &quot;Frogger&quot; (1981) and Universal Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;Lady Bug&quot; (1981). Martial arts action games eventually emerged in the mid-1980s, with Data East&#x27;s &quot;Karate Champ&quot; (1984) establishing the one-on-one fighting game subgenre.

While Japanese developers were creating a character-driven action game genre in the early 1980s, American developers largely adopted a different approach to game design at the time. According to Eugene Jarvis, American arcade developers focused mainly on space shooters during the late 1970s to early 1980s, greatly influenced by Japanese space shooters but taking the genre in a different direction from the &quot;more deterministic, scripted, pattern-type&quot; gameplay of Japanese games, towards a more &quot;programmer-centric design culture, emphasizing algorithmic generation of backgrounds and enemy dispatch&quot; and &quot;an emphasis on random-event generation, particle-effect explosions and physics&quot; as seen in arcade games such as his own &quot;Defender&quot; (1981) and &quot;&quot; (1982) as well as Atari&#x27;s &quot;Asteroids&quot; (1979).

In the mid-1980s, side-scrolling character action games emerged, combining elements from earlier side-view, single-screen character action games, such as single-screen platformers, with the side-scrolling of space shooters. These new side-scrolling character-driven action games featured large character sprites in colorful, side-scrolling environments, with the core gameplay consisting of fighting large groups of weaker enemies using attacks/weapons such as punches, kicks, guns, swords, ninjutsu or magic.

The most notable early example was Irem&#x27;s &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; (1984), the first beat &#x27;em up and the most influential side-scrolling martial arts action game. It was based upon two Hong Kong martial arts films, Bruce Lee&#x27;s &quot;Game of Death&quot; (1973) and Jackie Chan&#x27;s &quot;Wheels on Meals&quot; (1984), This side-scrolling arcade action format became popular during the mid-to-late 1980s, with examples including ninja action games such as Taito&#x27;s &quot;The Legend of Kage&quot; (1985) and Sega&#x27;s &quot;Shinobi&quot; (1987), run and gun video games such as Namco&#x27;s &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot; (1986), and beat &#x27;em ups such as Technōs Japan&#x27;s &quot;Renegade&quot; (1986) and &quot;Double Dragon&quot; (1987).

Shigeru Miyamoto combined the platforming of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; and &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; (1983) with side-scrolling elements from racing game &quot;Excitebike&quot; (1984) and beat &#x27;em up &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; to create &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; (1985) for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). It went on to have a significant impact on the video game industry, establishing the conventions of the side-scrolling platformer sub-genre and helping to reinvigorate the North American home video game market (after it had crashed in 1983).

Alongside side-scrollers, rail shooters and light gun shooters also became popular during the mid-to-late 1980s. Popular examples include first-person light gun shooting gallery games such as Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Duck Hunt&quot; (1984), pseudo-3D third-person rail shooters such as Sega&#x27;s &quot;Space Harrier&quot; (1985) and &quot;After Burner&quot; (1987), and Taito&#x27;s &quot;Operation Wolf&quot; (1987) which popularized military-themed first-person light gun rail shooters.

===1990s===
A trend that was popularized for action games in the early 1990s was competitive multiplayer, including what would later be known as esports tournaments. The arcade fighting game &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; (1991) by Capcom popularized the concept of direct, tournament-level competition between two players. Previously, action games most often relied on high scores to determine the best player, but this changed with &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, where players would instead challenge each other directly, &quot;face-to-face,&quot; to determine the best player, paving the way for the competitive multiplayer and deathmatch modes found in modern action games. Inspired by &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, along with the SNK fighting games &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; (1991) and &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; (1992), John Romero created the deathmatch mode in id Software&#x27;s &quot;Doom&quot; (1993), which popularized competitive multiplayer online games.

In the 1990s, there was a &quot;3D Revolution&quot; where action games made the transition from 2D and pseudo-3D graphics to real-time 3D polygon graphics. 3D arcade system boards that were originally designed for 3D racing games during the late 1980s to early 1990s, such as the Namco System 21, Sega Model 1 and Sega Model 2, were used to produce 3D arcade action games in the early 1990s, including 3D rail shooters such as Namco&#x27;s &quot;Galaxian 3&quot; (1990) and &quot;Solvalou&quot; (1991), 3D fighting games such as Sega AM2&#x27;s &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; (1993) and Namco&#x27;s &quot;Tekken&quot; (1994), and 3D light gun shooters such as Sega AM2&#x27;s &quot;Virtua Cop&quot; (1994) and Namco&#x27;s &quot;Time Crisis&quot; (1995).

On personal computers, the first-person shooter (FPS) genre was popularized by &quot;Doom&quot;; it is also considered, despite not using 3D polygons, a major leap forward for three-dimensional environments in action games. 3D polygon texture mapping appeared in action games around the mid-1990s, introduced to fighting games by Sega AM2&#x27;s &quot;Virtua Fighter 2&quot; (1994), to light gun shooters by Sega AM2&#x27;s &quot;Virtua Cop&quot; in 1994, and to FPS games by Parallax Software&#x27;s &quot;Descent&quot; (1995).

<text>The Cadillac Escalade is a full-size luxury SUV manufactured by General Motors and marketed by their luxury division Cadillac. It was the luxury brand&#x27;s first major entry into the SUV market. The Escalade was introduced for the 1999 model year in response to an influx of new luxury SUVs in the late 1990s such as the Mercedes-Benz M-Class, Range Rover, Lexus LX, and (especially) Ford&#x27;s 1998 debut of the Lincoln Navigator. The Escalade project went into production only ten months after it was approved. The Escalade is built in Arlington, Texas. The term &quot;escalade&quot; refers to a siege warfare tactic of scaling defensive walls or ramparts with the aid of ladders or siege towers. More generally, it is a French word which is the noun-equivalent form of the French verb &quot;escalader&quot;, which means &quot;to climb or scale&quot;.

The Escalade is currently sold in North America and select international markets (Europe and Asia) where Cadillac has official sales channels. The Escalade ESV (Escalade Stretch Vehicle) is sold in North America, Russia, and the Middle East, but is only available by special order in some international markets. The right-hand-drive Escalade and Escalade ESV are available through third-party conversion specialists without official agreement with Cadillac in Australian, Oceanic, and Japanese markets.

On August 8, 2023, GM unveiled the Escalade IQ, an all-electric version of the Escalade, and the third model in Cadillac&#x27;s EV line, after the Celestiq, and Lyriq. It is expected to go on sale in late 2024 for the 2025 model year, with a starting price of $130,000.

The Escalade has gone through five generations, the most recent (the fifth) revealed in 2021. It was praised by critics for its technology and self-driving capability. The fifth generation Escalade is nearly two metres high, and was criticized by &quot;The Verge&quot; for its excessive size and hazard to pedestrians.

==First generation (1998)==
The introduction of the Lincoln Navigator in the 1998 model year necessitated that General Motors be able to compete in the burgeoning American market for full-size luxury-type trucks. This generation was only a five-seat (two-row) SUV. Fearing the growing hegemony of the Lincoln Navigator, the Escalade was rushed through the design process to reach dealers quickly. Essentially little more than a badge-engineered GMC Yukon Denali, the SUV&#x27;s aesthetics were similar to the Denali and the final vehicle was smaller than the Navigator. The Escalade&#x27;s underpinnings were borrowed from the Yukon Denali line, with the GMC logos on the center caps replaced with Cadillac&#x27;s crest. The Escalade also used the same 5.7L &quot;Vortec 5700&quot; V8 at as found in all other GMT400-based models, which was underpowered compared to the Navigator&#x27;s and 5.4L InTech V8. All first-generation Escalades and Denalis featured Auto-Trac selectable 4×4. The 1999–2000 Escalade achieved city and highway based on U.S. EPA test protocols.

The first-generation Escalade (as well as its mechanically identical twin, the GMC Yukon Denali), was available only in the short-wheelbase 4-door wagon configuration with few options. The GMC Yukon Denali was heavily differentiated from the standard Yukon models with a unique front hood, fenders, grille, headlamps, and bumper cover, color-keyed mirrors and door handles, a unique paint-matched roof rack and running boards, and lower paint-matched cladding all around with embossed emblems. The only exterior differences for the Cadillac Escalade (other than badging) were a slightly different grille treatment and smooth cladding with emblems placed on the sheet metal. The interior design, however, would differ significantly between the two models. Denali already added unique two-tone seats, genuine zebrano wood trim on the front-window switch panels and unique center console, chromed interior door handles, &quot;Yukon Denali&quot; embroidery on the door panels, a color keyed steering wheel, and a unique instrument cluster versus the standard Yukon. Escalade would add additional real wood trim on all four door panels and steering wheel, imitation wood on the instrument panel, and &quot;Cadillac&quot; script on the console veneer, a color-keyed steering column, leather-wrapped column shifter, and unique front and rear seats with perforated leather, a Cadillac crest embroidered on the headrests, and a storage compartment in the rear seat armrest.

Both vehicles included a generous amount of standard equipment not available on other GM full-size SUVs, including 16-inch chrome-clad aluminum-alloy wheels, a Bose Acoustimass seven-speaker stereo (including subwoofer), an in-dash CD player and console-mounted six-CD changer, auto-dimming exterior and rearview mirrors with compass and temperature display, automatic headlamps with daytime running lights, front projector fog lamps, heated front and rear seats, rear-seat audio controls, a BCM (body control module) providing functions such as retained accessory power and interior illumination fade-off, a unique warning chime, a special coating used on the dashboard for a more premium appearance, front and rear Bilstein shock absorbers, and unique engine and transmission tuning for a more refined driving experience. An OnStar in-vehicle telematics and communications system was optional on the Denali but standard on the Escalade, with the only other option for both models being a choice between twin rear barn doors or a split tailgate with rear-window wiper. A dealer-installed cellular telephone was also available with factory provisions in the center console.

Colors available on the Escalade were &quot;Silver Sand Metallic&quot;, &quot;Sable Black&quot;, &quot;Aspen White&quot;, and &quot;Bordeaux Red Metallic&quot;. All Escalades came with a &quot;Neutral Shale&quot; interior. Yukon Denali colors shared with the Escalade were named &quot;Black Onyx&quot; and &quot;Dark Toreador Red Metallic&quot;, and exclusive colors to the Denali were &quot;Silvermist Metallic&quot;, &quot;Spruce Green Metallic&quot;, &quot;Meadow Green Metallic&quot;, and &quot;Gold Metallic&quot;. The Denali featured a two-tone interior available in &quot;Canyon Tan&quot; or &quot;Stone Gray&quot;.

While base MSRP of the 2000 GMC Yukon Denali increased to US$43,535 (up $460 from $43,075 in 1999), the Cadillac Escalade retained a base MSRP of $46,225 in both 1999 and 2000.

General Motors retains the first Cadillac Escalade produced at Arlington Assembly in 1998, a 1999 &quot;Aspen White&quot; model, in its Heritage Collection, VIN # 400001.

==Second generation (2001)==
Unlike its Chevrolet and GMC siblings, which launched for the 2000 model year, Cadillac delayed the Escalade&#x27;s switch to the GMT820 chassis until February 2001 as a 2002 model, the last of the three General Motors full-size truck and SUV brands to switch to the new chassis; Cadillac unveiled the 2002 model year Escalade in August 2000 at Pebble Beach, while continuing to sell the 2000 models. Rear-wheel drive was standard, as was a 5.3L V8. All-wheel drive was standard on the ESV (until 2008 for the third generation) and EXT, and was optional on the short-wheelbase Escalade. The special high-output Vortec 6.0L V8 engine was the sole engine choice on all-wheel-drive models, and from mid-year 2005, all Escalades came with the high-output 6.0L Vortec V8. All models (except for the EXT) offered seating up to eight passengers.

For 2003, the &quot;StabiliTrak&quot; electronic stability control system was upgraded to a four-wheel version, and High Intensity Discharge (HID) low beam headlights, power-adjustable pedals, and turn-signal mirrors became standard, along with a Bulgari-branded clock. For 2004, XM Satellite Radio, second-row bucket seats, and a tire pressure monitoring system were made standard on all Escalades except the EXT. Also in 2004, the Platinum edition Escalade ESV was introduced at a base price of $71,025 (). It featured the luxury utility segment&#x27;s first factory-installed 20-inch chrome wheels, a chrome grille, a slightly lowered suspension, and an interior with an ebony-and-shale dashboard, shale leather upholstery, pleated door panel bolsters, heated and cooled seats (front and back), heated and cooled cup holders, moon roof, and second- and third-row monitors. The OnStar system was upgraded for the 2005 model year from an analog to a digital system.

In 2003, a year after their introduction, the GMT800-based Cadillac Escalade and Escalade EXT received an interior facelift, while the exterior design was left mostly unchanged. The audio system was upgraded to offer two different radio options: an AM/FM radio with cassette and single-disc CD players, or an AM/FM radio with a single-disc CD player and a touchscreen GPS navigation system (Radio Data System was also included with both radios). Both radio options included a separate six-disc, in-dash CD changer unit mounted in the lower portion of the instrument panel and controlled via the radio (the CD changer still featured numbered buttons for disc selection, as well as &quot;Load&quot; and &quot;Eject&quot; buttons). The Driver Information Center (DIC) was moved from a separate unit in the instrument panel to the odometer display screen in the instrument cluster, where the gauges were also revised with the larger odometer display screen. XM Satellite Radio became available, and the OnStar telematics system controls were relocated from the instrument panel to the electrochromic inside rearview mirror (ISRV). A rear-seat DVD entertainment system, which included two pairs of wireless headphones, and was produced by Panasonic, was also a new option for the 2003 model year. The instrument panel and steering wheel both featured updated designs (the steering wheel now also featured a remote audio system, OnStar, and speed cruise control buttons on the front of the wheel). The electrochromic inside rearview mirror (ISRV) now integrated the OnStar system controls in addition to the exterior (outside) temperature display and integrated directional compass. The front and second and third-row seat designs were updated, and the Zebrano interior trim was replaced with Burlwood. The Escalade ESV (extended-length model) also debuted for the 2003 model year. Finally, the warning chimes now played through the front driver&#x27;s door speaker, as opposed to a separately mounted chime module on 2002 models.

===Engines===
* 2002–2003 5.3L LM7 &quot;Vortec&quot; V8, (VIN code T)
* 2004–2005 5.3L LM7 &quot;Vortec&quot; V8, (VIN code T)
* 2002–2006 6.0L LQ9 &quot;HO Vortec&quot; V8, (VIN code N)

==Third generation (2006)==

The Escalade moved to the new GMT900 platform for the 2007 model year, along with all of its companion models (Silverado, Sierra, Suburban, Tahoe, Avalanche, Yukon, Yukon XL, and Yukon Denali), which were launched simultaneously. The regular Escalade was again joined by the stretched &quot;ESV&quot; version and &quot;EXT&quot; sport utility truck. The 2007 Escalade was the official vehicle of Super Bowl XL, with MVP Hines Ward being awarded one of the first Escalades produced. The design also includes vertical headlights again, now more closely influenced by GM&#x27;s own GMC Yukon from the same year and/of generation.

Production of the redesigned Escalade began at Arlington Assembly in January 2006. It was priced from US$57,280, though the rear-wheel-drive version at this price was not produced until August. The more expensive all-wheel-drive version was produced first, followed by the long-wheelbase &quot;ESV&quot; and &quot;EXT&quot; pickup (the latter sourced from the Silao, Mexico, plant) in June.

The Escalade uses an all-aluminum 6.2L &quot;Vortec&quot; V8. This is the industry&#x27;s first mass-produced pushrod engine with variable valve timing. The system adjusts both intake and exhaust timing between two settings. The engine produces (23 hp more than its sister competitor, the GMC Yukon Denali) and of torque. A new six-speed 6L80 automatic transmission is used. The new body completes a 0.363 drag coefficient. In 2010, the Cadillac Escalade&#x27;s base price was $62,500 for a RWD model, and $65,200 for an AWD model. The northeast accounts for 60 percent of Escalade sales. The 2013 short-wheelbase 2WD model has an EPA-estimated fuel economy rating of , combined , and highway .

===Engines===
: 2007–2014: 6.2L &quot;Vortec 6200&quot; V8,

A two-mode hybrid version debuted at the 2008 South Florida International Auto Show in Miami, and went on sale in 2008 as a 2009 model at a starting price of $74,085 for a two-wheel-drive model. In August 2008, 20% of Cadillac Escalade sales were hybrids.

The Escalade Hybrid takes 8.2 seconds to accelerate from 0 to . The Hybrid is powered by a 6.0-liter V8. It is joined by two 60-kilowatt electric motors supplied by a nickel–metal hydride battery pack under the rear seat. On its own, the V8 is rated at at 5,100 rpm and at 4,100 rpm. GM engineers claim that combined output with the electric motors is . The unique transmission houses the electric motors along with three different planetary gear sets and four traditional clutches.

==Fourth generation (2014)==

On October 7, 2013, Cadillac unveiled the fourth generation Escalade and Escalade ESV at a star-studded event in New York City, just nearly a month after GM unveiled their next-generation SUVs from Chevrolet and GMC. Cadillac began its campaign to promote the Escalade on August 14, 2013, and started posting teasers online on September 23, 2013, with help from the photographer Autumn de Wilde, who helped reveal more images ahead of the unveiling. A YouTube page called &quot;Escalade Reveal&quot; was set up to showcase the videos along with the countdown to the unveiling. On November 25, 2013, Cadillac began spreading the word of mouth about the 2015 Escalade by placing a front facsimile cutout of the vehicle on display at Saks Fifth Avenue&#x27;s New York City flagship store during its annual Christmas promotional campaign, which shows the SUV being frozen in wraps.

Production on the 2015 Escalade began in January 2014 at GM&#x27;s Arlington, Texas, assembly plant and went on sale in April 2014 as a 2015 model (with the MSRP starting at around $71,000 for standard-length, $74,000 for ESV), and available in only three trims: Base, Luxury, and Premium. International sales were scheduled to start in the summer of 2014. They are assigned to the GMT K2XX platform as K2XL. &quot;The 2015 Escalade exterior light signature draws inspiration from a variety of sources, beginning with Cadillac’s heritage of vertical exterior lamps and extending into architecture,&quot; said Exterior Lighting Design Manager Martin Davis.

The Escalade was planned to switch to the unibody Lambda platform but was quickly nixed because of customer aversion. According to a report on Autoblog.com, GM had reissued a redesign on the GM full-size SUV lineup, including the Escalade, for a 2014 release in response to increased SUV sales, and was working on its full-size SUV replacements, which would see a possible change in the Escalade&#x27;s SUV platform. But in July 2013, a series of spy shots revealed that GM would keep the Escalade a body-on-frame SUV. However, GM is looking at expanding the Escalade brand to the large CUV segment, which would see a vehicle using the Escalade badge sharing the same platform as the Chevrolet Traverse and GMC Acadia, which is in the planning stages. According to VP Bob Ferguson, Cadillac&#x27;s first three-row Escalade CUV could be introduced in 2016. There is also a possibility that GM might export the Escalade to Australia as a right-hand drive vehicle as part of Cadillac&#x27;s global expansion, as GM has begun to import its North American vehicles to its Holden division there after discontinuing the latter&#x27;s locally produced models in 2017.

The cargo space was reduced from to on the standard model and from to on the ESV in order to allow an additional 1.7 inches of headroom and 45.3 inches of legroom in the front while reducing the third-row legroom space from to . GM&#x27;s 6.2-liter EcoTec3 V8, good for 420 horsepower and 460 pound-feet of torque, mated to a six-speed automatic transmission (2015i models and beyond are 8-Speed Automatics), is the only engine offered, along with a new coil-over front suspension and five-link rear setup, a wider track, variable-assist electric power steering and Cadillac&#x27;s Magnetic Ride Control system with Tour and Sport modes. The interior now has a hand-crafted design that features cut-and-sewn and wrapped materials, with wood trim options. The dashboard was also updated, and the Cadillac CUE system is added as a standard feature, along with an updated security system.

The 2015 Escalade lineup received an 8-speed transmission, surround view camera, and 4G LTE connectivity as part of a mid-year refresh, which also saw the wreaths on the grille disappear from the Escalade as part of Cadillac&#x27;s plans to update the logo to emphasize the crest on all of its models.

The only changes made were the deletion of the &quot;Manhattan Noir Metallic&quot; and &quot;Bronze Dune Metallic&quot; colors and the addition of the &quot;Dark Mocha Metallic&quot; color. The dealer-ordered Escalade Noir package was also eliminated after being offered for only a year.

GM had proposed a facelift for the 2020 model that would have featured a grille resembling that of the Cadillac XT6, but the proposal was scrapped in favor of the next-generation model that would debut for the 2021 model year.

===Hennessey HPE550===
In 2014, Hennessey Performance Engineering offered a HPE550 supercharger upgrade to fourth generation Escalade customers, which included a belt-driven supercharger, air-to-water intercooler, recalibrated engine management software and a three-year/36,000 mile powertrain warranty, a boost that will increase the 6.2L engine&#x27;s performance to and of torque, and 20-inch lightweight H10 forged Monoblock wheels, to further improve performance. The upgrades, once they are ordered by customers, have a set price of $15,950.

===International version===
In July 2015, GM reached a deal with Unison SP ZAO in Minsk, Belarus, to build and assemble the Escalade and Escalade ESV for the Russian and CIS markets. This version was similar to the Chevrolet Tahoe, featuring the 6.2L V8 EcoTec3 engine and the Tahoe&#x27;s semi-CKD assembled designs; the ESV also marked the first time an extended-length base model had been offered in this region. It was available in 4WD models only and carried a MSRP of 4.34 million rubles (US$76,984) for standard-size and 4.59 million rubles (US$81,383) for ESV.

===Critical reception===
The reviews for the fourth generation Escalade&#x27;s redesign have been met with positive results from automotive critics. &quot;USA Today&#x27;s&quot; James R. Healey and Fred Meier noted that &quot;The once-unthinkable big Cadillac SUV has become indispensable.&quot; CNET&#x27;s Antuan Goodwin notes that &quot;Fans of the Escalade will appreciate the automaker&#x27;s sticking with the original message and not &quot;ruining&quot; its former flagship, but if you already think the giant luxury SUV is a relic of the past, there&#x27;s nothing in the 2015 Escalade that will convince you that it&#x27;s anything but an old dog that&#x27;s learned a few cool new tricks.&quot; &quot;Carscoops&quot; noted that &quot;It may have impressed us more if a) it had shown the Escalade first instead of last, after the Chevrolet and GMC models or b) if the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban and GMC Yukon and Yukon XL simply did not exist…&quot; and added that Cadillac has won their attention with the redesign. Scott Burgess of &quot;Motor Trend&quot; summed up the redesign in its headline, saying its &quot;It&#x27;s bigger, it&#x27;s bolder and it&#x27;s more beautiful.&quot; Bill Visnic of &quot;Edmunds&quot; concluded in his review that &quot;With subtle, new sheet metal refreshingly free of styling gimmicks, Cadillac&#x27;s looking to the 2015 Escalade&#x27;s all-new and upgraded interior to help it retain its role as the benchmark of bling SUVs.&quot; The vehicle received a positive review by &quot;Autoblog&quot; contributor Michael Hartley, who took a road trip with a standard 4WD full-size trim from Los Angeles to Monterey, California. Although Hartley was skeptical at first, he came away impressed: &quot;A 600-mile trip in the Escalade left me convinced that it has the features, build quality and driving dynamics to strike new fear in the segment.&quot; Bloomberg News, in its March 27, 2015 review, cited the Escalade as one of the best American-built SUVs ever made, adding that when comparing it to its foreign competitors, &quot;It&#x27;s the best we make.&quot;

GM recently hired Infiniti&#x27;s Johan de Nysschen to serve as Cadillac president and help revitalize the brand. June 2014 shipments showed Cadillac down a few percent for the year; however, the Escalade was among the biggest winners with a 74 percent sales jump and was one of Cadillac&#x27;s best sellers the following July. As of March 2015, both standard and ESV Escalades had contributed to massive sales with the full-size Escalade seeing a 117% increase and the ESV soaring to 114% overall.

On August 20, 2014, &quot;Automotive News&quot; and &quot;Autoblog&quot; began reporting that Cadillac dealers have been waiting three times longer than usual—a month or more—from the time an Escalade leaves the assembly line to when it gets delivered, saying they do not always know where their vehicles are in transit, or when they are set to arrive, upsetting customers who have put down deposits, leading to Cadillac dealerships to reportedly stop taking pre-orders. Even customers who placed orders as far as February 2014 are still waiting for the vehicles according to the dealerships&#x27; owners. Cadillac blames the delays on two weeks of &quot;dwell time,&quot; citing &quot;a lengthy quality-assurance process on some interior parts&quot; that caused the lag, as well as additional issues with figuring out which vehicles should be delivered first. Despite the setback, Cadillac does plan to correct the issues with adding more employees and speed up production at the Arlington plant.

On March 16, 2016, &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; named the 2016 Escalade the worst large luxury SUV in its annual rankings, with an overall score of 44. Most of the criticism came from its room space, second-row seating, the CUE media system, stopping, stiff road handling, and its redesign, calling it the worst in class.

===Recalls===
In May 2014, GM recalled 1,402 units of the 2015 Escalade and Escalade ESV that were built between January 2014 to May 2014 because of &quot;an insufficiently heated plastic weld that attaches the (front) passenger side air bag to the instrument panel assembly could result in a partial deployment of the air bag in the event of a crash.&quot; GM also placed a temporary halt on further sales and informed owners of the affected vehicles to not let passengers sit in the front passenger seat until they are replaced.

== Fifth generation (2020) ==
The fifth-generation Escalade debuted on February 4, 2020, in Beverly Hills, California, for the 2021 model year, with sales commencing in the fall of 2020. Although production of the 2021 Escalade was pushed back as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, GM had the vehicle scheduled to hit dealerships as planned. Dealers started taking pre-orders on April 23, 2020. To hype up the Escalade, Cadillac launched a 3D visualizer showcasing the vehicle. This visualizer lets the user interact with the Escalade and Escalade ESV by turning on the lights, changing the color, changing the rims, and looking at the interior.

The fifth-generation Escalade is nearly two metres tall, and has a very large blind spot (more than ten feet), one of the highest of popular cars.

The fifth-generation Escalade is built on the GMT1XX platform, sharing it with the Chevrolet Tahoe/GMC Yukon and Chevrolet Suburban/GMC Yukon XL, and have a front grille design similar to the one used on Cadillac&#x27;s XT crossovers. This new platform gives the Escalade and its stable mates independent rear suspension, a first for the model. This changes also allows the vehicle to increase its passenger and cargo space due to the more efficient design.

In December 2019, Cadillac unveiled a teaser video that featured a 38-inch curved OLED screen dashboard that displayed the Cadillac crest (on the driver&#x27;s side) and “Escalade” name (across the passenger side), making this version the most unique in the Cadillac roster. This enabled Cadillac to boast of its &quot;industry-first curved OLED screen technology&quot; with &quot;twice the pixel density of a 4K television.&quot; Augmented reality–enabled navigation was also introduced as a new feature available on the Escalade. On January 28, 2020, Cadillac introduced the &quot;Super Cruise&quot; feature, allowing for hands-free self-driving. This was followed by on January 31, 2020, of the addition of the turbodiesel 3.0L LM2 inline six-cylinder Duramax engine as a no-charge option, badged as &quot;600D&quot; in line with the automaker&#x27;s new naming convention. The Escalade is the first diesel-powered Cadillac offered in North America since the 1985 DeVille, Eldorado, Seville and Fleetwood, which were available with an Oldsmobile-developed Oldsmobile Diesel engine#V8 engines by RPO code 5.7 Liter V8. On the outside, it is longer than the previous Escalade and has more passenger room (particularly for the second- and third-row occupants) and cargo space.
There are five trim levels available on the fifth generation Escalade: Luxury, Premium Luxury, Sport, Premium Luxury Platinum, and Sport Platinum. The interior choices consist of eight trim options and four seating designs. The AKG audio technology system is new, featuring 36 speakers throughout the cabin.

In November 2020, General Motors announced that the 5th gen Cadillac Escalade will be offered in Japan from 2021. It is available in standard length, two trim levels (Sport Platinum and Premium Luxury Platinum).

===Critical reception===
&quot;Car and Driver&quot; praised the model for its high-tech self driving program and impressive display in addition to the available diesel that tested at 27 mpg on the highway. &quot;Motor Trend&quot; additionally had positive comments on the Escalade especially the cabin. They describe the optional 36-speaker AKG sound system as &quot;among the best car audio systems on the market, period&quot; for its lifelike sound. Despite the positive comments, it came in second place in a comparison test released shortly after the release of the 2021 model.

Andrew J. Hawkins, writing for &quot;The Verge&quot;, described driving the Escalade as &quot;one of the most stressful driving experiences I&#x27;ve ever had,&quot; criticizing its excessive size and the hazard it poses to pedestrians and other road users.

===Escalade ESV===
The 2021 Escalade ESV debuted online in April 2020, but its physical unveiling, including one scheduled for the New York International Auto Show was cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic. It featured a unique fascia along with the passenger doors and wider exhaust pipes. In November 2020, GM announced that their large SUV lineup would be imported to China. The Escalade ESV was to mark its maiden entry into the country, starting with the fifth-generation models, but GM put those plans on hold in February 2021, citing the difficulty of having an import sold alongside its Chinese-built offerings, the makeup of the facilities that would be required to assemble the large full-size SUVs, and concerns that the full-size SUVs would not be able to comply with China&#x27;s emission standards, as well as concerns that China&#x27;s internal combustion engine excise taxes imposed on all vehicles sold in China that are powered by ICE engines more than 3.0 liters will hurt sales of GM&#x27;s large full-size SUVs in the East Asian country.

===Escalade-V===
Cadillac launched the performance version of the Escalade in 2022, called the Escalade-V. The Escalade-V is the largest performance SUV in the American market. It uses a 6.2-liter V8 supercharged engine. With an output of and a of torque, it is equipped with a 10-speed automatic transmission, and acceleration from takes only 4.4 seconds. The vehicle features a full-time all-wheel drive system, so engine power is always being distributed to both axles. Normally set up for a 50/50 torque distribution, V-mode allows the AWD to be tailored to the desired setting of the driver. The torque split front-to-rear can be adjusted between a ratio of 50/50 in Snow, 40/60 in Tour, and 30/70 in Sport. The suggested price starts at $149,990. There is also a longer wheelbase model available as the Escalade-V ESV, (sometimes referred to as the Escalade ESV-V or the V-series Escalade ESV).

=== 2024 facelift ===
General Motors released the facelift model for the Escalade on July 17, 2024 for the 2025 model year. The changes include a new front fascia with vertical headlights borrowed from the Escalade IQ, a new illuminated crest logo on the grille, a new illuminated grille surround, the rear fascia receives new taillights and new bumper, new exterior colors, new alloy wheel designs, and 24-inch alloy wheels are featured on the Escalade for the first time. Inside, the interior was redesigned to feature elements from the Escalade IQ such as the new curved 55-inch display integrates both the driver and passenger displays, a new secondary lower screen used to control the vehicle settings, a new steering wheel, a new column-mounted shifter for the automatic transmission, a new Executive Second Row package which includes a center console with a rear command center and two 12.6-inch touchscreen displays, new electrically operated side doors, and new interior color themes.

The rear wheels are linked to the steering wheel, turning up to 10 degrees either opposite (at low speeds) or in the same direction as the front wheels (at highway speeds) and permitting diagonal travel similar to the Hummer EV&#x27;s &quot;crabwalk&quot; mode.

==Cadillac Escalade EXT==
===1st generation (2002–2006)===
The Escalade &quot;EXT&quot; sport utility truck (released alongside its twin, the Chevrolet Avalanche) was introduced in 2001 (as a 2002 model) by the Cadillac division of General Motors.

<text>The Cadillac Eldorado is a luxury car manufactured and marketed by Cadillac from 1952 until 2002 over twelve generations.

The Eldorado was at or near the top of the Cadillac line. The original 1953 Eldorado convertible and the Eldorado Brougham models of 1957–1960 had distinct bodyshells and were the most expensive models that Cadillac offered those years. The Eldorado was never less than second in price after the Cadillac Series 75 limousine until 1966. Starting in 1967 the Eldorado retained its premium position in the Cadillac price structure, but was manufactured in high volumes on a unique, two-door personal luxury car platform.

The Eldorado carried the Fleetwood designation from 1965 through 1972, and was a modern revival of the pre-war Cadillac V-12 and Cadillac V-16 roadsters and convertibles.

==Name==
The nameplate &quot;&quot; is a contraction of two Spanish words that translate as &quot;the gilded (i.e., golden) one&quot;—and also refers to El Dorado, the mythical Colombian &quot;Lost City of Gold&quot; that fascinated Spanish explorers.

Chosen in an internal competition for a 1952 concept vehicle celebrating Cadillac&#x27;s golden anniversary, the name &quot;Eldorado&quot; was subsequently adopted for a limited-edition convertible for model year 1953.

Cadillac began using the nameplates &quot;Eldorado Seville&quot;, after the city in southern Spain, and &quot;Eldorado Biarritz&quot; after the luxury seaside resort in southern France, to distinguish between the hardtop and convertible models (respectively) while both were offered, from 1956 through 1960 inclusively. The &quot;Seville&quot; name was dropped when the hardtop was initially discontinued (1961), but the Biarritz name continued through 1964. Beginning in 1965, the Eldorado became the &#x27;Fleetwood Eldorado&#x27;. &#x27;Biarritz&#x27; returned as an up level trim package for the Eldorado for 1976 until 1991. 

==First generation (1953)==

The Cadillac Series 62 Eldorado joined the Oldsmobile 98 Fiesta, and Buick Roadmaster Skylark as top-of-the-line, limited-production specialty convertibles introduced in 1953 by General Motors to promote its design leadership. A special-bodied, low-production convertible (532 units in total), it was the production version of the 1952 El Dorado &quot;Golden Anniversary&quot; concept car. Along with borrowing bumper bullets from the 1951 GM Le Sabre show car, it featured a full assortment of deluxe accessories and introduced the wraparound windshield and a cut-down beltline to Cadillac standard production.

The expansive frontal glass and distinctive dip in the sheet metal at the bottom of the side windows (featured on one or both of GM&#x27;s other 1953 specialty convertibles) were especially beloved by General Motors&#x27; styling chief Harley Earl and subsequently widely copied by other marques. Available in four unique colors; Aztec Red, Alpine White, Azure Blue and Artisan Ochre. Convertible tops were available in either black or white Orlon. AC was an option at US$620 ($ in dollars ), as were wire wheels for US$325 ($ in dollars ). The car carried no special badging other than a gold-colored &quot;Eldorado&quot; nameplate in the center of the dash. A hard tonneau cover, flush with the rear deck, hid the convertible top when stored.

Although technically a subseries of the Cadillac Series 62 based on the regular Series 62 convertible and sharing its engine, it was nearly twice as expensive at US$7,750 ($ in dollars ) as the all-new Packard Caribbean convertible.

The long, wide vehicle came with such standard features as windshield washers, a signal seeking radio, power windows, and a heater. Only 532 were produced, comprising just 0.5% of Cadillac&#x27;s 1953 sales.

==Second generation (1954–1956)==
In 1954, the Eldorado lost its unique sheetmetal in an effort by GM to lower its price in order to increase sales. Now sharing its basic body shell with standard Cadillacs, it was distinguished mainly by trim pieces, including golden identifying crests centered directly behind the air-slot fender breaks, and wide fluted beauty panels to decorate the lower rear sides. These panels were made of extruded aluminum, and also appeared on a one of a kind Eldorado coupé built for the Reynolds Aluminum Corporation. Also included in the production Eldorado convertible were monogram plates on the doors, wire wheels, and custom interior trimmings with the Cadillac crest embossed on the seat bolsters. Sales nearly quadrupled at a much more modest US$5,738 base price (equivalent to $ in dollars ), with a total of 2,150 Eldorados sold.

For 1955, the Eldorado&#x27;s body gained its own rear end styling with somewhat higher, more slender, and distinctly pointed tailfins, a styling change that portended extreme exaggerations to come. The Eldorado sport convertible featured extras such as wide chrome body belt moldings and twin round taillights halfway up the fenders. Sales nearly doubled to 3,950.

For 1956, a two-door hardtop coupé version was released, called the &quot;Eldorado Seville&quot;, and a two-door convertible named &quot;Eldorado Biarritz&quot;. An Eldorado script appeared with fender crest on the car, which was further distinguished by twin hood ornaments. An extra feature on the Eldorado convertible was a ribbed chrome saddle molding extending from the windshield to the rear window pillar along the beltline. With the addition of the Seville, sales rose yet again, by 60% to 6,050 of which 2,150 were Sevilles. Still the division&#x27;s halo car, Eldorados accounted for just 4% of all Cadillacs sold.

==Third generation (1957–1958)==
Cadillac was restyled and re-engineered for 1957, with stylistic updates in 1958.

===1957===
1957 saw the Eldorado (in both Biarritz convertible and Seville hardtop body styles) receive new styling with an exclusive rear-end design featuring a low, downswept fenderline capped by pointed in-board fins. Just behind the open rear wheel housings the lower rear quarters were trimmed with broad, sculptured stainless steel beauty panels that visually blended into the split rear wraparound bumper assemblies. A form of this unique rear-end treatment first appeared (sans fins) on the Cadillac &quot;Interceptor&quot; prototype from the immediate post-war era. Series 62 Eldorados (as distinct from the Series 70 Eldorado Brougham) were further distinguished by the model name above a V-shaped rear deck ornament and on the front fenders. The three section front bumper was shared with the rest of the redesigned Cadillac model line, as in previous years the Eldorados came with a long list of standard features. Four specially-built 4-door hardtop Eldorado Sevilles were also built in 1957.

===1958===
For 1958, the car received quad headlights as the front clip was again shared with this year&#x27;s updated standard Cadillacs. GM was promoting their fiftieth year of production, and introduced Anniversary models for each brand; Cadillac, Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and Chevrolet. The 1958 models shared a common appearance on the top models for each brand; Cadillac Eldorado Seville, Buick Limited Riviera, Oldsmobile Starfire 98, Pontiac Bonneville Catalina, and the all-new Chevrolet Bel-Air Impala.

This year&#x27;s revised front clip incorporated a new hood, a new front bumper with &quot;dagmars&quot; mounted lower and further apart combined with a full width jeweled grille. On the Biarritz and Seville, a V-shaped ornament and model identification script was asymmetrically mounted to the deck lid. Other styling updates included the addition of ten vertical chrome slashes ahead of the open rear wheel housings and crest medallions on the flank of the tailfins. The split rear bumper assemblies were each updated with a low-profile combined reverse light/grille unit that replaced the previous year&#x27;s separate, round exhaust exits and reverse lights; the round brake/tail light units at the base of the fins remained unchanged. The rear license plate housing was now flanked on each side by five vertical hash marks.

===1957–1958 Eldorado Brougham===
Announced in December 1956 and released around March 1957, the &quot;Series 70 Eldorado Brougham&quot; was a distinct, hand-built four-door ultra-luxury vehicle, derived from the Park Avenue and Orleans show cars of 1953–54. Designed by Ed Glowacke, Cadillac&#x27;s 1950s design studio head, it stood out by featuring the first quad headlights—at the time still illegal in the United States, and other unique trim, foremost a brushed stainless steel pillarless hardtop. Like the later 1961 fourth-generation Lincoln Continental, it had rear-hinged rear doors (suicide doors) but unlike the Continental, the Brougham was a true pillarless hardtop as the doors latched onto a stub pillar that did not extend beyond the beltline.

It cost US$13,074 ($ in dollars )—twice the price of a conventional 1957 Eldorado and more than competitors Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud, Facel Vega Excellence or Continental Mark II. Sales were 400 in 1957 and 304 in 1958. 1958 was the last year for the domestic production of the handbuilt Brougham at Cadillac&#x27;s Detroit factory, as future manufacturing of the special bodies was transferred to Pininfarina of Turin, Italy. It was a marketing approach revival used in the early 1930s with the Cadillac V-16 with similar attention to detail and engineering pursuits as a halo car.

The car featured a roof trimmed in brushed stainless and self leveling air suspension. The exterior ornamentation included wide, polished lower rear quarter beauty panels extending along the rocker sills and rectangularly sculptured side body &quot;cove&quot; highlighted with five horizontal windsplits on the rear doors. Tail styling treatments followed the Eldorado pattern. It also had the first automatic two-position &quot;memory&quot; power seats, a dual four-barrel V-8, low-profile tires with thin white-walls, automatic trunk opener and closer, high-pressure cooling system, polarized sun visors, electric antenna, electric door locks and a dual heating system. Other unique features included an automatic starter with restart function, Autronic Eye, drum-type electric clock, power windows, forged aluminum wheels and air conditioning, six silver magnetic glovebox drink tumblers and finally, an Evans leather trimmed cigarette case and vanity kit containing a lipstick holder, ladies&#x27; powder puff with powder, comb, beveled mirror, coin holder, matching leather notebook, gold mechanical pencil, and an atomizer filled with Arpège Extrait De Lanvin perfume. Buyers of Broughams had a choice of 44 full-leather interior and trim combinations and could select such items as Mouton, Karakul or lambskin carpeting.

There were serious difficulties with the air suspension, which proved troublesome in practice. Some owners found it cheaper to have it replaced with conventional coil springs than to keep repairing the air system.

The 1957 Eldorado Brougham joined the Sixty Special and the Series 75 as the only Cadillac models with Fleetwood bodies although Fleetwood script or crests did not appear anywhere on the exterior of the car, and so this would also mark the first time in 20 years that a Fleetwood-bodied car was paired with the Brougham name.

The 1957-58 Eldorado Brougham also marked the return of the Cadillac Series 70, if only briefly. An all-transistor signal-seeking car radio was produced by GM&#x27;s Delco radio and was first available for the 1957 Eldorado Brougham models, which was standard equipment and used 13 transistors in its circuitry.

The Eldorado Brougham received minor changes for 1958. The interior upper door panels were finished in leather instead of the metal finish used in 1957. New wheel covers also appeared. Forty-four trim combinations were available, along with 15 special monotone paint colors.


==Fourth generation (1959–1960)==
===1959===
Along with the rest of the General Motors divisions, the bulky, originally proposed 1959 styling was abandoned in favor of a significantly lower, longer and wider theme as an overdue response to Virgil Exner&#x27;s striking redesign of the 1957 Chrysler products. The 1959 Cadillac is remembered for its huge sharp tailfins with dual bullet tail lights, two distinctive rooflines and roof pillar configurations, new jewel-like grille patterns and matching deck lid beauty panels.

For 1959, the Series 62 became the &quot;Series 6200&quot;. De Villes and two-door Eldorados were moved from the Series 62 to their own series, the &quot;Series 6300&quot; and &quot;Series 6400&quot; respectively, though they all, including the four-door Eldorado Brougham (which was moved from the Series 70 to &quot;Series 6900&quot;), shared the same wheelbase. New mechanical items were a &quot;scientifically engineered&quot; drainage system and new shock absorbers. All Eldorados were characterized by a three-deck, jeweled, rear grille insert that replicated the texture of the front grille; this front/rear grille treatment was shared with the Fleetwood Sixty Special and would continue through 1966 with textures being revised each year. The Seville and Biarritz models had the Eldorado name spelled out behind the front wheel opening and featured broad, full-length body sill highlights that curved over the rear fender profile and back along the upper beltline region. Engine output was an even from the engine. Standard equipment included power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, back-up lamps, windshield wipers, two-speed wipers, wheel discs, outside rearview mirror, vanity mirror, oil filter, power windows, six way power seats, heater, fog lamps, remote control deck lid, radio and antenna with rear speaker, power vent windows, air suspension, electric door locks and license frames. The Eldorado Brougham also came with air conditioning, automatic headlight dimmer, and cruise control standard over the Seville and Biarritz trim lines.

===1960===
1960 Cadillacs resemble 1959 Cadillacs, but with much lower tailfins and smoother, more restrained styling.

General changes included a full-width grille, the elimination of pointed front bumper guards, increased restraint in the application of chrome trim, lower tailfins minus the twin bullet taillamps, oval shaped nacelles and front fender mounted directional indicator lamps. External variations on the Seville two-door hardtop and Biarritz convertible took the form of bright body sill highlights that extended across the lower edge of fender skirts and Eldorado block lettering on the sides of the front fenders, just behind the headlamps. Standard equipment included power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, dual back-up lamps, windshield wipers, two-speed wipers, wheel discs, outside rearview mirror, vanity mirror, oil filter, power windows, six-way power seats, heater, fog lamps, Eldorado engine, remote control trunk lock, radio with antenna and rear speaker, power vent windows, air suspension, electric door locks, license frames, and five whitewall tires. Technical highlights were finned rear drums and an X-frame construction. Interiors were done in Chadwick cloth or optional Chambray cloth and leather combinations. The last Eldorado Seville was built in 1960.

The 1960 Cadillac Eldorado Biarritz 6467E is featured as Maurice Minnifield&#x27;s vehicle in the 1990s television series &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;.

===1959–60 Eldorado Brougham===
For model years 1959 and 1960, the Eldorado Brougham became longer, lower and wider. The Brougham featured narrow taillights integrated into low tailfins; an angular rear roofline with rear ventiplanes that contrasted to the rounded roofline; and the dual rocket-like taillights and tall fins of the standard 1959 models. Front and rear bumper assemblies were shared with the standard Cadillacs.

Designed in-house, Cadillac contracted with Pininfarina of Turin, Italy for the manufacture of the low-volume model. The Eldorado Broughams were among the first Cadillacs to be hand-built in Italy; concept cars were also hand built as needed. Cadillac chassis were sent by boat to the port of Savona, Italy where they were then delivered to the factory in Turin at Grugliasco, mated with the body and sent back to Detroit by boat.

Priced at $13,075 ($ in dollars ), the Brougham cost $1 more than their older siblings and did not sell as well as their forebears.

A vertical crest medallion with Brougham script plate appeared on the front fenders and a single, thin molding ran from the front to rear along the mid-sides of the body. The Brougham did not have Eldorado front fender letters or Eldorado-specific body edge highlight trim. For 1960 new standard model bumpers were incorporated and a fin-like crest or skeg ran from behind the front wheel opening to the rear of the car on the lower bodyside with the crest medallions relocated to the trailing edge of the rear fenders. The standard equipment list matched those of other Eldorados, plus Cruise Control, Autronic Eye, air conditioning and E-Z Eye glass.

The Eldorado Brougham was moved to its own unique Series 6900 from Series 70 for its remaining two years.


==Fifth generation (1961–1962)==
===1961===
All Cadillacs were restyled and re-engineered for 1961. The Eldorado Biarritz convertible (6367) was technically reclassified as a subseries of the De Ville (Series 6300), a status it would keep through 1964. An Eldorado convertible would remain in the Cadillac line through 1966, but its differences from the rest of the line would be generally more modest. The new convex jewelled grille slanted back towards both the bumper and the hood lip, along the horizontal plane, and sat between dual headlamps. New rear-slanting front pillars with a reverse-curved base as first used on the 1959-60 Broughams with a somewhat less expansive windshield was incorporated. The Eldorado Biarritz featured front series designation scripts and a lower body &quot;skeg&quot; trimmed with a thin three quarter length spear molding running from behind the front wheel opening to the rear of the car.
Standard equipment included power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, dual reverse lights, vanity mirror, power windows, 6-way power bench seat, power vent windows. whitewall tires. Options; bucket seats, RH outside rearview mirror remote control trunk lock and a trumpet horn.
Rubber-isolated front and rear coil springs replaced the trouble prone air suspension system. Four-barrel induction systems were now the sole power choice and dual exhaust were no longer available. With the Seville and Brougham gone, sales fell to 1,450.

===1962===
A mild facelift characterized Cadillac styling trends for 1962. A flatter, upright grille with a thicker horizontal center bar and more delicate cross-hatched insert appeared. Ribbed chrome trim panel, seen ahead of the front wheel housings in 1961, were now replaced with cornering lamps and front fender model and series identification badges were eliminated. More massive front bumper end pieces appeared and housed rectangular parking lamps. At the rear tail lamps were now housed in vertically oriented rectangular nacelles designed with an angled peak at the center. A vertically ribbed rear beauty panel replicating the grille treatment appeared on the deck lid latch panel. Cadillac script also appeared on the lower left side of the grille. Standard equipment included all of last year&#x27;s equipment plus remote controlled outside rearview mirror, heater and defroster and front cornering lamps. Cadillac refined the ride and quietness, with more insulation in the floor and behind the firewall.

==Sixth generation (1963–1964)==
===1963===
In 1963, the Eldorado Biarritz joined the Cadillac Sixty Special and the Cadillac Series 75 as the only Cadillac models with Fleetwood bodies, thus acquiring the Fleetwood wreath and crest on its rear quarters and Fleetwood rocker panel moldings. The 1963 Eldorado was also the first Fleetwood bodied convertible since the Cadillac Series 75 stopped offering four- and two-door convertible body styles and production of the Cadillac Series 90 (V16) ceased in 1941. In overall terms, the 1963 Cadillac was essentially the same as the previous year. The completely redesigned body imparted a bolder and more angular look. The front fenders projected 4.625 inches further forward than in 1962 while the tailfins were trimmed down somewhat to provide a lower profile. Body side sculpturing was eliminated in favor of smooth, flatter slab sides. The slightly V-shaped radiator grille was taller and now incorporated outer extensions that swept below the dual headlamps and housed small circular front parking lamps. The Eldorado also had a rectangular front and rear grille pattern that it again shared with the Fleetwood Sixty Special. A total of 143 options including bucket seats with wool, leather or nylon upholstery fabrics and wood veneer facings on dash, doors and seatbacks, set an all-time record for interior appointment choices. Standard equipment was the same as the previous year. The engine was entirely changed, though the displacement and output remained the same, and .

===1964===
The Eldorado received a minor facelift for 1964. The main visual cue indicating an Eldorado Biarritz rather than a De Ville convertible was simply the lack of fender skirts. New up front was a bi-angular grille that formed a V-shape along both its vertical and horizontal planes bisected by a central body-colored horizontal bar. Outer grille extension panels again housed the parking and cornering lamps. It was the 17th consecutive year for the Cadillac tailfins with a new fine-blade design carrying on the tradition. Performance improvements including a larger 429 cubic inch V8 engine were the dominant changes for the model run. Equipment features were same as in 1963 for the most part. Comfort Control, a completely automatic heating and air conditioning system controlled by a dial thermostat on the instrument panel, was introduced as an industry first. The engine was bumped to , with available. Performance gains from the new engine showed best in the lower range, at traffic driving speeds. A new technical feature was the Turbo-Hydramatic transmission, also used in the De Ville and the Sixty Special. Series 62, 75. and the Commercial Chassis continued with the old Hydra-Matic until 1965.

==Seventh generation (1965–1966)==

For 1965, the Eldorado gained Cadillac&#x27;s Fleetwood designation, marketed as the Fleetwood Eldorado, in a similar fashion to the Fleetwood Series 75 and the Fleetwood Sixty Special. The Biarritz nomenclature was finally dropped from sales literature, probably because there was no need to distinguish the convertible from the long defunct Eldorado Seville and Brougham (The Biarritz nameplate would be revived in 1976 as a trim option for the Eldorado coupe). This was the last generation Eldorado to be equipped with rear wheel drive.

The redesigned Eldorado still rode on the same wheelbase. The elevated tailfins became slightly downward-sloping, and sharp, distinct body lines replaced the rounded look. Also new were a straight rear bumper and vertical lamp clusters. The headlight pairs switched from horizontal to vertical, thus permitting a wider grille. Curved frameless side windows appeared with a tempered glass backlight. New standard features included lamps for luggage and glove compartments and front and rear safety belts. Power was still supplied by the 340 horsepower V8. Perimeter frame construction allowed repositioning the engine six inches forward in the frame, thus lowering the transmission hump and increasing interior room.

In 1966, changes included a somewhat coarser mesh for the radiator grille insert, which was now divided by a thick, bright metal horizontal center bar housing rectangular parking lamps at the outer ends. Separate rectangular side marker lamps replaced the integral grille extension designs. There was generally less chrome on all Cadillac models this year. Cadillac &quot;firsts&quot; this season included variable ratio power steering and optional front seats with carbon cloth heating pads built into the cushions and seatbacks. Comfort and convenience innovations were headrests, reclining seats and an AM/FM stereo system. Automatic level control was available. Engineering improvements made to the perimeter frame increased ride and handling ease. Newly designed piston and oil rings and a new engine mounting system and patented quiet exhaust were used.

==Eighth generation (1967–1970)==
The Eldorado was radically redesigned for 1967 as a front-wheel drive hardtop coupe, becoming Cadillac&#x27;s entry in the era&#x27;s burgeoning personal luxury car market. Promoted as a &quot;personal&quot; Cadillac, it shared the E-body with the second-generation Buick Riviera and the first-generation Oldsmobile Toronado, which had been introduced the previous year.

To enhance its distinctiveness, Cadillac adapted the Toronado&#x27;s front-wheel drive &quot;unified powerplant package&quot;, mating a Cadillac 429 V8 to a Turbo-Hydramatic 425 automatic transmission. Front disc brakes were optional, and new standard safety equipment included an energy absorbing steering column and generously padded instrument panel.

The 1967 Eldorado was a great departure from previous generations, which shared styling with Cadillac&#x27;s De Ville and Series 62. GM styling chief Bill Mitchell chose angular, crisp styling for the Eldorado, setting it apart from more streamlined Riviera and Toronado. The rear end design was inspired by the GM-X Stiletto concept car. It was the first and only Cadillac model with the headlamps concealed behind moveable covers; this feature was for two years only (1967 and 1968). Rear passenger windows retracted sideways into the C-pillar instead of down into the side body panel.

The Eldorado achieved 0-60 mph (0–97 km/h) acceleration in less than nine seconds, and a top speed of . Roadability and neutral handling were highly praised by contemporary reviews, and sales were excellent despite high list prices. Its sales of 17,930 units, nearly three times the previous Eldorado high, helped give Cadillac its best year ever.

In 1968, the 429 V8 was replaced by the new 472 (7.7 L) V8 with SAE gross and of torque. Despite the larger and more powerful engine, acceleration did not improve due to the reduction in final drive ratio from 3.21 to 3.07. Fuel consumption was 10 mpg (23.5 l/100 km) city and 13 mpg (18 l/100 km) highway. The hood was extended 4.5 inches longer in the rear as to conceal the windshield wipers. The previously optional front disc brakes became standard. The bumper-mounted front turn signal indicators and parking lights were repositioned to the fenders, replacing the end caps. The red side running lamps without retroreflective markers were attached to the rear fenders. The external rear view mirrors were enlarged and became rectangle-shaped with fixed housing and moveable mirror. Sales set another record at 24,528, with Eldorado accounting for nearly 11% of all Cadillac models sold.

In 1969, the concealed headlamps were eliminated due to the new federal safety regulations stipulating that the headlamp covers must operate within a specific period of time when entering tunnels or darkened buildings (i.e. parking garages). Side impact protection beams were installed inside the doors. The dashboard and instrument cluster were redesigned: the dash cowl became more pronounced and contained all of the controls, driver&#x27;s side vents, and instrument clusters. On the passenger side, the vents were moved to the single horizontal rosewood veneer panel. The instrument clusters had a thin wood veneer panel where the warning lights are located. For 1970, the wood veneer was expanded to cover most of the instrument clusters.

In 1970, the Eldorado featured the new Cadillac 500 V8 (8.2 L) V8 engine, putting out SAE gross and . It was exclusive to the Eldorado until 1975, when it became the standard engine option for all Cadillac models except the Seville. The power sunroof by ASC and rear &quot;Trackmaster&quot; anti-lock braking system were offered as extra-cost options. Styling changes for 1970 included a new grille with scripted &quot;Eldorado&quot; and rectangular &quot;8.2 LITRE&quot; badges, and new taillamp bezels that eliminated the protruding &quot;chrome fins&quot;. The side running lamps included retroreflective markers, amber in the front and red in the rear. 

==Ninth generation (1971–1978)==
The 1971 Eldorado was substantially redesigned, growing two inches in length, six in wheelbase and featuring standard fender skirts, all of which gave the car a much heavier appearance than the previous generation. The 500 cu in (8.2 L) V8 engine remained an Eldorado exclusive.

A convertible Eldorado was also offered for 1971, the first in the line since 1966. Door glass remained frameless, and the hardtop rear quarter windows were deleted, replaced by a fixed &quot;opera window&quot; in the widened &quot;C&quot; pillar. A stand-up wreath and crest hood ornament was new this year.

Inside, there was a new curved instrument panel and redesigned seats. A fiber-optic &quot;lamp monitor&quot; system, which displayed the functionality of the headlamps, taillamps, parking lamps, turn signals and brakelights was mounted on each front fender and the shelf below the rear window. This wheelbase version Eldorado would run through 1978, receiving major facelifts in 1973, 1974 and 1975. Sales in 1971 set a new record at 27,368.

Changes were minimal for 1972, the most noticeable exterior change was a new &#x27;Eldorado&#x27; script, replacing the block &#x27;Eldorado&#x27; lettering on the front fenders and trunk lid. Sales for 1972 increased to 40,074.

In 1973, the Eldorado was removed from the Fleetwood series and reestablished as its own series. The 1973 models received a major facelift, featuring a massive eggcrate grille, new front and rear bumpers, decklid, rear fenders and taillamps. Interiors featured new &quot;soft pillow&quot; door panels, with larger, sturdier pull-straps. The rear &quot;lamp monitor&quot; display which showed the driver the function of the turn signal, brake and taillamps, was relocated (except on the convertible) from the rear shelf, to the headliner just above the rear window.

The Cadillac Eldorado was chosen as the official pace car for the Indianapolis 500 in 1973. Cadillac produced 566 of these special pace car convertibles. Thirty-three were used at the track during the race week, with the remainder distributed to U.S. Cadillac dealers one per dealership. Sales of the Eldorado coupe and convertible soared to 51,451 the highest total for the model during the 1970s and over a sixth of all Cadillac sales for 1973.

The lengthened wheelbase reduced performance relative to contemporary premium personal luxury cars, but offered comfortable seating for six adults rather than just four.

1974 Eldorados featured a redesigned rear bumper with vertical chrome fender extensions, housing rear reflector/sidemarker lamps. This new bumper was designed to meet the new 5 mile impact federal design regulation. Other styling changes included new horizontal taillamps placed beneath the trunk lid, a new fine mesh grille with Cadillac script on the header and new standard wheel covers. Inside, there was a redesigned two-tier curved instrument panel, marketed in sales literature as &quot;space age&quot; and shared with all 1974 Cadillacs.
A new, quartz controlled digital clock, an &quot;information band&quot; of warning lights and the fuel gauge ran horizontally along the upper tier of this new instrument panel.

For 1975, the Eldorado received new rectangular headlamps, egg-crate grille, front bumper, full rear wheel openings sans fender skirts and sharper, angular lines resulting in a sleeker appearance reminiscent of the 1967–70 models.

1976 was to be the final year for the Eldorado convertible and the car was heavily promoted by General Motors as &quot;the last American convertible&quot;. Some 14,000 would be sold, many purchased as investments. The final 200 convertibles were designated as &quot;Bicentennial Edition&quot; commemorating America&#x27;s 200th birthday. All 200 of these cars were identical, painted white with a dual red/blue pinstripe along the upper bodyside and inside, a commemorative plaque was mounted on the dashboard. When Cadillac reintroduced the Eldorado convertible for the 1984 model year, several customers who had purchased 1976 Eldorado convertibles as investments, felt they had been deceived and launched an unsuccessful class action lawsuit against General Motors.
Having received a major facelift the previous year, the Eldorado for 1976 received only minor styling changes, including a new grille, a small Cadillac script on the hood face, revised taillamp lenses and new black painted wheel covers.

For 1977, the Eldorado again received a new grille with a finer crosshatch pattern. New vertical taillamps were relocated from below the trunk lid to the chrome bumper-fender extensions. New &#x27;Eldorado&#x27; block-lettering appeared on the hood face and new rectangular side marker lights with &#x27;Eldorado&#x27; block-lettering replaced the &#x27;Eldorado&#x27; script on the rear fenders. The convertible was dropped (although Custom Coach of Lima, Ohio converted a few 1977 and 1978 Eldorados into convertibles using salvaged parts from earlier models). The mammoth 500 cu in. (8.2L) V8 of 1970–76 was replaced by a new 425 cu in. (7L) V8 with available in all 1977 Cadillacs, except the Seville.

A new grille was the only obvious change for 1978; the Eldorado would be completely redesigned and downsized for 1979.

===Eldorado Biarritz===
Unlike the Fleetwood Brougham and De Ville, which both boasted the opulent &quot;d&#x27;Elegance&quot; trim luxury package, Cadillac did not offer a similar option for the Eldorado until late in the 1976 model year with the introduction of the &quot;Biarritz&quot; (a name last used for the 1964 Eldorado convertible) package. The car featured unique exterior trim and the rear half of the cabriolet roof was covered with a heavily padded landau vinyl top accented with large &quot;opera&quot; lights. Wheel covers with centers matching the car&#x27;s paint color were also featured. The 1977–1978 interior featured &quot;pillowed&quot;-style, &quot;tufted&quot; leather seating, while the 1976 interior did not. As with other Cadillac models, special order contrasting upholstery piping and exterior colors were available.

The 1978 &quot;Biarritz&quot; option packages consisted of the Eldorado Custom &quot;Biarritz&quot; ($1,865); with Astroroof ($2,946); with sunroof ($2,746) and Eldorado Custom &quot;Biarritz&quot; Classic ($2,466); with unique two-tone 
paint and Astroroof ($3,547); with sunroof ($3,347).

2000 Eldorado Custom &quot;Biarritz&quot; Classics were produced for 1978 only, in two-tone Arizona beige/demitasse brown consisting of 1,499 with no Astroroofs or no sunroofs; 475 with Astroroofs; 25 with sunroofs and one was produced with a power sliding T-top. Only nine of the latter are known to have been retrofitted by the American Sunroof Company under the direction of the Cadillac Motor Car Division.

The &quot;Biarritz&quot; package proved to be popular and was available on the Eldorado through the 1991 model year. In 1992, it was replaced with the touring coupe (ETC) option. Some of the original &quot;Biarritz&quot; styling cues vanished during the 1980s, such as the brushed stainless steel roof cap (1979–85) and the ultra-plush &quot;pillowed&quot; interior seating designs, but the &quot;Biarritz&quot; remained unique.

==Tenth generation (1979–1985)==
The tenth generation Eldorado debuted in 1979, continuing to share the same platform with the Buick Riviera and Oldsmobile Toronado. This model was successful in terms of annual production totals compared with the ninth and eleventh generations. The model set an all-time Eldorado sales record in 1984 of 77,806 (coupes and convertibles), accounting for about 26% of all Cadillacs sold.

===Design===
Independent rear suspension was adopted for the first time, helping retain rear-seat and trunk room in the smaller body. The most notable styling touch was an extreme notchback roofline. The Eldorado &quot;Biarritz&quot; model featured a stainless-steel roof cap (similar to the 1957–1958 Eldorado Brougham), wider chrome trim along the top of the doors and rear quarter glass, and additional fender spear moldings. The Eldorado featured frameless door glass, and rear quarter windows, similar to those from 1967 to 1970, without a thick &quot;B&quot; pillar. The Eldorado and the redesigned 1980 Cadillac Seville shared front wheel drive platforms. The cars were not true hardtops, as the rear quarter windows were fixed.

The Cadillac Trip Computer was available on the 1979 Eldorado. First offered on the 1978 Cadillac Seville, it replaced the conventional analog speedometer and fuel gauge with digital readouts. A 12-button panel mounted above the climate control allowed for selection of operating data to be displayed on a third display located where the Coolant Temp light would be on the analog cluster. Just as with the Seville, this option was not available with the diesel engine as it required interfacing to the gasoline 350 engine&#x27;s analog ECU. 1980 saw a major electrical architecture change to support the new DEFI 368 drivetrain which was GM&#x27;s first implementation of Digital Fuel Injection. This included a new electronic climate control interface as well as an MPG Sentinel display which made the Trip Computer mostly superfluous. A digital speedometer cluster was not yet available with this new system, but would return for 1981, along with a significant number of hardware improvements. Unlike the Trip Computer speedometer, this version used vacuum fluorescent displays and allowed for selection of either English or Metric units. This option was offered on both Eldorado and Seville through 1985.

===Engines===
The tenth generation Eldorado was available with multiple engine variants; four gasoline and one diesel option. In 1981, Cadillac offered a V6 for the first time in its history, a 4.1 liter engine sourced from Buick.

====350====
For 1979, the analog-injected Oldsmobile 350 ci (5.7 L) gasoline V8 was carried over from the Seville model. California-emission models differed in that they had a modified ECU, special catalyst system, and an O2 sensor for closed-loop operation. This would also be the standard CA-spec engine for 1980.

====368====
In 1980, the standard engine was a Cadillac 368 ci (6.0L) gasoline V8. This was a reduced bore, reduced stroke version of the Cadillac 425/472/500 family. This was GM&#x27;s first implementation of digital fuel injection and required an extensive redesign of the vehicle&#x27;s electrical architecture, which was shared with the newly designed Seville. Unlike the previous multi-port arrangement on the 350, this system used throttle body injection.

====4.1 L====
For 1982, Cadillac unveiled the 4.1 L &quot;High Technology&quot; HT-4100 engine. The performance was modest relative to older generations of the Eldorado. It possessed , powering the car to a top speed of and a 0-60 time of 13.8 sec, with fuel economy of 

This lightweight engine, used in all full-size 1982 Cadillacs (except limousines) was a wet-sleeve design that mated cast-iron heads to an aluminum block. Many HT-4100s were replaced under warranty due to aluminum oil pump failure, cam bearing displacement, intake gasket failure (scrubbing of the bi-metal interface), weak aluminum block castings and bolts pulling the aluminum threads from the block. 

====350 diesel====
The Oldsmobile 350 ci diesel engine was available as an option all years, but due to its unreliable reputation and the inversion of gasoline to diesel pricing during the early 1980&#x27;s, its popularity waned. Initially rated 126 PS (93 kW; 125 hp), design changes and reduction in compression ratio reduced its output to . A diesel-equipped 1982 model with this engine had a top speed of and a 0-60 time of 17.3 sec, with fuel economy of 25 mpg.

====V8-6-4 L62====
For 1981 only, the Eldorado was fitted with a V8-6-4 variable displacement variant of the 368 engine. 4 solenoids fitted to the cylinder heads allowed deactivation of two or four cylinders under light load conditions, and only when in high gear. The system was dropped due to customer complaints regarding vibration, and failure to gain agreement with the NHTSA on appropriate government fuel economy (CAFE) ratings, defeating the initial intent of the system. On CAFE-exempt vehicles, such as the commercial chassis, the V864 system continued to be used through 1985.

The 368 engine itself was very durable, its only modification being solenoids attached to the heads, but the electronics, software and valve switch gear were the source of continued customer complaints. Since modulated displacement mode only operated when the transmission was in high gear, disabling the system was as simple as unplugging a single connector, leaving the engine to operate on all eight cylinders.

====V6 LC4====
In pursuit of additional CAFE credits, the Buick LC4 V6 engine was available for 1981 and 1982. It came with a 4-barrel carburetor, had an 8.0:1 compression ratio, and produces at 4,000 rpm and at 2,000 RPM. As was the case with diesel-equipped Eldorado models, the MPG Sentinel was not available, though a modified digital speedometer cluster was offered, which removed the Fuel Range display.

===Trim options===

From 1982 through 1985, Cadillac offered the Eldorado &quot;Touring Coupe&quot;, with heavier duty &quot;touring&quot; suspension, close-ratio steering, aluminum alloy wheels, larger blackwall white-letter tires, cloisonné hood ornament, body-colored headlamp and taillamp bezels, wide-ribbed rocker moldings and available in limited color options.

These Eldorados were marketed as &quot;drivers&#x27; cars&quot; and included reclining front bucket seats with lumbar support, leather-wrapped steering wheel and a center console. The diesel engine was not available with this package.

Late in the 1985 model year, an optional &quot;Commemorative Edition&quot; package was announced, in honor of the last year of production for this version of the Eldorado. Exclusive features included gold-tone script and tail-lamp emblems, specific sail panel badges, gold-background wheel center caps, and a &quot;Commemorative Edition&quot; badge on the steering wheel horn pad. Leather upholstery (available in dark blue or white, or a two-tone with dark blue and white) was included in the offering, along with a dark blue dashboard and carpeting. Exterior colors were cotillion white or commodore blue.

=== Return of the Eldorado Convertible ===
In 1984, eight years after Cadillac built its last convertible, the division temporarily resumed production of a convertible version of the Eldorado Biarritz. This car was an official Cadillac production option convertible converted by American Sunroof Corporation (ASC, Inc.) offered only for the 1984–85 model years coded by vehicle VIN. The car was 200 pounds (91 kg) heavier, featuring the same interior as the Eldorado Biarritz coupe. The 1985 model year was also the last for the aftermarket non-factory option conversions by ASC, Inc.

Prior to the official 1984 and 1985 Eldorado convertibles marketed by Cadillac, some 1979–1983 Eldorados were made into coach convertibles by independent coachbuilders e.g. ASC inc., Custom Coach (Lima, Ohio—this coachbuilder turned a few 1977 and 1978 Eldorados into convertibles) and Hess &amp; Eisenhardt. The same coach-builders also offered Buick Riviera and Oldsmobile Toronado convertibles.

===Production totals===

==Eleventh generation (1986–1991)==

As a key factor influencing the design of the 11th generation Eldorado, GM relied on a consultant&#x27;s prediction that gasoline would rise sharply by 1986. Concluded smaller luxury cars would be in demand, General Motors downsized its full-sized cars for the second time for model year 1985. Higher fuel prices did not materialize.

By then, Cadillac had downsized the 11th generation Eldorado substantially—by in length and in weight—as with its badge engineered variants, the Oldsmobile Toronado, Buick Riviera, and Cadillac Seville.

Buick and Oldsmobile&#x27;s variants carried Buick&#x27;s 3.8 liter V6 engine, while the Eldorado continued with the 4.1 liter V8. A single fiberglass transverse leaf spring was used for its fully independent rear suspension. Four wheel disc brakes were standard, as was electronic leveling control. The completely redesigned instrument panel featured a full digital display. The shift lever was moved from the steering column to the center console. New redesigned bucket seats had lumbar support. The Biarritz option featured an upgraded interior with genuine walnut trim on the instrument panel, center console and door panels.

1985&#x27;s convertible body style was dropped to make way for the forthcoming Cadillac Allanté roadster. For the first time, the Eldorado no longer featured a hardtop body style, instead using framed door glass. Despite its much smaller exterior size, the Eldorado&#x27;s interior volume remained comparable to the previous generation.

The 11th generation carrying a base price of $24,251 (~$ in ), nearly 16% higher than the 1985 model, annual sales of the Eldorado dropped 72% from the final year of the previous generation. One automotive observer noted the 11th generation Eldorado was too small for Cadillac&#x27;s traditional customers, yet unable to attract buyers from the targeted competitors, e.g., BMW and Mercedes-Benz.

===Model year changes===

====1987====
Aside from a longer, 5 year/50,000 mile warranty, the Eldorado was virtually unchanged for 1987, though with a price drop, to $23,740 ($ in dollars ). The standard suspension, with new taller 75 series (previously 70) tires and hydro-elastic engine mounts, was slightly retuned for a softer ride, while the optional ($155) &quot;touring suspension&quot; ($ in dollars ), with deflected-disc strut valves and 15-inch alloy wheels, remained for those desiring a firmer ride. As part of a federal requirement to discourage &quot;chop-shop&quot; thieves, major body panels were etched with the VIN. Also new, a combination cashmere cloth with leather upholstery, and locking inertia seat belt reels for rear seat passengers, which allowed for child-seat installation in the outboard seating positions in back. The formal cabriolet roof was added this year. Available for $495 on the base Eldorado, it featured a padded covering over the rear half of the roof, and turned the rear side glass into smaller opera windows. One of the Eldorado&#x27;s most expensive standalone options was the Motorola cellular telephone mounted inside the locking center arm rest. Priced at $2,850 ($ in dollars ), it had been reworked this year for easier operation, and featured a microphone mounted between the sun visors for hands-free operation. Additionally, the telephone featured a radio mute control: activated when the telephone and radio were in use simultaneously, it automatically decreased the rear speaker&#x27;s audio volume, and over-rode the front music speakers to be used for the hands-free telephone.

====1988 facelift====
The 1988 Eldorado received a facelift and sales nearly doubled from the previous year, up to 33,210. Essentially, the revision lengthened the rear fender end-caps, making the Eldorado longer than in 1987; the wheelbase, doors, roof, and glass remained relatively unchanged and body panels were revised. Standard equipment included Cadillac&#x27;s new 155 horsepower 4.5 liter V8. A comprehensive anti-lock braking system, developed by Teves, was newly available. Both front and rear fenders featured creased blade elements that rose slightly proud of the adjacent sheetmetal. Revisions included a new grille above the revamped front bumper, slightly protruding three-sided tail lamps and a revised rear bumper and trunk lid. Bladed 14-inch aluminum wheels remained standard, while an optional 15-inch snowflake-pattern alloy wheel was included with the touring suspension option.

The 1988 interior featured wider front seat headrests and swing-away door pull handles, replacing pull-straps. New upholstery patterns, along with shoulder belts for outboard rear-seat passengers, appeared for both base and Biarritz models, with the latter returning to the tufted-button design last seen in the 1985 Biarritz. A new vinyl roof option, covering the full rooftop, featured a band of body color above the side door and windows – similar to the style used until 1978. This replaced the &quot;cabriolet roof&quot; option, which covered the rear half of the roof, introduced just a year earlier. With the Biarritz option package, the padded vinyl roof covered just the rear quarter of the rooftop, behind the rear side windows. Biarritz also included slender vertical opera lamps, as in 1986 and 1987, but now added a spear molding (similar to the style used on the 1976–1985 Eldorado Biarritz) that ran from the base of the rooftop, continuing horizontally along the door, and down to the front fender tip. The standard power antenna was moved from the front passenger fender to the rear passenger fender. Nineteen shades of exterior paint were available (two more than the previous year). Prices increased this year – to $24,891 ($ in dollars ). This 1988 facelift would be the last until the Eldorado was completely redesigned for 1992.

====1989====
For 1989, the optional automatic rearview mirror transitioned from an electrically operated mechanical tilting mechanism to the new electrochromic style, using a clear fluid filled between the mirror and a thin sheet of glass, which tints on activation. A new exterior color, White Diamond, brought the color choices up to 18. Gone were the 14-inch wheels, as the previously optional 15-inch &quot;snowflake&quot;-style aluminum wheel, introduced the previous year, was made standard for the base Eldorado. A compact disc player, available only with the Delco Bose Gold Series music system, was a new option this year, as were reversible floor mats, and gold-plated ornamentation (&quot;Cadillac&quot; grille and trunk scripts, sail panel ornaments, deck lid engine plaque, trunk lock cover, tail lamp emblems, and available wire wheel cover wreath and crest). New standard items included an express-down module for the driver&#x27;s window, electronic oil-life indicator, a more powerful Delco Freedom II battery, a revised factory warranty, and GM&#x27;s PASS (Passive Automotive Security System) KEY theft-deterrent system, which activated the fuel system based upon a coded pellet within the ignition key. Previously optional items that were now added as standard equipment included a cassette player with graphic equalizer, remote fuel filler door release, and front license plate mounting. To deplete existing warehouse stock, the brushed chrome lower bodyside accent molding, optional through last year, was added as standard equipment for 1989 (revamped moldings would appear in 1990). New high-gloss Birdseye Maple trim (replacing the satin-finished American walnut used from 1986 to 1988) on the instrument panel and console was standard on Eldorado Biarritz, and a $245 option on the base Eldorado. The full cabriolet roof option, roughly simulating a convertible top, was offered in limited colors. Prices rose to $26,738 ($ in dollars ). Production slipped slightly to 27,807 (including 7,174 Biarritz models). Similarly, the restyled Buick Riviera grew 11 inches this year and had a production increase from 8,625 cars in 1988 to 21,189 in 1989.

====1990====
A driver-side airbag was introduced as standard equipment, deleting the telescoping steering column but retaining tilt capability. Where cruise controls had been previously mounted on the center of the steering wheel, the air bag required a smaller diameter steering wheel, and controls moved to the turn signal lever. A &quot;Touring Coupe&quot; trim level was introduced later in the model year. A new multi-point fuel injection replaced the throttle-body style from the MY88, and horsepower increased from 155 to 180, requiring premium fuel. The front suspension stabilizer shaft was revised; &quot;Snowflake&quot; alloy wheel were standard, with an optional cast aluminum wheel design, not available with the touring suspension package; and the tire jack received a dedicated carpeted storage compartment in the trunk.

Interior revisions for 1990 included new molded seat trim panels, front bucket seats featuring additional lateral and lumbar support, French seams, and revised front headrests. Full leather upholstery (formerly leather and cloth) became standard on the Biarritz trim level, and the base model lost their seat-back map pockets. The optional cellular telephone was no longer available, and the vinyl center armrest was revised. The electronic climate control received three automatic and two manual settings. The optional leather upholstery package for the base model now included a power passenger seat recliner. 1990 models incorporated the former &quot;Eldorado option package&quot; as standard equipment, including revised carpeted floor mats, body-color door edge guards, illuminated driver and passenger visor, trunk mat, and an illuminated entry system. Previously optional equipment became standard equipment, including the rear window defogger with heated outside mirrors and bodyside accent striping.

New options included a central-unlocking feature (from the outside door locks, using the key) added to the automatic door locks. For model year 1990, the rear deck lid carried a port fuel injection emblem, featured a chrome handle above the license plate opening and rear safety reflectors moved from the bumper onto the panel below the decklid. A charcoal-color vinyl strip accented the chrome bumper and bodyside moldings, while the front bumper guards changed from body-color to charcoal.

MSRP for 1990 base Eldorado was $28,885 ($ in dollars ) and for the Biarritz trim level an additional $3,180 ($ in dollars ). Production dropped to 22,291 cars, about 1/3 of which were the Biarritz package and 1,507 were the Eldorado touring coupe package.

====1991====
1991 was the final year for the eleventh-generation Eldorado. New this year was Cadillac&#x27;s 4.9 liter port fuel injection V-8 engine with GM&#x27;s 4T60-E electronically-controlled four-speed transmission. The Cadillac-exclusive &quot;viscous converter clutch&quot; provided smoother shifting under hard acceleration. Engine controls were monitored by the GMP4 powertrain control module (PCM), an on-board 64-kilobyte computer. A new exhaust set-up with a wider catalytic converter reduced restriction by 38% from 1990, while the 0-60 mph speed went from 9 seconds in 1990 to 8.2 for 1991. Revised engine mounts decreased cabin noise and vibration. Adaptive suspension, marketed as Computer Command Ride (CCR), automatically adapted the suspension mode to vehicle speed for improved handling and ride comfort; this system was standard on Eldorado and optional on most other Cadillac models. The Bosch II anti-lock braking system, previously a $925 option, was made standard, as well as a more powerful 140-amp alternator.

A $309 electrically-heated windshield was a new option, as was the &quot;security package&quot; ($480 on base Eldorado, no-charge on Biarritz or Touring Coupe) which now included remote keyless entry along with automatic door locks with central unlocking. A $480 theft-deterrent system was also optional on the base Eldorado and available for no-charge on the Biarritz or Touring Coupe. The windshield washer system was revised.

Base price for the 1991 Eldorado was $31,245 ($ in dollars ), a $2,400 increase from 1990. Several items became no-charge options on the base Eldorado, including a full vinyl roof covering or full-cabriolet (convertible-look) roof (an otherwise $1,095 option), leather upholstery with power passenger recliner, and the Delco-Bose sound system, available with CD or cassette. For 1991, the $2,050 (~$ in ) Touring Coupe and the $3,180 Biarritz trim packages included a power moon roof and Delco-Bose stereo system at no additional charge. 1991 marked the final year for the Eldorado Biarritz. Production dropped to 16,212 (including 2,249 touring coupe models), the lowest for any Eldorado model since 1966.

===Production totals===


==Twelfth generation (1992–2002)==
The twelfth and final generation Eldorado introduced for 1992 was longer and wider than the previous generation, featuring frameless window glass. Marketed in either ESC (Eldorado Sport Coupe) and ETC (Eldorado Touring Coupe) trim, the former featured a stand-up hood ornament, Cadillac crests on the rear roof pillar, 16-inch multi-spoke alloy wheels, and concealed exhausts.

Shortly after introduction Cadillac&#x27;s new Northstar V8 became available in both 270 and variants, replacing the previous generation&#x27;s 4.9 L L26.

Standard equipment included cloth upholstery, Zebrano wood trim, 6-way power front bucket seats, climate control, digital instrumentation, column-mounted gear selector, and three-position electronically adjustable &quot;Speed-Sensitive Suspension&quot;. The ETC featured a grille-mounted Cadillac wreath and crest, &quot;Touring Coupe&quot; scripts on the doors, integrated fog lamps, flat-face 16-inch alloy wheels, and quad exhaust outlets. Its standard equipment included gathered leather seating areas, marketed as &quot;Nuance&quot; leather; 12-way power seats; Zebrano-trimmed floor console with gear selector, analog instrumentation, and specially tuned suspension.
* 1993: The Touring Coupe received a two-spoke steering wheel, body-color grille, and 6-way seats, previously 12-way. An Eldorado Sport Coupe model was introduced, featuring the new Northstar V8 and quad-tipped exhaust, full-floor console with gear selector (without Zebrano trim), and touring-tuned adaptive suspension, now marketed as &quot;Road Sensing Suspension&quot;. A passenger airbag became standard equipment on all models, the previously matte-black exterior side mirrors from 1992 were now body-color, and revised 16-inch chromed alloy wheels became available.
* 1994: Eldorado and Eldorado Touring Coupe trims were offered. The steering wheel was revised to a four-spoke design. Both models now had quad exhausts. A new &quot;Sport Appearance Package&quot; option allowed the buyer to order most of the Touring Coupe&#x27;s cosmetic features on the base Eldorado.
* 1995: The Eldorado featured revised front and rear bumpers, side cladding, chrome eggcrate grille, and seven-spoke alloy wheels.
* 1996: The interior received a larger analog gauge cluster, relocated climate control system, and updated stereo faces. While the four-spoke steering wheel was a carry-over, new steering wheel-mounted duplicate climate and audio controls. The Touring Coupe offered perforated in leau of the gathered leather on other models. The Touring Coupe also received rain-sensing wipers marketed as &quot;Rainsense&quot;, and once again a body-color radiator grille. Daytime running lights were standard.
* 1997: Microprocessor integration of engine, traction control, Stabilitrak electronic stability control, steering, and adaptive continuously variable road sensing suspension (CVRSS) became standard, marketed as Integrated Chassis Control System — similar to the Toyota/Lexus Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management (VDIM).
* 2000: With the Buick Riviera and Oldsmobile Toronado rebadged variants discontinued and the Seville and Deville sedan no longer sharing platforms, the Eldorado became GM&#x27;s last production K- or E-body vehicle, and assembly was moved to the Lansing Craft Center.
* 2002: As Eldorado&#x27;s 50th model year, GM announced 2002 would be its last. To mark the end of the nameplate, a limited run of 1,596 cars in red or white—the colors available on the original 1953 convertible—were produced in three batches of 532, signifying the Eldorado&#x27;s first year of production. These last cars featured specially-tuned exhaust notes imitating the models, and a dash-mounted plaque indicating each car&#x27;s sequence in production. Production ended on April 22, 2002, and the last Eldorado produced was donated to the Cadillac Museum in honor of Cadillac dealer Don Massey. The Lansing Craft Center retooled to manufacture the Chevrolet SSR.

<doc id="417853" wikidata="Q8014747" url="?curid=417853" title="William Lowther, 2nd Earl of Lonsdale">
<text>William Lowther, 2nd Earl of Lonsdale, PC, FRS (21 July 1787 – 4 March 1872), styled Viscount Lowther between 1807 and 1844, was a British Tory politician.

==Background==
Lonsdale was the eldest son of William Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale, and Lady Augusta, daughter of John Fane, 9th Earl of Westmorland. Henry Lowther was his younger brother. He was educated at Harrow and Trinity College, Cambridge.

==Political career==

Lonsdale was returned to parliament for Cockermouth in 1808, a seat he held until 1813, and later represented Westmorland between 1813 and 1831 and 1832 and 1841, Dunwich in 1832 and West Cumberland between 1832 and 1833. He was sworn of the Privy Council in 1818 and served under the Duke of Wellington as First Commissioner of Woods and Forests between 1828 and 1830 and under Sir Robert Peel as Treasurer of the Navy and Vice-President of the Board of Trade between 1834 and 1835.

In 1841 he was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Baron Lowther and held office under Peel as Postmaster General between 1841 and 1845. In 1844 he succeeded his father in the earldom of Lonsdale. He held his last ministerial office as Lord President of the Council, with a seat in the cabinet, in 1852, in the Earl of Derby&#x27;s first administration.
Lonsdale was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 5 July 1810. He was also Lord Lieutenant of Cumberland and Westmorland between 1844 and 1868.

==Personal life==
Lord Lonsdale never married, but acknowledged three illegitimate children born to opera singers or dancers; he left them substantial sums in his will. His daughter with Caroline Saintfal, Marie Caroline, was born in Paris in 1818. Another daughter born the same year, Frances (&quot;Fanny&quot;) Lowther (1818–1890), was registered as the daughter of &quot;Narcisse Chassepomp&quot;, in fact Pierre-Narcisse Chaspoux, formerly a dancer at the Paris Opera and then in London, who in 1821 gave birth to the artist Charles Meryon. Frances (Fanny) married Henry Broadwood MP (1793–1878, of the piano-making family), and was the mother of Brig-Gen. Arthur Broadwood (1848–1928). With Emilia Cresotti, an Italian opera singer, he fathered Francis William Lowther (1841–1908), who was the father of Claude Lowther MP and Toupie Lowther.

He died in his London house at 15 Carlton House Terrace on 4 March 1872, aged 84, and was succeeded in the earldom and to Lowther Castle by his nephew, Henry. On the day he died he waited in his carriage outside a London auction house, while an agent bid on his behalf on some lots of porcelain. Of an estate valued at £700,000 (without the entailed land), Francis William and Fanny were bequeathed £125,000 each, and Francis&#x27;s son £25,000.

A marble bust of him was sculpted by Edward Bowring Stephens, now in the National Trust collection at Hughenden Manor, Buckinghamshire.

==Collecting==
From 1842 until his death he gathered a remarkable collection of ancient works of art at his enormous country seat, Lowther Castle, composed of more than 100 pieces of Egyptian, Etruscan, Greek, and mostly Roman sculpture, whose selection reflected the spirit of the collections of the ‘Golden Age of Dilettantism’ during the Victorian era.

<doc id="417854" wikidata="Q1769980" url="?curid=417854" title="Marsh Gibbon">
<text>Marsh Gibbon is a village and civil parish in Buckinghamshire, England. It is close to the A41 and the border with Oxfordshire about east of Bicester.

In the centre of the village the buildings are largely built of local stone, and roofed in tiles, slate and thatch. Many of which are listed buildings. The centre and east of the village are designated as the Marsh Gibbon Conservation Area, including the Greyhound pub, The Plough, the Manor House and the Church.

In the south of the parish, formerly part of the ancient Bernwood Forest, the landscape and habitat has been designated as the Upper Ray Meadows Nature Reserve, while Long Herdon Meadow is a national Site of Special Scientific Interest.

==History==
The village name comes from the English word &#x27;Marsh&#x27;, describing the typical state of land in the area due to the high water table of the Aylesbury Vale district. The affix &#x27;Gibbon&#x27; derives from the family name &#x27;Gibwen&#x27;, the Lords of the manor in the twelfth century. In manorial rolls of 1292 the village was recorded as &quot;Mersh Gibwyne&quot;, though earlier (in 1086) it was known simply as &quot;Merse&quot;.

One of the two entries in the Domesday Book for the village is unique in having the only comment of any kind, namely &quot;Graviter et miserabiliter&quot;. In translation the complete entry reads:

Ailric&#x27;s manor, now named Westbury Manor, was given by King Edward IV to the Company of Cooks in London, though it was sold in 1883 to Thomas H. Phipps, whose family still owns the manor.

The larger manor was the property of the abbey of Grestein in Normandy, France. In 1348 the lands of the Abbey of Grestein, including Marsh Gibbon and the manors of Ramridge in Hampshire and Conock in Wiltshire, were seized by Edward the Black Prince during the Hundred Year’s War, as ransom for the capture of Jean de Melun, Comte de Tancarville during the Crecy campaign. He in turn assigned these and other manors in payment of debt to Tideman de Lymbergh of the Hanseatic League, who in 1350 by licence of the king demised them to Michael and Thomas de la Pole, sons of William de la Pole

In 1442 Michael de la Pole’s descendant William Duke of Suffolk granted these three manors to the almshouse trust founded by himself and his wife Alice Chaucer at Ewelme in Oxfordshire. The Ewelme Almshouse Trust has held these lands ever since.

In 1617 James I granted the Mastership of the Ewelme Trust to the Regius Professor of Medicine at the University of Oxford in whose hands it remains today. Its manor house is Elizabethan and situated just south of the thirteenth-century church and about 200 metres from Westbury Manor to the West.

Following a skirmish at Hillesden in 1645, the parliamentarian troops were garrisoned in Marsh Gibbon before marching on to Boarstall. The ground works of their encampment were visible in the field to northwest of the Ewelme manor house but have since been flattened in the late 1950s.

In 1858 Sir Henry Acland was appointed to the post of Regius Professor of Medicine and Master of the Trust, a post he retained until 1894. He was appointed to the Royal Sanitary Commission on public health in 1869, and took a great interest in the welfare and sanitation of rural villages like Marsh Gibbon. In order to improve the distressed condition of village housing, he had 28 new stone houses built for residents in the period 1860-1880 – each had half an acre of land, an earth closet and a pigsty. Along with the houses, a dispensary was introduced and a Reading Room started. At the time all water in the village was supplied by wooden pipes from the Stump Well, which can still be seen in the field behind the manor. In 1884, Acland published &quot;Health in the Village&quot; (1864), an influential book based on his experience in Marsh Gibbon and presenting “a broad view of the circumstances most favourable to the good order and happiness of a rural population” – it includes a map of the village and a plan of the houses that were built, describing them as model labourer’s cottages.

==Geography==
The landscape is predominantly pastoral, with significant areas of archaeological and biological interest. The geology of the area comprises cornbrash limestone to the west, and Kellaway beds and Oxford Clay to the east and south of the parish. To the east of the village is the hamlet of Little Marsh and to the south east is the hamlet of Summerstown.

==Amenities==
The parish church of Marsh Gibbon is dedicated to St Mary the Virgin. Robert Clavering, who later became the Bishop of Peterborough, was the rector from 1719.
The village has two pubs, the Greyhound and the Plough.

North of the village and just outside Poundon, is Tower Hill Business Park. This was previously Poundon Hill Wireless Station, a FCO/MI6 signals intelligence station.
Marsh Gibbon Church of England School is a mixed, voluntary aided primary school, with approximately 100 pupils. It takes children from the age of four through to the age of eleven.

<text>Westbury is a village and civil parish in northern Buckinghamshire, England, about east of Brackley and west of Buckingham. It is close to the A422 and the border with Oxfordshire.

The village was given by King Edward IV to the Company of Cooks in London, and has since been sold into private hands.

The parish church is St Augustine, a Grade II* listed building. The church dates back to the 13th century, though much restored in 1863. The church tower house four bells, one of which dates back to the 14th century.

The village is home to Beachborough School, a private prep school established originally in Hampshire in 1910, but relocated to Westbury in 1942 in the manor house.

The village has a website providing information regarding the services and events taking place in the village. www.westburyvillage.org

<doc id="417858" wikidata="Q298237" url="?curid=417858" title="Benedict Arnold">
<text>Benedict Arnold (June 14, 1801) was an American-born British military officer who served during the American Revolutionary War. He fought with distinction for the American Continental Army and rose to the rank of major general before defecting to the British in 1780. General George Washington had given him his fullest trust and had placed him in command of West Point in New York. Arnold was planning to surrender the fort to British forces, but the plot was discovered in September 1780, whereupon he fled to the British lines. In the later part of the war, Arnold was commissioned as a brigadier general in the British Army and placed in command of the American Legion. He led British forces in battle against the army which he had once commanded, and his name became synonymous with treason and betrayal in the United States.

Arnold was born in Connecticut. He was a merchant operating ships in the Atlantic when the war began. He joined the growing American army outside of Boston and distinguished himself by acts that demonstrated intelligence and bravery: In 1775, he captured Fort Ticonderoga. In 1776, he employed defensive and delay tactics at the Battle of Valcour Island in Lake Champlain that gave American forces time to prepare New York&#x27;s defenses. His performance in the Battle of Ridgefield in Connecticut prompted his promotion to major general. He conducted operations that provided the Americans with relief during the Siege of Fort Stanwix, and key actions during the pivotal 1777 Battles of Saratoga in which he sustained leg injuries that put him out of combat for several years.

Arnold repeatedly claimed that he was being passed over for promotion by the Second Continental Congress, and that other officers were being given credit for some of his accomplishments. Some in his military and political circles charged him with corruption. After formal inquiries he was acquitted of all but two minor charges, but Congress investigated his finances and determined that he was indebted to Congress and that he had borrowed money heavily to maintain a lavish lifestyle.

Arnold mingled with Loyalist sympathizers in Philadelphia and married into the Loyalist family of Peggy Shippen. She was a close friend of British Major John André and kept in contact with him when he became head of the British espionage system in New York. Many historians see her as having facilitated Arnold&#x27;s plans to switch sides; he opened secret negotiations with André, and she relayed their messages to each other. The British promised £20,000 () for the capture of West Point, a major American stronghold. Washington greatly admired Arnold and gave him command of that fort in July 1780. His plan was to surrender the fort to the British, but it was exposed in September 1780 when American militiamen captured André carrying papers which revealed the plot. Arnold escaped and André was hanged.

Arnold received a commission as a brigadier general in the British Army, an annual pension of £360 (), and a lump sum of over £6,000 (). He led British forces in the raid on Richmond and oversaw a raid on New London, Connecticut which burned much of it to the ground. Arnold also commanded British forces at the Battle of Blandford and the Battle of Groton Heights, the latter taking place just a few miles downriver from the town where he had grown up. In the winter of 1782, he and Peggy moved to London. He was well received by King George III and the Tories but frowned upon by the Whigs and most British Army officers. In 1787, he moved to Canada to run a merchant business with his sons Richard and Henry. He was extremely unpopular there and returned to London permanently in 1791, where he died ten years later.

==Early life==
Benedict Arnold was born a British subject, the second of six children of his father Benedict Arnold III (1683–1761) and Hannah Waterman King in Norwich, Connecticut Colony, on January 14, 1741. Arnold was the fourth member of his family named after his great-grandfather Benedict Arnold I, an early governor of the Colony of Rhode Island; his grandfather (Benedict Arnold II) and father, as well as an older brother who died in infancy, were also named for the colonial governor. Only he and his sister Hannah survived to adulthood; his other siblings died from yellow fever in childhood. His siblings were, in order of birth: Benedict (1738–1739), Hannah (1742–1803), Mary (1745–1753), Absolom (1747–1750), and Elizabeth (1749–1755). Through his maternal grandmother, Arnold was a descendant of John Lothropp, an ancestor of six presidents.

Arnold&#x27;s father was a successful businessman, and the family moved in the upper levels of Norwich society. He was enrolled in a private school in nearby Canterbury, Connecticut, when he was 10, with the expectation that he would eventually attend Yale College. However, the deaths of his siblings two years later may have contributed to a decline in the family fortunes, since his father took up drinking. By the time that he was 14, there was no money for private education. His father&#x27;s alcoholism and ill health kept him from training Arnold in the family mercantile business, but his mother&#x27;s family connections secured an apprenticeship for him with her cousins Daniel and Joshua Lathrop, who operated a successful apothecary and general merchandise trade in Norwich. His apprenticeship with the Lathrops lasted seven years.

Arnold was very close to his mother, who died in 1759. His father&#x27;s alcoholism worsened after her death, and the youth took on the responsibility of supporting his father and younger sister. His father was arrested on several occasions for public drunkenness, was refused communion by his church, and died in 1761.

==French and Indian War==
In 1755, Arnold was attracted by the sound of a drummer and attempted to enlist in the provincial militia for service in the French and Indian War, but his mother refused permission. In 1757 when he was 16, he did enlist in the Connecticut militia, which marched off toward Albany, New York, and Lake George. The French had besieged Fort William Henry in northeastern New York, and their Indian allies had committed atrocities after their victory. Word of the siege&#x27;s disastrous outcome led the company to turn around, and Arnold served for only 13 days. A commonly accepted story that he deserted from militia service in 1758 is based on uncertain documentary evidence.

==Colonial merchant==
Arnold established himself in business in 1762 as a pharmacist and bookseller in New Haven, Connecticut, with the help of the Lathrops. He was hardworking and successful, and was able to rapidly expand his business. In 1763, he repaid money that he had borrowed from the Lathrops, repurchased the family homestead that his father had sold when deeply in debt, and re-sold it a year later for a substantial profit. In 1764, he formed a partnership with Adam Babcock, another young New Haven merchant. They bought three trading ships, using the profits from the sale of his homestead, and established a lucrative West Indies trade.

During this time, Arnold brought his sister Hannah to New Haven and established her in his apothecary to manage the business in his absence. He traveled extensively in the course of his business throughout New England and from Quebec to the West Indies, often in command of one of his own ships. Some sources allege that on one of his voyages he fought a duel in Honduras with a British sea captain who had called him a &quot;damned Yankee, destitute of good manners or those of a gentleman&quot;. The captain was wounded in the first exchange of gunfire, and he apologized when Arnold threatened to aim to kill on the second. However, it is unknown whether this encounter actually happened or not, and some historians characterize the alleged duel as a fabrication.

The Sugar Act 1764 and the Stamp Act 1765 severely curtailed mercantile trade in the colonies. The Stamp Act prompted Arnold to join the chorus of voices in opposition, and also led to his joining the Sons of Liberty, a secret organization which advocated resistance to those and other restrictive Parliamentary measures. Arnold initially took no part in any public demonstrations but, like many merchants, continued to do business openly in defiance of the parliamentary acts, which legally amounted to smuggling. He also faced financial ruin, falling £16,000 () in debt with creditors spreading rumors of his insolvency, to the point where he took legal action against them. On the night of January 28, 1767, he and members of his crew roughed up a man suspected of attempting to inform authorities of Arnold&#x27;s smuggling. He was convicted of disorderly conduct and fined the relatively small amount of 50 shillings; publicity of the case and widespread sympathy for his views probably contributed to the light sentence.

On February 22, 1767, Arnold married Margaret Mansfield, daughter of Samuel Mansfield, the sheriff of New Haven and a fellow member in the local Masonic lodge. Their son Benedict was born the following year and was followed by brothers Richard in 1769 and Henry in 1772. Margaret died on June 19, 1775, while Arnold was at Fort Ticonderoga following its capture. She is buried in the crypt of the Center Church on New Haven Green. The household was dominated by Arnold&#x27;s sister Hannah, even while Margaret was alive. Arnold benefited from his relationship with Mansfield, who became a partner in his business and used his position as sheriff to shield him from creditors.

Arnold was in the West Indies when the Boston Massacre took place on March 5, 1770. He wrote that he was &quot;very much shocked&quot; and wondered &quot;good God, are the Americans all asleep and tamely giving up their liberties, or are they all turned philosophers, that they don&#x27;t take immediate vengeance on such miscreants?&quot;

==Revolutionary War (American service)==
===Siege of Boston and Fort Ticonderoga===
Arnold began the war as a captain in the Connecticut militia, a position to which he was elected in March 1775. His company marched northeast the following month to assist in the Siege of Boston that followed the Battles of Lexington and Concord. He proposed an action to the Massachusetts Committee of Safety to seize Fort Ticonderoga in upstate New York, which he knew was poorly defended. They issued him a colonel&#x27;s commission on May 3, 1775, and he immediately rode off to Castleton in the disputed New Hampshire Grants (Vermont) in time to participate with Ethan Allen and his men in the capture of Fort Ticonderoga. He followed up that action with a bold raid on Fort Saint-Jean on the Richelieu River north of Lake Champlain. A Connecticut militia force arrived at Ticonderoga in June; Arnold had a dispute with its commander over control of the fort, and resigned his Massachusetts commission. He was on his way home from Ticonderoga when he learned that his wife had died earlier in June.

===Quebec expedition===
The Second Continental Congress authorized an invasion of Quebec, in part on the urging of Arnold, but he was passed over for command of the expedition. He then went to Cambridge, Massachusetts, and suggested to George Washington a second expedition to attack Quebec City via a wilderness route through Maine. He received a colonel&#x27;s commission in the Continental Army for this expedition and left Cambridge in September 1775 with 1,100 men. He arrived before Quebec City in November, after a difficult passage in which 300 men turned back and another 200 died en route. He and his men were joined by Richard Montgomery&#x27;s small army and participated in the December 31 assault on Quebec City in which Montgomery was killed and Arnold&#x27;s leg was shattered. His chaplain Rev. Samuel Spring carried him to the makeshift hospital at the Hôtel Dieu. Arnold was promoted to brigadier general for his role in reaching Quebec, and he maintained an ineffectual siege of the city until he was replaced by Major General David Wooster in April 1776.

Arnold then traveled to Montreal where he served as military commander of the city until forced to retreat by an advancing British army that had arrived at Quebec in May. He presided over the rear of the Continental Army during its retreat from Saint-Jean, where he was reported by James Wilkinson to be the last person to leave before the British arrived. He then directed the construction of a fleet to defend Lake Champlain, which was overmatched and defeated in the October 1776 Battle of Valcour Island. However, his actions at Saint-Jean and Valcour Island played a notable role in delaying the British advance against Ticonderoga until 1777.

During these actions, Arnold made a number of friends and a larger number of enemies within the army power structure and in Congress. He had established a decent relationship with George Washington, as well as Philip Schuyler and Horatio Gates, both of whom had command of the army&#x27;s Northern Department during 1775 and 1776. However, an acrimonious dispute with Moses Hazen, commander of the 2nd Canadian Regiment, boiled into Hazen&#x27;s court martial at Ticonderoga during the summer of 1776. Only action by Arnold&#x27;s superior at Ticonderoga prevented his own arrest on countercharges leveled by Hazen. He also had disagreements with John Brown and James Easton, two lower-level officers with political connections that resulted in ongoing suggestions of improprieties on his part. Brown was particularly vicious, publishing a handbill which claimed of Arnold, &quot;Money is this man&#x27;s God, and to get enough of it he would sacrifice his country&quot;.

===Rhode Island and Philadelphia===

General Washington assigned Arnold to the defense of Rhode Island following the British capture of Newport in December 1776, where the local militia were too poorly equipped to even consider an attack on the British. He took the opportunity to visit his children while near his home in New Haven, and he spent much of the winter socializing in Boston, where he unsuccessfully courted a young belle named Betsy Deblois. In February 1777, he learned that he had been passed over by Congress for promotion to major general. Washington refused his offer to resign, and wrote to members of Congress in an attempt to correct this, noting that &quot;two or three other very good officers&quot; might be lost if they persisted in making politically motivated promotions.

Arnold was on his way to Philadelphia to discuss his future when he was alerted that a British force was marching toward a supply depot in Danbury, Connecticut. He organized the militia response, along with David Wooster and Connecticut militia General Gold Selleck Silliman. He led a small contingent of militia attempting to stop or slow the British return to the coast in the Battle of Ridgefield, and was again wounded in his left leg.

He then continued on to Philadelphia, where he met with members of Congress about his rank. His action at Ridgefield, coupled with the death of Wooster due to wounds sustained in the action, resulted in his promotion to major general, although his seniority was not restored over those who had been promoted before him. Amid negotiations over that issue, Arnold wrote out a letter of resignation on July 11, the same day that word arrived in Philadelphia that Fort Ticonderoga had fallen to the British. Washington refused his resignation and ordered him north to assist with the defense there.

===Saratoga campaign===
Arnold arrived in Schuyler&#x27;s camp at Fort Edward, New York, on July 24. On August 13, Schuyler dispatched him with a force of 900 to relieve the Siege of Fort Stanwix, where he succeeded in a ruse to lift the siege. He sent an Indian messenger into the camp of British Brigadier-General Barry St. Leger with news that the approaching force was much larger and closer than it actually was; this convinced St. Leger&#x27;s Indian allies to abandon him, forcing him to give up the effort.

Arnold returned to the Hudson where General Gates had taken over command of the American army, which had retreated to a camp south of Stillwater. He then distinguished himself in both Battles of Saratoga, even though General Gates removed him from field command after the first battle, following a series of escalating disagreements and disputes that culminated in a shouting match. During the fighting in the second battle, Arnold disobeyed Gates&#x27; orders and took to the battlefield to lead attacks on the British defenses. He was again severely wounded in the left leg late in the fighting. Arnold said that it would have been better had it been in the chest instead of the leg. Burgoyne surrendered ten days after the second battle on October 17, 1777. Congress restored Arnold&#x27;s command seniority in response to his valor at Saratoga. However, he interpreted the manner in which they did so as an act of sympathy for his wounds, and not an apology or recognition that they were righting a wrong.

Arnold spent several months recovering from his injuries. He had his leg crudely set, rather than allowing it to be amputated, leaving it shorter than the right. He returned to the army at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, in May 1778 to the applause of men who had served under him at Saratoga. There he participated in the first recorded oath of allegiance, along with many other soldiers, as a sign of loyalty to the United States.

===Residence in Philadelphia===
The British withdrew from Philadelphia in June 1778, and Washington appointed Arnold military commander of the city. Historian John Shy states:
:Washington then made one of the worst decisions of his career, appointing Arnold as military governor of the rich, politically divided city. No one could have been less qualified for the position. Arnold had amply demonstrated his tendency to become embroiled in disputes, as well as his lack of political sense. Above all, he needed tact, patience, and fairness in dealing with a people deeply marked by months of enemy occupation.

Arnold began planning to capitalize financially on the change in power in Philadelphia, even before the Americans reoccupied their city. He engaged in a variety of business deals designed to profit from war-related supply movements and benefiting from the protection of his authority. Such schemes were not uncommon among American officers, but Arnold&#x27;s schemes were sometimes frustrated by powerful local politicians such as Joseph Reed, who eventually amassed enough evidence to publicly air charges against him. Arnold demanded a court martial to clear the charges, writing to Washington in May 1779: &quot;Having become a cripple in the service of my country, I little expected to meet ungrateful returns&quot;.

Arnold lived extravagantly in Philadelphia and was a prominent figure on the social scene. During the summer of 1778, he met Peggy Shippen, the 18-year-old daughter of Judge Edward Shippen IV, a Loyalist sympathizer who had done business with the British while they occupied the city; Peggy had been courted by Major John André during the British occupation of Philadelphia. She married Arnold on April 8, 1779. Shippen and her circle of friends had found methods of staying in contact with paramours across the battle lines, despite military bans on communication with the enemy. Some of this communication was effected through the services of Joseph Stansbury, a Philadelphia merchant.

==Plotting to change sides==
Historians have identified many possible factors contributing to Arnold&#x27;s treason, while some debate their relative importance. According to W. D. Wetherell, he was:

Wetherell says that the shortest explanation for his treason is that he &quot;married the wrong person&quot;.

Arnold had been badly wounded twice in battle and had lost his business in Connecticut, which made him profoundly bitter. He grew resentful of several rival and younger generals who had been promoted ahead of him and given honors which he thought he deserved. Especially galling was a long feud with the civil authorities in Philadelphia which led to his court-martial. He was also convicted of two minor charges of using his authority to make a profit. General Washington gave him a light reprimand, but it merely heightened Arnold&#x27;s sense of betrayal; nonetheless, he had already opened negotiations with the British before his court martial even began. He later said in his own defense that he was loyal to his true beliefs, yet he lied at the same time by insisting that Peggy was totally innocent and ignorant of his plans.

As early as 1778, there were signs that Arnold was unhappy with his situation and pessimistic about the country&#x27;s future. On November 10, 1778, Major General Nathanael Greene wrote to Brigadier General John Cadwalader, &quot;I am told General Arnold is become very unpopular among you oweing to his associateing too much with the Tories.&quot; A few days later, Arnold wrote to Greene and lamented over the &quot;deplorable&quot; and &quot;horrid&quot; situation of the country at that particular moment, citing the depreciating currency, disaffection of the army, and internal fighting in Congress, while predicting &quot;impending ruin&quot; if things did not change soon. Biographer Nathaniel Philbrick argues:

===Secret communications===
Early in May 1779, Arnold met with Philadelphia merchant Joseph Stansbury who then &quot;went secretly to New York with a tender of [Arnold&#x27;s] services to Sir Henry Clinton&quot;. Stansbury ignored instructions from Arnold to involve no one else in the plot, and he crossed the British lines and went to see Jonathan Odell in New York. Odell was a Loyalist working with William Franklin, the last colonial governor of New Jersey and the son of Benjamin Franklin. On May 10, Franklin introduced Stansbury to André, who had just been named the British spy chief. This was the beginning of a secret correspondence between Arnold and André, sometimes using his wife Peggy as a willing intermediary, which culminated more than a year later with Arnold&#x27;s change of sides.

André conferred with Clinton, who gave him broad authority to pursue Arnold&#x27;s offer. André then drafted instructions to Stansbury and Arnold. This initial letter opened a discussion on the types of assistance and intelligence that Arnold might provide, and included instructions for how to communicate in the future. Letters were to be passed through the women&#x27;s circle that Peggy Arnold was a part of, but only Peggy would be aware that some letters contained instructions that were to be passed on to André, written in both code and invisible ink, using Stansbury as the courier.

By July 1779, Arnold was providing the British with troop locations and strengths, as well as the locations of supply depots, all the while negotiating over compensation. At first, he asked for indemnification of his losses and £10,000 () an amount that the Continental Congress had given Charles Lee for his services in the Continental Army. Clinton was pursuing a campaign to gain control of the Hudson River Valley, and was interested in plans and information on the defenses of West Point and other defenses on the Hudson River. He also began to insist on a face-to-face meeting, and suggested to Arnold that he pursue another high-level command. By October 1779, the negotiations had ground to a halt. Furthermore, revolutionary mobs were scouring Philadelphia for Loyalists, and Arnold and the Shippen family were being threatened. Arnold was rebuffed by Congress and by local authorities in requests for security details for himself and his in-laws.

===Court martial===
Arnold&#x27;s court martial on charges of profiteering began meeting on June 1, 1779, but it was delayed until December 1779 by Clinton&#x27;s capture of Stony Point, New York, throwing the army into a flurry of activity to react. Several members on the panel of judges were ill-disposed toward Arnold over actions and disputes earlier in the war, yet Arnold was cleared of all but two minor charges on January 26, 1780. Arnold worked over the next few months to publicize this fact; however, Washington published a formal rebuke of his behavior in early April, just one week after he had congratulated Arnold on the birth of his son Edward Shippen Arnold on March 19:

Shortly after Washington&#x27;s rebuke, a Congressional inquiry into Arnold&#x27;s expenditures concluded that he had failed to account fully for his expenditures incurred during the Quebec invasion, and that he owed the Congress some £1,000 () largely because he was unable to document them. Many of these documents had been lost during the retreat from Quebec. Angry and frustrated, Arnold resigned his military command of Philadelphia in late April.

===Offer to surrender West Point===
Early in April 1780, Philip Schuyler had approached Arnold with the possibility of giving him the command at West Point. Discussions had not borne fruit between Schuyler and Washington by early June. Arnold reopened the secret channels with the British, informing them of Schuyler&#x27;s proposals and including Schuyler&#x27;s assessment of conditions at West Point. He also provided information on a proposed French-American invasion of Quebec that was to go up the Connecticut River (Arnold did not know that this proposed invasion was a ruse intended to divert British resources). On June 16, Arnold inspected West Point while on his way home to Connecticut to take care of personal business, and he sent a highly detailed report through the secret channel. When he reached Connecticut, Arnold arranged to sell his home there and began transferring assets to London through intermediaries in New York. By early July, he was back in Philadelphia, where he wrote another secret message to Clinton on July 7 which implied that his appointment to West Point was assured and that he might even provide a &quot;drawing of the works ... by which you might take [West Point] without loss&quot;.

André returned victorious from the Siege of Charleston on June 18, and both he and Clinton were immediately caught up in this news. Clinton was concerned that Washington&#x27;s army and the French fleet would join in Rhode Island, and he again fixed on West Point as a strategic point to capture. André had spies and informers keeping track of Arnold to verify his movements. Excited by the prospects, Clinton informed his superiors of his intelligence coup, but failed to respond to Arnold&#x27;s July 7 letter.

Arnold next wrote a series of letters to Clinton, even before he might have expected a response to the July 7 letter. In a July 11 letter, he complained that the British did not appear to trust him, and threatened to break off negotiations unless progress was made. On July 12, he wrote again, making explicit the offer to surrender West Point, although his price rose to £20,000 () (in addition to indemnification for his losses), with a £1,000 () down payment to be delivered with the response. These letters were delivered by Samuel Wallis, another Philadelphia businessman who spied for the British, rather than by Stansbury.

===Command at West Point===
On August 3, 1780, Arnold obtained command of West Point. On August 15, he received a coded letter from André with Clinton&#x27;s final offer: £20,000 () and no indemnification for his losses. Neither side knew for some days that the other was in agreement with that offer, due to difficulties in getting the messages across the lines. Arnold&#x27;s letters continued to detail Washington&#x27;s troop movements and provide information about French reinforcements that were being organized. On August 25, Peggy finally delivered to him Clinton&#x27;s agreement to the terms.

Arnold&#x27;s command at West Point also gave him authority over the entire American-controlled Hudson River, from Albany down to the British lines outside New York City. While en route to West Point, Arnold renewed an acquaintance with Joshua Hett Smith, who had spied for both sides and who owned a house near the western bank of the Hudson about 15 miles south of West Point.

Once Arnold established himself at West Point, he began systematically weakening its defenses and military strength. Needed repairs of the chain across the Hudson were never ordered. Troops were liberally distributed within Arnold&#x27;s command area (but only minimally at West Point itself) or furnished to Washington on request. He also peppered Washington with complaints about the lack of supplies, writing, &quot;Everything is wanting.&quot; At the same time, he tried to drain West Point&#x27;s supplies so that a siege would be more likely to succeed. His subordinates, some long-time associates, grumbled about Arnold&#x27;s unnecessary distribution of supplies and eventually concluded that he was selling them on the black market for personal gain.

On August 30, Arnold sent a letter accepting Clinton&#x27;s terms and proposing a meeting to André through yet another intermediary: William Heron, a member of the Connecticut Assembly whom he thought he could trust. In an ironic twist, Heron went into New York unaware of the significance of the letter and offered his own services to the British as a spy. He then took the letter back to Connecticut, suspicious of Arnold&#x27;s actions, where he delivered it to the head of the Connecticut militia. General Samuel Holden Parsons laid it aside, seeing a letter written as a coded business discussion. Four days later, Arnold sent a ciphered letter with similar content into New York through the services of the wife of a prisoner of war. Eventually, a meeting was set for September 11 near Dobbs Ferry. This meeting was thwarted when British gunboats in the river fired on his boat, not being informed of his impending arrival.

===Plot exposed===
Arnold and André finally met on September 21 at the Joshua Hett Smith House. On the morning of September 22, from their position at Teller&#x27;s Point, two American rebels (under the command of Colonel James Livingston), John &quot;Jack&quot; Peterson and Moses Sherwood, fired on , the ship that was intended to carry André back to New York. This action did little damage besides giving the captain, Andrew Sutherland, a splinter in his nose—but the splinter prompted the &quot;Vulture&quot; to retreat, forcing André to return to New York overland. Arnold wrote out passes for André so that he would be able to pass through the lines, and he also gave him plans for West Point.

André was captured near Tarrytown, New York, on Saturday, September 23, by three Westchester militiamen. They found the papers exposing the plot to capture West Point and passed them on to their superiors, but André convinced the unsuspecting Colonel John Jameson, to whom he was delivered, to send him back to Arnold at West Point—but he never reached West Point. Major Benjamin Tallmadge was a member of the Continental Army&#x27;s Culper Ring, a network of spies established under Washington&#x27;s orders, and he insisted that Jameson order the prisoner to be intercepted and brought back. Jameson reluctantly recalled the lieutenant who had been delivering André into Arnold&#x27;s custody, but he then sent the same lieutenant as a messenger to notify Arnold of André&#x27;s arrest.

Arnold learned of André&#x27;s capture the morning of September 24 while waiting for Washington, with whom he was going to have breakfast at his headquarters in British Colonel Beverley Robinson&#x27;s former summer house on the east bank of the Hudson. Upon receiving Jameson&#x27;s message, however, he learned that Jameson had sent Washington the papers which André was carrying. Arnold immediately hastened to the shore and ordered bargemen to row him downriver to where HMS &quot;Vulture&quot; was anchored, fleeing on it to New York City. From the ship, he wrote a letter to Washington requesting that Peggy be given safe passage to her family in Philadelphia—which Washington granted.

When Washington was presented with proof of Arnold&#x27;s treason, he said, &quot;Arnold has betrayed me. Whom can we trust now?&quot; He remained calm when presented with evidence of Arnold&#x27;s treason, and was reportedly &quot;the only one at West Point that day to act calmly.&quot; He did, however, investigate its extent, and suggested that he was willing to exchange André for Arnold during negotiations with Clinton concerning André&#x27;s fate. Clinton refused this suggestion; after a military tribunal, André was hanged at Tappan, New York, on October 2. Washington also infiltrated men into New York City in an attempt to capture Arnold, which included Sergeant Major John Champe. This plan very nearly succeeded, but Arnold changed living quarters prior to sailing for Virginia in December and thus avoided capture. He justified his actions in an open letter titled &quot;To the Inhabitants of America&quot;, published in newspapers in October 1780. He also wrote in the letter to Washington requesting safe passage for Peggy: &quot;Love to my country actuates my present conduct, however it may appear inconsistent to the world, who very seldom judge right of any man&#x27;s actions.&quot;

==Revolutionary War (British service)==
===Raids in Virginia and Connecticut colonies===
The British gave Arnold a brigadier general&#x27;s commission with an annual income of several hundred pounds, but they paid him only £6,315 () plus an annual pension of £360 () for his defection because his plot had failed. In December 1780, he led a force of 1,600 troops into Virginia under orders from Clinton, where he captured Richmond by surprise and then went on a rampage through Virginia, destroying supply houses, foundries, and mills. This activity brought out Virginia&#x27;s militia led by Colonel Sampson Mathews, and Arnold eventually retreated to Portsmouth to be reinforced or to evacuate.

The pursuing American army included the Marquis de Lafayette, who was under orders from Washington to hang Arnold summarily if he was captured. British reinforcements arrived in late March led by Major General William Phillips who served under Lieutenant General John Burgoyne at Saratoga. Phillips led further raids across Virginia, including a defeat of Baron von Steuben at Petersburg, but he died of fever on May 12, 1781. Arnold commanded the army only until May 20, when Lieutenant General Charles Cornwallis arrived with the southern army and took over. One colonel wrote to Clinton concerning Arnold: &quot;There are many officers who must wish some other general in command.&quot; Cornwallis ignored Arnold&#x27;s advice to locate a permanent base away from the coast, advice that might have averted his surrender at Yorktown.

On his return to New York in June, Arnold made a variety of proposals for attacks on economic targets to force the Americans to end the war. Clinton was uninterested in most of his aggressive ideas, but finally authorized him to raid the port of New London, Connecticut. He led a force of more than 1,700 men which burned most of New London to the ground on September 4, causing damage estimated at $500,000. They also attacked and captured Fort Griswold across the river in Groton, Connecticut, slaughtering the Americans after they surrendered following the Battle of Groton Heights—and all these deeds were done just a few miles down the Thames River from Norwich, where Arnold grew up. However, British casualties were high; nearly one quarter of the force was killed or wounded, and Clinton declared that he could ill afford any more such victories.

===British surrender and exile in England===
Even before Cornwallis&#x27;s surrender in October, Arnold had requested permission from Clinton to go to England to give Lord George Germain his thoughts on the war in person. He renewed that request when he learned of the surrender, which Clinton then granted. On December 8, 1781, Arnold and his family left New York for England.

In London, Arnold aligned himself with the Tories, advising Germain and George III to renew the fight against the Americans. In the House of Commons, Edmund Burke expressed the hope that the government would not put Arnold &quot;at the head of a part of a British army&quot; lest &quot;the sentiments of true honour, which every British officer [holds] dearer than life, should be afflicted&quot;. The anti-war Whigs had gained the upper hand in Parliament, and Germain was forced to resign, with the government of Lord North falling not long after.

Arnold then applied to accompany Lieutenant General Guy Carleton, who was going to New York to replace Clinton as commander-in-chief, but the request went nowhere. Other attempts all failed to gain positions within the government or the British East India Company over the next few years, and he was forced to subsist on the reduced pay of non-wartime service. His reputation also came under criticism in the British press, especially when compared to Major André who was celebrated for his patriotism. One critic said that he was a &quot;mean mercenary, who, having adopted a cause for the sake of plunder, quits it when convicted of that charge&quot;. George Johnstone turned him down for a position in the East India Company and explained: &quot;Although I am satisfied with the purity of your conduct, the generality do not think so. While this is the case, no power in this country could suddenly place you in the situation you aim at under the East India Company.&quot;

==To Canada, then back to England==
In 1785, Arnold and his son Richard moved to Saint John, New Brunswick, where they speculated in land and established a business doing trade with the West Indies. Arnold purchased large tracts of land in the Maugerville area, and acquired city lots in Saint John and Fredericton. Delivery of his first ship the &quot;Lord Sheffield&quot; was accompanied by accusations from the builder that Arnold had cheated him; Arnold replied that he had merely deducted the contractually agreed amount when the ship was delivered late. After her first voyage, Arnold returned to London in 1786 to bring his family to Saint John. While there, he disentangled himself from a lawsuit over an unpaid debt that Peggy had been fighting while he was away, paying £900 () to settle a £12,000 () loan that he had taken while living in Philadelphia. The family moved to Saint John in 1787, where Arnold created an uproar with a series of bad business deals and petty lawsuits. The most serious of these was a slander suit which he won against a former business partner; and following this, townspeople burned him in effigy in front of his house, as Peggy and the children watched. The family left Saint John to return to London in December 1791.

In July 1792, Arnold fought a bloodless duel with the Earl of Lauderdale after the Earl impugned his honor in the House of Lords. With the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, Arnold outfitted a privateer, while continuing to do business in the West Indies, even though the hostilities increased the risk. He was imprisoned by the French colonial authorities in Guadeloupe amid accusations of spying for the British, and narrowly eluded hanging by escaping to the blockading British fleet after bribing his guards. He helped organize militia forces in the British West Indies, receiving praise from the landowners for his efforts on their behalf. He hoped that this work would earn him wider respect and a new command; instead, it earned him and his sons a land-grant of in Upper Canada, near present-day Renfrew, Ontario.

==Death and funeral==
In January 1801, Arnold&#x27;s health began to decline. He had suffered from gout since 1775, and the condition attacked his unwounded leg to the point where he was unable to go to sea. The other leg ached constantly, and he walked only with a cane. His physicians diagnosed him as having dropsy, and a visit to the countryside only temporarily improved his condition. He died after four days of delirium on June 14, 1801, at the age of 60. Legend has it that, when he was on his deathbed, he said, &quot;Let me die in this old uniform in which I fought my battles. May God forgive me for ever having put on another,&quot; but this story may be apocryphal. Arnold was buried at St. Mary&#x27;s Church in Battersea, England. As a result of a clerical error in the parish records, his remains were removed to an unmarked mass grave during church renovations a century later. His funeral procession boasted &quot;seven mourning coaches and four state carriages&quot;; the funeral was without military honors.

Arnold left a small estate, reduced in size by his debts, which Peggy undertook to clear. Among his bequests were considerable gifts to one John Sage, perhaps an illegitimate son or grandson.

==Legacy==
Benedict Arnold became permanently synonymous with &quot;traitor&quot; soon after his betrayal became public.

Biblical themes were often invoked. One 1794 textbook stated that &quot;Satan entered into the heart of Benedict.&quot; Benjamin Franklin wrote that &quot;Judas sold only one man, Arnold three millions&quot;, and Alexander Scammell described his actions as &quot;black as hell&quot;. In Arnold&#x27;s home town of Norwich, Connecticut, someone scrawled &quot;the traitor&quot; next to his record of birth at city hall, and all of his family&#x27;s gravestones have been destroyed except his mother&#x27;s.

Arnold was aware of his reputation in his home country, and French statesman Talleyrand described meeting him in Falmouth, Cornwall in 1794:

Talleyrand continued, &quot;I must confess that I felt much pity for him, for which political puritans will perhaps blame me, but with which I do not reproach myself, for I witnessed his agony&quot;.

Early biographers attempted to describe Arnold&#x27;s entire life in terms of treacherous or morally questionable behavior. The first major biography of his life was &quot;The Life and Treason of Benedict Arnold&quot;, published in 1832 by historian Jared Sparks; it was particularly harsh in showing how Arnold&#x27;s treacherous character was formed out of childhood experiences. George Canning Hill authored a series of moralistic biographies in the mid-19th century and began his 1865 biography of Arnold: &quot;Benedict, the Traitor, was born…&quot;. Social historian Brian Carso notes that, as the 19th century progressed, the story of Arnold&#x27;s betrayal was portrayed with near-mythical proportions as a part of the national history. It was invoked again as sectional conflicts increased in the years before the American Civil War. Washington Irving used it as part of an argument against dismemberment of the union in his 1857 &quot;Life of George Washington&quot;, pointing out that the unity of New England and the southern states which led to independence was made possible in part by holding West Point. Jefferson Davis and other southern secessionist leaders were unfavorably compared to Arnold, implicitly and explicitly likening the idea of secession to treason. &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; published an article in 1861 describing Confederate leaders as &quot;a few men directing this colossal treason, by whose side Benedict Arnold shines white as a saint&quot;.

Fictional invocations of Benedict Arnold&#x27;s name carry strongly negative overtones. A moralistic children&#x27;s tale entitled &quot;The Cruel Boy&quot; was widely circulated in the 19th century. It described a boy who stole eggs from birds&#x27; nests, pulled wings off insects, and engaged in other sorts of wanton cruelty, who then grew up to become a traitor to his country. The boy is not identified until the end of the story, when his place of birth is given as Norwich, Connecticut, and his name is given as Benedict Arnold. However, not all depictions of Arnold were so negative. Some theatrical treatments of the 19th century explored his duplicity, seeking to understand rather than demonize it.

Canadian historians have treated Arnold as a relatively minor figure. His difficult time in New Brunswick led historians to summarize it as full of &quot;controversy, resentment, and legal entanglements&quot; and to conclude that he was disliked by both Americans and Loyalists living there. Historian Barry Wilson points out that Arnold&#x27;s descendants established deep roots in Canada, becoming leading settlers in Upper Canada and Saskatchewan. His descendants are spread across Canada, most of all those of John Sage, who adopted the Arnold surname.

==Honors==
The Boot Monument at Saratoga National Historical Park pays tribute to Arnold but does not mention his name. It was donated by Civil War General John Watts DePeyster, and its inscription reads: &quot;In memory of the most brilliant soldier of the Continental army, who was desperately wounded on this spot, winning for his countrymen the decisive battle of the American Revolution, and for himself the rank of Major General.&quot; The victory monument at Saratoga has four niches, three of which are occupied by statues of Generals Gates, Schuyler, and Morgan. The fourth niche is pointedly empty.

There are plaques in an old cadet chapel in the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, commemorating all of the generals who served in the Revolution. One plaque bears only a rank and a date but no name: &quot;major general… born 1740&quot;. Historical markers in Danvers, Massachusetts, and Newburyport, Massachusetts commemorate Arnold&#x27;s 1775 expedition to Quebec. There are also historical markers bearing his name at Wyman Lake Rest Area on US-201 north of Moscow, Maine, on the western bank of Lake Champlain, New York, and two in Skowhegan, Maine.

The house where Arnold lived at 62 Gloucester Place in central London bears a plaque describing him as an &quot;American Patriot&quot;, in the sense that he &quot;felt that what he was doing was in the interest of America&quot;. He was buried at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Battersea, England which has a commemorative stained glass window. The window&#x27;s devices commingle the flags of the United States and the United Kingdom.
==Marriages and children==
Arnold had three sons with Margaret Mansfield:
* Benedict Arnold (1768–1795) (Captain, British Army in Jamaica)
* Richard Arnold (1769–1847) (Lieutenant, American Legion cavalry)
* Henry Arnold (1772–1826) (Lieutenant, American Legion cavalry)

He had five children with Peggy Shippen:
* Edward Shippen Arnold (1780–1813) (Lieutenant, British Army in India; see Bengal Army)
* James Robertson Arnold (1781–1854) (Lieutenant General, Royal Engineers)
* George Arnold (1787–1828) (Lieutenant Colonel, 2nd (or 7th) Bengal Cavalry)
* Sophia Matilda Arnold (1785–1828)
* William Fitch Arnold (1794–1846) (Captain, 9th Queen&#x27;s Royal Lancers)

Arnold left significant bequests in his will to John Sage (born 1786), who has been identified by some historians as a possible illegitimate son, but may also have been a grandchild.

<doc id="417860" wikidata="Q4334776" url="?curid=417860" title="Little Girl Lost (The Twilight Zone)">
<text>&quot;Little Girl Lost&quot; is episode 91 of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. It is about a young girl who has accidentally passed through an opening into another dimension. Her parents and their friend attempt to locate and retrieve her. It is based on the 1953 science fiction short story by Richard Matheson. The title of the episode comes from a poem by William Blake, from his collection &quot;Songs of Innocence and of Experience&quot;.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
A married couple, Chris and Ruth Miller, are awakened by the whimpering of their little daughter, Tina. Chris goes to see what the trouble is. Their dog, Mack, begins to bark from the backyard. Chris cannot find Tina either in or under the bed, even though her pleas for help seem to be coming from nearby, yet far away. He calls Ruth into the room, and she is similarly mystified. Chris phones his physicist friend, Bill, for help, and opens the door to let the incessantly barking Mack into the house. The dog runs under the bed and disappears, but can still be heard barking, again close, but far away.

Bill arrives and helps Chris move the bed so that he can physically scan the area where it was, marking the legs with books. When this proves fruitless, Bill examines the wall behind the bed. Finding that his hand can pass easily through the wall and to another dimension, he draws marks on the wall outlining the apparent boundary. He explains to Chris and Ruth that sometimes lines in a three-dimensional universe run parallel with, rather than perpendicular to, the fourth dimension. He warns them that they know nothing of what might lie beyond this portal, and should they follow Tina into the fourth dimension, they would only become hopelessly lost as well, since it is not manifested like the three humans can perceive.

Chris calls to Mack to guide Tina back. Mack leads Tina to the source of Chris&#x27;s voice, but they still cannot find the entrance. Despite Bill&#x27;s warnings, Chris reaches into the portal and falls into the fourth dimension, an abstract, crystalline landscape that seems distorted, and constantly turning upside down and sideways. Bill advises him not to move. Chris sees Tina and Mack and calls them towards him. Bill calls for him to hurry. When Tina and Mack close in on Chris, Bill grabs them and pulls them back into the bedroom. Ruth rushes Tina to another room.

Bill explains that Chris was only halfway through the portal, despite Chris&#x27;s perception that he was standing up in the new dimension. Bill was in fact holding onto Chris the entire time. He was telling Chris to hurry because the portal was closing. Bill knocks on the wall, showing that the portal has completely solidified and closed. He explains that if Chris had taken a few more seconds, the two halves of his body might have become trapped in different dimensions.

==Closing narration==
==Production notes==
The opening is slightly altered beginning with this episode. The graphics and words are the same, but there are subtle differences in the acoustics for the theme music.

Matheson wrote the short story based on a real-life incident involving his young daughter, who fell off her bed while asleep and rolled against a wall. Despite hearing their daughter&#x27;s cries for help, Matheson and his wife were initially unable to locate her.

The voice of Tina in the alternate dimension was played by voice actor Rhoda Williams, who was then 32 years old.

==Critical reception==
The critic Camille Paglia calls &quot;Little Girl Lost&quot; the &quot;first great script&quot; of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; in &quot;Sexual Personae&quot; (1990).

==References in other media==
&quot;Little Girl Lost&quot; was parodied in &quot;Homer3&quot;, a segment of &quot;Treehouse of Horror VI&quot;, an episode from the seventh season of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. In the episode, the two-dimensional characters attempt to retrieve Homer from the third dimension. Homer likens his entrance to the third dimension to &quot;something out of that twilighty show about that zone&quot;.

An area of the queue for the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror theme park attractions in California and Paris uses subtle effects to simulate air currents coming out of a solid wall, as well as playing a subtle recording of the little girl&#x27;s dialogue at intervals. In the exit area of the Florida version of the attraction, there is an area of the wall outlined in chalk, exactly like the portal in the episode. It has also been cited as one of the most influential episodes in the development of the ride, most notably with the &quot;5th Dimension&quot; scene in the Florida version.

Some (including Richard Matheson) have noted similarities between the episode and the 1982 film &quot;Poltergeist&quot;.

Peter Straub alludes to the episode in his novel &quot;Lost Boy, Lost Girl&quot;.

==Theoretical basis==
Although not intended by the writers, the hole into the other dimension was later given as an example of a &quot;Riemannian cut&quot;, which is a type of wormhole formed when two spaces join at the same set of points.

==Music==
Bernard Herrmann&#x27;s score for the episode is written for an unusual chamber ensemble of four flutes (doubling on piccolos, and alto and bass flutes), four harps, percussion (one player, utilizing tambourine, tam-tams, and vibraphone), and viola d&#x27;amore. It has been performed as a concert suite by the San Francisco Composers Chamber Orchestra.
The episode&#x27;s director, Paul Stewart, worked with Herrmann as associate producer of Orson Welles&#x27;s &quot;The Mercury Theatre on the Air&quot; and played the butler Raymond in the first film Herrmann scored, &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;.

<doc id="417861" wikidata="Q242502" url="?curid=417861" title="Flag of American Samoa">
<text>The flag of American Samoa consists of a red-edged white triangle pointing towards the hoist charged with a bald eagle clutching a war club and fly-whisk, with dark blue upper and lower triangles. Adopted in April 1960 to replace the &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; as the official flag of the territory, it has been the flag of the Territory of American Samoa since that year. The colors used epitomize the traditional colors of the United States and Samoa.

The bald eagle and the blue, white and red colors symbolize the country&#x27;s ties to the United States. The eagle holds a staff and a war club, two traditional symbols of the Samoan chiefs.

According to the flag&#x27;s designer, Uinifareti Rapi Sotoa, the white section represents the Manuʻa District. The two blue parts represent the two districts on Tutuila Island: The Eastern District and the Western District. The red in the middle is a symbol for the ocean between Tutuila Island and the Manuʻa Islands. The eagle is a confirmation of the unity between the United States and American Samoa. The &quot;fue&quot; and &quot;uatogi&quot; carried by the eagle represent the ability of Samoans to compromise but also that they can defend themselves when necessary.

==History==

Before the first Europeans set foot on the islands in the 18th century, Samoa did not use any flags. They first utilized flags during the 1800s, although it is unclear which ones were flown due to partial documentation. The islands were contested by Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States at the turn of the century; the three countries resolved the dispute by dividing Samoa amongst themselves during the Tripartite Convention in 1899. As a result of an agreement with the high chiefs of the island of Tutuila, the United States took control over easternmost Samoa on April 17, 1900, and raised their flag that same day. It went on to be the only official flag of American Samoa until 1960.

In the mid-20th century, Samoans began to take a more active role in the local government. Consequently, deliberations began over a new territorial flag and the Samoans were invited to propose ideas. Local government leaders and the U.S. Army Institute of Heraldry then designed the flag while incorporating these ideas into it. The flag was officially adopted April 17, 1960, sixty years to the day the U.S. first raised the American flag over Samoa.

The flag was raised for the first time on Flag Day, April 17, 1960. In the previous year, the flag&#x27;s design had won the flag design competition at Samoana High School, designed by high school student Fareti Sotoa. A draft was sent to the U.S. Army&#x27;s Institute of Heraldry.

A copy of the flag, which was brought to the moon by astronauts on four Apollo missions from 1969 to 1971, is on display at the Jean P. Haydon Museum in Pago Pago.

American Samoa holds a Flag Day celebration on April 17 each year.

==Design==
The flag consists of a large white triangle, pointed towards the hoist, bordered in red and charged with an eagle, all on a blue field. The U.S. national bird holds a yellow &quot;uatogi&quot; (a war club) in its claws.

The colors and symbols of the flag carry cultural, political, and regional meanings. The red, white and blue represent the colors traditionally utilized by both the United States and Samoa. The bald eagle represents the U.S. and features on the flag, although it does not live in American Samoa. It clutches two Samoan symbols, alluding to the United States&#x27; guardianship over American Samoa, as well as evoking the Great Seal of the United States. The symbols are a &quot;uatogi&quot; (a war club, epitomizing the government&#x27;s power) and a &quot;fue&quot; (a fly-whisk, representing the wisdom of traditional Samoan leaders).

<doc id="417863" wikidata="Q337503" url="?curid=417863" title="Slax">
<text>Slax is a LiveCD Linux distribution developed by Tomáš Matějíček and based on upstream customizable Linux distributions. Packages can be added by apt package manager or can be prepared as modules. The tagline for Slax refers to itself as &quot;your pocket operating system&quot;.

== Features ==
One of the main benefits of the Slax distribution is its ease of customization. Additional software can be added and removed, using Slax modules. A traditional package manager such as Debian&#x27;s APT is not required to load additional software; Slax modules are completely self-contained. However, APT is fully supported. Users can also modify the default CD image or USB drive installation to customize the packages available in the distribution on boot. Slax also allows Debian packages to be converted into Slax modules.

Slax modules are compressed read-only SquashFS file system images that are compressed with a LZMA compressor. The various modules are stacked together to build the complete Slax root directory. A supplemental writable layer (a tmpfs file system) is put on the top of the stack to implement the write functionality.

The stackable file system of choice changed between Slax versions 5 (UnionFS) and 6 (aufs), as did the module file name extension (changed from to ).

==Versions==

===Slackware-Live! 1===
Slackware-Live! 1.8.0.1 was based on Slackware 8.0. Slackware-Live! 1.81.0.21 was based on Slackware 8.1.

===Slackware-Live! 2===
Slackware-Live! 2.9.0.1 was based on Slackware 9.0.

===Slax 3===
Slackware-Live! was renamed to SLAX in 3.0.24.

===Slax 4===
Slax 4.0.1 is based on 4.0.1 linux live scripts with Linux Kernel 2.4.25.
Slax 4.2.0 special is based on SLAX 4.2.0.

===Slax 5===
There were five editions of Slax 5:
* Slax Standard was the standard edition for normal personal use, introduced in Slax 5.0.0.
* Slax KillBill included Wine, DOSBox and QEMU to run DOS and Microsoft Windows applications, introduced with Slax 5.0.2.
* Slax Server supplied additional Internet functionality and came with pre-configured DNS, DHCP, Samba, HTTP, FTP, MySQL, SMTP, POP3, IMAP and SSH servers and several other server applications, introduced with Slax 5.0.8.
* Slax Popcorn was a minimalistic edition focused on browsing and multimedia playback, introduced with Slax 5.0.5. It featured Mozilla Firefox as the default web browser and the lightweight Xfce as a desktop environment instead of KDE.
* Slax Frodo was a &quot;bare bones&quot; edition, providing only a full-featured text-only environment, particularly focused on computers with small amounts of RAM.

The Fluxbox Window Manager was an option in all editions except Frodo.

Slax 5.0.0 standard edition is based on Slackware-current and Linux Live 5 with UnionFS and SquashFS, Linux kernel 2.6.11.6.

===Slax 6===
Slax 6 is offered in a single version and completely relies on modules (additional packages) for extra features. From version 6, modules are based on LZMA compression, but some compatibility was initially provided between the obsolete .mo modules used by Slax version 5 and the more recent modules of version 6. As there have been some changes between Linux kernel versions during sub-version releases of Slax 6, however, the .mo modules of Slax 5 are now considered obsolete. Each module or package should be compiled for compatibility with the Linux kernel currently in use.

===Slax 7===
Slax version 7 was announced on the developer&#x27;s blog (which has now been integrated into a newly refreshed Slax website). Slax 7 supports both 64-bit and 32-bit architectures, and according to its download page, &quot;is available in more than 50 languages&quot;. It also features a stripped-down version of KDE 4, a new wallpaper, and a new module system.

===Slax 9===
In November 2017, the developer announced the release of version 9. This latest edition is heavily rewritten and is based on Debian, and relies on APT to add packages. The default builds (both 32-bit and 64-bit) contain Fluxbox window manager with a terminal, Chromium web browser, LeafPad text editor, calculator, file manager, and network manager.

===Slax 11===
Slax 11.2 is based on Debian Bullseye (version 11.2). Slax 11.3 is based on Debian version 11.3.0. Slax 11.4 is based on Debian version 11.4.0. Slax 11.6 is based on Debian version 11.6.0.

===Slax 15===
Slax 15.0 is based on Slackware 15.

<doc id="417867" wikidata="Q273273" url="?curid=417867" title="Rudolph of France">
<text>Rudolph (), sometimes called Ralph (; 890 – 14/15 January 936), was the king of West Francia (France) from 923 until his death in 936. He was elected to succeed his father-in-law, Robert I, and spent much of his reign defending his realm from Viking raids.

==Name==
In contemporary Latin documents, his name is usually &quot;Rodulfus&quot;, from the Germanic roots &quot;hruod&quot;, &quot;fame, glory&quot;, and &quot;wulf&quot;, &quot;wolf&quot;. Rodulf and Rudolf are variants of this name; the French form is &quot;Rodolphe&quot;. By contrast, the king is normally known as &quot;Raoul&quot; in modern French, a name which derives from &quot;Radulfus&quot;, from Germanic &quot;rad&quot;, &quot;counsel&quot;, and &quot;wulf&quot; (whence Ralph). Although this name is of different origin, it was sometimes used interchangeably by contemporaries with &quot;Rodulfus&quot;. The king himself, however, always used &quot;Rodulfus&quot;, as on his personal seal. Nonetheless, he is sometimes called Ralph (from &quot;Raoul&quot;) or Radulf in English.

==Background==
Rudolph was born around 890, the son of Richard the Justiciar and Adelaide of Auxerre. He inherited the Duchy of Burgundy from his father in 921 and married Emma, daughter of King Robert I of France. He was elected to succeed his father-in-law, who was killed at the Battle of Soissons against the deposed King Charles the Simple. He was crowned by Walter, the archbishop of Sens, at Saint-Médard de Soissons on 13 July 923. On assuming the crown he passed the Duchy of Burgundy to his younger brother, Hugh the Black.

==Reign==

Rudolph&#x27;s first act was to lead an army against the king of East Francia Henry the Fowler, who had made a pact with King Robert I at Jülich earlier in the year. After trying to annex Lotharingia Henry met Rudolph with a considerably-sized army and made peace again. However, in 925 Henry attacked Gilbert, Duke of Lorraine, and took over Lotharingia permanently, Rudolph being in no position to resist.

In 924 Vikings made a fresh series of raids into West Francia. From the Loire Valley they threatened Hugh the Great, brother of Queen Emma, but Rudolph did nothing. They attacked Burgundy, the domain of Rudolph&#x27;s brother, but were repulsed, and moved on to Melun, where they threatened the royal lands. Joined only by his ecclesiastic vassals and Herbert, Rudolph recruited troops in Burgundy, while Hugh the Great was convinced to join him. After the Vikings left, the Normans, whom Charles the Simple had settled in Duchy of Normandy in 911, began ravaging that whole region. Herbert and Arnulf I of Flanders joined Rudolph and together they took Eu, but were ambushed near Fauquembergues where the king was wounded, the count of Ponthieu killed, and many Normans left dead on the field.

Also in that year, Rudolph conversed with Louis the Blind, king of Provence, over the Magyars, the newest barbarian migrants to Europe, then menacing Louis. In 930 Magyars invaded the region around Rheims, but left before the king could engage them. In 935 Magyars invaded Burgundy and Rudolph brought a large army against them, causing their retreat without a battle. West Francia was temporarily safe from both Vikings and Magyars at Rudolph&#x27;s death.

In order to increase his own power, Herbert II of Vermandois used his royal prisoner as a bargaining tool to secure the Archbishopric of Rheims for his son Hugh in 925 and the County of Laon for his son Odo in 927. The complaints from Rudolph led Herbert II to bring Charles before William Longsword, the count of Rouen, for homage and then to Rheims to press Charles&#x27; claim on Pope John X. In 928 Herbert II finally got possession of Laon, but the next year Charles died at Péronne and Herbert II lost his leverage against Rudolph.

After defeating Vikings of the Limousin, Rudolph received the allegiance of the Aquitainians and homage from William Longsword, to whom he granted in 933 the islands off the coast of Normandy, now referred to as the Channel Islands.

In 929 Rudolph attempted to reduce the power of Duke Ebalus of Aquitaine. He withdrew from him access to Berry, and in 932 granted the title of prince of Gothia to the count of Toulouse, Raymond Pons, and his brother of Rouergue, Ermengol. He also transferred the County of Auvergne to Raymond. Moreover, the territory of the march which was under the control of the lord of Charroux was transformed into an independent county. Later, however, Rudolph was campaigning with Ebalus in the south to eradicate the last Viking strongholds there. He then proceeded aggressively against Herbert II, marching into Rheims and replacing Hugh with Artald in 931. Then, joined by Hugh the Great, Rudolph burned Herbert&#x27;s fortresses and cornered him in Château-Thierry, where he had first imprisoned Charles, from 933 to 934. The two made peace in 935 and Rudolph fell ill, dying a few months later on 14 or 15 January 936, leaving no sons.

<text>The flag of Barbados was designed by Grantley W. Prescod and was officially adopted to represent Barbados at midnight on 30 November 1966, the day the country gained independence. 

The flag was chosen as part of a nationwide open contest held by the government. Prescod&#x27;s design won the over a field of one thousand entries. The flag is a triband design, with the outermost stripes coloured ultramarine, to represent the sea and the sky, and the middle stripe coloured gold, to represent the sand. Within the middle band is displayed the head of a trident. This trident is meant to represent the trident of Poseidon, most visibly held by Britiannia in Barbados&#x27; colonial coat-of-arms. The fact that it is broken is meant to represent the breaking of colonial rule in Barbados and independence from the British Empire.

After Prescod&#x27;s design was selected as the winner of the contest, he was asked to make several flags as a personal request from Errol Barrow, the nation&#x27;s first prime minister. Prescod constructed seven flags out of fabrics purchased from a department store. The flag was raised for the first time in a ceremony by Lieutenant Hartley Dottin of the Barbados Regiment. 

From its independence in 1966, Barbados also had a royal standard for Queen Elizabeth II and a standard for the governor-general until 2021 when these flags were retired after Barbados officially became a republic. Barbados now uses the Presidential Standard.

==History==
After some time as a British colony, Barbados became part of the British Windward Islands in 1833, with the Union Jack as its official flag. It was reestablished as the colony of Barbados in 1885 and remained that way until 1958; during this time, the flag of the colony consisted of a Blue Ensign which was defaced with the colonial seal. From 1958 to 1962, Barbados was under the control of the West Indies Federation, who used the so-called &quot;Sun and Seas Flag&quot;, consisting of a circular orange &quot;sun&quot; atop a blue field with four wavy white lines. After control was retaken by the United Kingdom from 1962 to 1966, following the dissolution of the West Indies Federation, the Barbadian legislature made their case for independence. Barbados became an independent nation on 30 November 1966. At midnight on that day, the modern-day flag came into effect as the first official flag of an independent Barbados and was raised for the first time in a ceremony by Lieutenant Hartley Dottin, a member of the Barbados Regiment.

The design of the flag was created by Grantley W. Prescod, an art teacher, and was chosen as the winner of an open competition arranged by the Barbados government and judged by seven individuals. Over one thousand entries were received, with the exact number being 1,029. He was awarded a $500 cash prize, which was donated to a popular newspaper publishing company, a scroll from the Barbadian government, and a gold medal. In addition to designing the flag, Prescod also constructed the first physical flag, at the request of Prime Minister Errol Barrow. After choosing fabrics of the right colors at a department store, Prescod made &quot;approximately seven flags&quot;.

==Design==

The flag consists of a triband of two bands of ultramarine, which are said to stand for the ocean surrounding the country and the sky, though some sources attribute both blue stripes to be representing the ocean. The blue stripes are separated by a golden middle band, which represents the sand. A black trident head, commonly called the broken trident, is centred in the golden band, and the fact that the staff is missing is significant. The trident symbol was taken from Barbados&#x27; colonial badge, where the trident of Poseidon is shown with Britannia holding it. The broken lower part symbolises a symbolic break from its status as a colony. The three points of the trident represent the three principles of democracy: government of the people, government for the people, and government by the people.

The official British Standard colour code numbers for the flag are:
Ultramarine — BCC 148, Gold — BS O/002.

==Historical and variant flags==
From its independence in 1966, Barbados had standards for Queen Elizabeth II, as well as the governor-general and prime minister. The first of these consisted of a yellow field with a blue circular disk containing the letter &quot;E&quot; and a crown in the centre, surrounded by gold roses; this device is displayed on Elizabeth II&#x27;s personal flag. This logo is placed atop a giant bearded fig (&quot;Ficus citrifolia&quot;), and a pride of Barbados flower (&quot;Caesalpinia pulcherrima&quot;) is displayed in each upper corner. This flag was used only when the Queen was visiting the nation or representing them abroad as their head of state. The standard of the governor-general is a navy blue field with St Edward&#x27;s Crown in the centre; atop the crown sits a lion which is itself crowned, and below the crown is displayed a banner which reads &quot;BARBADOS&quot;. Both of these flags were retired when Barbados ceased to be a Commonwealth realm, instead becoming a republic effective 30 November 2021.

The standard of the prime minister consists of the coat of arms within a white circle at the flag&#x27;s centre. From the upper-left to the lower-right of the flag runs a black- and white-striped rope, which fimbriates the white circle and the line dividing the portion of the field coloured blue and the portion of the field coloured yellow. This flag was introduced with the first prime minister in 1966 and is still in use. The standard of the president is noticeably simpler; it consists only of a dark navy field with the coat of arms in the centre, surrounded by a wreath of gold flowers. Just below the arms is a small version of the &quot;broken trident&quot; symbol, coloured gold.

The Barbadian naval ensign follows much the same pattern as that of the United Kingdom, the White Ensign; rather than a Union Jack, the canton is occupied by the national flag of Barbados. The Barbados Defence Force, the nation&#x27;s combined armed forces, has its own flag as well, consisting of the organisation&#x27;s logo atop a green field.

<text>The national flag of Belarus is an unequal red-green bicolour with a red-on-white ornament pattern placed at the hoist (staff) end. The current design was introduced in 2012 by the State Committee for Standardisation of the Republic of Belarus, and is adapted from a design approved in a May 1995 referendum. It is a modification of the 1951 flag used while the country was a republic of the Soviet Union. Changes made to the Soviet-era flag were the removal of communist symbols – the hammer and sickle and the red star – as well as the reversal of the colours in the ornament pattern. Since the 1995 referendum, several flags used by Belarusian government officials and agencies have been modelled on this national flag.

Historically, the white-red-white flag was used by the Belarusian People&#x27;s Republic in 1918 before Belarus became a Soviet Republic, then by the Belarusian national movement in West Belarus followed by widespread unofficial use during the Nazi occupation of Belarus between 1942 and 1944, and again after it regained its independence in 1991 until the 1995 referendum. Opposition groups have continued to use this flag, though its display in Belarus has been restricted by the government of Belarus, which claims it is linked with Nazi collaboration due to its use by Belarusian collaborators during World War II. The white-red-white flag has been used in protests against the government, most recently the 2020–2021 Belarusian protests, and by the Belarusian diaspora.

==Design==
The basic design of the national flag of Belarus was first described in Presidential Decree No. 214 of 7 June 1995. The flag is a rectangular cloth consisting of two horizontal stripes: a red upper stripe (which was inspired by the flag of the Soviet Union) covering two-thirds of the flag&#x27;s height, and additional green lower stripe covering one-third. An additional vertical red-on-white traditional Belarusian decorative pattern, which occupies one-ninth of the flag&#x27;s length, is placed against the flagstaff. The flag&#x27;s ratio of width to length is 1:2.
The flag does not differ significantly from the flag of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (Byelorussian SSR), other than the removal of the hammer and sickle and the red star, as well as the reversal of red and white in the hoist pattern, from white-on-red to red-on-white. While there is no official interpretation for the colours of the flag, an explanation given by President Alexander Lukashenko is that red represents freedom and the sacrifice of the nation&#x27;s forefathers, while green represents life.

In addition to the 1995 decree, &quot;STB 911-2008: National Flag of the Republic of Belarus&quot; was published by the State Committee for Standardisation of the Republic of Belarus in 2008. It gives the technical specifications of the national flag, such as the details of the colours and the ornament pattern. The red ornament design on the national flag was, until 2012, the width of the flag, and with the white margin. As of 2012, the red pattern has occupied the whole of the white margin (which stayed at ).

===Colours===
The colours of the national flag are regulated in &quot;STB 911-2008: National Flag of the Republic of Belarus&quot; and are listed in the CIE Standard illuminant D65.


=== Construction sheet ===
===Hoist ornament pattern===

A decorative pattern, designed in 1917 by , is displayed on the hoist of the flag (as it was previously, on the 1951 flag). The pattern, derived from local plants and flowers, is a traditional type commonly used in Belarus. These patterns are sometimes used in woven garments, most importantly in the traditional &quot;ruchnik&quot;, a woven cloth used for ceremonial events such as religious services, weddings, and other more minor social functions, such as a host offering guests bread and salt served on a ručnik.

The husband of Matrona Markevich was arrested for anti-Soviet propaganda and executed during Soviet repression in Belarus in 1937, after which the family was dekulakised. The original &quot;ruchnik&quot; has not survived and was either confiscated by the NKVD in 1937 or destroyed during World War II. The brother of Matrona Markevich, Mikhail Katsar, head of the ethnography and folklore department at the Academy of Sciences of Belarus, was included into the commission that was ordered to create a new flag for the Belarusian SSR in 1951. A monument to Matrona Markevich was erected in Sianno in 2015.

==Protocol==

Belarusian law requires that the flag be flown daily, weather permitting, from the following locations:
* The residence of the president of Belarus
* The buildings of the National Assembly of Belarus (House of Representatives and Council of the Republic)
* The building of the Council of Ministers of Belarus
* Courts of Belarus 
* Offices of local executive and administrative bodies
* Above buildings in which sessions of local Councils of deputies take place (during the meetings)
* Military bases or military ships
* Belarusian embassies and consulates
* At checkpoints and posts at the borders of Belarus

The Belarusian flag is also officially flown on the sites of special occasions:
* Sessions of local executive and administrative bodies
* Voting/polling places
* Sports arenas during competitions (although the IOC has its own rules on flag display)

Belarusian diplomats and various government officials (such as the President and the Prime Minister) display the flag on vehicles. On special occasions, such as memorial services and family holidays, and it can be used at ceremonies and events hosted by public organisations, companies, and NGOs. The regulations were issued in the same decree that defined the Belarusian flag. The national flag has been incorporated into the badge of the guard units in the Belarusian armed forces. The pole should be three times longer than the width of the flag.

According to the 1995 presidential decree, the national flag is to be used on a staff that is coloured gold (ochre). Other parts of the protocol specify the finial (the metal ornament on a flag pole) as diamond-shaped and coloured in a yellow metal. In this diamond there is a five-pointed star (similar to that used in the national emblem). The diamond pattern represents another continuation of Soviet flag traditions. The Day of the National Emblem and Flag of Belarus is 15 May.

==Historical flags==
=== White-red-white flag ===

The white-red-white flag was used by the Belarusian People&#x27;s Republic in 1918 before Belarus became a Soviet Republic, then by the Belarusian national movement in West Belarus followed by widespread unofficial use during the Nazi occupation of Belarus between 1942 and 1944, and again after it regained its independence in 1991 until the 1995 referendum. 

Opposition groups have continued to use this flag, though its display in Belarus has been restricted by the government of Belarus, which claims it is linked with Nazi collaboration due to its use by Belarusian collaborators during World War II. The white-red-white flag has been used in protests against the government, most recently the 2020–2021 Belarusian protests, and by the Belarusian diaspora.

=== Soviet era ===
====1919–1951====
Before 1951, several different flags had been in use since the Revolution. The earliest flag was plain red, and was used in 1919 during the existence of the Lithuanian–Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. After the formation of the Byelorussian SSR, the lettering ССРБ (SSRB) was added in gold to the top hoist. This design was established with the passage of the first Constitution of the Byelorussian SSR. It was later modified in the 1927 Constitution where the letters were changed to БССР (BSSR) but kept the overall design the same. This design was changed in 1937, when a hammer and sickle and red star were placed above the letters. The flag dimensions were also formally established as 1:2 for the first time. This flag remained in use until the adoption of the 1951 flag, which did away with the letters.
====1951–1991====
The flag of the Byelorussian SSR was adopted by decree on 25 December 1951. The flag was slightly modified in 1956 when construction details were added for the red star and the golden hammer and sickle. The final specifications of the flag was set in Article 120 of the Constitution of the Byelorussian SSR and are very similar to the current Belarusian flag. The flag had a length-to-width ratio of one to two (1:2), just like the flag of the Soviet Union (and the other fourteen union republics). The main portion of the flag was red (representing the Revolution), with the rest being green (representing the Belarusian forests). A pattern of white drawn on red decorated the hoist portion of the flag; this design is often used on Belarusian traditional costumes. In the upper corner of the flag, in the red portion, a gold hammer and sickle was added, with a red star outlined in gold above it. The hammer represented the worker, and the sickle the peasant; according to Soviet ideology, these two symbols crossed together symbolised co-operation between the two classes. The red star, a symbol commonly used by Communist parties, was said to stand either for the five social groups (workers, youth, peasants, military, and academics), the five known continents, or the five fingers of the worker&#x27;s hand. The hammer, sickle and star were sometimes not displayed on the reverse of the flag. The purpose for this design was that the Byelorussian SSR, along with the Soviet Union and the Ukrainian SSR, were admitted to the United Nations in 1945 as founding members and needed distinct flags for each other. The designer of the flag was Mikhail Gusyev.

===1995 referendum===

The referendum that was held to adopt the state symbols took place on 14 May 1995. With a voter turnout of 64.7%, the new flag was approved by a majority in the ratio of three to one (75.1% to 24.9%). The other three questions were also passed by the voters. The way of carrying out the referendum as well as the legality of questioning the national symbols on a referendum was heavily criticised by the opposition. Opposition parties claimed that only 48.7% of the entire voting population (75.1% of the 64.7% who showed at the polling stations) supported the adoption of the new flag, but Belarusian law (as in many other countries) states that only a majority of voters is needed to decide on a referendum issue. Upon the results going in favor of President Lukashenko, he proclaimed that the return of the Soviet-style flag brought a sense of youth and pleasant memories to the nation.

Lukashenko had tried to hold a similar referendum before, in 1993, but failed to get parliamentary support. Two months before the May 1995 referendum, Lukashenko proposed a flag design that consisted of two small bars of green and one wide bar of red. While it is not known what became of this suggestion, new designs (called &quot;projects&quot; in Belarus) were suggested a few days later, which were then put up to vote in the 1995 referendum.

==Other related flags==
Since the introduction of the 1995 flag, several other flags adopted by government agencies or bodies have been modelled on it.

The presidential standard, which has been in use since 1997, was adopted by a decree called &quot;Concerning the Standard of the President of Republic of Belarus&quot;. The standard&#x27;s design is an exact copy of the national flag, with the addition of the Belarusian national emblem in gold and red. The standard&#x27;s ratio of 5:6 differs from that of the national flag, making the standard almost square. It is used at buildings and on vehicles to denote the presence of the president.

In 2001, President Lukashenko issued a decree granting a flag to the Armed Forces of Belarus. The flag, which has a ratio of 1:1.7, has the national ornamental pattern along the length of the hoist side of the flag. On the front of the flag is the Belarusian coat of arms, with the wording УЗБРОЕНЫЯ СІЛЫ (&quot;Armed Forces&quot;) arched over it, and РЭСПУБЛІКІ БЕЛАРУСЬ (&quot;of Republic of Belarus&quot;) written below; the text of both is in gold. On the reverse of the flag, the centre contains the symbol of the armed forces, which is a red star surrounded by a wreath of oak and laurel. Above the symbol is the phrase ЗА НАШУ РАДЗІМУ (&quot;For our Motherland&quot;), while below is the full name of the military unit.

<text>Marsworth is a village and a civil parish within the unitary authority area of Buckinghamshire, England. It is about north of Tring, Hertfordshire and east of Aylesbury.

==Early history==
The village name is Anglo Saxon in origin, &quot;Mæssanwyrth&quot;, and means &#x27;Mæssa&#x27;s enclosure&#x27;. Marsworth is first mentioned in the will of Aelfgyfu (before 975) as granted to Edgar of England who in turn passed it to St Etheldreda&#x27;s Church in London (belonging to the Bishops of Ely), and later passed into the hands of Brictric, a thegn of Edward the Confessor. After the Norman Conquest Marsworth (&quot;Missevorde&quot;) is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as being in the possession of Robert D&#x27;Oyly and was connected to Wallingford, an association which continued into the 17th century. The tenants at this time were the Bassett family and the land was split between six sisters, and through their line the estates passed to the Goldingtons, at which time the manor becomes recorded as Marsworth with Goldringtons.

By 1319 records show there were still several overlords controlling various parts of Marsworth including a descendant of Isabel Bassett, John de Beauchamp Lord of the Manor at Hawridge. This is the first indication of a tie-up between Marsworth and the detached manor or Hawridge, possibly to provide woodland and hilltop summer pasture for the estate across the narrow isthmus of Hertfordshire.

There were connections between another estate in Marsworth and the Savoy Hospital in London, to which the Boughton family granted lands in 1514 in the honour of Henry III. It subsequently became an endowment for St Thomas&#x27; Hospital and in 1876 was swapped for lands in Essex by William Brown of Tring.

There are records of a church in Marsworth since the 12th century. All Saints&#x27; Church was further extended in the 14th and 15th centuries. Despite further restoration in the first part of the 19th century, by 1880 the church was in a deplorable condition and the newly appointed vicar, the Rev. F. W. Ragg, set about with the help of parishioners to restore it over the next 25 years.

==Marsworth today==

The construction of the Grand Union Canal, which passes through Marsworth brought with it many new business opportunities and the village expanded greatly as a result. Within the parish boundary of Marsworth, to the south of the main village where the canal cross the Lower Icknield Way is the hamlet of Startop&#x27;s End. In 2010 the during building work engineers dug up over 40 bodies in un-marked graves which were subsequently interred in a ceremony conducted by the vicar.
Nearby are three of the four Tring Reservoirs, one of which is named Marsworth reservoir.

<text>The Valley Hunt Club is a private social club and booster organization located in Pasadena, California, that is most noted for starting the Tournament of Roses Parade in 1890.

Its members were former residents of the East and Midwest eager to showcase their new home&#x27;s mild winter weather. &quot;In New York, people are buried in snow&quot;, announced Professor Charles F. Holder at a Club meeting. &quot;Here our flowers are blooming and our oranges are about to bear. Let&#x27;s hold a festival to tell the world about our paradise.&quot;

During the next few years, the festival expanded to include marching bands and motorized floats. The games on the town lot (which was renamed Tournament Park in 1900) included ostrich races, bronco busting demonstrations, football and a race between a camel and an elephant (the elephant won). Reviewing stands were built along the parade route, and Eastern newspapers began to take notice of the event. In 1895, the Tournament of Roses Association was formed to take charge of the festival, which had grown too large for the Valley Hunt Club to handle. After an interregnum of many decades (except for major anniversaries) the club again entered the parade in 1983, and now every year enters an antique carriage, typically a &quot;roof seat break&quot; pulled by friesian horses with outriders.

The Valley Hunt Club continues to be located at 520 South Orange Grove Boulevard, Pasadena, CA 91105, which is the &quot;Formation Area&quot; of each year&#x27;s Rose Parade and near Tournament House. The Valley Hunt Club remains an exclusive private social club. With the exception of the Wrigley Mansion, the current home of the Tournament of Roses Association, the Fenyes Mansion, and the Bissell House, the mansions of midwestern magnates that once stood alongside the Club on Orange Grove Avenue have been replaced by condominium and apartment complexes.

<text>The flag of Belize was adopted on 21 September 1981, the day Belize became independent. It consists of the coat of arms of Belize on a blue field with red stripes at the top and bottom.

British Honduras obtained a coat of arms on 28 January 1907, which formed the basis of the badge used on British ensigns. The coat of arms recalls the logging industry that first led to British settlement there. The figures, tools, and mahogany trees represent this industry. The national motto, &quot;Sub Umbra Floreo&quot;, meaning &quot;Under the Shade I Flourish&quot;, is written in the lower part of the coat of arms.

== Description ==
The flag is royal blue, with a white disc at the centre containing the national coat of arms held by a mestizo and a man of African descent. The flag of Belize is the only country to have humans depicted as a major design element on its national flag, although the flag of Malta contains an image of Saint George on the badge of the George Cross, and the flags of British overseas territories Montserrat and the Virgin Islands, and that of French Polynesia also depict humans.

Several other countries&#x27; flags have human body parts depicted. The flag of Brunei has human hands, and the flags of Uruguay and Argentina both have human facial features depicted in a personified sun.

The flag is bordered at top and bottom by two red stripes. In all, the flag incorporates 19 different colours and shades, making it one of the most colourful national flags in the world.

The colours on the flag are respectively those of the country&#x27;s national parties, the People&#x27;s United Party (PUP), and United Democratic Party (Belize) (UDP). The UDP, established in 1973, had objected to the original blue and white design, those two colours being the PUP&#x27;s representative colours.

The two red stripes at the top and bottom were added to the original design at independence. The coat of arms was granted in 1907. Red stripes were added to denote the colour of the opposition party. The 50 leaves recall 1950, the year PUP came to power.

== History ==
From 1950 onward, an unofficial national flag was in use. It was blue, with the coat of arms on a white disc in the centre (sometimes a blank white circle was used as the coat of arms because it was difficult to draw).

In 1981, Belize gained its independence and a competition was held to design a national flag for the country. The winning submission consisted of the unofficial national flag used by the People&#x27;s United Party with a red border added to all four sides. This was changed to a red border on just the top and bottom before the design was officially adopted. The winning design, which was also known as the &quot;Flag of Unity&quot; was made by two government officials: Everal Waight, Public Secretary, and Inez Sanchez, Chief Education Officer.

A tattered, but mostly intact Belize flag was found by police officers in the ruins of the World Trade Center in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks. The flag was brought to the Embassy of Belize and subsequently returned home to Belize at the request of Prime Minister Said Musa. The flag currently is housed in the Museum of Belize. Belize lost a single citizen in the attacks - Alva Jeffries Sanchez, who was working on the 96th floor of the North Tower when it was impacted by Flight 11.

There were no standardised specifications for the flag of Belize until 2019. The hue of the flag&#x27;s colours, proportions, the shading of the two men, and other elements often varied. In 2019, the National Celebrations Commission started a standardisation process of the flag with consent from both the PUP and the UDP. They planned to have the standardised flags be hoisted on 1 September 2019, the National Flag Day of Belize. There are plans to formalise the standardisation through national legislation.

<text>Meadle is a hamlet in the civil parish of Longwick-cum-Ilmer, in Buckinghamshire, England. It is located to the north of the village of Monks Risborough and near Little Kimble. The current population of Meadle is about 75. Most of the buildings are very old: farmhouses and labourers&#x27; cottages built in traditional red clay brick with thatched roofs. A small stream rises in the village and ultimately joins the Thames.

The earliest recorded mentions of Meadle are in the English Civil War when it was caught up in the battle lines between the Royalists in Oxford and the Parliamentarians in London. A local farm, Armour Farm, is believed to have acquired its name as a store of armaments during the war.

Meadle later became a Quaker settlement; the largest farm in the hamlet is still known as Quaker Farm, where Quakers met and were buried in the orchard behind the house. A local field bears the name of Fox&#x27;s Midsummer after George Fox, the founder of the Quaker movement, who held secret night-time meetings there.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Meadle was a centre of production for the Aylesbury Duck industry, and had a grist mill to provide feed.

Meadle was the home of John Nash, one of England&#x27;s foremost painters and war artists of the inter-war years. He moved there in 1922 and started his great period of landscape water colours, wood engraving and botanical paintings, drawing on the natural scenes and rural activities of the surrounding countryside: the Vale of Aylesbury and the Chiltern Hills. He moved on during the Second World War to settle in East Anglia. The house in which he lived, Lane End, still exists.

Meadle is mostly known to visitors for the Kimble Point-to-Point, a traditional horse-racing event held on nearby fields each Easter Saturday.

<doc id="417891" wikidata="Q19405" url="?curid=417891" title="The Ninth Gate">
<text>The Ninth Gate is a 1999 neo-noir horror thriller film directed, produced, and co-written by Roman Polanski. An international co-production between the United States, Portugal, France, and Spain, the film is loosely based upon Arturo Pérez-Reverte&#x27;s 1993 novel &quot;The Club Dumas&quot;. The film stars Johnny Depp as a dealer of rare books who is tasked with authenticating a 17th-century book that, if used correctly, can summon the Devil.

The premiere showing was at San Sebastián, Spain, on 25 August 1999, a month before the 47th San Sebastian International Film Festival. Though critically and commercially unsuccessful in North America, where reviewers compared it unfavorably with Polanski&#x27;s supernatural film &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; (1968), &quot;The Ninth Gate&quot; earned a worldwide gross of $58.4 million against a $38 million budget. It has since been described as a cult classic.

==Plot==
Dean Corso, a New York City rare book dealer, is hired by wealthy collector Boris Balkan. Balkan has acquired a copy of &quot;The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows&quot;, a book by 17th-century author Aristide de Torchia said to be able to summon the Devil. Torchia is alleged to have written the book in collaboration with the Devil, and only three copies survived when he and his works were burned for heresy. Balkan believes only one of the three is authentic and wants Corso to inspect the other two to determine which one. During his travels, Corso comes into contact with a mysterious woman (&quot;The Girl&quot;) who appears to be following him.

Corso interviews Liana Telfer, the widow of Andrew Telfer who sold Balkan &quot;The Nine Gates&quot; shortly before killing himself. Telfer later seduces Corso, hoping he will sell the book to her. After they have sex, and he refuses to sell, she attacks him, and knocks him unconscious. The next day, Corso goes to a bookseller he had entrusted the book to and finds him hanged in his store like an engraving in &quot;The Nine Gates&quot;. Corso retrieves the book and travels to Toledo, Spain, to speak to the Ceniza Brothers, book restorers who owned Balkan&#x27;s copy before the Telfers. The two show him that, of the book&#x27;s nine engravings, only six are signed &quot;AT&quot;; the other three are signed &quot;LCF&quot; for Lucifer.

Corso travels to Sintra, Lisbon, Portugal, and meets with Victor Fargas who owns a copy of &quot;The Nine Gates&quot;. Corso finds that three different engravings in his copy are signed &quot;LCF&quot;, and the engravings signed this way have subtle differences from those signed &quot;AT&quot;. Corso relays his findings to Balkan and Balkan orders him to acquire Fargas&#x27; copy. The next day the Girl takes Corso to see Fargas, who has been drowned; Corso retrieves Fargas&#x27;s burnt copy from the fireplace and finds the three &quot;LCF&quot; engravings torn out. Corso goes to Paris, France, to investigate the third copy owned by Baroness Kessler. Wary of Corso and knowing he is employed by Balkan, she refuses him. Corso is attacked while walking outside only to be saved by The Girl, who exhibits seemingly supernatural powers. Corso hides Balkan&#x27;s book in his hotel room and tells Kessler about the &quot;LCF&quot; engravings, proposing that each copy has three that together make an authentic set of nine. Intrigued, Kessler allows Corso to look at her copy. Corso is attacked, and the Baroness is strangled to death and her library set on fire. Corso returns to his hotel and discovers Balkan&#x27;s copy is missing, probably stolen by Liana.

The Girl and Corso track Liana to her family&#x27;s ancestral manor where a Satanic cult are conducting a ritual using Balkan&#x27;s book. Balkan interrupts the ceremony, takes his copy back, and strangles Liana to death as the rest of the members run away in fear. Corso abandons the Girl, presuming she was working for Balkan, and pursues Balkan but loses him when his car breaks down. Corso finds a clue in Kessler&#x27;s belongings that directs him to a remote castle, where Balkan is preparing to summon the Devil using the nine &quot;LCF&quot; engravings. He subdues Corso and forces him to watch as he performs the ritual; it apparently works and grants Balkan power and immunity to harm, and he immolates himself to demonstrate and attempt to convince a still skeptical Corso. However, the ritual seemingly fails and Balkan begins to scream in pain from the flames engulfing his body. Corso eventually frees himself, retrieves the engravings and shoots Balkan to end his torment. Sitting in Balkan&#x27;s car, Corso is startled by the Girl, and she kisses him. The two are then shown having passionate sex on the ground while backlit by the burning castle. The Girl&#x27;s face and eyes seem to change as she writhes astride Corso in a state of crazed bliss.

After, as the two are traveling, the Girl explains Balkan&#x27;s ritual did not work because the ninth engraving was forged. When they stop for gasoline she vanishes, but leaves Corso a note sending him to the Ceniza brothers. At their shop, Corso finds they have vanished and the shop is being cleaned out. As workmen remove a large bookcase, a dust-covered paper floats down from the top. This is the authentic engraving, which depicts a woman who resembles the Girl riding atop a dragon-like beast in front of the castle at dawn. Corso, now with all nine authentic engravings in his possession, returns to the castle. The gates open on their own and emit a powerful bright light as Corso walks through, taking the journey through the Ninth Gate.

==Cast==
==Production==

Roman Polanski read the screenplay by Enrique Urbizu, an adaptation of the Spanish novel &quot;El Club Dumas&quot; (&quot;The Club Dumas&quot;, 1993), by Arturo Pérez-Reverte. Impressed with the script, Polanski read the novel, liking it because he &quot;saw so many elements that seemed good for a movie. It was suspenseful, funny, and there were a great number of secondary characters that are tremendously cinematic&quot;. Pérez-Reverte&#x27;s novel, &quot;El Club Dumas&quot; features intertwined plots, so Polanski wrote his own adaptation with his usual partner, John Brownjohn (&quot;Tess&quot;, &quot;Pirates&quot; and &quot;Bitter Moon&quot;). They deleted the novel&#x27;s literary references and a sub-plot about Dean Corso&#x27;s investigation of an original manuscript of a chapter of &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;, and concentrated upon Corso&#x27;s pursuing the authentic copy of &quot;The Nine Gates&quot;.

Polanski approached the subject skeptically, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe in the occult. I don&#x27;t believe. Period.&quot; Yet he enjoyed the genre. &quot;There [are] a great number of clichés of this type in &quot;The Ninth Gate&quot;, which I tried to turn around a bit. You can make them appear serious on the surface, but you cannot help but laugh at them.&quot; The appeal of the film was that it featured &quot;a mystery in which a book is the leading character&quot; and its engravings &quot;are also essential clues&quot;.

In reading &quot;El Club Dumas&quot;, Polanski pictured Johnny Depp as &quot;Dean Corso&quot;, who joined the production as early as 1997, when he met Polanski at the Cannes Film Festival, while promoting &quot;The Brave&quot;. Initially, he did not think Depp right as &quot;Corso&quot;, because the character was forty years old (Depp at the time was only 34). He considered an older actor, but Depp persisted; he wanted to work with Roman Polanski.

The film press reported, around the time of the North American release of &quot;The Ninth Gate&quot;, creative friction between Depp and Polanski. Depp said, &quot;It&#x27;s the director&#x27;s job to push, to provoke things out of an actor&quot;. Polanski said of Depp, &quot;He decided to play it rather flat, which wasn&#x27;t how I envisioned it; and I didn&#x27;t tell him it wasn&#x27;t how I saw it&quot;. Visually, in the neo-noir genre style, rare-book dealer Dean Corso&#x27;s disheveled grooming derives from Philip Marlowe, Raymond Chandler&#x27;s quintessential literary private investigator.

Polanski cast Frank Langella as Boris Balkan based upon his performance as Clare Quilty in &quot;Lolita&quot; (1997). Barbara Jefford was a last-minute replacement for the German actress originally cast as the Baroness Frieda Kessler, who fell sick with pneumonia, and after a second actress proved unable to learn the character&#x27;s dialogue; with only days&#x27; notice, Jefford learned her part, spoken with a German accent. Depp met his long-time partner Vanessa Paradis during the shooting.

===Filming===
&quot;The Ninth Gate&quot; was filmed in France, Portugal, and Spain in the summer of 1998. Selected prominent buildings in the film are:
* Biester Palace, Sintra, Portugal (as mansion of book collector Victor Fargas)
* Château de Ferrières, Seine-et-Marne, France (as mansion owned by Liana Telfer)
* Château de Puivert, Aude, France (castle seen in the closing scenes of the film)
* Calle Buzones in Toledo, Spain (street with Ceniza Brothers&#x27; bookshop)

==Soundtrack==
The musical score for &quot;The Ninth Gate&quot; was composed by Wojciech Kilar, who previously collaborated with Polanski on &quot;Death and the Maiden&quot; (1994). The film&#x27;s main theme is loosely based upon Havanaise, for violin and orchestra, by Camille Saint-Saëns; some of the score has a vocalization (specifically, a melodic aria) by Korean soprano Sumi Jo. A soundtrack album was released on 16 November 1999 via Silva Screen label.

== Release and reception ==
=== Box office ===
The premiere screening of &quot;The Ninth Gate&quot; was in San Sebastián, Spain, on 25 August 1999; in North America, it appeared in 1,586 cinemas during the 10 March 2000 weekend, earning a gross income of $6.6 million, and $18.6 million in total. Worldwide, it earned $58.4 million against a $38 million production budget.
On May 22, 2007, an extended version was released with a runtime of 2 hours and 13 minutes.

=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 43% based on reviews from 95 critics, with an average rating of 5/10. The consensus reads, &quot;Even though the film is stylish and atmospheric, critics say &quot;The Ninth Gate&quot; meanders aimlessly and is often ludicrous. And despite the advertising, there&#x27;s hardly any chills.&quot; On Metacritic it has a score of 44 out of 100 based on reviews from 30 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;D−&quot; on scale of A to F.

Roger Ebert said the ending was lackluster: &quot;while at the end, I didn&#x27;t yearn for spectacular special effects, I did wish for spectacular information — something awesome, not just a fade-to-white&quot;. In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Elvis Mitchell said the movie was &quot;about as scary as a sock-puppet re-enactment of &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;, and not nearly as funny&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; rated the film &quot;D+&quot;, and Lisa Schwarzbaum said it had an &quot;aroma of middle-brow, art-house Euro-rot, a whiff of decay and &quot;hauteur&quot; in a film not even a star as foxed, and foxy, as Johnny Depp, himself, could save&quot;. In the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Kenneth Turan said the film was &quot;too laid-back, and unconcerned about the pacing of its story to be satisfying&quot;, because &quot;while a thriller that&#x27;s not high-powered, is an intriguing concept, in reality it can hold our attention for only so long&quot;. In the &quot;Village Voice&quot;, J. Hoberman said the film was &quot;barely releasable hokum, stuffed with cheesy blah-blah&quot;. European reviews were generally more attentive and praised the film&#x27;s pace and irony.

In &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; magazine, Phillip Strick said it was &quot;not particularly liked at first outing — partly because Johnny Depp, in fake grey temples, personifies the odious Corso of the book a little too accurately — the film is intricately well-made, deserves a second chance, despite its disintegrations, and, in time, will undoubtedly acquire its own coven of heretical fans&quot;.

In &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Richard Corliss said that &quot;The Ninth Gate&quot; was Polanski&#x27;s most accessible effort &quot;since fleeing the U.S. soon after &quot;Chinatown&quot;&quot;.

In the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, Bob Graham said that &quot;Depp is the best reason to see Polanski&#x27;s satanic thriller&quot; and &quot;Polanski&#x27;s sly sense of &quot;film-noir&quot; conventions pokes fun at the genre, while, at the same time, honoring it&quot;.

After the release of &quot;The Ninth Gate&quot;, Artisan sued Polanski for taking more than $1 million from the budget, refunds of France&#x27;s value-added tax that he did not give to the completion bond company guaranteeing Artisan Entertainment a completed film.

<text>The national flag of Benin () is a flag consisting of two horizontal yellow and red bands on the fly side and a green vertical band at the hoist. Adopted in 1959 to replace the French Tricolour, it was the flag of the Republic of Dahomey until 1975, when the People&#x27;s Republic of Benin was established. The new regime renamed the country and changed the flag to a green field with a red star in the canton. This version was utilized until multi-party democracy was re-established in 1990, coinciding with the Revolutions of 1989. The new government promptly restored the original pre-1975 flag.
==History==
Under French colonial rule over Dahomey, French authorities forbade the colony from having its own regional flag. This was because they were worried that this could increase nationalistic sentiment and lead to calls for independence. However, with the rise of the decolonization movement in Africa, the French were obliged to grant limited autonomy to Dahomey as a self-governing republic within the French Community. This was granted on December 4, 1958, and a search for a national flag began soon after.

The new flag was chosen on November 16, 1959, and remained unchanged when Dahomey became independent less than a year later on August 1, 1960. In 1972, a coup d&#x27;état took place in the country, with the new government aligning itself with Marxist–Leninist ideals. In order to symbolize the revolutionary change, the country was renamed Benin and a new flag was instituted three years later. It featured a green field charged with a five-pointed red star in the top-left canton. The new flag was never adopted by law, however, making it only the &quot;de facto&quot; flag of Benin.

The green flag remained in place until 1990, when economic problems and the weakening of the Soviet Union&#x27;s power due to the Revolutions of 1989 culminated in the collapse of the People&#x27;s Republic of Benin. The original flag from 1959 was reinstated on August 1, 1990.

==Design==
The colours of the flag carry cultural, political, and regional meanings. As stated in the national anthem, the green of the flag represent the hope of a new democracy. The red represents the courage of the ancestors, and the yellow is for the treasures of the nation. On a continental level, the yellow, green and red represented the Pan-Africanist movement; the three colours were utilized by the African Democratic Rally, a political party representing the interests of French West Africa in the National Assembly of France at the time of decolonization. Furthermore, the colours are the same as the ones utilized in the flag of Ethiopia. This honours the oldest independent country in Africa and the only nation other than Liberia to remain independent during the Scramble for Africa.

<text>SystemRescue (Previously known as &quot;SystemRescueCD&quot;) is a Linux distribution for x86-64 and IA-32 computers. The primary purpose of SystemRescue is to repair unbootable or otherwise damaged computer systems after a system crash. SystemRescue is not intended to be used as a permanent operating system. It runs from a Live CD, a USB flash drive or any type of hard drive. It was designed by a team led by François Dupoux, and is based on Arch Linux since version 6.0. Starting with version 6.0, it has systemd as its init system.

== Requirements ==
For more recent versions, a 64-bit processor is required, with 32-bit processors being deprecated after version 9.03 in 2017. PowerPC had a single release with version 0.2.0 in 2004, with SPARC also having one for version 0.4.0 in 2007.

If a PXE boot requires HTTP or TFTP, at least 1GB of memory will be needed for loading a required file for those into memory. However if NFS or NBD is used, the 1GB requirement isn&#x27;t necessary. Running the live cd from memory is recommended for speed and not requiring the boot device to be connected after boot, however it does require installed memory to be at least 2GB. Bootable USBs have become preferred over CDs or DVDs due to the more recent size increases of the distribution and due to the lack of optical drives in many modern devices.

==Features==
SystemRescue is capable of graphics using the Linux framebuffer option for tools such as GParted. It has options such as connecting to the Internet through an ADSL modem or Ethernet and graphical web browsers such as Mozilla Firefox.

The File systems supported by System-Rescue are btrfs, ext3, ext4, FAT16, FAT32, ISO9660, JFS, NTFS, ReiserFS, VFAT, and XFS

There are two bootloaders supporting the OS – GRUB &amp; SYSLINUX.

SystemRescue features include:

=== System tools ===
* Cryptsetup – software to encrypt and decrypt disks, supports the LUKS format.
* Disk Partitioning and management – GNU Parted and GParted (supports MBR and GPT)
* File system tools – btrfs-progs (btrfs), dosfstools (FAT family), e2fsprogs (ext2/ext3/ext4), NTFS-3G (NTFS)
* lvm – used for Logical Volume Management for accessing, modifying and deleting logical volumes.
* nvme-cli – used for NVMe SSD management
* nwipe – a secure data erasure tool (fork of DBAN) for hard drives to remove data remanence, supports Gutmann method plus other overwriting standard algorithms and patterns.
* Partition tables and disk management – fdisk, gdisk, cfdisk
* smartmontools – a S.M.A.R.T. suite for drive health reporting and data loss prevention

* Supports the use of Virtual Private Networks (using OpenVPN, Wireguard, OpenConnect) 
* TestDisk – A tool to check, recover and repair partitions

=== Applications ===
* Anti-virus – ClamAV.
* Archives – Tar and p7zip (both provide support for gzip, xz, zstd, lz4, bzip2 formats), FSArchiver (compressed archives from file system content)
* CD/DVD burner – dvd+rw-tools, udftools
* Data Recovery software – Chntpw (Windows password reset),ddrescue (data recovery on damaged drives and listing damaged sectors), PartImage (disk imaging for used sectors), Photorec (media, documents and archive recovery)
* File managers – emelFM2, Midnight Commander, Thunar (uses XFCE desktop environment)
* Hex editors – hexedit (in terminal), ghex (GUI)
* FTP Clients – Lftp (ran from terminal)
* Password Manager – KeePassXC
* PGP Suite – GNU Privacy Guard
* SSH Client – OpenSSH
* Remote Access Tools – Remmina, rdekstop (for windows systems).
* Syncing and backups – Rsync (text-based), grsync (GUI), rclone.
* Serial console – Supports using Screen, Minicom and Picocom for networking via a serial interface.
* Text editors – vim, nano, qemacs and joe are text-based, while featherpad and geany have a GUI
* Web browsers – For a graphical browser Firefox is included, and for a text-based browser ELinks is included

=== Programming ===
* It uses the built-in Bash shell for commands and scripting.
* It also supports Perl, Python and Ruby for scripting or programming.

Additionally, the live cd also allows for booting to FreeDOS, Memtest86+, hardware diagnostics and the ability to create other boot disks from a single CD

==Burning CDs/DVDs and creating a bootable USB==
The live cd iso file being installed needs to match the system being used; for 64-bit x86-64 processors amd64 is used, for 32-bit IA-32 processors i686 is used. The supported architecture is listed at the end of the iso filename.

The CD can also boot from a customized DVD which has almost 4.6 GB of free space for backed-up files. This makes it good for storing all the information that is needed from a hard drive and then formatting it. To burn the DVD, one must burn the image file first and then add all the separate files and folders. This should not affect the general way in which the DVD works. The DVD can then be used to insert those files into the hard drive using Midnight Commander.

The system-rescue iso can be used to create a bootable USB device using tools such as rufus, ventoy, or the dedicated linux tool. The USB must have at least 2GB of storage and be formatted in FAT32.

<text>The flag of the British Overseas Territory of Bermuda as a red ensign was first adopted on 4 October 1910. It is a British Red Ensign with the Union Flag (which is the national flag) in the upper left corner, and the coat of arms of Bermuda in the lower right. Prior to this like most of the British colonies at the time it adopted a blue ensign with a seal that depicted a dry dock with three sailing ships. In 1999, the flag was changed to its current form, with an enlarged coat of arms.

==Description==
The flag is unusual for a British overseas territory in that it is used on land in a red ensign form; most other British overseas territories use a version of the blue ensign for general use ashore. Bermuda&#x27;s use of a red ensign on land is in keeping with Canada (pre-1965) and the Union of South Africa (pre-1928), both of which used red ensigns ashore as local flags in the early part of the 20th century. Bermuda&#x27;s flag is an appropriate civil ensign for vessels registered on the Bermuda portion of the British Register, by virtue of the Bermuda Merchant Shipping Act of 2002. The Governor of Bermuda uses a Union Flag defaced with the coat of arms, a design traditional for Governors of the British overseas territories. For the state ensign, a blue ensign is used.

==Coat of arms==
The Latin inscription on the coat of arms reads &quot;Quo Fata Ferunt&quot; (&quot;Whither the Fates Carry&quot;). The coat of arms shows a lion holding a shield which bears a picture of a shipwreck on a rock.

<text>The national flag of Bhutan () is one of the national symbols of Bhutan. The flag features the Druk, a dragon from Bhutanese mythology. This alludes to the country&#x27;s name in , meaning &#x27;The Thunder Dragon Kingdom&#x27;, as well as the Drukpa Lineage of Tibetan Buddhism—the dominant religion of Bhutan.

The basic design of the flag by Mayum Choying Wangmo Dorji dates to 1947. A version was displayed in 1949 at the signing of the Indo-Bhutan Treaty. A second version was introduced in 1956 for the visit of Druk Gyalpo Jigme Dorji Wangchuck to eastern Bhutan; it was based upon photos of its 1949 predecessor and featured a white Druk in place of the green original. Dasho Shingkhar Lam Kuenzang Wangchuk, the secretary to the third king Jigme Dorji Wangchuck, was asked to redesign the flag. He is responsible for the current design, which remained unchanged since 1969. It was to match the measurements of the flag of India, which they believed fluttered better than their own. Other modifications such as changing the red background colour to orange led to the current design, in use since 1969. The National Assembly of Bhutan codified a code of conduct in 1972 to formalize the flag&#x27;s design and establish protocol regarding acceptable flag sizes and conditions for flying the flag.

==Current national flag==
===Design===
The current flag is divided diagonally from the lower hoist-side corner, with the upper triangle yellow and the lower triangle orange. Centred along the dividing line is a large black and white dragon facing away from the hoist side. The dragon is holding a &quot;norbu&quot;, or jewel, in each of its claws. The background colours of the flag, yellow and orange, are identified as Pantone 116 and 165 respectively. Equivalents of these shades and the white of the Druk are specified by various other codes according to particular matching systems as indicated below.

The dimensions of the flag must maintain a 3:2 ratio. The following sizes have been declared standard by the Government of Bhutan:
* 
* 
* , for car flags.

===Symbolism===

According to &quot;The Legal Provisions of the National Flag of the Kingdom of Palden Drukpa as Endorsed in Resolution 28 of the 36th Session of the National Assembly held on 8 June 1972&quot;, and as restated in the Constitution of 2008, the yellow signifies civil tradition and temporal authority as embodied in the &quot;Druk Gyalpo&quot;, the Dragon King of Bhutan, whose royal garb traditionally includes a yellow kabney (scarf). The orange half signifies Buddhist spiritual tradition, particularly the Drukpa Kagyu and Nyingma schools. The dragon spreads equally over the line between the colours. Its placement in the centre of the flag over the dividing line between the flag&#x27;s two colours signifies the equal importance of both civic and monastic traditions in the Kingdom of Druk (Bhutan) and evokes the strength of the sacred bond between sovereign and people. The dragon&#x27;s white colour signifies the purity of inner thoughts and deeds that unite all the ethnically and linguistically diverse peoples of Bhutan. The jewels held in Druk&#x27;s claws represent Bhutan&#x27;s wealth and the security and protection of its people, while the dragon&#x27;s snarling mouth symbolizes Bhutanese deities&#x27; commitment to the defense of Bhutan.

==Historic evolution==
The Centre for Bhutan Studies and GNH Research, an independent Bhutanese research centre, in 2002 issued a paper (henceforth the &quot;CBS document&quot;) that is the only readily available account from Bhutan of the historical development of the national flag. The document draws heavily on first-hand accounts obtained through interviews with individuals personally involved in the creation and modification of the flag in Bhutan, from the late 1940s until the adoption of the current flag around 1970. This report is therefore a significant primary source for information about the history of the Bhutanese flag. But in the description of the flag from 1949, the document is not in complete accord with photos of the flag (as discussed below), making it difficult to interpret some of the document&#x27;s assertions. As a record, however, of the few primary sources remaining – namely, the people involved in the flag&#x27;s history and the handful of existing government records – it represents a valuable source of information about the otherwise poorly documented evolution of the Bhutanese flag.

===First national flag (1949)===
The CBS document states that the first national flag was designed upon the request of Jigme Wangchuck, the second Druk Gyalpo of the 20th-century Kingdom of Bhutan, and was introduced in 1949 during the signing of the Indo-Bhutan Treaty. While the document does not provide an illustration of the original design, black-and-white photographs taken at this historic event provide images of the first Bhutanese flag at the ceremony.

The design of the flag is credited to Mayum Choying Wangmo Dorji in 1947. Lharip Taw Taw, one of the few painters available to the royal court at the time, is said to have embroidered the flag. Druk was coloured green in accordance with traditional and religious references to &quot;yu druk ngon ma&quot; (), or &quot;turquoise druk&quot;. Today, a modern reproduction of this historic original (with several significant changes influenced by the modern flag) is displayed behind the throne in the National Assembly Hall in Thimphu.

According to the CBS document, the original Bhutanese flag was a bicolour square flag divided diagonally from the lower hoist to the upper fly. The field of yellow extended from the hoist to the upper fly, and the red field extended from the fly end to the lower hoist. In the centre of the flag, at the convergence of the yellow and red fields, is a green Druk, located parallel to the bottom edge and facing the fly.

However, the CBS document does not illustrate the early versions of the flag and its description of the 1949 flag is not entirely consistent with the photos surviving from 1949. It describes the flag as &quot;square&quot;, while the proportions of the flag in the photographs appear closer to 4:5. The document describes the dragon as &quot;facing the fly end&quot;, while the dragon visible in the photos faces the hoist. The dragon is described as &quot;parallel to the fly&quot; (meaning, according to a diagram in the document, parallel to the length along the bottom edge of the flag), while the dragon in the photos appears to have a slightly rising vertical slant. The dragon is described as &quot;green&quot;, but the shade in the photos, if indeed green, must be very pale.

Western flag books until after 1970 generally show the Bhutanese flag closely resembling the 1949 photos.

===Changes in 1956===
The second version of the national flag was developed in 1956 for the visit of the third Druk Gyalpo Jigme Dorji Wangchuk to eastern Bhutan. During the trip, the Druk Gyalpo&#x27;s Secretariat began to use flags of a new design based upon a photograph of the first national flag of 1949, with the colour of the dragon changed from green to white. The retinue of the Druk Gyalpo included a convoy consisting of over one hundred ponies; a small version of the flag was placed on the saddle of every tenth pony, and a large flag approximately in size was flown in the camp every evening, hoisted to the sound of a bugle.

===Changes after 1956===

Beginning in the late 1950s, Dasho Shingkhar Lam, former Secretary to His Majesty King Jigme Dorji Wangchuck and Sixth Speaker of the National Assembly (1971–74), was requested by the king to make several modifications to the flag; he is responsible for its current design, which has remained unchanged since 1969. The king was reportedly dissatisfied that the early square Bhutanese flags did not flutter like the rectangular Indian flag displayed on the visit of an Indian official to the country. The standard measurements of the flag of Bhutan were thereafter altered to resemble the flag of India, which was 9 feet by 6 feet.

In another change, the dragon, which had formerly been placed in a roughly horizontal position in the centre of the flag, was repositioned to spread out over the diagonal dividing line between the background colours. This change sought to avoid having the dragon &quot;face the earth&quot; when the flag was hanging limp. Bhutanese artist Kilkhor Lopen Jada painted a new design for the druk in which the curves of the dragon&#x27;s body are relaxed to create a somewhat longer and more gently undulating shape.

The CBS document states that the king ordered the colour of the lower half changed from red to orange &quot;sometime in 1968 or 69.&quot;

The Bhutanese flag was flown abroad beside another nation&#x27;s flag for the first time in 1961 during a state visit to India by Jigme Dorji Wangchuck. This visit inaugurated a new level of relations between the two countries.

==Code of conduct==
On 8 June 1972, the National Assembly of Bhutan approved Resolution 28, bringing into effect National Flag Rules drafted by the Cabinet. The rules have eight provisions covering the description and symbolism of the flag&#x27;s colouring, fields and design elements. Other rules relate to the size of the flag as well as flag protocol including the appropriate places and occasions for flying the flag and who may display the flag on cars. In general, the flag is given as much respect as the Bhutanese state and the head of state. As in the United States Flag Code, no other flags must be placed higher than the Bhutanese flag, the flag cannot be used as a cover or drape (with some exceptions) and the flag must not touch the ground. Other provisions include prohibitions on including the design in other objects or in a logo. Exceptionally, the flag may be used to drape coffins, but only those of high-ranking state officials such as ministers or military personnel.

The 1972 rules also provide that &quot;every dzongkhag [district headquarters] will hoist the national flag. Where there are no dzongkhag, the national flag will be hoisted in front of the office of the main government officer&quot;.

Officials above the rank of minister are allowed to fly the flag at their residence provided they do not live near the capital. The tradition of flying the national flag in front of government offices had not existed in Bhutan prior to 1968 but was decreed standard practice by the Druk Gyalpo after his Secretariat was moved from the city of Taba to Tashichho Dzong in that year. The only flag day prescribed in the 1972 rules is National Day, which is held annually on 17 December. National Day commemorates the crowning of Ugyen Wangchuck as the first king of Bhutan on 17 December 1907.

<text>Orthonectida () is a small phylum of poorly known parasites of marine invertebrates that are among the simplest of multi-cellular organisms. Members of this phylum are known as orthonectids.

==Biology==
The adults, which are the sexual stage, are microscopic wormlike animals, consisting of a single layer of ciliated outer cells surrounding a mass of sex cells. They swim freely within the bodies of their hosts, which include flatworms, polychaete worms, bivalve molluscs, and echinoderms. Most are gonochoristic, with separate male and female individuals, but a few species are hermaphroditic.

When they are ready to reproduce, adults leave the host, and sperm from the males penetrate the bodies of the females to achieve internal fertilisation. The resulting zygote develops into a ciliated larva that escapes from the mother to seek out new hosts. Once it finds a host, the larva loses its cilia and develops into a syncytial plasmodium larva. This, in turn, breaks up into numerous individual cells called agametes (ameiotic generative cells) which grow into the next generation of adults.

==Classification==
The phylum consists of about 20 known species, of which &quot;Rhopalura ophiocomae&quot; is the best-known. The phylum is not divided into classes or orders, and contains just two families.

Although originally described in 1877 as a class, and later characterized as an order of the phylum Mesozoa, a 1996 study has suggested that orthonectids are quite different from the rhombozoans, the other group in Mesozoa. The genome of one orthonectid species, &quot;Intoshia linei&quot;, has been sequenced. These animals are simplified spiralians. The genome data confirm earlier findings which allocated these organisms to Spiralia based on their morphology.

Their position in the spiralian phylogenetic tree has yet to be determined. Some work appears to relate them to the Annelida and, within the Annelida, finds them most closely allied to the Clitellata. On the other hand, a 2022 study compensating for long-branch attraction has recovered the traditional grouping of Orthonectida with rhombozoans in a monophyletic Mesozoa placed close to Platyhelminthes or Gnathifera. This supports a previous study which found orthonectids and rhombozoans to make a monophyletic taxon Mesozoa and form a clade with Rouphozoa (platyhelminths and gastrotrichs).

<doc id="417906" wikidata="Q335845" url="?curid=417906" title="Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon">
<text>Henry Howard Molyneux Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon, (24 June 1831 – 29 June 1890), known as Lord Porchester from 1833 to 1849, was a British politician and a leading member of the Conservative Party. He was twice Secretary of State for the Colonies and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.

==Origins==
Born at Grosvenor Square, London, Carnarvon was the eldest son and heir of Henry Herbert, 3rd Earl of Carnarvon (d.1849), by his wife Henrietta Anna Howard, a daughter of Lord Henry Howard-Molyneux-Howard, younger brother of Bernard Howard, 12th Duke of Norfolk. The Hon. Auberon Herbert was his younger brother.

==Youth==
He was educated at Eton College. In 1849, aged 18, he succeeded his father in the earldom. He attended Christ Church, Oxford, where his nickname was &quot;Twitters&quot;, apparently on account of his nervous tics and twitchy behaviour, and where in 1852 he obtained a first in &quot;literae humaniores&quot;.

== Early political career, 1854–66 ==
Carnavon made his maiden speech in the House of Lords on 31 January 1854, having been requested by Lord Aberdeen to move the address in reply to the Queen&#x27;s Speech. He served under Lord Derby, as Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1858 to 1859, aged twenty-six.

In 1863 he worked on penal reform. Under the influence of Joshua Jebb he saw the gaols, with a population including prisoners before any trial, as numerically more significant than the system of prisons for convicts. He was himself a magistrate, and campaigned for the conditions of confinement to be made less comfortable, with more severe regimes on labour and diet. He also wished to see a national system that was more uniform. In response, he was asked to run a House of Lords committee, which sat from February 1863. It drafted a report, and a Gaol Bill was brought in, during 1864; it was, however, lost amid opposition. The Prisons Act 1866, passed by parliament during 1865, saw Carnarvon&#x27;s main ideas implemented, though with detailed amendments.

== Colonial Secretary and Canadian federation, 1866–7 ==
In 1866 Carnarvon was sworn of the Privy Council and appointed Secretary of State for the Colonies by Derby. In 1867 he introduced the British North America Act, which conferred self-government on Canada, and created a federation. Later that year, he resigned (along with Lord Cranborne and Jonathan Peel) in protest against Benjamin Disraeli&#x27;s Reform Bill to enfranchise the working classes.

== Colonial Secretary, 1874–8 ==
Returning to the office of the British colonial secretary in 1874, he submitted a set of proposals, the Carnarvon terms, to settle the dispute between British Columbia and Canada over the construction of the transcontinental railroad and the Vancouver Island railroad and train bridge. Vancouver Island had been promised a rail link as a condition for its entry into Canadian Confederation.

=== South Africa ===
In the same year, he set in motion plans to impose a system of confederation on the various states of Southern Africa. The situation in southern Africa was complicated, not least in that several of its states were still independent and so required military conquest before being confederated. The confederation plan was also highly unpopular among ordinary southern Africans. The Prime Minister of the Cape Colony (by far the largest and most influential state in southern Africa) firmly rejected confederation under Britain, saying that it was not a model that was applicable to the diverse region, and that conflict would result from outside involvement in southern Africa at a time when state relations were particularly sensitive. The liberal Cape government also objected to the plan for ideological concerns; Its formal response, conveyed to London via Sir Henry Barkly, had been that any federation with the illiberal Boer republics would compromise the rights and franchise of the Cape&#x27;s Black citizens, and was therefore unacceptable. Other regional governments refused even to discuss the idea. Overall, the opinion of the governments of the Cape and its neighbours was that &quot;the proposals for confederation should emanate from the communities to be affected, and not be pressed upon them from outside.&quot;

According to historian Martin Meredith, Lord Carnarvon was primarily concerned with &quot;imperial defence&quot;, and &quot;regarded the Cape and its naval facilities at Simon&#x27;s Bay as being the most important link in the imperial network&quot;. He thus decided to force the pace, &quot;endeavouring to give South Africa not what it wanted, but what he considered it ought to want.&quot; He sent colonial administrators such as Theophilus Shepstone and Henry Bartle Frere to southern Africa to implement his system of confederation. Shepstone occupied and annexed the Transvaal in 1877, while Bartle Frere, as the new High Commissioner, led imperial troops against the last group of independent Xhosa in the Ninth Frontier War. Carnarvon then used the rising unrest to suspend the Natal constitution, while Bartle Frere overthrew the elected Cape government, and then moved to invade the independent Zulu Kingdom.

However the confederation scheme collapsed as predicted, leaving a trail of wars across Southern Africa. Humiliating defeats also followed at Isandlwana and Majuba Hill. Of the resultant wars, the initially disastrous invasion of Zululand ultimately ended in success, but the First Boer War of 1880 had even more far-reaching consequences for the subcontinent. Francis Reginald Statham, editor of &quot;The Natal Witness&quot; in the 1870s, famously summed up the local reaction to Carnarvon&#x27;s plan for the region:

The confederation idea was dropped when Carnarvon resigned in 1878, in opposition to Disraeli&#x27;s policy on the Eastern Question, but the bitter conflicts caused by Carnarvon&#x27;s policy continued, culminating eventually in the Second Boer War and the annexation of the two Boer republics.

== Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, 1885–6 ==
On his party&#x27;s return to power in 1885, Carnarvon became Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. His short period of office, memorable only for a conflict on a question of personal veracity between himself and Charles Stewart Parnell, as to his negotiations with the latter in respect of Home Rule, was terminated by another premature resignation. He never returned to office.
==Other public appointments==
Carnarvon also held the honorary posts of Lord Lieutenant of Hampshire between 1887 and 1890 and Deputy Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire. He was regarded as a highly cultured man and was a president and a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries (his time there noted for their campaign to save St Albans Cathedral from Lord Grimthorpe) and a Fellow of the Royal Society as well as high steward of Oxford University. He was also a prominent freemason, having been initiated in the Westminster and Keystone Lodge. He served as Pro Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of England from 1874 to 1890. With his permission a number of subsequently founded lodges bore his name in their titles.

==Some buildings commissioned by, associated with or overseen by Lord Carnarvon==
Carnarvon became a Freemason in 1856, joining the Westminster and Keystone Lodge, No. 10. In 1860 he was made the second Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Mark Master Masons (created in 1856) and in 1870 he was appointed Deputy Grand Master of the United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE) by Lord Ripon, and was Pro Grand Master from 1874 to 1890. Furthermore, he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1875, confirming, in addition to his work as a statesman, his interest in innovation, geometry, the Enlightenment, science, the Scientific Revolution and the world.
*1855–1878: The Highclere mausoleum or chapel was built for Henrietta Anna, Countess of Carnarvon, in memory of his father and her husband, Henry Herbert, 3rd Earl of Carnarvon. Between 1839 and 1842, his father the third earl had employed Sir Charles Barry to turn the Georgian Highclere house into a Jacobethan castle. The interiors and west wing were carried out by Sir Charles Barry&#x27;s assistant Thomas Allom who also provided the design of the funerary chapel-mausoleum. The entrance hallway-vestibule inside was designed by Sir Gilbert Scott. The work on the house was complete by 1878.
*1869–1870: Church of St Michael and All Angels, Highclere, by Sir Gilbert Scott.
*1870: Concrete Cottages, Long Piddle, Burghclere Bottom, Scouses Corner, Kingsclere or Sydmonton road, Old Burghclere. Rare and early concrete or mass concrete estate housing. The apparatus employed in the construction could have been that patented and manufactured by Messrs. Drake, Brothers, &amp; Reid, of London, in 1868. Designed possibly by Thomas Robjohn Wonnacott or Charles Barry, Jr. (Around the same time, neighbouring landowner Lord Ashburton and his clerk of works Thomas Potter, who wrote &quot;Concrete: its use in building and the construction of concrete walls, floors, etc.&quot;, 1877, built at least one pair of concrete cottages in the Wiltshire villages of All Cannings and Steeple Langford.) Carnarvon had long been thinking about labourers&#x27; cottages and accompanying allotments. The &quot;Reading Mercury&quot; reported the Burghclere project on Saturday, 30 October 1869:
*1874–1881: Villa Altachiara (&quot;Highclere&quot; in Italian) (Villa Carnarvon) near Portofino, Liguria. A massive villa overlooking Portofino. It was still owned by the Herberts when Evelyn Waugh visited in 1936.

==Marriages and issue==
Lord Carnarvon married twice. His first marriage was in 1861 to Lady Evelyn Stanhope (1834–1875), daughter of George Stanhope, 6th Earl of Chesterfield, and Hon. Anne Elizabeth Weld-Forester, by whom he had one son and three daughters:
* Lady Winifred Anne Henrietta Christina Herbert (2 July 1864 – 28 September 1933); married as her second husband Herbert Gardner, 1st Baron Burghclere, and was the mother of Evelyn Gardner, who married the novelist Evelyn Waugh. Evelyn Gardner&#x27;s marriage soon ended in divorce and, despite the opposition of the Herbert family, Waugh remarried to her half first cousin Laura Herbert, a daughter of Aubrey Herbert of Pixton, a son of the 4th Earl by his second wife. 
* George Herbert, 5th Earl of Carnarvon (1866–1923), eldest son and heir, the financial backer of the excavation of the tomb of Tutankhamun;
* Lady Margaret Georgina Eveline Selina Herbert (18 September 1870 – 13 September 1958); married Sir George Herbert Duckworth, a notable civil servant and half-brother of the novelist Virginia Woolf and of the artist Vanessa Bell.

<doc id="417909" wikidata="Q592123" url="?curid=417909" title="Medmenham">
<text>Medmenham () is a village and civil parish in south-west Buckinghamshire, England. It is on the River Thames, about southwest of Marlow and east of Henley-on-Thames. The parish also includes Danesfield, a housing estate predominantly for RAF officers, although families of other ranks from the RAF, Royal Navy and British Army also live there.

==Toponym==
The toponym is derived from the Old English for &quot;middle-sized homestead&quot;. An alternative explanation of the name is from the Saxon leader Meda, whose followers were known as Medings, hence Medin&#x27;ham, Medham, or Medmenham. It was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Medmeham&quot;.

==Features==
The village includes some old timber framed brick and flint cottages and some estate workers cottages built at the beginning of the 20th century from local chalk rock. The Church of England parish church of Saint Peter was heavily restored in 1839. The Dog and Badger Inn on the A4155 road dates from late in the 16th century, the name having been transferred from the inn at Hambleden which was renamed the Stag and Huntsman.

The village lane ends at the Old Ferry crossing which ceased to be used after the Second World War. It was where the Thames towpath crossed from the Buckinghamshire to Berkshire bank of the river. On the towpath beside the former ferry crossing stands the large Medmenham Ferry Memorial that commemorates Lord Devonport&#x27;s successful 1899 defence of the public right-of-way over the ferry.

Next to the village, but separated from it by the A4155, is the first of two Iron Age hill forts, Medmenham Camp. Danesfield Camp also known as Danes Ditches is located slightly further along the road to the east near to the village of Hurley.

Also attached to the village are the hamlets of Lower Woodend and Rockwell End.

==Abbey==
A Cistercian abbey was founded in Medmenham in the 12th century under the ownership of Woburn Abbey, though it was not officially recognised by royal charter until 1200. It was dedicated to St. Mary but closed in 1536. In 1547, at the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the abbey was seized and given to the Moore family and then sold privately to the Duffields. It was while in the possession of the Duffields that the abbey became infamous as the location of The Hellfire Club, headed by Sir Francis Dashwood, formerly called the &quot;Monks of Medmenham&quot; who used it for &quot;obscene parodies of religious rites&quot; according to one source, between the mid 1700s and 1774, though the club was already in disrepute by 1762. During that era, it was renovated to resemble a Gothic building. Eventually, the meetings were moved out of the abbey into a series of tunnels and caves in West Wycombe Hill.

Years later, the West Wycombe Caves in which the &quot;friars&quot; met became a tourist site known as the &quot;Hell Fire Caves&quot;. 

Dashwood had leased the ruins of the abbey from the Duffield family. After the club was defunct (by 1763), the property was sold to the chief justice of Chester. In 1898 the building was modified, and since then it has no longer resembled an abbey. Subsequent renovations were completed in the 20th century.

Today the building is a private residence and is not open to the public. A report in 2015 indicated it had been owned by a German family with a part of the abbey purchased in the 1970s and the rest in the mid 1990s. The property was listed for sale at the time. The report indicated that the 12,000sq ft interior included &quot;nine bedrooms ..., six reception rooms, a gymnasium, a bar, a housekeeper’s cottage and staff offices&quot;. The property has been Grade II listed since 1955. By that time, it had been converted from a mansion into two houses, using some of the masonry from the original Abbey. The summary confirms that the house had been modified in 1755 for Sir Francis Dashwood and restored and extended in 1898.

<text>The Unity of the Brethren is a Protestant church formed in the 1800s by Czech immigrants to Texas, where the church is still based, in the tradition of Moravian Church.

==Restoration in Texas==

From about the middle of the 19th century until the outbreak of the First World War, a number of Czech Protestants immigrated to the United States. In many parts of the U.S. they formed Czech congregations within the Presbyterian Church. Some who settled as farmers in the state of Texas decided to form their own denomination. Jindřich Juren (1850–1921) came to Texas in 1876, and from 1881 to 1888 was the only minister to these Brethren congregations. Representatives of these congregations met in 1903 and formed the Evangelical Unity of the Bohemian-Moravian Brethren in North America. The early churches reflected their origin and worshipped in Czech. By the 1940s, most of the churches reflected assimilation into the surrounding culture and worshipped in English. In 1959, the name Unity of the Brethren was adopted.

===Doctrine===
This body accepts the Apostles&#x27; Creed as a valid expression of their beliefs, and stresses the ancient motto, &quot;In essentials, unity; in non-essentials, liberty; in all things, love.&quot; They believe the Bible is God&#x27;s revelation to man, the sourcebook for all spiritual truth; that one God is revealed in three persons; that Christ is the only way of salvation; that salvation is by grace through faith; that the Holy Spirit dwells in believers; and that Jesus Christ will return to judge the world and reward the faithful believers. The Unity practices two sacraments—water baptism and holy communion. Christian parents present their infant children for baptism. All Christians are invited to commune with them at the Lord&#x27;s supper or communion. However, they do not regard full agreement on the elements, methods and modes of the sacraments as essential. They believe that love is the supreme evidence of Christian disciples.

===Church emblem===
The Unity of the Brethren church has adopted a church emblem having an open Bible, with a cross behind in the center, and a chalice in front to the left. According to the church, the &quot;cross represents Christ as the resurrected and living Lord, the Bible is the sourcebook of all Christian truth, open for all to explore, while the chalice holds special significance for Brethren: not only is it a symbol of the Lord&#x27;s Supper, but it is also a reminder of the pre-Reformation insistence of John Hus and the early Brethren upon receiving wine as well as bread in Holy Communion.&quot;

===Status===
Currently the church is made up of 28 congregations with an estimated membership of 3500, with all except one located in the state of Texas. The location of the majority of churches is roughly the area from West, Temple, to Austin to Houston. The synod meets every two years. The Unity of the Brethren maintains several ministry organizations, including the Board of Christian Education; Brethren Youth Fellowship; Brethren Bookstore, operated in Caldwell, Texas; &quot;Brethren Journal&quot; (founded 1902); Christian Sisters Unity; Friends of the Hus Encampment; Grants and Bequests Board; the Hus Institute for Lay Leadership (which meets with the various congregations); and the Mutual Aid Society. The Hus Encampment Facility is located near Caldwell, Texas. They have no seminary, but support the Moravian Theological Seminary in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Three missionary families are serving in Honduras and Mexico.

<doc id="417914" wikidata="Q17112830" url="?curid=417914" title="Vertical service code">
<text>A vertical service code (VSC) is a sequence of digits and the signals star () and pound/hash () dialed on a telephone keypad or rotary dial to access certain telephone service features. Some vertical service codes require dialing of a telephone number after the code sequence. On a touch tone telephone, the codes are usually initiated with the star key, resulting in the commonly used name &quot;star codes&quot;. On rotary dial telephones, the star is replaced by dialing &quot;11&quot;.

In North American telephony, VSCs were developed by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T) as Custom Local Area Signaling Services (CLASS or LASS) codes in the 1960s and 70s. Their use became ubiquitous throughout the 1990s and eventually became a recognized standard. As &quot;CLASS&quot; was an AT&amp;T trademark, the term &quot;vertical service code&quot; was adopted by the North American Numbering Plan Administration. The use of &quot;vertical&quot; is a somewhat dated reference to older switching methods and the fact that these services can only be accessed by a telephone subscriber, going up (&quot;vertically&quot;) inside the local central office instead of out (&quot;horizontally&quot;) to another telephone company.

==Feature definitions==
The following are the vertical service codes generally recommended by the North American Numbering Plan Administrator for use in the NANP territories. Not all of these services are available in all areas, and some are only available on landline telephones or Mobile phones.

<doc id="417916" wikidata="Q5517204" url="?curid=417916" title="Gain-switching">
<text>Gain-switching is a technique in optics by which a laser can be made to produce pulses of light of extremely short duration, of the order of picoseconds (10−12 s).

In a semiconductor laser, the optical pulses are generated by injecting many carriers (electrons) into the active region of the device, bringing the carrier density within that region from below to above the lasing threshold. When the carrier density exceeds that value, the ensuing stimulated emission results in the generation of many photons. 

However, carriers are depleted as a result of stimulated emission faster than they are injected. So the carrier density eventually falls back to below lasing threshold which results in the termination of the optical output. If carrier injection has not ceased during this period, then the carrier density in the active region can increase once more and the process will repeat itself. 

The figure on the right shows a typical pulse generated by gain-switching with a sinusoidal injection current at 250 MHz producing a pulse of approximately 50 ps. The carrier density is depleted during the pulse, and subsequently rises due to continued current injection, producing a smaller secondary pulse. If the injection current is rapidly switched off at the proper time, for example using a step recovery diode circuit, a single 50 ps light pulse can be generated.

For solid-state and dye lasers, gain switching (or &quot;synchronous pumping&quot;) usually involves the laser gain medium being pumped with another pulsed laser. Since the pump pulses are of short duration, optical gain is only present in the laser for a short time, which results in a pulsed output. Q-switching is more commonly used for producing pulsed output from these types of laser, as pulses with much higher peak power can be achieved.

The term gain-switching derives from the fact that the optical gain is negative when carrier density or pump intensity in the active region of the device is below threshold, and switches to a positive value when carrier density or the pump intensity exceeds the lasing threshold.

<doc id="417917" wikidata="Q2563740" url="?curid=417917" title="The Black Album (Jay-Z album)">
<text>The Black Album is the eighth studio album by American rapper Jay-Z. It was released on November 14, 2003, through Roc-A-Fella Records and Def Jam Recordings. It was advertised as his final album before retiring, which is also a recurring theme throughout the songs, although Jay-Z resumed his recording career in 2005. For the album, Jay-Z wanted to enlist a different producer for each song, working with Just Blaze, Kanye West, the Neptunes, Eminem, DJ Quik, Timbaland, 9th Wonder and Rick Rubin, among others. The album also features a guest appearance by Pharrell Williams.
&quot;The Black Album&quot; was promoted with a retirement tour by Jay-Z. It was also supported by three singles: &quot;99 Problems&quot;, also the &quot;Billboard&quot; top-ten hits &quot;Change Clothes&quot; and &quot;Dirt off Your Shoulder&quot;. The album received widespread acclaim from music critics and was a massive commercial success. It debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 463,000 copies in its first week. It became Jay-Z&#x27;s top selling record of the 2000s decade, and was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2023. The songs &quot;Encore&quot;, &quot;Dirt off Your Shoulder&quot;, and &quot;99 Problems&quot; are all on the mashup EP, &quot;Collision Course&quot; with Linkin Park. In 2004, American musician Danger Mouse released &quot;The Grey Album&quot;, a mashup/remix album which features the vocals of &quot;The Black Album&quot; and the instrumental of The Beatles&#x27; self-titled album, colloquially known as the &quot;White Album&quot;, in which it became controversial at the album&#x27;s release.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;The Black Album&quot; was met with widespread critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, it received an average score of 84, based on 19 reviews. AllMusic&#x27;s John Bush claimed Jay-Z was retiring at his peak with the album. &quot;Vibe&quot; magazine said it was remarkable as an apotheosis of his genuinely thoughtful songwriting and lyrics &quot;delivered with transcendent skill&quot;, while Steve Jones from &quot;USA Today&quot; said even with &quot;top-shelf work&quot; from elite producers, the album was elevated by Jay-Z&#x27;s uniquely deft and diverse rapping style. Writing for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, Nathan Rabin felt Jay-Z returned to &quot;brevity and consistency&quot; on an album that demonstrated his lyrical abilities and, more importantly, hip hop&#x27;s best producers. Jon Caramanica wrote in &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004) that &quot;The Black Album&quot; was both &quot;old-school and utterly modern&quot;, showcasing Jay-Z &quot;at the top of his game, able to reinvent himself as a rap classicist at the right time, as if to cement his place in hip-hop&#x27;s legacy for generations to come&quot;.

Some reviewers were less enthusiastic. In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Touré determined that &quot;The Black Album&quot; was slightly inferior to Jay-Z&#x27;s best records, namely &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot; (1996) and &quot;The Blueprint&quot; (2001). Dave Simpson from &quot;The Guardian&quot; was more critical, dismissing the music as &quot;an aural equivalent of that old American favourite, the schmaltzy biopic.&quot; In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau gave the record a back-handed compliment: &quot;[Jay-Z] raps like a legend in his own time—namely, Elvis in Vegas&quot;. Nonetheless, in a retrospective review in 2011, Christgau stated that he was impressed by the stretch of songs from &quot;Encore&quot; to &quot;Justify My Thug&quot; and thought &quot;the fanfares, ovations, maternal reminiscences, and vamp-till-ready shout-outs were overblown at best&quot; at the time of its release, but they came to sound &quot;prophetic&quot; because of the entrepreneurial success and fame he continued to achieve afterwards. &quot;He&#x27;s got a right to celebrate his autobiography in rhyme because he&#x27;s on track to become a personage who dwarfs any mere rapper,&quot; Christgau wrote, &quot;and not only can he hire the best help dark green can buy, he can make it sing.&quot;

In 2005, &quot;The Black Album&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, losing to Kanye West&#x27;s &quot;The College Dropout&quot; at the 47th Grammy Awards. It was ranked number 349 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2012 edition of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list, and rose to number 155 on the list&#x27;s 2020 edition. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked &quot;The Black Album&quot; at number 90 on its decade-end list of the top 200 albums from the 2000s, while &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; ranked it seventh best on a similar list. In 2012, &quot;Complex&quot; named it one of the &quot;classic&quot; records of the previous decade.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;The Black Album&quot; debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, selling 463,000 copies in its first week, according to Nielsen Soundscan. This became Jay-Z&#x27;s sixth US number one album. Another note on the alter was that the &quot;Black Album&quot; also blocked the to the Tupac Shakur documentary, &quot;&quot;, and the G-Unit debut album, &quot;Beg for Mercy&quot;, from the top position. Both albums charted at numbers two and three respectively. In its second week, the album dropped to number four on the chart, selling an additional 288,000 copies. In its third week, the album climbed to number one on the chart, selling 288,000 more copies. In its fourth week, the album dropped to number ten on the chart, selling 124,000 copies. On August 16, 2005, the album was certified RIAA Certification triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of over three million copies. As of July 2013, the album had sold 3,516,000 copies in the US. According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, it became Jay-Z&#x27;s top selling record of the 2000s and the 136th highest selling record of the decade in the United States.

Three singles were released from the album and appeared on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. &quot;Change Clothes&quot; and &quot;Dirt off Your Shoulder&quot; both reached the top 10 of the Hot 100, while &quot;99 Problems&quot; peaked at number 30.

== Remixes ==
In December 2004, Roc-A-Fella Records released &quot;The Black Album&quot; on vinyl with no beats underneath Jay-Z&#x27;s lyrics, spurring producers and DJs to rework his farewell disc into creations such as &quot;The Brown Album&quot; and even &quot;The Grey Album&quot;, by Los Angeles producer Danger Mouse, which combines Jay&#x27;s words with music from the Beatles&#x27; self-titled album (also known as the &quot;White Album&quot;), breaking with the Roc-A-Fella&#x27;s tradition of not releasing acappella 12-inches, so producers could &quot;remix the hell out of it.&quot;

Several notable reworkings were released but of all the remixed albums, &quot;The Grey Album&quot; was the most popular. The hype around &quot;The Grey Album&quot; gained notoriety when EMI attempted to halt its distribution despite approval from Jay-Z and the two surviving Beatles, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr. EMI ordered Danger Mouse and retailers carrying the album to cease distribution. Music industry activist group Downhill Battle responded by coordinating Grey Tuesday, an electronic civil disobedience event held on February 24, 2004. Participating websites posted copies of &quot;The Grey Album&quot; for free download for a 24-hour period in protest of EMI&#x27;s attempts to prevent distribution of the mashup on the grounds that sampling is fair use and that a statutory license should be provided in the same manner as if an artist were to perform or record a cover version of a song. Hundreds of websites publicized the event with 170 hosting the album for download. Over 100,000 copies were downloaded on that day alone. The legal repercussions of the protest were minimal; a number of the participants received cease and desist letters from EMI, but no charges were filed in connection with the event.

<text>Mentmore is a village and civil parish in the Aylesbury Vale district of Buckinghamshire, England. It is about three miles east of Wingrave, three miles south east of Wing.

The village toponym is derived from the Old English for &quot;Menta&#x27;s moor&quot;. The Domesday Book of 1086 records the village as Mentmore.

Queen Edith, the daughter of Earl Godwin and wife of King Edward the Confessor had a hunting lodge at Mentmore, between the site of the present Mentmore Towers and the hamlet of Crafton at a site known as &quot;Berrystead&quot;. The well of this lodge is marked today by a wood still known as &quot;Prilow&quot;, derived from the Norman French &quot;pres l&#x27;ieu&quot; (&quot;near the water&quot;).

In 1808 &quot;Magna Britannia&quot; reported:

MENTMORE, in the hundred of Cotslow and deanery of Muresley, lies about eight miles to the north-east of Aylesbury. The manor was anciently in the families of Bussel and Zouche: in 1490 it was granted to Sir Reginald Bray, from whom it descended, by a female heir, to the family of Sandys: in 1729, it was purchased with the manor of Leadbourne, by Lord Viscount Limerick, of a Mr. Legoe, who inherited them from the family of Wigg. They are now the property of Richard Bard Harcourt esq. who purchased them of Lord Limerick&#x27;s son, James Earl of Clanbrassil. In the church are some memorials of the families of Theed and Wigg.
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;The impropriate rectory, which was given by the Bussells to the priory of St. Bartholomew, in Smithfield, is now the property of Mr. Harcourt, who is patron of the vicarage.&quot;
The Church of England parish church of St Mary the Virgin dates from the 14th century. It contains monuments to the Wigg and Theed families and one to Neil Primrose. It is a simple structure of three aisles and a clerestory. It was heavily restored by the Rothschild family in the 19th century. The tower has a ring of five bells, which were recently restored.

The village manor house, built by the Wigg family as a 16th-century half timbered structure, was re-faced in redbrick, with a Georgian front extension in the mid-18th century. The Wiggs were lords of the manor from the 16th to 18th centuries.

The ownership eventually passed to the Harcourt or D&#x27;Harcourt families, until it was brought in 1850 from the trustees of three Harcourt sisters who had been left insolvent on the death of their father. The purchaser was Baron Mayer de Rothschild.

The Baron employed the leading architect of the day Joseph Paxton to build a new grandiose mansion; the site chosen because of its fine elevation, was that of the village itself. To a Rothschild this was no problem, the village was moved to the site it occupies today. In fairness to the Baron the villagers were living in semi-derelict hovels, and were probably only too pleased to be rehoused.

The plan chosen for the new village was &quot;Tudor meets Victorian&quot; around a village green and mansion gates.
While Paxton and his son-in-law George Stokes worked on the mansion later to be known as Mentmore Towers, George Stokes also designed the first cottages for the new Mentmore. On the death of Baron Mayer in 1877 his heiress Hannah de Rothschild continued the building of the village using another architect George Devey (his work was a forerunner of the arts and crafts movement).These houses can be identified by the &#x27;H de R&#x27; cypher on their gables. After her marriage to the 5th Earl of Rosebery the building continued with another architect John Aspell; his work appears similar to that of Devey, but has less refinement and is clearly of a cheaper construction. The Old Post office in the centre of a block of housing is clearly Devy&#x27;s work, yet the houses adjoining are clearly of the lesser hand. The picturesque style Thatched or South Lodge is another of Devey&#x27;s work, as is the former riding school with its stable yard – (now a housing complex).

The cottage orné style Old Dairy, designed by George Stokes in 1859, is a pastiche of the Hameau de la Reine at Versailles. While intended as a functioning dairy, its verandas were also designed as a setting for Baroness Mayer de Rothschild&#x27;s afternoon tea parties. This is one of the last buildings still to be owned by the Rosebery Estate and was restored in 2007.

At this time Anglo Saxon remains were found near the site of the present front drive of Mentmore Towers. The drives to the mansion are the original public highways, which were also re-routed at this time.

By 1880 the village and its new approach roads were more or less finished and looked much as they do today. The late 6th Earl of Rosebery who died in 1974 was fond of saying nothing had been built in Mentmore in his lifetime. While this was not strictly true, as both he and his father had built stable blocks at the stud farms, one could believe what he said. The only buildings not owned by him were the church and the vicarage. The vicarage, an austere high gabled Victorian building, built in the 1880s, was sold by the Church Commissioners in the 1960s and is now a private house.

In 1977, Towers, village and farms were put up for sale in their entirety. Today the village retains much of its Victorian character. The stable blocks are now developments of new housing, and executive style homes have been built in the village, yet Mentmore would still appears predominantly unchanged.

<text>Frederic Thesiger, 1st Baron Chelmsford, PC, FRS (25 April 1794 – 5 October 1878) was a British jurist and Conservative politician. He was twice Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain.

==Early life==
Born in London, Thesiger was the third son of Charles Thesiger, collector of customs at St Vincent, West Indies, by his wife Mary Anne, daughter of Theophilus Williams. His paternal grandfather, John Andrew Thesiger, was born in Saxony but migrated to England and became secretary to Lord Rockingham. Thesiger&#x27;s uncle Sir Frederick Thesiger was naval aide-de-camp to Lord Nelson at the Battle of Copenhagen in 1801. 

==Career==
Thesiger was originally destined for a naval career, and he served as a midshipman on in 1807 at the second bombardment of Copenhagen. His only surviving brother died about this time, however, and he became entitled to succeed to a valuable estate in the West Indies. It was decided that he should leave the navy and study law with a view to practising in the West Indies and eventually managing his property in person. He proceeded to enter at Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1813, and was called to the bar on 18 November 1818. He joined the home circuit, and soon got into good practice at the Surrey sessions, while he also made a fortunate purchase in buying the right to appear in the old palace court (see Lord Steward). Another change of fortune, however, awaited him, for a volcano destroyed the family estate, and he was thrown back upon his prospect of a legal practice in the West Indies.

In 1824, he distinguished himself by his defence of Joseph Hunt when on his trial at Hertford with John Thurtell for the murder of William Weare; and eight years later at Chelmsford assizes he won a hard-fought action in an ejectment case after three trials, to which he attributed so much of his subsequent success that when he was raised to the peerage he elected to be created Baron Chelmsford, of Chelmsford in the County of Essex. In 1834, he was made King&#x27;s Counsel, and in 1835 was briefed in the Dublin election inquiry which unseated Daniel O&#x27;Connell. In 1840, he was elected member of parliament for Woodstock. In 1844, he became Solicitor General, but having ceased to enjoy the favour of the Duke of Marlborough, lost his seat for Woodstock and had to find another at Abingdon. In 1845, he became Attorney-General, holding the post until the fall of the Peel government on 3 July 1846. Thus by three days Thesiger missed being chief justice of the common pleas, for on 6 July Sir Nicholas Tindal died, and the seat on the bench, which would have been Thesiger&#x27;s as of right, fell to the Liberal attorney-general, Sir Thomas Wilde.

Thesiger remained in parliament, changing his seat, however, again in 1852, and becoming member for Stamford. During this period he enjoyed a very large practice at the bar, being instructed in many &quot;causes célèbres&quot; including the Swynfen will case and Cardinal Newman&#x27;s criminal prosecution for his libel of Giacinto Achilli. On Lord Derby coming into office for the second time in 1858, Thesiger was raised straight from the bar to the Lord Chancellorship (as were Brougham and Vaux, Selborne and Halsbury). He served as Lord Chancellor again in Derby&#x27;s 1866–67 government. In 1868. Lord Derby retired, and his successor, Benjamin Disraeli, wanted Lord Cairns as Lord Chancellor. Lord Chelmsford was very sore at his supersession and the manner of it, but according to Lord Malmesbury he retired under a compact made before he took office.

==Family==
Lord Chelmsford married Anna Maria Tinling, daughter of William Tinling and Frances Pierson, in 1822. They had four sons and three daughters. His eldest son, Frederic, who succeeded to his peerage, earned distinction as a soldier, commanding at the disastrous defeat at Isandlwana, but recovering some of his reputation by his victory at Ulundi. Chelmsford&#x27;s second son Charles Wemyss Thesiger (1831–1903), was a Lieutenant-General in the Army. Chelmsford&#x27;s third son, Alfred Henry Thesiger, was a Lord Justice of Appeal, but died aged 42. Lady Chelmsford died in April 1875, aged 75. Lord Chelmsford survived her by three years and died in London on 5 October 1878, aged 84. He is buried in Brompton Cemetery in London. His daughter, Julia (1833–1904) was married to Sir John Eardley Inglis who commanded the British forces during the Siege of Lucknow in 1857. She later wrote of her experiences during the siege including extracts from her diary.

<doc id="417929" wikidata="Q278846" url="?curid=417929" title="LASIK">
<text>LASIK or Lasik (; &quot;laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis&quot;), commonly referred to as laser eye surgery or laser vision correction, is a type of refractive surgery for the correction of myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism. LASIK surgery is performed by an ophthalmologist who uses a femtosecond laser or a microkeratome to create a corneal flap to expose the corneal stroma and then an excimer laser to reshape the corneal stroma in order to improve visual acuity.

LASIK is very similar to another surgical corrective procedure, photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), and LASEK. All represent advances over radial keratotomy in the surgical treatment of refractive errors of vision. For people with moderate to high myopia or thin corneas which cannot be treated with LASIK or PRK, the phakic intraocular lens is an alternative.

As of 2018, roughly 9.5 million Americans have had LASIK and, globally, between 1991 and 2016, more than 40 million procedures were performed. However, the procedure seemed to be a declining option as of 2015.
== Process ==
In March 2009, the FDA officially recognized the new LASIK standard from The American National Standards Institute (ANSI), entitled &quot;Laser Systems for Corneal Reshaping.&quot;

A detailed pre-operative screening will assess corneal thickness, shape, and refractive error, ensuring the patient is a suitable candidate. During the surgery, a surgeon uses a femtosecond laser or a microkeratome blade to create a thin corneal flap, which is then carefully folded back to expose the underlying tissue. An excimer laser precisely reshapes the stromal layer of the cornea, removing microscopic amounts of tissue to correct refractive errors. This step is guided by a pre-determined surgical plan tailored to the patient&#x27;s specific visual needs. After the cornea is reshaped, the flap is repositioned, serving as a natural bandage that adheres without the need for stitches. The entire procedure typically takes 10–15 minutes per eye and offers minimal discomfort and rapid recovery, allowing most patients to return to normal activities within a day or two.

=== Preoperative procedures ===

==== Pre-operative examination and education ====
In the United States, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved LASIK for people 18 years of age and older, but the American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends people wait until age 21 because vision needs to stabilize. More importantly the patient&#x27;s eye prescription should be stable for at least one year prior to surgery.
The patient may be examined with pupillary dilation and education given prior to the procedure. Before the surgery, the patient&#x27;s corneas are examined with a pachymeter to determine their thickness, and with a topographer, or corneal topography machine, to measure their surface contour. Using low-power lasers, a topographer creates a topographic map of the cornea. The procedure is contraindicated if the topographer finds difficulties such as keratoconus The preparatory process also detects astigmatism and other irregularities in the shape of the cornea. Using this information, the surgeon calculates the amount and the location of corneal tissue to be removed. The patient is prescribed and self-administers an antibiotic beforehand to minimize the risk of infection after the procedure and is sometimes offered a short acting oral sedative medication as a pre-medication. Prior to the procedure, anaesthetic eye drops are instilled. Factors that may rule out LASIK for some patients include large pupils, thin corneas and extremely dry eyes.

=== Operative procedure ===

LASIK permanently changes the shape of the cornea, the clear covering of the front of the eye, using an excimer laser. A mechanical microkeratome (a blade device) or a laser keratome (femtosecond laser) is used to cut a flap in the cornea. A hinge is left at one end of this flap. The flap is folded back revealing the corneal stroma, the middle section of the cornea. Pulses from a computer-controlled laser (excimer laser) vaporize a portion of the stroma and the flap is replaced.

Performing the laser ablation in the deeper corneal stroma provides for more rapid visual recovery and less pain than the earlier technique, photorefractive keratectomy (PRK).

=== Postoperative care ===
Patients are usually given a course of antibiotic and anti-inflammatory eye drops. These are continued in the weeks following surgery. Patients are told to rest and are given dark eyeglasses to protect their eyes from bright lights and occasionally protective goggles to prevent rubbing of the eyes when asleep and to reduce dry eyes. They also are required to moisturize the eyes with preservative-free tears and follow directions for prescription drops. Occasionally after the procedure a bandage contact lens is placed to aid the healing, and typically removed after 3–4 days. Patients should be adequately informed by their surgeons of the importance of proper post-operative care to minimize the risk of complications.

=== Wavefront-guided ===
Wavefront-guided LASIK is a variation of LASIK surgery in which, rather than applying a simple correction of only long/short-sightedness and astigmatism (only lower order aberrations as in traditional LASIK), an ophthalmologist applies a spatially varying correction, guiding the computer-controlled excimer laser with measurements from a wavefront sensor. The goal is to achieve a more optically perfect eye, though the result still depends on the physician&#x27;s success at predicting changes that occur during healing and other factors that may have to do with the regularity/irregularity of the cornea and the axis of any residual astigmatism. Another important factor is whether the excimer laser can correctly register eye position in 3 dimensions, and to track the eye in all the possible directions of eye movement. If a wavefront guided treatment is performed with less than perfect registration and tracking, pre-existing aberrations can be worsened. In older patients, scattering from microscopic particles (cataract or incipient cataract) may play a role that outweighs any benefit from wavefront correction.

When treating a patient with preexisting astigmatism, most wavefront-guided LASIK lasers are designed to treat regular astigmatism as determined externally by corneal topography. In patients who have an element of internally induced astigmatism, therefore, the wavefront-guided astigmatism correction may leave regular astigmatism behind (a cross-cylinder effect). If the patient has preexisting irregular astigmatism, wavefront-guided approaches may leave both regular and irregular astigmatism behind. This can result in less-than-optimal visual acuity compared with a wavefront-guided approach combined with vector planning, as shown in a 2008 study.

The &quot;leftover&quot; astigmatism after a purely surface-guided laser correction can be calculated beforehand, and is called ocular residual astigmatism (ORA). ORA is a calculation of astigmatism due to the noncorneal surface (internal) optics. The purely refraction-based approach represented by wavefront analysis actually conflicts with corneal surgical experience developed over many years.

The pathway to &quot;super vision&quot; thus may require a more customized approach to corneal astigmatism than is usually attempted, and any remaining astigmatism ought to be regular (as opposed to irregular), which are both fundamental principles of vector planning overlooked by a purely wavefront-guided treatment plan. This was confirmed by the 2008 study mentioned above, which found a greater reduction in corneal astigmatism and better visual outcomes under mesopic conditions using wavefront technology combined with vector analysis than using wavefront technology alone, and also found equivalent higher-order aberrations (see below). Vector planning also proved advantageous in patients with keratoconus.

No good data can be found that compare the percentage of LASIK procedures that employ wavefront guidance versus the percentage that do not, nor the percentage of refractive surgeons who have a preference one way or the other. Wavefront technology continues to be positioned as an &quot;advance&quot; in LASIK with putative advantages; however, it is clear that not all LASIK procedures are performed with wavefront guidance.

Still, surgeons claim patients are generally more satisfied with this technique than with previous methods, particularly regarding lowered incidence of &quot;halos,&quot; the visual artifact caused by spherical aberration induced in the eye by earlier methods. A meta-analysis of eight trials showed a lower incidence of these higher order aberrations in patients who had wavefront-guided LASIK compared to non-wavefront-guided LASIK. Based on their experience, the United States Air Force has described WFG-Lasik as giving &quot;superior vision results&quot;.

=== Topography-assisted ===
Topography-assisted LASIK is intended to be an advancement in precision and reduce night-vision side effects. The first topography-assisted device received FDA approval 13 September 2013.

== History ==

=== Barraquer&#x27;s early work ===
In the 1950s, the microkeratome and keratomileusis technique were developed in Bogotá, Colombia, by the Spanish ophthalmologist José Barraquer. In his clinic, he would cut thin (one hundredth of a mm thick) flaps in the cornea to alter its shape. Barraquer also investigated how much of the cornea had to be left unaltered in order to provide stable long-term results.

=== Laser refractive surgery ===
In 1980, Rangaswamy Srinivasan, Samuel E. Blum, and James J. Wynne at the IBM Research laboratory, discovered that an ultraviolet excimer laser could etch living tissue, with precision and with no thermal damage to the surrounding area. The phenomenon was termed &quot;ablative photo-decomposition&quot; (APD).
Five years later, in 1985, Steven Trokel at the Edward S. Harkness Eye Institute, Columbia University in New York City, published his work using the excimer laser in radial keratotomy. He wrote,
:&quot;The central corneal flattening obtained by radial diamond knife incisions has been duplicated by radial laser incisions in 18 enucleated human eyes. The incisions, made by 193 nm far-ultraviolet light radiation emitted by the excimer laser, produced corneal flattening ranging from 0.12 to 5.35 diopters. Both the depth of the corneal incisions and the degree of central corneal flattening correlated with the laser energy applied. Histopathology revealed the remarkably smooth edges of the laser incisions.&quot;

=== Patent ===
A number of patents have been issued for several techniques related to LASIK. Rangaswamy Srinivasan and James Wynne filed a patent application on the ultraviolet excimer laser, in 1986, issued in 1988. In 1989, Gholam A. Peyman was granted a US patent for using an excimer laser to modify corneal curvature. It was,
:&quot;A method and apparatus for modifying the curvature of a live cornea via use of an excimer laser. The live cornea has a thin layer removed therefrom, leaving an exposed internal surface thereon. Then, either the surface or thin layer is exposed to the laser beam along a predetermined pattern to ablate desired portions. The thin layer is then replaced onto the surface. Ablating a central area of the surface or thin layer makes the cornea less curved, while ablating an annular area spaced from the center of the surface or layer makes the cornea more curved. The desired predetermined pattern is formed by use of a variable diaphragm, a rotating orifice of variable size, a movable mirror or a movable fiber optic cable through which the laser beam is directed towards the exposed internal surface or removed thin layer.&quot;
The patents related to so-called broad-beam LASIK and PRK technologies were granted to US companies including Visx and Summit during 1990–1995 based on the fundamental US patent issued to IBM (1988) which claimed the use of UV laser for the ablation of organic tissues.

=== Implementation in the United States ===
The LASIK technique was implemented in the US after its successful application elsewhere. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) commenced a trial of the excimer laser in 1989. The first enterprise to receive FDA approval to use an excimer laser for photo-refractive keratectomy was Summit Technology.
In 1992, under the direction of the FDA, Greek ophthalmologist Ioannis Pallikaris introduced LASIK to ten VISX centers. In 1998, the &quot;Kremer Excimer Laser&quot;, serial number KEA 940202, received FDA approval for its singular use for performing LASIK. Subsequently, Summit Technology was the first company to receive FDA approval to mass manufacture and distribute excimer lasers. VISX and other companies followed.
 Pallikaris suggested a flap of cornea could be raised by microkeratome prior to the performing of PRK with the excimer laser. The addition of a flap to PRK became known as LASIK. The use of a femtosecond laser to raise the flap of cornea was discovered after a graduate student at the University of Michigan suffered an accidental laser eye injury in 1993. Tibor Juhasz and Ron Kurtz developed this approach and went on to found IntraLase to perform bladeless LASIK surgery.

=== Recent years ===
The procedure seems to be a declining option for many in the United States, dropping more than 50 percent, from about 1.5 million surgeries in 2007 to 604,000 in 2015, according to the eye-care data source Market Scope. A study determined the frequency with which LASIK was searched on Google from 2007 to 2011. Within this time frame, LASIK searches declined by 40% in the United States. Countries such as the U.K. and India also showed a decline, 22% and 24% respectively. Canada, however, showed an increase in LASIK searches by 8%. This decrease in interest can be attributed to several factors: the emergence of refractive cataract surgery, the economic recession in 2008, and unfavorable media coverage from the FDA&#x27;s 2008 press release on LASIK.

== Effectiveness ==
In 2006, the British National Health Service&#x27;s National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) considered evidence of the effectiveness and the potential risks of the laser surgery, stating &quot;current evidence suggests that photorefractive (laser) surgery for the correction of refractive errors is safe and effective for use in appropriately selected patients. Clinicians undertaking photorefractive (laser) surgery for the correction of refractive errors should ensure that patients understand the benefits and potential risks of the procedure. Risks include failure to achieve the expected improvement in unaided vision, development of new visual disturbances, corneal infection and flap complications. These risks should be weighed against those of wearing spectacles or contact lenses.&quot; The FDA reports &quot;The safety and effectiveness of refractive procedures has not been determined in patients with some diseases.&quot;

=== Satisfaction ===
Surveys of LASIK surgery find rates of patient satisfaction between 92 and 98 percent. In March 2008, the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery published a patient satisfaction meta-analysis of over 3,000 peer-reviewed articles from international clinical journals. Data from a systematic literature review conducted from 1988 to 2008, consisting of 309 peer-reviewed articles about &quot;properly conducted, well-designed, randomized clinical trials&quot; found a 95.4 percent patient satisfaction rate among LASIK patients.

A 2017 study claims that overall, preoperative symptoms decreased significantly, and visual acuity excelled. A meta-analysis discovered that 97% of patients achieved uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) of 20/40, while 62% achieved 20/20.

=== Dissatisfaction ===
Some people with poor outcomes from LASIK surgical procedures report a significantly reduced quality of life because of vision problems or pain associated with the surgery. A small percentage of patients may need further surgery because their condition is over- or under-corrected. Some patients need to wear contact lenses or glasses even after treatment.

The most common reason for dissatisfaction in LASIK patients is chronic severe dry eye. Independent research indicates 95% of patients experience dry eye in the initial post-operative period. This number has been reported to up to 60% after one month. Symptoms begin to improve in the vast majority of patients in the 6 to 12 months following the surgery. However, 30% of post-LASIK referrals to tertiary ophthalmology care centers have been shown to be due to chronic dry eye.

Morris Waxler, a former FDA official who was involved in the approval of LASIK, subsequently criticized its widespread use. In 2010, Waxler made media appearances and claimed that the procedure had a failure rate greater than 50%. The FDA responded that Waxler&#x27;s information was &quot;filled with false statements, incorrect citations&quot; and &quot;mischaracterization of results&quot;.

=== Presbyopia ===
A type of LASIK, known as presbyLasik, may be used in presbyopia. Results are, however, more variable and some people have a decrease in visual acuity.

== Risks ==

=== Dry eyes ===
95% of patients report dry-eye symptoms after LASIK. Although it is usually temporary, it can develop into chronic and severe dry eye syndrome. Quality of life can be severely affected by dry-eye syndrome.

Underlying conditions with dry eye such as Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome are considered contraindications to Lasik.

Treatments include artificial tears, prescription tears, and punctal occlusion. Punctal occlusion is accomplished by placing a collagen or silicone plug in the tear duct, which normally drains fluid from the eye. Some patients complain of ongoing dry-eye symptoms despite such treatments and the symptoms may be permanent.

=== Halos ===
Some post-LASIK patients see halos and starbursts around bright lights at night.

Complications due to LASIK have been classified as those that occur due to preoperative, intraoperative, early postoperative, or late postoperative sources: According to the UK National Health Service, complications occur in fewer than 5% of cases.

=== Other complications ===
* Flap complications – The incidence of flap complications is about 0.244%. Flap complications (such as displaced flaps or folds in the flaps that necessitate repositioning, diffuse lamellar keratitis, and epithelial ingrowth) are common in lamellar corneal surgeries but rarely lead to permanent loss of visual acuity. The incidence of these microkeratome-related complications decreases with increased physician experience.
* Flap interface particles – are a finding whose clinical significance is undetermined. Particles of various sizes and reflectivity are clinically visible in about 38.7% of eyes examined via slit lamp biomicroscopy and in 100% of eyes examined by confocal microscopy.
* Diffuse lamellar keratitis  – an inflammatory process that involves an accumulation of white blood cells at the interface between the LASIK corneal flap and the underlying stroma. It is known colloquially as &quot;sands of Sahara syndrome&quot; because on slit lamp exam, the inflammatory infiltrate appears similar to waves of sand. The USAeyes organisation reports an incidence of 2.3% after LASIK. It is most commonly treated with steroid eye drops. Sometimes it is necessary for the eye surgeon to lift the flap and manually remove the accumulated cells. DLK has not been reported with photorefractive keratectomy due to the absence of flap creation.
* Infection – the incidence of infection responsive to treatment has been estimated at 0.04%.
* Post-LASIK corneal ectasia – a condition where the cornea starts to bulge forwards at a variable time after LASIK, causing irregular astigmatism. the condition is similar to keratoconus.
* Subconjunctival hemorrhage – A report shows the incidence of subconjunctival hemorrhage has been estimated at 10.5%.
* Corneal scarring – or permanent problems with cornea&#x27;s shape making it impossible to wear contact lenses.
* Epithelial ingrowth – estimated at 0.01%.
* Traumatic flap dislocations – Cases of late traumatic flap dislocations have been reported up to thirteen years after LASIK.
* Retinal detachment: estimated at 0.36 percent.
* Choroidal neovascularization: estimated at 0.33 percent.
* Uveitis: estimated at 0.18 percent.
* For climbers – Although the cornea usually is thinner after LASIK, because of the removal of part of the stroma, refractive surgeons strive to maintain the maximum thickness to avoid structurally weakening the cornea. Decreased atmospheric pressure at higher altitudes has not been demonstrated as extremely dangerous to the eyes of LASIK patients. However, some mountain climbers have experienced a myopic shift at extreme altitudes.
* Late postoperative complications – A large body of evidence on the chances of long-term complications is not yet established and may be changing due to advances in operator experience, instruments and techniques.
* Potential best vision loss may occur a year after the surgery regardless of the use of eyewear.
* Ocular neuropathic pain (corneal neuralgia); rare

=== FDA&#x27;s position ===
In October 2009, the US FDA, the US National Eye Institute (NEI), and the US Department of Defense (DoD) launched the LASIK Quality of Life Collaboration Project (LQOLCP) to help better understand the potential risk of severe problems that can result from LASIK in response to widespread reports of problems experienced by patients after LASIK laser eye surgery. This project examined patient-reported outcomes with LASIK (PROWL). The project consisted of three phases: pilot phase, phase I, phase II (PROWL-1) and phase III (PROWL-2).

The results of the LASIK Quality of Life Study were published in October 2014.
The FDA&#x27;s director of the Division of Ophthalmic Devices said about the LASIK study: &quot;Given the large number of patients undergoing LASIK annually, dissatisfaction and disabling symptoms may occur in a significant number of patients&quot;. Also in 2014, FDA published an article highlighting the risks and a list of factors and conditions individuals should consider when choosing a doctor for their refractive surgery.

=== Contraindications ===
Not everyone is eligible to receive LASIK. Severe keratoconus or thin corneas may disqualify patients from LASIK, though other procedures may be viable options. Those with Fuchs&#x27; corneal endothelial dystrophy, corneal epithelial basement membrane dystrophy, retinal tears, autoimmune diseases, severe dry eyes, and significant blepharitis should be treated before consideration for LASIK. Women who are pregnant or nursing are generally not eligible to undergo LASIK.

People with large pupils (e.g. due to taking medications or in the younger age group) may be particularly prone to symptoms such as glare, halos, starbursts, and ghost images (double vision) in dim light after surgery. Because the laser can only work on the inner section of the cornea, the outer rim is left unaffected. In dim lighting, a patient&#x27;s pupils dilate and may be predisposed to optic aberrations due to refractive asynchrony of the two regions with regards to the incoming light.

== Further research ==

Since 1991, there have been further developments such as faster lasers; larger spot areas; bladeless flap incisions; intraoperative corneal pachymetry; and &quot;wavefront-optimized&quot; and &quot;wavefront-guided&quot; techniques which were introduced by the University of Michigan&#x27;s Center for Ultrafast Optical Science. The goal of replacing standard LASIK in refractive surgery is to avoid permanently weakening the cornea with incisions and to deliver less energy to the surrounding tissues. More recently, techniques like Epi-Bowman Keratectomy have been developed that avoid touching the epithelial basement membrane or Bowman&#x27;s layer.

=== Experimental techniques ===
* &quot;plain&quot; LASIK: LASEK, Epi-LASIK,
* Wavefront-guided PRK,
* advanced intraocular lenses.
* Femtosecond laser intrastromal vision correction: using all-femtosecond correction, for example, Femtosecond Lenticule EXtraction, FLIVC, or IntraCOR),
* Keraflex: a thermobiochemical solution which has received the CE Mark for refractive correction. and is in European clinical trials for the correction of myopia and keratoconus.
* Technolas FEMTEC laser: for incisionless IntraCOR ablation for presbyopia, with trials ongoing for myopia and other conditions.
* LASIK with the IntraLase femtosecond laser: early trials comparing to the LASIK with microkeratomes for the correction of myopia suggest no significant differences in safety or efficacy. However, the femtosecond laser has a potential advantage in predictability, although this finding was not significant.

== Comparison to photorefractive keratectomy ==
A systematic review that compared PRK and LASIK concluded that LASIK has shorter recovery time and less pain. The two techniques after a period of one year have similar results.

A 2017 systematic review found uncertainty in visual acuity, but found that in one study, those receiving PRK were less likely to achieve a refractive error, and were less likely to have an over-correction than compared to LASIK.

<text>Gurabo () is a town and municipality in eastern Puerto Rico. It is located in the central eastern region, north of San Lorenzo; south of Trujillo Alto; east of Caguas; and west of Carolina and Juncos. Gurabo is spread over 9 barrios and Gurabo Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Gurabo&#x27;s history dates as far back as the 17th century, when it was actually part of Caguas. Then, the area was known as &quot;Burabo&quot;. By 1700, transportation, medical and economic troubles were crippling the population of the &quot;Burabo&quot; area; traveling to Caguas&#x27; center for business and medical help was not easy and took hours. This led many of &quot;Burabo&quot;&#x27;s citizens to seek autonomy for the area.

It would be long, however, before Gurabo was separated from Caguas. The separation movement was brought forward by an 1812 meeting of all 168 family leaders in Gurabo, who decided to have Luis del Carmen Echevarría lead them in their quest for independence, based on the large number of residents in &quot;Burabo&quot;.

In 1815, Gurabo became a municipality. In 1822, the first Catholic church in town was erected. In 1903, the first Baptist church opened its doors in Gurabo town.

Gurabo is also known as &quot;La Ciudad de las Escaleras&quot;, or the &quot;City of Stairs&quot;. Located in the town center district of El Cerro, the stairs (step streets) are about twenty-two floors high, and they are painted in bright colors.

Gurabo&#x27;s mayor is Rosachely Rivera Santana.

<doc id="417932" wikidata="Q7393" url="?curid=417932" title="Emperor Ming of Jin">
<text>Emperor Ming of Jin (; 299 – 18 October 325, personal name Sima Shao (司馬紹), courtesy name Daoji (道畿), was an emperor of the Eastern Jin dynasty of China. During his brief reign (323–325), he led the weakened Jin out of domination by the warlord Wang Dun, but at his early death, the empire was left to his young son Emperor Cheng, and the fragile balance of power that he created was soon broken, leading to the Su Jun Disturbance and weakening the Jin state even further.

==Early life==
Sima Shao was born in 299, as the oldest son of his father Sima Rui, then the Prince of Langya, by his lowly-born concubine Lady Xun, who then in 300 gave birth to another son, Sima Pou (司馬裒). Sima Rui&#x27;s wife, Princess Yu Mengmu (虞孟母), who was herself childless, became very jealous of Lady Xun and mistreated her greatly. Lady Xun, not able to bear the abuse, complained bitterly, and was thrown out of the household. Sima Shao was therefore raised by Princess Yu, with whom he apparently had a cordial relationship. During his youth, he was considered intelligent and quick-thinking, although eventually his brother Sima Pou became more favored by their father.

While Sima Rui served as Left Prime Minister under Emperor Min, the teenage Sima Shao was put in charge of defending Guangling. After Sima Rui declared himself the Prince of Jin on 6 April 317, following Emperor Min&#x27;s capture by Han-Zhao on 11 December 316, he initially wanted to make Sima Pou his crown prince, but after Wang Dao pointed out that traditionally the older son should succeed him, he created Sima Shao crown prince on 1 May of the same year. Sima Shao remained in that status after his father declared himself emperor (as Emperor Yuan) in April 318, after Han-Zhao executed Emperor Min; by this time, his brother Sima Pou had passed away.

==As crown prince==
While crown prince, Sima Shao was known for seeking out talented men and befriending them, treating them as friends and not as subordinates. These included Wang Dao, Yu Liang (whose sister Yu Wenjun he married), Wen Jiao, Huan Yi (桓彝; father of Huan Wen), and Ruan Fang (阮放). He was also known for his filial piety and his literary studies. He later also added martial arts to his studies, and he often visited troops to encourage them.

When Wang Dun rebelled against Emperor Yuan in 322, the capital Jiankang fell easily to Wang. Upon hearing news that Wang had breached Jiankang&#x27;s defenses, Crown Prince Shao was going to himself make a last stand, but Wen stopped him by cutting off the ropes off his horse. When Wang subsequently forced Emperor Yuan into submission, he considered deposing Crown Prince Shao by falsely accusing Crown Prince Shao of being disobedient to Emperor Yuan. However, Wen prevented this by publicly praising Crown Prince Shao of filial piety, making Wang&#x27;s putative accusations not credible.

Early in January 323, Emperor Yuan died in distress after his defeat by Wang. Crown Prince Shao succeeded to the throne as Emperor Ming.

==Reign==
One of the first things that Emperor Ming did was locating his birth mother Lady Xun, putting her in a mansion, and creating her the Lady of Jian&#x27;an. However, perhaps out of respect for his deceased stepmother Princess Yu (who had died in 312 but was posthumously honored as an empress by Emperor Yuan in October 320), he never gave her an empress dowager title—and Emperor Ming honored Princess Yu&#x27;s family as appropriately he would a mother&#x27;s family—and he was particularly close to Princess Yu&#x27;s brother Yu Yin (虞胤). A few months after he took the throne, Lady Xun moved into the palace. Emperor Ming also created his wife, Crown Princess Yu, empress.

Wang Dun did not think much of the new emperor, and he plotted usurping the throne. In summer 323, he had Emperor Ming summon him to the capital, but actually did not go to the capital, but only moved his headquarters from Wuchang (武昌, in modern Ezhou, Hubei) to Gushu (姑孰, in modern Ma&#x27;anshan, Anhui), closer to the capital, and also taking over the governorship of the capital province. When Emperor Ming tried to commission the official Xi Jian as the military commander at Hefei, positionally behind Wang, Wang resisted, and Emperor Ming was forced to recall Xi.

In 324, Wang Dun grew ill, and became resolved to overthrow Jin so that his adopted son, Wang Ying (王應), could be emperor. (This was after his initial two inclinations—ordering that his troops be disbanded after his death, or having Wang Ying continue to control his troops but pledging allegiance to Emperor Ming—were rejected by his strategists.) He also made Wen Jiao, by that point a trusted assistant, the mayor of Jiankang, to keep an eye on the emperor—forgetting that Wen was loyal to Emperor Ming, and upon arrival in Jiankang, Wen informed Emperor Ming of Wang&#x27;s plans, as well as his illness. Wang Dao, also loyal to Emperor Ming, then falsely declared to the imperial forces that Wang Dun had died, further increasing their morale, and Emperor Ming reinforced his troops by summoning battle-tested soldiers from the northern borders with Later Zhao back to the capital. (When the generals in command of these forces, Su Jun and Liu Xia (劉遐) arrived at Jiankang, even though it was dark in the night, Emperor Ming went to personally visit the troops, greatly enhancing their morale.) Wang Dun then sent his forces east to Jiankang, headed by his brother Wang Han (王含, Wang Ying&#x27;s biological father) and Qian Feng (錢鳳), but could not decisively defeat the imperial troops. The imperial troops then attacked by, defeating Wang Han. Wang Dun, upon hearing initial news of defeat, died. The imperial forces then defeated Wang Han&#x27;s troops more completely, forcing Wang Han and Wang Ying to flee, but they were captured by Wang Dun&#x27;s brother Wang Shu (王舒), who executed them by drowning to show his loyalty.

In 325, Emperor Ming posthumously awarded officials who had died at Wang Dun&#x27;s hands throughout the years with titles and honors. He also put the general Tao Kan, known for his military and governing capabilities, in charge of most of Wang Dun&#x27;s former domain, including the key Jing Province (荊州, modern Hubei).

In fall 325, Emperor Ming grew ill. He entrusted his four-year-old son, Crown Prince Yan, to a group of high-level officials, including Sima Yang (司馬羕) the Prince of Xiyang, Wang Dao, Bian Kun (卞壼), Xi Jian, Yu Liang, Lu Ye (陸瞱), and Wen Jiao, perhaps intending that they lead by group with a balance of power. He died soon thereafter—only 26 years old. The balance of power that he left was soon broken, however, as Empress Dowager Yu became the regent, and her brother Yu Liang became the most powerful of the officials, eventually offending Su Jun and Zu Yue into a rebellion that damaged Jin for years.

<text>Mentmore Towers, historically known simply as &quot;Mentmore&quot;, is a 19th-century English country house built between 1852 and 1854 for the Rothschild family in the village of Mentmore in Buckinghamshire. Sir Joseph Paxton and his son-in-law, George Henry Stokes, designed the building in the 19th-century revival of late 16th and early 17th-century Elizabethan and Jacobean styles called Jacobethan. The house was designed for the banker and collector of fine art Baron Mayer de Rothschild as a country home, and as a display case for his collection of fine art. The mansion has been described as one of the greatest houses of the Victorian era. Mentmore was inherited by Hannah Primrose, Countess of Rosebery, née Rothschild, and owned by her descendants, the Earls of Rosebery.

Mentmore was the first of what were to become virtual Rothschild estates in the Vale of Aylesbury. Baron Mayer de Rothschild began purchasing land in the area in 1846. Later, other members of the family built houses at Tring in Hertfordshire, Ascott, Aston Clinton, Waddesdon and Halton. 
Much of the estate was sold in 1944, but the mansion, its grounds, formal gardens, several farms and the majority of the village of Mentmore remained in the ownership of Harry Primrose, 6th Earl of Rosebery, until his death in 1974. The Earl&#x27;s executors explored the possibility of Mentmore Towers along with its contents being preserved intact as a heritage property and opened to the public, as has been the case with some other National Trust properties (including Waddesdon). Despite prolonged discussions between the Executors and Government representatives over the following three years, no agreement to save the house for the nation was reached. Thus, in 1977, the contents of the house were sold at public auction by Sotheby&#x27;s. The following year the empty mansion with its formal gardens and 80 acres were sold to the Maharishi Foundation who occupied it for the next two decades. In 1999, it was again sold, to investor Simon Halabi, who planned to build additional hotel and conference facilities; the plan did not proceed and the property was allowed to deteriorate. In 1992 the Mentmore Golf and Country Club opened, on land previously owned by the estate; it closed in 2015. The house is currently abandoned.

Mentmore Towers is a Grade I listed building, with its park and gardens listed Grade II*.

==Architecture==

Baron Rothschild commissioned Sir Joseph Paxton, who was then designing and supervising construction of the much-admired Crystal Palace, to design Mentmore. Paxton was responsible for the ridge and furrow glass roof which covered the central hall, designed to imitate the arcaded courtyard of a Renaissance palazzo, while Stokes was co-architect and clerk of works. The builder was the London firm George Myers, frequently employed by members of the Rothschild family.

In keeping with the contents intended to be displayed within, the interiors take their inspiration principally from the Italian Renaissance, although the house also contains drawing rooms and cabinets decorated in the gilded styles of late 18th-century France. The external design is closely based on that of Robert Smythson&#x27;s Wollaton Hall.

==Earls of Rosebery==

Baron Mayer de Rothschild and his wife enjoyed the house for over twenty years before their deaths, his in 1874 and the Baroness&#x27;s some eighteen months later. The house and estate were then inherited by their daughter Hannah, later Countess of Rosebery. Following her death from Bright&#x27;s disease in 1890 at age 39, the house became the home of her widower Archibald Philip Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery, later Prime Minister for two years from 1894. In 1922, the fifth earl gave the estate to his son Harry Meyer Archibald Primrose, Lord Dalmeny, who in 1929, on the death of his father, became the sixth Earl.

Both earls bred numerous winners of classic horse races at the two stud farms on the estate, including five Epsom Derby winners. These were Ladas, Sir Visto, and Cicero from the Crafton Stud; plus Ocean Swell and Blue Peter from the Mentmore stud. Both stud farms were within a kilometre of the mansion and together with the stable yard were designed by the architect George Devey, who also designed many cottages in the estate&#x27;s villages of Mentmore, Crafton and Ledburn.

===Second World War===
The second wife of the sixth Earl, Eva Primrose, Countess of Rosebery (DBE), was interested in the arts and was acquainted with Kenneth Clark and other national art museum directors. As a result of Lady Rosebery&#x27;s friendships, Mentmore was chosen by the British government to store part of the British national art collections during the Second World War. The collections of the National Portrait Gallery were subsequently stored at Mentmore for the duration of the war, along with pieces from the Royal Collection, including the Gold State Coach. Further works transferred to Mentmore included the portraits from Speaker&#x27;s House in the Palace of Westminster, and tapestries, furniture and Grinling Gibbons carvings from Hampton Court Palace.

The royal coach was stored in the &quot;battery room&quot; subsequently nicknamed the &quot;refuge&quot;, part of the &quot;gas house&quot;, a group of outbuildings where gas and electricity had once been produced for the estate. Four men guarded the refuge at night, and two during the day.

===Sale and dispersal===
The possible purchase of Mentmore for the nation through the government&#x27;s National Land Fund was the desire of Roy Strong, the director of the V&amp;A, who hoped that Mentmore would become a &quot;branch&quot; of his museum devoted to 19th-century decorative arts as Ham House was for the 17th century and Osterley was for the 18th century. The government refused to spend such large sums from the fund, and the sale fell through.
Following the death of the sixth earl in 1974, the Labour government of James Callaghan refused to accept the contents in lieu of inheritance taxes, which could have turned the house into one of England&#x27;s finest museums of European furniture, &quot;objets d&#x27;art&quot; and Victorian era architecture. The government was offered the house and contents for UK£2 million (), but the offer was declined by the Department for the Environment. The department cited the high cost of maintaining Mentmore, which it estimated could rise above £80,000 per year. The possibility of sourcing the money from the National Land Fund was also explored, but the government was only willing to commit a portion of the necessary funding from the NLF, insisting that the rest should come by private means, which were &quot;not forthcoming&quot;.

After three more years of fruitless discussion, the executors of the estate sold the contents by public auction, and the large collection was dispersed. The estate made over £6,000,000 (), but a tiny fraction of its estimated worth today. Among the paintings sold were works by Gainsborough, Reynolds, Boucher, Drouais, Moroni and other well known artists, and cabinet makers, including Jean Henri Riesener and Chippendale. Also represented were the finest German and Russian silver- and goldsmiths, and makers of Limoges enamel. This Rothschild/Mentmore collection is said to have been one of the finest ever to be assembled in private hands, other than the collections of the Russian and British royal families. The house itself was purchased by the Maharishi International College in December 1978 for £240,000. The sale of Mentmore has been described as a &quot;turning point for the preservation movement&quot;.

Several family portraits, sculptures and furnishing were relocated from Mentmore prior to the sale by the Roseberys to their ancestral Scottish home, Dalmeny House, near Edinburgh. Items from Mentmore at Dalmeny include tapestries, Sèvres porcelain, and an equestrian statue by Joseph Boehm of &quot;King Tom&quot;, the foundation stallion for Baron Mayer de Rothschild&#x27;s Mentmore and Crafton Studs.

==Maharishi Foundation==
Mentmore became the headquarters for Maharishi Mahesh Yogi&#x27;s educational charity, the Maharishi Foundation, in 1978. As of 1997 the Natural Law Party also rented rooms there. The building was put up for sale in 1997 but did not change owners until 1999 when it was purchased by investor Simon Halabi.

==Simon Halabi==
Under the ownership of Halabi, the property was renamed Mentmore Towers Ltd, with the intention of converting it into a luxury hotel with 171 suites, including 122 in a new wing on the slope below the house. However, in September 2004, Jonathan Davey, a local resident, won a last-minute injunction in the High Court to halt work on the hotel while a judicial review investigated whether the planning permission granted had followed the correct procedures. In March 2005, the High Court ruled that Aylesbury Vale District Council&#x27;s decision to grant planning permission to the developers was &quot;unimpeachable&quot; and legally sound.

Halabi&#x27;s property company, Buckingham Securities Holdings, was also proposing to develop the In &amp; Out Club at 79–81 Piccadilly, London, also known as Cambridge House and once occupied by Lord Palmerston before it became the Naval and Military Club. The intention was to turn both properties into Europe&#x27;s first six-star hotels, one located in town and the other to be the sister Country Manor hotel with a 36-hole private golf club. The original architects, EPR, were replaced by AFR in 2005, but the development stalled in 2007. In 2004, Hotel Design Inc were retained as interior designers for both projects, leading to a 2005 launch event for the marketing of the properties as a private members&#x27; club with hotel facilities (the PM Club).
The last proposal, after the sister Piccadilly property was sold to the Rueben Brothers in 2009, was to renovate the original Mentmore Towers building and not construct the new extension containing guest-room suites, conference facilities and a large spa. However, with Halabi&#x27;s property empire in serious trouble due to the housing market&#x27;s collapse, the project stalled, and the property was in decline. By April 2022, a report described it as &quot;abandoned&quot; and &quot;left to rot&quot;.

===&quot;At risk&quot; condition===
The house needs urgent work on the roof and chimneys. There is concern that weather will penetrate to the interiors, considered among the finest examples of Victorian design and craftsmanship in Britain. Historic England (previously English Heritage) has placed Mentmore Towers on the Heritage at Risk Register, listing it in &quot;poor&quot; condition with &quot;immediate risk of further rapid deterioration or loss of fabric&quot;, explaining that &quot;the service wing roof is in very poor condition and the deterioration of the main house is accelerating with areas of water ingress into the main hall and adjacent reception rooms&quot;. By 2022, the need for restoration was classified as priority A (up from priority B in 2016–2021). The report states &quot;immediate risk of further rapid deterioration or loss of fabric: no solution agreed&#x27; in spite of a restoration plan that had been previously completed&quot;.

A video published at the end of 2021 confirmed the extent of the deterioration.

On 3 May 2024 Thames Valley Police posted on their Facebook page, they had responded the previous night to report of 2 people breaking into Mentmore Towers, which is becoming a regular occurrence. Officers have been cracking down on this and responding swiftly to apprehend those involved.

==Golf courses==
Much of the historic estate was sold off in 1944 and reverted to agricultural use before becoming the Mentmore Golf and Country Club, established in 1992, which had two eighteen-hole golf courses designed by Bob Sandow, the Rothschild Course and the Rosebery Course. The club ceased trading in 2015.

==Film location==
The house has appeared in many films, including: &quot;Brazil&quot; (1985), &quot;Slipstream&quot; (1989), &quot;Incognito&quot; (1997), &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; (1999), &quot;Quills&quot; (2000), &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; (2001), &quot;Ali G Indahouse&quot; (2002), &quot;Johnny English&quot; (2003), &quot;Batman Begins&quot; (2005), and &quot;Infinite&quot; (2021). Mentmore Park also featured as a location in the &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; episode &quot;Cherubim and Seraphim&quot;.

In addition, it has been used as a location for music videos, including the Roxy Music video for &quot;Avalon&quot; (1982), &quot;Magic Touch&quot; by Mike Oldfield (1987), Enya&#x27;s &quot;Only If...&quot; (1997), &quot;Until the Time Is Through&quot; by Five (1998), &quot;What Is Love&quot; by Haddaway (1993), and &quot;Goodbye&quot; by the Spice Girls (1998).
