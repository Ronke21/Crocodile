<text>Roger Frederick Wicker (born July 5, 1951) is an American politician, attorney, and Air Force veteran serving as the senior United States senator from Mississippi, a seat he has held since 2007. A member of the Republican Party, Wicker was a Mississippi State Senator from 1988 to 1995 and the U.S. representative from Mississippi&#x27;s 1st congressional district from 1995 until 2007.

Born in Pontotoc, Mississippi, Wicker is a graduate of the University of Mississippi and the University of Mississippi School of Law. He was an officer in the United States Air Force from 1976 to 1980 and a member of the United States Air Force Reserves from 1980 to 2003. During the 1980s, he worked as a political counselor to then-Congressman Trent Lott on the House Rules Committee. In 1987, Wicker was elected to the Mississippi State Senate, representing the 6th district, which included Tupelo.

Wicker was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1994, succeeding retiring 27-term Democratic Congressman Jamie Whitten. Wicker served in the House from 1995 to 2007, when he was appointed to the Senate by Governor Haley Barbour to fill the seat vacated by Lott. Wicker subsequently won a special election for the remainder of the term in 2008 and was reelected to a full term in 2012. Wicker served as chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee from 2015 to 2017 and is a deputy Republican whip. He was reelected in 2018, defeating Democratic nominee David Baria. He was reelected again in 2024, defeating Democratic nominee Ty Pinkins.

Wicker serves on four committees in the 119th Congress: the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, the Environment and Public Works Committee, the Rules Committee, and the Senate Armed Services Committee, which he chairs.

==Early life and education==
Wicker was born on July 5, 1951, in Pontotoc, Mississippi, to Wordna Glen (n√©e Threadgill) and Thomas Frederick &quot;Fred&quot; Wicker, a lawyer and onetime Mississippi state senator. At age 16, Wicker worked as a United States House of Representatives page for Representative Jamie L. Whitten of . He graduated from Pontotoc High School in 1969.

Wicker attended the University of Mississippi, where he was a member of the Sigma Nu fraternity and student body president. He was inducted into Omicron Delta Kappa for his student leadership and academic merit. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in journalism and political science in 1973 and a J.D. degree in 1975 from the university.

After graduation, Wicker commissioned into the United States Air Force as a Judge Advocate from 1976 to 1980. Starting in 1980, he was a member of the Air Force Reserve; he retired from the reserve in 2003 as a lieutenant colonel.

==Early political career==

Wicker began his political career in 1980 as House Rules Committee counsel to U.S. Representative Trent Lott. He was elected to the Mississippi State Senate in 1987, spending $25,000 on the race. He represented the 6th district, which included Tupelo, from 1988 to 1994. He amended a 1994 state Medicaid bill to authorize the Mississippi Attorney General to contract private attorneys on contingency.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 1994, Jamie Whitten declined to seek reelection; he had represented the 1st District for 53 years, longer than any other congressman at the time. Wicker ran to succeed him, spending $750,000 on his campaign. He finished first in a crowded six-way Republican primary with 7,156 votes (26.62%) and proceeded to a runoff with attorney Grant Fox, who received 5,208 votes (19.37%). Former U.S. Attorney Bob Whitwell finished 600 votes short of the runoff with 4,606 votes (17.14%), 1992 nominee Clyde E. Whitaker came fourth with 4,602 votes (17.12%), 1986 nominee Larry Cobb came fifth with 4,162 votes (15.48%) and 1990 nominee Bill Bowlin took the remaining 1,147 votes (4.27%). In the runoff, Wicker defeated Fox, 11,905 votes (53.07%) to 10,527 (46.93%).

In the general election, Wicker defeated Fulton attorney Bill Wheeler, 80,553 votes (63.06%) to 47,192 (36.94%), making him the first Republican to represent the 1st district in over a century. This was not considered an upset, as the 1st has always been a rather conservative district (especially in the Memphis suburbs). The district had only supported the Democratic nominee for president once since 1956, when Jimmy Carter carried the district in 1976. Although Whitten had a nearly unbreakable hold on the district, it had been considered very likely that he would be succeeded by a Republican once he retired.

Wicker was reelected six times without serious difficulty, never receiving less than 65% of the vote. In 2004, he was unopposed by a Democratic candidate, facing only Reform Party nominee Barbara Dale Washer, whom he defeated by 219,328 votes (79.01%) to 58,256 (20.99%).

===Tenure===
Assuming office in 1995, Wicker was president of the freshman class, which included 53 other new Republican representatives, elected as part of the 1994 &quot;Republican Revolution&quot;.

Wicker was a member of the House Appropriations Committee. He was also deputy Republican whip.

In Congress, Wicker worked on issues related to medical research and on economic development for his home state. He advocated private-public partnerships to bring investment to rural areas. Wicker also worked for veterans&#x27; issues while serving as a member of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Subcommittee. In his final year as representative, Wicker topped the list in earmarks.

In 2007, Wicker was criticized after securing a $6 million earmark for a defense company whose executives had made significant contributions to his campaign.

At a press conference on December 31, 2007, Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour appointed Wicker to fill the Senate seat Lott vacated on December 18, 2007. He was sworn in by the Senate clerk just before that news conference.

===Elections===
;2008

Wicker ran for the remainder of Lott&#x27;s term in the November 2008 special election against Democrat Ronnie Musgrove, Barbour&#x27;s predecessor as governor. Wicker defeated Musgrove, 683,409 votes (54.96%) to 560,064 (45.04%).

;2012

Wicker ran for reelection to a full term in 2012. He was opposed by Robert Maloney and Tea Party activist E.

Wicker defeated Democratic nominee David Baria, a state legislator, with 58.5% of the vote.

;2024

Wicker defeated two opponents in the Republican primary with roughly 60% of the vote and Democratic nominee Ty Pinkins in the general election with 62.8% of the vote.

===Tenure===

On September 16, 2010, President Barack Obama announced his intent to nominate Wicker as representative of the United States to the Sixty-fifth Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.
In the Senate, Wicker is a member of the Senate Republicans&#x27; whip team and has repeatedly introduced a bill to overturn &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, the Supreme Court decision ruling abortion bans unconstitutional. Wicker called the Affordable Care Act the &quot;great fight for the rest of this term, maybe our lifetimes&quot; and later introduced a bill to enable state officials to challenge the law. In the interest of protecting gun owners, he amended a fiscal 2010 transportation spending bill to allow Amtrak passengers to carry firearms and ammunition in checked baggage.

Wicker and Representative Gene Taylor pushed amendments allowing purchasers of federal flood insurance to add wind coverage to their policies, helpful to a hurricane-prone state. As a member of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe (Helsinki Commission) monitoring human rights and other issues, in late 2012 Wicker worked with Senator Ben Cardin to enact a bill imposing penalties on Russians accused of violating human rights. The measure led Russian President Vladimir Putin to announce a subsequent ban on U.S. adoptions of Russian-born children.

Wicker was one of three politicians targeted during the April 2013 ricin letters bioterrorism attack. On April 16, 2013, a letter addressed to Wicker tested positive for the poison ricin as part of a series of letters. The letter was detected by postal officials and law enforcement and prevented from reaching the Capitol. The letter was tested three times, with each test confirming the presence of ricin.

In July 2013, Wicker proposed that the Senate meet to discuss a controversial change to filibuster rules. The Senate held the private meeting in the Old Senate chamber to discuss Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid&#x27;s threat of the so-called &quot;nuclear option&quot;, which would change the rules for Senate votes on Obama&#x27;s executive branch nominees. Wicker said he hoped the chamber&#x27;s bipartisan past could serve as an inspiration for the debate about the nuclear option: &quot;I think there are concessions that can be made on both sides. And then I would just hope that, institutionally, we can get away from this mindset.&quot;

Wicker supported the Bipartisan Sportsmen&#x27;s Act of 2014 (S. 2363; 113th Congress), a bill related to hunting, fishing, and outdoor recreation, aimed at improving &quot;the public&#x27;s ability to enjoy the outdoors.&quot; He said, &quot;Mississippians know the importance of efforts to preserve our natural resources for future generations.&quot;

Wicker was elected chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee for the 114th U.S. Congress on November 13, 2014.

Weeks after the 2014 Hong Kong class boycott campaign and Umbrella Movement broke out, demanding genuine universal suffrage among other goals, Wicker joined Senator Sherrod Brown and Representative Chris Smith&#x27;s effort to introduce the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which would update the United States‚ÄìHong Kong Policy Act of 1992 and U.S. commitment to Hong Kong&#x27;s freedom and democracy. &quot;U.S. should stand steadfast with the people of Hong Kong in their fight to exercise self-determination,&quot; Wicker said, and &quot;speak with a unified American voice in support of universal freedom and democratic values. The Congress and the Obama Administration should act to ensure China honors its longstanding obligation under international law to maintain Hong Kong&#x27;s autonomy.&quot;

In March 2017, Wicker co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (s. 720), which made it a federal crime for Americans to encourage or participate in boycotts against Israel and Israeli settlements in the West Bank if protesting actions by the Israeli government.

In May 2020, a group of Senate Republicans planned to introduce a privacy bill that would regulate the data collected by coronavirus contact tracing apps. The COVID-19 Consumer Data Protection Act would &quot;provide all Americans with more transparency, choice, and control over the collection and use of their personal health, geolocation, and proximity data&quot;, according to a joint statement. Wicker said the legislation also would &quot;hold businesses accountable to consumers if they use personal data to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.&quot; The act would permit the creation of &quot;platforms that could trace the virus and help flatten the curve and stop the spread ‚Äì and maintaining privacy protections for U.S. citizens&quot;, Wicker said.

In September 2020, less than two months before the next presidential election, Wicker supported an immediate Senate vote on Trump&#x27;s nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy caused by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg&#x27;s death, saying that Senate Republicans had &quot;promised to confirm well qualified, conservative judges&quot; and that there was a &quot;constitutional duty&quot; to fill vacancies. In March 2016, Wicker had taken the opposite position by declining to consider Obama&#x27;s Supreme Court nominee during a presidential election year, saying that the &quot;American people should have the opportunity to make their voices heard before filling a lifetime appointment to the nation‚Äôs highest court.&quot;

Wicker announced before the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count that he would vote to certify the election on January 6, 2021. He was participating in the certification when Trump supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol. When the Capitol was secure and Congress returned to complete the certification, Wicker voted to certify the count, with his senate counterpart, Cindy Hyde-Smith objecting to the count. In the wake of the violence and certification, Wicker called for perpetrators to be prosecuted &quot;to the fullest extent of the law&quot; and said, &quot;we must work together to rebuild confidence in our institutions.&quot; Wicker opposed Trump&#x27;s removal from office, encouraging a peaceful transfer of power on Inauguration Day.

In March 2021, after Congress passed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, Wicker highlighted on social media that the bill awarded $28.6 billion of &quot;targeted relief&quot; to &quot;independent restaurant operators&quot; to &quot;survive the pandemic&quot;. In that post, he neglected to mention that he had voted against the bill.

In August 2021, Wicker voted for the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

After President Joe Biden said that he planned to select a black woman to appoint to the Supreme Court in January 2022, Wicker told Mississippi radio host Paul Gallo that the nominee would be a &quot;beneficiary&quot; of an affirmative action &quot;quota&quot;, drawing a rebuke from the White House.

Wicker was one of 18 Republican senators to vote for the $1.7 trillion omnibus bill that President Donald Trump heavily criticized. He was among the 31 Senate Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023.

==Political positions==
The Heritage Foundation gave Wicker a lifetime conservative rating of 61% (the average Republican scored 79%). As of December 2017, Wicker ranks 14th of 98 in the &quot;Bipartisan Index&quot; compiled by The Lugar Center, which reflects a low level of partisanship. Wicker identifies as a fiscal conservative, but has voted to increase federal spending for agriculture, infrastructure, and military projects throughout Mississippi.

=== Foreign policy ===

As a U.S. representative, Wicker supported the Iraq War and called it just. He believed it was necessary to remove Saddam Hussein from power.

Wicker supported the 2001 United States invasion of Afghanistan and called the U.S. withdrawal in 2021 &quot;one of the biggest foreign policy catastrophes in my lifetime.‚Äù He also said, &quot;we were better off with a Korea-like presence&quot;. Afterward, he cosponsored legislation that would have ended official diplomatic relations with Afghanistan&#x27;s new Taliban government.

In December 2021, Wicker said the U.S. should consider a preemptive nuclear strike against Russia: &quot;we don&#x27;t rule out first-use nuclear action.&quot; He said this two months before the Russian invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. Wicker also supported implementing a no-fly zone over Ukraine in 2022, which the &quot;National Review&quot; called &quot;a very bad idea&quot;.

Wicker is an ardent Zionist and one of the most pro-Israel U.S. politicians. According to the American Jewish Congress, he &quot;opposed the Iran Deal and opposed UN Security Resolution 2334&quot;, which affirmed that Israel&#x27;s settlement activity violated international law. Wicker also voted for the Israel Anti-Boycott Act, supported the Anti-Semitism Awareness Act, and cosponsored the United States-Israel Security Authorization Act of 2018, which allocated military funding for Israel regardless of the Palestinian question. He opposed opening a U.S. Palestinian consulate in East Jerusalem, which would have answered to the U.S. Department of State. Wicker opposes any form of humanitarian aid to Palestinians during the Gaza war.

=== Refugees ===
Wicker strongly supports expanding U.S. visas for Ukrainian refugees. He previously opposed Mississippi accepting Syrian refugees who fled from war-torn Syria.

=== Ukraine ===
Wicker has been one of Ukraine&#x27;s strongest Republican supporters. He voted each time for aid to Ukraine. In a press release, Wicker wrote: &quot;President Reagan once called the Soviet Union &#x27;the focus of evil in the modern world.&#x27; After two months of unprovoked brutality, it is obvious that the Kremlin remains one of the chief forces for evil in our world.&quot;

On February 13, 2024, Wicker voted for Schumer&#x27;s bill to appropriate aid for Ukraine, Taiwan, and Israel. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; characterized this as deserting the Republican Party, when in reality the split was 22-28. On April 23, Wicker voted in favor of aid to Ukraine. It was remarked that &quot;Reagan Republicans&quot;, including Wicker, Mitch McConnell, and House Speaker Mike Johnson, had split from Trump, at the time the presumptive Republican nominee.

In May 2024, Wicker, John Thune, and John Cornyn urged Speaker Johnson not to agree to anything with Marjorie Taylor Greene, who was plotting to oust him, in order to save his position.

=== Mississippi flag ===
From 2015 until it was finally changed in 2020, Wicker sought to change the Mississippi flag, calling it offensive to many of his &quot;fellow citizens&quot;. 64% of Mississippians voted to keep the flag in a 2001 referendum. Wicker supported nullifying that vote in 2020 and replacing the flag without a new referendum.

=== Confederacy ===
While discussing Mississippi&#x27;s previous state flag, Wicker said his Confederate military ancestors were &quot;Americans&quot; and &quot;brave&quot;.

===Climate change===
In 2015, Wicker was the only U.S. senator to vote against an amendment declaring that climate change is real. The final vote was 98 to 1, with Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic leader from Nevada, not voting. The amendment affirmed that &quot;climate change is real and not a hoax.&quot;

In 2017, Wicker was one of 22 senators to sign a letter to President Trump urging him to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement. According to OpenSecrets, Wicker has received over $200,000 from the oil and gas industry since 2012.

In November 2023, Wicker initially supported the Foreign Pollution Fee Act co-sponsored by Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy. Endorsed by the Sierra Club, the bill (S. 3198; referred to the Senate Finance Committee) proposed imposing a carbon tariff on energy and industrial imports based on the good&#x27;s emission intensity or carbon footprint as compared with the same domestic good to impose a carbon price on goods from countries with greater greenhouse gas emissions than the United States. Wicker subsequently withdrew co-sponsorship of the bill.

===Gun law===
Wicker&#x27;s support for pro-gun legislation and gun rights has earned him an A+ rating from the NRA Political Victory Fund (NRA-PVF). The NRA-PVF endorsed Wicker during the 2012 election. Wicker has said that he will filibuster any bill that he feels &quot;infringes&quot; on the Second Amendment, including weapon bans. He has received $21,350 in funding from gun lobbyists for his political activities.

In 2009, Wicker introduced a bill allowing Amtrak passengers to check unloaded and locked handguns in their luggage. The law passed 68‚Äì30. His rationale for the bill was that people&#x27;s Second Amendment rights were violated on a federally subsidized train system if they could not bring their guns.

One day after the 2015 San Bernardino attack, Wicker voted against a bill, co-sponsored by a Democrat and a Republican, that would make background checks mandatory when a person buys a gun. He said he voted against it because he feared it would have &quot;opened the door to a national gun registry.&quot;

In 2017, Wicker voted in favor of &quot;a joint resolution of disapproval aimed at former President Obama&#x27;s executive action requiring the Social Security Administration (SSA) place beneficiaries on the National Instant Criminal Background Check System &#x27;mental defective&#x27; list.&quot;

===Secularism===
Wicker asked the United States Navy to deny the admission of a secular humanist to the Chaplain Corps, saying, &quot;It is troubling that the Navy could allow a self-avowed atheist to serve in the Chaplain Corps.&quot;

===January 6 commission===
On May 28, 2021, Wicker voted against creating an independent commission to investigate the January 6 United States Capitol attack.

==Political ratings==
In 2020, Wicker received a score of 74 from the American Conservative Union. He has a lifetime rating of 83.62.

==Personal life==
Wicker has been married to Gayle Long since 1975. They have three children and six grandchildren. The Wickers reside in Tupelo, where Wicker is a deacon and a member of the First Baptist Church Tupelo choir.

He previously served on the Board of Advisors for the , a nongovernmental organization that works in crisis areas.

<text>Rubus idaeus (raspberry, also called red raspberry or occasionally European red raspberry to distinguish it from other raspberry species) is a red-fruited species of &quot;Rubus&quot; native to Europe and northern Asia and commonly cultivated in other temperate regions.

==Taxonomy==
A closely related plant in North America, sometimes regarded as the variety &quot;Rubus idaeus&quot; var. &quot;strigosus&quot;, is more commonly treated as a distinct species, &quot;Rubus strigosus&quot; (American red raspberry), as is done here. Red-fruited cultivated raspberries, even in North America, are generally &quot;Rubus idaeus&quot; or horticultural derivatives of hybrids of &quot;R. idaeus&quot; and &quot;R. strigosus;&quot; these plants are all addressed in the present article.

==Description==
Plants of &quot;Rubus idaeus&quot; are generally perennials, which bear biennial stems (&quot;canes&quot;) from a perennial root system. In its first year, a new, unbranched stem (&quot;primocane&quot;) grows vigorously to its full height of 1.5‚Äì2.5 m (5.0‚Äì8.3 feet), bearing large pinnately compound leaves with five or seven leaflets, but usually no flowers. In its second year (as a &quot;floricane&quot;), a stem does not grow taller, but produces several side shoots, which bear smaller leaves with three or five leaflets. The flowers are produced in late spring on short racemes on the tips of these side shoots, each flower about 1¬†cm (0.4 inches) diameter with five white petals. The fruit is red, edible, and sweet but tart-flavoured, produced in summer or early autumn; in botanical terminology, it is not a berry at all, but an aggregate fruit of numerous drupelets around a central core. In raspberries (various species of &quot;Rubus&quot; subgenus &quot;Idaeobatus&quot;), the drupelets separate from the core when picked, leaving a hollow fruit, whereas in blackberries and most other species of &quot;Rubus,&quot; the drupelets stay attached to the core.
==Biotope==
As a wild plant, &quot;R. idaeus&quot; typically grows in forests, forming open stands under a tree canopy, and denser stands in clearings. In the south of its range (southern Europe and central Asia), it occurs only at high altitudes in mountains. The species name &quot;idaeus&quot; refers to its occurrence on Mount Ida near Troy in northwest Turkey, where the ancient Greeks were most familiar with it.

==Cultivation and uses==
&quot;R. idaeus&quot; is grown primarily for its fruits, but occasionally for its leaves, roots, or other parts.

===Fruits===

The fruit of &quot;R. idaeus&quot; is an important food crop, though most modern commercial raspberry cultivars derive from hybrids between &quot;R. idaeus&quot; and &quot;R. strigosus&quot;. The fruits of wild plants have a sweet taste and are very aromatic.

===Leaves and other parts===

Red raspberries contains 31 Œºg/100 g of folate. Red raspberries have antioxidant effects that play a minor role in the killing of stomach and colon cancer cells.

Young roots of &quot;Rubus idaeus&quot; prevented kidney stone formation in a mouse model of hyperoxaluria. Tiliroside from raspberry is a potent tyrosinase inhibitor and might be used as a skin-whitening agent and pigmentation medicine.

Raspberry fruit may protect the liver.

==Chemistry==
Vitamin C and phenolics are present in red raspberries. Most notably, the anthocyanins cyanidin-3-sophoroside, cyanidin-3-(2(G)-glucosylrutinoside) and cyanidin-3-glucoside, the two ellagitannins sanguiin H-6 and lambertianin C are present together with trace levels of flavonols, ellagic acid and hydroxycinnamate.

Polyphenolic compounds from raspberry seeds have antioxidant effects in vitro, but have no proven antioxidant effect in humans. Raspberry ketones are derived from various fruits and plants, not raspberries, and are marketed as having weight loss benefits. There is no clinical evidence for this effect in humans.

<text>Pamela Beryl Harriman (&quot;n√©e&quot; Digby; March 20, 1920 ‚Äì February 5, 1997), also known as Pamela Churchill Harriman, was an English political activist for the Democratic Party, diplomat, and socialite. She married three times: her first husband was Randolph Churchill, the son of prime minister Winston Churchill; her third husband was W. Averell Harriman, an American diplomat who also served as Governor of New York. Her only child, Winston Churchill (1940‚Äì2010), was named after his famous grandfather. She served as US ambassador to France from 1993 until her death in 1997.

==Early life==
Pamela Digby was born in Farnborough, Hampshire, England, the daughter of Edward Digby, 11th Baron Digby, and his wife, Constance Pamela Alice, the daughter of Henry Campbell Bruce, 2nd Baron Aberdare. She was educated by governesses in the ancestral home at Minterne Magna in Dorset, along with her three younger siblings, and later attended Downham School. Her great-great aunt was the nineteenth-century adventurer and courtesan Jane Digby (1807‚Äì1881), notorious for her exotic travels and scandalous personal life. Pamela was to follow in her relative&#x27;s footsteps, and has been called &quot;the 20th-century&#x27;s most influential courtesan&quot;.

Raised amid acres of Dorset farmland and woods, from an early age she was a very good horsewoman. She competed at shows at the International Olympia, Royal Bath and West Show, and local shows at Dorchester and Melplash. She show-jumped a tiny pony called Stardust that did a clear round at Olympia when every fence was above the animal&#x27;s withers.

At the age of seventeen, she was sent to a Munich boarding school for six months. While there she was introduced to Adolf Hitler by Unity Mitford. She subsequently went to Paris, taking some classes at the Sorbonne. Although in her &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; biography she identified these classes as &quot;post-graduate&quot; work, she actually never completed a university degree. By 1937, she had returned to Britain.

She was a descendant of the Earls of Leicester and Ilchester and the Dukes of Atholl. She was a first cousin of Lavinia Fitzalan-Howard, Duchess of Norfolk, a third cousin, once removed, of Angus Ogilvy, husband of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s cousin, Alexandra of Kent and a fourth cousin, once removed, of Sarah, Duchess of York.

==Personal life==
===Marriage to Randolph Churchill===
In 1939, while working at the Foreign Office in London doing French-to-English translations, the 19-year-old Pamela met Randolph Churchill, the son of Winston Churchill, who according to British writer Sonia Purnell was, &quot;a womaniser and alcoholic, desperate for a wife having already proposed to eight women in the space of two weeks&quot;. Randolph proposed to her on the very evening they met, and they were married on 4 October 1939. Two days after Randolph Churchill took his seat in the House of Commons, their son Winston was born. Shortly after giving birth, Pamela and the newborn were photographed by Cecil Beaton for &quot;Life&quot; magazine, its first cover of a mother with baby.

In February 1941, Randolph was sent to Cairo with the British Commandos, acquiring gambling debts during the boat journey. Pamela was left to cope alone with a young baby and Randolph&#x27;s creditors. His letter to Pamela asking her to make good on new gambling debt of $12,000 (equivalent to over $190,000 in 2020) forced her to take a ¬£12-a-week job at the Ministry of Supply and sell her wedding presents and much of her jewellery, while keeping it a secret from her in-laws. She fell in love and started an affair with American envoy Averell Harriman, who was married and almost 30 years her senior. 
She filed for divorce in December 1945 on the grounds that Churchill had deserted her for three years. Later, after having converted to Catholicism, she obtained an annulment from the Catholic Church.

===Romantic involvements and affairs===
Besides two additional marriages, Churchill had numerous affairs with men of prominence and wealth. When her marriage to Randolph Churchill started to fall apart, she became romantically involved with Averell Harriman, who later became her third husband; Edward R. Murrow; and John Hay &quot;Jock&quot; Whitney. After her divorce from Churchill she was involved with Prince Aly Khan, Alfonso de Portago, Gianni Agnelli, and Baron Elie de Rothschild.

According to American author Michael Gross, Churchill became well known for her attention to detail with men. William S. Paley, briefly a consort during WWII, said: &quot;She is the greatest courtesan of the century&quot;, meaning it as a compliment. The more critical Max Hastings said, acerbically, &quot;she was¬†... described as having become &#x27;a world expert on rich men&#x27;s bedroom ceilings&#x27;.&quot;

In 1948, Harriman moved to Paris and began a five-year-long romance with Gianni Agnelli, a noted playboy and heir to the Fiat empire, who was a year younger than she was. She described this as the happiest period of her life. In August 1952, she walked in on him embracing a young woman, Anne-Marie d&#x27;Estainville, at a party. Later that night Agnelli sustained a severe leg injury in a car accident while taking d&#x27;Estainville home. By Pamela&#x27;s account, she nursed him back to health while he was in the hospital, then while he was convalescing in Turin they decided together to end their relationship.

Her next significant relationship was with Baron de Rothschild, who was married. He supported her financially, and she was schooled in art history and wine-making during this clandestine and short relationship. During this time she also had affairs with the writer Maurice Druon and with the shipping magnate Stavros Niarchos.

===Marriage to Leland Hayward===
In 1959, she met Broadway producer Leland Hayward, who was still married to Slim Hawks. He proposed to her, and after her marriage ultimatum to Rothschild was rejected, she accepted Hayward&#x27;s offer and moved to New York City. The day Hayward&#x27;s divorce was final, she became the fifth Mrs. Hayward with the ceremony taking place in Carson City, Nevada, on May 4, 1960. Hayward was rich with income from his productions, notably the very successful &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, allowing for a luxurious lifestyle mostly between their residence in New York City and the Westchester County estate &quot;Haywire.&quot; &quot;Haywire&quot; also became the name of the memoirs of her stepdaughter Brooke Hayward. Her step granddaughter through Brooke was Marin Hopper. Pamela Hayward stayed with her husband until his death on March 18, 1971.

===Marriage to W. Averell Harriman===
The day after Hayward&#x27;s funeral, Pamela arranged to resume her acquaintance with her former lover, Harriman, then 79 years old and recently widowed. They were married on September 27, 1971. With this marriage, her social focus was moved to Washington, D.C., where he owned a townhouse in Georgetown from which they entertained many notable people. Harriman, a railroad heir, was wealthy and also bought an estate in Virginia and a private jet. With Harriman&#x27;s involvement and links in the Democratic Party, her political career began. Her last marriage lasted until his death in 1986. In later years, she had many legal problems with Harriman&#x27;s children concerning the inheritance.

Pamela Harriman served on The Rockefeller University Council from 1977 to 1979, and on the Board of Trustees from 1979 to 1993. She also served on the Board of Visitors of the College of William and Mary from 1986‚Äì1990 where she established The Pamela Harriman Professorship of Government and Public Policy and sponsored a scholarship in her name for three students to serve each summer at the US Embassy to France.

==Political life==
As Pamela Churchill Harriman she became a United States citizen in 1971 and became involved with the Democratic Party, creating a fund-raising system‚Äîa political action committee‚Äînamed &quot;Democrats for the 80s&quot;, later &quot;Democrats for the 90s&quot;, and nicknamed &quot;PamPAC&quot;. In 1980, the Woman&#x27;s National Democratic Club named her &quot;Woman of the Year.&quot; U.S. President Bill Clinton appointed her United States Ambassador to France in 1993. The Dayton Agreement was signed in Paris in 1995 while she served as ambassador.

==Death==

Pamela Harriman died on February 5, 1997 at the American Hospital, Neuilly-sur-Seine, after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage while swimming at the Paris Ritz one day earlier. The morning after her death, President Jacques Chirac of France placed the Grand Cross of the L√©gion d&#x27;honneur on her flag-draped coffin. She was the first female foreign diplomat to receive this honor. United States President Bill Clinton, in further recognition of her contributions and significance, dispatched Air Force One to return her body to the USA and spoke at her funeral at the Washington National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., mentioning her public service in glowing terms. Harriman was buried February 14, 1997, at Arden, the former Harriman estate in New York.

== In popular culture ==
Harriman&#x27;s life story has been the subject of several films and novels, including the following:
*In the 2000 biography of Madeleine Albright, Pamela Harriman is cited in contrast to Albright, as a socialite who slept her way to the top.
*In the 2015 two-character play, &quot;Swimming at The Ritz&quot; by Charles Leipart, Pamela Harriman, in need of $40¬†million to settle a family lawsuit, regales the audience with tales from her past. She and a hotel valet wait in a Paris Ritz suite for appraisers from Christie&#x27;s who are preparing to auction her possessions.
*A 2020 book about Winston Churchill during The Blitz, &quot;The Splendid and the Vile&quot; by Erik Larson, details Pamela&#x27;s married life with Randolph Churchill, with whom she had Winston Churchill&#x27;s near-namesake grandson, Winston Spencer-Churchill. The book details the devastating toll Randolph&#x27;s compulsive gambling took on their marriage and concludes with her love affair with Averell Harriman along with their eventual marriage decades later.

<text>The Groninger or Groningen is a Dutch horse breed developed for light draft and agricultural work. It is closely related to heavy warmblood breeds like the East Friesian and Alt-Oldenburger. The breed was nearly lost in the mid-20th century because a significant number of mares were used for crossbreeding to create the Dutch Warmblood, leaving few purebreds.

==History==

===Foundation===
The Groninger shares much of its initial foundation with the Friesian, East Friesian and Alt-Oldenburger, and Holsteiner: small native farm horses and medieval destriers were influenced by popular Spanish, Neapolitan, and Arabian horses in the 17th and 18th centuries. Horses like England&#x27;s Cleveland Bay were also utilized, producing a horse that was tall by the standards of the day, as well as reasonably elegant with deep, wide haunches and a thick, high-set neck.

Although selection procedures had been in use for many years, the first Dutch horse registries weren&#x27;t founded until the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The North-Netherlands Warmblood Horse Studbook, or NWP, regulated horse breeding in Groningen, Friesland, and Drenthe, while the NSTg did the same for the southern regions, including Gelderland. The goals of the registries were characterized by distinct differences in the soil composition: Groningen had heavy, wet, clay soil and needed a particularly stout horse to till it, while the soil in Gelderland was sandier.

Nevertheless, both studbooks aimed to produce a horse that could perform farm work, retaining as much elegance as possible to make them attractive carriage horses. This goal echoed that of neighboring East Frisia and Oldenburg, regions with which breeding stock were freely exchanged. The NWP also utilized Holsteiners, which were rumored to have been influenced by the horses of Dutch immigrants. In reality, all parts of the region known as Frisia have ties beyond the similarity of their soil and weather.

The result of these exchanges was that at the turn of the century, the Groninger, East Friesian, Oldenburger, and Holsteiner were calm, substantial farm and carriage horses with primarily dark coats.

In the 1920s and 30&#x27;s, horses were bred to be rather heavier, fulfilling the roles of tractor horse and artillery horse, though the lighter &quot;Karossier&quot; type was still present in all populations.

===Decline===
Following the wars, the breeding of heavy agricultural horses collapsed, and the breeders had to adapt. In 1964, the southern studbook opened a &quot;Sportregister&quot; with the aim of producing riding horses, and in 1969 the NWP and southern studbook merged to form the KWPN, the Royal Warmblood Horse Studbook of the Netherlands. There was a studbook for riding horses, a studbook for driving horses, and a studbook for Gelderlanders. All of the Groninger stallions lost their breeding approval, and mare owners were encouraged to breed them to foreign stallions. The breed was sure to disappear.

===Preservation===
In 1978, the last remaining NWP Groninger stallion, Baldewijn, was saved from the butcher. A small group of interested breeders pooled their genetic resources ‚Äì 20 mares and Baldewijn ‚Äì and in 1982 formed a private association. In 1985 this association, called simply &quot;The Groningen Horse&quot;, was recognized by Royal Decree and by the European Union 10 years later.

Alt-Oldenburg/East Friesian, Silesian, East-German, and Holsteiner horses of the appropriate type were used to re-establish the Groninger, as well as one Cleveland Bay stallion.
Today there are 25 approved stallions and over 400 mares.

==Characteristics==
The breed standard calls for a correct horse; heavy, with the legs about half the horse&#x27;s height, and a rectangular frame, with the body from point-of-shoulder to point-of-buttock about 10% greater than the height of the horse at the withers. The topline is level, muscular neck set on fairly high, and the loins and haunches are broad and powerful. The head is workman-like and the hooves large and sound. Ideal height is between 15.3 and 16.1 hands high at the withers.

In motion, the walk is diligent with a long stride, the trot is brisk and economical with some action, and the canter is of sufficient quality. The canter was not of great importance to the breeders, who did not have need for a heavy galloping horse, and so this gait is not as strong or expressive as the trot.

The horses are known for their even temperaments, though they are seldom spiritless. They are described as &quot;sober&quot; with a tremendous work ethic.
Dark colors predominate: almost 90% are black or some shade of bay. A small percentage are chestnut or grey, and there are strains known for the sabino or tobiano pattern though minimally-marked horses are favored. Photographs and records show that silver dapple coloring was present as well, though it is not known if any examples of this color have survived to modern day.

The Groninger is typically shown in a white bridle without a cavesson, traditionally braided with contrasting white and green ribbons. Fillies are named as the breeder desires, while colts are named patrilineally (e.g. Batavier by Bazalt).

==Uses==
The Groninger is, above all &quot;a family horse&quot;. Their calm nature and low-maintenance constitutions make them ideal horses for leisure. They are quick to mature, sound, long-lived and easy keepers, and do not need to be worked every day to be enjoyed.

Some, including approved stallions, compete in dressage at the Dutch national Z-level (about USDF 4th level) or higher, and some compete in show jumping above 4 feet as well, though this is less common.
They have found their modern niche as combined driving horses, a sport in which many, including the stallion Meinhold, compete internationally.

==Medical issues==
The greatest concern for the breed is inbreeding. As in other warmblood registries, stallions must undergo a veterinary examination before they are allowed to breed. In consequence, the breed is sound, long-lived, and thrifty.

<doc id="417450" wikidata="Q15699806" url="?curid=417450" title="Rubus plicatus">
<text>Rubus plicatus is a species of blackberry native to Europe.

==Taxonomy==
The type specimen of the genus &quot;Rubus&quot; was selected from among Linnaeus&#x27;s specimens by Nathaniel Lord Britton and Addison Brown in 1913 as a herbarium specimen labelled &quot;Rubus fruticosus&quot;. This specimen turned out to include a mixture of pieces that apparently belong to &quot;Rubus plicatus&quot; and &quot;Rubus ulmifolius&quot;. From these, a component that appears to match &quot;Rubus plicatus&quot; was selected to be the type. The type of &quot;Rubus plicatus&quot;, however, is a different specimen (which permits an individual botanist to decide that &quot;R. plicatus&quot; and &quot;R. fruticosus&quot; are not the same species). Whenever &quot;R. fruticosus&quot; and &quot;R. plicatus&quot; are considered to belong to the same species, the name &quot;Rubus fruticosus&quot; has priority. When one must be listed as a synonym of the other, &quot;R. fruticosus&quot; is usually considered to be a synonym of the later name &quot;Rubus plicatus&quot;, although strictly speaking that choice is contrary to the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants.

<doc id="417452" wikidata="Q337552" url="?curid=417452" title="Derek Conway">
<text>Derek Leslie Conway TD (born 15 February 1953) is an English politician and television presenter. A member of the Conservative Party, Conway served as a Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of Shrewsbury and Atcham from 1983 to 1997, and Old Bexley and Sidcup from 2001 to 2010. He is currently a presenter of &quot;Epilogue&quot;, a book review programme on Press TV, an English-language international television news channel funded by the Iranian government.

In January 2008, Conway announced that he would stand down at the next general election after a Commons standards committee found that he had employed his son Freddie, a full-time student at Newcastle University, as a political researcher using public funds, despite there being no record of his son doing any work at Westminster. As a result, Conservative Party leader David Cameron withdrew the whip from Conway, effectively expelling him from the Parliamentary Conservative group. He received considerable criticism from the press concerning the misuse of funds.

==Early life==
Conway was born in Gateshead and was educated at Beacon Hill Comprehensive School in the town, Gateshead Technical College, and Newcastle upon Tyne Polytechnic.

In 1974, at the age of 21, Conway was elected as a councillor of the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead council. In 1977, he was also elected to the Tyne and Wear County Council, and was the Conservative group leader from 1979 until 1982. He stepped down from the county council in 1983, when he was elected to Westminster. At Gateshead he was the Deputy Conservative Group Leader for some years and remained a councillor there until 1987, whilst simultaneously a Member of Parliament.

At the October 1974 general election he unsuccessfully contested the safe Labour parliamentary constituency of Durham, being defeated by the sitting member, Mark Hughes, by 18,116 votes. At the 1979 general election Conway contested the more marginal seat of Newcastle upon Tyne East and was again defeated, this time by Labour&#x27;s Mike Thomas and by 6,176 votes.

==Member of Parliament for Shrewsbury and Atcham==
Conway was first elected to parliament for Shrewsbury and Atcham at the 1983 general election, following the retirement of the long serving Conservative member for Shrewsbury, John Langford-Holt, securing a majority of 8,624.

In 1985, Conway became a member of the Agriculture Select committee, and after the 1987 general election he joined the Transport Select Committee. In 1988 he was appointed as the Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Minister of State at the Wales Office, Wyn Roberts, serving until 1991.

Following the 1992 general election Conway became the PPS to Michael Forsyth, Minister of State at the Department for Employment. In 1993 Conway was promoted by John Major to serve as an Assistant Government Whip, the next year becoming a Lord Commissioner to the Treasury, or &#x27;full whip&#x27;. He was again promoted within the Whips&#x27; Office when he became the Vice Chamberlain of HM Household in 1996.

Conway held the Shrewsbury and Atcham seat until he was defeated at the 1997 general election, when the Conservative Party nationally lost more than half of the seats it had held before the election. He was beaten by Labour&#x27;s Paul Marsden, whose majority was 1,670.

In his book titled &quot;The Political Animal&quot;, Jeremy Paxman recounts Conway&#x27;s reflections on his defeat: &quot;&#x27;Had it not been for James Goldsmith&#x27;s intervention I&#x27;d have won. He died of pancreatic cancer,&#x27; he [Conway] says, and then adds in the most chilling tone, &#x27;I hear it&#x27;s the most painful of deaths. I&#x27;m so pleased.&#x27;&quot;, although the number of votes by Goldsmith&#x27;s Referendum Party was underneath Labour&#x27;s majority in 1997, meaning Conway would have still lost the seat by several hundred votes if there had been no candidate from the party.

After his defeat Conway became the chief executive at the Cats Protection charity in 1998.

==Old Bexley and Sidcup==
Conway was out of the Commons until the general election, 2001 when he was elected as the member of parliament for the south London seat of Old Bexley and Sidcup, previously held by the former Prime Minister and Father of the House of Commons, Edward Heath. Conway defended Heath against accusations of homosexual behaviour.

He retained the seat with a majority of 3,345 in 2005. From his re-election he was a member of the Defence Select Committee. He is a Eurosceptic (even voting against the Single European Act that had the backing of Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government), and supports the return of capital punishment.

===Investigation and withdrawal of whip===
Conway employed his son Freddie as a part-time researcher, while Freddie was on a full-time degree course at the University of Newcastle. Conway paid his son the part-time equivalent of a ¬£25,970 salary, amounting to a sum in excess of ¬£40,000 over three years, including pension contributions.

Conway was reported to the Committee on Standards and Privileges by former Metropolitan Police Inspector Michael Barnbrook, who had stood against him in the 2005 general election as a UKIP candidate. After an investigation, in January 2008 the Committee found there was &quot;no record&quot; of what work Freddie had done, and said the ¬£1,000-plus a month he was paid was too high. They recommended that the House order him to repay a sum of ¬£13,000 and that he be suspended for 10 sitting days. However, in a subsequent interview with the &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot;, Derek Conway disputed the allegation that Freddie Conway had rarely travelled from Newcastle to Westminster, instead stating that Freddie &quot;would go up and down like a fiddler&#x27;s elbow&quot;. 
In light of the evidence, Conservative party leader David Cameron decided to withdraw the Conservative Party Whip, rendering Conway free of any Parliamentary Conservative constraints, effectively leaving him as an independent MP.

Conway announced on 30 January 2008 that he would not fight the next general election, stating: &quot;I have concluded that it&#x27;s now time to step down.&quot; He declared that he did not wish his &quot;personal circumstances to be a distraction&quot; from David Cameron&#x27;s leadership.

The ruling did not involve the elder son, Henry Conway, as he was not the subject of the original complaint, but John Lyon, who had recently taken on the post of Parliamentary commissioner for standards, received complaints about similar payments to Henry while he was also a student and doing the &quot;job&quot; which Freddie took over. Lyon decided a complaint from Duncan Borrowman merited investigation.
On 29 January 2009, almost a year after the previous report, a further report was published by the House of Commons Standards and Privileges Committee into the employment of Mr Conway&#x27;s elder son Henry. There was some evidence of Henry working for his salary, but his father was ordered to pay back ¬£3,758 which had been overpaid and to write a letter of apology to the chairman of the committee.

On 2 February 2009, Conway apologised in the House of Commons. Conway told the Commons he accepted &quot;without any reservation&quot; that he had breached the rules of the House. He withdrew comments made previously in which he accused Labour of using his story to deflect attention from the row over money paid to peers.

In May 2009 as part of its Disclosure of expenses of British Members of Parliament, the &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot; revealed that Conway had claimed the Second Home Allowance on a house in Northumberland 330 miles from his constituency.

==After parliament==
Conway is currently a presenter of &quot;Epilogue&quot;, a book review programme on Press TV, an English-language international television news channel funded by the Iranian government. In Jeremy Paxman&#x27;s book &quot;The Political Animal&quot; (2002) Conway is quoted as saying &quot;I miss the pressures. I love living on the edge&quot;.

==Personal life==
Conway has been married to Colette Elizabeth Mary Lamb since 1980 and they have two sons and a daughter.

Conway was commissioned into the 6th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Fusiliers (Territorial Army) in 1977. He was promoted lieutenant in 1979 and captain in 1981. In 1982 he transferred to 5th Battalion, The Light Infantry. He was promoted major in 1987, was awarded the Territorial Decoration in 1990 and transferred to the Reserve in 1994. He has also been an executive for Granada Television, a Sunday school teacher and a charity organiser for the National Fund for Research into Crippling Diseases (1974‚Äì1983) and the Cats Protection League (chief executive from 1998 to 2003). He is a Freeman of the City of London.

<text>The Chicago school (sometimes known as the ecological school) refers to a school of thought in sociology and criminology originating at the University of Chicago whose work was influential in the early 20th century.

Conceived in 1892, the Chicago school first rose to international prominence as the epicenter of advanced sociological thought between 1915 and 1935, when their work would be the first major bodies of research to specialize in urban sociology. This was considered the Golden Age of Sociology, with influence on many of today&#x27;s well known sociologists. Their research into the urban environment of Chicago would also be influential in combining theory and ethnographic fieldwork.

Major figures within the first Chicago school included Nels Anderson, Ernest Burgess, Ruth Shonle Cavan, Edward Franklin Frazier, Everett Hughes, Roderick D. McKenzie, George Herbert Mead, Robert E. Park, Walter C. Reckless, Edwin Sutherland, W. I. Thomas, Frederic Thrasher, Louis Wirth, and Florian Znaniecki. The activist, social scientist, and Nobel Peace Prize winner Jane Addams also forged and maintained close ties with some of the members of the school.

Following the Second World War, a &quot;second Chicago School&quot; arose, whose members combined symbolic interactionism with methods of field research (today known as ethnography), to create a new body of work. Luminaries from the second Chicago school include, Howard S. Becker, Richard Cloward, Erving Goffman, David Matza, Robert K. Merton, Lloyd Ohlin and Frances Fox Piven.

==Theory and method==
The Chicago school is best known for its urban sociology and for the development of the symbolic interactionist approach, notably through the work of Herbert Blumer. It has focused on human behavior as shaped by social structures and physical environmental factors, rather than genetic and personal characteristics. Biologists and anthropologists had accepted the theory of evolution as demonstrating that animals adapt to their environments. As applied to humans who are considered responsible for their own destinies, members of the school believed that the natural environment, which the community inhabits, is a major factor in shaping human behavior, and that the city functions as a microcosm: &quot;In these great cities, where all the passions, all the energies of mankind are released, we are in a position to investigate the process of civilization, as it were, under a microscope.&quot;

Members of the school have concentrated on the city of Chicago as the object of their study, seeking evidence whether urbanization and increasing social mobility have been the causes of the contemporary social problems. By 1910, the population exceeded two million, many of whom were recent immigrants to the U.S. With a shortage in housing and a lack of regulation in the burgeoning factories, the city&#x27;s residents experienced homelessness and poor housing, living, and working conditions with low wages, long hours, and excessive pollution. In their analysis of the situation, Thomas and Znaniecki (1918) argued that these immigrants, released from the controls of Europe to the unrestrained competition of the new city, contributed to the city&#x27;s dynamic growth.

Like the person who is born, grows, matures, and dies, the community continues to grow and exhibits properties of all of the individuals who had lived in the community.Ecological studies (among sociologists thus) consisted of making spot maps of Chicago for the place of occurrence of specific behaviors, including alcoholism, homicide, suicides, psychoses, and poverty, and then computing rates based on census data. A visual comparison of the maps could identify the concentration of certain types of behavior in some areas. Correlations of rates by areas were not made until later.For W. I. Thomas, the groups themselves had to reinscribe and reconstruct themselves to prosper. Burgess studied the history of development and concluded that the city had not grown at the edges. Although the presence of Lake Michigan prevented the complete encirclement, he postulated that all major cities would be formed by radial expansion from the center in concentric rings which he described as zones, i.e. the business area in the center; the slum area (aka &quot;the zone in transition&quot;) around the central area; the zone of workingmen&#x27;s homes farther out; the residential area beyond this zone; and then the bungalow section and the commuter&#x27;s zone on the periphery. Under the influence of Albion Small, the research at the school mined the mass of official data including census reports, housing/welfare records and crime figures, and related the data spatially to different geographical areas of the city. Criminologists Shaw and McKay created statistical maps:

*spot maps to demonstrate the location of a range of social problems with a primary focus on juvenile delinquency;
*rate maps which divided the city into block of one square mile and showed the population by age, gender, ethnicity, etc.;
*zone maps which demonstrated that the major problems were clustered in the city center.

Thomas also developed techniques of self-reporting life histories to provide subjective balance to the analysis. Park, Burgess, and McKenzie (1925) are
credited with institutionalizing, if not establishing, sociology as a science. They are also criticized for their overly empiricist and idealized approach to the study of society but, in the inter-war years, their attitudes and prejudices were normative. Three broad themes characterized this dynamic period of Chicago studies:

#Culture contact and conflict: Studies how ethnic groups interact and compete in a process of community succession and institutional transformation. An important part of this work concerned African Americans; the work of E. Franklin Frazier (1932; 1932), as well as of Drake and Cayton (1945), shaped white America&#x27;s perception of black communities for decades.
#Succession in community institutions as stakeholders and actors in the ebb and flow of ethnic groups. Cressey (1932) studied the dance hall and commercialized entertainment services; Kincheloe (1938) studied church succession; Janowitz (1952) studied the community press; and Hughes (1979) studied the real-estate board.
#City politics: Charles Edward Merriam&#x27;s commitment to practical reform politics was matched by Harold Gosnell (1927) who researched voting and other forms of participation. Gosnell (1935), Wilson (1960), Grimshaw (1992) considered African American politics; and Banfield and Wilson (1963) placed Chicago city politics in a broader context.

The school is perhaps best known for the subcultural theories of Thrasher (1927), Frazier (1932; 1932), and Sutherland (1924), and for applying the principles of ecology to develop the social disorganization theory which refers to consequences of the failure of:
*social institutions or social organizations (including the family, schools, churches, political institutions, policing, business, etc.) in identified communities and/or neighborhoods, or in society at large; and
*social relationships that traditionally encourage co-operation between people.

Thomas defined social disorganization as &quot;the inability of a neighborhood to solve its problems together&quot; which suggested a level of social pathology and personal disorganization, so the term, &quot;differential social organization&quot; was preferred by many, and may have been the source of Sutherland&#x27;s (1947) differential association theory. The researchers have provided a clear analysis that the city is a place where life is superficial, where people are anonymous, where relationships are transitory and friendship and family bonds are weak. They have observed the weakening of primary social relationships and relate this to a process of social disorganization (comparison with the concept of &quot;anomie&quot; and the strain theories is instructive).

==Ecology and social theories==
Vasishth and Sloane (2000) argue that while it is tempting to draw analogies between organisms in nature and the human condition, the problem lies in reductionism, i.e. that the science of biology is oversimplified into rules that are then applied mechanically to explain the growth and dynamics of human communities. The most fundamental difficulties are definitional:

* If a community is a group of individuals who inhabit the same place, is the community merely the sum of individuals and their activities, or is it something more than an aggregation of individuals? This is critical in planning research into group interactions. 
* Will research be effective if it focuses on the individuals composing a group, or is the community itself a proper subject of research independently of the individuals who compose it? If the former, then data on individuals will explain the community, but if the community either directly or indirectly affects the behavior of its members, then research must consider the patterns and processes of community as distinct from patterns and processes in populations of individuals. But this requires a definition and distinction between &quot;pattern&quot; and &quot;process&quot;.

The structures, forms, and patterns are relatively easy to observe and measure, but they are nothing more than evidence of underlying processes and functions which are the real constitutive forces in nature and society. The Chicago school wanted to develop tools by which to research and then change society by directing urban planning and social intervention agencies. It recognized that urban expansion was not haphazard but quite strongly controlled by community-level forces such as land values, zoning ordinances, landscape features, circulation corridors, and historical contingency. This was characterized as ecological because the external factors were neither chance nor intended, but rather arose from the natural forces in the environment which limit the adaptive spatial and temporal relationships between individuals. The school sought to derive patterns from a study of processes, rather than to ascribe processes to observed patterns and the patterns they saw emerge, are strongly reminiscent of Clements&#x27; ideas of community development.

==Conclusions==
The Chicago Area Project was a practical attempt by sociologists to apply their theories in a city laboratory. Subsequent research showed that the youth athletic leagues, recreation programs, and summer camp worked best along with urban planning and alternatives to incarceration as crime control policy. Such programs are non-entrepreneurial and non-self-sustaining, and they fail when local or central government does not make a sustained financial commitment to them. Although with hindsight, the school&#x27;s attempts to map crime may have produced some distortions, the work was valuable in that it moved away from a study of pattern and place toward a study of function and scale. To that extent, this was work of high quality that represented the best science available to the researchers at the time.

The Social Disorganization Theory itself was a landmark concept and, as it focuses on the absence or breakdown of social control mechanisms, there are obvious links with social control theory. Travis Hirschi (1969) argues that variations in delinquent behavior among youth could be explained by variations in the dimensions of the social bond, namely attachment to others, commitments to conventional goals, acceptance of conventional moral standards or beliefs, and involvement in conventional activities. The greater the social bonds between a youth and society, the lower the odds of involvement in delinquency. When social bonds to conventional role models, values and institutions are aggregated for youth in a particular setting, they measure much the same phenomena as captured by concepts such as network ties or social integration. But the fact that these theories focus on the absence of control or the barriers to progress, means that they are ignoring the societal pressures and cultural values that drive the system Merton identified in the Strain Theory or the motivational forces Cohen proposed were generating crime and delinquency. More modern theorists like Empey (1967) argue that the system of values, norms and beliefs can be disorganized in the sense that there are conflicts among values, norms and beliefs within a widely shared, dominant culture. While condemning crime in general, law-abiding citizens may nevertheless respect and admire the criminal who takes risks and successfully engages in exciting, dangerous activities. The depiction of a society as a collection of socially differentiated groups with distinct subcultural perspectives that lead some of these groups into conflict with the law is another form of cultural disorganization, is typically called cultural conflict.

Modern versions of the theory sometimes use different terminology to refer to the same ecological causal processes. For example, Crutchfield, Geerken and Gove (1982) hypothesize that the social integration of communities is inhibited by population turnover and report supporting evidence in the explanation of variation in crime rates among cities. The greater the mobility of the population in a city, the higher the crime rates. These arguments are identical to those proposed by social disorganization theorists and the evidence in support of it is as indirect as the evidence cited by social disorganization theorists. But, by referring to social integration rather than disintegration, this research has not generated the same degree of criticism as social disorganization theory.

<text>The Chicago school of economics is a neoclassical school of economic thought associated with the work of the faculty at the University of Chicago, some of whom have constructed and popularized its principles. Milton Friedman and George Stigler are considered the leading scholars of the Chicago school.

Chicago macroeconomic theory rejected Keynesianism in favor of monetarism until the mid-1970s, when it turned to new classical macroeconomics heavily based on the concept of rational expectations. The freshwater‚Äìsaltwater distinction is largely antiquated today, as the two traditions have heavily incorporated ideas from each other. Specifically, new Keynesian economics was developed as a response to new classical economics, electing to incorporate the insight of rational expectations without giving up the traditional Keynesian focus on imperfect competition and sticky wages.

Chicago economists have also left their intellectual influence in other fields, notably in pioneering public choice theory and law and economics, which have led to revolutionary changes in the study of political science and law. Other economists affiliated with Chicago have made their impact in fields as diverse as social economics and economic history. 

As of 2022, the University of Chicago Economics department, considered one of the world&#x27;s foremost economics departments, has been awarded 14 Nobel Memorial Prizes in Economic Sciences‚Äîmore than any other university‚Äîand has been awarded six John Bates Clark Medals. Not all members of the department belong to the Chicago school of economics, which is a school of thought rather than an organization.

==History and terminology==
The term was coined in the 1950s to refer to economists teaching in the Economics Department at the University of Chicago, and closely related academic areas at the university such as the Booth School of Business, Harris School of Public Policy and the Law School. In the context of macroeconomics, it is connected to the freshwater school of macroeconomics, in contrast to the saltwater school based in coastal universities (notably Harvard, Yale, Penn, UC Berkeley, and UCLA).

The Chicago economists met together in frequent intense discussions that helped set a group outlook on economic issues, based on price theory. The 1950s saw the height of popularity of the Keynesian school of economics, so the members of the University of Chicago were considered heterodox. Besides what is popularly known as the &quot;Chicago school&quot;, there is also an &quot;Old Chicago&quot; or the &quot;first-generation&quot; Chicago school of economics, consisting of an earlier generation of economists (approximately the 1920&#x27;s to 1940&#x27;s) such as Frank Knight, Henry Simons, Lloyd Mints, Jacob Viner, Aaron Director and others. This group had diverse interests and approaches, but Knight, Simons, and Director in particular advocated a focus on the role of incentives and the complexity of economic events rather than on general equilibrium. Outside of Chicago, these early leaders were important influences on the Virginia school of political economy. Nonetheless, these scholars had an important influence on the thought of Milton Friedman and George Stigler who were the leaders of the &quot;second-generation&quot; Chicago school, most notably in the development of price theory and transaction cost economics. The &quot;third generation&quot; of Chicago economics is led by Gary Becker, as well as macroeconomists Robert Lucas Jr. and Eugene Fama.

A further significant branching of Chicago thought was dubbed by George Stigler as &quot;Chicago political economy&quot;. Inspired by the Coasian view that institutions evolve to maximize the Pareto efficiency, Chicago political economy came to the surprising and controversial view that politics tends towards efficiency and that policy advice is irrelevant.

== Awards and honors ==

=== Nobel Memorial Prizes ===

As of 2022, the University of Chicago Economics Department has been awarded 15 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (laureates were affiliated with the department when receiving the prizes) since the prize was first awarded in 1969. In addition, as of October 2018, 32 out of the total 81 Nobel laureates in Economics have been affiliated with the university as alumni, faculty members or researchers, which has been a source of controversy. However, not all members of the department belong to the Chicago school of economics.
=== John Bates Clark Medals ===
As of 2019, the University of Chicago Economics Department has been awarded six John Bates Clark Medals (medalists were affiliated with the department when receiving the medals) since the medal was first awarded in 1947. However, some medalists may &quot;not&quot; belong to the Chicago school of economics.
==Notable scholars==

=== Early members ===

====Frank Knight====
Frank Knight (1885‚Äì1972) was an early member of the University of Chicago department. He joined the department in 1929, coming from the University of Iowa. His most influential work was &quot;Risk, Uncertainty and Profit&quot; (1921) from which the term Knightian uncertainty was derived. Knight&#x27;s perspective was iconoclastic, and markedly different from later Chicago school thinkers. He believed that while the free market could be inefficient, government programs were even less efficient. He drew from other economic schools of thought such as institutional economics to form his own nuanced perspective.

==== Henry Simons ====

Henry Calvert Simons (1899‚Äì1946) did his graduate work at the University of Chicago but did not submit his final dissertation to receive a degree. In fact, he was initially influenced by Frank Knight while he was an assistant professor at the University of Iowa from 1925 to 1927, and in summer 1927 Simons decided to join the Department of Economics at the University of Chicago (earlier than Knight did). He was a long-term member in the Chicago economics department, most notable for his antitrust and monetarist models.

==== Jacob Viner ====
Jacob Viner (1892‚Äì1970) was in the faculty of Chicago&#x27;s economics department for 30 years (1916‚Äì1946). He inspired a generation of economists at Chicago, including Milton Friedman.

==== Aaron Director ====
Aaron Director (1901‚Äì2004) had been a professor at Chicago&#x27;s Law School since 1946. He is regarded as a founder of the field Law and economics and established &quot;The Journal of Law &amp; Economics&quot; in 1958&quot;.&quot; Director influenced some of the next generation of jurists, including Richard Posner, Antonin Scalia and Chief Justice William Rehnquist.

====Theodore Schultz====
A group of agricultural economists led by Theodore Schultz (1902‚Äì1998) and D. Gale Johnson (1916‚Äì2003) moved from Iowa State to the University of Chicago in the mid-1940s. Schultz served as the chair of economics from 1946 to 1961. He became president of the American Economic Association in 1960, retired in 1967, though he remained active at the University of Chicago until his death in 1998. Johnson served as department chair from 1971 to 1975 and 1980‚Äì1984 and was president of the American Economics Association in 1999. Their research in farm and agricultural economics was widely influential and attracted funding from the Rockefeller Foundation to the agricultural economics program at the university. Among the graduate students and faculty affiliated with the pair in the 1940s and 1950s were Clifford Hardin, Zvi Griliches, Marc Nerlove, and George S. Tolley. In 1979, Schultz was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work in human capital theory and economic development.

=== Second generation ===

====Milton Friedman====

Milton Friedman (1912‚Äì2006) stands as one of the most influential economists of the late twentieth century. A student of Frank Knight, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1976 for, among other things, &quot;A Monetary History of the United States&quot; (1963). Friedman argued that the Great Depression had been caused by the Federal Reserve&#x27;s policies through the 1920s and worsened in the 1930s. Friedman argued that laissez-faire government policy is more desirable than government intervention in the economy:

Governments should aim for a neutral monetary policy oriented toward long-run economic growth, by gradual expansion of the money supply. He advocated the quantity theory of money, that general prices are determined by money. Therefore, active monetary (e.g. easy credit) or fiscal (e.g. tax and spend) policy can have unintended negative effects. In &quot;Capitalism and Freedom&quot; (1992) Friedman wrote:
The slogan that &quot;money matters&quot; has come to be associated with Friedman, but Friedman had also leveled harsh criticism of his ideological opponents. Referring to Thorstein Veblen&#x27;s assertion that economics unrealistically models people as &quot;lightning calculator[s] of pleasure and pain&quot;, Friedman wrote:
====George Stigler====
George Stigler (1911‚Äì1991) was tutored for his thesis by Frank Knight and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1982. He is best known for developing the &quot;Economic Theory of Regulation&quot;, also known as regulatory capture, which says that interest groups and other political participants will use the regulatory and coercive powers of government to shape laws and regulations in a way that is beneficial to them. This theory is an important component of the Public Choice field of economics. He also carried out extensive research into the history of economic thought. His 1962 article &quot;Information in the Labor Market&quot; developed the theory of search unemployment.

====Ronald Coase====
Ronald Coase (1910‚Äì2013) was the most prominent economic analyst of law and the 1991 Nobel Prize-winner. His first major article, &quot;The Nature of the Firm&quot; (1937), argued that the reason for the existence of firms (companies, partnerships, etc.) is the existence of transaction costs. Rational individuals trade through bilateral contracts on open markets until the costs of transactions mean that using corporations to produce things is more cost-effective.

His second major article, &quot;The Problem of Social Cost&quot; (1960), argued that if we lived in a world without transaction costs, people would bargain with one another to create the same allocation of resources, regardless of the way a court might rule in property disputes. Coase used the example of an 1879 London legal case about nuisance named &quot;Sturges v Bridgman&quot;, in which a noisy sweetmaker and a quiet doctor were neighbours; the doctor went to court seeking an injunction against the noise produced by the sweetmaker. Coase said that regardless of whether the judge ruled that the sweetmaker had to stop using his machinery, or that the doctor had to put up with it, they could strike a mutually beneficial bargain that reaches the same outcome of resource distribution. Only the existence of transaction costs may prevent this.

So, the law ought to pre-empt what &quot;would&quot; happen, and be guided by the most efficient solution. The idea is that law and regulation are not as important or effective at helping people as lawyers and government planners believe. Coase and others like him wanted a change of approach, to put the burden of proof for positive effects on a government that was intervening in the market, by analysing the costs of action.

=== Third generation ===

====Gary Becker====
Gary Becker (1930‚Äì2014) received the Nobel Prize in Economics 1992 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2007. Becker received his PhD at the University of Chicago in 1955 under H. Gregg Lewis, and was influenced by Milton Friedman. In 1970, he returned to Chicago as a professor and stayed affiliated with the university until his death. He is considered one of the founding fathers of Chicago political economy, and one of the most influential economists and social scientists in the second half of the twentieth century.

Becker was known in his work for applying economic methods of thinking to other fields, such as crime, sexual relationships, slavery and drugs, assuming that people act rationally. His work was originally focused in labor economics. His work partly inspired the popular economics book &quot;Freakonomics&quot;. In June 2011, the Becker Friedman Institute for Research in Economics was established at the University of Chicago in honor of Gary Becker and Milton Friedman.

====Robert E. Lucas====
Robert Lucas (born 1937), who won the Nobel Prize in 1995, has dedicated his life to unwinding Keynesianism. His major contribution is the argument that macroeconomics should not be seen as a separate mode of thought from microeconomics, and that analysis in both should be built on the same foundations. Lucas&#x27;s works cover several topics in macroeconomics, included economic growth, asset pricing, and monetary economics.

====Eugene Fama====


Eugene Fama (born 1939) is an American financial economist who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2013 for his work on empirical asset pricing and is the fourth most highly cited economist of all time. He has spent all of his teaching career at the University of Chicago and is the originator of the efficient-market hypothesis, first defined in his 1965 article as a market where &quot;at any point in time, the actual price of a security will be a good estimate of its intrinsic value&quot;. The notion was further explored in his 1970 article, &quot;Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical Work&quot;, which brought the notion of efficient markets into the forefront of modern economic theory, and his 1991 article, &quot;Efficient Markets II&quot;. Whilst his 1965 PhD thesis, &quot;The Behavior of Stock Market Prices&quot;, showed that stock prices can be approximated by a random walk in the short-term; in later work he showed that insofar as stock prices are predictable in the long-term, it is largely due to rational time-varying risk premia which can be modelled using the Fama‚ÄìFrench three-factor model (1993, 1996) or their updated five-factor model (2014). His work showing that the value premium can persist despite rational forecasts of future earnings and that the performance of actively managed funds is almost entirely due to chance or exposure to risk are all supportive of an efficient-markets view of the world.

====Robert Fogel====
Robert Fogel (1926‚Äì2013), a co-winner of the Nobel Prize in 1993, is well known for his historical analysis and his introduction of New economic history, and invention of cliometrics. In his tract, &quot;Railroads and American Economic Growth: Essays in Econometric History,&quot; Fogel set out to rebut comprehensively the idea that railroads contributed to economic growth in the 19th century. Later, in &quot;Time on the Cross: The Economics of American Negro Slavery&quot;, he argued that slaves in the Southern states of America had a higher standard of living than the industrial proletariat of the Northern states before the American Civil War.

====James Heckman====
James Heckman (born 1944) is a Nobel Prize-winner from 2000, is known for his pioneering work in econometrics and microeconomics.

====Lars Peter Hansen====
Lars Peter Hansen (born 1952) is an American economist who won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2013 with Eugene Fama and Robert Shiller for their work on asset pricing. Hansen began teaching at the University of Chicago in 1981 and is the David Rockefeller Distinguished Service Professor of economics at the University of Chicago. Although best known for his work on the Generalized method of moments, he is also a distinguished macroeconomist, focusing on the linkages between the financial and real sectors of the economy.

====Richard Posner====

Richard Posner (born 1939) is known primarily for his work in law and economics, though Robert Solow describes Posner&#x27;s grasp of certain economic ideas as &quot;in some respects... precarious&quot;. A federal appellate judge rather than an economist, Posner&#x27;s main work, &quot;Economic Analysis of Law&quot; attempts to apply rational choice models to areas of law. He has chapters on tort, contract, corporations, labor law, but also criminal law, discrimination and family law. Posner goes so far as to say that:

====Friedrich Hayek====

Friedrich Hayek (1899‚Äì1992) made frequent contacts with many at the University of Chicago during the 1940s, while he was still at the London School of Economics (he moved to the University of Chicago in 1950). His book &quot;The Road to Serfdom,&quot; published in the U.S. by the University of Chicago Press in September 1944 with the help of Aaron Director, played a seminal role in transforming how Milton Friedman and others understood how society works. The University Press continued to publish a large number of Hayek&#x27;s works in later years, such as &quot;The Fatal Conceit&quot; and &quot;The Constitution of Liberty&quot;. In 1947, Hayek, Frank Knight, Friedman and George Stigler worked together in forming the Mont P√®lerin Society, an international forum for libertarian economists.

During 1950‚Äì1962, Hayek was a faculty member of the Committee of Social Thought at the University of Chicago, where he conducted a number of influential faculty seminars. There were a number of Chicago academics who worked on research projects sympathetic to some of Hayek&#x27;s own, such as Aaron Director, who was active in the Chicago School in helping to fund and establish what became the &quot;Law and Society&quot; program in the University of Chicago Law School. Hayek and Friedman also cooperated in support of the Intercollegiate Society of Individualists, later renamed the Intercollegiate Studies Institute, an American student organisation devoted to libertarian ideas.

==== James M. Buchanan ====
James M. Buchanan (1919‚Äì2013) won the 1986 Nobel Prize in Economics for his public choice theory. He studied under Frank H. Knight at the University of Chicago, receiving PhD in 1948. Although he did not hold any position at the university afterwards, his later work is closely related to the thought of the Chicago school. Buchanan was the foremost proponent of the Virginia school of political economy.

====Thomas Sowell====
Thomas Sowell (born in 1930) received his PhD at the University of Chicago in 1968, under George Stigler. A libertarian conservative in his perspective, he is considered to be a representative of the Chicago school.

==Criticisms==

Paul Douglas, economist and Democratic senator from Illinois for 18 years, was uncomfortable with the environment he found at the university. He stated that, &quot;...I was disconcerted to find that the economic and political conservatives had acquired almost complete dominance over my department and taught that market decisions were always right and profit values the supreme ones... The opinions of my colleagues would have confined government to the eighteenth-century functions of justice, police, and arms, which I thought had been insufficient even for that time and were certainly so for ours. These men would neither use statistical data to develop economic theory nor accept critical analysis of the economic system... (Frank) Knight was now openly hostile, and his disciples seemed to be everywhere. If I stayed, it would be in an unfriendly environment.&quot;

While the efficacy of Eugene Fama&#x27;s efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) was debated after the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08, proponents emphasized that the EMH is consistent with the large decline in asset prices since the event was unpredictable. Specifically, if market crashes never occurred, &quot;this&quot; would contradict the EMH since the average return of risky assets would be too large to justify the decreased risk of a large decline in prices; and if anything, the equity premium puzzle implies that market crashes do not happen &quot;enough&quot; to justify the high Sharpe ratio of US stocks and other risky assets.

Economist Brad DeLong of the University of California, Berkeley says the Chicago School has experienced an &quot;intellectual collapse&quot;, while Nobel laureate Paul Krugman of Princeton University says that some recent comments from Chicago school economists are &quot;the product of a Dark Age of macroeconomics in which hard-won knowledge has been forgotten&quot;, claiming that most peer-reviewed macroeconomic research since the mid-1960s has been wrong, preferring models developed in the 1930s. Chicago finance economist John Cochrane countered that these criticisms were &quot;ad hominem&quot;, displayed a &quot;deep and highly politicized ignorance of what economics and finance is really all about&quot;, and failed to disentangle bubbles from rational risk premiums and crying wolf too many times in a row, emphasizing that even if these criticisms were true, it would make a stronger argument &quot;against&quot; regulation and control.

<doc id="417459" wikidata="Q772086" url="?curid=417459" title="Todd Akin">
<text>William Todd Akin (July 5, 1947 ‚Äì¬†October 3, 2021) was an American politician who served as the U.S. representative for from 2001 to 2013. He was a member of the Republican Party. Born in New York City, Akin grew up in the Greater St. Louis area. After receiving his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts, Akin served in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and worked in the computer and steel industries. In 1988, he was elected to the Missouri House of Representatives. He served in the state house until 2000, when he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, in which he served until 2013.

Akin&#x27;s Congressional career ended after he lost a bid to unseat Democratic U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill in the 2012 election. Akin, who had won the Republican primary in a crowded field, led McCaskill in pre-election polls until he said that women who are victims of what he called &quot;legitimate rape&quot; rarely get pregnant. Akin eventually apologized for the remark but rebuffed calls to withdraw from the election. He lost to McCaskill, 54.7 percent to 39.2 percent. In a book published in July 2014, Akin defended his original comments and said he regretted having apologized.

==Early life, education, and business career==
Akin was born in New York City, and raised in the St. Louis area. He was the son of Nancy Perry (n√©e Bigelow) and Paul Bigelow Akin. Akin&#x27;s great-grandfather, Thomas Russell Akin, founded Laclede Steel Corporation of St. Louis in 1911. The company eventually passed to his grandfather, William Akin, and then to his father Paul, a third-generation graduate of Harvard University who served as an officer in the Navy during World War II.

Akin graduated from John Burroughs School, a private prep school in suburban St. Louis, and Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts, earning a Bachelor of Science in Management Engineering in 1970. Following graduation, Akin served as an engineer officer in the National Guard of the U.S. Army, then served in the Army Reserve until 1980. After leaving active duty, Akin sold large computer systems for IBM, then worked as a manager in his family&#x27;s steel business. Akin earned a Master of Divinity (M.Div.) degree in 1984 from Covenant Theological Seminary where he studied Greek, Hebrew, and a socially conservative interpretation of the Christian scriptures. He did not enter the ministry.

Akin was a longtime anti-abortion activist and a onetime member of the board of Missouri Right to Life. He was arrested for trespass at least eight times between 1985 and 1988 while demonstrating against abortion in front of abortion clinics in Illinois and Missouri. He said the protests were peaceful and he would not apologize for standing up for his beliefs. At the time of the arrests, he was using the name &quot;William Akin&quot;; after that period, when he ran for political office, it was as &quot;Todd Akin&quot;.

==Missouri House of Representatives==
===Elections===
Akin was elected to the Missouri House of Representatives in November 1988, running unopposed to represent District 85 in West County. He won re-election in 1990 with 59% of the vote. Due to re-districting, Akin represented District 86 from 1993 through 2000, never winning less than 66% of the vote.

===Tenure===
Akin served as a member of the House Ways and Means Committee. During his 12 years in the state house, Akin advocated for homeschool rights, voted for carrying concealed weapons, voted against the parks and soils sales tax, and voted against the 1993 tax increase and education spending increase. Akin sponsored legislation to prohibit casino companies from contributing to Missouri state lawmakers. In 1995, he fought Democratic governor Mel Carnahan over a bill providing state funding for school nurses. Ultimately, the governor refused to sign the funding bill due to Akin&#x27;s amendment, which would have prohibited nurses from telling students about sources for information about abortion.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
In 2000, Akin ran in the Republican primary election to fill the House seat vacated by U.S. Representative Jim Talent, who was running for governor. Light voter turnout caused by heavy rains helped Akin win the tight, five-way primary by just 56 votes; he defeated two better-known candidates, former St. Louis County Executive Gene McNary and State Senator Franc Flotron. On the night he won the primary, Akin said, &quot;My base will show up in earthquakes.&quot; He defeated Democratic state senator Ted House in the general election, winning 55 percent of the vote. He never faced another contest as close, and was reelected five times. In 2010, Akin won re-election with 67.9% of the vote.

===Tenure===
Akin earned a 96% rating from the American Conservative Union in 2008, and 100% in 2007.

For most of his tenure, Akin was listed in the official House roll as &quot;R-St. Louis,&quot; even though his district didn&#x27;t include any portion of the city of St. Louis.

====Social issues====
Akin was an outspoken opponent of abortion in all cases, including health reasons or in cases of rape or incest, and he opposed embryonic stem cell research. In a 2008 speech on the House floor, Akin called abortion providers &quot;terrorists&quot; and alleged that it was &quot;common practice&quot; for abortion providers to perform &quot;abortions&quot; on women who were not actually pregnant.

Akin was a supporter of the right to keep and bear arms and had an &quot;A&quot; rating from the NRA Political Victory Fund. Akin was a staunch advocate of a federal prohibition of online poker. In 2006, he co-sponsored H.R. 4411, the Goodlatte-Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act, and H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act.

Akin also authored the Protect the Pledge (of Allegiance) Act. In late June 2011, Akin objected to NBC&#x27;s recent removal of the words &quot;under God&quot; from a video clip of school children reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. After remarking that &quot;NBC has a long record of being very liberal,&quot; Akin said, &quot;at the heart of liberalism really was a hatred for God and a belief that government should replace God&quot;. Two days later, Akin said he did not mean all liberals hate God, only that liberals have &quot;a hatred for public references for God.&quot; The next day, he apologized, saying his statement had been &quot;directed at the political movement, Liberalism, not at any specific individual&quot;.

During his 2012 U.S. Senate bid, Akin reaffirmed his opposition to legislation like the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, which he voted against as a Congressman.

Akin opposed the No Child Left Behind Act. Akin believed that it should not be the federal government that decides on education, but that local government should have control over public education.

====Fiscal issues====
In his early years in Congress, Akin brought back earmarks for his district, voted to raise the debt ceiling, voted for off-balance-sheet wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and voted to create the unfunded Medicare prescription drug benefit. Later in his tenure he opposed increases in taxation and spending. He voted in 2007 against an expansion of the State Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), objecting to its potential coverage of children in families making up to $62,000 a year, and stating that proof of U.S. citizenship was not required. He also said the bill would &quot;weaken the private health care system&quot; and lead the country &quot;further down the slippery slope to socialized medicine.&quot; He voted against federally funded school breakfasts and lunches, and called student loans &quot;a stage-three cancer of socialism&quot;. He also voted against increasing the minimum wage. He was a vocal critic of the September 2008 bank bailout, and voted against it. He voted no on the Affordable Health Care Act in March 2010, and on Paul Ryan&#x27;s fiscal year 2012 budget.

====Military issues====
Akin spent time working on military and veterans issues. On the House Armed Services Committee he served as the chairman of the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, which handles Navy and Air Force issues. He served as the Ranking Republican on the Seapower Subcommittee and the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee. Akin also introduced veterans-related bills, most notably the Open Burn Pit Registry Act, which creates a registry for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who were exposed to burn pits. He opposed repeal of the Dover Policy, which banned media coverage of caskets of troops returning home from overseas, citing privacy and decorum issues.

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Armed Services
** Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces
** Subcommittee on Seapower and Expeditionary Forces (chairman)
* Committee on the Budget
* Committee on Science, Space and Technology
** Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics
** Subcommittee on Energy and Environment

===Caucus memberships===
* Republican Study Committee
* Tea Party Caucus

==2012 U.S. Senate election==
In mid-May 2011, Akin announced he would seek the Republican nomination in 2012 to unseat Democratic senator Claire McCaskill. Other candidates in the August 2012 Republican primary included businessman John Brunner, author and business executive Mark Memoly, and former Missouri Treasurer Sarah Steelman who had backing from the Tea Party.
Despite losing some momentum and in a crowded field, Akin won the Republican nomination in the August 7 open primary, 36% to 30% for his nearest challenger. The Claire McCaskill campaign spent $2¬†million during the primaries, despite not having a primary opponent. That money was spent on advertising touting Akin as &quot;Too conservative,&quot; for Missouri. In 2012, &quot;National Journal&quot; named Akin one of ten Republicans to follow on Twitter).

Akin faced McCaskill and Libertarian nominee Jonathan Dine in the general election, losing to McCaskill after his controversial comments on rape lost him a great deal of support.

===Home of record===
In May 2011, questions were raised about Akin&#x27;s official address for voting. For most of his political career, Akin had claimed Town and Country as his official residence. However, according to the Associated Press and the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot;, Akin moved to Wildwood, in far western St. Louis County, sometime between 2007 and 2009, after he and his wife purchased a second home there. However, he continued to vote as a Town and Country resident, and signed a polling place logbook attesting to his living there in April 2011.

===Comments on rape and pregnancy===

In a local news interview, on August 19, 2012, whilst discussing abortion, Akin claimed that victims of what he described as &quot;legitimate rape&quot; very rarely become pregnant. Airing on St. Louis television station KTVI, his response to a question on rape exceptions for abortion was:

Well you know, people always want to try to make that as one of those things, well how do you, how do you slice this particularly tough sort of ethical question. First of all, from what I understand from doctors, that&#x27;s really rare. If it&#x27;s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. But let&#x27;s assume that maybe that didn&#x27;t work or something. I think there should be some punishment, but the punishment ought to be on the rapist and not attacking the child.

The comments from Akin, which came as he ran for the U.S. Senate seat held by Claire McCaskill, almost immediately led to widespread uproar. The term &quot;legitimate rape&quot; was called &quot;loathsome&quot; because it suggests that &quot;there are different categories of rape ‚Äì some real and awful and others that are not&quot;. Others took exception to the phrasing because it suggests that the victims who do become pregnant from rape may be lying. His claims about the likelihood of pregnancy resulting from rape were seen by some as being based on fringe ideas like stress-induced miscarriage or Dr. John C. Willke&#x27;s &quot;spastic tubes&quot; theory introduced in 1985 and trauma-based theory introduced in 1999. These theories are not accepted by the majority of the scientific and medical community. Akin was not the first to make such claims, but was perhaps one of the most prominent until then.

The comment was widely characterized as misogynistic and recklessly inaccurate, with many commentators remarking on the use of the words &quot;legitimate rape&quot;. Related news articles cited a 1996 article in an obstetrics and gynecology journal, which found that 5% of women who were raped became pregnant, which equaled about 32,000 pregnancies each year in the US alone. A separate 2003 article in the journal &quot;Human Nature&quot; estimated that rapes are twice as likely to result in pregnancies as consensual sex.

While some colleagues such as Iowa congressman Steve King and Tennessee state senator Stacey Campfield supported Akin, senior figures in both parties condemned his remarks and some Republicans called for him to resign. In the resulting furor, Akin received widespread calls to drop out of his Senate race from both Republicans and Democrats.

Akin characterized his comments as a gaffe, saying he &quot;misspoke.&quot; His campaign ran an advertisement in which he asked voters to forgive him, saying:

Rape was an evil act. I used the wrong words in the wrong way and for that I apologize. As the father of two daughters, I want tough justice for predators. I have a compassionate heart for the victims of sexual assault. I pray for them. The fact is, rape can lead to pregnancy. The truth is, rape has many victims. The mistake I made was in the words I said, not in the heart I hold. I ask for your forgiveness.

The incident was seen as having an impact on Akin&#x27;s senate race and the Republicans&#x27; chances of gaining a majority in the U.S. Senate, by making news in the week before the 2012 Republican National Convention and by &quot;shift[ing] the national discussion to divisive social issues that could repel swing voters rather than economic issues that could attract them&quot;.

===Election result===
Before the comments, Akin had been favored to win his race against McCaskill, but he lost in November, 54.7 percent to 39.2 percent. His loss was attributed to backlash from women voters. After the election, between November 2012 and August 2013, Akin received $111,000 in donations that in part were for the 2018 Senate primaries, however he left after his term finished on January 3, 2013.

===Aftermath===
In July 2014, WND Books published Akin&#x27;s book, &quot;Firing Back: Taking on the Party Bosses and Media Elite to Protect Our Faith and Freedom.&quot; In it, he said that he regretted apologizing, because &quot;by asking the public at large for forgiveness, I was validating the willful misinterpretation of what I had said.&quot; He also defended his original comments and attacked various Republicans for &quot;wronging&quot; him, including Karl Rove; former National Republican Senatorial Committee Executive Director Rob Jesmer; Senators Mitch McConnell, John Cornyn, John McCain, Roy Blunt, and Lindsey Graham; and House Speaker John Boehner. He also repeatedly attacked the Republican establishment for seeing his comments &quot;as their opportunity to take [me] out and select someone more palatable to their tastes&quot;, and the &quot;liberal media&quot; for making him &quot;the target of a media assassination.&quot;

==Personal life==
Akin married Lulli Boe, a graduate of Hollins University, in June 1975. The couple had six children. Lulli became a home schooling activist, and all of the children were home-schooled. Three sons attended the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis and became officers in the U. S. Marines. One of his sons served in the assault on Fallujah, Iraq. Akin and his wife lived for many years in his childhood home, a house owned by his father in affluent Town and Country, Missouri. When his father sought to subdivide the 8.5-acre property in the late 2000s, Akin moved to a house in Wildwood.

===Health and death===
In April 2001, Akin had surgery to treat prostate cancer, which was detected at an &quot;early stage&quot;. He died from cancer at his home on October 3, 2021, at age 74.

<text>Niranjan Joseph De Silva Deva Aditya (born 11 May 1948), known as Nirj Deva, is a British politician. A member of the Conservative Party, he served as a Member of the European Parliament for South East England from 1999 to 2019. He was a Member of Parliament (MP) in the British House of Commons from 1992 to 1997, for the seat of Brentford and Isleworth.

Deva was born in Sri Lanka into a politically active family and was raised in Britain. He was the fifth Asian-born person to be elected a Member of the House of Commons, and in 1999 became the second so-born to be elected as a Conservative to the European Parliament which operates via a party list system. In November 2011 Deva became the European Conservatives and Reformists Group&#x27;s candidate for President of the European Parliament, following three UN-related roles, representing the European Union, in the 2005 to 2006 period.

==Family background and education==
Deva was born in Colombo, Sri Lanka, to a leading family of Rajasthani (Indian) descent, and is a Roman Catholic. His grandfather was a Senator in the first Sri Lankan (Ceylon) Parliament. Deva&#x27;s father was Dr. Kingsley De Silva Deva Aditya, a prominent eye surgeon in Colombo, Sri Lanka. His mother Zita was the daughter of Dr. M. G. Perera, a member of the Senate in then Ceylon. He spent his primary and secondary education at St. Joseph&#x27;s College, a Catholic school in Colombo. He holds Sri Lankan and British citizenship, and speaks Sinhala and English.

Deva was educated at Loughborough University, where he completed a degree in Aeronautical Engineering and was subsequently a Postgraduate Research Fellow in Economics.

==British Parliament==
Deva stood as the Conservative Party candidate in Hammersmith at the 1987 general election but lost by 2,415 votes to sitting Labour MP Clive Soley.

At the 1992 general election, Deva was elected to the House of Commons as MP for the London constituency of Brentford and Isleworth with a majority of 2,086. During his time in Parliament, Deva served as a Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) at the Scottish Office. Deva was only the fifth Asian-born person to be elected a Member of the House of Commons and serve in the British Government.

He was defeated in the 1997 general election, losing to the Labour candidate Ann Keen by 14,424 votes.

==European Parliament==
Deva was chosen by the Conservatives to be one of their candidates for the South East England at the 1999 European Parliament election. This was to be the first European election in the UK to use the closed party-list proportional representation electoral system and Deva was placed fifth amongst the eleven Conservatives candidates in South East England. Following the election the Conservatives were entitled to five MEPs from South East England and therefore Deva was elected to the European Parliament. Deva became the first Asian-born person to be elected as a Conservative member of the European Parliament. At the 2004 European Parliament election Deva was moved up to second place on the Conservatives&#x27; list of candidates for South East England. After the election the Conservatives were entitled to four MEPs from South East England and therefore Deva was re-elected to the European Parliament.

In April 2005 he was chairman of the European Parliament&#x27;s delegation to the UN Commission on Sustainable Development in New York, and delivered a paper on the future of the United Nations at the US Council on Foreign Relations. A few months later, he headed the European Parliament&#x27;s delegation to the UN High-Level Conference on global financing of aid. Also in 2005 he was Co-Chairman (with former Prime Minister of France Michel Rocard) of the European Parliaments&#x27; Delegation to the World Summit at the United Nations 60th General Assembly.

At the 2009 European Parliament election Deva was placed third on the Conservatives&#x27; list of candidates for South East England. After the election the Conservatives were entitled to four MEPs from South East England and therefore Deva was re-elected to the European Parliament.

In November 2011 it was announced that Deva would be the European Conservatives and Reformists Group&#x27;s candidate for President of the European Parliament. In the election in January 2012 he was backed by 142 MEPs, compared to the S&amp;D winning candidate Martin Schulz, backed by 387 MEPs.

At the 2014 European Parliament election Deva was ranked one spot higher for the same EU region. After the election the Conservatives were entitled to three MEPs from South East England and therefore Deva was re-elected to the European Parliament. After the election mainstream Sri Lankan media falsely reported Deva had increased &quot;his share&quot; of the vote: electors vote for the party, not the candidate, and Conservative votes and share of the vote decreased.

Deva serves as co-ordinator on the Committee on Overseas Development and Cooperation, and is a bureau member of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly. He is also a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the European Parliament.

<text>Sybil Judith Chaplin , known as Judith Chaplin (n√©e Schofield; 19 August 193919 February 1993), was a British Conservative Party politician.

==Career==
Chaplin was elected a councillor on Norfolk County Council in 1975, following her husband into the role; on the council she became chairman of the education committee. She took on a role in 1986 with the Institute of Directors, becoming head of policy for the group. In 1988 she became special advisor to Nigel Lawson, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, and remained in the role when John Major took over the following year. When Major became Prime Minister, she acted as his Private Secretary and political assistant.

She was elected to Parliament for Newbury at the 1992 election. That June she was appointed OBE, and she was considered likely to become chancellor of the exchequer herself in the future; however, these hopes were ended less than a year later by her sudden death.

==Personal life==
Sybil Judith Schofield was born in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, on 19 August 1939. Her father, Theodore Thomas Schofield, was a dentist; her mother was Sybil Elsie, n√©e Saunders. She was educated at Wycombe Abbey before studying economics at Girton College, Cambridge. She went on to gain a postgraduate degree in economics from the University of East Anglia.

She married Robert Walpole, 10th Baron Walpole, in 1962. They had two sons and two daughters, including Alice Walpole, Ambassador of the United Kingdom to Luxembourg. However, their marriage was ultimately dissolved in 1979, and she married Michael Chaplin in 1984.

Judith Chaplin died of a pulmonary embolism on 19 February 1993.

<text>Frank Alo LoBiondo (: born May 12, 1946) is an American businessman and politician who served as the U.S. representative for from 1995 to 2019. He is a member of the Republican Party. He represented all of Atlantic, Cape May, Cumberland and Salem Counties and parts of Camden, Gloucester, Burlington, and Ocean Counties.
In November 2017, LoBiondo announced that he would retire from Congress at the end of his term, and did not seek re-election in 2018.

==Early life, education, and business career==
Born in Bridgeton, LoBiondo was raised on a farm in the Rosenhayn section of Deerfield Township. He attended Georgetown Preparatory School, and received a B.A. in Business Administration from Saint Joseph&#x27;s University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He worked for twenty-six years in a family-owned trucking company.

==Early political career==
LoBiondo served on the Cumberland County Board of Chosen Freeholders from 1985 to 1987. In 1987, he was elected to New Jersey&#x27;s 1st Legislative district in the lower chamber of the New Jersey General Assembly and served from 1988 to 1994. He won re-election in 1989, 1991, and 1993.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===

In 1992, LoBiondo ran for the U.S. House of Representatives, but was defeated by incumbent Democrat William Hughes by a wide margin. When Hughes declined to run for re-election in 1994, LoBiondo ran again and was elected to the House. He was a member of the Republican freshman class elected in the 1994 midterm election and was part of Speaker Newt Gingrich&#x27;s Contract with America. From that point on, he won every reelection bid with at least 59% of the vote even though he represented a district that was considered marginally Democratic-leaning on paper. In 2012, his district gave President Barack Obama 54% of the vote. In 2016 the district gave President Donald J. Trump a 5-point victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton.

===Embezzlement by campaign treasurer===
On March 4, 2011, Andrew J. McCrosson Jr., who served as treasurer of LoBiondo&#x27;s congressional campaign committee from 1995 until August 2010, pleaded guilty in federal district court to charges of embezzling more than $458,000 from campaign accounts over a fifteen-year period. The charges included one count of wire fraud and one count of converting funds contributed to a federal candidate. LoBiondo&#x27;s campaign attorney called this &quot;an abuse of the trust placed in him by the campaign.&quot; McCrosson was sentenced 30 months in prison.

==Electoral history==


==Political positions==
LoBiondo was a member of the moderate Republican Main Street Partnership. His record on several issues, particularly the environment and labor union votes, fitted a moderate Republican. In 2005, &quot;National Journal&quot; ranked him as the most liberal Republican representative in New Jersey and more liberal than most of New York&#x27;s Republican congressional representatives. Americans for Democratic Action in 2005 placed him in a higher liberal quotient than most of the Republican representatives in those two states.

LoBiondo was ranked as the 13th most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives during the 114th United States Congress (and the most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives from New Jersey) in the Bipartisan Index created by The Lugar Center and the McCourt School of Public Policy that ranks members of the United States Congress by their degree of bipartisanship (by measuring the frequency each member&#x27;s bills attract co-sponsors from the opposite party and each member&#x27;s co-sponsorship of bills by members of the opposite party).

===Abortion===
LoBiondo opposes taxpayer-funded abortion except in cases of incest, rape or threat to the life of the mother. He consistently voted against federal funding for abortion whenever it came to a vote.

===Cannabis===
LoBiondo has a &quot;B&quot; rating from NORML for his voting record regarding cannabis-related matters. He has supported the Veterans Equal Access Amendment, which provides veterans information on accessing medical marijuana based on state law.

===Donald Trump===
He endorsed Chris Christie in the Republican primary. In the general election he supported the GOP ticket but rescinded his support for Republican nominee Donald Trump in October 2016 after the Donald Trump and Billy Bush recording surfaced, but ultimately ended up voting for him.

===Economy===
He voted against the $15¬†billion bailout for GM and Chrysler in 2008. as well as the 2008 Troubled Asset Relief Program. In early 2008, he voted against the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. In December 2017, he voted against the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

===Environment and energy===
LoBiondo has been endorsed by various environmental groups including the League of Conservation Voters. An advocate for renewable energies especially nuclear power, he has consistently opposed offshore drilling off the coast of New Jersey, sponsoring legislation in each Congress during the past decade.

===Foreign policy===
Considered a defense hawk in Congress, LoBiondo was a member of the House Armed Services Committee and joined in the bipartisan support of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In 2013 LoBiondo opposed Obama&#x27;s request for congressional authorization to use force against the Assad regime in Syria.

===Gambling===
In 2012, LoBiondo, along with Democratic congressman Frank Pallone, introduced legislation allowing states to legalize sports betting, then only allowed in four states, arguing it would strengthen Atlantic City as a venue for tourists‚Äô dollars.

===Healthcare===
He is in favor of repealing the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), and voted in favor of the resolution that began the process of repealing Obamacare in January 2017. In 2013, he said that Obamacare was &quot;too deeply flawed to implement and ultimately unworkable.&quot;

===LGBT rights===
LoBiondo was endorsed by Garden State Equality in his 2016 election and a cosponsor of the federal Employment Non-Discrimination Act that would bar discrimination against LGBT individuals in the workplace. In 2011, LoBiondo appeared in an It Gets Better Project video, part of a YouTube campaign reaching out to young gay teens who have been bullied and is a cosponsor of the Safe Schools Improvement Act to respond to bullying of LGBT students in schools.

===Tax reform===
LoBiondo voted no on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. He opposed the bill due to the $10,000 cap on deductions that he described as being &quot;detrimental in my high-tax state of New Jersey.&quot;

===Term limits===
In 1994, LoBiondo pledged to only serve six terms in Congress. In 2004 he announced that he would break his term limits pledge and allow the voters to decide. He retired after twelve terms.

===Veterans===
LoBiondo has made improving VA services in South Jersey a top priority while in Congress, including new clinics in Northfield, Vineland and Cape May Court House (to open in late 2018). He has introduced legislation - the Veterans Health ID Act to allow veterans receive an ID card that allows them care at VA expense at any non-VA medical facility.

<doc id="417468" wikidata="Q5238989" url="?curid=417468" title="David Rendel">
<text>David Digby Rendel (15 April 1949 ‚Äì 16 May 2016) was a British politician for the Liberal Democrats. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Newbury from 1993 to 2005. He won the seat in a by-election in May 1993 caused by the death of Judith Chaplin, and he held it until his defeat at the 2005 general election to Conservative candidate Richard Benyon. At the time he lost his seat he was the Liberal Democrats&#x27; spokesman on Higher and Further Education. In September 2014, Rendel was selected as Liberal Democrat candidate in the 2015 general election for the seat of Somerton and Frome in Somerset; however, he lost to the Conservative candidate, David Warburton.

== Early life ==
Rendel was born in Athens. He was educated at Eton College, Magdalen College, Oxford, and St Cross College, Oxford, Rendel was a member of the winning Oxford boat race crew of 1974. After a gap year volunteering in Africa, he worked in the finance department of Shell Oil Company.

His father Sandy Rendel was a SOE agent and foreign correspondent for &quot;The Times&quot;, and he was a great-grandson of civil engineer Sir Alexander Meadows Rendel, and a great-great-nephew of Liberal MP Stuart Rendel.

== Political career ==
Rendel fought and lost two elections in 1979 and 1983 at Fulham, before moving to Newbury in 1986, when his wife started work as a GP. 
He became a Newbury District Councillor from 1987 to 1995, and fought the Newbury seat unsuccessfully in the 1992 general election, gaining 37% of the votes.

He won the 1993 Newbury by-election with a large majority of 22,055, receiving 65% of the votes. He first came to national attention for supporting the Newbury bypass, and in 1999 stood in the election for the leadership of the Liberal Democrats, but came fifth of five candidates, with Charles Kennedy being elected.

Rendel held on to his seat in 1997 and 2001 with reduced majorities, but at the 2005 election he was defeated by the Conservative candidate, Richard Benyon.
Rendel was a directly elected member of the Liberal Democrats‚Äô Federal Executive committee until 2014.

In May 2006, Rendel was selected by local party members as the Liberal Democrat candidate for the Newbury seat for the next election. At the general election in May 2010, he was again defeated by the sitting Conservative, Richard Benyon, whose majority grew to 21%.

After the election of 2010, Rendel was the only member on the party&#x27;s Federal Executive to vote against the proposal that the party form a coalition government with the Conservatives.

==Death==
Rendel died from cancer in Berkshire on 16 May 2016, aged 67.

== Legacy ==
Lee Dillon, describes Rendel as his political inspiration, complimenting his passion for the constituency. In 2024, Dillon won the Newbury constituency for the Liberal Democrats for the first time since Rendel&#x27;s defeat in 2005.

<text>Jaan Ehlvest (born 14 October 1962) is an Estonian-American chess player. He was awarded the title Grandmaster by FIDE in 1987. Ehlvest was Estonian champion in 1986. Since 2006, he has represented the United States.

He was named Estonian Athlete of the Year in 1987 and 1989. From July 1990 to July 1991, he was among the top 10 on the FIDE world rankings, peaking at number 5 in the list of January 1991.

==Career==
Ehlvest&#x27;s tournament victories include the 1980 USSR Junior Chess Championship, the 1983 European Junior Championship, the 1986 Estonian Championship, the 1994 New York Open, and the 2003 World Open in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. When SK Rockaden won the 2001 Swedish championship they fielded Ehlvest.

He was a member of the gold medal-winning Soviet Union team at the 28th Chess Olympiad in Thessaloniki 1988 and played for Estonia in the Chess Olympiads of 1992‚Äì2004.

In 1997 and 2000, Ehlvest tied for first place at the U.S. Masters Chess Championship.

In 2006, unsatisfied with the lack of support from the Estonian Chess Federation, Ehlvest decided to move to the United States; since then, he has been a member of the USCF and competed internationally for the US.

In March 2007, Ehlvest accepted an invitation to play an eight-game match against the chess program Rybka, one of the strongest chess programs in existence. He was playing Black in all games, but was given pawn odds (Rybka was playing each game a pawn down; a different white pawn was removed in each game). He lost the match by 2¬Ω:5¬Ω (+1‚àí4=3). In a following rematch, the pawn odds were removed, Ehlvest was given White in every game, twice the time on the clock, and significant computational handicaps were placed on the machine. Ehlvest lost decisively, 1¬Ω:4¬Ω.

In 2008 he won the Pan American-Continental Championship, which took place in Boca Raton, Florida.

==Personal life==
Ehlvest&#x27;s younger brother, J√ºri Ehlvest, was a well-known writer in Estonia.

Ehlvest studied psychology at Tartu State University (now, University of Tartu). In 2004, Ehlvest published his autobiography, &quot;The Story of a Chess Player&quot;. While U.S. citizen, he spends most of his time in Estonia.

<text>New Century Forum is a pro-Beijing, middle-class-oriented political group in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The group comprises professionals, businessmen and academics, and aims to represent the voice of the middle-class. It is currently led by convenor Ma Fung-kwok.

==Platform==
The basic platform of the group is to consolidate the power of the middle-class and to protect the long-term interest of Hong Kong. It aims to focus on studying various public policy issues and suggest proposals in a rational and professional manner, on the basis of the &quot;One country-two systems&quot; principle. On political development, it advocates development of a democratic political system in a step by step process. The party is relatively small and its platforms undeveloped.

==History==
The New Century Forum was formed by Ng Ching-fai, then member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong and dean of the Hong Kong Baptist University. Ng resigned from the President of the Baptist University in 2001 and quit the New Century Forum. Ma Fung-kwok, the incumbent convenor, was elected into LegCo by the election committee in 2001, replacing the Ng Ching-fai. With the cancellation of the election committee seats in the 2004 elections, the group had no seat in the LegCo until convenor Ma Fung-kwok won a seat in the Sports, Performing Arts, Culture and Publication in 2012 LegCo election.

The group participated in the direct elections in the 2000 LegCo elections and the 2004 LegCo elections but did not win any seat. Members of the group also contested in the District Council elections but usually ran as independent candidates.

<doc id="417473" wikidata="Q1208851" url="?curid=417473" title="Diana Maddock, Baroness Maddock">
<text>Diana Margaret Pearson Maddock, Baroness Maddock, Lady Beith (&#x27;Derbyshire; 19 May 1945 ‚Äì 26 June 2020) was a British Liberal Democrat politician. She was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Christchurch in a 1993 by-election but lost the seat at the subsequent 1997 general election to Conservative Christopher Chope. She re-entered Parliament as a life peer as Baroness Maddock, of Christchurch in the County of Dorset, in 1997 where she remained until her death.

As of 2024, she and fellow Liberal Democrats, Dame Annette Brooke and Vikki Slade, and Labour&#x27;s Jessica Toale, are the only women to date who represented parliamentary constituencies in Dorset.

==Early life and early career==
Diana Margaret Derbyshire was born in Croydon on 19 May 1945, to Margaret (Evans) and Reginald Derbyshire. She spent her early years in Croydon and Wantage, but after her parents divorced, she was raised by her mother in Lymington, in Hampshire. She was educated at Brockenhurst Grammar School, Shenstone Training College, and Portsmouth Polytechnic (now the University of Portsmouth) and was a teacher of English as a foreign language. She married Bob Maddock in 1966. The couple lived in Sweden for a time, and she credited her time living there as an influence on her political beliefs and went on to serve as President of the Anglo-Swedish Society from 1999 until her death. They returned to England in 1972, and had two daughters.

==Political career==
Maddock joined the Liberal Party in 1976, and was elected to Southampton City Council in 1984. Maddock was not particularly political in her early life. She highlights her initial involvement came when she was pregnant and approached by a canvasser who convinced her to join the Liberal Party having voted for them previously. As she had stopped work, she had more time to be civically engaged which expanded to the point where she became involved with the Association of Liberal Councillors which promoted active engagement with community groups and she realised she enjoyed campaigning. She became leader of the Liberal Democrat group on the council in 1986. While on Southampton City Council Maddock&#x27;s primary areas of interest were housing and energy conservation, and she continued her work in these areas throughout her political career. 

Maddock unsuccessfully contested Southampton Test at the 1992 general election, coming third. She was elected as Member of Parliament for Christchurch at a by-election in 1993 that was caused by the death of Robert Adley, but lost the seat at the 1997 election to the Conservative candidate Christopher Chope. During her time in parliament, she was the Liberal Democrat spokesperson for housing.

She was created a life peer as Baroness Maddock, &quot;of Christchurch in the County of Dorset&quot; on 30 October 1997. From 1998 to 2000, she was President of the Liberal Democrats.

In 2005, she was elected a member of Northumberland County Council for Berwick North Division and in 2007 also to Berwick-upon-Tweed Borough Council for Edward Ward.

Maddock did not re-stand for election to the County Council at the expiry of her term in 2008 and the Borough Council was abolished in 2009 and absorbed into Northumberland County Council.

==Later life==
Her marriage to Bob Maddock ended in divorce in 2000. She married secondly, to Alan Beith, then-MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed, in 2001. She and her husband were one of the few couples who each held peerages in their own right. She died from breast cancer on 26 June 2020, aged 75, at her home in Berwick-upon Tweed, Northumberland.

<doc id="417475" wikidata="Q695061" url="?curid=417475" title="Denis MacShane">
<text>Denis MacShane (born Josef Denis Matyjaszek; 21 May 1948) is a British former politician, author, commentator and convicted criminal who served as Minister of State for Europe from 2002 to 2005. He joined the Labour Party in 1970 and has held most party offices. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Rotherham from 1994 to his forced resignation in 2012.

Born in Glasgow to an Irish mother and Polish father who died from war-related illness in 1958, MacShane was educated on a Middlesex County scholarship at St Benedict&#x27;s School, Ealing and studied at Merton College, Oxford. He worked as a BBC journalist and trade unionist before completing a PhD at Birkbeck, University of London. He contested the Solihull constituency in October 1974 but was unsuccessful. After failing to be selected to contest a constituency at the 1992 general election, he was elected to parliament for Rotherham at a 1994 by-election. Following the 2001 general election, he was appointed a junior minister at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. In April 2002, he became Minister of State for Europe and was appointed to the Privy Council. He returned to the backbenches following the 2005 general election.

In November 2012, Labour suspended MacShane when the Standards and Privileges Committee found he had submitted 19 false invoices &quot;plainly intended to deceive&quot; the parliamentary expenses authority. The allegations, which were made by the British National Party, had been investigated for 20 months by the Metropolitan Police. After the Commons upheld the complaint, he announced his intention to resign as MP for Rotherham and from the Privy Council. In November 2013, he pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to false accounting by submitting false receipts for ¬£12,900. On 23 December, he was sentenced to six months in prison. He served four months of his sentence in HM Prison Belmarsh and HM Prison Brixton, and the rest by wearing an electronic tag.

== Early life and career ==
MacShane was born on 21 May 1948 in Glasgow as Josef Denis Matyjaszek to an Irish mother, Isobel MacShane, and Jozef Matyjaszek, a Pole who had fought in the Second World War and remained in exile, taking British nationality in 1950. He was educated at the independent St Benedict&#x27;s School in Ealing, before going on to study at Merton College, Oxford.

MacShane worked for the BBC from 1969 to 1977, including as a newsreader and reporter on Wolverhampton Wanderers for BBC Radio Birmingham. He changed his surname to his mother&#x27;s maiden name at the request of his employers. He was fired by the BBC after using a fake name to call the radio phone-in programme he worked on at the time. During the call, MacShane accused leading Conservative politician Reginald Maudling, who had been forced to resign as a frontbencher after accusations of financial impropriety in 1972, of being a crook. The MP threatened to sue as a result.

MacShane supported the Solidarity trade union in Poland, where he was arrested in 1982 for attending a demonstration and deported. He became an activist for the National Union of Journalists and later its president 1978 to 1979. He was policy director of the International Metal Workers&#x27; Federation from 1980 to 1992, and he completed a PhD in international economics at Birkbeck, University of London in 1990.

==Political career==
MacShane first contested a parliamentary seat at the October 1974 general election, where he failed to win Solihull. In 1984, he was on the short list for Labour Party Communications Director, but Peter Mandelson was appointed instead. For the 1992 general election, he attempted to secure a nomination for the Coventry South East constituency, then Neath, and finally Rotherham, though all the attempts were unsuccessful.

MacShane was elected to the House of Commons in the 1994 Rotherham by-election. He was a member of the Deregulation Select Committee 1996‚Äì1997, and served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to a succession of ministers in the 1997‚Äì2001 Parliament.

===Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign Office===
Following the 2001 general election, MacShane was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs on 11 June 2001, with responsibility for the Balkans and Latin America. He caused some embarrassment to the government in 2002 by describing President Hugo Ch√°vez of Venezuela as a &#x27;ranting, populist demagogue&#x27; and compared him to Benito Mussolini during a failed military coup attempt to depose the democratically elected president. Afterwards, he had to make clear that, as minister with responsibility for Latin America, the government deplored the coup attempt.

In November 2001, an article supportive of the war in Afghanistan was published in &quot;The Observer&quot; under the name of Muslim Labour MP Khalid Mahmood, headlined &quot;The Five Myths Muslims Must Deny&quot;. A few days later however, it was revealed that the article had not in fact been written by Mahmood, but by MacShane; Mahmood had agreed to put his name to the article after Lord Ahmed of Rotherham had refused. Mahmood&#x27;s actions were condemned by Inayat Bunglawala from the Muslim Council of Britain, who said that &quot;[after] Lord Ahmed refused, MacShane then found Mahmood‚Äîuniversally regarded as being not exactly the brightest spark in parliament‚Äîto be a more willing instrument for his scheme&quot;.

===Minister for Europe===
In 2002, he became Minister for Europe in the reshuffle caused by the resignation of Estelle Morris. He was appointed a member of the Privy Council in 2005.

MacShane was a supporter of the 2003 invasion of Iraq and strongly supported Tony Blair&#x27;s foreign policy, including in relation to the Middle East. Later in 2003, he criticised Muslim community leaders, saying they did not do enough to condemn acts of Islamic terrorism.

During a meeting of Durham Labour Students in 2004, MacShane described Gordon Brown&#x27;s five economic tests for joining the European single currency as, &quot;a bit of a giant red herring.&quot; When contacted by &quot;The Scotsman&quot; newspaper about whether or not he made the comments, he responded: &quot;Jesus Christ, no. I mean, &#x27;red herring&#x27; is not one of my favourite metaphors. If you think any Labour MP saying the Prime Minister&#x27;s most important policy is a red herring, then they would not survive long in the job.&quot; He had been recorded on a dictaphone, and the tape was played on both the &quot;Today&quot; programme and BBC News 24. MacShane wrote in &quot;Tribune&quot;, &quot;I have no idea why I was removed as a minister, and it does not worry me in the slightest.&quot;

In March 2005, MacShane signed on to the Henry Jackson Society principles, advocating a proactive approach to the spread of liberal democracy across the world, including by military intervention. The society also supports &quot;European military modernisation and integration under British leadership&quot;.

Following the 2005 general election, MacShane was dropped from the government. After returning to the backbenches in 2005, he was appointed as a delegate to the Council of Europe and the NATO Parliamentary Assembly.

===Other issues and incidents===
While MacShane has campaigned on the issue of sex trafficking, he was accused of repeatedly using false statistics in order to inflate the number of female victims. In January 2007, he stated, &quot;According to Home Office estimates, 25,000 sex slaves currently work in the massage parlours and brothels of Britain.&quot; He repeated the figure in a 2008 debate, attributing it to the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; newspaper. It was later claimed that no such figure exists as an estimate.

On 17 December 2008, he initiated a debate about Britain&#x27;s libel laws in Parliament. Specifically, he described how the United Kingdom has become a destination for libel tourists as well as how various jurisdictions in the United States (including the U.S. states of New York and Illinois and the federal government) were ready to pass measures designed to halt, at the minimum, reciprocal enforcement of civil judgments related to libel with the United Kingdom, and quite possibly, to allow countersuit, and the award of treble damages in the United States against any person bringing a libel action in a non-US court against US publications or websites.

On 25 August 2010, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that MacShane admitted he was the MP involved in an incident with a volunteer with the new Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority: &quot;On 11 May a volunteer had an encounter with an MP who was described as &#x27;very difficult ... disruptive [and] angry&quot; during an induction session. The official report said: &#x27;At the 10-minute mark the volunteer burst into tears and a staff member [from Ipsa] attempted to intervene. When the staff member offered to help, the MP dismissed him as &#x27;condescending&#x27;, at which point another staff member pulled the volunteer (still in tears) out of the session.&#x27; MacShane apologised for his conduct.

MacShane was publicly criticised by the Association of Political Thought for wrongly accusing London School of Economics professor of political and gender theory Anne Phillips of supporting prostitution and filling the minds of her students with &quot;poisonous drivel&quot;. As evidence of her supposed support for the latter, he cited a question from an LSE reading list about the ethical differences between legal waged labour and prostitution. MacShane later admitted that he had taken the question &#x27;out of context&#x27;. Labour MP Fiona Mactaggart subsequently called Professor Phillips&#x27; views &quot;frankly nauseating&quot; on the basis of the same evidence.

MacShane was a Patron of Supporters of Nuclear Energy, and supported the development of a nuclear industry manufacturing centre in Rotherham. MacShane was employed as an advisor by United Utilities, Britain&#x27;s largest water company, during 2006 and 2007.

MacShane was MP for Rotherham during the period of large-scale sexual abuse of children in the constituency. After the publication of the &quot;Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Exploitation in Rotherham&quot; he said in a BBC radio interview that no-one had come to him with child abuse allegations during that period, but that he should have been more involved in the issue. Saying that he had done too little, he said he had been aware of what he saw as the problems of cousin marriage and the oppression of women within parts of the Muslim community in Britain, but: &quot;Perhaps yes, as a true &quot;Guardian&quot; reader, and liberal leftie, I suppose I didn&#x27;t want to raise that too hard. I think there was a culture of not wanting to rock the multicultural community boat if I may put it like that.&quot;

Another issue on which MacShane was active as a parliamentarian was combating antisemitism. He was chair of the inquiry panel of the All-Party Parliamentary Group against Antisemitism, which reported in September 2006. In March 2009, he became chairman of a think-tank on antisemitism, the European Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism.

MacShane was an advisory board member of the now defunct Just Journalism, an organisation focused on how UK media reported Israel and the Middle East. Just Journalism had strong links with the Henry Jackson Society, and shared an office with it.

==Parliamentary expenses, resignation and conviction==

===Newspaper reports and general parliamentary review===
As part of the review of all MPs expenses, MacShane was ordered to repay ¬£1,507.73 in wrongfully claimed expenses, with his appeals against the ruling being rejected. He was also alleged to have passed twelve invoices from the &quot;European Policy Institute&quot; for &quot;research and translation&quot; expenses to the parliamentary authorities, and claimed for eight laptop computers in three years. A number of newspapers stated that the EPI was &quot;controlled&quot; by MacShane&#x27;s brother, Edmund Matyjaszek, a claim which MacShane denied: &quot;The EPI was set up 20 years ago by a network of people on the Left working in Europe and the US... Ed is my brother, but simply administrates it.&quot;

MacShane had written an article for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in which he played down the expenses scandal, writing, &quot;There will come a moment when moats and manure, bath plugs and tampons will be seen as a wonderful moment of British fiddling, but more on a Dad&#x27;s Army scale than the real corruption of politics.&quot; In 2008, MacShane supported House of Commons Speaker Michael Martin, calling for Conservative Douglas Carswell to be disciplined for saying that Martin should resign for failing to do enough to prevent the abuse of parliamentary expense claims.

===Resumed parliamentary investigation===
At the end of their enquiry, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided to close the file. MacShane was re-admitted to the Labour Party in July 2012, but was then suspended again by the Labour Party on 2 November 2012 after a parliamentary committee found that he had submitted 19 false invoices for expenses that were &quot;plainly intended to deceive&quot;. Later that day, MacShane announced that he would be resigning from Parliament. He said: &quot;I have decided for the sake of my wonderful constituency of Rotherham and my beloved Labour Party to resign as an MP by applying for the Chiltern Hundreds or as guided by the House authorities. I love the House of Commons and I hope by resigning I can serve by showing that MPs must take responsibility for their mistakes and accept the consequences of being in breach of the House rules&quot;.

He said in a statement: &quot;Clearly I deeply regret that the way I chose to be reimbursed for costs related to my work in Europe and in combating antisemitism, including being the Prime Minister&#x27;s personal envoy, has been judged so harshly.&quot; However, the Standards and Privileges Committee stated that the Commons had placed strict conditions and limits on funding MPs&#x27; travel to Europe, MacShane was clearly aware of these rules, and concluded &quot;Mr MacShane claimed in the way he did to ensure that his use of public funds for his European travel was not challenged&quot; by sending misleading invoices to himself in order to claim the costs of travelling and to entertain European contacts.

===Referral to police and conviction===
It was reported on 14 October 2010 that the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards (on instruction from the Standards and Privileges Committee) had referred an expenses-related complaint about MacShane from the British National Party to the Metropolitan Police. The matter referred was his claiming of expenses totalling ¬£125,000 for his constituency office, the office being his garage. The Labour Party suspended MacShane from the parliamentary party pending the outcome.

In June 2011, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; highlighted further discrepancies in MacShane&#x27;s expenses which had been uncovered by former independent candidate Peter Thirlwall. As a result, he held an emergency meeting with House of Commons officials and agreed to repay a further ¬£3,051.38. The lengthy investigation concluded on 4 July 2012 with an announcement that the Metropolitan Police would take no further action, but it was reported on 21 January 2013 that the police were to re-open the expenses claims investigation involving MacShane.

On 11 July 2013 the Crown Prosecution Service announced that MacShane would be charged with false accounting under the Theft Act 1968, involving the creation of ¬£12,900 of fake receipts. He continued to write columns for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, as well as appearing on television programmes relating to European affairs both in Britain and in other European countries. On 18 November 2013 he pleaded guilty to false accounting at the Old Bailey, and on 23 December 2013 was jailed for six months. He served his sentence in HM Prison Belmarsh and HM Prison Brixton, and subsequently by wearing an electronic tag.

MacShane resigned his Privy Council membership in 2013, after discussions with the body&#x27;s secretariat. After MacShane was forced to resign his seat, Martin Bright in &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; wrote that his &quot;fall from grace has been a blow for those who share his concerns about extremist politics, whether it is radical Islamism in the Middle East, neo-fascism at home or the rise of ultranationalist groups in Eastern Europe.&quot; In November 2013, Bright described MacShane as &quot;one of&quot; the Jewish community&#x27;s &quot;greatest champions&quot;.

===European Parliament incident===
Shortly after being released from prison in 2014, UKIP MEPs alleged MacShane was ejected from the premises of the European Parliament members&#x27; bar where he had been meeting UKIP leader Nigel Farage, after a British MEP accused him of loitering in the building &quot;like a bad smell&quot; and told officials he had no right to be there. MacShane was reported to be seeking a communications job.

===Books===

In his 2014 book &quot;Prison Diaries&quot; MacShane detailed his life in prison, in which he claimed to hold the status of &quot;politician prisoner&quot;. He has written more than ten books on European politics including three on Brexit about which he writes and broadcasts regularly in Britain and Europe. He is the author of several books on European politics, most notably &quot;Brexit: How Britain will Leave Europe&quot;, written in 2014, which warned that the EU referendum in the UK would result in a vote to quit Europe. His follow-up book, &quot;Brexiternity: The Uncertain Fate of Britain&quot;, argues that Brexit will dominate British politics, economics and international relations for years to come.

<doc id="417476" wikidata="Q1331326" url="?curid=417476" title="Elizabeth Symons, Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean">
<text>Elizabeth Conway Symons, Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean (born 14 April 1951) is a British politician and trade unionist. A member of the Labour Party, she was Minister of State for the Middle East from 2001 to 2005. She is former General Secretary of the FDA Trade Union and has served as the Chair of the Arab British Chamber of Commerce (ABCC) since 2010.

==Early life==
The daughter of Ernest Symons, Chairman of HM Board of Inland Revenue, Symons was educated at Putney High School for Girls and Girton College, Cambridge. She was an administration trainee at the Department of the Environment from 1974 to 1977. She then worked for the Inland Revenue Staff Federation from 1977 to 1989 and was General Secretary of the Association of First Division Civil Servants from 1989 to 1997. She resigned from this post following her appointment as a working peer.

==Political life==

Symons was created a Labour life peer as Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean, &quot;of Vernham Dean in the County of Hampshire&quot;, on 7 October 1996. From May 1997 to June 1999, she took her first government post, serving as a junior Foreign Office Minister. From 1999 until 2001, she was Minister of State for Defence Procurement and, from 2001 until 2003, Minister of State for Trade. From 2001 until 2005, she was Minister of State for Foreign Affairs with responsibility for the Middle East, International Security, Consular and Personal Affairs, and Deputy Leader of the House of Lords.

Symons was or remains a member of the British-American Project (BAP). It has a membership of 600 leaders and opinion formers, drawn equally from both countries, according to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and holds an annual conference at which everything that is said is officially off-the-record. She also serves on the board of governors of the Ditchley Foundation.

In 2001, she married her long-standing partner, Phil Bassett, a former writer at &quot;The Times&quot;. They have a son. In October 2002, Bassett was appointed to the Strategic Communications Unit in 10 Downing Street, leaving in September 2003 to become special adviser to Lord Falconer of Thoroton, the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs.

She is a Senior Network Member at the European Leadership Network (ELN).

===Corporate career===
Symons was not given a job in the re-shuffle after the general election of 5 May 2005, and became a non-executive director of British Airways.

Symons sits on the board of trustees of the John Smith Memorial Trust, an NGO set up in 1995 in memory of the late Labour party leader John Smith.

==Conflict of interest allegations==

&quot;The Guardian&quot; alleged in its issue of 9 January 2005 that Symons may have used her office to give &quot;special treatment&quot; to David Mills, husband of Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell. Mills was seeking her assistance in sidestepping a U.S. trade embargo against Iran in order to sell $200 million worth of British Aerospace jets to that country.

On 9 February 2006, &quot;The Guardian&quot; mentioned her as one several former government ministers who had accepted lucrative positions as company directors and consultants. In the case of Symons, the companies involved were British Airways, law firm DLA Piper, and the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&amp;O).

In 2009 similar allegations were made when she took a lucrative post with UK investment bank MerchantBridge, which made millions from contracts in post-war Iraq, and also when she became a member of the National Economic Development Board of Libya shortly before the release of Abdelbaset Al Megrahi, who was convicted of the Lockerbie bombing. Symons resigned from the National Economic Development Board in 2011 in the midst of a popular uprising against the government of Muammar Gaddafi, one day after she had made remarks which appeared to praise Gaddafi&#x27;s &#x27;sound ideology&#x27;. Symons said the remarks had been made facetiously.

<text>Day for Night () is a 1973 romantic comedy-drama film co-written and directed by Fran√ßois Truffaut. The metafictional and self-reflexive film chronicles the troubled production of a melodrama, and the various personal and professional challenges of the cast and crew. It stars Jacqueline Bisset, Valentina Cortese, Jean-Pierre Aumont, Dani, Alexandra Stewart, Jean-Pierre L√©aud and Truffaut himself. 

The film premiered out of competition at the 1973 Cannes Film Festival and won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film the following year. At the 1975 Oscars, the film was nominated for Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actress for Valentina Cortese. The film also won three BAFTA Awards, for Best Film, Best Direction, and Best Actress in a Supporting Role for Cortese. 

Retrospective reviews have appraised &quot;Day for Night&quot; as one of Truffaut&#x27;s best films, and one of the greatest films of all time.

== Title ==
The original French title, La Nuit am√©ricaine, refers to the French name for the filmmaking process whereby sequences filmed outdoors in daylight are shot with a filter over the camera lens (a technique described in the dialogue of Truffaut&#x27;s film) or also using film stock balanced for tungsten (indoor) light and underexposed (or adjusted during post-production) to appear as if they are taking place at night. In English, the technique is called day for night.

==Plot==
The film chronicles the production of &quot;Je vous pr√©sente Pam√©la&quot; (&quot;Meet Pamela&quot;, or literally &quot;I Introduce You to Pamela&quot;), a clich√©d melodrama starring aging screen icon Alexandre, former Italian diva S√©verine, young heartthrob Alphonse and British actress Julie Baker, who is recovering from both a nervous breakdown and the controversy over her marriage to her much older doctor.

In between are several vignettes chronicling the stories of the crew members and the director, Ferrand, who deals with the practical problems of making a film. Behind the camera, the actors and crew experience several romances, affairs, break-ups and sorrows. The production is especially shaken up when one of the supporting actresses is revealed to be pregnant. 

Later, Alphonse&#x27;s lover leaves him for the film&#x27;s stuntman, which leads Alphonse into a palliative one-night stand with an accommodating Julie; thereupon, mistaking Julie&#x27;s pity for true love, the infantile Alphonse informs Julie&#x27;s husband of the affair. Finally, Alexandre dies on the way to hospital after a car accident.

==Cast==
== Themes ==
One of the film&#x27;s themes is whether cinema is more important than life to those who make it. It makes many allusions both to filmmaking and to movies themselves, perhaps unsurprisingly since Truffaut began his career as a film critic who championed cinema as an art form. The film opens with a picture of Lillian and Dorothy Gish, to whom it is dedicated. In one scene, Ferrand opens a package of books he has ordered on directors such as Luis Bu√±uel, Carl Theodor Dreyer, Ingmar Bergman, Alfred Hitchcock, Howard Hawks, Jean-Luc Godard, Ernst Lubitsch, Roberto Rossellini and Robert Bresson. 

The film&#x27;s French title could sound like &quot;L&#x27;ennui am√©ricain&quot; (&quot;American boredom&quot;): Truffaut wrote elsewhere of the way French cinema critics inevitably make this pun of any title that uses &quot;nuit&quot;. Here, he deliberately invites his viewers to recognise the artificiality of cinema, particularly American-style studio film, with its reliance on effects such as day for night, that &quot;Je vous pr√©sente Pam√©la&quot; exemplifies.

==Production==
The film was based on an original idea by Truffaut who said he wanted the picture to do for film what &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; did for books &quot;to show why it is good to love the cinema&quot;. He dedicated the film to Dorothy and Lillian Gish, whom Truffaut called &quot;the first two actresses of the cinema&quot;; he said the film was made in &quot;the spirit of friendship for all the people in the movie business&quot;.

=== Casting ===
Truffaut used international actors because he felt French cinema did not have the mythological aspect he wanted. He said the film was influenced by &quot;The Golden Coach&quot; and &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; (both 1952); the latter was his favourite film about filmmaking because it showed everyone involved in a film, not just the director and star. 

Jacqueline Bisset was cast in part because she spoke French. &quot;I was so flattered when he [Truffaut] called&quot;, said Bisset. &quot;It&#x27;s wonderful to work with someone who likes working with women&quot;.

=== Filming ===
The film was shot mainly in Nice on an enormous set for a Paris street originally built by an American company and used for &quot;Lady L&quot; (1965) and &quot;The Madwoman of Chaillot&quot; (1969). Truffaut got the idea while editing &quot;Two English Girls&quot; (1971).

Author Graham Greene makes a cameo appearance as an insurance company representative, billed as &quot;Henry Graham&quot;. On the film&#x27;s DVD, it was reported that Greene was a great admirer of Truffaut, and had always wanted to meet him, so when the small part came up where he actually talks to the director, he was delighted to have the opportunity. It was reported that Truffaut was disappointed he was not told until later that the actor playing the insurance company representative was Greene, as he would have liked to have made his acquaintance, being an admirer of Greene&#x27;s work.

Truffaut took a sabbatical after making the film.

== Reception ==
===Critical response===
The film is often considered one of Truffaut&#x27;s best. It is one of two Truffaut films on &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 Best Films of the Century, along with &quot;The 400 Blows&quot; (1959). It has also been called &quot;the most beloved film ever made about filmmaking&quot;.

Roger Ebert gave the film four stars out of four, writing, &quot;it is not only the best movie ever made about the movies but is also a great entertainment.&quot; He added it to his &quot;The Great Movies&quot; list in 1997. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;hilarious, wise and moving,&quot; with &quot;superb&quot; performances. Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film four stars out of four, calling it &quot;a movie about the making of a movie; it also is a wonderfully tender story of the fragile, funny, and tough people who populate the film business.&quot; He named it the best film of 1973 in his year-end list. Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called the film &quot;a return to form&quot; for Truffaut, &quot;though it&#x27;s a return only to form.&quot; She added, &quot;It has a pretty touch. But when it was over, I found myself thinking, Can this be all there is to it? The picture has no center and not much spirit.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;one of the most sheerly enjoyable movies of any year, for any audience. For those who love the movies as Truffault loves them, &#x27;Day for Night&#x27; is a very special testament of that love.&quot; Richard Combs of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote, &quot;Easily classifiable as a lightweight work, and never digging much below the surface of either its characters or its director&#x27;s particular concept of cinema, the film still manages to be an delight simply because of the √©lan and ingenious craftsmanship with which its traditionally dangerous, self-conscious format is handled.&quot; 

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 98% based on 40 reviews, with an average score of 8.50/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;A sweet counterpoint to Godard&#x27;s &quot;Contempt&quot;, Truffaut&#x27;s &quot;Day for Night&quot; is a congenial tribute to the self-afflicted madness that is making a movie&quot;.

Jean-Luc Godard walked out of &quot;Day for Night&quot; in disgust, and accused Truffaut of making a film that was a &quot;lie&quot;. Truffaut responded with a long letter critical of Godard, and the two former friends never met again.

<text>Margaret Eve Hodge, Baroness Hodge of Barking (, formerly Watson; born 8 September 1944), is a British politician and life peer, who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Barking from 1994 to 2024. A member of the Labour Party, she was previously Leader of Islington London Borough Council from 1982 to 1992. She has held a number of ministerial roles and served as chair of the Public Accounts Committee from 2010 to 2015.

Hodge is the daughter of the co-founder of steel firm Stemcor and remains a major shareholder. She was a councillor on Islington Council from 1973 to 1994, was chair of the Housing Committee, and then Council Leader from 1982 to 1992. Hodge later apologised for failing to ensure that allegations of serious child abuse in council-run homes were sufficiently investigated and for libelling a complainant.

Hodge was elected to parliament in a 1994 by-election. She was appointed Junior Minister for Disabled People in 1998 and promoted to Minister for Universities in 2001, subsequently becoming the first Children&#x27;s Minister in 2003, joining the Privy Council. In 2005, Hodge became Minister of State for Work. Hodge served as Minister of State for Culture and Tourism from 2007 to 2008 and 2009 until Labour was defeated at the 2010 general election. Hodge remained as a backbench MP for Barking until 2024. She was awarded a life peerage in 2024 Dissolution Honours taking her seat in the House of Lords in September 2024.

==Early life==
Hodge was born on 8 September 1944 in Alexandria, Egypt, to Jewish refugee parents Hans Oppenheimer (1908‚Äì1985), and his wife Lisbeth (&quot;n√©e&quot; Hollitscher). Hans Oppenheimer left Stuttgart in Germany during the 1930s to join his uncle&#x27;s metals business based in Cairo and Alexandria, where he met fellow √©migr√©e, Austrian-born Lisbeth Hollitscher. Married in 1936, Hans and Lisbeth went on to have five children: four girls and a boy.

At the outset of World War II, the couple and their eldest daughter were rendered stateless, effectively stranded in the Kingdom of Egypt for the duration of the War. They decided to leave Egypt in 1948, concerned that antisemitism had increased in the Middle East during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The family moved to Orpington, Kent (present-day Greater London), where they started their family-owned steel-trading corporation, Stemcor. It is now one of the world&#x27;s largest privately held steel companies, with an annual turnover of over ¬£6 billion in 2011. Hodge is a major shareholder, listing her holdings in the Parliamentary Register of Members&#x27; Interests. Stemcor was run by her brother, Ralph, until September 2013.

When Hodge was 10 years old, in 1954, her mother died of stomach cancer. Hodge attended Bromley High School, followed by Oxford High School as a boarder. She went on to study at the London School of Economics, graduating in 1966 with a third-class honours degree in government studies. After working briefly on television political programmes, she began, but did not complete, a master&#x27;s degree in philosophy at Bedford College, London.

Hodge supported the CND Aldermaston Marches and protests over the Vietnam war.

==Early career==
From 1966 to 1971, Hodge worked in market research at Unilever, and in PR at Weber Shandwick. From 1992 to 1994, she was a senior consultant at Price Waterhouse.

==Islington Council==
Hodge was first elected as a Councillor for the London Borough of Islington at a by-election in 1973, representing the Barnsbury ward. She became chair of the Housing Committee in 1975. This was an important post in a local authority which had one of the worst set of housing statistics in London during a period when London boroughs were required to be housing providers and managers. Hodge&#x27;s tenure as Housing Chairman oversaw the continuation of a large new housing programme. There was a change of emphasis to the refurbishment of sound older buildings (&quot;e.g.&quot; Charteris Road, Alexander Road areas), in response to a paper published by the Islington Housing Action Group.

The Islington Labour Party was badly affected by the defection of members and elected representatives to the Social Democratic Party. In the 1978 council election she was elected to Thornhill ward, before representing Barnsbury again at the 1982 election, and moving to Sussex ward at the 1986 election.

After Labour won all but one of the council seats in the 1982 council election on a strong left-wing manifesto, Hodge became Council Leader, a post she held until 1992. In 1984 Hodge was a public leader of Islington participating in the rate-capping rebellion to the Conservative government&#x27;s imposition of spending restrictions on councils, setting no council rate. As with other councils, the district auditor ordered Islington to set a legal rate, which it complied with hours before the deadline. Hodge and the council were often portrayed as part of the &quot;loony left&quot; by some newspapers. In 1994 Hodge was disqualified as a councillor after not attending council meetings for over six months; Hodge stated she had not been active out of respect for the new council leadership.

===Child abuse controversy===
The end of Hodge&#x27;s service on Islington Council, prior to her entering Parliament, was marred by the emergence of serious child abuse allegations concerning Council-run children&#x27;s homes in Islington. She has apologised several times since the emergence of the scandal in the 1980s that directly linked her council tenure with what she admitted in 2014 was &quot;shameful naivety&quot; in ignoring the complaints of paedophile victims.

In 1985, Demetrios Panton wrote to Islington Council to complain about abuse suffered while in Council care during the 1970s and 1980s. Panton received an official response in 1989, in which the Council denied all responsibility. In 1990, Liz Davies, a senior social worker employed by the borough, with her manager, David Cofie, raised concerns about sexual abuse of children under the care of Islington Council. Correspondence between Hodge and the then Director of Social Work indicates that Hodge declined a request for extra investigative resources. Instead, the Cofie‚ÄìDavies investigation was dismissed by council officials in May 1990 after the police declared they had found insufficient evidence of abuse; despite this, the two social workers continued their enquiries.

In 1992, the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; resumed reporting allegations of abuse in the Islington Care Homes. Its initial report was slated by Hodge as a &quot;sensationalist piece of gutter journalism&quot;, although she has since apologised, claiming that her officials had given her false information. In 1995, the &quot;White Report&quot; into sexual abuse in Islington Care Homes confirmed that the council had failed to adequately investigate the allegations, claiming that its doctrinaire interpretation of equal opportunities created a climate of fear at being labelled homophobic.

In 2003, following Hodge&#x27;s appointment as Minister for Children, Panton went public with his allegations that he had been the subject of abuse in Islington Council care and that, although he had repeatedly raised the matter, he had been ignored. He identified Hodge&#x27;s complacency as ultimately responsible for the abuse that he alleged he had suffered. Liz Davies simultaneously went public regarding the concerns she had previously raised while working for the council. Following a media campaign by several national newspapers calling for Hodge to resign from her new post, she wrote to Panton, apologising for referring to him as &quot;an extremely disturbed person&quot; in an earlier letter to the Chairman of the BBC Gavyn Davies, which had been broadcast on Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; programme. This was subsequently brought to the floor of the House of Commons in Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions by opposition leader Michael Howard. A formal apology to Panton was made in the High Court on 19 November 2003 by Lady Hodge&#x27;s barrister together with a financial settlement of ¬£30,000.

In April 2014, Education Secretary Michael Gove instigated investigations into 21 children&#x27;s homes nationally, where new evidence suggested Jimmy Savile might have abused young people, including one in Islington during the period Hodge was leader. This prompted Hodge to issue a further apology stating &quot;our naivety was shameful&quot;. The investigation failed to reach any firm conclusions.

==Parliamentary career==
Hodge served as the Labour MP for Barking after winning the by-election on 9 June 1994 following the death of Jo Richardson. Whilst still a new MP, she endorsed the candidature of Tony Blair, a former Islington neighbour, for the Labour Party leadership, following the sudden death of John Smith from a heart attack. In 2017, she had a majority of 21,608. On 2 December 2021 she announced she would not be standing at the next general election, and she ceased to be an MP in June 2024.

===Ministerial roles===
Hodge was appointed Junior Minister for Disabled People in 1998 and was promoted Minister for Universities at the new Department for Education and Skills in 2001, in which capacity she piloted the controversial Higher Education Act 2004, remaining in post until 2003, when she became the inaugural Children&#x27;s Minister. She was sworn into the Privy Council on 22 June 2003.

In 2003, Hodge was appointed to the newly created high-profile role of Children&#x27;s minister, which included responsibility for Special Education, Early Years Education and Childcare, the Young People&#x27;s Unit, teenage pregnancy, the Family Policy Unit, and general responsibility for child welfare.

In 2005, Hodge was moved to become Minister of State for Work. On 17 June 2005, she was criticised for saying that former employees of MG Rover would be able to obtain jobs at Tesco, a local supermarket. Later, she claimed that this was not what she meant, rather that she had empathy for those losing their jobs, and was pointing to a new Tesco supermarket as an example of new jobs being created in the area in face of the redundancies at the car manufacturing plant.

On 27 June 2007, Hodge was reappointed Minister of State in the Department for Culture by new Prime Minister Gordon Brown. As Minister of State for Culture, Creative Industries and Tourism, she was quick to criticise Britain&#x27;s foremost classical music festival, The Proms, for not being sufficiently inclusive, instead praising popular television shows such as &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. Following the Cabinet reshuffle of 3 October 2008, it was announced that Hodge was &quot;temporarily leaving Government on compassionate grounds of family illness and will return to Government in the Spring&quot;. While she was absent from the Government, she was temporarily replaced as Minister of State by Barbara Follett. Hodge was reappointed Minister of State responsible for Culture and Tourism on 22 September 2009. In January 2010, Hodge announced that Royal Parks, which manages Richmond Park and Bushy Park in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames among others, was to be allowed to charge car drivers ¬£2 per visit. This announcement sparked protests in South London and was opposed by local politicians including Conservative Zac Goldsmith, Liberal Democrats Sir Vince Cable and Baroness Kramer.

===Barking and the BNP===

Hodge once called for British-born families to have priority on council house waiting lists over immigrants. This comment received praise from the far-right political party the BNP and led to calls for Hodge to resign. However, her comments would be defended by her colleagues.

In April 2006, Hodge commented in an interview with &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; that eight out of ten white working class voters in her constituency might be tempted to vote for the British National Party (BNP) at the May 2006 local elections because &quot;no one else is listening to them&quot; about their concerns over unemployment, high house prices and the housing of asylum seekers in the area. She said the Labour Party must promote &quot;very, very strongly the benefits of the new, rich multi-racial society which is part of this part of London for me&quot;. There was widespread media coverage of her remarks, and Hodge was strongly criticised for giving the BNP publicity. The BNP went on to gain eleven council seats at the 2006 election out of a total of 51, making them the second-largest party. It was reported that Labour activists accused Hodge of generating hundreds of extra votes for the BNP, and that local members began to privately discuss the possibility of a move to deselect her. The GMB wrote to Hodge in May 2006, demanding her resignation.

Writing in &quot;The Observer&quot; on 20 May 2007 Hodge argued that established families should take priority in the allocation of social housing over new economic migrants, stating that &quot;We should look at policies where the legitimate sense of entitlement felt by the indigenous family overrides the legitimate need demonstrated by the new migrants.&quot; Her comments were condemned by the Refugee Council and other representative bodies.

In November 2009, the Leader of the BNP, Nick Griffin, announced that he intended to contest the Barking seat at the 2010 general election. In spite of the union&#x27;s position, Hodge was the Labour candidate and was returned as the Member of Parliament, doubling her majority, whilst Griffin finished in third place behind the Conservatives. The BNP lost all their council seats in the 2010 election.

===Public Accounts Committee===
On 10 June 2010 Hodge was elected by MPs to the Chair of the Public Accounts Committee in the fifth round of voting using the single transferable vote system. According to Peter Riddell, under Hodge&#x27;s leadership, the PAC has held civil servants to account using procedure contrary to established practice. Gus O&#x27;Donnell, then head of the civil service, accused her of presiding over a &quot;theatrical exercise in public humiliation&quot;, while Alan Duncan accused her of being &quot;abusive and bullying&quot; towards Rona Fairhead.

The Oppenheimers&#x27; family company, Stemcor, which had been founded by Hodge&#x27;s father, Hans Oppenheimer, was run by her brother, Ralph, until September 2013. In November 2012, Helia Ebrahimi, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;‚Ä≥s City Correspondent, raised the issue of Hodge&#x27;s suitability as chair of the Public Accounts Committee, reporting that her family&#x27;s company &quot;pays just 0.01pc tax on ¬£2.1bn of business generated in the UK&quot;. This led to an investigation into the tax arrangements of a number of American companies operating in the United Kingdom. In April 2015, &quot;The Times&quot; reported that Hodge had benefited from the closure in 2011 of a Liechtenstein foundation which held shares in Stemcor, using the Liechtenstein Disclosure Facility, a legal means of returning undisclosed assets to the UK with reduced penalties. Hodge gained 96,000 shares worth ¬£1,500,000 as a result. Hodge said she had played no part in administering or establishing the scheme. She explained: &quot;All I could do as a shareholder in a company not run by me, and over which I had no influence or control, was to ensure that any shares I held were above board and that I paid all relevant taxes in full. Every time I received any benefit from the company this happened.&quot;

Shortly after Labour&#x27;s defeat at the 2015 general election, it emerged that Hodge would not be standing for re-election to the Public Accounts Committee. She was succeeded as Chair in June 2015 by Meg Hillier. Hodge has since written a book about her time as chair of the Public Accounts Committee entitled &quot;Called to Account&quot;.

=== Garden Bridge Project review ===
In September 2016, London Mayor Sadiq Khan asked Hodge to review the Garden Bridge project. Hodge was tasked with determining whether value for money was achieved from the taxpayers&#x27; ¬£60 million contribution to the bridge, as well as investigating whether transparency standards were met by public bodies. Hodge&#x27;s review was published in April 2017. Hodge recommended that &#x27;It would be better for the taxpayer to accept the financial loss of cancelling the project than to risk the potential uncertain additional costs to the public purse if the project proceeds.&#x27; The report found that decisions on the Garden Bridge were driven more by electoral cycles than value for taxpayers&#x27; money, and that there was not an open, fair and competitive process around two procurements. In response, the BBC&#x27;s transport correspondent, Tom Edwards, reported that &#x27;I can&#x27;t remember reading a report so damning of a transport project.&#x27;

In June 2017, Andrew Boff, a Conservative member of the London Assembly, criticised Margaret Hodge&#x27;s report on the Garden Bridge, and claimed that she broke Parliamentary rules during her research. In December 2017, the Parliamentary Standards Committee found that Hodge had breached the MPs&#x27; code of conduct. The code states MPs should use public resources only &quot;in support of parliamentary duties&quot;. The committee ruled that, because the review had been commissioned by an outside body, it had not been carried out as part of Hodge&#x27;s parliamentary activities. The committee recommended that Hodge apologise to the House of Commons for the breach on a point of order. Hodge subsequently apologised and said &quot;I carried out this inquiry in good faith and in the public interest. &quot;I think all MPs would benefit from greater clarity in the rules governing the use of offices.&quot; Hodge later repaid ¬£2.97, which represented the cost of House of Commons stationery, after the committee&#x27;s report found that she should not have used Parliamentary resources for her review. In response to the findings of the Parliamentary Standards Committee&#x27;s investigation, Andrew Boff said the committee&#x27;s findings left &quot;a sour taste&quot;, and claimed that he found it &#x27;hard to believe [Hodge] was unaware of the rules.&quot;

===Views===
At a keynote speech to the Institute for Public Policy Research on 26 November 2004, Hodge defended the concept of greater state regulation of individuals&#x27; choices, asserting only that &quot;some may call it the nanny state but I call it a force for good&quot;.

Hodge identifies as a Zionist. On 17 November 2006, it was reported by the &quot;Islington Tribune&quot; that Hodge described the Iraq War as a &quot;big mistake in foreign affairs&quot;. This report, relayed by BBC News, appeared to cast doubt on Hodge&#x27;s confidence in Tony Blair&#x27;s foreign policy since 1998. A Downing Street spokesperson responded by pointing out that &quot;Margaret Hodge voted for military action in Iraq. Since then, she has always spoken in favour of it.&quot;

In the 2015 Labour Party leadership election, she nominated Liz Kendall.

In June 2016, together with Ann Coffey, Hodge called for a motion of no confidence in party leader Jeremy Corbyn. The following month, she supported Owen Smith in the 2016 Labour leadership election.

====Views on antisemitism in Labour====
In July 2018, the National Executive Committee (NEC) adopted a code of conduct on antisemitism which was based on the IHRA&#x27;s working definition while omitting or modifying examples of antisemitism, including defining how criticism of Israel can be antisemitic. Hodge subsequently said that Labour&#x27;s refusal to adopt the full set of unamended examples for disciplinary purposes &quot;make the party a hostile environment for Jews. It chose to entrench antisemitism ... This means that in 2018 a party member can call a Jew a Nazi and face little consequence.&quot; In contrast, a coalition of 36 international Jewish anti-Zionist groups signed a letter of opposition to the IHRA definition, calling it a &quot;distorted definition of antisemitism to stifle criticism of Israel&quot;. Labour said all the examples were covered by other parts of the code. After the adoption of the new code, Hodge confronted Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in parliament and called him &quot;a fucking antisemite and a racist&quot;. The Party initiated a disciplinary investigation of the incident, with a spokesperson saying that &quot;The rules of the Parliamentary Labour Party are quite clear, that colleagues have to treat each other with respect and not bring the party into disrepute and that is why action will be taken.&quot; The investigation was terminated following fears that MPs would resign had it continued. A Labour spokesperson said that Hodge &quot;expressed regret&quot; for her remarks: however, Hodge said that there were &quot;no apologies, on either side&quot;. Hodge said that the prospect of an investigation had made her think about &quot;what it felt like to be a Jew in Germany in the 30s&quot;.

In March 2019, Hodge made a secret recording of a meeting she had with Corbyn. The recording was later passed to The &quot;Sunday Times&quot; which published extracts. In the recording, Corbyn said that some evidence of complaints was being mislaid, ignored or not used, which was why he had asked Lord Falconer to review the process. Corbyn later wrote to Hodge to convey his disappointment at what he considered &quot;to be a total breach of trust and privacy&quot;. In the same month, she proposed that the party close down constituencies that passed motions critical of individual investigations or of the IHRA&#x27;s Working Definition.

In June 2019, Hodge condemned the reinstatement to Labour of Chris Williamson, who had been investigated for comments he had made on antisemitism in the Labour Party.

In July 2019, Hodge called for a new and entirely independent system to handle antisemitism disciplinary proceedings in the Labour party as, she said, political interference has corrupted the current system. The party rejected her claim as unfounded. She also stated that matters had only become worse since she confronted Corbyn a year before.

In September 2019, Hodge said &quot;I&#x27;m not going to give up until Jeremy Corbyn ceases to be leader of the Labour Party.&quot;

In July 2018, she accepted an invitation to become an honorary patron of the Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAA). In the run-up to the 2019 general election, CAA asked her to resign because she was standing as a Labour Party candidate; she did so but described their decision as &quot;both astonishing and wounding&quot;, showing a lack of respect and impugning her integrity.

====Antisemitism investigation====

In July 2019, Hodge shared with the media a clandestine photo of Corbyn meeting Charedi activist Shraga Stern. Hodge tweeted that &quot;Having lunch &amp; wondering why Corbyn wants to be seen talking to an anti-LGBT activist who doesn&#x27;t represent the mainstream Jewish community yet chooses to sideline groups like Jewish Labour.&quot; Stern subsequently lodged a formal complaint with the Labour Party that Hodge&#x27;s tweet was an &quot;antisemitic attack&quot; and sidelined him as a &quot;second-class Jew&quot;.

===Other events===
In 2004, Fathers 4 Justice campaigner Jonathan Stanesby handcuffed Hodge, stating he was arresting her for child abuse. Fathers 4 Justice targeted Hodge perceiving her as the &quot;bogeywoman of family law, who doesn&#x27;t even believe in equal parenting&quot;. Stanesby and collaborator Jason Hatch were acquitted of the charge of false imprisonment which they successfully defended as a reasonable form of political protest.

In June 2019, the TSSA conference passed a motion criticising Hodge for &quot;endorsing tactical voting, including voting for candidates other than Labour&quot; in the 2019 European Parliament election, pointing out that this was a breach of party rules and should result in automatic removal of membership.

On 28 September 2019, Barking Labour members voted in a &#x27;trigger ballot&#x27; to hold a full selection process to choose their parliamentary candidate for the next general election, rather than automatically reselecting Hodge. She said she wished to stand and was automatically included in an all woman shortlist. According to one local member, factors in the decision to hold a selection process included her age, the desire to have an MP who lives in the area and support for the principles of accountability and local democracy. On Monday 28 October 2019, Hodge was reselected.

==House of Lords==
Hodge announced in 2021 that she would not seek re-election as MP for Barking and shortly after the 2024 United Kingdom general election, she was nominated for a life peerage in the 2024 Dissolution Honours. She was created &quot;Baroness Hodge of Barking, of Great Massingham in the County of Norfolk&quot;, on 14 August 2024. She was introduced to the House of Lords on 4 September 2024.

==Non-political roles==
Since November 2018, Hodge has been Chair of Council at Royal Holloway, University of London, following the Privy Council consenting to the position being remunerated. Hitherto, this role had always been a voluntary position.

==Personal life==
Hodge married Andrew Watson in 1968; the couple had one son and a daughter, Lizzi Watson, a BBC journalist. They divorced in 1978 and in the same year she married Henry Hodge (later Sir Henry), by whom she had two more daughters. He was a solicitor who was appointed as a High Court Judge in 2004. He died in 2009.

Hodge describes herself as a secular Jew, but that her religious background is &quot;what defines me&quot;.

==Use of offshore tax haven==

In 2015 there was considerable controversy about her benefiting, to the tune of ¬£1.5 million, from assets repatriated from a Liechtenstein family trust in 2011 using the Liechtenstein disclosure facility, that reduced penalties and removed the risk of prosecution for Britons moving undeclared assets back to the UK. Coverage focused on the apparent hypocrisy in her condemnation of the use of tax havens. &quot;The Times&quot; reported that 75% of the shares in the family trust had previously been held in Panama, which Hodge had previously criticised for its financial secrecy and use as a tax haven. Hodge issued a statement that she had always fully declared the shareholding, never had a management role in the company, and had received assurances that the company always paid the appropriate tax.

==Honours==
Hodge was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1978 Birthday Honours while a member of Islington Council. She was promoted to Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2015 Dissolution Honours for political service.

Hodge was made a freeman of the City of London in 2013.

<text>James Donnelly Touhig, Baron Touhig (born 5 December 1947), known as Don Touhig, is a British politician and life peer who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Islwyn from 1995 to 2010. A member of the Labour and Co-operative parties, he served in government as an Assistant Whip from 1999 to 2001 and a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State from 2001 to 2006.

==Early life==
He went to St Francis RC School in Abersychan near Pontypool, then the Mid Gwent College (now Coleg Gwent) in Pontypool. Before entering parliament, he had been a journalist from 1968 to 1976. From 1976 to 1990, he was the Editor of the Free Press of Monmouthshire (Monmouth Free Press). From 1988 to 1992, he was the general manager and Editor-in-Chief of the Free Press Group of newspapers. He was the general manager (business development) of the Bailey Group from 1992 to 1993, then of Bailey Print from 1993 to 1995. He served on Gwent County Council from 1973 to 1995. He joined the TGWU in 1962 and the Labour Party in 1966.

==Parliamentary career==

===House of Commons===
Touhig contested the Richmond and Barnes constituency at the 1992 general election, but reached third-place behind the Conservative and Liberal Democrat candidates. Following the resignation of Neil Kinnock, former Leader of the Opposition and Leader of the Labour Party, he was elected to succeed him as MP for Islwyn at the by-election on 16 February 1995. 

From 1996 to 1997, Touhig was a Member of the Welsh Affairs Select Committee. He served as Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to Gordon Brown, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, from May 1997 to July 1999. He had to resign as PPS in 1999, when he confessed to receiving a leaked Social Security Select Committee report on Child benefit. He was later suspended for three days from the Commons.

He was appointed to serve as an Assistant Whip from November 1999 to June 2001. He was a junior minister at the Ministry of Defence, with special responsibility for veterans, but left government in the May 2006 reshuffle. He was made a Member of the Privy Council on 19 July 2006.

In Paul Flynn&#x27;s 1999 book &quot;Dragons and Poodles&quot;, he was described as being the &quot;seamstress-in-chief of stitch ups&quot;, that he could be &quot;ambitious&quot; and &quot;can be pompous&quot;.

On 29 January 2010, Touhig announced that he would stand down at the 2010 General Election.

===House of Lords===
On 28 June 2010, Touhig was made a life peer in the House of Lords as Baron Touhig, of Islwyn and Glansychan in the County of Gwent. 

He was appointed to the opposition front bench as a Whip and Shadow Spokesperson for Defence in September 2015, serving as a Whip until September 2016 and a Defence Spokesperson until October 2017. He returned to the defence brief from April 2020 to May 2021.

==Personal life==
Touhig was married on 21 September 1968 to Jennifer Hughes. She died in 2014 from cancer, aged 67. They have two sons and two daughters.

==Honours==
He is a papal knight of the Order of Saint Sylvester (KSS).

<doc id="417492" wikidata="Q335507" url="?curid=417492" title="David Puttnam">
<text>David Terence Puttnam, Baron Puttnam, CBE, HonFRSA, HonFRPS, MRIA (; born 25 February 1941), is a British-Irish film producer, educator, environmentalist and former member of the House of Lords. His productions include &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture, &quot;The Mission&quot;, &quot;The Killing Fields&quot;, &quot;Local Hero&quot;, &quot;Midnight Express&quot; and &quot;Memphis Belle&quot;. In 1982, he received the BAFTA for Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema, and in 2006 he was awarded the BAFTA Fellowship for lifetime achievement from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.

Between 1997 and 2021, Lord Puttnam sat on the Labour benches in the House of Lords. In 2019 he was appointed chair to the select committee on democracy and digital technologies. The committee published its findings in its &quot;Digital Technology &amp; the Resurrection of Trust&quot; report in June 2020.

==Early life==
David Terence Puttnam was born in Southgate, London, England, the son of Marie Beatrix, a housewife of Jewish origin, and Leonard Arthur Puttnam, a photographer. Educated at Minchenden Grammar School in London, Puttnam had an early career in advertising, including five formative years at Collett Dickenson Pearce, and as agent acting for the photographers David Bailey and Brian Duffy.

==Film career==
===Sandy Lieberson===
Puttnam turned to film production in the late 1960s, working with Sanford Lieberson&#x27;s production company Goodtimes Enterprises. The first feature he produced was &quot;Melody&quot; (1971), based on a script by Alan Parker and which was a minor hit.

Puttnam and Lieberson produced the documentaries &quot;Peacemaking 1919&quot; (1971), &quot;Glastonbury Fayre&quot; (1972), and &quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot; (1972). Their second film, &quot;The Pied Piper&quot; (1972), directed by Jacques Demy was not a success, but &quot;That&#x27;ll Be the Day&quot; (1973) with David Essex proved a hit.

Puttnam and Lieberson went on to produce &quot;The Final Programme&quot; (1973), a science fiction film, and made some more documentaries, these being &quot;Double Headed Eagle: Hitler&#x27;s Rise to Power 1918‚Äì1933&quot; (1973) and &quot;Swastika&quot; (1974).

Puttnam and Lieberson executive-produced the Ken Russell biopic &quot;Mahler&quot; (1974), and did a sequel to &quot;That&#x27;ll Be The Day&quot;, entitled &quot;Stardust&quot; (1974) and directed by Michael Apted.

There were more documentaries: &quot;Radio Wonderful&quot; (1974), &quot;Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?&quot; (1975), &quot;James Dean: The First American Teenager&quot; (1975) and &quot;The Memory of Justice&quot; (1976).

A second film with Russell, &quot;Lisztomania&quot; (1975), was a box office disaster and led to the end of the Puttnam‚ÄìLieberson partnership.

Puttnam had a box office success with &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot; (1976), a musical he executive-produced, written and directed by Alan Parker, and produced by Alan Marshall. It was the last film Puttnam would make under the &#x27;Goodtimes&#x27; banner. He went on to set up a new company, Enigma Films.

===Enigma Films===
Puttnam produced &quot;The Duellists&quot; (1977), the directorial debut of Ridley Scott; and with Marshall once more, he produced &quot;Midnight Express&quot; (1978), directed by Parker from a script by Oliver Stone, and which was a notable box office success.

Puttnam made his first film in America, &quot;Foxes&quot; (1980), itself the directorial debut of Adrian Lyne. It was a box office flop.

Puttnam&#x27;s next film was his most successful yet. &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; (1981), the first feature directed by Hugh Hudson, became a massive hit and won the Academy Award for Best Picture. It was produced in association with Goldcrest Pictures.

Puttnam set up a television company, Enigma TV, and made a series of television films in association with Goldcrest, which carried Puttnam&#x27;s name as executive producer. Six were made as a series called &quot;First Love&quot; for the fledgling Channel Four: &quot;P&#x27;tang, Yang, Kipperbang&quot; (1982), directed by Apted; &quot;Experience Preferred... But Not Essential&quot; (1982); &quot;Secrets&quot; (1983); &quot;Those Glory Glory Days&quot; (1983); &quot;Sharma and Beyond&quot; (1983); and &quot;Arthur&#x27;s Hallowed Ground&quot; (1984). Other films produced for television were &quot;Forever Young&quot; (1983); &quot;Red Monarch&quot; (1983); and &quot;Winter Flight&quot; (1984).

Puttnam continued to produce feature films. He had another success with &quot;Local Hero&quot; (1983), written and directed by Bill Forsyth; and also produced the acclaimed &quot;Cal&quot; (1984) directed by Pat O&#x27;Connor, and &quot;The Killing Fields&quot; (1984), directed by Roland Joffe.

Puttnam continued to executive produce television movies such as &quot;The Frog Prince&quot; (1985), &quot;Mr. Love&quot; (1985), &quot;Defence of the Realm&quot; (1986), and &quot;Knights &amp; Emeralds&quot; (1986). He also produced &quot;The Mission&quot; (1986), directed by Joffe from a script by Robert Bolt, which won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 1986.

===Columbia Pictures===
Puttnam was chairman and CEO of Columbia Pictures from June 1986 until September 1987. There he oversaw a development of the $270-million film package that had a number of 15‚Äì18 films for the first two years, and a number of 15 films for the next two years, and handled in such acquisitions, like &quot;The Big Easy&quot;, from Kings Road Productions, and Spike Lee&#x27;s low budget feature &quot;School Daze&quot;, and made a decision to drop big-budget films in favor of smaller features, a move that did not sit well with Coca-Cola and Hollywood, and decided to let deals with existing contracts expire.

===Post-Columbia producing work===
Puttnam returned to producing individual films with &quot;Memphis Belle&quot; (1990), &quot;Meeting Venus&quot; (1991), &quot;A Dangerous Man: Lawrence After Arabia&quot; (1992), &quot;Being Human&quot; (1994), &quot;War of the Buttons&quot; (1994), &quot;The Confessional&quot; (1994), and &quot;My Life So Far&quot; (1995). He also executive-produced &quot;The Josephine Baker Story&quot; (1991), &quot;Without Warning: The James Brady Story&quot; (1992), and &quot;The Burning Season&quot; (1994).

Puttnam returned to the field of film production in 2015 to oversee pre-production of &quot;Don‚Äôt Trust, Don‚Äôt Fear, Don‚Äôt Beg&quot;, Ben Stewart&#x27;s account of the Arctic 30 incident. He stepped away from the role in 2019 when he was appointed to chair the House of Lords Special Committee ‚ÄòDemocracy and Digital Technology‚Äô.
Puttnam is the President of the Film Distributors‚Äô Association; Chair of the TSL Advisory Board;
Chair of Nord Anglia International School, Dublin; Life President, National Film &amp; Television
School, a UNICEF Ambassador, and Adjunct Professor of Film Studies and Digital
Humanities at University College Cork.

==Politics==
In 1997, Puttnam entered the House of Lords as a life peer and was granted Letters Patent to become Baron Puttnam, of Queensgate in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. In 1998, he was named in a list of the biggest private financial donors to the Labour Party. In 2002, he chaired the joint scrutiny committee on the Communications Bill, which recommended an amendment to prevent ownership of British terrestrial television stations by companies with a significant share of the newspaper market. This was widely interpreted as being aimed at stopping Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation from buying Channel Five. When the government opposed the amendment, Puttnam brokered a compromise ‚Äì the introduction of a &#x27;public interest&#x27; test, to be applied by the new regulator Ofcom but without explicit restrictions.

From 2004 to 2005, Puttnam chaired the Hansard Society Commission on Communication of Parliamentary Democracy, the final report of which urged all political parties to commit to a renewal of parliamentary life in an attempt to reinvigorate representative democracy. In 2007, he chaired the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Draft Climate Change Bill.

From 2012 to 2017, Puttnam was the Prime Ministerial Trade Envoy to Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar (Burma). During the same period, Puttnam ‚Äì who lives in Skibbereen, County Cork ‚Äì was named Ireland&#x27;s Digital Champion by Communications Minister Pat Rabbitte, TD.

In August 2014, Puttnam was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

In June 2019, Puttnam chaired the special House of Lords Democracy and Digital Technologies Committee, set up to investigate the impact of digital technologies on democracy and oversaw the publication of its findings in June 2020. The report, &quot;Digital Technology &amp; the Resurrection of Trust&quot;, made 45 recommendations to government to address the spread of misinformation and disinformation and the consequential erosion of public trust. And that the media has a duty to &quot;balance freedom of expression with wider moral and social responsibilities.&quot;

Puttnam announced his retirement from the House of Lords in October 2021, as he delivered the Shirley Williams Lecture, detailing his reasons for leaving in his speech.

== Atticus Education ==
Puttnam founded Atticus Education in 2012. Atticus delivers interactive seminars on film and a variety of other subjects to educational institutions around the world.

==Association with education==
For 10 years, Puttnam was chairman of the National Film and Television School whose alumni included people such as Nick Park; and in 2017, he succeeded Richard Attenborough as Life President. Puttnam founded Skillset, which trains young people to become members of the film and television industries. From 2002 to 2009, he was UK president of UNICEF and remains an ambassador.

Puttnam was the first Chancellor of the University of Sunderland from 1997 until 13 July 2007. He was appointed an Honorary Doctor of Education during the School of Education and Lifelong Learning&#x27;s Academic Awards Ceremonies and upon his retirement, he was granted the Freedom of the City of Sunderland. In 1998, he founded the National Teaching Awards and became its first chairman. He was the founding chairman of the General Teaching Council from 2000 to 2002, was appointed as Chancellor of the Open University from 2006 to 2017, and was also the Chairman of NESTA (The National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts) from 1998 until 2003. He was also on the board of directors of learning technologies company Promethean.

Puttnam is the patron of Schools North East, an organisation set up in 2007 to represent all schools in the North East of England. He is also a patron of the Shakespeare Schools Festival (now Shakespeare Schools Foundation), a charity that enables school children across the UK to perform Shakespeare in professional theatres.

In 2012 he founded Atticus Education delivering interactive seminars on film, media and screen to students at universities all over the world.

From May 2014 until 2018, Puttnam was Chair of the Academic Board for Pearson College, part of Pearson PLC, the first FTSE 100 company to offer degrees in the UK. In March 2015, Puttnam was made a freeman at the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead, in recognition of his service as chairman at the Sage Gateshead.

Puttnam was a member of the Commonwealth of Learning&#x27;s Board of Governors until January 2020 and stood down as Chair of Film London Executive Task Force in 2022. As well as being Chair of Atticus Education, today he holds a number of positions including President of the Film Distributors‚Äô Association, Chair of the NAE Education Advisory Board, leading on the Groups Digital Transformation, Life President of the National Film &amp; Television School, UNICEF Ambassador, Member of the Advisory Board of Accenture (Ireland), Adjunct Professor of Film Studies and Digital Humanities at University College Cork, Adjunct Professor of the School of Media &amp; Communications at RMIT University (Australia), Patron of the Dublin Bid World Summit on Media for Children 2020/2023 and International Ambassador, WWF.¬† He is a member of the ASA (Advertising Standards Authority) Parliamentary Network.

==Awards==
In 1982, Puttnam received the BAFTA Michael Balcon Award for his outstanding contribution to the British Film Industry.

In 1983, Puttnam was appointed CBE. In 1995, he was appointed as a Knight Bachelor.

In February 2006, Puttnam was awarded the BAFTA Fellowship. He made the occasion notable by delivering a particularly moving homage to his late father, who had died before he could see his son receive the Best Picture Oscar for &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;. He also congratulated contemporary filmmakers for making films with integrity: the lack of such films being produced had been the reason for his retirement from the film industry in the late 1990s.

Puttnam is the recipient of over 50 honorary degrees and fellowships from the UK and overseas: he received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 2001, and from Trinity College Dublin in 2016; he was awarded the Royal Photographic Society&#x27;s President&#x27;s Medal and Honorary Fellowship (HonFRPS) in recognition of a sustained, significant contribution to the art of photography in 2003; and, in May 2006, he was made an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts.

On 12 July 2007, Puttnam was given the freedom of the City of Sunderland. In 2008, he received an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Science from Nottingham Trent University in recognition of his extraordinary contribution to the cultural landscape of the UK, in both economic and creative terms, and for his notable support for the Nottingham City-based GameCity Festival. He was elected to the Royal Irish Academy in 2017.

Puttnam suffers from ME, debilitating him on occasions.

In 2009, in partnership with Sir Michael Barber, Puttnam released &quot;We Are the People We&#x27;ve Been Waiting For&quot;, an education documentary featuring high-profile figures discussing their own experiences of education.

All in all, Puttnam&#x27;s films have won 10 Oscars, 31 BAFTAs, 13 Golden Globes, nine Emmys, four David di Donatellos in Italy and the Palme d&#x27;Or at Cannes.

==Other interests==

Puttnam was deputy Chairman of Channel 4 Television from 2006 to 2012. He is president of the Film Distributors&#x27; Association (FDA) and chair of the TSL Advisory Board.

Puttnam co-authored (with Neil Watson) &quot;Movies and Money&quot;, published in January 2000 by Vintage Books.

When Puttnam became the chairman of Profero, a London-based digital marketing agency in April 2007, he explained the move saying: &quot;My experience over the past forty-odd (some very odd) years has encompassed marketing, entertainment and social issues, a fascinating mix that is integral to the daily lives of consumers and citizens. A business that can combine and magnify these dynamics can only create incredible value for their clients and, as a by-product, themselves. To me Profero is in just such a position, and it&#x27;s now my job to help them realise their potential.&quot;

Puttnam, who had produced Ian Charleson&#x27;s star-making film &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;, contributed a chapter to the 1990 book, &quot;For Ian Charleson: A Tribute&quot;.

On 19 August 2007, Puttnam gave the oration at the annual Michael Collins commemoration in B√©al na Bl√°th, County Cork.

<text>Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet (3 September 1899 ‚Äì 31 August 1985), usually known as Macfarlane or Mac Burnet, was an Australian virologist known for his contributions to immunology. He won a Nobel Prize in 1960 for predicting acquired immune tolerance. He also developed the theory of clonal selection.

Burnet received his Doctor of Medicine degree from the University of Melbourne in 1924, and his PhD from the University of London in 1928. He went on to conduct pioneering research in microbiology and immunology at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, and served as director of the Institute from 1944 to 1965. From 1965 until his retirement in 1978, Burnet worked at the University of Melbourne. Throughout his career he played an active role in the development of public policy for the medical sciences in Australia and was a founding member of the Australian Academy of Science (AAS), and served as its president from 1965 to 1969.

Burnet&#x27;s major achievements in microbiology included discovering the causative agents of Q-fever and psittacosis; developing assays for the isolation, culture and detection of influenza virus; describing the recombination of influenza strains; demonstrating that the myxomatosis virus does not cause disease in humans. Modern methods for producing influenza vaccines are still based on Burnet&#x27;s work improving virus growing processes in hen&#x27;s eggs.

For his contributions to Australian science, Burnet was made the first Australian of the Year in 1960, and in 1978 a Knight of the Order of Australia. He was recognised internationally for his achievements: in addition to the Nobel, he received the Lasker Award and the Royal and Copley Medal from the Royal Society, honorary doctorates, and distinguished service honours from the Commonwealth of Nations and Japan.

==Early life==
Burnet was born in Traralgon, Victoria; his father, Frank Burnet, a Scottish emigrant to Australia, was the manager of the Traralgon branch of the Colonial Bank. His mother Hadassah Burnet (n√©e Mackay) was the daughter of a middle-class Scottish immigrant, and met his father when Frank was working in the town of Koroit. Frank was 36, and 14 years older than Hadassah. The family was socially conservative Anglo-Saxon Protestant. Frank Macfarlane Burnet was the second of seven children and from childhood was known as &quot;Mac&quot;. He had an older sister, two younger sisters and three younger brothers. The eldest daughter Doris had a mental disability that consumed most of Hadassah&#x27;s time and the family saw Doris&#x27;s condition as an unspoken stigma, discouraging the other children from inviting friends home, lest they come across the eldest daughter. From his early years in Traralgon, Mac enjoyed exploring the environment around him, particularly Traralgon Creek. He first attended a private school run by a single teacher before starting at the government primary school at the age of 7. Mac was distant from his father‚Äîwho liked to spend his free time fishing and playing golf‚Äîfrom a young age. He preferred bookish pursuits from a young age and was not enamoured of sport, and by the age of eight was old enough to analyse his father&#x27;s character; Mac disapproved of Frank and saw him as a hypocrite who espoused moral principles and put on a facade of uprightedness, while associating with businessmen of dubious ethics. Hadassah was preoccupied with Doris, so Mac developed a rather solitary personality.

The Burnets moved to Terang in 1909, when Frank was posted to be the bank manager there, having declined a post in London. Burnet was interested in the wildlife around the nearby Lake Terang; he joined the Scouts in 1910 and enjoyed all outdoor activities. While living in Terang, he began to collect beetles and study biology. He read biology articles in the &quot;Chambers&#x27;s Encyclopaedia&quot;, which introduced him to the work of Charles Darwin. During his early teens, the family took annual holidays to Port Fairy, where Burnet spent his time observing and recording the behaviour of the wildlife. He was educated at Terang State School and attended Sunday school at the local church, where the priest encouraged him to pursue scholastic studies and awarded him a book on ants as a reward for his academic performance. He advised Frank to invest in Mac&#x27;s education and he won a full scholarship to board and study at Geelong College, one of Victoria&#x27;s most exclusive private schools. Starting there in 1913, Burnet was the only boarder with a full scholarship. He did not enjoy his time there among the scions of the ruling upper class; while most of his peers were brash and sports-oriented, Burnet was bookish and not athletically inclined, and found his fellow students to be arrogant and boorish. During this period he kept his beetle-collecting and disapproval of his peers a secret and mixed with his schoolmates out of necessity. Nevertheless, his academic prowess gained him privileges, and he graduated in 1916, placing first in his school overall, and in history, English, chemistry and physics. The typical university path for a person of his social background was to pursue studies in theology, law or medicine. By this time, he was becoming disillusioned with religion and chose medicine. Due to World War I, military service was a possibility and he felt that a medical background would increase his chances of being given a non-combat post.

==Academic foundations==
From 1918, Burnet attended the University of Melbourne, where he lived in Ormond College on a residential scholarship. There, he read more of Darwin&#x27;s work and was influenced by the ideas of science and society in the writings of H. G. Wells. He enjoyed his time at university and spent much of his free time reading biology books in the library to feed his passion for scientific knowledge. He also had fleeting sporting success, holding down a position in Ormond&#x27;s First VIII rowing squad for a brief period. He continued to pursue his study of beetles in private, although his classmates found out and there was no loss in this as they viewed his hobby positively. Despite an ongoing shyness, Burnet got on well with staff and students at university. Burnet was self-motivated and often skipped lectures to study at his own faster pace and pursue further knowledge in the library, and he came equal first in physics and chemistry in first year. The following year, 1918, he became increasingly immersed in laboratory work, but he was also dogged by peer pressure to enlist in the military, which he saw as a distasteful prospect. However, this was averted by the end of the war. In 1919, he was one of 12 high-performing students selected for extra tuition, and he came equal first in third year physiology. He began clinical work in the same year, but found it somewhat unpleasant as he was interested in diagnosing the patient and had little interest in showing empathy towards them.

While at university, he became an agnostic and later an aggressive atheist; he was sceptical of religious faith, which he regarded as &quot;an effort to believe what common sense tells you isn&#x27;t true.&quot; He was also disgusted by what he regarded as hypocritical conduct by religious adherents. Towards the later years of his undergraduate years, his unhappiness with religion began to dog him to a greater extent. He tried to become involved with communism for a brief period but then resolved to devote himself to scientific research. The length of time required to study medicine had been reduced to five years to train doctors faster following the outbreak of World War I, and Burnet graduated with a Bachelor of Medicine and a Bachelor of Surgery in 1922, ranking second in the final exams despite the death of his father a few weeks earlier. His fellow graduates included Ian Wark, Kate Campbell, Jean Macnamara, Rupert Willis and Roy Cameron, who became distinguished scientists in their own right.

He then did a ten-month residency at Melbourne Hospital to gain experience before going into practice. The new graduates spent four months in the medicine ward, another four in surgery, and the remaining two in casualty. In the surgery ward he worked under John Gordon and Alan Newton, both well known surgeons. He enjoyed this period immensely and was disappointed when he had to do his medicine residency. However, he was soon engrossed in his work, having been inspired by the neurologist Richard Stawell, whom Burnet came to idolise. As a result of this he became intent on a career in clinical neurology, and he wrote a theoretical paper about testing sensory losses following peripheral nerve lesions, but his submission to the &quot;Clinical Report of the Melbourne Hospital&quot; was rejected. Burnet applied to be medical registrar as part of his clinical career path, but the medical superintendent of Melbourne Hospital, who was in charge of such appointments, deemed Burnet&#x27;s character and personality more suited to a laboratory research career, and asked Burnet to withdraw his application in return for the post of senior resident pathologist, which would become vacant in the following months. Burnet complied.

During the transition period he worked as a pathology registrar at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and also prepared for his Doctor of Medicine examinations, late in 1923. In 1923 he took up the post of senior resident pathologist at the Melbourne Hospital; the laboratories were a part of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. He conducted research into the agglutinin reactions in typhoid fever, leading to his first scientific publications. He decided to work full-time on the antibody response in typhoid, even though he was technically supposed to pursuing pathology as part of his obligations to the hospital. Burnet came first in the Doctor of Medicine exams by a long distance, and his score was excluded from the scaling process so that the other students would not fail for being so far behind.

At the time, the Hall Institute was in the early stages of rapid expansion. The new director of the Institute, Charles Kellaway, wanted to increase the activities of the organisation to not only support hospital operations but have separate research groups in physiology, microbiology and biochemistry that would also do independent studies. He also hoped to raise the standards to make the Institute comparable to the world-class operations in Europe and America. Kellaway took a liking to Burnet and saw him as the best young talent in the Institute with the ability to help raise it to world leading standards. However, he thought that Burnet would need experience working in a laboratory in England before he could lead his own research group on bacteriology in Australia. Burnet left Australia for England in 1925 and served as ship&#x27;s surgeon during his journey in exchange for a free fare. On arrival, he took a paid position assisting the curator of the National Collection of Type Cultures at the Lister Institute in London. Burnet prepared or maintained bacteria cultures for other researchers in the morning and was free to do his own experiments in the afternoon. During the latter half of 1926, he experimented to see if Salmonella typhimurium was affected by bacteriophage.

He was awarded the Beit Memorial Fellowship by the Lister Institute in 1926; this gave him enough money for him to resign his curator position and he began full-time research on bacteriophages. He injected mice with bacteriophage and observed their immunological reactions and believed bacteriophages to be viruses. For this work he received a Ph.D. from the University of London in 1928 under the direction of Professor J. C. G. Ledingham and was invited to write a chapter on bacteriophages for the Medical Research Council&#x27;s &quot;System of Bacteriology&quot;. He was also given an invitation to deliver a paper at the Royal Society of Medicine in 1927 on the link between O-agglutinins and bacteriophage. Burnet began attending the Fabian Society functions and befriended some communists, although he refrained from joining them in overt left-wing activism. He also spent his free time enjoying theatre, engaging in amateur archaeology and cycling through continental Europe.

While in London, Burnet became engaged to fellow Australian Edith Linda Marston Druce. She was a secondary school teacher and daughter of a barrister&#x27;s clerk and the pair had met in 1923 and had a few dates but did not keep in touch. Druce sought out Burnet while on a holiday in London and they quickly agreed to marriage although she had to return to Australia. They married in 1928 after he had completed his Ph.D. and returned to Australia, and had a son and two daughters. At the time, there was a vacancy for the Chair of Bacteriology at the University of London, and Ledingham was lobbying his colleagues to offer Burnet the post, but Burnet returned to Australia, partly because of Druce.

==Walter and Eliza Hall Institute==

===Virology and medicine===
When Burnet returned to Australia, he went back to the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, where he was appointed assistant director by Kellaway. His first assignment was to investigate the Bundaberg tragedy, in which 12 children had died after receiving a contaminated diphtheria vaccine. Kellaway was put in charge of a royal commission to investigate the matter and he put Burnet in charge of the laboratory investigations. He identified &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; in the toxin-antitoxin mixture that had been administered to the children; it had been picked up from the skin of one of the children and then transmitted to the others in the injections. However, it turned out to be another toxin that had caused the children&#x27;s deaths; this work on staphylococcal toxin piqued his interest in immunology. During this time, he continued to study bacteriophages, writing 32 papers on phages between 1924 and 1937. In 1929, Burnet and his graduate assistant Margot McKie wrote a paper suggesting that bacteriophages could exist as a stable non-infectious form that multiplies with the bacterial host. Their pioneering description of lysogeny was not accepted until much later, and was crucial to the work of Max Delbr√ºck, Alfred Hershey and Salvador Luria on the replication mechanism and genetics of viruses, for which they were awarded the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.
Between 1932 and 1933, Burnet took leave of absence to undertake a fellowship at the National Institute for Medical Research in London. The Great Depression had resulted in Burnet&#x27;s salary being cut from 1000 to 750 pounds, and the National Institute had been given a large grant from the Rockefeller Foundation that allowed them to hire Burnet at 1000 pounds per annum. The National Institute&#x27;s Director Sir Henry Dale gained permission from Kellaway for the two-year move; Kellaway promised to hold Burnet&#x27;s job for him when he returned and felt that the experience would make Burnet‚Äîwhom he saw as the Hall Institute&#x27;s brightest young scientist‚Äîbetter equipped to expand operations when he returned to Melbourne. Dale also paid for Burnet&#x27;s sister to travel to England to help look after her brother&#x27;s young children.

Significant breakthroughs in virology were made while he was there, including the isolation and first demonstration of the transmission of the influenza virus. His own research was on the canarypox virus, which he used in developing a chick embryo assay for the isolation and quantification of animal viruses. Dale offered Burnet a permanent position but he declined and returned to the Hall Institute. Following his productive work in London, the Rockefeller Institute agreed to fund a new virus research laboratory in Melbourne for Burnet. He brought back a set of viruses from the National Institute to begin the basis of research in Melbourne.

When Burnet returned to Australia, he continued his work on virology, including the epidemiology of herpes simplex. He was also involved in two projects that were not viral, the characterisation of the causative agents of psittacosis and Q fever. After finding that parrots and cockatoos were infected with psittacosis and were responsible for transmission, he lobbied the government for a ban in order to prevent human infection, but he was rebuffed and later came to agree with the government position that there was not much danger. During the time he worked on Q fever with Australian scientist E.H. Derrick, the causative organism of which was named &quot;Coxiella burnetii&quot; in Burnet&#x27;s honour, he became the first person to acquire the disease in the laboratory. His epidemiological studies of herpes and Q fever displayed an appreciation of the ecology of infectious disease that became a characteristic of his scientific method.

During World War II, Burnet&#x27;s research moved to influenza and scrub typhus. With the outbreak of war, Burnet was handed more responsibility and made acting director and had to oversee the move into a new building as Kellaway was seconded to the military in 1939. Due to Kellaway, many of the infectious disease problems afflicting the military were referred to the Institute. Fearing a repeat of the massive global influenza outbreak that occurred after World War I, Burnet focused the Institute in the search for a vaccine. He first tested the vaccine on a group of medical students, and after a promising test on 107 army volunteers in February 1942 following a rise in infections, a large-scale program was introduced two months later to inoculate all new recruits after an influenza A outbreak. In this trial, 20,000 personnel were vaccinated, without success, and the scheme was abandoned. In 1942, the investigations into scrub typhus accelerated after an exodus of researchers in that field from Malaya after the Japanese conquest of the area. However, this ended in tragedy when his collaborator Dora Lush accidentally injected herself and then died of the infection. Nevertheless, his work on immunisation had earned him international recognition by this time.

Burnet&#x27;s first book, &quot;Biological Aspects of Infectious Disease&quot;, was published in 1940. It had wide influence and was translated into several languages. In 1942 he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1944 he travelled to Harvard University to deliver the Dunham Lectures. There he was offered a chair, but he refused and returned to Australia. This was attributed to his nationalistic tendencies, as well as his sense of loyalty to the Hall Institute. During his trip he also visited the US military facility at Fort Bragg, where he discussed his work on influenza with the scientists working there.

In 1944, he was appointed director of the Institute when Kellaway was appointed director of the Wellcome Foundation. Although Kellaway had groomed Burnet to become a pivotal figure, he was hesitant as to whether Burnet would be at his most effective with a strategic leadership role. Kellaway thought that Burnet might not be suited to the post, and should have continued to focus purely on research for the time being. Burnet had similar doubts, particularly given his taciturn nature, but applied for the position anyway. Although he was not known for his social skills, his ability as a scientist and to impart ideas for investigation to his subordinates held his leadership and the Institute in good stead. Unlike his predecessor, who valued a broad gamut of research activities, Burnet was of the opinion that the Institute could not make a significant impact at global level in this way, and he pursued a policy of focusing all effort into one area at a time. Always a strong-willed and rather isolated man, he became more single-minded and less tolerant of criticism of his work and expected a more hierarchical structure and unquestioning obedience. According to biographer Sexton, he &quot;displayed a kind of territorial protectiveness in relation to his own work&quot;.

In 1944, it was decided by the University of Melbourne that Burnet would be appointed a professor as part of a cooperative program so that university students could be experimentally trained at the Institute, while the researchers engaged in some teaching. This was not a success, and there was much tension, as Burnet repeatedly expressed his opinion in public that university teaching and research should be kept separate, at one point leading to a series of open letters from university professors decrying his attitude. Burnet was also not interested in the politics of university funding, and his disengagement from administrative matters engendered resentment. On the other hand, Burnet was vigorous in obtaining funding for the Hall Institute from government bodies, resorting to the bluff of feigning interest in moving overseas to secure continued strong backing. However, he was criticised for being thrifty and refusing to invest in cutting edge equipment, despite the Hall Institute&#x27;s high standing in research circles. Colleagues believed that he was sceptical of modern technology and thought his outlook to be limiting.

In 1946, he initiated the Clinical Research Unit to allow for closer cooperation with the clinical activities of the now named Royal Melbourne Hospital. Despite his known derisive views of clinical science as being inferior, he supported the work enthusiastically.

Under Burnet&#x27;s direction, scientists at the Institute made significant contributions to infectious disease research during a period that has been called the &quot;golden age of virology&quot;. Virologists including Alick Isaacs, Gordon Ada, John Cairns, Stephen Fazekas de St. Groth, and Frank Fenner made significant contributions on Murray Valley encephalitis, myxomatosis, poliomyelitis, poxviruses, herpes and influenza.

Burnet made significant contributions to influenza research; he developed techniques to grow and study the virus, including hemagglutination assays. He worked on a live vaccine against influenza, but the vaccine was unsuccessful when tested during World War II. His interest in the influenza receptor led him to discover the neuraminidase that is secreted by &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot;, which later provided the foundation for Alfred Gottschalk&#x27;s significant work on glycoproteins and the neuraminidase substrate, sialic acid. Between 1951 and 1956, Burnet worked on the genetics of influenza. He examined the genetic control of virulence and demonstrated that the virus recombined at high frequency; this observation was not fully appreciated until several years later, when the segmented genome of influenza was demonstrated.

===Immunology===
In 1957, Burnet decided that research at the Institute should focus on immunology. Burnet reached the decision unilaterally, leaving many of the research staff disillusioned and feeling the action was arrogant; for Burnet&#x27;s part he was comfortable with the decision as he thought it to be effective. Many virologists left the Institute and settled the Australian National University&#x27;s John Curtin School of Medical Research. After 1957 all new staff and students at the Institute worked on immunological problems; Burnet was involved in work relating to autoimmune diseases and the graft-versus-host reaction, and increasingly in theoretical studies of immunology, immunological surveillance and cancer.

At the time, immunology was becoming more sophisticated, with the increasing role of molecular biology and biochemistry. Burnet was suspicious of the direction in which immunology was headed, and the increasing emphasis on technology and more intricate experiments, and colleagues felt that Burnet&#x27;s conservative attitude was a factor in his decision to turn the Institute&#x27;s focus to immunology.

Burnet began to switch his focus to immunology in the 1940s. In 1941 he wrote a monograph called &quot;The Production of Antibodies&quot;, which was revised and reissued in 1949 with Frank Fenner as a co-author. This book is seen as a key publication in immunology‚Äîit marks the move from the study of immunology as a chemical endeavour to a biological one. Importantly in this work, he introduced the concept of &quot;self&quot; and &quot;non-self&quot; to immunology. The distinction between self and non-self was an integral part of Burnet&#x27;s biological outlook, of his interest in the living organism in its totality, its activities, and interactions. Burnet regarded the &quot;self&quot; of the host body as being actively defined during its embryogenesis through complex interactions between immune cells and all the other cells and molecules within an embryo.

Using the concept of self, Burnet introduced a hypothesis about the situation where the body failed to make antibodies to its own components (autoimmunity) and by extension the idea of immune tolerance. He proposed that
if in embryonic life expendable cells from a genetically distinct race are implanted and established, no antibody response should develop against the foreign cell antigen when the animal takes on independent existence.
Burnet was, however, unable to prove this experimentally. Peter Medawar, Rupert E. Billingham and Leslie Brent did find support for Burnet&#x27;s hypothesis in 1953 when they showed that splenocytes could be engrafted by intravenous infusion into mice in utero or just after birth and that when these mice matured, they could accept skin and other tissues from the donor but not from any other mouse strain. Burnet and Medawar were co-recipients of the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this work, as it provided the experimental basis for inducing immune tolerance, thereby allowing the transplantation of solid organs. Burnet and Medawar were able to coordinate their work effectively despite their rather different personalities and physical separation; Burnet was taciturn whereas Medawar was a young and urbane Englishman, but they greatly respected one another.

However, later studies showed that cells or tissues transplanted before the immune system development of the recipient, such as in embryonic recipients, could be treated as foreign and trigger rejection, countering Burnet&#x27;s explanation for self tolerance. In contrast to the Burnet hypothesis of a special tolerance-inducing period defined by the age of the animal, Joshua Lederberg proposed in 1959, that it is the age of the lymphocyte that defines whether an antigen that is encountered will induce tolerance, with immature lymphocytes being tolerance-sensitive. Lederberg&#x27;s concept is now known as central tolerance, and is widely accepted. It may also explain the success of some transplants given early in life and the failure to induce tolerance in other studies. Burnet noted that his contributions to immune tolerance were strictly theoretical:
My part in the discovery of acquired immunological tolerance was a very minor one‚Äîit was the formulation of an hypothesis that called for experiment.

Burnet was interested in how the body produces antibodies in response to antigens. The dominant idea in the literature through the 1940s was that the antigen acted as a template for antibody production, which was known as the &quot;instructive&quot; hypothesis. Burnet was not satisfied with this explanation, and in the second edition of &quot;The Production of Antibodies&quot;, he and Fenner advanced an indirect template theory which proposed that each antigen could influence the genome, thus effecting the production of antibodies. In 1956 he became interested in Niels Kaj Jerne&#x27;s natural selection hypothesis, which described a mechanism for immune response based on an earlier theory of Nobel-winning immunologist Paul Ehrlich. Jerne proposed that the antigen bound to an antibody by chance and, that upon binding, more antibodies to that antigen would be produced. Burnet developed a model which he named clonal selection that expanded on and improved Jerne&#x27;s hypothesis. Burnet proposed that each lymphocyte bears on its surface specific immunoglobulins reflecting the specificity of the antibody that will later be synthesised once the cell is activated by an antigen. The antigen serves as a selective stimulus, causing preferential proliferation and differentiation of
the clones that have receptors for that antigen.

In 1958 Gustav Nossal and Lederberg showed that one B cell always produces only one antibody, which was the first evidence for clonal selection theory. Burnet wrote further about the theory in his 1959 book &quot;The Clonal Selection Theory of Acquired Immunity&quot;. His theory predicted almost all of the key features of the immune system as we understand it today, including autoimmune disease, immune tolerance and somatic hypermutation as a mechanism in antibody production. The clonal selection theory became one of the central concepts of immunology, and Burnet regarded his contributions to the theoretical understanding of the immune system as his greatest contribution to science, writing that he and Jerne should have received the Nobel for this work. Jerne was recognised for his contributions to the conceptualisation of the immune system when he was a co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in 1984.

There is some contention over Burnet&#x27;s publication of his version of the theory in the &quot;Australian Journal of Science&quot; in 1957. Some commentators argue he published in an Australian journal to fast-track his hypothesis and obtain priority for his theory over ideas that were published later that year in a paper written by David Talmage, which Burnet had read prior to its publication. In his paper Burnet cited Talmage&#x27;s review, and in a later interview, Talmage said he believed that Burnet &quot;truthfully had developed the idea before he received my paper&quot;. The theory is now sometimes known as Burnet&#x27;s clonal selection theory, which overlooks the contributions of Ehrlich, Jerne, Talmage, and the contributions of Lederberg, who conceptualised the genetics of clonal selection.

Burnet&#x27;s work on graft-versus-host was in collaboration with Lone Simonsen between 1960 and 1962. Simonsen had shown in 1957 that when a chick embryo was inoculated intravenously with adult-fowl blood, a graft-versus-host reaction occurred; this was known as the Simonsen phenomenon. Their work in this system would later help to explain passenger leukocytes in transplantation. The last project he worked on at the Institute was a study with assistant Margaret Holmes of autoimmune disease in the New Zealand black mouse model; this mouse has a high incidence of spontaneous autoimmune hemolytic anemia. They looked at the inheritance of autoimmune disease, and their use of immunosuppressive drug cyclophosphamide to treat the disease influenced the use of immunosuppressive drugs in human autoimmune disease.
In 1960, Burnet scaled back his laboratory work, taking one day off per week to concentrate on writing. In 1963, &quot;Autoimmune Diseases: Pathogenesis, Chemistry and Therapy&quot;, which he authored with Ian Mackay, was published. He also oversaw an expansion of the Hall Institute and secured funding from the Nuffield Foundation and the state government to build two further floors in the building and take over some of the space taken up by the pathology department at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. Despite this, Burnet believed that a world class research body needed to be small enough that one person could effectively run it, and maintained tight control over its activities throughout his leadership. He determined the policies himself, and personally selected all of the research staff and students, relying on a small staff to enforce his plans.

He continued to be active in the laboratory until his retirement in 1965, although his experimental time began to decrease as the operations became increasingly focused on immunology; Burnet&#x27;s work in this area had been mostly theoretical. Gustav Nossal became the next director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. Under Burnet&#x27;s leadership the Institute had become &quot;probably the world&#x27;s best known research centre devoted to the study of immunology.&quot; However, with the increasing sophistication in medical science and its reliance on more complicated technology, Burnet&#x27;s lone-wolf approach became less compatible with the research environment, which required more collaboration. In his final years at the helm, Burnet allowed more technical modernisation during the transition period to Nossal&#x27;s leadership.

==Public health and policy==
From 1937 Burnet was involved in a variety of scientific and public policy bodies, starting with a position on a government advisory council on polio. After he became the director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute in 1944, he was considered a public figure and overcame shyness to become a good public speaker. He recognised the importance of co-operation with the media if the general public was to understand science and scientists, and his writings and lectures played an important part in the formulation of public attitudes and policy in Australia on a variety of biological topics. However, despite making many appearances on radio and television, he never became at ease with interviews and had to be selective with outreach engagements due to the many invitations he received, and tended to accept those that had the potential to promote the Institute. Over time, he began to increase his activism, as he felt more confident that he would be able to make an impact as his reputation grew, especially after winning the Nobel Prize, and even more so after his retirement from the directorship of the Institute. Although Burnet was not naturally outgoing, he saw it as the social responsibility of a scientific leader and scholar to publicly speak out and impart wisdom and foresight to the wider community.

Burnet served as a member or chairman of scientific committees, both in Australia and overseas. Between 1947 and 1953, he was a member of the National Health and Medical Research Council&#x27;s Medical Research Advisory Committee. The committee advised on funding for medical research in Australia. During this same period (1947‚Äì52), he was also a member of the Commonwealth government&#x27;s Defence Research and Development Policy Committee. Declassified files from this committee show that Burnet made the recommendation that Australia pursue development of chemical and biological weapons to target the food stocks of &quot;Indonesia and other &quot;overpopulated&quot; countries of South-East Asia&quot; and spread infectious diseases. His report was titled &quot;War from a Biological Angle&quot;. Between 1955 and 1959, he was chairman of the Australian Radiation Advisory Committee; he was concerned that Australians were being exposed to unnecessary medical and industrial radiation.

Internationally, Burnet was a chairman of the Papua New Guinea Medical Research Advisory Committee between 1962 and 1969. At the time, Papua New Guinea was an Australian territory, and Burnet had first travelled there as his son was posted there. His role on the committee allowed him to explore his interest in human biology. He was particularly interested in kuru (laughing sickness), and lobbied the Australian government to establish the Papua New Guinea Institute of Human Biology. Burnet later helped oversee the institute&#x27;s contribution to the Anglo-Australian participation in the International Biological Programme in the Field of Human Adaptability.

Burnet served as first chair for the Commonwealth Foundation (1966‚Äì69), a Commonwealth initiative to foster interaction between the member countries&#x27; elite, and he was also active in the World Health Organization, serving on the Expert Advisory Panels on Virus Diseases and on Immunology between 1952 and 1969 and the World Health Organization Medical Research Advisory Committee between 1969 and 1973.

In 1964, he was appointed to sit on the University Council of Victoria&#x27;s third university La Trobe on an interim basis until the institution was formed in 1966. He served until 1970. He advocated a less hierarchical relationship between a professor and student, something seen as a move away from the English tradition prevalent in Australia towards an American model. He also called for the downgrading of the importance placed on the liberal arts. His ideas were too radical for his peers and he stepped down from the role in 1970 after none of his suggestions had made an impact.

Burnet was opposed to the use of nuclear power in Australia owing to the issues of nuclear proliferation. He later retracted his objections to uranium mining in Australia, feeling that nuclear power was necessary while other renewable energy sources were being developed. In the late 1960s and 1970s, he was also vocal in the anti-smoking movement; he was one of the first high-profile figures in Australia to educate the public on the dangers of tobacco, and he appeared in a television advertisement criticising the ethics of tobacco advertising, and broadcasters for displaying such material. He and fellow activists were surprised that the commercial was allowed to run briefly, before being taken off air by the station, which only further generated attention for the anti-smoking campaign. A former smoker, he had rejected the habit in the 1950s after several friends died. Burnet was also a critic of the Vietnam War and called for the creation of an international police force.

==Later life==
Following his resignation from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Burnet was offered an office at the University of Melbourne in the School of Microbiology. While at the university, he wrote 13 books on a variety of topics including immunology, ageing and cancer, and human biology. He also wrote an autobiography entitled &quot;Changing Patterns: An Atypical Autobiography&quot;, which was released in 1968. In all, he wrote a further 16 books after his retirement from the Hall Institute. He was known for his ability to write quickly, often without a final draft, and his ability to convey a message to readers from a wide spectrum of backgrounds, but he was himself sceptical that his opinions had much influence. In 1969 he published &quot;Cellular Immunology&quot;, considered his magnum opus on immunity, which attempted to show how various phenomena could be predicted by the clonal selection theory. The following year, he wrote &quot;Immunological Surveillance&quot;, which expounded his established opinion that mammals could immunise themselves through their ability to detect foreign patterns in the body. He continued to maintain an intense and focused work schedule, often shunning others to keep up a heavy writing load.

He became president of the Australian Academy of Science in 1965, having been a foundational fellow when the Academy was formed in 1954. He had been offered the presidency in 1958 to replace the inaugural head Sir Mark Oliphant, but declined, although he served on the council and as vice president in 1961‚Äì63. As president he was recognised by both government and the public as the leading scientist in Australia. His stature as a scientist gave him the gravitas to end policy disputes, and gave the Academy and its advocacy more credibility in the eyes of government and industry. As such his term was considered to be highly successful. Oliphant said that Burnet&#x27;s personal prestige was very important in the increased respect the AAS won and that he &quot;made the biological sciences far more acceptable in Australia&quot;.

He helped establish the Academy&#x27;s Science and Industry Forum, which was formed in the second year of his leadership in order to improve dialogue between researchers and industrialists. It investigated whether a national science policy should be formulated and led to the eventual creation of the Australian Science and Technology Council. He also laid the foundations of the Australian Biological Resources Study. When his presidency ended in 1969, the Academy founded the Macfarlane Burnet Medal and Lecture, which is the Academy&#x27;s highest award for biological sciences.

As in many of his previous pursuits, Burnet set an ambitious agenda for himself but ran into difficulties. He saw the Academy as the peak lobby group of the scientific community and their main liaison with government and industry. He tried to lift its profile and use it to persuade the political and industrial leadership to invest more in science. He also wanted to use the Academy to increase the involvement of the eminent scientists of Australia in training and motivating the next generation, but these initiatives were not successful due to a lack of concrete method. Most controversially, he tried to change the membership criteria of the Academy. He wanted to stop the Royal Society from operating in Australia and accepting new Australian members. He reasoned that the Australian Academy would not be strong if the Royal Society would be able to compete with it, and he felt that if Australian scientists were allowed to possess membership of both bodies, the more established Royal Society would make the Australian Academy look poor in comparison. Questions were raised over the existing dual members‚Äîsuch as Burnet‚Äîbeing able to maintain their status and the hypocrisy thereby entailed in Burnet&#x27;s nationalistic proposal, and it was defeated heavily.

In 1966, Burnet accepted a nomination from Australia Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies to become the inaugural chairman of the Commonwealth Foundation, a body that aimed to increase the professional interchange between the various nations of the British Commonwealth. Burnet served in the role for three years and helped start it on a path of steady growth, although he was unable to use it as a personal platform to espouse the importance of human biology.

Burnet&#x27;s essays and books published in his later life caused contention within the scientific community and to the chagrin of his peers Burnet often made pessimistic proclamations about the future of science. In 1966 Burnet wrote an opinion article for &quot;The Lancet&quot; entitled &quot;Men or Molecules?&quot; in which he questioned the usefulness of molecular biology, arguing that it had not and would not contribute anything of use to medicine and that manipulation of the genome as had been demonstrated in bacteria would do more harm to humans than good. Gustav Nossal subsequently described Burnet as &quot;a biologist with a love-hate affair with biochemistry, which led to a brief but damaging rejection of the worth of molecular biology.&quot;

He delivered the inaugural Oscar Mendelsohn lecture in 1971 at Monash University and advocated policies for Australia such as population control, prevention of war, long-term plans for the management of the environment and natural resources, Aboriginal land rights, socialism, recycling, advertising bans on socially harmful products, and more regulation of the environment. He angrily denounced French nuclear testing in the Pacific, and after consistently voting for the ruling Liberal Party coalition as it ruled for the past few decades, signed an open letter backing the opposition Labor Party of Gough Whitlam, which took power in 1972. However, he soon spoke out against Whitlam&#x27;s lack of action against tobacco advertising and French nuclear tests. Burnet often found himself frustrated with the refusal of politicians to base policy on long-term objectives, such as the sustainability of human life.

In 1971‚Äì72, he wrote four books, most notably, &quot;Genes, Dreams and Realities&quot;, which caused great controversy due to its strident attacks on molecular biology, cellular biology, and claims that cancer and various other diseases were incurable and that it was pointless to try to do so. He also predicted that scientific progress would end soon.

Burnet spoke and wrote widely on the topic of human biology after his retirement, aiming to reach all strata of society. He courted the media as well as the scientific community, often leading to sensationalist or scientifically unrigorous report of his outspoken views. This often angered colleagues, who viewed him as abusing his stature to deliberately cause a stir. In 1966 Burnet presented the Boyer Lectures, focusing on human biology. He provided a conceptual framework for sustainable development; 21 years later the definition provided by the Brundtland Commission was almost identical. In 1970 he revised an earlier book which was published as &quot;Dominant Mammal: the Biology of Human Destiny&quot;; it was followed by &quot;Endurance of Life&quot;, which was published in 1978. The books discuss aspects of human biology, a topic which Burnet wrote on extensively in his later years. In &quot;Dominant Mammal&quot; he argued that the roots of all human behaviour can be found in the behaviour of animals; in &quot;Endurance&quot; he addressed issues of ageing, life, death and the future of mankind. The books strongly polarised the scientific community, and one reviewer described his ideas of sociobiology as &quot;extreme&quot; and giving &quot;a dismal, unappealing view of humanity&quot;. In &quot;Endurance of Life&quot;, he also called for society to accept euthanasia of ill older people, repeat violent criminals, and most controversially, abortion of pregnancies likely to result in disabled children, and infanticide of handicapped newborns. Knowing that there would be a strong backlash for such policies, he departed overseas for a two-month lecture series at the time of the book launch. In his absence, he was strongly assailed in newspaper letters and some correspondents compared his stance on infanticide to that of Adolf Hitler. At the same time, he also changed his stance on nuclear power and advocated its use, and the reinvestment of revenue for research into solar power. This about face angered the environmental movement.

His first wife, Edith Linda Druce, died from lymphoid leukaemia in 1973, after a four-year struggle. During her final years, Burnet refused all offers of lectures overseas to spend more time nursing his ailing wife. For a period after this he became very lethargic and reclusive, numbed by his wife&#x27;s death. He then moved into Ormond College for company, and resumed beetle collecting, but for a year after her death, Burnet tried to alleviate his grief by writing mock letters to her once a week. Gradually he regained his enthusiasm and began writing again. In 1975, he travelled to California to deliver a series of lectures. In 1976 he married Hazel G. Jenkins, a widowed former singer from a business family in her 70s who was working in the microbiology department as a librarian, and moved out of Ormond College.

In 1978 Burnet decided to officially retire; in retirement he wrote two books. During this time, he missed his laboratory work, and he was constrained to social events and theorising. In 1982, Burnet was one of three contributors to &quot;Challenge to Australia&quot;, writing about genetic issues and their impact on the nation&#x27;s impact. As a result of the success of the book, in early 1983, Burnet was appointed to the 70-person Australian Advisory Council of Elders to offer counsel to policymakers, but the group folded after several members became too frail or died.

Burnet continued to travel and speak, but in the early 1980s, he and his wife became increasingly hampered by illness. Having surmised his illness two years earlier, in November 1984 he underwent surgery for colorectal cancer. He made plans to resume scientific meetings, but was then taken ill again, with significant pain in his thorax and legs. Secondary lesions were found in June 1985 and declared to be inoperable and terminal. A supporter of euthanasia, Burnet was unfazed by his imminent death, and he died on 31 August at his son&#x27;s home at Port Fairy after two months&#x27; of illness. He was given a state funeral by the government of Australia; many of his distinguished colleagues from the Hall Institute such as Nossal and Fenner were pall-bearers, and he was buried near his paternal grandparents after a private family service at Tower Hill cemetery in Koroit, near Port Fairy. Following his death he was honoured by the House of Representatives; Prime Minister Bob Hawke took the highly unusual step of moving a condolence motion, an honour typically reserved for parliamentarians. Lady Hazel Burnet died in 1990.

== Global policy ==
He was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt the Constitution for the Federation of Earth.

==Honours and legacy==
Burnet received extensive honours for his contributions to science and public life during his lifetime. He was knighted in the 1951 New Year Honours, received the Elizabeth II Coronation Medal in 1953, and was elected appointed to the Order of Merit (OM) in the 1958 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours. In 1960 he was the first recipient of the Australian of the Year award. He received a Gold and Silver Star from the Japanese Order of the Rising Sun in 1961. In 1962 he was awarded the Mueller Medal by the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science.He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1969 New Year Honours, and received the Elizabeth II Jubilee Medal in 1977. In 1978 he was made a Knight of the Order of Australia (AK). He was only the fourth person to receive this honour.

He was a fellow or honorary member of 30 international Academies of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society. He received 10 honorary D.Sc. degrees from universities including Cambridge, Harvard and Oxford, an honorary M.D. degree from Hahnemann Medical College (now part of Drexel University), an honorary Doctor of Medical Science from the Medical University of South Carolina and a LL.D. degree from the University of Melbourne. Including his Nobel, he received 19 medals or awards including the Royal Medal and the Copley Medal from the Royal Society and the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research; he also received 33 international lectureships and 17 lectureships within Australia.

After his death, Australia&#x27;s largest communicable diseases research institute‚Äîthe Macfarlane Burnet Centre for Medical Research was renamed in his honour. The Burnet Clinical Research Unit of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute was also named in his honour in 1986. In 1975 his work on immunology was recognised by a 33-cent stamp released by Australia Post. Seven Australian medical scientists were commemorated in the issue of a set of four Australian stamps released in 1995; he appears on the 45-cent stamp with fellow University of Melbourne graduate Jean Macnamara. He also appears on a Dominican stamp that was issued in 1997. The centenary of his birth was celebrated in Australia in 1999; a statue of him was erected in Franklin Street, Traralgon; and several events were held in his honour including the release of a new edition of by Oxford University Press.

Burnet biographer Christopher Sexton suggests that Burnet&#x27;s legacy is fourfold: (1) the scope and quality of his research; (2) his nationalistic attitude which led him to stay in Australia, leading to the development of science in Australia and inspiring future generations of Australian scientists; (3) his success establishing the reputation of Australian medical research worldwide; and (4) his books, essays and other writings. In spite of his sometimes controversial ideas on science and humanity, Peter C. Doherty has noted that &quot;Burnet&#x27;s reputation is secure in his achievements as an experimentalist, a theoretician and a leader of the Australian scientific community.&quot;

<doc id="417497" wikidata="Q7347473" url="?curid=417497" title="Robert McCartney (Northern Irish politician)">
<text>Robert Law McCartney, KC (born 24 April 1936), known as Bob McCartney, is a Northern Irish barrister and Unionist politician who was leader of the UK Unionist Party (UKUP) from 1995 to 2007.

He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for North Down from 1995 to 2001, and a Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly (MLA) for North Down from 1998 to 2007.

==Political career==
McCartney was initially a member of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), and was first elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly in the 1982 Assembly election for North Down. He was later expelled from the UUP in June 1987, when he refused to withdraw from the general election of that year. He stood against the incumbent Popular Unionist Party MP Sir James Kilfedder in North Down as a &quot;Real Unionist&quot;, but failed to win the seat.

In the 1995 by-election in North Down, after the death of Kilfedder, he was elected as a &quot;UK Unionist&quot; defeating the Ulster Unionist Party candidate. He subsequently established the United Kingdom Unionist Party to contest elections to the Northern Ireland Forum and the related talks which started in 1996. The other party representatives to the forum were Conor Cruise O&#x27;Brien and Cedric Wilson, a former low-level DUP member in the 1980s. McCartney retained his Westminster seat in the 1997 election.

He opposed the subsequent Good Friday Agreement in the May 1998 referendum and his party won five seats in the Assembly elections later that year (McCartney himself in North Down, Cedric Wilson in Strangford, Patrick Roche in Lagan Valley, Norman Boyd in South Antrim and Roger Hutchinson in East Antrim).

However, Wilson, Roche, Boyd and Hutchinson parted company with McCartney in December 1998 because of their leader&#x27;s so-called &#x27;exit strategy&#x27; from the Northern Ireland Assembly in the event of Sinn F√©in being allowed seats in the new Northern Ireland Government. McCartney denounced them, saying all four were &quot;famous in their own living rooms&quot; and that their supporters could &quot;fit into a telephone box&quot;. In 2008 both Wilson and Boyd attended meetings of Jim Allister&#x27;s Traditional Unionist Voice.

In 1999, McCartney ran for the party in elections to the European Parliament, winning 2.9% of the first preference vote. He lost his Westminster seat in the 2001 election to the UUP candidate, Lady Sylvia Hermon.

He was committed to a policy of integration for Northern Ireland, whereby legislative devolution would no longer be Westminster&#x27;s abiding policy, there would be no Stormont Legislative Assembly and the province would be a fully participating part of the United Kingdom; at the same time, the three main British political parties would fully organise in Northern Ireland. He was the president of the Campaign for Equal Citizenship in 1986, and led it in its four years of prominence after the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement.
 McCartney resigned as head of the Campaign for Equal Citizenship in 1988 over a dispute with its executive.

These integrationist policies, once popular in some sections of Unionism, receded with the introduction of devolution to Scotland and Wales, and the creation of a functioning Northern Ireland Assembly. However it is the case that other parts of the United Kingdom with devolved assemblies are fully covered by the three main British political parties, but not Northern Ireland.

McCartney also strongly opposed the St Andrews Agreement and in 2007 stood on an anti-agreement ticket in six constituencies. He lost his own seat in North Down, polling 1,806 first preference votes (5.9% of the total, and less than half the quota required to be elected). He also obtained 360 votes (1.2%) in Belfast North, 388 votes (0.8%) in Fermanagh and South Tyrone, 853 votes (2.0%) in Lagan Valley, 893 votes (2.3%) in South Antrim and 220 votes (0.5%) in West Tyrone.

==Retirement==
McCartney claimed to have retired from politics following the loss of his seat in the 2007 Assembly Election to Brian Wilson of the Green Party. However, he still occasionally makes media appearances and writes newspaper articles. In October 2009, McCartney was guest speaker at the Traditional Unionist Voice party conference in Belfast, where he spoke on the situation surrounding the primary school transfer test, brought about by a Sinn F√©in Education Minister.

<text>Kumasi is a city and the capital of the Kumasi Metropolitan Assembly and the Ashanti Region of Ghana. It is the second largest city in the country, with a population of 443,981 as of the 2021 census. Kumasi is located in a rain forest region near Lake Bosomtwe and is located about from Accra. The city experiences a tropical savanna climate, with two rainy seasons which range from minor to major. Major ethnic groups who lived in Kumasi are the Asante, Mole-Dagbon and Ewe. As of 2021, the mayor of the metropolitan is Samuel Pyne.

The city was the capital of the Asante Empire, which at its peak covered large parts of present-day Ghana and the Ivory Coast. After getting taken over by the British in 1896 along with experiencing a fast population growth, Kumasi rapidly grew with improvements to its infrastructure, such as roads and the additions of railways. After Ghana gained its independence in 1957, the city became the capital of the Ashanti Region. Kumasi remains the seat of the &quot;Asantehene&quot;. The city is often regarded as &quot;The Garden City&quot; after Maxwell Fry published his 1945 &quot;Garden City of West Africa&quot; plan for the city. It is also due to the abundance of gardens and forestry in the city.

Kumasi is a commercial, economic, and trading hub in Ghana, home to the biggest market in West Africa: the Kejetia Market. The city is the centre of Asante culture, hence also being nicknamed &quot;Osei-Krom&quot; or simply &quot;Oseikrom&quot;, along with attracting many visitors. The city is also home to numerous trade associations, such as the Aboabo Talia Producers&#x27;
Association. Half of the country&#x27;s timber processing takes place in the city. The Centre for National Culture, Wesley College of Education, and Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital are all located in the city.

== History ==
=== Etymology ===
Kumasi derived from the Twi word &quot;Kumase&quot;, meaning &#x27;under the kum tree&#x27; in which &quot;kum&quot; meant &#x27;the tree&#x27; and &quot;ase&quot; means &#x27;under&#x27;. The word was the name of an &quot;Okum&quot; tree in Kwaman, planted by Okomfo Anokye.

=== Early settlement ===

Kumasi was founded in the 1680s by Asantehene Osei Kofi Tutu I as the capital of the Ashanti Empire. Various accounts exist on the formation of the city. One states that Osei Tutu negotiated for the land under a Kum Tree, providing the origin of the name Kumasi. Other oral sources state it was Nana Oti Akenten who negotiated with the chief of Tafo for a plot of land under a Kum tree. Other traditions indicate that Oti built Kwaman and it was his son Nana Obiri Yeboa who created Kumasi instead. The majority of oral sources attribute the choice of site to Okomfo Anokye who was said to have planted two Kum seeds; one in Kwaman and another in Kumawu as he decreed that the one which grew would be designated as the capital of Osei Tutu&#x27;s empire. Kumasi was built over the eastern slopes of a ridge, rising from the marshes of the Nsuben rivers.

=== Ashanti Empire ===
The city rose to prominence in 1695, when it became the capital of the Ashanti Empire due to the activities of its ruler, Osei Tutu. The ruler of Kumasi, known as the Asantehene, also served as the ruler of the empire. With their 1701 victory over Denkyira, the Ashanti empire became the primary state among the Ashantis. In 1718‚Äì19, Aowin King Ebirimoro invaded Kumasi and sacked the capital. Asantehene Opoku Ware I was able to &quot;beat back&quot; this invasion.

European sources in the late 19th century mentioned the city&#x27;s neatness such as the account of F. Boyle in 1874 who stated that Kumasi&#x27;s smells &quot;are never those of sewage&quot; as well as Brackenbury, who wrote around 1873 that &quot;the streets are generally very broad and clean, and ornamented with many beautiful banyan-trees affording grateful shade from the powerful rays of the sun.&quot; In contrast, William Butler described the city as &#x27;a filthier, and far more blood-stained collection of mud and wattle hovels than any other village in the forest.&#x27; Parts of the city, including the then royal residence, were burnt by the British in the Third Anglo-Ashanti War of 1874.

In 1888, R. Austin Freeman was disappointed with the ruins of Kumasi following the British destruction in 1874 and the Ashanti civil war before 1888.
 Kumasi&#x27;s population during the time of the Ashanti Empire varied. In the early 19th century, Ashanti sources estimated a populace of 100,000 while European sources gave a figure around 12‚Äì15,000. According to historian Ivor Wilks, the city may have had a population of 40,000 in the 1860s.

Lady Mary Alice Hodgson, the first English lady to visit Ashanti, wrote &quot;The Siege of Kumasi&quot;, an account of the siege of the fort by the nationals of Ashanti and of the subsequent march to the coast. (She was the daughter of Hon. W. A. G. Young, C.M.G., former governor of the Gold Coast, and the wife of Sir Frederick Mitchell Hodgson, K.C.M.G., the governor of the Gold Coast in 1900.)

=== Colonial era ===

In 1926, following the return of the Ashanti King Prempeh I after 30-year in exile in Seychelles Island, Kumasi was vested with ceremonial control over the Ashanti sub-states. The full role of king was restored by the colonial administration in 1935. The city holds an important place in the history of the Ashanti people, as legend claims that it was here Okomfo Anokye received the golden stool, an embodiment of the soul of Ashanti nation.

=== Present Era ===
== Geography ==
=== Metropolitan area ===

Kumasi is located in the Kumasi Metropolitan, one of more than thirty districts in the Ashanti Region. It covers a land area of and is elevated above sea level. The metropolitan borders the Kwabre East Municipal District and Afigya Kwabre North District to the north, the Atwima Kwanwoma District and Atwima Nwabiagya Municipal District to the west, the Ejisu Municipal District and Asokore Mampong Municipal District towards the east and the Bosomtwe District to the south.

=== Environmental issues ===
Due to large amounts of encroachment, water pollution in the city is increasing, threatening rivers such as the Wiwi and the Subin. A 2024 report said that in the Kumasi Metropolitan, &quot;more land alongside the rivers was being used for industrial, residential and commercial purposes than for green spaces.&quot; The researchers criticized that &quot;city authorities were ineffective in controlling development in these areas&quot; and recommended that &quot;there should be a buffer of 100 feet (30 metres) along water bodies.&quot;

=== Climate ===
Kumasi has a tropical savanna climate (K√∂ppen climate classification &quot;Aw&quot;), with two distinct rainy seasons, major and minor. The major season usually occurs from March to July whilst the minor season is from September to November. The annual rainfall clocks in at around while the relative humidity ranges around 53% to 93%. The average monthly mean temperatures are around while the monthly minimum temperatures are about .

== Cityscape ==
=== Urban planning ===
Historically, the city was planned based on traditional land settlement patterns and land use systems of the Asante Empire. Although the city was not &#x27;formally&#x27; planned, it was considered to be well-organized with physical structures complying to the local culture and architecture. Some areas of Kumasi were declared as sacred. At the time of Bowdich&#x27;s visit in 1817, Kumasi was documented to have contained 27 streets. Another source in the mid-1880s identified 50 streets. In the present time, Kumasi is described as having unregulated informal activities, overdevelopment of slums, rapid urban growth, and poor services.

=== Housing ===
Compound houses are the most popular style of housing in Kumasi, being able to house 8 to 15 households on average. A typical compound house is usually a one-storey building containing single rooms surrounding a square courtyard. They are usually built using low-cost construction materials and by local labour. A 1996 study found that approximately 20% of home owners actually own their homes and more than 60% are migrants, either foreign or from other parts of Ghana.

== Government ==
Although Kumasi does not have a mayor on its own, the metropolitan it is located in and administrated by has a mayor‚Äìcouncil form of government. The mayor (executive chief) is appointed president of Ghana and approved by the city council, the Kumasi Metropolitan Assembly. As of 2021, the current mayor of the metropolitan is Samuel Pyne.

=== Sub-Metros ===
The metro is split up into 10 sub-metropolitan areas: Manhyia, Tafo, Suame, Asokwa, Oforikrom, Asawase, Bantama, Kwadaso, Nhyiaeso and Subin. The metro is also split up into 5 health districts: Asokwa, Subin, Bantama, Manhyia North and Manhyia South.

== Demographics ==

The population of the city of Kumasi is 443,981 people while the population of the metropolitan area is 3,490,030 people. One out of every five people in Kumasi are Christian, followed by Islam and traditional African religions. The largest ethnic group in the city is the Asante, followed by the Mole-Dagbon and Ewe people. Most of the population was born outside of the municipality, with about half being born outside the region.

== Culture ==

Kumasi is the centre of Asante culture, helping it to be nicknamed &quot;Osei-Krom&quot; or simply &quot;Oseikrom&quot;. Kumasi is also known for its traditional textile, kente, usually always made using traditional practices. It is home to the largest market in West Africa, the Kejetia Market, home to over 10,000 stores and stalls. Places with cultural background(s) in the city include Fort Kumasi (built by in 1896 to replace an Asante fort and now a museum) and the Nurom Hat Museum. Royal Asante attractions include the Centre for National Culture (including the Prempeh II Jubilee Museum with Asante regalia with a reproduction of the golden stool), the Okomfo Anokye Sword, the Asantehene&#x27;s Palace (built in 1972), and the Manhyia Palace, dating from 1925, now a museum.

=== Media ===
Media in Kumasi is regulated by the Public Relations Unit of the Kumasi Metropolitan. In total, there are 36 media outlets in the metro, of this are 4 television organizations, 20 FM stations, and 13 print media organizations.

==== Film ====

Film in Kumasi, nicknamed &quot;Kumawood&quot;, is a rapidly growing industry appealing to those who lack access to education but have a passion for acting. The industry mainly focuses on local storylines, along with being set in village surroundings usually on a low budget ranging from $6,860 to $11,440, sharing similarities with Wakaliwood. The films are spoken in the local language, which is Twi.

The first documented movie theatre to open in Kumasi was the Rex cinema, constructed in 1938. It was located at the Prempeh Assembly Hall, which was at the time one of the largest gathering places in the city. A second one was built in 1951, housed about 1,500 seats. These theatres were owned by the West African Picture Company, a Lebanese-owned business which operated in the Gold Coast, Nigeria, and London. Hindi films were popular among residents, more notably the Muslim populations.

== Economy ==
The Ashanti Region accounted for 21% of total national output of Ghana in 2014, of which 48% was situated in the city of Kumasi alone. This makes the city an economic centre in the country. Much of the city&#x27;s wealth is derived from being the middle point of many of Ghana&#x27;s main roads, along with cacao farming in the hinterland. The main occupations in Kumasi are professional, such as services and manufacturing.

=== Manufacturing ===
Since the 1960s the city has been home to many businesses, big and small, contributing to the city&#x27;s economic growth. In fact, two-thirds of all non-household businesses in Ashanti was in Kumasi. Kaase and Suame are known as heavily industrialized areas, being the home for many mechanic shops and businesses, such as Guinness Ghana Breweries and a Coca-Cola Bottling Company United branch.

<text>Edward Kevin McGrady (3 June 1935 ‚Äì 11 November 2013) was an Irish nationalist politician of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), who was the  Member of Parliament (MP) for South Down from 1987 to 2010.

McGrady was also a  Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly (MLA) for South Down from 1998 to 2003.

== Early life ==
Born in Downpatrick, County Down, Northern Ireland, one of eleven children, McGrady was educated at St Patrick&#x27;s Grammar School, Downpatrick and at Belfast Technical College, where he trained as a chartered accountant, subsequently entering his family&#x27;s accountancy firm.

== Political career ==
McGrady entered politics in 1961 as an Independent Nationalist councillor on Downpatrick Urban Council, serving as chairman from 1964 until the council was replaced by Down District Council in 1973.

In the late 1960s he joined the National Democrats and stood for the party in the 1969 election to the Parliament of Northern Ireland in East Down, losing to the sitting MP and future Prime Minister of Northern Ireland Brian Faulkner.

In 1970 he became a founder member of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), later serving as its first chairman (from 1971‚Äì1973). He sat on Down District Council from 1973 to 1989, serving as chairman from 1974‚Äì1975 and was also elected to all three regional assemblies in 1973, 1975 and 1982 representing South Down. In the 1973 power-sharing executive he was appointed as Head of the Department of Executive Planning and Co-ordination, serving from January to May 1974.

In Westminster elections he contested South Down unsuccessfully in 1979, 1983 and at the by-election of January 1986, losing on each occasion to Enoch Powell, the sitting MP. He succeeded at the fourth attempt in the general election of 1987 and held the seat until retiring in 2010. His tenure was briefly threatened in the mid-1990s when the Boundary Commission suggested merging much of his constituency with the neighbouring Newry and Armagh constituency to form a new &#x27;Newry and Mourne&#x27; constituency. This was overturned during a local review, which preserved his seat and actually removed more Unionist sections such as Dromore. McGrady&#x27;s support held solid over the years despite talk of a slippage, and this was reinforced in the 2005 Westminster election with his re-election to the House of Commons.

McGrady formerly sat on the Northern Ireland Policing Board and was a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly between 1998 and 2003.

On 25 February 2010, McGrady announced that he would stand down at the 2010 General Election.

McGrady continued to be chairperson of the Lecale Branch of the SDLP.

<text>Sylvia Eileen, Lady Hermon (n√©e Paisley; born 11 August 1955) is a retired Unionist politician from Northern Ireland. She served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of North Down from 2001 to 2019.

She was first elected for the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), but left the party in 2010, sitting as an Independent unionist for the rest of her time as Member of Parliament. She is the widow of Sir Jack Hermon, who served as Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. She was the only independent MP elected at the 2010 general election, 2015 general election and 2017 general election.

On 25 March 2010, Lady Hermon announced her resignation from the Ulster Unionist Party, and had served since then as an Independent MP. Her decision was triggered by the Ulster Unionist alliance with the Conservative Party. She successfully retained her seat in the 2010 election with a large gain in her share of the vote, increasing her majority, retaining the seat again in the 2015 election. She also retained her seat in 2017 with a reduced 41% of the vote.

She announced her decision not to contest her seat at the December 2019 general election in November 2019.

==Background==
Born Sylvia Eileen Paisley, a Presbyterian in the mainly Republican area of Galbally, County Tyrone, her father was Robert Paisley, a farmer, and she had three sisters. Hermon&#x27;s mother accidentally drowned when Hermon was four. She went to Dungannon High School before studying Law at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth.

She lectured in Law at the Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast at the same time as David Trimble. She did not enter politics until 1998, when she joined the Ulster Unionist Party, having been impressed by the role the party had played in negotiating the Good Friday Agreement.

On 6 November 2008, her husband Sir John Hermon died. Shortly afterward, her father also died.

She is a long-standing supporter of the Alzheimer&#x27;s Research Trust and helped launch its Northern Ireland network centre.

==Political career==
Within the UUP, Hermon was regarded as being on the more socially liberal wing of the party, being characterised in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2005 as a &#x27;liberal&#x27;. She was chosen as UUP candidate for the North Down constituency to contest the 2001 general election, and defeated the incumbent Robert McCartney of the UK Unionist Party by over 7,000 votes. During the election she gained the support of the local branch of the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, who withdrew their own candidate.

Hermon became chair of the North Down branch of the UUP in 2001 and held this position until 2003. In 2001 she was also appointed UUP spokesperson for Youth and Women&#x27;s Issues, Home Affairs and Trade and Industry. She subsequently lost the Trade and Industry portfolio and took responsibility for Culture, Media and Sport in 2002. Outside of the UUP, Hermon has also been involved in policing support and pensioners&#x27; rights campaigns.

In 2003, she voted in favour of the Iraq War.

Hermon was the only Ulster Unionist to be returned to Westminster in the 2005 general election and as a result figured in consideration for who would succeed David Trimble as party leader. Initially considered to be amongst the frontrunners, Hermon eventually declined the opportunity, feeling that she could not combine it with her responsibility of caring for her husband, who suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and instead supported the unsuccessful bid of Alan McFarland.

In 2009, Hermon announced her opposition to the Ulster Unionist link-up with the Conservative Party. She declared, in an unplanned announcement, during an interview in her constituency office, At the present time, I can&#x27;t see myself standing under a Conservative banner ... If my party chooses to move to call themselves by a different name, I&#x27;m terribly sorry and terribly disappointed by that but I remain an Ulster Unionist. That was certainly my mandate and I&#x27;ve loved serving the people of North Down. They have stood by me through the most difficult of times and if they choose and wish me to serve them I would do my very best to do that.

On 23 February 2010, Hermon confirmed that she would not be seeking the nomination as a Conservative and Unionist candidate. In her parliamentary votes, she was closer to the Labour Party than the Conservative Party. On 6 May 2010, standing as an Independent unionist candidate, she was re-elected with a majority of over 14,000 votes ahead of the &quot;Ulster Conservatives and Unionists ‚Äì New Force&quot; candidate. She was re-elected in May 2015 and June 2017, both times as an Independent unionist, and the only independent MP elected in those Parliaments.

Although Hermon had previously been considered to be close to the Labour Party, she has said that she would not support the leader at the time, Jeremy Corbyn, in government. Hermon announced in November 2019 that she would not be standing as a candidate in the 2019 general election on 12 December. Her constituency position went to Stephen Farry of the Alliance Party.

=== Brexit ===
Hermon campaigned for the United Kingdom to remain in the European Union during the 2016 referendum on Brexit. Given that Sinn F√©in, who also supported a Remain vote, abstain from taking up their seats in the House of Commons, and the DUP supported a Leave vote, Hermon was the only MP representing Northern Ireland in the 2017 Parliament who supported Remain. Hermon described the potential for a &quot;no-deal&quot; Brexit as a &quot;threat to UK stability&quot; and said that it could lead to a hard border, which could, combined with changing demographics in Northern Ireland, lead to a border poll on a united Ireland, which could lead to Northern Ireland uniting with the Republic of Ireland.

Hermon voted in favour of the Withdrawal Agreement in the meaningful vote on 15 January 2019, which was defeated by 432 votes to 202. She voted against the motion of no confidence in the government of Theresa May called by Jeremy Corbyn the following day. During the phase of indicative votes in Parliament, Hermon voted in favour of a second referendum, as well as the option of revoking Article 50 to avoid a no-deal Brexit.

<text>Middle Georgia College (MGC) was a four-year state college unit of the University System of Georgia, United States. On January 8, 2013, it was consolidated with Macon State College into a new institution, which is now known as Middle Georgia State University.

The college&#x27;s main campus was in Cochran, and that campus is now a satellite campus of Middle Georgia State University. The campus continues to operate with the same facilities as it had before consolidation. MGC had two other campuses ‚Äî located in Eastman and Dublin ‚Äî and they also continue to operate as campuses of Middle Georgia State University.

== History ==
Middle Georgia College dates back to the establishment of New Ebenezer College, which occupied the site of the current Cochran campus of Middle Georgia State University and was established in 1884 by the New Ebenezer Baptist Association. The association was composed largely of Baptist churches in Pulaski, Dodge, Laurens, and Telfair counties.

The first building on the campus was completed in 1886, and classes were first held in 1887 with approximately 100 students. During the early period, the institution was divided into preparatory and collegiate departments. A stated purpose of the curriculum, as described in the catalog of 1887, was &quot;to prepare pupils for business or for the Junior Class in Universities. This includes Latin, Greek, Mathematics, Natural Science and several modern languages, with English studies and Music.&quot; The New Ebenezer Baptist Association discontinued their financial support for their namesake college in 1898, forcing the school to close its doors.

The college&#x27;s building served as a high school for the city of Cochran until 1913, when the high school moved. No documentation exists regarding the facilities from 1913 to 1919, leading to the presumption that it was unoccupied during that time.

In 1919, the Georgia State College of Agricultural and Mechanic Arts (a division of the University of Georgia) opened a branch dedicated to serving the needs of the Twelfth congressional district in the building formerly used by New Ebenezer College. In 1927, the school&#x27;s name was changed to Middle Georgia Agricultural and Mechanical Junior College, though it remained a branch of the state agricultural school. In 1929, the school&#x27;s name was changed to Middle Georgia College and responsibility for its operation was given to a nine-person board of trustees.

MGC was finally made an independent institution in 1931, when it was created as one of the original units of the newly created University System of Georgia.

During World War II, MGC hosted the 50th College Training Detachment of the U.S. Army Air Force and graduated 17 classes of aviation students from March 1943- July 1944.

In 1964, Dr. Louis C. Alderman, Jr. become president. Many new buildings as well as renovations of existing facilities marked his tenure in growing the college&#x27;s reputation, academic excellence, and campus beauty. During this term, the Dublin Campus was opened in 1984. Dr. Alderman died on December 13, 1987, having served the longest term of any past or subsequent president of the college. Alderman Community Hall was dedicated to his memory on May 21, 2009.

A new program and campus was added to the school in 2007, when the Georgia Aviation Technical College in Eastman was merged with Middle Georgia College.

In January 2012, the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia approved the consolidation of the college with Macon State College. The Board of Regents approved the name change to Middle Georgia State College on Tuesday, May 8, 2012, and also laid out a path for elevating the consolidated institution to university status after a review process. The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, the regional accrediting agency, gave its approval of the consolidation in December 2012, and the Board of Regents acted to make the consolidation official, effective immediately, on Jan. 8, 2013.

==Baseball program==

<doc id="417517" wikidata="Q358014" url="?curid=417517" title="Adler-32">
<text>Adler-32 is a checksum algorithm written by Mark Adler in 1995, modifying Fletcher&#x27;s checksum. Compared to a cyclic redundancy check of the same length, it trades reliability for speed. Adler-32 is more reliable than Fletcher-16, and slightly less reliable than Fletcher-32.

== History ==

The Adler-32 checksum is part of the widely used zlib compression library, as both were developed by Mark Adler.
A &quot;rolling checksum&quot; version of Adler-32 is used in the rsync utility.

== Calculation ==
An Adler-32 checksum is obtained by calculating two 16-bit checksums &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; and concatenating their bits into a 32-bit integer. &quot;A&quot; is the sum of all bytes in the stream plus one, and &quot;B&quot; is the sum of the individual values of &quot;A&quot; from each step.

At the beginning of an Adler-32 run, &quot;A&quot; is initialized to 1, &quot;B&quot; to 0. The sums are done modulo 65521 (the largest prime number smaller than 216). The bytes are stored in network order (big endian), &quot;B&quot; occupying the two most significant bytes.

The function may be expressed as

 &quot;A&quot; = 1 + &quot;D&quot;1 + &quot;D&quot;2 + ... + &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot; (mod 65521)
 &quot;B&quot; = (1 + &quot;D&quot;1) + (1 + &quot;D&quot;1 + &quot;D&quot;2) + ... + (1 + &quot;D&quot;1 + &quot;D&quot;2 + ... + &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot;) (mod 65521)
 = &quot;n&quot;√ó&quot;D&quot;1 + (&quot;n&quot;‚àí1)√ó&quot;D&quot;2 + (&quot;n&quot;‚àí2)√ó&quot;D&quot;3 + ... + &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot; + &quot;n&quot; (mod 65521)
 &quot;Adler-32&quot;(&quot;D&quot;) = &quot;B&quot; √ó 65536 + &quot;A&quot;

where &quot;D&quot; is the string of bytes for which the checksum is to be calculated, and &quot;n&quot; is the length of &quot;D&quot;.

==Example==
The Adler-32 sum of the ASCII string &quot;codice_1&quot; would be calculated as follows:
 A = 920 = 0x398 (base 16)
 B = 4582 = 0x11E6
 Output = (0x11E6 ¬´ 16) + 0x398 = 0x11E60398 = 300286872

The modulo operation had no effect in this example, since none of the values reached 65521.

==Comparison with the Fletcher checksum==

The first difference between the two algorithms is that Adler-32 sums are calculated modulo a prime number, whereas Fletcher sums are calculated modulo 24‚àí1, 28‚àí1, or 216‚àí1 (depending on the number of bits used), which are all composite numbers. Using a prime number makes it possible for Adler-32 to catch differences in certain combinations of bytes that Fletcher is unable to detect.

The second difference, which has the largest effect on the speed of the algorithm, is that the Adler sums are computed over 8-bit bytes rather than 16-bit words, resulting in twice the number of loop iterations. This results in the Adler-32 checksum taking between one-and-a-half to two times as long as Fletcher&#x27;s checksum for 16-bit word aligned data. For byte-aligned data, Adler-32 is faster than a properly implemented Fletcher&#x27;s checksum (e.g., one found in the Hierarchical Data Format).

==Example implementation==
In C, an inefficient but straightforward implementation is :

const uint32_t MOD_ADLER = 65521;

uint32_t adler32(unsigned char *data, size_t len) 
 where data is the location of the data in physical memory and 
 len is the length of the data in bytes 
{
 uint32_t a = 1, b = 0;
 size_t index;
 // Process each byte of the data in order
 for (index = 0; index &lt; len; ++index)
 a = (a + data[index]) % MOD_ADLER;
 b = (b + a) % MOD_ADLER;
 
 return (b ¬´ 16) | a;

See the zlib source code for a more efficient implementation that requires a fetch and two additions per byte, with the modulo operations deferred with two remainders computed every several thousand bytes, a technique first discovered for Fletcher checksums in 1988. provides a similar optimization, with the addition of a trick that delays computing the &quot;15&quot; in 65536 - 65521 so that modulos become faster: it can be shown that is equivalent to the naive accumulation.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
* Like the standard CRC-32, the Adler-32 checksum can be forged easily and is therefore unsafe for protecting against &quot;intentional&quot; modification.
* It&#x27;s faster than CRC-32 on many platforms.
* Adler-32 has a weakness for short messages with a few hundred bytes, because the checksums for these messages have a poor coverage of the 32 available bits.

==Weakness==

Adler-32 is weak for short messages because the sum &quot;A&quot; does not wrap. The maximum sum of a 128-byte message is 32640, which is below the value 65521 used by the modulo operation, meaning that roughly half of the output space is unused, and the distribution within the used part is nonuniform. An extended explanation can be found in , which mandates the use of
CRC32C instead of Adler-32 for SCTP, the Stream Control Transmission Protocol. Adler-32 has also been shown to be weak for small incremental changes, and also weak for strings generated from a common prefix and consecutive numbers (like auto-generated label names by typical code generators).

<doc id="417518" wikidata="Q336111" url="?curid=417518" title="Lynda Clark, Baroness Clark of Calton">
<text>Lynda Margaret Clark, Baroness Clark of Calton , known as Lady Clark of Calton, (born 26 February 1949) is a Scottish judge. She was formerly the Labour Member of Parliament for Edinburgh Pentlands. She was Advocate General for Scotland from the creation of that position in 1999 until 2006, whereupon she became a Judge of the Court of Session in Scotland.

==Career==
Clark read law at Queens College, St Andrews during its transition to independence as the University of Dundee School of Law, graduating in 1970 with an LL.B. (Hons) from St Andrews, and subsequently gained a PhD in criminology and penology from the University of Edinburgh in 1975 presenting the thesis &quot;Bail decision-making : law and practice in Scotland&quot;. She was a lecturer in Jurisprudence from 1973 at the University of Dundee until she was called to the Scottish Bar in 1977. She took silk in 1989, and was subsequently called to the English Bar in 1990 as a member of the Inner Temple.

=== Politics ===
Clark first stood for election to Parliament at the 1992 general election, where she unsuccessfully contested the North East Fife seat held by Menzies Campbell of the Liberal Democrats. At the 1997 general election, she was elected to the House of Commons for the Edinburgh Pentlands constituency, unseating the Conservative Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Malcolm Rifkind. Rifkind was one of the high-profile losses on election night for the Conservative Party, who experienced their worst defeat since the 1906 general election and lost all their seats in both Scotland and Wales.

In May 1999, Clark was appointed as the first-ever Advocate General for Scotland, a new post created by the Scotland Act 1998 to advise the Crown and Government of the United Kingdom on Scots law.

She stood down at the 2005 general election, allowing Secretary of State for Transport Alistair Darling to contest the new Edinburgh South West constituency.

On 13 May 2005, it was announced that Clark would be created a life peer, and on 21 June 2005 the title was gazetted as Baroness Clark of Calton, of Calton in the City of Edinburgh.

On 18 January 2006, Lady Clark of Calton resigned as Advocate General, pending an expected judicial appointment. She was replaced as Advocate General by Neil Davidson, QC (now Lord Davidson of Glen Clova).

=== Judge ===
On 19 January, Clark was appointed as a Senator of the College of Justice, a judge of the Supreme Courts of Scotland. She was installed in office in February 2006.

On 21 June 2012, Lady Clark succeeded Lord Drummond Young as chairman of the Scottish Law Commission. Lady Clark demitted office on 31 December 2013 in order to sit in the Inner House of the Court of Session, and was succeeded as chairman by Lord Pentland.

As of 2016, Lady Clark of Calton is the most recent Senator of the College of Justice to have served in the House of Commons.

She retired from the bench in 2019.

<doc id="417528" wikidata="Q3405033" url="?curid=417528" title="Adam Price">
<text>Adam Robert Price (born 23 September 1968) is a Welsh politician who served as Leader of Plaid Cymru from September 2018 to May 2023. He has been the Member of the Senedd (MS) for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr since 2016, having previously been a Member of Parliament (MP) for the same Westminster constituency from 2001 to 2010.

==Early life and career==
Price was born in Carmarthen and grew up in Tycroes. His father, Rufus, was a miner at Betws Colliery. His parents were Welsh speakers, but raised their children to speak English; Price was taught Welsh as a teenager by his brother Adrian. His parents were active in politics, starting a branch of Plaid Cymru in Ammanford, Carmarthenshire.

He went to Ysgol Dyffryn Aman in Ammanford. He later studied at Cardiff University, gaining a BA in European Community studies in 1991. He also studied at Saarland University in Saarbr√ºcken in Germany.

After graduating, Price worked as a research associate at Cardiff University&#x27;s department of city and regional planning. From 1998, he was the managing director of the Newidiem Economic Development Consultancy.

==Member of Parliament==
Price unsuccessfully contested the Gower seat in 1992 winning 3.5% of the vote. He was elected Member of Parliament for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr in 2001, holding the seat until he stood down in 2010.

In 2002, Price obtained a letter written by Tony Blair to the Romanian Government in support of Lakshmi Mittal&#x27;s LNM steel company, which was in the process of bidding to buy Romania&#x27;s state-owned steel industry. This revelation caused controversy, because Mittal had given ¬£125,000 to the British Labour Party the previous year. Although Blair defended his letter as simply &quot;celebrating the success&quot; of a British company, he was criticised because LNM was registered in the Dutch Antilles and employed less than 1% of its workforce in the UK. LNM was a &quot;major global competitor of Britain&#x27;s own struggling steel industry&quot;. Blair&#x27;s letter hinted that the privatisation of the firm and sale to Mittal might help smooth the way for Romania&#x27;s entry into the European Union. It also had a passage, removed prior to Blair&#x27;s signing of it, describing Mittal as &quot;a friend&quot;.

In 2004, Price announced his intention to begin a process of impeachment against Tony Blair following controversy over the Iraq War, with the backing of Plaid Cymru and SNP MPs as well as Boris Johnson and Nigel Evans. If successful, it could have seen Blair tried before the House of Lords; however, as expected, the measure failed. Price was ejected from the Commons chamber in 2005 after accusing the Prime Minister of having &quot;misled&quot; Parliament and then refusing to withdraw his comment, in violation of the rules of the House. In 2006, Price opened a three-hour debate on an inquiry into the Iraq War, the first such debate in over two years. The SNP and Plaid Cymru motion proposing a committee of seven senior MPs to review &quot;the way in which the responsibilities of government were discharged in relation to Iraq&quot;, was defeated by 298 votes to 273.

Writing in the Welsh language current affairs magazine &quot;Barn&quot; in April 2007, Price criticised UK government policy on drugs, indicating his support for their legalisation under medical supervision.

In August 2007, Price highlighted what he perceived as a lack of a Welsh focus in BBC news broadcasts. Price threatened to withhold future television licence fees in response to a lack of thorough news coverage of Wales, echoing a BBC Audience Council for Wales July report citing public frustration over how the Welsh Assembly is characterised in national media. Plaid AM Bethan Jenkins agreed with Price and called for responsibility for broadcasting to be devolved to the Welsh Assembly, voicing similar calls from Scotland&#x27;s First Minister Alex Salmond. Criticism of the BBC&#x27;s news coverage for Wales and Scotland since devolution prompted debate of possibly providing evening news broadcasts with specific focus for both countries.

Following the 2007 Welsh Assembly elections, a parliamentary standards and privileges committee found Plaid MPs Price, Elfyn Llwyd, and Hywel Williams guilty of improperly advertising during the elections. Though the committee acknowledged the MPs did not break any rules of the House of Commons, the committee believed the timing of the adverts were planned to coincide with the Assembly elections. Parliamentary funds are available for MPs to communicate with constituents regularly. However, the committee found that the three used this communication allowance improperly as part of Plaid&#x27;s campaigning during the elections as the adverts were placed in publications with a circulation outside of their respective constituencies. Of the committee findings, Plaid MP group leader Elfyn Llwyd said that they would comply with the findings of the committee, but that they had &quot;acted in good faith throughout, and fully in line with the advice that was offered to us by the DFA (Department of Finance and Administration) at the time of the publication of the reports&quot;. The MPs had to repay the money, about ¬£5,000 each, and report the costs as part of Plaid&#x27;s election spending.

In August 2007, Price began a regular column in the weekly Welsh language current affairs magazine &quot;Golwg&quot;.

Price has been a long-standing opponent to the war in Afghanistan and put forward an Early Day Motion calling for a timetable for withdrawal. Price has been critical of the strategy and objectives of the war.

In August 2010, Price announced he would not to stand in the 2011 Welsh Assembly elections, and instead stated he planned to spend a year in the United States on a Fulbright scholarship, before returning to the Welsh Assembly for the 2016 elections.

==Business and charity career==

In September 2010, he began studying at Harvard University, for a Master&#x27;s in Public Administration and gaining a fellowship at the Center for International Development in the John F. Kennedy School of Government. He returned to Wales two years later and helped form financial software firm Ideoba in Bridgend. The company collapsed and subsequently went bankrupt after being unable to secure further investment. He then worked for the innovation charity Nesta.

Between September and October 2014, Price presented a 3-part documentary series titled &quot;Streic&quot; (Strike) about the 1984‚Äì85 Welsh miners&#x27; strike, broadcast on S4C.

==Later political career==
Having stood down from the UK Parliament in 2010, he announced in 2013 his intention to re-enter politics and stand again for the National Assembly for Wales, and returned to politics when he was elected to the Assembly in 2016 for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr.

On 2 July 2018, Price published an article for WalesOnline where he called on Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood to accept proposals to implement a new co-leadership model for Plaid Cymru, &quot;where two leaders, male and female, jointly lead the party&quot;. He had criticised the direction of the party under Wood. Wood rejected the proposals, leading Price to challenge Wood for the leadership and declare his candidacy for the 2018 Plaid Cymru leadership election on 4 July, along with fellow Plaid Cymru AM Rhun ap Iorwerth.

Price proposed several new policies Plaid Cymru could adopt as part of his leadership bid. He suggested his party should use Wales&#x27;s incoming devolved powers on taxation to put one penny on income tax for increased funding in the education system. In August, Price released a ten-point policy plan setting out his vision for the Welsh economy, policies included: cuts and swaps to tax, a publicly owned Welsh energy company, infrastructure spending, and a job guarantee programme. A separate document he released for his campaign, &quot;Wales 2030: Seven Steps to Independence&quot;, detailed step-by-step measures his party could take to achieve Welsh independence by the year 2030.

===Leader of Plaid Cymru (2018‚Äì2023)===
In the 2018 Plaid Cymru leadership election, Price was elected leader of Plaid Cymru with almost half of members&#x27; votes, defeating incumbent leader, Leanne Wood. Price announced a new frontbench team the following month. In October 2018, Price revealed that he had recruited the SNP&#x27;s former deputy leader Angus Robertson to oversee a review of Plaid Cymru&#x27;s campaign strategy. Guest speaking at that month&#x27;s SNP conference, he backed calls for a second referendum on the UK&#x27;s membership of the European Union, and said he and his party would campaign to remain in the EU in the event of another referendum.

In January 2019, Price spoke in favour of cooperation among the Celtic nations of Britain and Ireland following Brexit. Among his proposals were a Celtic Development Bank for joint infrastructure and investment projects in energy, transport and communications in Ireland, Wales, Scotland and the Isle of Man and the foundation of a Celtic union the structure of which is already existent in the Good Friday Agreement according to Price. Speaking to RT√â, the Irish national broadcaster, he proposed Wales and Ireland working together to promote the indigenous languages of each nation.

At the 2019 general election, Plaid Cymru&#x27;s manifesto titled &#x27;Wales, It&#x27;s Us&#x27; included policies such as a second Brexit referendum in which the party would campaign to remain in the European Union, investment in the development of environmentally friendly industry referred to as a &#x27;green jobs revolution&#x27;, more funding for education and police, drug law reform, greater devolution of powers over tax and giving the devolved administrations a veto over the UK going to war. The party also formed an agreement with the Green Party and Liberal Democrats called the Unite to Remain alliance to stand down for each over in certain constituencies, Price described this decision as &quot;grownup politics&quot;. Plaid Cymru left the election with the same number of seats and a small decrease in its vote share.

In December 2020, Price promised that his party would hold a referendum on Welsh independence if it won a majority at the 2021 Senedd election though any such vote would need the agreement of the UK government. Other policies his party promised for that election included free school meals for every primary school child, lower average council tax along with more social and affordable housing, health professionals and eco friendly jobs. Price stated that he would form a government which would create a &quot;fairer, greener future where our country thrives by taking control of its own affairs and unleashing its greatest potential ‚Äì its people&quot;. The party made a net gain of one seat in that election with a slight reduction in its proportion of votes cast but lost second-place position to the Welsh Conservatives.

In November 2021, Price and Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford reached a co-operation agreement on policy in a wide range of areas. Ideas they planned to implement included free-at-the-point-of-use social care, expanding services for children and restrictions on second homes. The deal was the third time Welsh Labour and Plaid Cymru had agreed to work together in the era of devolution.

In May 2023, the publication of a report which detailed failings by the party to prevent sexual harassment and bullying led to media coverage suggesting that Price had agreed to resign the party leadership, and Price confirmed this in a statement on 10 May. Acknowledging that he &quot;no longer had the united support of [his] colleagues&quot;, Price stated that he would step down officially the following week, once the process for electing a new interim leader was finalised. On 11 May, Plaid Cymru announced that Llyr Gruffydd, Senedd member for North Wales, would replace him as interim party leader, and that this would be confirmed by the party&#x27;s National Executive Committee (NEC) on 13 May. The handover of power, including notifying the Electoral Commission, took place on 16 May after Price took part in his final First Minister&#x27;s Questions.

==Personal life==
Price is gay. He has two children. He also features in the Rainbow List of leading Welsh figures.

<doc id="417529" wikidata="Q1046613" url="?curid=417529" title="Casabianca (poem)">
<text>&quot;Casabianca&quot; is a poem by the English poet Felicia Dorothea Hemans, first published in &quot;The Monthly Magazine&quot;, Vol 2, August 1826.

The poem starts:

::The boy stood on the burning deck
::Whence all but he had fled;
::The flame that lit the battle&#x27;s wreck
::Shone round him o&#x27;er the dead.

It is written in ballad meter with the rhyme scheme ABAB. It is about the true story of a boy who was obedient enough to wait for his father&#x27;s orders, not knowing that his father is no longer alive. It is perhaps not widely realised that the boy in the poem is French and not English; his nationality is not mentioned.

==History==

The poem commemorates an actual incident that occurred in 1798 during the Battle of the Nile between British and French fleets on 1 August aboard the French flagship &quot;L&#x27;Orient&quot;. Giocante, the young son (his age is variously given as ten, twelve and thirteen) of the ship&#x27;s commander Luc-Julien-Joseph Casabianca remained at his post and perished when at 22:00 the fire reached the magazine and the &quot;Orient&quot; was destroyed by a massive explosion which damaged nearby ships.

==Narrative==

In Hemans&#x27; and other tellings of the story, young Casabianca refuses to desert his post without orders from his father. (It is sometimes said, rather improbably, that he heroically set fire to the magazine to prevent the ship&#x27;s capture by the British.) It is said that he was seen by British sailors on ships attacking from both sides, but how &quot;any&quot; other details of the incident are known beyond the bare fact of the boy&#x27;s death, is not clear. Hemans, not purporting to offer a history, but rather a poem inspired by the facts, writes:

::Yet beautiful and bright he stood,
::As born to rule the storm;
::A creature of heroic blood,
::A proud though child-like form.

::The flames rolled on‚Äîhe would not go
::Without his Father&#x27;s word;
::That Father, faint in death below,
::His voice no longer heard.

Hemans has him repeatedly, and heart-rendingly, calling to his father for instructions: &quot;&#x27;say, Father, say/If yet my task is done?&#x27;&quot; &quot;&#x27;Speak, Father!&#x27; once again he cried/&#x27;If I may yet be gone! And&#x27;&quot; at which point his voice is drowned out by &quot;booming shots&quot; until he &quot;shouted but once more aloud/&#x27;My Father! must I stay?&#x27;&quot; Alas, there is, of course, no response.

She concludes by commending the performances of both ship and boy:

::With mast, and helm, and pennon fair,
::That well had borne their part‚Äî
::But the noblest thing which perished there
::Was that young, faithful heart!

==Cultural impact==
This poem was a staple of elementary school readers in the United Kingdom and the United States over a period of about a century spanning roughly the 1850s through the 1950s. It is today remembered mostly as a tag line and as a topic of parodies. Some historians have claimed French poets also celebrated the event ‚Äì notably Andr√© Ch√©nier and Ponce Denis √âcouchard Lebrun ‚Äì apparently without noticing that the former was executed four years before the Battle of the Nile, so could not have written about these events. These claims for literary pedigree appear spurious.

The poem is referenced in Jack and Jill by Louisa May Alcott. A mother and children are discussing the actions of her son Jack, whom Jill responded that he was like Casabianca, &quot;...a fine example of entire obedience. He obeyed orders, and that is what we all must do, without always seeing why, or daring to use our own judgement.&quot;

The story is referenced in Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot;. In chapter VII, in a newspaper account of a storm, the dead pilot of the ship &quot;Demeter&quot; is compared to &quot;the young Casabianca&quot;.

The first line of the poem serves as the title and the inspiration for the short story &quot;The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck&quot; by C. S. Forester. In this version the hero, Ed Jones, remains at his station aboard the fictitious USS &quot;Boon&quot; during the Battle of Midway. A fire started in the bilge beneath his station in the engine room, but Jones remained at his station slowly roasting while the battle rages. At the conclusion of the battle he is relieved by a damage control party. Burned, he nonetheless survives the war.

In the book &quot;Swallowdale&quot; by Arthur Ransome, the Great Aunt is outmanoeuvered when she tasks Nancy and Peggy Blackett with learning the poem, without realising they already know it.

==Parody==
Generations of schoolchildren created parodies based on the poem. One, recalled by Martin Gardner, editor of &quot;Best Remembered Poems&quot;, went:

::The boy stood on the burning deck,
::The flames &#x27;round him did roar;
::He found a bar of Ivory Soap
::And washed himself ashore.

Spike Milligan also parodied the opening of the poem:
::The boy stood on the burning deck
::Whence all but he had fled -
::Twit! 

Eric Morecambe created another parody:
::The boy stood on the burning deck
::His lips were all a-quiver
::He gave a cough, his leg fell off
::And floated down the river.

American modernist Elizabeth Bishop created a poem based on this poem called &quot;Casabianca&quot; too:
::Love&#x27;s the boy stood on the burning deck
::trying to recite &quot;The boy stood on
::the burning deck.&quot; Love&#x27;s the son
::::stood stammering elocution
::::while the poor ship in flames went down.

::Love&#x27;s the obstinate boy, the ship,
::even the swimming sailors, who
::would like a schoolroom platform, too,
::::or an excuse to stay
::::on deck. And love&#x27;s the burning boy.

<text>Hugh James Saxton (born January 22, 1943) is an American politician from New Jersey. A member of the Republican Party, he represented parts of Burlington, Ocean, and Camden counties in the United States House of Representatives from 1984 to 2009. Before entering Congress, he served in the New Jersey Senate and the New Jersey General Assembly.

Saxton is a director emeritus on the board of New Jersey‚Äìbased energy equipment and systems company Holtec International.

==Life==
Born in Nicholson, Pennsylvania, on January 22, 1943, he attended East Stroudsburg State College (now East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania) and Temple University. He then pursued a career as an elementary public school teacher and small business owner. Saxton served in the New Jersey General Assembly (the lower chamber of the New Jersey Legislature) from 1976 to 1981 and in the New Jersey Senate from 1982 to 1984.

Saxton had been a resident of the Vincentown section of Southampton Township, New Jersey.

In 1984, 13th District Congressman Edwin B. Forsythe died with nine months left in his seventh full term. Saxton was elected as his successor. He ran in two elections which took place on the same day‚Äîa special election for the balance of Forsythe&#x27;s term, and a regular election for a full two-year term. This gave him greater seniority than other freshmen congressmen elected in 1984. He was reelected 11 times without serious difficulty, always winning at least 58 percent of the vote. His district was renumbered as the 3rd District after New Jersey lost a seat in the 1990 census.

He was a high-ranking member of the Armed Services Committee and the Resources Committee and Ranking Republican Member and Chairman of the Joint Economic Committee made up of members of the Senate and House of Representatives.

In 2000, Saxton was challenged by then Cherry Hill Mayor Susan Bass Levin, giving Saxton a spirited challenge for the first time in years though Saxton ultimately prevailed.

In the United States House elections, 2006, Saxton was challenged by Democrat Rich Sexton, a lawyer and U.S. Navy veteran from Mount Laurel. Saxton won reelection by a 58%‚Äì41% margin.

Saxton was widely praised across South Jersey for his efforts to remove Fort Dix from the Pentagon&#x27;s base realignment and closure lists in 1989 and 1991, McGuire Air Force Base from the list in 1993, and Lakehurst Naval Air Station from the list in 1995. From 1993 to 2005, he worked to foster joint military facilities at the three installations. Saxon&#x27;s efforts were rewarded when Congress passed and President Bush signed into law the Base Realignment and Closure, 2005. In addition to saving the bases&#x27; 17,000 jobs, the legislation merged the three bases, creating a &quot;megabase&quot; (the first of its kind in the United States). Furthermore, 1,500 jobs and additional aircraft were directed to the new joint base. Saxton also saved the New Jersey National Guard&#x27;s 108th Air Refueling Wing from oblivion by working to provide it with a squadron of newer planes.

His other accomplishments include a beach erosion repair project on popular tourist destination Long Beach Island (which saw a 2006 groundbreaking) and a hospital Medicare funding initiative that brought $80 million to New Jersey hospitals in 2005 and 2006.

On May 26, 2006, Saxton reported hearing a loud gunfire-type noise in the Rayburn House Office Building that led to the building being shut down for several hours. It was later determined that the noise was a construction worker discharging a pneumatic hammer in an elevator shaft near the garage. Capitol police officers who subsequently asked the workers to recreate the noise agreed it sounded like gunfire.

On November 9, 2007, Saxton announced that he would not seek reelection in 2008, citing prostate cancer. He was succeeded by Democratic state senator John Adler, who had been Saxton&#x27;s Democratic opponent in 1990.

Saxton has been a resident of Mount Holly, New Jersey.

==Committee assignments==
* Armed Services Committee
** Air and Land Forces Subcommittee (Ranking Member)
** Terrorism and Conventional Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee
* Natural Resources Committee
** Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife and Oceans
* Joint Economic Committee (Ranking Member; Chairman)

==Political positions==
Saxton has been classified as a moderate Republican. The American Conservative Union counts his lifetime score as similar to that of conservative Mississippi Democrat Gene Taylor. In 2006, the nonpartisan &quot;National Journal&quot; listed him as one of the Congress&#x27;s centrists. He supported taking action to ensure the long-term solvency of Social Security.

He argued against the estate tax in the Joint Economic Committee Study of 1998. This analysis examined the arguments for and against the federal estate tax and concluded that the estate tax generates costs to taxpayers, the economy and the environment which far exceeds any potential benefit that it might arguably produce.

He is conservative on abortion issues, which earned him a 100% rating by the Christian Coalition from 2003 to 2005. He has voted against bills that would authorize partial birth abortion, taxpayer-funded human embryo experimentation, and human cloning.

However, he supported liberal issues, such as gun control (Brady Bill and a ban on semi-automatic firearms). Saxton is supportive of environmentalism, which led him to be one of the few Republicans that the Sierra Club endorsed in 2000, 2002, 2004 and 2006. He has received generally favorable ratings by other environmental groups. He was endorsed by the League of Conservation Voters, Ocean Champions and the New Jersey Environmental Federation in his 2006 reelection bid. The Audubon Society, the National Wildlife Federation, and the Nature Conservancy have regularly given him high marks and various awards for his work on conservation issues. Saxton also co-founded the bi-partisan Congressional Wildlife Refuge Caucus.

<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Tsukasa Hojo. It was serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump&quot; from 1985 to 1991, with its chapters collected in 35 volumes. The manga was adapted into an anime television series by Sunrise Studios in 1987. The anime series was popular in numerous Asian and European countries.

&quot;City Hunter&quot; spawned a media franchise consisting of numerous adaptations and spin-offs from several countries. The franchise includes four anime television series, three anime television specials, three made-for-television animated films, two animated feature films for theatrical release (&quot;Shinjuku Private Eyes&quot; in February 2019 and &quot;Angel Dust&quot; in September 2023), several live-action films (including &quot;City Hunter&quot;, a Hong Kong film starring Jackie Chan, and &quot;Nicky Larson et le Parfum de Cupidon&quot;, a French film), video games, and a live-action Korean TV drama. It also had a spin-off manga, &quot;Angel Heart&quot;, which in turn spawned its own anime television series and a live-action Japanese TV drama.

==Plot==
The series follows the exploits of Ryo Saeba, a &quot;sweeper&quot; who is always found chasing beautiful girls and a private detective who works to rid Tokyo of crime, along with his associate or partner, Hideyuki Makimura. Their &quot;City Hunter&quot; business is an underground jack-of-all-trades operation, contacted by writing the letters &quot;XYZ&quot; on a communal at Shinjuku Station.

One day, Hideyuki is murdered, and Ryo must take care of Hideyuki&#x27;s sister, Kaori, a tomboy who becomes his new partner in the process. However, Kaori is very susceptible and jealous, often hitting Ryo with a giant hammer when he does something perverted. The story also follows the behind-the-scenes romance between Ryo and Kaori and the way they cooperate throughout each mission.

==Characters==
:
:Ryo is the main protagonist of the series. At the age of three, Ryo was the only survivor of a plane crash in Central America. He was raised as a guerilla fighter and has no knowledge of his prior identity. After the war, Ryo makes his way to the United States, before eventually moving to Tokyo.
:While in Tokyo, he forms the &quot;City Hunter&quot; team with Hideyuki Makimura, but after Hideyuki&#x27;s death, Kaori takes his place as Ryo&#x27;s new partner. A highly skilled gunman, Ryo is known for executing the &quot;one-hole shot&quot;, a series of shots that all land in exactly the same spot on the target. His preferred weapon is the Colt Python .357 Magnum.
:Ryo invented the nickname &quot;Umibozu&quot; for his fellow colleague Hayato Ijuin, and he answered giving Ryo his own, (an ironic name, because Ryo is a real pervert who tries to hit on any beautiful woman he meets or sees, failing every time). Ryo is an accomplished marksman with revolvers, semiautomatic guns, machine-pistols, rifles, carbines and crossbows; he knows hand-to-hand combat very well and drives as a real daredevil when needed; his car is a Mini.
:
:Kaori is Ryo Saeba&#x27;s partner. She is primarily responsible for arranging clients and other managerial tasks. Ryo&#x27;s skirt-chasing rouses her ire more than just once. Though the partners frequently pick on fights or arguments, they actually form a great team together. She might have been mistaken as a man sometimes due to her hairstyle. She is Hideyuki&#x27;s adoptive sister, her birth name being .
:
:Hideyuki is Kaori&#x27;s adopted older brother and Ryo&#x27;s partner at the beginning of the series. Kaori is not related to him by blood, his father had adopted her when she was a child. He is a former police detective with a strong sense of justice. Kaori become Ryo&#x27;s partner and takes over her brother&#x27;s role after he is murdered by gangsters. His last wish before he died was for Ryo to take care of his sister. His first name is not specified in the original manga, but when it was adapted into an anime, the official setting for his first name was established as &#x27;Hideyuki&#x27;, the same as the voice actor who voiced him.
:
:Umib≈çzu is another &quot;sweeper&quot; working the rounds in Tokyo. Umibozu is a Special Forces enemy of Ryo&#x27;s from the Central America conflict. Despite being on opposing forces, the two develop a friendship and mutual respect. Between his jobs, Umibozu works as waiter at the Cat&#x27;s Eye caf√©, owned by Miki, his former fellow soldier and lover. He goes by the professional name and his real name is ; the kanji &quot;haya&quot; in his name can also be read &quot;hayabusa&quot; (falcon in Japanese), hence his professional name; the nickname &quot;Umib≈çzu&quot; was given by Ryo. His favorite weapons are the S&amp;W M29 .44 Magnum six-inch revolver, the Saco-Defense M60 machine-gun (sometimes he uses the M249) and the M1A6 bazooka. Despite his fearsome appearance he has a phobia of kittens, he is very shy with women and much more unselfish than Ryo. His vision is very weak because a fight he had with Ryo in Central America, when Ryo was a guerrilla fighter and Umibozu was a mercenary; since then, Umibozu wants a duel with Ryo to close that story; during the series, he will go permanently blind and he&#x27;ll have to learn how to use the other four senses to move and fight; however, he decides to not retire before finishing their matter. Later Shin Kaibara, Ryo&#x27;s adoptive father and former guerrilla fighter who became a drug lord, comes in Japan; his drug was tested on Ryo during his youth, causing him to attack Umibozu and his unit; when Umibozu learns this from Bloody Mary, an old acquaintance of Ryo&#x27;s and daughter of the other Ryo&#x27;s fatherly figure in the jungle, he joins Ryo and Kaori against Kaibara. During the last story arc he marries Miki, but she is shot by enemy soldiers deployed by a new enemy of Ryo; Umibozu enters the firefight trusting Miki will not die.
:The Umib≈çzu is a &quot;yokai&quot; (spirit) from Japanese folklore; he is said to turn ships upside down if someone aboard talks to him; he is portrayed bald as a (Buddhist monk); the character &quot;umi&quot; means &#x27;sea&#x27;.
:
:Miki was a war orphan who Umibozu found in a completely destroyed village. Contrary to her habits, Umibozu decided to take her with him and teach her everything she knew so that she would one day be able to get by on her own. Only when Miki shows her intentions of joining the Umibozu guerrilla squad will she understand that she has radically changed her life, and feeling guilty will he try to make her a &quot;normal&quot; girl again by abandoning her, after making her believe that he would return to the civilized world with her. Miki, however, does not give up and after much research she manages to find her Falcon and make him accept a pact: if she manages to kill Ryo Saeba, Umibozu will agree to marry her. To do this Miki will become the owner of the Cat&#x27;s Eye, where Ryo will begin to go more and more often attracted by the beauty of the woman. In the end Miki does not kill Ryo, but thanks to Kaori&#x27;s complicity and that of Ryo himself, she is still able to have him next to her in the Cat&#x27;s Eye, until they get married. The Cat&#x27;s Eye becomes a staple of the anime and a favorite bar for the two sweepers, as that&#x27;s where they will always take their customers and give rise to the most spectacular fights.
:
:Saeko is a Tokyo police detective and Reika&#x27;s older sister who often outsources certain tasks to the City Hunter team. Ryo keeps a long and detailed list of what Saeko owes him for the various favours he has done for her, which she always manages to avoid paying.
:
:She is the private investigator of &quot;RN Detective Agency&quot;, the younger sister of Saeko Nogami and the neighbor of Ryo Saeba.
:
:She was one of Ryo Saeba&#x27;s clients after Ryo himself finds out that Kasumi is Phantom 305, a night thief in the making with similar motives as to the members of Cat&#x27;s Eye,
:
:He was a guerilla fighter fighting alongside Ryo Saeba and Bloody Mary&#x27;s father. Currently he is the leader of Union Teope, a drug syndicate.

<doc id="417534" wikidata="Q864014" url="?curid=417534" title="Algorism">
<text>Algorism is the technique of performing basic arithmetic by writing numbers in place value form and applying a set of memorized rules and facts to the digits. One who practices algorism is known as an algorist. This positional notation system has largely superseded earlier calculation systems that used a different set of symbols for each numerical magnitude, such as Roman numerals, and in some cases required a device such as an abacus.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;algorism&quot; comes from the name Al-KhwƒÅrizmƒ´ (c. 780‚Äì850), a Persian mathematician, astronomer, geographer and scholar in the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, whose name means &quot;the native of Khwarezm&quot;, which is now in modern-day Uzbekistan. He wrote a treatise in Arabic language in the 9th¬†century, which was translated into Latin in the 12th¬†century under the title &quot;Algoritmi de numero Indorum&quot;. This title means &quot;Algoritmi on the numbers of the Indians&quot;, where &quot;Algoritmi&quot; was the translator&#x27;s Latinization of Al-Khwarizmi&#x27;s name. Al-Khwarizmi was the most widely read mathematician in Europe in the late Middle Ages, primarily through his other book, the Algebra. In late medieval Latin, &quot;algorismus&quot;, the corruption of his name, simply meant the &quot;decimal number system&quot; that is still the meaning of modern English algorism. During the 17th¬†century, the French form for the word ‚Äì but not its meaning ‚Äì was changed to &quot;algorithm&quot;, following the model of the word &quot;logarithm&quot;, this form alluding to the ancient Greek . English adopted the French very soon afterwards, but it wasn&#x27;t until the late 19th¬†century that &quot;algorithm&quot; took on the meaning that it has in modern English. In English, it was first used about 1230 and then by Chaucer in 1391. Another early use of the word is from 1240, in a manual titled &quot;Carmen de Algorismo&quot; composed by Alexandre de Villedieu. It begins thus:

which translates as:
The word &quot;algorithm&quot; also derives from &quot;algorism&quot;, a generalization of the meaning to any set of rules specifying a computational procedure. Occasionally &quot;algorism&quot; is also used in this generalized meaning, especially in older texts.

==History==
Starting with the integer arithmetic developed in India using base 10 notation, Al-KhwƒÅrizmƒ´ along with other mathematicians in medieval Islam, documented new arithmetic methods and made many other contributions to decimal arithmetic (see the articles linked below). These included the concept of the decimal fractions as an extension of the notation, which in turn led to the notion of the decimal point. This system was popularized in Europe by Leonardo of Pisa, now known as Fibonacci.

<text>David John Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Turville (born 24 October 1940) is a British politician, businessman and philanthropist. From 1992 to 1997, he served as chairman of Sainsbury&#x27;s, the supermarket chain established by his great-grandfather John James Sainsbury in 1869.

He was made a life peer in 1997 as a member of the Labour Party, and was on a leave of absence from the House of Lords from 15 July 2013 to his retirement in 2021. He served in the government as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Science and Innovation from 1998 and 2006.

He is a major donor to the University of Cambridge and, in 2011, was elected Chancellor of the University of Cambridge. He also made the largest donation in British political history, giving ¬£8 million to the Liberal Democrats.

==Early life and business career==

The son of Sir Robert Sainsbury (1906‚Äì2000) and Lisa Ingeborg ( van den Bergh; 1912‚Äì2014), Sainsbury attended Eton College before going on to earn a degree in History and Psychology at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He then completed an MBA at Columbia Business School in the United States.

Sainsbury joined the family firm, then known as J. Sainsbury Ltd., in 1963, working in the personnel department. He became a director in 1966. He was Financial Controller from 1971 to 1973, just before the company&#x27;s flotation.

When the company listed on the London Stock Exchange on 12 July 1973, at the time the largest flotation ever, his family retained control with an 85% stake. His father, Sir Robert Sainsbury, gave almost his entire stake in the company to David Sainsbury, his only son, whereas his uncle Alan Sainsbury split his stake in the business between his sons John Davan Sainsbury, Simon Sainsbury, and Tim Sainsbury. John Davan Sainsbury became chairman in 1969 on Sir Robert Sainsbury&#x27;s retirement.

He was the group&#x27;s Finance Director from 1973 to 1990, during which time the company grew rapidly. He was chairman of Savacentre from 1984 to 1993, during which time the hypermarkets business grew slowly. He was deputy chairman from 1988 to 1992. On JD Sainsbury&#x27;s retirement as chairman and chief executive on 2 November 1992, David Sainsbury became chairman.

In 1996, Sainsbury&#x27;s announced its first drop in profits in 22 years, and the first of three profits warnings during his chairmanship was issued. Although there were senior management changes, which included David relinquishing the chief executive&#x27;s role to Dino Adriano and becoming non-executive chairman, there were no new directors or outsiders appointed to the senior management team. Profits fell the next year, but rose in 1998. At this point, David Sainsbury, who had wanted to step down at the end of 1997, made a surprise announcement of his retirement as chairman to pursue his long-held ambition to have a career in politics, after &quot;32 enjoyable and fulfilling years&quot; working for Sainsbury&#x27;s. Sainsbury&#x27;s share price increased on the day of this announcement.

On his retirement as chairman, to avoid any conflict of interest, David Sainsbury placed his then 23% stake in Sainsbury&#x27;s into a &quot;blind&quot; trust, to be administered by lawyer Judith Portrait. When David Sainsbury announced his intention to give away ¬£1 billion to charity in 2005, his 23% stake was sold down, eventually to 12.9% by early 2007. His beneficial holding became just 7.75% when he regained control of his shares in February 2007 following his decision to step down as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Science and Innovation in November 2006. During the private equity takeover bid in the first half of 2007, David indicated he was willing to let the Sainsbury&#x27;s board open its books for due diligence if someone offered him a price of 600 pence per share or more.

David Sainsbury retains a sizeable shareholding in his family&#x27;s supermarket chain (around 5.85%). To further his philanthropy interests, he placed 92million of his shares (representing 5.28% of the company&#x27;s share capital), into his investment vehicle, Innotech Advisers Ltd (which donates all its dividends to charity), meaning his beneficial stake is just 0.57% (lower than JD&#x27;s 1.6% beneficial interest). The Sainsbury family as a whole control approximately 15% of Sainsbury&#x27;s. In the Sunday Times Rich List 2008 his family fortune was estimated at ¬£1.3 billion.

==Political career==
Sainsbury joined the Labour Party in the 1960s, but was one of the 100 signatories of the &#x27;Limehouse Declaration&#x27; in an advertisement in &quot;The Guardian&quot; on 5 February 1981; he went on to be a member of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) formed by the authors of the Declaration. Following the 1983 election, he prompted the party to give more priority to recruiting members and finding a firm financial base; he was by far the biggest donor to the party, and a trustee, giving about ¬£750,000 between 1981 and 1987. His donations were typically earmarked to specific projects rather than general day-to-day operations.

Along with David Owen, Sainsbury opposed merging the SDP with the Liberal Party following the 1987 election, and provided office space for Owen to help him re-establish a separate political party, which was created in 1988. The &#x27;continuing&#x27; SDP was wound up in 1990, and Sainsbury changed allegiance back to the Labour Party, rejoining them in 1996. A year later, following the Labour Party&#x27;s election victory, he entered the House of Lords as a Labour peer, being created Baron Sainsbury of Turville, &quot;of Turville in the County of Buckinghamshire&quot;, on 3 October 1997.

Between 1996, the year he rejoined Labour, and 2006, when he stood down as a government minister, Sainsbury donated ¬£16 million to the Labour Party, usually in batches of ¬£1 million or ¬£2 million each year. He donated a further ¬£2 million on 7 September 2007, stating that he was impressed by Gordon Brown&#x27;s leadership and believed &quot;that Labour is the only party which is committed to delivering both social justice and economic prosperity&quot;. He gave another ¬£500,000 on 15 December 2008, making a total of ¬£18.5 million. He is associated with the Labour Friends of Israel.

In April 2006, it was reported Sainsbury &quot;faced a possible probe into an alleged breach of the ministerial code after admitting he had failed to disclose a ¬£2 million loan he had made to the Labour Party ‚Äì despite publicly stating that he had.&quot; He subsequently apologised for &quot;unintentionally&quot; misleading the public, blaming a mix-up between the ¬£2 million loan and a ¬£2 million donation he had made earlier.

In July 2006, he became the first government minister to be questioned by police in the &quot;Cash for Peerages&quot; inquiry. On 10 November 2006, he resigned as Science Minister, stating that he wanted to focus on business and charity work. He categorically denied that his resignation had anything to do with the &quot;Cash for Peerages&quot; affair, although this was contradicted by subsequent press reports attributed to &quot;Labour insiders&quot; which suggested that his resignation was indeed a direct consequence of the affair.

From July 1998 to November 2006, he held the office of Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Science and Innovation at the Department of Trade and Industry, serving in the House of Lords and accepting no salary.

Because of his importance to the Labour Party as a donor, contemporary press reports described him as &quot;unsackable&quot;. He has argued that there are &quot;far too many reshuffles&quot;, and that there were considerable benefits to his remaining in post for so long.

Sainsbury has also been associated with the Institute for Public Policy Research and Progress. Between 2001 and 2011 he provided ¬£2 million of funding for Progress. In 2009, he created the Institute for Government with ¬£15 million of funding through the Gatsby Charitable Foundation to help government and opposition politicians to prepare for political transitions and government. He donated ¬£390,000 to Progress and the Movement for Change between December 2011 and April 2013, while he was not on a UK electoral register, which is contrary to electoral law, leading to Progress and the Movement for Change being fined by the Electoral Commission.

Sainsbury funded the &quot;Remain&quot; side of the 2016 European Union membership referendum campaign, giving ¬£2,150,000 to the Labour and ¬£2,125,000 to the Liberal Democrats &quot;Remain&quot; campaigns.

After the 2017 general election, Sainsbury announced he would no longer provide financial backing to party political causes, but will donate to charitable causes. During 2016 he had donated ¬£260,000 to Progress in addition to backing &quot;Remain&quot; organisations. However, in late 2018 he donated ¬£25,000 to Scottish Conservatives MP Luke Graham.

During the 2019 United Kingdom general election campaign Sainsbury donated ¬£8 million to the Liberal Democrats, over half the party&#x27;s election funding, making its election donations larger than the Labour Party&#x27;s.

Sainsbury has been a long-time patron of the socialist society Scientists for Labour.

He ranked 14 out of 50 on the Top 50 Influential Lib Dems of 2020 list ‚Äì the only non-Lib Dem member to feature.

==Charitable works==
Sainsbury founded the Gatsby Charitable Foundation in 1967. In 1993, he donated ¬£200 million of Sainsbury&#x27;s shares to the Foundation&#x27;s assets. By 2009 the foundation had given ¬£660 million to a range of charitable causes. In 2009, he allocated a further ¬£465 million to the foundation, making him the first Briton to donate more than ¬£1 billion to charity. He set up the Sainsbury Management Fellowship scheme in 1987 to develop UK engineers into leaders in industry.

In 2003 Sainsbury was granted the Andrew Carnegie Medal for Philanthropy.

Sainsbury has donated ¬£127 million of the Gatsby Charitable Foundation&#x27;s money to the University of Cambridge in the last decade: he gave ¬£45 million to the Cambridge University Botanic Garden in 2005. In 2011, Cambridge&#x27;s Sainsbury Laboratory opened, paid for by an ¬£82 million donation from the Gatsby Foundation made in 2008. It was said by the &quot;Financial Times&quot; to be &quot;one of the biggest donations ever made to a British university ... surpassed only by a 2000 gift to the university by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.&quot;

In 2013, together with his wife Susie, he joined the Giving Pledge, the group started by Warren Buffett and Bill and Melinda Gates, pledging to donate half his fortune to charitable trusts during his lifetime.

==Chancellor of the University of Cambridge==
In 2011, Sainsbury was formally proposed by the Nominations Board of Cambridge University to succeed the Duke of Edinburgh as Chancellor of the University of Cambridge. If his election had not been contested by 17 June, he would have assumed office on 1 July. However, his nomination became the first in 163 years to be contested by another candidate when, on 29 May, local shopkeeper Abdul Arain stood in protest at a planning application for a Sainsbury&#x27;s Local branch in Cambridge&#x27;s Mill Road district, triggering a contest that would have to wait until an October ballot. Four days later, a group of Cambridge University alumni successfully drafted actor Brian Blessed as an alternative candidate. On 20 June, socialist barrister Michael Mansfield became the third candidate to oppose Sainsbury. An election took place on 14 and 15 October 2011 in which Sainsbury won with 52% of the votes (2893 votes out of 5558) on a 2.5% turnout and he was confirmed to the position on 16 October 2011.

On 2 February 2024, the university announced that Sainsbury had advised of his intention to step down later in the year from his role as Chancellor.

== Personal life ==
Sainsbury and his wife, Susan Carroll (n√©e Reid), a former teacher, have three daughters. Lady Sainsbury is a Trustee of the Royal Academy of Music. She was appointed DBE in the 2022 Birthday Honours, for &quot;services to the Arts,
particularly during Covid-19&quot;, described in the list as &quot;Philanthropist&quot;. The family live in the Manor of Turville in Turville, Buckinghamshire. The Manor once belonged to the abbey at St Albans, but was seized by the Crown in the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1547. The manor house has since been rebuilt as Turville Park, a fine stately home in the village.

Sainsbury&#x27;s elder sister was Mrs Elizabeth Clark (19 July 1938 ‚Äì 14 August 1977), and his younger sisters are Celia and Annabel. He is the nephew of Alan Sainsbury. His cousins have included Simon Sainsbury, Conservative peer John Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Preston Candover, KG, and former Conservative MP Sir Tim Sainsbury. His great-grandparents, John James Sainsbury and Mary Ann Staples, established a grocer&#x27;s at 173 Drury Lane in 1869 which became the British supermarket chain Sainsbury&#x27;s.

<text>King Edward&#x27;s School (KES) is an independent day school for boys in the British public school tradition, located in Edgbaston, Birmingham. Founded by King Edward VI in 1552, it is part of the Foundation of the Schools of King Edward VI. It is a member of the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference.

It shares its site and is twinned with King Edward VI High School for Girls (KEHS). While the two schools run separately, dramatic arts, societies, music and other events are often shared; the schools also share a couple of hockey pitches and several clubs. The shared area is called Winterbourne after the nearby Winterbourne Botanic Garden. Since September 2024, the two schools have shared a joint head teacher, styled Chief Master &amp; Principal.

Alumni of the school include two Nobel laureates, a Fields medallist, as well as J. R. R. Tolkien (author of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;), and Field Marshal William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim, British military commander in Burma during the Second World War.

==History==

===Origins and New Street site===
The School was formed by the Gild of the Holy Cross and received the royal charter of King Edward VI on 2 January 1552 together with ¬£20 per annum returned by the Crown for educational purposes. Five years earlier, in 1547, the Suppression of Religious Houses Act 1535, part of the wider Dissolution of the Monasteries, provided for the confiscation of all assets of religious guilds except an amount of land with an annual income of ¬£21 (two thirds of the original lands) if the guild supported a school. The Guild of the Holy Cross in Birmingham had no school, but persuaded the Earl of Northumberland (also the lord of the manor of Birmingham) to release the land for the creation of a school. The charter of the &quot;free Grammer Schole&quot; of King Edward VI was issued on 2 January 1552, and the school came into being in the former guild building on New Street. By the 1680s there were &quot;neer 200&quot; boys in the school and a Petty School (a feeder school) had been established by the foundation.

The affairs of the school in the early part of the 18th century were dominated by a quarrel between a governor and the headmaster, but this notwithstanding, a new Georgian-inspired building was built on the New Street site between 1731 and 1734. In the latter part of the 18th century four separate elementary schools and a girls&#x27; school were set up by the Foundation of the Schools of King Edward VI. The school remained relatively stagnant after this until Francis Jeune was appointed Headmaster in 1835. He erected a new building on the same site, in the Gothic Revival style of architecture. This was designed by Charles Barry, who employed Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin for aspects of the interior design, generally held to include Big School and, less certainly, the decorative battlements. (Barry, again employing Pugin, subsequently designed the present Palace of Westminster.) From within this new landmark building came several changes in the curriculum and ethos of the school. Sports became an important feature, through games afternoons, and the dominance of Classics was lessened by the introduction of mathematics and science.

===Edgbaston site and Second World War===

By 1936 the old building on New Street had become a fire risk, and soot from the nearby train station was also an issue. The school also did not have any nearby space for sports, and had to travel to the playing fields near the present-day school. As a result, plans were made by the Governors and the then Headmaster, Edwin Thirlwall England, to move to a new site at Edgbaston Park Road/Bristol Road, in Edgbaston, along with the girls&#x27; school. At the time this new site was in the countryside, along with the nearby university. 

Ironically, the temporary buildings erected on South Field of the new site in 1936 burnt down. The school was forced to move for a time to the University of Birmingham&#x27;s Great Hall and surrounding buildings until new temporary buildings could be erected. The move was complicated by the outbreak of the Second World War, and the subsequent evacuation of the pupils to Repton School for a short period.

October 1939 saw the requisition by the War Office of the temporary buildings and surrounding playing fields, and they were used by the British and US armies for the remainder of the war. This use included, from February 1945, the basing of the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion: the only all-female, all-Black US Army unit to be deployed overseas during the war. The 855 women of the battalion were sent to Birmingham to sort and redirect a huge backlog of mail for US service personnel in Europe. The women of &#x27;6888&#x27; (Six Triple Eight) lived and worked at King Edward&#x27;s for 3 months to sort and despatch over 17 million items of mail, processing approximately 65,000 pieces of mail per shift at a rate of 3 shifts per day. In May 2019, US Ambassador Woody Johnson presented a blue plaque to the school to commemorate the 6888th&#x27;s achievement; the plaque now features on the route of guided tours organised by the Black Heritage Walks Network. The temporary buildings were later converted into classrooms before being demolished in 1958.

===Expansion and recent history===
By 1940 enough of the new buildings designed by Holland W. Hobbiss had been built for the school to begin lessons. In 1945 the schools became direct grant grammar schools, which meant that the Governors had to relinquish some control over the running of the school. 

The schools were finally completed around 1948, although the 1950s saw a period of expansion under the Chief Master Ronald G. Lunt, appointed 1952, including the construction of a swimming pool and the building of a chapel from a specially salvaged portion of the upper corridor of the New Street building. In 1976 the two schools became, once again, independent schools, due to the termination of the Direct Grant scheme by the then Prime Minister Harold Wilson. The school remains independent and is still on the Edgbaston site.

In 2010 the school replaced A levels with the International Baccalaureate diploma.

In 2012, the Independent review of A-level and IB results, based on government-issued statistics, ranked King Edward&#x27;s School 9th in the UK, ahead of Westminster (17th), St Paul&#x27;s (22nd), Harrow (34th), Winchester (73rd) and Eton (80th).

King Edward&#x27;s School and King Edward&#x27;s High School for Girls are managed by the Independent Schools Governing Body. From September 2024 the schools will be led by a combined leadership team led by Kirsty Von Malais√© as Principal of KEHS and Chief Master of KES.

==School buildings==

===The chapel===

The chapel, a Grade II* listed building, was originally part of the upper corridor of the 1838 New Street school (built by Charles Barry). It was moved brick by brick to Edgbaston (1938‚Äì1940) by Holland W. Hobbiss, and renovated and rebuilt in the 1950s.

The Cinema Museum in London holds extensive film of the old school being demolished in February 1936.

===&quot;Sapientia&quot;===
The desk of the Chief Master, with &quot;Sapientia&quot; (wisdom) inscribed over it, survives from Barry&#x27;s New Street school, and is still in daily use in Big School. This too is generally thought to be the work of Pugin.

==House system==

King Edward&#x27;s has a house system, instigated in 1902 by the then Headmaster, Robert Cary Gilson. Originally, there were four houses, using the colours Blue, Green, Red and Yellow, but the houses were known simply by the name of the Housemaster at any one time (&quot;Mr Soandso&#x27;s House&quot;), involving a change of name whenever the Housemaster changed. In 1951 the number of Houses was enlarged to eight, and it was decided that they should have permanent names. Six were called after former Headmasters, and two after assistant masters (Rawdon Levett and C. H. Heath). The colours of each house are shown on this table, though that for Levett was formerly brown.

==Extracurricular activities==
School visits are a priority at KES with two compulsory residentials in Shells (year 7) and a one more in each of year 8 (Removes) and year 9 (Upper Middles).

There are four main sports at KES; rugby and hockey in the winter and athletics and cricket in the summer. Other sports played at KES include tennis and water polo. The water polo team has won the English Schools Under-19 Water Polo competition in 2002 and 2008, the latter win being accompanied by the Warwickshire Cup. Numerous players have been called to the City of Birmingham Youth Squad and English Schools Water Polo teams.

King Edward&#x27;s School has had a Combined Cadet Force (CCF) since 1907 (originally Officers Training Corps, then Junior Training Corps, 1940‚Äì48); it is a voluntary organisation. The CCF comprises: the Royal Navy section, the Army section, and the Royal Air Force section. The RN section is currently affiliated to HMS &quot;Daring&quot;, along with several other organisations in the Midlands.

==School songs==
There are two school songs:

*King Edward&#x27;s School Song
**Written by Alfred Hayes (1857‚Äì1936), an Old Edwardian; composed by A. Somervell and first sung by Jerome O&#x27;Neill in 1937.
**A rousing song, sung mainly at the end of term. The boys usually place particular emphasis on the final words of the first line of the chorus by always shouting &quot;SOME TO FAME!&quot; 
**Much is made of the fact that the school song is sung in English, as opposed to the Latin of Eton and Rugby.
**The song is composed of four verses, with the chorus sung after each one.
*The Quatercentenary Song
**Written in Latin by Roger Dunt (1900‚Äì63), senior classics master; composed by Willis Grant (1907‚Äì81), music master
**Sung at &quot;Founder&#x27;s Day&quot;, the annual commemoration in October of King Edward&#x27;s birthday, and at the school&#x27;s &quot;Speech Day&quot;. It is also sung at various other award ceremonies. An extra verse was written for the visit of Queen Elizabeth II on 3 November 1955 (replacing a visit planned for the quatercentenary year 1952 by King George VI).

==King Edward&#x27;s in modern literature==
In the mid-20th century the school produced two authors who used their time at school as the basis for autobiographical work:

David Rudkin&#x27;s TV film &quot;Penda&#x27;s Fen&quot; alludes frequently to aspects of school life in the early 1950s. This includes dwelling on the Chief Master&#x27;s rostrum &quot;Sapientia&quot; (see above) and the direct use of some personal surnames of staff and pupils from that period. Scenes involving the Combined Cadet Force, a central theme in the film, recreate the atmosphere of the school at that time. Rudkin (OE 1947‚Äì1954) has published ambivalent views of his time at the school.

Jonathan Coe&#x27;s novel &quot;The Rotters&#x27; Club&quot; was begun while he was at KES, and he said that the background detail of the school (renamed King William&#x27;s) and the Birmingham suburbs came from his own life.

The biographical drama film &quot;Tolkien&quot; (2019) deals with the early life of J. R. R. Tolkien, including his time at KES.

==Notable former pupils==

Former pupils of King Edward&#x27;s School, Birmingham are known as Old Edwardians (OEs). A number of pupils have achieved prominence across various academic and sporting fields as well as in public service. Alumni of the school include two Nobel laureates, a Fields medallist, and J. R. R. Tolkien, author of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit.&quot;

In Science, Sir Maurice Wilkins was awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. Most famous for discovering the structure of DNA, along with Watson and Crick, his research contributed to the scientific understanding of phosphorescence, isotope separation, optical microscopy and X-ray diffraction, and to the development of radar. Twenty years later, another pupil of the school, Sir John Vane shared the 1982 Nobel Prize for Medicine for &quot;discoveries concerning prostaglandins and related biologically active substances&quot;. Similarly, Richard Borcherds, was the winner of the Fields Medal (mathematical equivalent of the Nobel Prize). Finally, Harry Boot, physicist, was the co-developer of the cavity magnetron.

There have been a number of public service and military figures who were pupils at the school. Field Marshal William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim, was Commander of the successful Burma Campaign against the Japanese during the Second World War and later Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS). Similarly, Lieutenant Colonel John Augustus Conolly, won the Victoria Cross (VC) at the Siege of Sevastopol in the Crimean War, becoming the only winner of the VC from the school. Sir Colin Figures, was Head of MI6 and played a distinguished role during the Falklands War. Another alumnus, Enoch Powell, remains an influential albeit controversial figure in British politics, serving in various Ministerial positions between 1957 and 1968, when he was sacked by Conservative Party leader Edward Heath for his &quot;Rivers of Blood&quot; speech. The first Mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street CBE, also attended King Edward&#x27;s.

In business, Sir Paul Ruddock, a hedge fund manager who served as chairman of the Victoria and Albert Museum, chairman of the University of Oxford Endowment, and co-founder and CEO of Lansdowne Partners, an alternative investment management firm, was an alumnus of the school. Similarly, James Quincey, the current chairman and CEO of the Coca-Cola Company, is also a former pupil of the school. Other alumni include Tony Hall, Baron Hall of Birkenhead, former Director General of the BBC, and Peter Williams, co-founder and CEO of Jack Wills.

Within the Arts, Sir Edward Burne-Jones, 1st Baronet was one of the most pre-eminent artists of the Pre-Raphaelite movement. James Dover Grant CBE (known by his pen name Lee Child), is a British author who writes thriller novels, and is best known for his &quot;Jack Reacher&quot; novel series. Jonathan Coe based his novel &quot;The Rotters&#x27; Club&quot; (2001) on his time at the school.

A number of sporting figures were pupils of the school including Alan Smith, England Test cricketer (England, Warwickshire and Oxford University), first CEO of the Test and County Cricket Board (TCCB).

==Chief masters==
The head teacher was referred to as &quot;Head Master&quot; until 1952, when the newly appointed R. G. Lunt adopted the title &quot;Chief Master&quot;, the title that has been used ever since. In 2024, on the retirement of Katy Ricks, the position of Chief Master was combined with that of Principal of King Edward VI High School for Girls, Kirsty von Malais√© (Principal of KEHS since 2020) taking over the joint role.

<text>Michael Diamond Resnick (; March 5, 1942 ‚Äì January 9, 2020) was an American science fiction writer and editor. He won five Hugo awards and a Nebula award, and was the guest of honor at Chicon 7. He was the executive editor of the defunct magazine &quot;Jim Baen&#x27;s Universe,&quot; and the creator and editor of &quot;Galaxy&#x27;s Edge&quot; magazine.

==Biography==
Resnick was born in Chicago on March 5, 1942. He was a 1959 graduate of Highland Park High School in Highland Park, Illinois. He sold his first piece of writing in 1957, while still in high school. He attended the University of Chicago from 1959 to 1961 and met his future wife, Carol L. Cain, there. The couple began dating in mid-December 1960 and were engaged by the end of the month. They were married in 1961. 

In the 1960s and early 1970s, Resnick wrote over 200 erotic adult novels under various pseudonyms and edited three men&#x27;s magazines and seven tabloid newspapers. For over a decade he wrote a weekly column about horse racing and a monthly column about purebred collies, which he and his wife bred and showed. His wife was an uncredited collaborator on much of his science fiction and a co-author on two movie scripts they sold, based on his novels &quot;&quot; and &quot;The Widowmaker&quot;. His daughter Laura Resnick is a science fiction and fantasy author. 

Resnick lived in Cincinnati from 1976 until his death from cancer on January 9, 2020.

==Work and themes==
Two notable motifs are evident in much of Resnick&#x27;s science fiction work‚Äîhis love of fable and legend. The other main subject of his work is Africa, especially Kenya&#x27;s Kikuyu people, their history, traditions and culture and colonialism and its aftermath. He visited Kenya often and drew on his experiences there. Some of his science fiction stories are allegories of Kenyan history and politics; other stories are actually set in Africa or have African characters.

Resnick&#x27;s style is known for its humor. He enjoyed collaborating with other writers, especially on short stories. Through to 2014 he had collaborated with 52 different writers on short fiction, three on screenplays, and three on novels. Late in life, he began writing and selling a series of mystery novels as well, featuring detective Eli Paxton. He had also sold screenplays based on his novels to Miramax, Capella, and Jupiter 9, and often had multiple properties under option to Hollywood studios.

His work has been translated into: French, Italian, German, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, Bulgarian, Hungarian, Hebrew, Russian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Polish, Czech, Dutch, Latin, Swedish, Romanian, Finnish, Portuguese, Slovakian, Chinese, Catalan, Danish, Croatian, and Greek. Resnick&#x27;s papers are in the Special Collections Library of the University of South Florida in Tampa.

== Editing ==
Resnick worked as an editor for &quot;National Insider&quot; from 1966 to 1969, and also as editor-in-chief of National Features Syndicate from 1967 to 1968. He was a publisher and editor for Oligarch Press from 1969 onwards. From 1988 on Resnick edited over 40 fiction anthologies. He was an editorial consultant for BenBella Books from 2004 to 2006 and executive editor of &quot;Jim Baen&#x27;s Universe&quot; from 2007 through 2010. From 2011 he was the series&#x27; editor for The Stellar Guild series published by Phoenix Pick. The series pairs lesser-known science fiction and fantasy authors with best-selling veterans of the genre. Beginning in 2013, he was the editor of the bi-monthly magazine &quot;Galaxy&#x27;s Edge&quot;, published by Arc Manor, which reprints work by major names in the field along with new stories by new and lesser-known writers.

== Fandom ==
Resnick and his wife were participants in science fiction fandom from 1962. As of 2012 Resnick had been the guest of honor at some 42 science fiction conventions and toastmaster at a dozen others. Resnick&#x27;s wife created costumes in which she and Resnick appeared at five Worldcon masquerades in the 1970s, winning four out of five contests.

==Selected awards and honors==
In 2012 he was the guest of honor at Chicon 7, the 70th World Science Fiction Convention in Chicago.

<text>Baron Sainsbury was created in 1962 for Alan Sainsbury in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

There have been two other peers with the surname &quot;Sainsbury&quot; who included their surname as part of their titles; all are from the Sainsbury family, namesake of the supermarket chain Sainsbury&#x27;s.

The three peers, in order of when they received their title, are:

*Alan Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury, of Drury Lane in the Borough of Holborn (1902‚Äì1998) ‚Äî John James&#x27;s grandson (Labour from 1962 to 1981, SDP from 1981 to 1988, &#x27;continuing&#x27; SDP from 1988 to 1990, crossbencher from 1990 to 1998)
*John Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Preston Candover, of Preston Candover in the County of Hampshire (1927‚Äì2022) ‚Äî Alan&#x27;s eldest son (Conservative from 1989 to 2022)
*David Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Turville, of Turville in the County of Buckinghamshire (b. 1940) ‚Äî only son of Alan&#x27;s only brother Robert (Labour from 1997)

The original Sainsbury&#x27;s Supermarkets founder, John James Sainsbury, never officially received or held any Queen&#x27;s honours.

==Alan Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury==

The title &quot;Baron Sainsbury&quot; was created on 3 May 1962 for Alan Sainsbury, a member of the third generation of the supermarket Sainsbury family. He was the first member of the Sainsbury family to be raised to the peerage, and chose the territorial designation of Drury Lane in his title, as Sainsbury&#x27;s first shop was opened there in 1869. Alan Sainsbury initially took the Labour whip in the House of Lords, and died on 21 October 1998.

==John Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Preston Candover==

John Davan &quot;JD&quot; Sainsbury was the eldest son of Alan Sainsbury who was the first Lord Sainsbury. John, Lord Sainsbury was a member of the fourth generation of the Sainsbury family, who received his peerage on 31 July 1989 and chose the territorial designation of Preston Candover, where he lived. He took the Conservative whip in the House of Lords.

==David Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Turville==

David Sainsbury, also of the fourth generation, received his peerage on 3 October 1997, and chose the territorial designation of Turville, which is where he lives. He took the Labour whip in the House of Lords. David Sainsbury&#x27;s father is Alan Sainsbury&#x27;s brother Robert Sainsbury.

==Media usage of title==

&quot;Baron Sainsbury&quot; or &quot;Lord Sainsbury&quot; properly refers to the first alone. However, these days, when people refer to &quot;Lord Sainsbury&quot;, they usually refer to David, Lord Sainsbury of Turville (Labour) as opposed to his cousin John, Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover (Conservative). In The Sunday Times Rich List ratings, &quot;Lord Sainsbury&quot; in &quot;Lord Sainsbury and family&quot;, refers to Lord Sainsbury of Turville as he holds the largest family shareholding in the supermarket chain Sainsbury&#x27;s, and not Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover.

<text>The Church of God is a holiness Pentecostal body that descends from the Christian Union movement of Richard Spurling, A. J. Tomlinson and others. They consider themselves officially The Church of God, but also designate themselves as The Church of God (1957 Reformation) and The Church of God (Jerusalem Acres), which is the name of their headquarters.

==History==
The Church of God at Jerusalem Acres shares its early history with the Church of God of Prophecy. After A. J. Tomlinson formed the Church of Prophecy Markers Association in 1941, he appointed Grady R. Kent head over it in 1943. After Tomlinson&#x27;s death, his son Milton was appointed General Overseer, but Kent remained a forceful preacher and influential leader. In 1948, the Church of God of Prophecy adopted a resolution making the General Assembly the highest authority in the church. This helped set the stage for division. Some members within the church accepted the practice of theocratic government, with the Bishop or General Overseer ruling the church.

In 1957 Grady R. Kent went out of the Church of God of Prophecy and formed The Church of God, which adopted its name in 1958. The church was &quot;reorganized&quot; in Cherokee, North Carolina, on February 17, 1957. On August 1, 1958, a seven-acre (28,000¬†m2) tract of land was purchased in Cleveland, Tennessee, and the church undertook a project similar to the Fields of the Wood, which is owned by the Church of God of Prophecy. Great authority was placed in &quot;theocratic government&quot; and the Chief Bishop, who was responsible for ruling the church. Bishop Kent died on March 31, 1964, of cancer of the nose. He refused medical treatment for the cancer until just before death, preferring to rely on a prayer vigil conducted by a rotating team of his 12 Apostles. Several other Bishops have presided over the church since then, and in 1996, another split happened with Bishop John A Looper leaving the church after disagreements over doctrinal issues. Bishop Lavell Craig, as of March 2017, is the Presiding Bishop (they no longer use the term &quot;Chief Bishop&quot;). Under former Presiding Bishop Samuel Kramer&#x27;s leadership, the church has fully returned to a Sabbath-keeping service schedule which had largely been abandoned under Looper&#x27;s administration. The church has expanded and continues to grow in Haiti, Liberia, Zambia, Mexico, Argentina, Tanzania, India, and the Philippines.

==Faith and practice==
The faith and practice of The Church of God at Jerusalem Acres is similar to the related Church of God bodies, but with more of a &quot;Jewish&quot; flavor, which they call &quot;New Testament Judaism&quot;. Because the church believes that Judaism is God&#x27;s plan of worship, &quot;New Testament Judaism&quot; reflects the fact that Jesus came to reform Judaism, not to destroy it. In fact this body is often identified, and occasionally self-identified, as The Church of God (New Testament Judaism). This body teaches theocratic government and teaches that the whole Bible is the inspired word of God; salvation by accepting Jesus as Saviour; the seventh-day Sabbath; the nine gifts of the Spirit and five gifts of ministry; and the post-tribulational premillennial return of Jesus Christ. While the group accepts prophecy as ongoing today, they believe that modern prophets are fallible, and therefore modern prophecies are not considered equal with the Bible.

===Biblical feast days===
The Church of God at Jerusalem Acres does not celebrate traditional holidays which were introduced by the Roman Catholic Church, such as Christmas, Easter, and All Saints Day. Their church calendar is based on the Hebrew calendar. They observe or celebrate a number of days, some of which are peculiar to their denomination. For example:
* Reformation Day ‚Äì February 13, the day the church was reformed from apostasy. Reformation Day is a celebration of the day when The Church of God (Jerusalem Acres) we officially reorganized, following their split with the Church of God of Prophecy in 1957. It was at this point that Bishop Grady R. Kent made a stand for a concept called &quot;theocratic government&quot; that had previously been inherent in the doctrine of the Church of God of Prophecy. When the Church of God of Prophecy decided to transition to a form of government led by committee rather than an Anointed Leader, Bishop Kent took a stand for their Biblical tradition and was forced to resign. A fair number of churches followed with him and they became The Church of God (Jerusalem Acres).
* Passover ‚Äì 14th of Abib (Jewish month); the New Testament Passover includes the observance of the Memorial Supper and feet washing.
* Pentecost ‚Äì the feast of 50 days after the day of Wave Sheaf; the church celebrates this day &quot;in much the same manner in which the early church observed it in Acts 2...&quot; This is also the time of their General Assembly, in which members from their churches travel to Cleveland, Tennessee for a week-long gathering and special service schedule.
* Arise, Shine Day ‚Äì June 13, the day A. J. Tomlinson &quot;found&quot; the Church of God; (June 13, 1903)
* Feast of Tabernacles, which they recognize as the time of the birth of Jesus Christ, in the Jewish month, Tishri
The Church of God at Jerusalem Acres observes the seventh-day (Saturday) Sabbath, citing that the Bible states that this was the custom of both Jesus and Paul.

===Theocratic government===
Theocratic government is the system of governance used by The Church of God. In this system, the Church is led by an Anointed Leader, often referred to as the Presiding Bishop (Presently Bishop Lavell Craig), who is considered to be the &quot;good steward&quot; who is commanded to give the church their &quot;meat (or revelation) in due season&quot;. In addition to the Presiding Bishop, Church government consists of twelve modern Apostles, Seven Businessmen and Seventy-Two Prophets, who oversee the works of the other bishops and deacons of the Church. Ministers are all welcome to participate in the discussion and any voting during the annual Minister&#x27;s Council, but only ministers who have attained the level of Deacon or Bishop are allowed to present papers or subjects for discussion which may lead to a change in doctrine or procedure.

===Seven business auxiliaries===
The Church of God considers all of the business of the church to fall under one of seven categories for each of which they have a corresponding business auxiliary. These categories are considered to be the seven distinct workings of the Holy Spirit (or the Seven Spirits of God), which they give the names &quot;Love, Preservation, Marking, Teaching, Perfection, Publishing and Evangelism&quot;. The corresponding auxiliaries, in the same order, are &quot;World Missions Auxiliary, Church Preservation Endeavor, Church Marking Association, Bible Teaching Auxiliary, Church Perfection Auxiliary, Church Publishing Company and Church Evangelistic Auxiliary&quot;.

==Status==
As of 2013, The Church of God at Jerusalem Acres had 18 churches in the United States with many churches throughout Mexico, Cuba, Haiti, Dominican Republic, South America, Africa, India and the Philippines. They have an estimated membership of 35,000 worldwide, and developing contacts in Russia, Ukraine, and Canada. Headquarters are at Jerusalem Acres in Cleveland, Tennessee.

<text>John Davan Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Preston Candover (2 November 1927 ‚Äì 14 January 2022) was a British businessman and politician. He served as the President of Sainsbury&#x27;s, and sat in the House of Lords as a life peer and member of the Conservative Party.

==Early life==

He was the son of Alan Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury, and the nephew of Sir Robert Sainsbury. His younger brothers were Simon and Timothy, former Conservative Minister of Trade; David Sainsbury, former Labour Minister for Science, was a cousin. His great-grandparents, John James Sainsbury and Mary Ann Staples, established a grocer&#x27;s at 173 Drury Lane in 1869 which became the British supermarket chain Sainsbury&#x27;s. When working for Sainsbury&#x27;s he was sometimes referred to as &quot;Mr JD Sainsbury&quot;.

Sainsbury was Head Boy of Sandroyd School, before heading to Stowe School and then Worcester College, Oxford, where he studied History.

==Business career==

Lord Sainsbury joined Sainsbury&#x27;s in 1950 (the year the first self-service store opened in Croydon), working in the grocery department. The next year he became a buyer. He later became in charge of many other aspects of the business, including bacon buying in 1956. He became a director of the Company, then known as J. Sainsbury Ltd., in 1958, becoming Deputy chairman in 1967 following his father Alan Sainsbury&#x27;s retirement.

Lord Sainsbury took over from his uncle Sir Robert Sainsbury as chairman and chief executive in 1969. At the time, although Sainsbury&#x27;s had always been the largest UK grocery retailer by market share since 1922, Tesco&#x27;s profits were double those of Sainsbury&#x27;s, and Marks &amp; Spencer&#x27;s were nine times those of Sainsbury&#x27;s.

He led the company on to the London Stock Exchange on 12 July 1973, which was at the time the largest flotation ever. Dubbed &quot;The sale of the century&quot; by the press, his family at the time retained control with an 85% stake. Whilst his cousin, David Sainsbury, inherited his father Robert Sainsbury&#x27;s entire 18% shareholding, Lord Sainsbury had to split his father Alan Sainsbury&#x27;s 18% stake with his younger brothers The Hon. Simon Sainsbury and The Rt Hon. Sir Timothy Sainsbury, and so they held 6% each.

During his 23 years as chairman, Sainsbury&#x27;s replaced all its 82 counter service stores with modern supermarkets, and the number of UK grocery stores increased from 244 stores (including 162 self-service shops) to 313 supermarkets, whilst the average size of new supermarkets increased from to . The range of products increased from 4,000 (including 1,500 own brand products) to 16,000 (including 8,000 own brand products). He was said to personally taste own brand products himself to make sure he was satisfied with its quality control, and personally approved every own brand product packaging design himself before the official launch of each new own brand product. He was said to turn up unannounced at stores by helicopter to patrol the aisles and highlight deficiencies.

He led Sainsbury&#x27;s into the United States through the purchase of Shaw&#x27;s, a US supermarket chain, and started both the Homebase and Savacentre ventures. Shaw&#x27;s and Homebase have since been sold, whilst Savacentre has been re-branded under the core Sainsbury&#x27;s brand.

Between 1973 and 1992, the company&#x27;s market capitalisation increased from ¬£117m to ¬£8.115bn due to an increase in the share price from 9p to 464p (on 15 May 1992). Between 1969 and 1992 sales increased from ¬£166m to ¬£9.202bn and profit before tax increased from ¬£4.3m to ¬£628m. The Company also boasted the highest sales per square foot in the food retailing industry and the market share of the UK supermarket business increased from 2.5% to 10.4%. Sainsbury&#x27;s also overtook both Tesco and Marks &amp; Spencer (the latter shortly before his retirement on his 65th birthday on 2 November 1992) to become the UK&#x27;s largest and most successful supermarket chain. Following his retirement, his cousin and Labour supporter David Sainsbury (now Lord Sainsbury of Turville) became chairman. Tesco overtook Sainsbury&#x27;s to become the UK&#x27;s largest supermarket chain in 1995, and David Sainsbury stepped down as chairman in 1998 to pursue his long-held ambition to have a career in politics.

Although Lord Sainsbury retired, he was Life President of the retailer and continued to take an active interest in the business. He toured stores with then chief executive Mike Coupe as well as being the family member always attending J Sainsbury plc Annual General Meetings. He also served as a Joint President of the Sainsbury&#x27;s Veteran Association along with former Sainsbury&#x27;s CEO Dino Adriano.

He was also the family member with a large shareholding that was most reluctant to sell down his stake. During the sell down of the family stake between 2005 and 2008 from 35% to 15%, it was Lord Sainsbury who was the last major family shareholder to reduce his stake, in his case from 4% to 3.89%, the 0.11% sold having belonged to a non-beneficial trust held by him.

J Sainsbury plc was informed on 5 December 2006 by Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover that he no longer held a reportable interest in the Company following the transfer of shares within his family. As a result, his 3.89% shareholding in Sainsbury&#x27;s was no longer reportable.

During the takeover bids for Sainsbury&#x27;s during 2007, Lord Sainsbury used N M Rothschild &amp; Sons as his financial advisor and was said to be the major family shareholder most resistant to selling his stake. Indeed, during the private equity takeover bid during the first half of 2007, he was said to be refusing to sell his stake of just under 3% at any price.

As of August 2009, Lord Sainsbury continued to control just under 3% of the company. Although David Sainsbury controls the largest family shareholding of 5.85%, and Lord Sainsbury controlled just under 3%, the beneficial holding of David Sainsbury was only 0.57%, compared with 1.6% for JD Sainsbury. The Sainsbury family as a whole control approximately 15% of Sainsbury&#x27;s. In the Sunday Times Rich List 2013 his family fortune was estimated at ¬£1.97 billion.

He was a member of the Steering Committee of the Bilderberg Group.

==Charitable works==

In 1985 he and his two brothers provided funds to construct a new wing of the National Gallery, London, at a cost of around ¬£50¬†million, which opened in 1991 as the Sainsbury Wing. He disliked the addition of several internal false columns in the wing so much that he had a letter expressing their satisfaction at an anticipated eventual removal secretly encased in one of the columns; this letter was only uncovered in 2024 during the wing&#x27;s renovation.

With his wife, he also ran the Linbury Trust, which offers grants to various projects in the fields of the Arts, Education, Environment &amp; Heritage, Medical, Social Welfare and Developing Countries. One of the most notable projects funded by the Linbury Trust was the 1990s redevelopment of the Royal Opera House in London. The Linbury Studio Theatre in the building was named in recognition of the substantial contribution made by the trust.

In 1987, Lady Sainsbury founded the biennial Linbury Prize for Stage Design, which identifies and encourages talented newcomers to the field of theatre design; the Prize continues to be funded solely by the Linbury Trust.

In 1993, he joined with Lord Rothschild to set up the Butrint Foundation to record and conserve the archaeological site of Butrint in Albania.

In September 2010 he donated ¬£25m to the British Museum, which the BBC reported as the biggest gift to the arts in two decades.

==Personal life and death==
Sainsbury was married to the former ballerina Anya Linden. They had three children.

He was knighted in 1980 for services to the food retailing industry, and was made a life peer on 31 January 1989 with the title Baron Sainsbury of Preston Candover, of Preston Candover in the County of Hampshire. He became a Knight Companion of the Garter in 1992.

Sainsbury died on 14 January 2022, at the age of 94.

<text>Alan Michael Sugar, Baron Sugar (born 24 March 1947) is a British business magnate, media personality, author, politician, and political adviser. 

Sugar began what would later become his largest business venture, consumer electronics company Amstrad, in 1968. In 2007, he sold his remaining interest in the company in a deal to BSkyB for ¬£125 million. He was also the chairman and part-owner of Tottenham Hotspur Football Club from 1991 to 2001, selling his remaining stake in the club in 2007 as well, for ¬£25 million. He is the host and &quot;Boss&quot; for the BBC Television reality competition series &quot;The Apprentice&quot;, which has been broadcast every year, with the exception of 2020 and 2021, since 2005. He also assumed the role for &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice Australia&quot; for Australia&#x27;s Nine Network in 2021 and 2022.

Sugar was elevated to the House of Lords in 2009 as a Labour peer and was one of the party&#x27;s biggest donors, but left the party in 2015 and subsequently expressed support for the Conservative Party. According to the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Rich List, Sugar became a billionaire in 2015. In 2021, his fortune was estimated at ¬£1.21bn, ranking him as the 138th-richest person in the UK.

==Early life==
Alan Michael Sugar was born on 24 March 1947 in Hackney, East London, into a Jewish family. His father, Nathan, was a tailor in the garment industry of the East End. His maternal grandparents were born in Russia, and his paternal grandfather was born in Poland. Sugar&#x27;s paternal grandmother, Sarah Sugar, was born in London to Polish parents.

When Sugar was young, his family lived in a council flat. Because of his profuse, curly hair, he was nicknamed &quot;Mop head&quot;, a name that he still goes by in the present day. He attended Northwold Primary School and then Brooke House Secondary School in Upper Clapton, Hackney, and made extra money by working at a greengrocers. After leaving school at the age of 16, he worked briefly for the civil service as a statistician at the Ministry of Education.

==Amstrad==
In 1968, aged 21, Sugar set up Amstrad with ¬£100 of Post Office savings. He started off selling radio aerials for cars and other electrical goods out of a van which he had bought for ¬£50 and insured for ¬£8.

The name of the company was formed from his initials and the first four letters of the word &#x27;trading&#x27;: Alan Michael Sugar Trading. It began as a general importer/exporter and wholesale; by 1970 the first manufacturing venture was underway. He achieved lower production prices by using injection moulding plastics for hi-fi turntable covers, severely undercutting competitors who used vacuum-forming processes. In the mid 1970s manufacturing capacity was expanded to include the production of audio amplifiers, stereo cassette recording decks and AM/FM radio tuners. In most cases beating the competition on price.

In 1980, Amstrad was listed on the London Stock Exchange and during the 1980s Amstrad doubled its profit and market value every year. By 1984, recognising the opportunity of the home computer era, Amstrad launched an 8-bit machine, the Amstrad CPC 464. Although the CPC range were attractive machines, with CP/M-capability and a good BASIC interpreter, it had to compete with its arch-rivals, the more graphically complex Commodore 64 and the popular Sinclair ZX Spectrum, not to mention the highly sophisticated BBC Micro. Despite this, three million units were sold worldwide with a long production life of eight years. It inspired an East German version with Z80 clone processors. In 1985, Sugar had another major breakthrough with the launch of the Amstrad PCW 8256 word processor which retailed at over ¬£300, but was still considerably cheaper than rival machines (such as the Apple Macintosh Plus, which retailed at $2,599). In 1986, Amstrad bought the rights to the Sinclair computer product line and produced two more ZX Spectrum models in a similar style to their CPC machines. It also developed the PC1512, a PC compatible computer, which became quite popular in Europe and was the first in a line of Amstrad PCs.

In 1988, Stewart Alsop II called Sugar and Jack Tramiel &quot;the world&#x27;s two leading business-as-war entrepreneurs&quot;. The 1990s proved a difficult time for the company. The launch of a range of business PCs was marred by unreliable hard disks (supplied by Seagate), causing high levels of customer dissatisfaction and damaging Amstrad&#x27;s reputation in the personal computer market, from which it never recovered. Subsequently, Seagate was ordered to pay Amstrad $153 million in damages for lost revenue. This was later reduced by $22 million in an out of court settlement. In the early 1990s, Amstrad began to focus on portable computers rather than desktop computers. Also, in 1990, Amstrad entered the gaming market with the Amstrad GX4000, but it was a commercial failure, largely because there was only a poor selection of games available. Additionally, it was immediately superseded by the Japanese consoles: Mega Drive and Super NES, which both had a much more comprehensive selection of games. In 1993, Amstrad released the PenPad, a PDA, and bought into Betacom and Viglen in order to focus more on telecommunications rather than computers. Amstrad released the first of its combined telephony and e-mail devices, called the &quot;e-m@iler&quot;, followed by the &quot;e-m@ilerplus&quot; in 2002, neither of which sold in great volume.

On 31 July 2007, it was announced that broadcaster BSkyB had agreed to buy Amstrad for about ¬£125m. At the time of the takeover, Sugar commented that he wished to play a part in the business, saying: &quot;I turn 60 this year and I have had 40 years of hustling in the business, but now I have to start thinking about my team of loyal staff, many of whom have been with me for many years.&quot; On 2 July 2008 it was announced that Sugar was standing down from Amstrad as chairman, to focus on his other business interests.

==Tottenham Hotspur==
After a take-over battle with Robert Maxwell for ownership of Tottenham Hotspur, Sugar teamed up with the club&#x27;s manager Terry Venables and bought it in June 1991. Although his initial investment helped ease the financial troubles the club was suffering at the time, his treatment of Tottenham as a business venture and not a footballing one made him an unpopular figure among the Spurs fans. In Sugar&#x27;s nine years as chairman, Tottenham Hotspur did not finish in the top six in the league and won just one trophy, the 1999 League Cup.

After being sacked as the club&#x27;s chief executive by Sugar in 1993, Venables appealed to the high courts for reinstatement. A legal battle for the club took place over the summer, which Sugar won (see &quot;Re Tottenham Hotspur plc&quot; [1994] 1 BCLC 655). The decision to sack Venables angered many Tottenham fans, and Sugar later said, &quot;I felt as though I&#x27;d killed Bambi.&quot;

In 1992, Sugar was the only representative of the then &quot;big five&quot; (Arsenal, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur) who voted in favour of Sky&#x27;s bid for Premier League television rights. The other four voted in favour of ITV&#x27;s bid, as it had promised to show big five games more often. At the time of the vote, Sugar&#x27;s company Amstrad was developing satellite dishes for Sky, though Sugar had declared this prior to the vote. During negotiations, Sugar called Sky CEO Sam Chisholm and angrily ordered him to &quot;blow [ITV] out of the water&quot; with a much higher bid.

In 1994, Sugar financed the transfers of three players of the 1994 FIFA World Cup: Ilie Dumitrescu, Gica Popescu, and J√ºrgen Klinsmann, who in his first season in English football, was named FWA Footballer of the Year. Because Spurs had not qualified for European competition, Klinsmann decided to invoke an opt-out clause in his contract and left for Bayern Munich in the summer of 1995. Sugar appeared on television holding the last shirt Klinsmann wore for Spurs and said he would &quot;not wash his car with it&quot;. He referred to foreigners coming into the Premier League at high wages as &quot;Carlos Kickaballs&quot;. Klinsmann retaliated by calling Sugar &quot;a man without honour&quot;, and said:

Klinsmann re-signed for Tottenham on loan in December 1997.

In October 1998, former Tottenham striker Teddy Sheringham released his autobiography, in which he cited Sugar as the reason he left the club in 1997. He said that Sugar had accused him of feigning injury during a long spell on the sidelines during the 1993‚Äì94 season. He further stated that Sugar had refused to give him the five-year contract he wanted, as he had not believed Sheringham would still get into the Tottenham team when he was 36. Sheringham returned to Tottenham after his spell at Manchester United and continued to start for the first team until he was released in the summer of 2003, at age 37. Sheringham said that Sugar &quot;lacked ambition&quot; and was hypocritical. As an example, Sugar asked him for recommendations of players; when Sheringham suggested England midfielder Paul Ince, Sugar refused because he did not want to spend ¬£4 million on a player who would soon be 30. After Sheringham left Spurs, Sugar approved the signing of Les Ferdinand, aged 31, for a club record ¬£6 million, on higher wages than Sheringham had wanted.

Sugar appointed seven managers in his time at Spurs. The first was Peter Shreeves, who replaced Venables in 1991, followed by the dual management team of Doug Livermore and Ray Clemence in 1992, former Spurs midfielder Osvaldo Ardiles in 1993, and Gerry Francis in 1994. In 1997, Sugar surprised the footballing world by appointing the relatively unknown Swiss manager Christian Gross. Gross lasted nine months as Spurs finished in 14th place in 1998, and began the next season with just three points from their opening three games. Sugar next appointed George Graham, a former player and manager of bitter rivals Arsenal. Although Graham won Spurs&#x27; first trophy in eight years, fans never warmed to him, partly because of his Arsenal connection, and disliked the negative, defensive style of football which he had Spurs playing; fans believed it was not the &quot;Tottenham way&quot;.

In February 2001, after speculation and confirmation on 11 December 2000, Sugar sold his majority stake at Tottenham to leisure group ENIC, selling 27% of the club for ¬£22 million. In June 2007, he sold his 12% remaining shares to ENIC for ¬£25 million, ending his 16-year association with the club. He described his time at Tottenham as &quot;a waste of my life&quot;. Sugar later donated ¬£3 million from the proceeds of the sale of his interests in Tottenham Hotspur to the refurbishment of the Hackney Empire in his native East End of London.

==&quot;The Apprentice&quot;==
Sugar became the host of the BBC reality show &quot;The Apprentice&quot;, which has had one series broadcast each year from 2005, in the same role as Donald Trump in the US version. he fires at least one candidate each week until only one candidate is left. Until 2010, the winner was then employed in his company and since 2011 wins a partnership with Sugar, including his investment of ¬£250,000 to establish their own business.

As a condition for appearing in the third series, Sugar placed a requirement that the show be more business-oriented rather than just entertainment and that he should be portrayed in a less harsh light, to counter his somewhat belligerent reputation. He also expressed a desire that the calibre of the candidates should be higher than those who had appeared in the second series (who had come across as manifestly lacklustre) and that the motives of the candidates for participating are scrutinised more carefully, given that certain candidates in previous series had used their successful experience in the show as a springboard to advance their own careers (as occurred with Michelle Dewberry, the winner of the second series, who left Amstrad&#x27;s employment only eight months after taking up the job). In September 2013, Sugar lost his Employment tribunal counter-claim against Stella English, the 2010 winner of &quot;The Apprentice&quot;.

Sugar has criticised the US version of &quot;The Apprentice&quot; because &quot;they&#x27;ve made the fatal error of trying to change things just for the sake of it and it backfired.&quot;

===&quot;The Celebrity Apprentice Australia&quot;===
In September 2020, it was announced that Sugar will be the new CEO on &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice Australia&quot; on Australia&#x27;s Nine Network, replacing former CEO Mark Bouris.

===&quot;Young Apprentice&quot;===
&quot;Young Apprentice&quot; (&quot;Junior Apprentice&quot; in series 1) was a British reality television programme spin-off in which a group of twelve young people, aged 16 and 17, competed to win a ¬£25,000 prize from Sugar. The six-part series began on BBC One and BBC HD on 12 May 2010, and concluded on 10 June. It featured Nick Hewer and Karren Brady as Sugar&#x27;s advisors. Brady made her debut on &quot;Junior Apprentice&quot;; it aired before she appeared on the adult version. The programme concluded with Sugar awarding the prize fund to 17-year-old Arjun Rajyagor. Tim Ankers finished in second place.

The second series started in October 2011, and featured eight episodes and twelve contestants. The series was won by Zara Brownless, with James McCullough as runner-up.

Originally proposed in March 2008 and confirmed in June 2009, &quot;Junior Apprentice&quot; received mostly positive reviews from critics. Sugar&#x27;s role under Gordon Brown&#x27;s government sparked a debate over the BBC&#x27;s political impartiality regulations in the run-up to the UK 2010 election, resulting in both &quot;Junior Apprentice&quot; and the sixth regular edition of &quot;The Apprentice&quot; being delayed.

===Other television appearances===
In May 2008, Sugar made an appearance on &quot;An Audience Without Jeremy Beadle&quot; to pay tribute to Jeremy Beadle as they were close friends and both appeared on a celebrity special of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; in 2005.

In January 2009, Fiona Bruce presented a BBC Two documentary entitled &quot;The Real Sir Alan&quot;. Also in 2009, Sugar appeared in television advertisements for investment bank NS&amp;I and The Learning and Skills Council talking about apprenticeships.

In May 2011, he presented &quot;Lord Sugar Tackles Football&quot;, a documentary looking into the financial woes of English football.

In September 2012, Sugar appeared as himself in a cameo in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;The Power of Three&quot;. Sugar&#x27;s cameo was filmed on the set of &quot;The Apprentice&quot;.

In November 2012, he appeared as himself in a cameo in a special episode of &quot;EastEnders&quot; for &quot;Children in Need&quot;.

== Other ventures ==
===Amsair===
Amsair Executive Aviation was founded in 1993, and is run by Sugar&#x27;s son Daniel. As with Amstrad, the name Amsair is an acronym taken from the initials of Sugar&#x27;s name &quot;Alan Michael Sugar Air.&quot; Amsair operates a large Cessna fleet, and one Embraer Legacy 650 with the registration G-SUGA, offering business and executive jet charters.

===Amsprop===
Amsprop is a property investment firm owned by Sugar and is now controlled by his son Daniel.

Simon Ambrose, winner of the 2007 series of &quot;The Apprentice&quot;, started working for Amsprop Estates after the series finished. However, in April 2010, he was reported to be leaving to start his own venture.

===Viglen Ltd===
Sugar was the owner (and Chairman of the board) of Viglen Ltd, an IT services provider catering primarily to the education and public sector. He resigned his position on 1 July 2009. Following the sale of Amstrad PLC to BSkyB, Viglen was Sugar&#x27;s sole IT establishment until its sale to XMA in 2014.

===Amscreen===
Sugar is Chairman of Amscreen, a company run by his son Simon, specialising in selling advertising space on digital signage screens that it provides to retailers, medical centres and leisure venues. &quot;Apprentice&quot; winner Yasmina Siadatan worked there, selling into the NHS.

The screens use a Face detection system called OptimEyes to try to identify age and sex of its viewers.

In July 2008, Amscreen purchased Comtech M2M, which was founded in September 1992, originally specialising in communications product retailing. This was before entering the M2M market in 1999. On 29 August 2008, Comtech M2M officially changed names to Amscreen Limited.

===YouView===
On 7 March 2011, Sugar replaced Kip Meek on the board of the BBC initiated IPTV project known as YouView (formerly known as Project Canvas) which is also backed by ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 and broadband providers including BT and TalkTalk. Sugar was paid ¬£500,000 for chairing YouView for the year ending March 2012.

==Political involvement==
From 1997 until 2015, Sugar was a member of the Labour Party. In 2001, he was one of Labour&#x27;s top 50 donors, giving ¬£200,000 to its head office. In February 2009, the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; journalist Andrew Gilligan reported that Sugar had been approached to be the Labour candidate for Mayor of London in 2012. Sugar subsequently ridiculed the suggestion in an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;. During Prime Minister Gordon Brown&#x27;s cabinet reshuffle on 5 June 2009, the BBC reported that he would be given a life peerage and had been offered a job as the government&#x27;s &quot;Enterprise Champion&quot;. On 7 June 2009, Sugar sought to clarify the non-political nature of his appointment. He stated that he would not be joining the government, that the appointment was politically neutral, and that all he wanted to do was help businesses and entrepreneurs. On 20 July 2009, he was made Baron Sugar, &quot;of Clapton, in the London Borough of Hackney&quot;. He made his maiden speech in the House of Lords on 25 November 2009.

In 2011, Sugar donated a total of ¬£69,000 to Labour or to leader Ed Miliband&#x27;s office, but the following year he defied party rules to implore the public to not vote for its candidate for London Mayor, Ken Livingstone.

In August 2014, Sugar was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

According to the BBC in 2015, Sugar had donated ¬£163,827 to Labour since Ed Miliband had become leader in 2010, but on 11 May 2015, four days after the Conservative Party won that year&#x27;s general election, Sugar announced that he was leaving Labour. He issued a statement to say:

Before the 2016 London mayoral election, Sugar said that he is popular politically, and repeatedly urged the public to not vote for the eventual winner, Labour candidate Sadiq Khan.

In 2016, Sugar endorsed the &quot;Remain&quot; campaign for the referendum on membership of the European Union. 

In May 2017, Sugar endorsed the Conservative Party at that year&#x27;s general election. During a June 2017 radio interview with LBC&#x27;s Nick Ferrari, Sugar was asked about the general election result. He said, &quot;It&#x27;s very, very surprising. I think I&#x27;d join a lot of people when I say the Theresa May and Conservative campaign was very lacking in what they were going to offer the public.&quot; He added that Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn &quot;did a very good job wooing the young and educated people. I would add that those people who voted for him are quite bright and educated, but also not very experienced in life.&quot;

On 31 March 2018, after complaints from Labour politicians, Sugar deleted a tweet showing an edited image of Jeremy Corbyn in a car with Adolf Hitler. The incident occurred after Corbyn said the party &quot;must do better&quot; in resolving the party&#x27;s problems with antisemitism. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell had urged him to &quot;delete and disown&quot; the tweet. Sugar responded that he was &quot;not the originator&quot; and that &quot;there is no smoke without fire in Labour&quot;.

On 5 April 2018, Sugar published an ode critical of Jeremy Corbyn, and in December that year, he announced during a television interview that he would leave Britain if Corbyn became prime minister.

Sugar endorsed Boris Johnson during the 2019 Conservative Party leadership election, and endorsed the party in that year&#x27;s general election.

==Personal life==
Sugar has stated that he is an atheist, but remains proud of his Jewish heritage. He married Ann Simons, a former hairdresser, on 28 April 1968 at Great Portland Street, London. They have two sons, Daniel and Simon, and a daughter, Louise. The couple formerly lived mainly in Chigwell, Essex. 

Sugar owns a four-seat Cirrus SR22 aircraft and a 13-seat Embraer Legacy 650 jet. During an attempted landing in his Cirrus at the grass airfield City Airport Manchester on 5 July 2008, he overshot the runway after touchdown due to poor weather and wet field conditions. No injuries were sustained, although the plane was slightly damaged and consequently grounded.

In February 2009, it was reported that Sugar had initiated legal proceedings against &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper following a report that he had been named on a &quot;hit list&quot; of British Jews in response to Israel&#x27;s ongoing military operation in Gaza. The threats are alleged to have been made by Glen Jenvey, the source of the original story in &quot;The Sun&quot;, who posted to a Muslim website under a false identity. On 10 June 2020, he, a pilot since 1975, announced on Twitter that he was taking delivery of a new 2020 Cirrus SR22T single-engine aircraft from the United States where he owns a Florida home and multiple boats, including a refurbished one named &quot;Little Tub&quot; and a superyacht.

In 2015, Sugar had an estimated fortune of ¬£1.04 billion (¬£1.07-¬£1.137 billion as of 2025).

In December 2020, Sugar announced that both his brother and sister had died from COVID-19.

In the 2020s, Sugar relocated to Australia permanently as a tax exile to help mitigate his UK tax liability. The move backfired when his financial advisers failed to take account of 2010 tax reforms that apply to peers of the realm. As a result, Sugar wrote a cheque for ¬£186m payable to HMRC for tax owed on share dividends that he received from his company Amshold in 2021, amounting to ¬£390m.

In February 2022, 70-year-old Patrick Gomes was jailed for three years and six months for sending antisemitic death threats to Sugar, in response to his comments on antisemitism in the Labour Party.

==Honours==

Sugar was knighted in the 2000 New Year Honours &quot;for services to the Home Computer and Electronics Industry&quot;. He holds two honorary Doctorates of Science, awarded in 1988 by City University and in 2005 by Brunel University. He is a philanthropist for charities such as Jewish Care and Great Ormond Street Hospital, and donated ¬£200,000 to the British Labour Party in 2001. Sugar was created a life peer as Baron Sugar, &quot;of Clapton in the London Borough of Hackney&quot; on 20 July 2009. On 29 October 2015, Sugar was listed by UK-based company Richtopia at number 5 in the list of 100 Most Influential British Entrepreneurs. In 2017 he ranked number 1 in the &quot;Essex Power 100&quot; list and was named the most powerful person in Essex.

==Controversies==
===Sex discrimination law===
Sugar has been accused of having an &quot;outdated&quot; attitude towards women. Regarding the 1970s UK law which states that it is discriminatory and hence illegal for women to be asked at interview whether they plan to have children, Sugar is quoted as saying &quot;These laws are counter-productive for women, that&#x27;s the bottom line. You&#x27;re not allowed to ask, so it&#x27;s easy ‚Äì just don&#x27;t employ them. It will get harder to get a job as a woman.&quot;

===Tweets===
On 30 September 2013, Sugar tweeted a picture of Chinese child crying &#x27;because he was told off for leaving production line of iPhone 5&#x27;. The message was investigated by the Merseyside police force&#x27;s specialist hate crime investigation team, who decided that it should be classed as a &quot;hate incident&quot; although no crime had taken place.

On 20 June 2018, he tweeted a picture of the Senegal national football team edited next to images of fake handbags and sunglasses, claiming that some of the players looked just like hawkers he had encountered in Marbella. He later defended his tweet as a joke before taking it down, after accusations of racism.

<doc id="417566" wikidata="Q862052" url="?curid=417566" title="Bill Davis">
<text>William Grenville Davis, (July 30, 1929 ‚Äì August 8, 2021) was a Canadian politician who served as the 18th premier of Ontario from 1971 to 1985. Behind Oliver Mowat, Davis was the second-longest serving premier of Ontario.

Born in Toronto, Davis was a lawyer before being elected as a Progressive Conservative member of provincial Parliament for Peel in the 1959 provincial election. He was a backbencher in the Conservative caucus until 1962, when he was appointed minister of education under John Robarts. During this period, Davis created the community college system and the educational television network now known as TVO.

In 1971, he succeeded Robarts as the premier of Ontario and held the position until resigning in 1985. He led the Progressive Conservatives to victory in four consecutive elections, winning two majority governments and two minority governments. As premier, Davis was responsible for the cancellation of the Spadina Expressway, the funding of Catholic secondary schools through grade 12, the formation of Canada&#x27;s first Ministry of the Environment, and rent control, as well as playing a large role in the patriation of the Constitution of Canada.

==Early life and education==
Davis was born on July 30, 1929, at Toronto General Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, the son of Vera Mildred ( Hewetson) and Albert Grenville Davis. His father was a successful local lawyer. Davis married twice, first to Helen McPhee (1931-1962) in 1955, with whom he had four children (Neil, Nancy, Cathy, Ian). He then married Kathleen Mackay (1933-2025) in 1964; they had one daughter, Meg, in 1965.

Davis was politically active from the age of 15. Local Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) Gordon Graydon was a frequent guest at Davis&#x27;s parents&#x27; house, and Davis himself became the first delegate younger than seventeen years to attend a national Progressive Conservative convention in Canada. He frequently campaigned for local Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) Thomas Laird Kennedy, who briefly served as Premier of Ontario in 1949.

Davis graduated from the University of Toronto with a BA in 1951. He was a football player during his university years, and his teammates included Roy McMurtry and Thomas Leonard Wells, both of whom would later serve in his cabinet. Davis received a bachelor of laws from Osgoode Hall Law School in 1954 and was called to the bar of Ontario in 1955.

==Early political career==
Davis was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the 1959 provincial election, for the southern Ontario constituency of Peel. He was only 29 years old. Although Peel was an extremely safe Conservative seat for most of its history, Davis won by a narrow 1,203 votes. The election took place soon after the federal Progressive Conservative government of John Diefenbaker had cancelled the Avro Arrow program. Davis was given the honour of move the motion to vote on the Speech from the Throne, which while purely symbolic, allowed him to give a speech that included two of his own planned projects: establishing what would become the Forks of the Credit Provincial Park, and improving education. Davis served for two years as a backbench supporter of Leslie Frost&#x27;s government. When Frost announced his retirement in 1961, Davis became the chief organizer of Robert Macaulay&#x27;s campaign to succeed him as premier and party leader. Macaulay was eliminated on the next-to-last ballot, and, with Davis, delivered crucial support for John Robarts to defeat Kelso Roberts on the final vote.

==Minister of Education==

Davis was appointed to Robarts&#x27; cabinet as Minister of Education on October 25, 1962, and was re-elected by a greatly increased margin in the 1963 provincial election. He was given additional responsibilities as Ontario&#x27;s Minister of University Affairs on May 14, 1964, and held both portfolios until 1971. He significantly increased education funding during the 1960s; spending increased by 454% between 1962 and 1971 and hundreds of public schools were opened. Davis also oversaw a controversial overhaul and amalgamation of the outdated school board systems in the province, reducing the number of boards from 3,676 in 1962 to 192 by 1967.

During his tenure as education minister, Davis established new public universities, including Trent University and Brock University, as well as the public community college system. Canada&#x27;s first educational research institute, the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, and the Ontario Educational Communications Authority educational television network (now TVO) were established while he was Minister, in 1965 and 1970, respectively.

Davis&#x27;s handling of the education portfolio, of which Robarts was a previous minister, made his entry into the leadership contest to succeed Robarts unsurprising. Robarts himself fully expected Davis to be his successor. He was immediately dubbed the frontrunner when he announced his bid on December 20, 1970. In the early hours of February 13, 1971, Davis defeated rival candidate Allan Lawrence by only 44 votes on the final ballot, after receiving support from third-place candidate Darcy McKeough. Following the convention, Davis brought Lawrence&#x27;s campaign team, known as &quot;the Spades&quot;, to become his principal advisors. The group later became known as the Big Blue Machine, and remained a dominant campaign force in the Progressive Conservative Party into the 1980s.

===Cabinet posts===

==Premier of Ontario (1971‚Äì1985)==
===First majority (1971‚Äì1975)===
Three months after taking office as premier, Davis announced that his government would not continue to fund construction of the Spadina Expressway into downtown Toronto‚Äîan initiative that had been unpopular with many of the area&#x27;s residents.
The section of Allen Road south of Lawrence Avenue was subsequently nicknamed the &quot;Davis ditch&quot;.
In July 1971, he created appointed the first Minister of the Environment, George Kerr.
On August 31, Davis announced the rejection of a proposal to grant full funding to Ontario&#x27;s Catholic high schools‚Äîwhich were only publicly funded up to grade 10‚Äîstating that it &quot;would fragment the present system beyond recognition and repair&quot;.

The campaign to elect the 29th Legislative Assembly of Ontario began two weeks later on September 13. The campaign featured the first televised leaders debate for a provincial election. The PC&#x27;s would gain 9 seats in the election, held on October 21, 1971.

Davis&#x27;s first full term as premier was by most accounts his least successful, with public confidence in his government weakened by a series of scandals. There were allegations that the Fidinam company had received special consideration for a Toronto development program in return for donations to the Progressive Conservative Party. In 1973, it was revealed that Davis&#x27;s friend Gerhard Moog had received a untendered C$44.4 million ($ in dollars) contract for the construction of Ontario Hydro&#x27;s new head office and related projects. Attorney General Dalton Bales, Solicitor General John Yaremko and Treasurer McKeough were all accused of conflicts-of-interest relating to government approval for developments on properties they owned. The government was cleared of impropriety in all cases, but its popular support nonetheless declined. The Conservatives lost four key by-elections in 1973 and 1974.

On the policy front, the Davis administration introduced regional governments for Durham, Hamilton-Wentworth, Haldimand-Norfolk, and Waterloo but shelved further plans in response to popular protests. He faced a significant backlash from teachers in December 1973, following the tabling of a bill to force an end to labour disruptions. In the buildup to the 1975 provincial election, Davis imposed a ninety-day freeze on energy prices, temporarily reduced the provincial sales tax from 7% to 5%, and announced rent controls for the province.

===Minority governments (1975‚Äì1981)===
The 1975 campaign was far more bitter than that of 1971, with Davis and Liberal leader Robert Nixon repeatedly hurling personal insults at one another. Polls taken shortly before the election had the Liberals in the lead. The Progressive Conservatives won only 51 seats out of 125, but were able to remain in power with a minority government. The New Democratic Party (NDP) won 38 seats under the leadership of Stephen Lewis, while Nixon&#x27;s Liberals finished third with 36. Soon after the election, Davis hired Hugh Segal as his legislative secretary. On January 1, 1976, Davis enacted Canada&#x27;s first mandatory seat belt law, following the death of the daughter of his close friend and advisor, Eddie Goodman.

Davis called a snap election in 1977, attempting to capitalise on the turmoil and surprise following the 1976 Quebec general election that saw the Parti Quebecois gain a majority. He was again returned with only a minority following the vote on June 9. The Progressive Conservatives increased their standing by 7 to 58 seats, against 34 for the Liberals and 33 for the NDP.
The Conservatives remained the dominant party after the 1975 and 1977 elections due to the inability of either the New Democrats and the Liberals to become the clear alternative. The Conservatives were able to stay in power due to the competition between both opposition parties. As there was no serious consideration of a Liberal-NDP alliance after both campaigns, Davis was able to avoid defeat in the legislature by appealing to other parties for support on particular initiatives. The opposition parties had also undergone leadership changes; Nixon and Lewis, who had posed a strong challenge to Davis, resigned after the 1975 and 1977 elections, respectively. Nixon&#x27;s successor Stuart Lyon Smith proved unable to increase Liberal support, while new NDP leader Michael Cassidy lacked the support of the party establishment.

This period of the Davis government was one of expansion for the province&#x27;s public health and education systems, and Davis held a particular interest in ensuring that the province&#x27;s community colleges remained productive. The government also expanded the provisions of the Ontario &quot;Human Rights Code&quot;,
and expanded bilingual services without introducing official bilingualism to the province.

Although he actively supported and campaigned for him in 1976, Davis had an awkward relationship with federal Progressive Conservative leader Joe Clark. He and Clark held differing views over fuel prices, and the Davis government actively opposed Clark&#x27;s 1979 austerity budget which included a gas tax.

===Second majority (1981‚Äì1985)===
The Progressive Conservatives were returned with a majority government in the 1981 provincial election, with 8 of their 12 gained seats coming at the expense of the NDP. Soon after the election, Davis announced that John Tory (who became leader of the PCs 23 years later) had been hired to succeed Hugh Segal as his principal secretary. He also announced that Ontario would purchase a 25% share in the energy corporation Suncor, despite opposition from within his own caucus.

Unlike most provincial premiers in Canada, Davis strongly supported Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s 1981 plans to patriate the constitution of Canada from the United Kingdom and add to it the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;. Davis&#x27;s role in the constitutional negotiations of 1981 were pivotal in achieving a compromise that resulted in the passage of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;.
Davis publicly announced his retirement on October 8, 1984, a few months before the 1985 election, with he and his government still well ahead in polls against David Peterson&#x27;s Liberals and Bob Rae&#x27;s NDP. One of his last major acts as premier was to reverse his 1971 decision against the full funding of Catholic schools, and announce that such funding would be provided to the end of Grade Thirteen. Although the policy was supported by all parties in the legislature, it was unpopular with some in the Conservatives&#x27; traditional rural Protestant base, and many would stay home in the upcoming election because of this issue.

Davis was succeeded by Frank Miller, who was elected leader at a January 1985 leadership convention over Larry Grossman (who was widely considered the successor to Davis and his Big Blue Machine). Although Miller was more conservative, the Progressive Conservatives still held a significant lead over the opposition when the election was called. However, after a poor campaign and controversy over Catholic school funding, in the 1985 provincial election they were reduced to a minority government and lost the popular vote to the Liberal Party, and were soon defeated in a motion of non-confidence by a Liberal‚ÄìNDP accord, ending the party&#x27;s 42-year period of rule over the province.

==Post-political career==

Davis was made a companion of the Order of Canada in 1986,
and received the Order of Ontario in 1987. Upon his retirement from politics, he served on numerous corporate boards, including Seagram, Power Corporation, CIBC, Rogers Cable among others. In 1985 and 1986, Davis was the Canadian half of a joint task force with the United States (with Drew Lewis as his American counterpart) appointed by Brian Mulroney and Ronald Reagan to solve the ongoing acid rain issues affecting the Great Lakes. Their report was popularly referred to as the Acid Rain Treaty; Davis was paid $1 for his work, proudly framing the bill at his cottage.

Davis&#x27;s reputation within the Ontario Progressive Conservatives was compromised during the 1990s by the party&#x27;s shift to the right under Mike Harris. Many Conservatives parliamentarians were openly dismissive of Davis-era spending policies, and frequently highlighted the differences between Davis and Harris on policy issues. Davis remained a supporter of the party, but seldom appeared at official events.

In 2003, Davis played a role in the successful negotiations to merge the federal Progressive Conservatives with the Canadian Alliance, and create the new Conservative Party of Canada. In the 2006 federal campaign, he campaigned for Conservative Leader Stephen Harper. Harper spoke favourably of Davis during the campaign, and said that he learned much from Davis&#x27;s style of governing. The Conservatives were able to defeat the Liberals to form the government.

In the early 2000s, Davis returned to an honoured position within the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party. He was a keynote speaker at the 2004 Progressive Conservative leadership convention, and was singled out for praise in speeches by outgoing party leader Ernie Eves and new leader John Tory. Davis was also present for Tory&#x27;s first session in the Ontario legislature, following the latter&#x27;s victory in a 2005 by-election.
In 2014, Davis endorsed Christine Elliott in her second campaign to become leader of the Ontario PC Party, but she finished as runner-up to Patrick Brown,
whom he would later endorse in his successful campaign against incumbent Linda Jeffrey for mayor of Brampton in 2018.

Davis had supported Jeffrey in her 2014 bid for mayor, as well as Toronto mayor John Tory, former Ontario PC Party leader and a principal secretary of Davis in the 1980s.
Incumbent Brampton mayor Susan Fennell was embroiled in numerous scandals over expenses and financial record-keeping. Davis reportedly convinced Jeffrey to resign from provincial cabinet to challenge Fennell. After taking office as mayor, Jeffrey appointed Davis to a panel tasked with bringing a university to Brampton. However, Davis and Jeffrey had a falling out over Peel Region&#x27;s proposed Light Rail Transit line, as Jeffrey supported its extension from Hurontario Street in Mississauga further north along Main Street in Brampton (where it would run by Davis&#x27;s house), while Davis preferred an alternative alignment along Queen Street.

Throughout his political career, Davis often remarked upon the lasting influence of his hometown of Brampton, leading to his nickname, &quot;Brampton Billy&quot;.

==Death==
On August 8, 2021, Davis died in Brampton at the age of 92.

In a 2012 edition, the Institute for Research on Public Policy&#x27;s magazine, &quot;Policy Options&quot;, named Davis the second-best Canadian premier of the last forty years, beaten only by Peter Lougheed.

==Recognition==
* In 1987, Davis was made an Honorary Senior Fellow of Renison University College, located in Waterloo, Ontario.
* Davis was appointed as a Companion of the Order of Canada in 1986, received the Order of Ontario in 1987, and was appointed as a Knight in the Legion of Honour of France in 2001.
* On October 24, 2006, Davis received Seneca College&#x27;s first Honorary degree and was presented with an Honorary Bachelor of Applied Studies. &quot;It is fitting that Bill Davis receives Seneca&#x27;s first honorary degree&quot;, said Dr. Rick Miner, President of Seneca College. &quot;As one of the architects of the college system in Ontario, he is responsible for a dynamic post-secondary education environment which continues to be a pillar of our province&#x27;s economy.&quot;
*The Public Policy Forum honoured Bill Davis with the Testimonial Award for his contribution to public life, public policy and governance in Canada at their 2011 Testimonial Dinner.

<text>Transportes A√©reos del Continente Americano, S.A. (Spanish for &quot;Air Transports of the American Continent&quot;), known and formerly branded as TACA International Airlines), and operating as Avianca El Salvador, is an airline owned by Kingsland Holdings and based in San Salvador, El Salvador. It is one of the seven national branded airlines in the Avianca Group of Latin American airlines, and it serves as the flag carrier of El Salvador.

Founded in 1931, the airline owned and operated five other airlines in Central America. Its name was originally an acronym meaning Central American Air Transports () but was later changed to Air Transport of the American Continent () to reflect its expansion to North, Central, and South America.

On 7 October 2009, the airline announced that it would merge with the Colombian airline Avianca, however, it maintained the TACA name until the merger was officially completed on 21 May 2013. TACA is the second-oldest continuously operating airline brand in Central America and the Caribbean, after Cubana de Aviaci√≥n.

==History==
=== Inauguration (1931‚Äì1980) ===


TACA International Airlines, then named Central American Air Transports, was founded in 1931 in Honduras by New Zealander Royal Flying Corps veteran Lowell Yerex. Initially, the airline only transported cargo, but beginning in 1940 the airline began passenger services. TACA began operations with a single-engine Stinson plane. Since its beginnings, routes covered all the national territory and its aircraft sported the XH Mexican registration (which was changed later by HR). Yerex planned to establish one airline in each Latin-American country, such as Aerovias Brasil in Brazil and other TACAs in Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia. Of all the TACA franchise airlines created, only TACA International of El Salvador survived.

In 1945, Yerex left the company and TACA moved its headquarters to the Republic of El Salvador where it was modernized and expanded. The company then established investment groups in other Latin American countries to be sold to domestic airlines, which in the case of TACA Honduras was sold to SAHSA. Later, TACA was organized as an international company having its headquarters in San Salvador operating under the name of TACA International.

During the 1940s and 1950s, the airline began to acquire larger piston-engine airliners including the Douglas DC-3 and the Douglas DC-4. The Vickers Viscount turboprop passenger airliner followed in order to expand its route network around the Americas.

On 28 December 1966, TACA International entered the jet age when it inaugurated its first jet, a BAC One Eleven. This aircraft model was used until 1 June 1988, when it was phased out in favor of the Boeing 737-200. The Lockheed L-188 Electra four-engine turboprop airliner was operated from 1976 by &quot;TACA Air Cargo&quot; including freight flights to Miami, Florida.

===Expansion years (1980‚Äì2009)===
Until 1980, TACA was owned by a United States company and had its corporate headquarters in New Orleans (due to the civil war raging in El Salvador) under the administration of the Kriete Family of El Salvador, who owned a minority stock and ended up buying all the shares.

According to the July 1983 TACA route map, the air carrier was operating jet service to four destinations in the U.S. from Central America (including Houston, Los Angeles, Miami and New Orleans). The airline also made several upgrades to its fleet during the 1980s by replacing the older turboprops as well as BAC One Eleven jetliners with more efficient aircraft, such as the Boeing 737-200 Advanced and 737-300 with the latter type being a member of the Boeing 737 Classic series. TACA later operated wide body Boeing 767s on its scheduled passenger services including international flights to Los Angeles and Miami.

Between 1990 and 1995, TACA bought the majority shares of the flag carrier airlines; Aviateca, LACSA, and Nicarag√ºense de Aviaci√≥n, consolidating operations under a new brand group name, Grupo TACA.

In the 1990s, TACA International became the launch customer and principal user of Latin America&#x27;s Airbus A320. These aircraft were substituting for the aging Boeing 737-200 and the 737-300/-400 series aircraft that were in the fleet, which were gradually retired until 1999.

In 1992, TACA signed a strategic alliance with Panama-based Copa Airlines, and the airline began flying to Tocumen International Airport, making it the first flight connection center in Latin America. As a consequence, Tocumen airport
became the &quot;Hub of the Americas&quot; and the integration of several Latin American airlines into the alliance took place. The alliance ended in 1998 after the six-year period established in the agreement expired.

On 9 August 1995, Aviateca Flight 901 crashed into the San Vicente volcano while on approach to Comalapa International Airport killing all 65 people onboard the aircraft. The Salvadoran Civil Aviation Authority determined that the accident&#x27;s probable cause was the flight crew&#x27;s &quot;lack of situational awareness in relation to the 7,159 foot obstruction [the San Vicente volcano]&quot; and that the airline&#x27;s crew resource management program was ineffective. As TACA International Airlines was Aviateca&#x27;s parent company, both airlines faced lawsuits from 21 families of crash victims, however, all the lawsuits were settled out of court.

Then in 2001, having its main hubs in San Salvador and San Jose, the airline set an operations base in Lima, Peru, its first base in South America, causing as a consequence the founding of TACA Per√∫, of which TACA had 49% shares at. With this new addition, Grupo TACA began to offer a comprehensive network of routes throughout the Americas.

In 2005, TACA was one of the founding members of the Mexican airline Volaris. In the same year, TACA became the first airline in Latin America to operate the Airbus A321.

In 2008, the board of directors decided to revert to the original name, &quot;TACA International&quot; (since the consolidation of the acquired airlines was completed), and the airline&#x27;s headquarters returned to San Salvador, El Salvador to a new building which was inaugurated shortly afterward. Also, it revealed a renovation in its corporate image. That same year, TACA became the second user of the Brazilian Embraer 190 in Latin America.

===AviancaTACA and modernization (2009‚Äì12)===
On 7 October 2009, it was announced that TACA International would merge its assets in a strategic alliance with Colombian flag carrier Avianca, in which case each will maintain its trademark and operations. Avianca and TACA International operated a combined fleet of 129 aircraft, serving over 100 destinations in several countries in America and Europe. In December 2009 approval for the merger was given by the Colombian Civil Aeronautical Agency. The merger of Colombia&#x27;s Avianca and El Salvador-based TACA is the latest sign that consolidation in the Latin American airline sector is picking up.

In June 2011, AviancaTaca signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for 51 A320 family aircraft, including 33 eco-efficient Airbus A320neos. This made it the largest order for the A320neo in Latin America.

====Star Alliance (2010‚Äì12)====
On 10 November 2010, Star Alliance announced that Avianca and TACA International were to become full members in mid-2012.

===Completion of merger and final flight===
Avianca and TACA completed their merger on 21 May 2013. The day prior, just before midnight, TACA International began to remove all its signs bearing the TACA logo from airports across the US, Canada, Mexico, Central America, South America, and the Caribbean. The last flight with the TACA callsign took place on 20 May 2013. The flight was TACA Flight 566 from El Salvador International Airport to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City. It departed San Salvador at 7:50 pm MST and landed in New York at 2:35 am EST. The flight landed two hours and thirty-five minutes after the official re-branding of the airlines; thus, the flight departed with the TACA callsign and landed with the Avianca callsign. The final official TACA flight to have the TACA callsign was TACA Flight 520 from San Salvador to Los Angeles. This flight departed at 7:20 p.m. MST and landed at 11:50 pm PDT. The first flight departing operated by Avianca El Salvador took place on 21 May 2013. The flight was then Avianca El Salvador Flight 561 from San Francisco to San Salvador. The flight departed at 1:25 a.m. PDT and landed at 7:55 a.m. MST. This was followed by Avianca El Salvador Flight 521 from Los Angeles to San Salvador. This flight departed at 1:30 a.m. PDT and landed at 7:30 a.m. MST.

===Merger and controversy in Costa Rica (2012‚Äì13)===

On 10 October 2012, it was reported in a press conference that the trade name TACA International would disappear from the public eye and the promotion and marketing strategies would be owned by Avianca, according to representatives of the group that controls the brand. AviancaTaca&#x27;s CEO, Fabio Villegas, explained that the use of the single brand for the group would occur in the first half of 2013. Although the TACA trade name would disappear from the public eye, TACA will continue to operate but it will operate under the Avianca El Salvador brand and it will remain a full member of Star Alliance. Despite the TACA name being permanently retired, Avianca El Salvador continues to use the IATA and IACO identifiers &quot;TA&quot; and &quot;TAI&quot;, along with the call sign &quot;TACA&quot; for flights.

On 18 May 2013, AviancaTaca Holding downgraded the Juan Santamar√≠a International Airport hub in San Jos√©, Costa Rica to a base of operations as part of the post-merger restructuring. This included the discontinuation of more than five non-stop flights made by the airline to and from San Jose, including flights to all cities in the United States. As a consequence, more than 200 employees lost their jobs (equivalent to 20% of the workforce of the airline). This was controversial in Costa Rica and led to an extensive investigation by the civil aviation authorities of that country against the holding company.

In November 2022, Avianca painted one of its Airbus A320s (registration: N564AV) in TACA Airlines&#x27; 1990s livery.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 3 June 1945, a Douglas DC-3 (registered YS-22) owned by TACA and operated by Aerovias Brasil made an emergency landing on the Rede Mineira de Via√ß√£o and caught fire. All 4 crew members survived.
* On 17 March 1947, a Lockheed C-60 Lodestar (registered YS-28) crashed into the Cerro del Padre Amaya mountain range in Colombia, killing all 8 occupants.
* On 5 March 1959, a Vickers Viscount (registered YS-09C) crashed shortly after take-off from Managua International Airport at Managua, Nicaragua when both port engines failed. 15 of the 19 people on board were killed.
* On 2 May 1976, a Douglas DC-6 (registered YS-35C) undershot the runway on approach to the Rubelsanto Airport in Guatemala. No crew members were killed.
* On 2 February 1980, a Lockheed L-188 Electra (registered YS-07C) caught fire while on the ground in San Salvador, damaging the aircraft beyond repair.
* On 24 May 1988, TACA Flight 110, a Boeing 737-300 (registered N75356) operating to New Orleans, suffered a double engine flame-out due to water ingestion, a result of an in-flight encounter with an area of hefty rain and hail. The design of the engines and FAA water ingestion certification standards did not take into account the higher water volume of strong or severe thunderstorms while operating at lower power. The plane landed without further damage on a grass levee at the NASA Michoud Assembly Facility. All 45 passengers were uninjured.
* On 20 July 1988, a Douglas DC-6 (registered N33VX) lost power on three of its four engines due to fuel starvation. The aircraft attempted an emergency landing, but the wing hit the ground upon landing at Golden Meadow, Louisiana, destroying the aircraft. All 3 crew members were killed.
* On 5 April 1993, TACA Flight 510, a Boeing 767-200 (registered N767TA), overran the runway at Guatemala City&#x27;s La Aurora International Airport due to an inability to brake on the flooded runway.
* On 24 April 1995, a Cessna Citation I (registered N120ES) undershot the runway on approach to the Comalapa International Airport in San Salvador, colliding with trees 2,500 feet short of the runway. Both crew members survived.
* On 30 May 2008, TACA Flight 390, an Airbus A320-200 (registered EI-TAF), overran a rain-soaked runway on landing at Toncont√≠n International Airport in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. There were 5 fatalities, 2 of which were on the ground.

<text>Lillingstone Dayrell is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Lillingstone Dayrell with Luffield Abbey, in Buckinghamshire, England. It is about three and a half miles north of Buckingham, eight miles west of Milton Keynes and five miles south of Towcester.

The village name &#x27;Lillingstone&#x27; is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means &#x27;Lytel&#x27;s boundary stone&#x27;, referring to the proximity of both places to the border with Northamptonshire. In the Domesday Book of 1086, both settlements were recorded jointly as &quot;Lillingestan&quot; though already at that time there were two manors owned respectively by the Dayrell and Lovell families. The suffix &#x27;Dayrell&#x27; (as &#x27;Dayerell&#x27;) was first recorded in the fourteenth century. The Dayrell family were Lords of the Manor from the fourteenth century until the 1880s.

==Notable buildings==
The parish church of Lillingstone Dayrell is dedicated to St Nicholas of Myra.

Lillingstone House is the ancient seat of the Dayrell family.

In 1882, the banker Abraham John Robarts, of Robarts, Lubbock &amp; Co., then the tenant of Lillingstone House, built Tile House in the village for himself, designed by Ewan Christian. This is described by Nikolaus Pevsner as ‚ÄúNeo-Elizabethan, big and forbidding with groups of huge chimneys.‚Äù

==Notable people==
*Gerald Robarts (1878‚Äì1961), banker, soldier, and notable squash player, lived at Lillingstone Dayrell House.

== Civil parish ==
In 1961 the parish had a population of 121. On 1 April 2001 the parish was abolished and merged with Luffield Abbey to form &quot;Lillingstone Dayrell with Luffield Abbey&quot;.

<text>Lillingstone Lovell is a village and civil parish in north Buckinghamshire, England. It is located around north of Buckingham and west of Milton Keynes, and around south of Towcester in the neighbouring county of Northamptonshire. Silverstone Circuit is located just over north-west of Lillingstone Lovell.

The parish adjoins that of Lillingstone Dayrell with Luffield Abbey. The toponym &quot;Lillingstone&quot; is derived from the Old English for &quot;Lytel&#x27;s boundary stone&quot;, referring to the proximity of both places to the Northamptonshire boundary. At the time of the Domesday Book in 1086 both settlements were recorded jointly as &quot;Lillingestan&quot;, though at that time there were already two manors owned respectively by the Dayrell and Lovell families. During the 13th century Lillingstone Lovell was known as &quot;Lillingstone Magna&quot; while Lillingstone Dayrell was recorded as &quot;Lillingstone Parva&quot;; this is believed to refer more to administrative ascendancy rather than territorial size. The adoption of the &quot;Lovell&quot; name came later, probably in reference to the lordship of the manor by the Lovell family line which died out in the early 14th century.

Unlike its neighbour, Lillingstone Lovell was a detached portion of Oxfordshire under the control of the royal manor of Kirtlington, valued for its woodland and hunting being part of the ancient Whittlewood Forest. It was transferred to Buckinghamshire under the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844.

The central part of the village, focussed on the church, Main Street and Brookside, was designated as a Conservation Area in 1989.

==Church==
The Church of England parish church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary is believed to date from the 13th century but was rebuilt in the 14th century. By the middle part of the 18th century it had fallen into disrepair and was repaired and refurbished around 1777 retaining the original medieval tower. It is a Grade I listed building.

<doc id="417573" wikidata="Q7696262" url="?curid=417573" title="Telegraph sounder">
<text>A telegraph sounder is an antique electromechanical device used as a receiver on electrical telegraph lines during the 19th century. It was invented by Alfred Vail after 1850 to replace the previous receiving device, the cumbersome Morse register and was the first practical application of the electromagnet. When a telegraph message comes in it produces an audible &quot;clicking&quot; sound representing the short and long keypresses ‚Äì &quot;dots&quot; and &quot;dashes&quot; ‚Äì which are used to represent text characters in Morse code. A telegraph operator would translate the sounds into characters representing the telegraph message.

Telegraph networks, used from the 1850s to the 1970s to transmit text messages long distances, transmitted information by pulses of current of two different lengths, called &quot;dots&quot; and &quot;dashes&quot; which spelled out text messages in Morse code. A telegraph operator at the sending end of the line would create the message by tapping on a switch called a telegraph key, which rapidly connects and breaks the circuit to a battery, sending pulses of current down the line.

The telegraph sounder was used at the receiving end of the line to make the Morse code message audible. Its simple mechanism was similar to a relay. It consisted of an electromagnet attached to the telegraph line, with an iron armature near the magnet&#x27;s pole balanced on a pivot, held up by a counterweight. When current flowed through the electromagnet&#x27;s winding, it created a magnetic field which attracted the armature, pulling it down to the electromagnet, resulting in a &quot;click&quot; sound. When the current ended, the counterweight pulled the armature back up to its resting position, resulting in a &quot;clack&quot; sound. Thus, as the telegraph key at the sending end makes and breaks the contact, the sounder echoes the up and down state of the key.

It was important that a sounder make a sound both when the circuit was broken and when it was restored. This was necessary for the operator clearly to distinguish the long and short keypresses ‚Äì the &quot;dashes&quot; and &quot;dots&quot; ‚Äì that make up the characters in morse code.

<doc id="417574" wikidata="Q904480" url="?curid=417574" title="Murmur (album)">
<text>Murmur is the debut studio album by American alternative rock band R.E.M., released on April 12, 1983, by I.R.S. Records. The album was recorded at Reflection Studios in Charlotte, North Carolina, with musicians Don Dixon and Mitch Easter serving as producers. &quot;Murmur&quot; drew critical acclaim upon its release for its unconventional sound, defined by lead singer Michael Stipe&#x27;s cryptic lyrics, guitarist Peter Buck&#x27;s jangly guitar style, and bass guitarist Mike Mills&#x27;s melodic basslines. In 2003, the album was ranked number 197 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. It retained the position in the 2012 list and was raised to number 165 in the 2020 revision.

==Musical style==
On &quot;Murmur&quot;, guitarist Peter Buck took stylistic cues from the Byrds, Television, and the Feelies. Vocalist Michael Stipe has been said to have &quot;elevated mumbled vocals to an art form.&quot; The album&#x27;s rhythm section is heavily influenced by British post-punk, albeit omitting the funk influence associated with the style.

==Recording==
R.E.M. started preparing for their debut album in December 1982. I.R.S. paired R.E.M. with producer Stephen Hague, who had a higher profile than the band&#x27;s previous producer Mitch Easter. Hague&#x27;s emphasis on technical perfection did not suit the band; the producer made the group perform multiple takes of the song &quot;Catapult&quot;, which demoralized drummer Bill Berry. Also, Hague took the completed track to Syncro Sound studios in Boston and added keyboard parts to the track without the band&#x27;s permission and to their dismay. Unsatisfied, the band members asked the label to let them record with Easter. I.R.S. agreed to a &quot;tryout&quot; session, allowing the band to travel to North Carolina and record the song &quot;Pilgrimage&quot; with Easter and producing partner Don Dixon. After hearing the track, I.R.S. permitted the group to record the album with Dixon and Easter.

On January 6, 1983, R.E.M. entered Reflection Studios in Charlotte, North Carolina, to begin recording sessions with Easter and Dixon. Much of the band&#x27;s material for the album had been tested on preceding tours. Because of its bad experience with Hague, the band recorded the album via a process of negation, refusing to incorporate rock music clich√©s such as guitar solos or then-popular synthesizers, to give its music a timeless feel. Berry specifically was resistant to &quot;odd&quot; musical suggestions, insisting that his drums be recorded in a drummer&#x27;s booth, a practice that was antiquated at the time. Dixon and Easter took a hands-off approach to much of the recording process. The pair would only fix up a vocal track or ask lead singer Michael Stipe to re-record a vocal if it was very substandard. &quot;Being both musicians, our approach was to leave as little imprint as possible,&quot; Dixon said in 1994, referring to himself and Easter. &quot;We felt like our job was to, as cheaply as possible, reproduce what appeared to be just them playing live.&quot;

Due to Peter Buck&#x27;s Fender Twin Reverb being &quot;dead&quot;, every song except &#x27;Pilgrimage&#x27; featured Easter&#x27;s Ampeg Gemini II. Mike Mills&#x27;s Dan Armstrong bass guitar was set aside in favor of a Rickenbacker 4001, owned by Easter&#x27;s girlfriend.

Recording was completed on February 23, 1983.

In a rare instance of R.E.M. co-writing, Stipe asked friend Neil Bogan to contribute lyrics to &quot;West of the Fields&quot;.

==Packaging==

The front cover features an image of a large quantity of the noxious weed kudzu, which grows so rapidly that it overtakes the landscape and kills other plants by completely shading them. The trestle featured on the back cover of the original vinyl LP release, originally part of the Georgia Railroad line into downtown Athens, has become something of a local landmark. Plans to demolish the trestle, now commonly referred to as the &quot;&quot;Murmur&quot; Trestle&quot;, met with public outcry. On October 2, 2000, the Athens-Clarke County Mayor and Commission voted to save the trestle. In 2012, the local government said it cannot afford to keep it and declared in 2016 that it would likely come down. Later that year, the Athens-Clarke County Commission suggested that a trail tax could fund its existence. The Murmur Trestle was approved for demolition in 2019, and work began in 2020 to destroy it. The replacement bridge, part of the Firefly Trail, is composed of three sections: a replica of the original wooden trestle design and two sections of new weathered steel arches. The bridge was opened to the public in April 2023.

Copies of the initial tape edition‚Äîcatalogue number CS 70604‚Äîlist The Velvet Underground cover &quot;There She Goes Again&quot; as the final track, but it is not present. This mistake was fixed with subsequent printings. The track was rumored to be intended for &quot;Murmur&quot;, but removed so that all the tracks would be original and the group would not have to take a royalty cut. The band later distanced itself from this rumor. The cover was included as a b-side to the I.R.S. issue of &quot;Radio Free Europe&quot; instead.

==Critical reception and legacy==
&quot;Murmur&quot; was released in April 1983. The record reached number 36 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart. A re-recorded version of &quot;Radio Free Europe&quot; was the album&#x27;s lead single and reached number 78 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; singles chart that year. Despite the acclaim awarded the album, by the end of 1983 &quot;Murmur&quot; had only sold about 200,000 copies, which I.R.S.&#x27;s Jay Boberg felt was below expectations. &quot;Murmur&quot; was eventually certified gold (500,000 units shipped) by the Recording Industry Association of America in 1991.

The album drew substantial critical acclaim. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album four out of five stars. Reviewer Steve Pond felt the album fulfilled the promise the band showed on &quot;Chronic Town&quot;. He wrote, &quot;&quot;Murmur&quot; is the record on which [R.E.M.] trade that potential for results: an intelligent, enigmatic, deeply involving album, it reveals a depth and cohesiveness to R.E.M. that the EP could only suggest.&quot; He concluded, &quot;R.E.M. is clearly &quot;the&quot; important Athens band.&quot; Jonathan Gregg of &quot;Record&quot; described &quot;Murmur&quot; as &quot;a splendid little film noir of an album, austere but rich in implication.&quot; He particularly praised the band&#x27;s distinctive &quot;twitchy, restless dance beat&quot; and the incomprehensibility of the album&#x27;s meaning, noting that Stipe&#x27;s already enigmatic lyrics are often hard to make out due to being sung with a deliberate slur, lost in a muddy mix, and/or drowned out by the instrumental work, resulting in an impressive sense of meaning even as the meaning itself is not understood. It was &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s Best Album of 1983, beating Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot;, The Police&#x27;s &quot;Synchronicity&quot; and U2&#x27;s &quot;War&quot;. Buck noted in 2002 that I.R.S. was &quot;mind-boggled&quot; by the album&#x27;s positive reviews, especially in the British press, since R.E.M. had not yet toured that country.

A 2023 listing of the best debut albums by &quot;Paste&quot; included &quot;Murmur&quot; at sixth place, stating that &quot;the way Buck‚Äôs guitar and Mike Mills‚Äô bass busily bounced around otherwise simple choruses created something entirely new&quot;.

Music journalist Andrew Earles highlighted the tracks &quot;Laughing&quot; and &quot;Sitting Still&quot; in his book &quot;Gimme Indie Rock&quot;, calling them &quot;required listening for absolutely any fan of American underground rock&quot;.

===Accolades===
Since its release, &quot;Murmur&quot; has featured heavily in various &quot;must have&quot; lists compiled by the music media. In 1989, it was rated number eight on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest albums of the 1980s. In 2003, the TV network VH1 named &quot;Murmur&quot; the 92nd greatest album of all time. Some of the more prominent of these lists to feature &quot;Murmur&quot; are shown below. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

==Release history==
&quot;Murmur&quot; was bundled together with &quot;Chronic Town&quot; and &quot;Reckoning&quot; in the United Kingdom as &quot;The Originals&quot; in 1993.

On November 25, 2008, I.R.S. Records, A&amp;M, and Universal Music released a 25th anniversary edition two-disc reissue of &quot;Murmur&quot;. Disc one features the standard 12-track album, digitally remastered, and disc two contains a previously unreleased live concert the band played at Larry&#x27;s Hideaway, Toronto, Canada, on July 9, 1983. This set was recorded by Blair Packham, who&#x27;d later find fame as lead singer of The Jitters.

<text>Betty Loh Ti (July 24, 1937 ‚Äì December 27, 1968), known as Loh Tih for short, was a Hong Kong actress originally from Shanghai. Known as the &quot;Classic Beauty&quot;, she was one of the most celebrated actresses of Hong Kong cinema. She is most famous for her roles in the 1960 film &quot;The Enchanting Shadow&quot;, for which she was called &quot;China&#x27;s most beautiful actress&quot; by the jury of the 1960 Cannes Film Festival, and &quot;The Love Eterne&quot;, which earned her the Golden Horse Award for Best Leading Actress in 1963. She died from barbiturate overdose at the age of 31.

== Early life ==
Betty Loh Ti was born as Hsi Chung-i on 24 July 1937 into a prominent family from Pudong, the owner of the Xi Fu Ji () Factory in Shanghai. She was born in the midst of the Battle of Shanghai, one of the bloodiest battles of the Second Sino-Japanese War, during which her father was killed by Japanese bombing before she was born.

She was the youngest of six siblings; her elder brother (born Hsi Chungchien) would grow up to become renowned actor Kelly Lai Chen. Her pet name was &quot;Liuti&quot; (ÂÖ≠Âºü, literally &quot;sixth brother&quot;, Loh Di in Shanghainese), which was later transformed into her stage name Loh Ti. Their maternal grandfather was the tycoon , who owned the Tianchan Theater, then Shanghai&#x27;s grandest theater for Chinese opera. Growing up near the opera house, she became interested in acting since early childhood and often sang along with Peking opera actors.

After their mother died in 1948, the children were brought up by their maternal grandmother. In 1949, her grandmother brought the children to Hong Kong, as part of the mass exodus from mainland China after the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War.

== Career ==
In Hong Kong, Loh&#x27;s family lived next door to Yuan Yang-an, a cofounder and top executive of Great Wall Movie Enterprises. The studio signed a five-year contract with her in 1952, when she was 15. She debuted in the 1953 film &quot;The Peerless Beauty&quot; (). At Great Wall, she was eclipsed by the company&#x27;s &quot;Three Princesses&quot; such as Hsia Moon, and was mainly cast in supporting roles. The sole exception was the 1957 film &quot;Suspicion&quot;, in which she played the female lead.

After her contract with Great Wall expired in 1958, Loh defected to Shaw Brothers Studio, which gave her more important roles. In &quot;The Magic Touch&quot; (Â¶ôÊâãÂõûÊò•, 1958), her first film with Shaw Brothers, her performance as the famous fictional beauty Lin Daiyu earned her the nickname &quot;Classic Beauty&quot;. Her 1960 film &quot;The Enchanting Shadow&quot; was a breakout success. It received an enthusiastic reception at the 1960 Cannes Film Festival, whose jury praised her as &quot;China&#x27;s most beautiful actress&quot;. In 1963, she played Zhu Yingtai, the female lead in the blockbuster &quot;The Love Eterne&quot; directed by Li Han-hsiang. It was considered her signature piece, and she won the Golden Horse Award for Best Leading Actress for her performance.

Loh joined Motion Picture &amp; General Investment (MP&amp;GI) in 1964. In 1967, she founded her own studio, Golden Eagle Film Company, together with her brother Kelly Lai Chen and director Yuan Chiufeng. She starred in 11 films from 1964 until her death in 1968.

== Personal life and death ==
Loh married actor Peter Chen Ho in January 1962, and gave birth to a daughter named Chen Mingming in September 1962, but they divorced in 1967.

On December 27, 1968, Loh was found unconscious in her apartment in Kowloon. She was sent to Queen Elizabeth Hospital but died from barbiturate overdose. She was 31.

==Legacy==
Despite her untimely death, she is considered a screen legend. In 2017, the Hong Kong Film Archive organized an exhibition to commemorate her 80th birth anniversary. According to the organizers, Betty Loh Ti&#x27;s &quot;talent and charm remain unsurpassed to this day&quot;.

<text>Avianca Costa Rica S.A., using callsign as LACSA (&quot;Spanish: Lineas A√©reas Costarricenses S.A.&quot;), minority owned by the Synergy Group, is the national airline of Costa Rica and is based in San Jos√©. It operates international scheduled services to over 35 destinations in Central, North and South America. The airline previously used the TACA/LACSA moniker when it was a subsidiary of Grupo TACA. Since May 2013, following Avianca&#x27;s purchase of Grupo TACA, Avianca Costa Rica became one of seven nationally branded airlines (Avianca Ecuador, Avianca El Salvador, etc.) operated by Avianca Group of Latin American airlines.

==History==
LACSA was formed on October 17, 1945, with the help of Pan American World Airways, and started operations on June 1, 1946, using Douglas DC-3s for local services within Costa Rica, operating as an affiliate of Pan Am. The airline was designated as Costa Rica&#x27;s Flag carrier in 1949 and was nationalized in 1958.

LACSA operated the Douglas DC-6B four-engined piston airliner from 1960 until 1976 on their regular passenger, and eventually freight, scheduled flights to Miami International Airport. The airline introduced the first of their BAC One-Eleven twin-engined jet airliners onto their Caribbean passenger route network in April 1967.

The airline also operated a subsidiary in the Cayman Islands, Cayman Brac Airways (CBA) Ltd., which it sold a 51% controlling interest in the late 1960s to the Cayman Islands government, which in turn used the air carrier to form Cayman Airways. LACSA served Grand Cayman for many years as an intermediate stop on its services between San Jos√©, Costa Rica and Miami.

Beginning in 1998, TACA/LACSA was one of the member airlines comprising the TACA Airlines alliance along with Aviateca, Nica, Isle√±a Airlines, and five other regional airlines. In 2008, a new fleet of Embraer 190 jets was introduced. Also in 2008 a new TACA logo was introduced, followed by a new fleet of Embraer 190 airplanes registered in Costa Rica and operated under the &quot;LACSA&quot; code. In October 2009, Avianca and TACA announced their merger plans to be completed in 2010. By May 28, 2013, the airlines began operating as a single commercial brand using the &quot;Avianca&quot; name.

==Destinations==
Avianca Costa Rica serves the following destinations:

===LACSA international destinations in 1973===


According to the May 31, 1973 LACSA system timetable, the airline was serving the following international destinations:

*Maracaibo, Venezuela
*Mexico City, Mexico
*Miami, Florida
*Panama City, Panama
*San Andres Island, Colombia
*San Jos√©, Costa Rica - Hub
*San Salvador, El Salvador

This same timetable states that all international flights were being operated with British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven twin jets at this time with the exception of the San Jos√©-San Andres Island route which was being flown with a Convair 440 propliner.

===International routes in 1984===
The airline was operating to such international destinations in 1984 as:
*Barranquilla, Colombia

==Accidents and incidents==
*On May 23, 1988, a leased Boeing 727-100 (registered TI-LRC), operating the route San Jos√©-Managua-Miami, collided with a fence at the end of the runway in the Juan Santamar√≠a International Airport, crashed at a nearby field next to a highway, and caught fire. The excess of weight in the front part of the airplane was the cause of the accident. There were no fatalities out of the 23 occupants.
*On 11 January 1998, LACSA flight 691, an Airbus A320-200, veered off a runway at San Francisco International Airport during the takeoff roll. The aircraft left the runway at full speed, coming to rest in a field of mud. The runway was closed after the incident, reducing take-off capacity by 50 percent, leading to massive delays at the airport. None of the 122 passengers on board the aircraft sustained injuries, and stayed at a hotel until another aircraft could transport them to their destination, San Jos√©, Costa Rica. The cause of the incident was not determined.

<text>Linslade is an area in the civil parish of Leighton-Linslade, in the Central Bedfordshire unitary authority area of Bedfordshire, England. The original village was at Old Linslade on the banks of the River Ouzel. A new settlement called Linslade grew up a mile to the south of Old Linslade in the 19th century, particularly following the opening of Leighton Buzzard railway station there in 1838. Linslade now forms part of the urban area of Leighton Buzzard.

Linslade and Leighton Buzzard were administratively separate urban districts until 1965, when Linslade was transferred from Buckinghamshire to Bedfordshire and merged with Leighton Buzzard to become Leighton-Linslade. Linslade remained a part of the Diocese of Oxford until 2008 when it joined Leighton Buzzard in the Diocese of St Albans.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Linslade&quot; is Anglo Saxon in origin, and may mean &quot;river crossing near a spring&quot;. (Though other plausible meanings exist.) The original form, recorded‚Äîfor example‚Äîin the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; of 966, was &quot;Hlincgelad&quot;; then linchlade, pronounced lince-lade but by the time of the Domesday Book, in 1086, it had become &quot;Lincelada&quot;. The name continued to evolve, e.g. Lynchelade, in 1396, first appearing in its modern form in the 16th or 17th century, but with variations continuing into the 19th century.

==History==
Archaeological findings show Roman-period remains around Bossington Lane/Stoke Road in Linslade.

===Old Linslade===
The earliest records of Linslade are of an Anglo-Saxon Manor, at the site of present-day Old Linslade, in 975 belonging to &quot;Azelina&quot;, Ralph Tailbois&#x27; wife. The original Anglo-Saxon settlement of Linslade‚Äîprominent during the 13th century‚Äîwas not located at the modern site, but was further north. It later became the hamlet of &quot;Old Linslade, superseding&quot; the original location of the 1840s. This transpired after massive growth associated with the construction of the Grand Union Canal and‚Äîparticularly‚Äîthe London and Birmingham Railway (now known as the West Coast Main Line). Linslade underwent a second major period of expansion, again associated with the railways, during the 1970s.

After the 1066 Norman Conquest, the manor was taken over by the de Beauchamp family. In 1251 a royal charter was granted to William de Beauchamp to hold a weekly market in Linslade, as well as a yearly 8-day fair. This grant was made on account of a Holy Well or Spring, located to the north of the village, which was a site of major pilgrimage. The holy well, which was a fabricated miracle to bring souls to the shrinking congregation of Old Linslade, was where the canal is sited today not far from the church.

In 1299, however, Oliver Sutton, Bishop of Lincoln, warned pilgrims off by threatening those who did not desist with excommunication. His reason for this is either that the well was unconsecrated or that the miracles being attested to happen at the well were in fact fraudulent. The vicar of Linslade‚Äîwho did not dissuade the pilgrimages from visiting the spring because of the offerings they made‚Äîwas forced to appear at the bishop&#x27;s court.

Without the pilgrims, the importance of Linslade declined. But in the 15th century, the original 12th-century church, dedicated to St Mary the Virgin, was rebuilt.

===Chelsea New Town or New Linslade===
At the beginning of the 19th century the parish population was 203, but in 1805 the Grand Union Canal was opened on the Linslade side of the River Ouzel, and in 1838 the London and Birmingham Railway (later the West Coast Main Line) was built running roughly parallel to the canal. Leighton Buzzard railway station opened with the railway in 1838, and stood in what was then open countryside in the parish of Linslade, but was built to serve the neighbouring town on the other side of the river.

The area between the station and canal was then rapidly developed. The new development was initially known as Chelsea New Town or New Linslade, and it lined the streets leading towards the bridges across the canal and River Ouzel into Leighton Buzzard. New Linslade quickly overtook the original village of Linslade a mile to the north to become the largest settlement in the parish. The original village subsequently became known as Old Linslade, and in time New Linslade became known simply as Linslade. Linslade was never its own post town, always having Leighton Buzzard addresses, despite being administratively separate.

By 1840 the parish of Linslade had 869 residents. This prompted the vicar of Linslade, the Rev. B. Perkins, to set about fundraising for a school for the parish&#x27;s poor, and a church for the New Town. Fundraising for the church was only completed by the Rev. Perkin&#x27;s successor, Rev. Peter Thomas Ouvry; and its completion in 1849 marks the point that the New Town had become Linslade.

===Bideford Green===
From the 1840s, Linslade grew steadily, although the population dipped during the two world wars. At the end of the 1960s a sustained period of development began which saw major housing estates added, so that by the end of the 1970s Linslade had over doubled in size.

===Merger with Leighton Buzzard===
In 1961 the parish and urban district of Linslade had a population of 4,139. On 1 April 1965 the parish was merged with Leighton Buzzard to form &quot;Leighton-Linslade&quot;. There was a minor adjustment (19 acres) to the boundary with neighbouring Soulbury at the same time.

In administrative terms, Linslade and Leighton Buzzard have been administered together as Leighton-Linslade since 1965. The Office for National Statistics uses the name Leighton Buzzard for the whole built-up area, including Linslade.

==Governance==
There are two tiers of local government covering Linslade, at civil parish (town) and unitary authority level: Leighton-Linslade Town Council and Central Bedfordshire Council. The town council is based at the White House on Hockliffe Street in Leighton Buzzard.

===Administrative history===
Linslade was an ancient parish in the Cottesloe Hundred of Buckinghamshire.

When parish and district councils were created under the Local Government Act 1894, Linslade was given a parish council and included in the Linslade Rural District, created from the parts of the Leighton Buzzard Rural Sanitary District and Berkhamsted Rural Sanitary District which were in Buckinghamshire. Shortly after the new districts were established, the process began for making the parish its own urban district, which came into effect on 1 October 1897, with Linslade Urban District Council replacing the parish council. Linslade Rural District was renamed at the same time, becoming Wing Rural District.

From 1912 until its abolition in 1965, Linslade Urban District Council was based at 6 Leighton Road.

Linslade Urban District was abolished in 1965, when the area was transferred to Bedfordshire and merged with Leighton Buzzard Urban District to become Leighton-Linslade Urban District. Leighton-Linslade Urban District only existed for nine years; it was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. District-level functions passed to South Bedfordshire District Council, which in turn was replaced by the unitary Central Bedfordshire Council in 2009, which also took over the functions of the abolished Bedfordshire County Council. A successor parish covering the abolished urban district of Leighton-Linslade was created in 1974, with its council taking the name Leighton-Linslade Town Council.

==Amenities==
The expansion of Linslade during the 1970s added more amenities. The principal Leighton-Linslade facilities within Linslade are Tiddenfoot Leisure Centre, which includes a swimming pool and indoor sports courts; Leighton Buzzard Golf Club and Leighton Buzzard railway station.

===Commercial===
Linslade has no high street. There are some small shops clustered around the junction of Wing Road, Stoke Road and Old Road, but signposts in that area marked &quot;town centre&quot; point towards the town centre of Leighton Buzzard on the east side of the River Ouzel.

===Education===
Bedfordshire operates a three-tier education system, with lower, middle and upper schools. Linslade has three lower schools (Linslade Lower, Southcott Lower, and Greenleas Lower). The middle school (Linslade School) and upper school (The Cedars) are located opposite each other on Mentmore Road.

===Schools===
* Linslade Lower School
* Southcott Lower School
* Greenleas Lower School
* Linslade School (Middle)
* Cedars Upper School

===Community facilities===
The 1970s expansion added one community centre on Bideford Green, run by a Residents Association; this includes a small bar. This can be hired out for public use, and is used for dance lessons, Zumba and martial arts, as well as a polling station. Dance classes can also be taken at another community centre ‚Äì the Forster Institute; and the Leanne Hughes dance school next to the station. Linslade Parish Hall (St Barnabas&#x27; Church Hall ‚Äì a school until 1961) is used by many Leighton-Linslade organisations, including Tai Chi groups. Nyamba Scout Hut is home to 1st Linslade Scouts and Guides, as well as playgroups.

===Parks and playgrounds===
Linslade has two play areas and parks at Mentmore Road on the way to Cedars School and St Barnabas opposite the railway station. 
Linslade has two semi-wild park areas. Linslade Wood (colloquially called Bluebell Wood) is a mature woodland dating back to at least the 16th century. Tiddenfoot Pit, a former quarry, turned into a lake and wildlife area. Both are managed by Greensands Trust.
Stockgrove Country Park and Rushmere Country Park are nearby.

===Sport===

As well as being home to several junior football teams, Linslade is represented at senior level by local 5-a-side team, Sporting Linslade. Sporting Linslade are the current Division 3 champions, their only domestic trophy to date. Sporting Linslade were chosen as the 5-a-side team of the year in the national Carling One-All Awards 2009.

==Notable inhabitants==
Notable people from Linslade include:
*Ciara Janson, Hollyoaks actress who portrays Nicole Owen.
*Tom Wise, the former Member of the European Parliament for the East of England jailed for expenses fraud lives in Linslade
*Russell Stannard, author of several children&#x27;s book and books on science and religion, and emeritus professor of physics at the Open University.
*Louise Dearman, actress who has played the role of both Elphaba and Glinda, the first person in the world to do so, in the West End musical Wicked.

<text>Little Brickhill is a village and civil parish in the unitary authority area of the City of Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, England. Located immediately to the west of the A5, it is just outside and overlooking the Milton Keynes urban area, about south-east of Central Milton Keynes, south-east of Fenny Stratford, and south-east of Woburn, Bedfordshire. At the 2011 census, it had a population of 407.

==History==
The village name &quot;Brickhill&quot; is a compound of Brythonic and Old English words that have the same meaning: a common occurrence in this part of the country. The Brythonic word &quot;breg&quot; means &quot;hill&quot;, as does the Old English word &quot;hyll&quot;. In the Domesday Book of 1086 the village was referred to as &quot;Brichelle&quot;. This spelling also occurs in 1422, denoting the place where John Langon was the vicar.

The village has, for a long time, gathered most of its income from the Roman road Watling Street that passes through the parish from north-west to south-east, and anciently from a fair that was established in the village in 1228. At one time the county Assize Courts were held in Little Brickhill, making it adversely larger than nearby Great Brickhill. The last time the assizes were heard here was in 1638. Between 1561 and 1620 the names of a number of executed criminals appear in the burial register of the village. The village, being located on a major route to London, was a staging post for mail and passenger stagecoaches. &quot;The Clockhouse&quot; (now converted for residential use) housed just such a staging post, incorporating a stable, office, coach sheds, a hotel and a cowshed. Upon entering the courtyard, grooves can be seen in the cobble stones under the arch that were made by the wheels of countless coaches coming and going.

==Churches==
There are two churches in the parish, one in the village itself (St Mary Magdalene, the CoE parish church) and the other (All Saints, also CoE), on the hill above. St Mary Magdalene is a Grade II* listed building;

==Amenities==
The village had two public houses, The George and The Green Man, the latter is now closed and converted to homes. The George continues as a gastro pub. The post office that was housed in the village shop closed down in 2008 which precipitated the closure of the shop itself.

==Notable residents==
* Mark Frank (16121664), college head and theologian.

* Doreen E Adcock BEM (19362020), who won the BEM for services to swimming having taught over 13,000 children in the Milton Keynes area to swim. She was also the winner of the BBC sports personality of the year unsung hero award, 2009. Doreen has a plaque on a bench in the village and also has a pillar in the Milton Keynes Rose ( https://miltonkeynesrose.org.uk/) dedicated to her achievements
* John Motson OBE (19452023), the BBC football commentator.

<doc id="417593" wikidata="Q2790916" url="?curid=417593" title="Little Horwood">
<text>Little Horwood is a village and civil parish in Buckinghamshire, England, within the Buckinghamshire Council unitary authority area. The village is about four miles east-south-east of Buckingham and two miles north-east of Winslow.

==Heritage==
The village toponym Horwood derives from the Old English for &quot;dirty or muddy wood&quot;. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; of 792 records the village as &quot;Horwudu&quot;.

The Church of England parish church of Saint Nicholas has a Perpendicular Gothic belltower built of large blocks of ashlar. The remainder of the church externally dates from the restoration of 1889 by James Piers St Aubyn. whose works as an architect is not always viewed kindly today. His Victorian Gothicisation of many churches and houses has been decried in terms ranging from vandalism to ruthless. Little Horwood church was lucky, as the interior survived relatively unscathed, as did the early 16th-century wall paintings depicting the seven deadly sins, the Jacobean pulpit and the Decorated Gothic chancel arch. The Tower has a ring of five bells, with a tenor of 9cwt 2qtrs 22lbs, tuned to the note of G.

The manor of Little Horwood anciently belonged to the abbot and convent of St Albans, but was seized by the Crown with the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the mid-16th century. It was later sold to George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, who remodelled a manor house that has since been demolished.

One mile south-east of the village is Horwood House. The Grade II listed Little Horwood Manor is a comparatively modern house, designed by A. S. G. Butler in 1938 for the industrialist George Gee.

Located between the village and nearby Great Horwood is RAF Little Horwood, a World War II airfield was constructed in 1940, and was operational from 1942 to 1946.

==Transport==
Little Horwood has an occasional daytime, weekday bus link to Milton Keynes. The nearest railway station is at (8¬Ω miles/14 km).

==Notable person==
*Percy Thrower (1913‚Äì1988), television gardening presenter, was born at Horwood House, half a mile from the village, son of the head gardener.

<text>Leo Michelson (; 12 May 1887 ‚Äì 10 April 1978) was a Latvian-American artist considered part of the √âcole de Paris, although his works span many periods and styles.

==Biography==
Michelson was born in Riga, Latvia. He attended the Imperial Academy in St. Petersburg, Russia, and then the University of Tartu (then called the University of Dorpat) in Tartu, Russian Empire.

The Russian Revolution of 1917 forced Michelson to leave Russia for Munich, Germany, where he participated in the beginnings of German Expressionism.

By 1920 Michelson was living in Paris and had established an international reputation for his paintings, prints, and sculptures. As a prominent member of the Paris School his works were shown in major exhibits throughout Western Europe, the Soviet Union, and the United States. After the fall of Paris to Nazi Germany in 1939, Michelson fled to New York City, where he spent the rest of his life.

Michelson is described as an &quot;eternal emigrant, eternal student&quot; because he was always studying and experimenting with new styles. Michelson actually carried crayons with him so he could sketch where ever he was. Art historians have compared Michelson to both Chagall and Picasso, but it was Titian who Michelson said was his inspiration.

Michelson painted over 1,000 paintings. He died on 10 April 1978. His widow, Janine, selected Marshall, Texas, as the permanent home for her late husband&#x27;s works. in what is known as the Michelson Museum of Art

<text>Little Linford is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Haversham-cum-Little Linford, in the City of Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, England. Located near the M1 motorway, the village is about north-west of Newport Pagnell and north of Central Milton Keynes. The village is separated from its neighbour and namesake Great Linford (and the rest of the Milton Keynes urban area) by the floodplain of the River Great Ouse. In 1931 the parish had a population of 45. On 1 April 1934 the parish was abolished and merged with Haversham to form &quot;Haversham cum Little Linford&quot;.

Little Linford was initially a hamlet in the manor and ecclesiastical parish of Linford. The parish church is dedicated to St Leonard.

The traditional parish name &#x27;Linford&#x27; is an Old English language word that means &#x27;ford where maple trees grow&#x27;. In the Domesday Book of 1086 the village was recorded as &quot;Linforde&quot;. The prefix &#x27;Little&#x27; was added to distinguish it from Great Linford.

==Little Linford Wood==
Little Linford Wood is owned by Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust. Today it is one of the best habitats for dormice, which were transferred to Little Linford Wood from Kent when the Channel Tunnel rail link was being constructed.

<text>Karl Ludwig Nitzsch (6 August 1751 ‚Äì 5 December 1831) was a German theologian, a professor of theology since 1790.

Nitzsch was born in Wittenberg, where he studied from 1770 to 1775. He later served as a pastor in the towns of Beucha (from 1781) and Borna (from 1785). In 1788, he became a superintendent and consistorial assessor in Zeitz. In 1790, he obtained his doctorate in theology and during the same year became a professor at the University of Wittenberg. He was married to Louise Wernsdorf, the daughter of German rhetorician Johann Christian Wernsdorf. He died in his home city of Wittenberg.

Like his son, the better-known Karl Immanuel Nitzsch, he earned some distinction in the theological world by a number of writings, including a work entitled &quot;De discrimine revelationis imperaboriae et didacticae prolusiones academicae&quot; (2 volumes, 1830). Theologically, he represented a combination of supernaturalism and rationalism (supernatural rationalism or a Kantian rational supernaturalism).

In addition to the aforementioned work, he was the author of:
* &quot;Ueber das Heil der Welt&quot;, 1817 ‚Äì On salvation of the world.
* &quot;Ueber das Heil der Kirche&quot;, 1821 ‚Äì On salvation of the church.
* &quot;Ueber das Heil der Theologie&quot; 1830 ‚Äì On salvation of theology.

<text>A spinet desk is an antique desk with an exterior shape similar to a writing table, but slightly higher and is fitted with a single drawer under the whole length of the flat top surface. The spinet desk is so named because when closed it resembles a spinet, a musical instrument of the harpsichord family.

This single drawer, however, is a dummy. It is a hinged panel that is meant to be folded in, at the same time as half of the hinged top surface is folded back onto the top of the other half, revealing an inner desktop surface of normal height, with small drawers and pigeonholes in the back. In certain spinet desks, the inner desktop surface can be drawn out a few inches, adding working space. 


The image of the front of the spinet desk shows it in a closed position while the image of the side shows it in a partly open position, just before the hinged mobile part of the top is placed on the fixed part of the top.

By this capacity of hiding or revealing the main working area the spinet desk could be said to be a smaller, less obtrusive cousin of the rolltop desk and the cylinder desk. Like them, and unlike the secretary desk or the fall front desk, it can be closed up without disturbing too much the paperwork and various documents and implements left on the main desktop surface.

<doc id="417604" wikidata="Q991253" url="?curid=417604" title="Little Marlow">
<text>Little Marlow is a village and civil parish in Buckinghamshire, England.

== History ==

The Church of England parish church of Saint John the Baptist lies at the heart of the village, not far from the river and next to the Manor House. The original construction of the church is Norman, dating from the final years of the 12th century. Most of the building was built during the 14th and 15th centuries.

Little Marlow was once the site of a Benedictine convent dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary. The convent belonged to Bisham Abbey. It was seized by the Crown in the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1547 and was eventually demolished in 1740. Today the village is in a scenic location on the River Thames, although home to a large sewage works, with exceptional birdwatching habitats on the lakes created from former gravel extraction sites.

There are two public houses in the village: the Kings Head and the Queens Head.

== Geography ==

Little Marlow is located along the north bank of the River Thames, about a mile east of Marlow. The toponym &quot;Marlow&quot; is derived from the Old English for &quot;land remaining after the draining of a pool&quot;. In 1015 it was recorded as &quot;Merelafan&quot;. Little Marlow is surrounded by the Little Marlow Lakes Country Park. 

Hamlets in the parish of Little Marlow include Coldmoorholme, Fern, Handy Cross, Sheepridge, and Winchbottom.

The village cottages are set around a large space, surrounded by lime trees, that is used as a cricket ground and village green where an annual f√™te is held.

== Culture ==
Little Marlow appears briefly in Mary Shelley&#x27;s 1826 science fiction novel &quot;The Last Man&quot;, in a sequence where the novel&#x27;s protagonist recounts how the village&#x27;s residents went about trying to prevent themselves from falling ill with the plague.

Mel B was a one-time resident of Little Marlow.

In 2021, Little Marlow was used as a temporary filming location for the &quot;Star Wars&quot; series &quot;Andor&quot;.

<doc id="417605" wikidata="Q1914721" url="?curid=417605" title="Great Marlow">
<text>Great Marlow is a civil parish within Wycombe district in the English county of Buckinghamshire, lying north of the town of Marlow and south of High Wycombe. The parish includes the hamlets of Bovingdon Green, Burroughs Grove, Chisbridge Cross and Marlow Common. Prior to November 2007 the major settlement in Great Marlow was Marlow Bottom which has now become a civil parish in its own right.

The parish has been so named since Norman times. The ancient parish of Great Marlow, named to distinguish it from Little Marlow, was large, including the town of Marlow and rural areas north and west of it. The ancient parish became a civil parish in the 19th century, and in 1896 was divided: the town became Great Marlow Urban District (later renamed Marlow Urban District), leaving the rural areas in the parish of Great Marlow. In 1934 Lane End, in the far north of the parish, was transferred from Great Marlow to the parish of Fingest.

The ecclesiastical parish of Great Marlow, which includes the town of Marlow, is now united with the parishes of Marlow Bottom, Little Marlow and Bisham (in Berkshire).

<doc id="417606" wikidata="Q1418432" url="?curid=417606" title="Expedia">
<text>Expedia Inc. is an online travel agency owned by Expedia Group, based in Seattle. The website and mobile app can be used to book airline tickets, hotel reservations, car rentals, cruise ships, and vacation packages. Expedia.com was launched on October 22, 1996 by Microsoft.

==History==
==Sponsorships==
Starting the 2018-21 cycle, Expedia Group became the first-ever global sponsor of the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Super Cup as Expedia extended to another season until 2024, but downgraded to the regional basis which it focuses to the U.S. market only starting in 2022‚Äì23 season as Hotels.com ended the sponsorship after 2021-22 season. 

Starting the pandemic-hit 2020-21 season, Expedia struck the deal with the 2020 English champions, Liverpool F.C. as a global sponsor of the website in 3 seasons until 2023.

In July 2021, Expedia became Wrexham A.F.C.&#x27;s shirt back sponsor.

==Criticism and legal issues==
===Delays in refunds of flights cancelled due to COVID-19===
In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, customers complained regarding the process to get refunds for cancelled flights. Customers complained of excessively long call times and being unable to get through to a representative. This led to many lawsuits.

===False advertising and trademark violation===
In August 2016, Buckeye Tree Lodge and Sequoia Village Inn, LLC filed a class-action lawsuit in California accusing the company and its partners of violating trademark rights of numerous independent hotel and motel establishments by running advertising implying that consumers could book reservations for those hotels on Expedia even though Expedia had no relationship with those hotels, in violation of the Lanham Act, and also falsely noting that hotels with which the company had no relationship were &quot;sold out&quot;. In April 2021, the lawsuit was settled and the company promised not to engage in false advertising.
