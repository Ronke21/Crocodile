<text>Luxair Flight 9642 (LG9642/LGL9642) was a scheduled international passenger flight from Berlin Tempelhof Airport, Germany, to Luxembourg Findel Airport, Luxembourg, operated by Luxembourg national airline Luxair. On 6 November 2002, the aircraft operating the flight, a Fokker 50 registered as LX-LGB, lost control and crashed onto a field during an attempted landing at the airport. Out of 22 passengers and crew members on board, only two people survived. The crash is the deadliest aviation disaster to occur in Luxembourg and the only fatal accident in Luxair’s history.

Luxembourg&#x27;s Administration for Technical Investigations (AET) concluded that the crash was caused by pilot error. The crew decided to accept the approach clearance that had been given by the ATC even though they had not conducted enough preparation for the landing, leading the crew to conduct a series of improvised actions. Their actions led to the override of a certain safety feature that would have prevented the propellers from entering the reverse angle, enabling the propellers to enter the reverse angle in flight and led to the lost control situation.

The result of the investigation highlighted the possible safety risk regarding the protection system against an accidental deployment of reverse angle in turboprops during mid-flight, prompting Fokker to issue a mandatory modification on the safety feature.

== Background ==
=== Aircraft ===
The aircraft involved was a Fokker F50, manufactured in 1991 with a serial number of 20221. The aircraft was delivered to Luxair on the same year registered as LX-LGB. Equipped with Pratt &amp; Whitney PW125B propellers and two Dowty propellers, it had accumulated a total of 24,068 flight cycles. According to Luxair, the aircraft had been maintained properly. The last service was conducted on 4 May. The maintenance logbook indicated that the last defect, an inoperative anti-skid system on the aircraft, had been rectified on 5 November, one day before the accident.

=== Crew ===
In command was 26-year-old Captain Claude Poeckes, who had a total flying experience of 4,242 flight hours and 2,864 hours on type. His co-pilot was 32-year-old First Officer John Arendt with total flight hours of 1,156 and 443 hours on type.

== Accident ==
Flight 9642 was a regularly scheduled international passenger flight from Berlin-Tempelhof Airport to Luxembourg Findel Airport. On 6 November, the aircraft was scheduled to take off from Tempelhof and would be piloted by Captain Claude Poeckes and his co-pilot First Officer John Arendt. It took off from Berlin at around 07:40 a.m local time with 19 passengers and 3 crew members on board.

While the aircraft was flying at its cruising altitude, at around 08:55 a.m, the pilots checked the Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) for the weather information in Luxembourg. They discovered that the runway visual range was at , lower than the minimum amount of that was required for the Fokker 50 to obtain before landing. The visibility in the area had deteriorated due to the presence of heavy fog. With such low visibility, the crew realised that there would be delay for the landing. They either had to wait until the weather condition began to improve by entering the holding pattern or diverting their aircraft to the alternate airport.

Feeling impatient, the crew decided to continue their flight to Luxembourg as planned. After several minutes, the crew checked the ATIS information again, only to discover that the visibility had not improved. They then discussed on the possible strategies for a landing during bad weather condition but failed to reach conclusion on the matter. As no decision was taken, the approach briefing was not conducted.

While First Officer Arendt was giving an address to the passengers, Captain Poeckes tried to contact Luxair officials on whether the weather had improved as a departing Cargolux jet might have cleared some of the fog in the area. To his disappointment, the airport was still covered with heavy fog. Due to the constant foggy condition, the crew were told to enter the Diekrich VOR, Findel&#x27;s holding pattern. Co-pilot Arendt then announced to the passengers that the flight would enter a holding pattern first and that they would wait until the weather began to improve.

As they were heading towards the pattern, the ATC suddenly radioed the crew and instructed them to descend to and to change their heading. The transmission caught them off guard. First Officer Arendt was initially confused by the transmission and asked Captain Poeckes: &quot;Is that for us?&quot;, to which the captain responded with &quot;yes&quot;. The crew accepted the instruction, but First Officer Arendt was still surprised by the transmission as he could be heard saying &quot;What kind of shit is that?&quot;

===Approach===
The crew still did not understand the reasons for the descent that had been requested by the controller. Fearing that they had been asked to prepare for an approach, they repeatedly checked the RVR (Runway Visual Range) value with Luxair Dispatch, but the weather in Findel Airport was still below the minimum amount for the landing. They were initially feeling uncertain about whether the controller had sent such transmission for holding or for an approach.

Afterwards, the controller sent a message that cleared the crew&#x27;s confusion. The controller specifically asked Flight 9642 to conduct an approach to Findel Airport. The crew were perplexed as the weather conditions had not met the minimum criteria for a landing. Meanwhile, the ATC did not know about the required RVR information as the crew had not informed the ATC about the matter. Despite being confused, the crew accepted the controller&#x27;s request anyway and started to fly their aircraft as per the controller&#x27;s instructions. The crew now realized that they had been chosen as the first aircraft that would land at Findel, increasing their workload pressure. Following the transmission, the crew frantically prepared their aircraft for an approach.

The flight eventually levelled off at and was approaching the radio beacon ELU, the point for final approach fix. During the approach to the beacon, Captain Poeckes told First Officer Arendt that they would conduct a missed approach if the weather was still below . After successfully capturing the airport&#x27;s ILS, the crew checked on the RVR again, only to discover that the weather had deteriorated even further. The RVR had dropped to . With the minimums now clearly too low, the crew finally told ATC that they would need an RVR of for a landing.

After rushing through the approach checklist, the aircraft finally reached ELU. They checked the RVR again and the report did not indicate any improvements. Captain Poeckes then told First Officer Arendt that they would execute a missed approach, but the aircraft kept continuing to Findel. First Officer Arendt kept checking the approach checklist and then put the ground idle stop in the off position, as it was the last action that the crew were required to do on the checklist.

Captain Poeckes was not satisfied with the weather report and eventually called for a go-around at 09:04 local time. Just 10 seconds later, however, the ATC reported that the RVR had improved to 300 metres, the exact minimum amount for the landing of the Fokker 50. Immediately after this announcement, Captain Poeckes changed his mind and First Officer Arendt prepared the aircraft for landing.

===Crash===
As they had been levelling off for quite some time after passing point ELU, the aircraft was flying a bit higher than the glideslope. To reduce their altitude faster, Captain Poeckes stated that he would try to reduce the power lever to flight idle, claiming that by doing so the aircraft would quickly descend to the required altitude. However, First Officer Arendt voiced his concern and told Captain Poeckes that such action would not be enough to slow down the aircraft.

First Officer Arendt reported to the ATC that they would continue the approach to Findel. Flight 9642 was eventually cleared to land and the crew extended the landing gear.

After extending the landing gear, the propeller speed began to increase, startling the crew due to the audible noise. The aircraft&#x27;s speed and altitude then rapidly dropped. The crew realised that the reverse thrust had been deployed in mid-flight and tried to save the aircraft. In an attempt to regain lift, First Officer Arendt immediately retracted the flaps and Captain Poeckes moved the thrust lever fully forward. The aircraft, however, continued to plummet towards the ground.

As a last resort, the crew decided to shut down both engines. It did not stop the aircraft&#x27;s rapid descent. Faced with imminent crash, the crew tried to flare as much as possible to prevent a destructive impact.

The aircraft slammed onto terrain with its belly, crossing the Route Nationale 1 and scraped the road with its left wing. It then struck an embankment, inflicting major damage to the airframe. The aircraft bounced and both wheels and blades came off of the aircraft. The empennage and part of the right wing broke away. The aft fuselage detached and rested on its right side. The aircraft eventually came to a halt further away. After coming to a stop, a fire began to erupt on the central portion of the crushed fuselage.

===Immediate aftermath===

Flight 9642 suddenly ceased all contact with Findel Airport. Its blip had disappeared from the radar screen, prompting the controller to call the crew multiple times to confirm their condition. As there was no response, the airport emergency services were alerted to a possible crash. A telephone call from a witness eventually confirmed that the aircraft had crashed near the airport. Meanwhile, at the crash site, taxi driver Guillaume Wainachter was the first to arrive. He attempted to save the passengers in the fuselage as survivors could be heard screaming loudly inside the wreckage. While trying to save the survivors, he heard a noise from the aircraft, and it immediately went up in flames in a matter of seconds.

It was immediately found that the aircraft had crashed in a field to the north of runway centreline. The wreckage was located between the village of Niederanven and Roodt-Syr. Rescue services found several passengers had been ejected from the aircraft. One survivor had been ejected from the aircraft during the crash and was found outside. Three survivors were extricated alive from the fuselage and immediately rushed to the hospital, all of whom later succumbed to their injuries. Captain Poeckes was found trapped inside the cockpit, but he survived as the cockpit did not catch fire. Rescuers had to cut a hole to evacuate him from the wreckage.

The fog was so thick that some nearby residents were unaware of the crash. Most of them claimed not to have seen or even heard anything when the crash occurred, and only realized that something had happened nearby when ambulances and emergency services arrived at the crash site.

Due to the crash, Findel Airport was closed for more than three hours. Several flights had to be diverted to Germany and Belgium.

==Victims==

Most of the passengers were business officials from Germany. Seventeen were found dead at the crash site with five survivors, three of whom died in the hospital. By nightfall, 18 bodies out of the 20 dead were found, while the other two remained missing. The bodies were thought to be buried under the smoldering fuselage. Rescue workers were using a crane to disentangle the charred remains. Amongst the passengers killed on the flight was artist Michel Majerus.

== Response ==
Following the crash, a hospital in Belgium was put on alert. A total of 300 police officers were dispatched to the crash site. Government of Luxembourg requested additional help from the Belgian government, which deployed three helicopters to the crash site and a military hospital was put on standby.

Incumbent Prime Minister of Luxembourg Jean-Claude Juncker visited the site of the accident on the same day of the crash, accompanied by Luxembourgish Interior Minister Michel Wolter, Transport Minister Henri Grethen and Grand Duchess of Luxembourg Maria Teresa. An emergency meeting was eventually convened by the prime minister to investigate the crash. German Transport Minister Manfred Stolpe visited the country to meet with officials regarding the crash of Flight 9642.

Relatives of the victims were ushered to a special morgue to see the victims. Psychological counseling would be provided by the state for affected family members. State flags were ordered to be lowered at half-mast across the country until 10 November. A ceremonial service was held on 7 November, followed by another service which was held on 10 November on the capital&#x27;s Notre-Dame cathedral.

== Investigation ==
Officials could not theorize on the possible causes of the accident during the initial aftermath of the crash. They did note that the flight&#x27;s destination airport was covered by autumnal fog. Nearby residents of Niederanven stated that the fog at the time of the accident was very thick, so much that nearby residents could not realize that a crash had just occurred, even though Niederanven was in close proximity to the crash site.

The maintenance logbook was also clean. The aircraft was inspected by a maintenance crew on the evening before the flight. The only recurring defect was the inoperative anti-skid system, which was rectified a day before the accident.

=== Lack of preparation ===
At 07:53 a.m local time, the crew of the flight established their first contact with the approach controller. While approaching the airport, the crew sought information about the visibility at the airport, to which the controller replied with the available data on the RVR. The crew were worried with the discovery as it was under the minimum amount for Fokker F50 and decided to wait within the holding pattern until the weather began to improve. This crucial information regarding the minimum visibility was not relayed to the controller and caused the controller to consider the crew of being capable to conduct an approach regardless of the RVR value. Meanwhile, the crew thought that it was going to be awhile before they managed to get a landing clearance and therefore no landing preparation was conducted.

While Flight 9642 was approaching the holding pattern, the controller realized that the holding pattern had become nearly full of traffic as there were three other Luxair flights in it. The controller wanted to clear the holding pattern from being jam-packed by asking one of the flights to immediately conduct an approach. Coincidentally, Flight 9642 was the most suitable for such decision as they had not reached the holding pattern yet and by asking the crew to conduct an approach there would be lesser delay for the other aircraft. The controller then instructed the crew to start executing an approach to Findel.

After a bit of confusion and another confirmation from the controller, the unprepared crew were taken aback by the order. They were initially certain that they were going to wait within the holding pattern, but the sudden transmission from the controller effectively cut their remaining time until landing. They quickly checked their checklist and hastily briefed the approach, in which during the course they accidentally missed some of the per procedure actions due to their time constraint.

Feeling uncertain with the approach, Captain Poeckes told First Officer Arendt that they would perform a go-around if the RVR was still below the minima. First Officer Arendt, however, chose to ignore him and continued with the approach checklist, a hint of a possible crew breakdown due to the lack of preparation for the approach. Captain Poeckes eventually called for a go-around, but after an updated RVR report informed him that the weather had met the exact minimum for a landing, he immediately changed his mind and decided to continue the approach.

The sudden decision from the crew to continue the approach pressed the crew to immediately capture the glide slope as the aircraft had been levelling off at 3,000 ft and they had overflown the final approach point for the airport, the exact point where pilots should start descending for the final approach. There was no known procedure for the crew to intercept the glideslope after passing the final approach point. The crew should have executed a missed approach, but instead they kept their mind to land in Findel as quickly as possible.

Knowing that they were flying quite high above the glideslope, Captain Poeckes reduced the engine thrust. Eager to quickly capture the glideslope, he decided to improvise, using a skill that he had learned previously.

=== Reverse range ===
To gain the intended speed, Captain Poeckes tried to make the engines to enter the ground range by lifting the ground range selector. By doing so, the airspeed would decrease further and, as per Poeckes&#x27;s understanding, their aim to get the glideslope quickly would be attained. While this technique could be used by pilots to slow down their aircraft, it was prohibited if they were still in the air. Beyond the ground range was the reverse range, which would change the propeller pitch to reverse. The reverse pitch was usually used while the aircraft was rolling on the runway during landing. Entering this range in the air would produce massive drag forces on the aircraft and would endanger the flight. To prevent an accidental deployment of the reverse range, the aircraft was equipped with a secondary stop, a specific safety feature which was regulated by the flight idle solenoid.

However, said specific feature could be overridden by a design flaw within the flight system of the Fokker F50. Fokker acknowledged that the extension of the landing gear could produce an electromagnetic interference within the aircraft&#x27;s anti-skid units, causing the aircraft to think that the wheels were spinning, indicating that it was already on the ground, for a period of 30 microseconds. The brief glitch powered up the flight idle solenoids and tricked them into thinking that the aircraft was rolling on the runway, causing them to temporarily open the secondary stop feature for 16 seconds.

In Flight 9642, as the aircraft was about to land, the crew extended the landing gear and configured the aircraft accordingly. The electromagnetic interference occurred and this in turn energized the flight idle solenoids, opening the secondary stop. Captain Poeckes presumably was concerned about the limited time and their current altitude and pulled the lever back even further from the ground range to the reverse range in order to capture the glideslope faster. Normally, the secondary stop would have prohibited the thrust from entering the reverse range, but as the 16 seconds activation was still in effect, the reverse thrust was engaged.

The activation of the reverse thrust in mid-air caused difficulties in controlling the aircraft. The propeller speed suddenly jumped and produced sound loud enough for the pilots to be startled. The airspeed then dropped and the aircraft quickly lost lift, losing altitude rapidly. The crew attempted to save their aircraft by cutting off the fuel flows to the engines, but the aircraft continued to plunge. In a last attempt, they tried to flare as much as possible to prevent a violent impact. They knew that the reverse thrust had been deployed in mid-air, but could not rectify the problem.

=== Design flaw ===
Fokker knew about the possible aircraft-induced reset of the secondary stop as early as 1988. The cause of the glitch was identified during maintenance activities in which the power-up effect of the aircraft&#x27;s anti-skid system was found to be the culprit. However, due to the low probability of such incidence to occur, Fokker thought that no immediate corrective actions were required. For the reset to occur, these conditions had to be met:
* Landing gear must be lowered
* Anti-skid units must be powered and opened locks of the secondary stop for 16 seconds
* The lever must be below the flight idle position and the crew had to lift the ground range selector (considered to be not normal)
* Within the 16 seconds timeframe, the crew must continue to pull the thrust lever down.

In December 1994, Fokker disseminated the findings to all operators of the aircraft, including Luxair.

The company had attempted to modify their anti-skid units. In 1992, a non-binding service bulletin was issued, telling operators to transport their Fokker F50 fleets for a voluntary modification on their anti-skid units, which would prevent such failure from occurring. Multiple Fokker F50 had been turned in to Fokker to undergo modifications, but the involved Luxair aircraft was not among those sent as it was not mandatory for operators to send their aircraft for an updated design.

===Conclusion===
In December 2003, Luxembourgish AET published the final report. It concluded the cause of the crash as follow:
Contributing to the accident were errors concerning the implementation of a safety recommendation which had been made by the manufacturer to Fokker 50 operators.

The crash significantly affected all Fokker F50 aircraft that were being operated in Luxembourg. Nearly two weeks after the crash, following the discovery of the failure of the secondary stop safety feature to prevent the thrust from entering the reverse range, authorities decided to change the issued service bulletins regarding the anti-skid units from voluntary to mandatory. In May 2003, Dutch authorities announced that the modifications would be made mandatory. Every Fokker 50 in Luxembourg were subjected to compulsory modification on the anti-skid control system and should be changed accordingly after November 2003. AET also recommended Fokker to conduct review on the aircraft&#x27;s current design as flaw within the aircraft could threaten the safety of flights by overriding the aircraft&#x27;s safety feature.

== Aftermath ==

A criminal prosecution was launched but was delayed until 10 October 2011. Captain Poeckes, three former Luxair executives, and three mechanics (one of whom was formally a technical director) were all charged with involuntary manslaughter and negligence. The executives were later acquitted. On 27 March 2012, the remaining defendants were all found guilty. Captain Poeckes was sentenced to 42 months (3.5 years) of probation and to pay a fine of 4,000 euros. The three mechanics were sentenced to 18 months, two years, and four years of probation respectively, and to pay fines of 2,000 to 2,500 euros. In January 2014, the families of four of the victims received 21,000 to 130,000 euros in compensation. In February the same year, the attorneys of the convicted appealed the court&#x27;s verdict. In May 2015, a court paid 310,000 euros in compensation to the families of three German victims.

==In popular culture==
The accident will be featured in season 25, episode 4 of the Canadian documentary series &quot;Mayday&quot;, titled &quot;Second Thoughts&quot;.

<doc id="414029" wikidata="Q1228567" url="?curid=414029" title="Alan Howarth, Baron Howarth of Newport">
<text>Alan Thomas Howarth, Baron Howarth of Newport, (born 11 June 1944), is a British Labour Party politician and life peer who was a member of Parliament (MP) from 1983 to 2005. First elected as a Conservative before defecting to Labour in 1995, he is one of few politicians in recent years to have served as a minister in both Labour and Conservative governments. He currently sits in the House of Lords as a Labour life peer.

==Early life==
He is the son of Major Thomas Howarth MC (Chief Master of King Edward&#x27;s School, Birmingham, Second Master of Winchester College and High Master of St. Paul&#x27;s School) and Margaret Teakle (who was a Wren in the Second World War). He was educated at Rugby School and gained a BA in History from King&#x27;s College, Cambridge in 1965.

Howarth subsequently worked in the Conservative Party Chairman&#x27;s office in Conservative Central Office under Willie Whitelaw and Peter Thorneycroft, before becoming director of the Conservative Research Department and party vice-chairman.

==Parliamentary career==
Having been appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1982 New Year Honours for political service, Howarth was Conservative Party MP for Stratford-on-Avon, first elected in 1983. He was a founder member of the Thatcherite No Turning Back group. He served as a whip, and was subsequently Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Science from 1989 to 1992, becoming the architect of the polytechnics&#x27; transition to university status.

===Defection===
On 7 October 1995, Howarth announced his resignation from the Conservative Party and defected to the Labour Party, the first MP to defect directly from the Conservatives to Labour, and the first former Conservative MP to sit as a Labour MP since Sir Oswald Mosley. The timing of the defection was crucial, as it immediately preceded the Conservative Party conference, the first since Prime Minister John Major had been challenged for the party leadership earlier in the year. He wanted a new seat to contest as a Labour candidate and, after failing to win the seats of Wentworth and Wythenshawe and Sale East, he was selected for the safe Labour seat of Newport East in Wales. The National Union of Mineworkers leader Arthur Scargill stood against him under the Socialist Labour Party banner, but he easily held the seat for Labour.

After the election victory of 1997, he was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment, becoming Minister for the Arts at the Department of Culture, Media and Sport the following year. He is also a member of the Privy Council. He was dropped from the government after the 2001 general election, and stood down from the House of Commons at the 2005 general election. Jessica Morden was selected to replace him as candidate by the Constituency Labour Party. By the time he stood down, he had spent only 18 months of his 22-year career as an MP on the opposition benches (October 1995 to May 1997).

On 15 June 2005, he was created a life peer as Baron Howarth of Newport, of Newport in the County of Gwent. In a House of Lords debate on the outcome of the European Union Referendum on 5 July 2016, Lord Howarth announced his support for Britain&#x27;s departure from the European Union.

==Personal life==
Howarth married Gillian Chance in 1967. They have two daughters (born 1974 and 1975) and two sons (born 1977 and April 1985). They divorced in 1996. He was later the partner of Labour peer Patricia Hollis who died in 2018.

<doc id="414032" wikidata="Q1282293" url="?curid=414032" title="Ed Bryant">
<text>Edward Glenn Bryant (born September 7, 1948) is an American politician who is a former Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from Tennessee (1995–2003). From 1991–1993, he served as the United States Attorney for the Western District of Tennessee. On December 12, 2008, Bryant was sworn in as a United States magistrate judge for the Western District of Tennessee. He retired from this position on February 28, 2019.

== Early life ==
Ed Bryant was born and raised in Jackson, Tennessee. His mother was a registered nurse, while his father was an electrician. Bryant attended Tennessee Technological University for a year before transferring to the University of Mississippi, where he received both his B.A. in 1970 and J.D. in 1972. As a student, he was active in the Sigma Nu fraternity. Bryant was also selected to the national leadership organization of Omicron Delta Kappa.

He received a commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant in the United States Army through the Army Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps. Initially serving in the Military Intelligence Corps, Bryant was later selected to serve in the Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Corps. During his time in the U.S. Army, he was assigned to the Ballistic Missile Defense System Command in Huntsville, Alabama, the 4th Infantry Division at Fort Carson in Colorado and taught constitutional law to cadets at the United States Military Academy at West Point. Bryant served another year in the Tennessee Army National Guard.

Upon returning to Jackson, Tennessee, he joined the law firm of Waldrop &amp; Hall and was later elected President of the Madison County Bar Association.

== Entrance into politics ==
Bryant first became politically active in a high-profile way in 1988 when he served as an early organizer for the abortive presidential bid of conservative televangelist Pat Robertson. Earlier that year, Eighth District Congressman Ed Jones decided not to run for reelection. Bryant won the Republican nomination for the district, a largely Democratic area mostly in the northwestern part of the state. He lost in the general election to Union City attorney and state representative John S. Tanner. Bryant resumed the practice of law, having been appointed as United States Attorney for the Western District of Tennessee by President George H. W. Bush in 1991. He later moved to Henderson, near Jackson, located in the neighboring Seventh Congressional District.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==
When Seventh District Congressman Don Sundquist did not run for re-election in 1994 (choosing instead to wage an ultimately successful campaign for governor), Bryant won the Republican primary for the district. The 7th is one of the state&#x27;s most Republican districts outside of East Tennessee. Under the circumstances, Bryant&#x27;s victory in November was a foregone conclusion.

In his three subsequent re-elections, Bryant never failed to receive under 60% of the vote. His only serious opposition came in his first reelection bid, when Clarksville mayor Don Trotter faced him. Bryant defeated him by over 30 points. As of the 2016 elections, Trotter is the last reasonably well-financed Democrat to run in the 7th, and one of only three Democrats to make a serious bid for the seat since it fell into Republican hands in 1972 (when it was numbered as the 6th District; it has been the 7th since 1983). Bryant was unopposed in 1998, and was reelected by over 40 points in 2000.

Bryant established a solidly conservative record and was a darling of both business-oriented groups such as the National Federation of Independent Business and social conservative groups such as the American Conservative Union, the National Rifle Association of America, and National Right-to-Life. He was best known as one of the House managers (prosecutors) in the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton. Bryant was regarded by many as one of the less strident and pompous and more personable managers. This is supposedly why Monica Lewinsky chose Bryant to be the manager to interview her about the case.

== 2002 U.S. Senate election ==
In 2002 Bryant entered the Republican primary for the United States Senate after Republican Fred Thompson announced that he was changing his mind from an earlier announcement and would not be seeking re-election. The circumstances resulted in his piecing together a hurried, underfinanced campaign. Bryant was opposed by former governor of Tennessee, U.S. Secretary of Education, and two-time presidential candidate Lamar Alexander for the Republican nomination. Alexander had both greater statewide name recognition and greater financial resources, even though he hadn&#x27;t appeared on a ballot for a statewide office in Tennessee in 20 years. Despite this, Bryant held Alexander to 55% of the primary vote while garnering 44%. Additionally, Bryant made a good impression on many Republican activists in the state, especially with his willingness to make appearances on the Republican ticket&#x27;s behalf during the fall campaign after his own defeat.

== 2006 U.S. Senate election ==
After Bryant&#x27;s defeat in 2002, he moved to Nashville briefly, but returned to West Tennessee. There he sought the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate seat then-held by Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, who did not seek re-election in 2006.

Bryant faced two other major Republicans in the primary on August 3, 2006:
* Bob Corker – Former mayor of Chattanooga and 1994 Senate candidate.
* Van Hilleary – Former United States Representative and 2002 gubernatorial nominee.

In an interview with John Gibson of Fox News, Bryant stated that he did not believe Harold Ford Jr. should be considered a serious candidate for the U.S. Senate because of Ford&#x27;s young age of 36 at the time.

Bryant conceded the GOP primary election to Bob Corker on August 3, 2006.

<doc id="414036" wikidata="Q27494" url="?curid=414036" title="Zermatt">
<text>Zermatt (, ) is a municipality in the district of Visp in the German-speaking section of the canton of Valais in Switzerland. It has a year-round population of about 5,800 and is classified as a town by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (FSO).

It lies at the upper end of Mattertal at an elevation of , at the foot of Switzerland&#x27;s highest peaks. It lies about from the over high Theodul Pass bordering Italy. Zermatt is the southernmost commune of the German &quot;Sprachraum&quot;.

Zermatt is famed as a mountaineering and ski resort of the Swiss Alps. Until the mid-19th century, it was predominantly an agricultural community; the first and tragic ascent of the Matterhorn in 1865 was followed by a rush on the mountains surrounding the village, leading to the construction of many tourist facilities. The year-round population () is , though there may be several times as many tourists in Zermatt at any one time. Much of the local economy is based on tourism, with about half of the jobs in town in hotels or restaurants and just under half of all apartments are vacation apartments. Just over one-third of the permanent population was born in the town, while another third moved to Zermatt from outside Switzerland.

==Etymology==
The name of &quot;Zermatt&quot;, as well as that of the Matterhorn itself, derives from the alpine meadows, or &quot;matten&quot; (in German), in the valley. The name appeared first as &quot;Zur Matte&quot; (&quot;at the meadow&quot;) and became later Zermatt. It does not appear until 1495 on a map or 1546 in a text, but may have been employed long before.

&quot;Praborno&quot; or &quot;Prato Borno&quot; (&quot;Prato&quot; also means meadow) are the older names of Zermatt; they appear in the ancient maps as early as the thirteenth century. The Romand-speaking people from the Aosta Valley and from the Romand-speaking part of canton Wallis (Valais) used this name until about 1860 in the form of &quot;Praborne&quot;, or &quot;Praborgne&quot;. The reason of this change from &quot;Praborno&quot; to &quot;Zermatt&quot; is attributed to the gradual replacement of the Romance-speaking people by German-speaking colony.

==Geography==

The town of Zermatt lies at the southern end of the Matter Valley (German: &quot;Mattertal&quot;), which is one of the lateral branches of the grand Valley of the Rhône. Zermatt is almost completely surrounded by the high mountains of the Pennine Alps including Monte Rosa (specifically its tallest peak, named Dufourspitze), Switzerland&#x27;s highest peak at above sea level. It is followed by the Dom (), Liskamm (), Weisshorn () and the Matterhorn (). Most of the Alpine four-thousanders are located around Zermatt or in the neighbouring valleys.


Zermatt is traversed by the main river of the valley: the Matter Vispa, which rises at the glaciers at the feet of the highest peaks: the Gorner Glacier on the east side near Monte Rosa and the Zmutt Glacier on the west side between Dent d&#x27;Hérens and Dent Blanche.

The town of Zermatt, while dense, is geographically small. There are three main streets which run along the banks of the Matter Vispa, and numerous cross-streets, especially around the station and the church which forms the centre of Zermatt. In general anything is at most a thirty-minute walk away. There are several &quot;suburbs&quot; within Zermatt. Winkelmatten/Moos, which was once a separate hamlet, lies on a hill () on the southern side. Steinmatten is located on the eastern bank of the main river.

Many hamlets are located in the valleys above Zermatt, however they are not usually inhabited all year round. Zum See () lies south of Zermatt on the west bank of the Gorner gorge, near Furi where a cable car station is located (). On the side of Zmutt valley (west of Zermatt) lies the hamlet of Zmutt (), north of the creek Zmuttbach. Findeln () is located in the eastern valley above the creek Findelbach. It lies below the Sunnegga station (). Located near a train station of the Gornergratbahn, Riffelalp () is one of the highest hamlets with a chapel.

Zermatt had an area, (as of the 2004/09 survey) of . Of this area, about 9.4% is used for agricultural purposes, while 4.6% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 0.8% is settled (buildings or roads) and 85.2% is unproductive land. Over the past two decades (1979/85-2004/09) the amount of land that is settled has increased by and the agricultural land has decreased by .

==Climate==
Zermatt has a subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification: Dfc). Summertime is cool in Zermatt, with mild days and cool nights, while winter is cold and snowy, with highs around freezing and annual snowfall averaging . 
==Tourism==
The village was &quot;discovered&quot; by mid-nineteenth-century British mountaineers, most notably Edward Whymper, whose summit of the Matterhorn made the village famous. The Matterhorn was one of the last alpine mountains to be summitted (in 1865), and the first expedition that reached the top ended dramatically with only 3 of the 7 climbers surviving the descent. The story is related in the Matterhorn Museum.

Zermatt is a starting point for hikes into the mountains, including the Haute Route that leads to Chamonix in France and the Patrouille des Glaciers. Cable cars and chair lifts carry skiers in the winter and hikers in the summer; the highest of them leads to the Klein Matterhorn at , a peak on the ridge between Breithorn and Matterhorn that offers extensive views in all directions. It is possible to cross into Italy via the Cervinia cable car station. A rack railway line (the Gornergratbahn, the highest open-air railway in Europe) runs up to the summit of the Gornergrat at . Zermatt is also the western terminus for the Glacier Express rail service connecting to St. Moritz and the MGB (Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn).
Together with eleven other towns Zermatt is a member of the community &quot;Best of the Alps&quot;.

==Transport==
To prevent air pollution that could obscure the town&#x27;s view of the Matterhorn, the entire town is a combustion-engine-car–free zone. Almost all vehicles in Zermatt are battery driven and almost completely silent. Electric vehicles are allowed for local commerce. The Cantonal police can issue a permit which allows residents to drive and park at the northern outskirts and for the permission to bring combustion-engine vehicles in to the town such as construction vehicles. Emergency and municipal vehicles, (fire trucks, ambulances, police etc.) generally use combustion engines, although even some of these are non-combustion (garbage trucks, etc.).

Passenger vehicles operating within Zermatt include small electric shuttles provided by hotels to carry visitors from the main train station (or the taxi transfer point just outside town) to the hotel properties, &quot;electro&quot; taxis operated by four major Zermatt families, and &quot;electro&quot; buses, which serve two routes: one between the major hotel areas and the stations of the various ski-lifts, and the other following a similar route but also serving the more rural &quot;suburb&quot; of Winkelmatten. Horse-drawn carriages can also be found; some are operated by hotels and others are available for hire.

Most visitors reach Zermatt by the rack-assisted railway train from the nearby town of Täsch (Zermatt shuttle). Trains also depart for Zermatt from farther down the valley at Visp and Brig, which are on the main Swiss rail network. The town also has a heliport (ICAO: LSEZ) and a local helicopter operator, &quot;Air Zermatt&quot;, which also provides alpine rescue services.

In 2007, a project group was formed to evaluate options for development of the local transportation network (as the &quot;electro&quot; buses do not have enough capacity). The results of this study are published in the December 2007 edition of &quot;Zermatt Inside&quot;. The six options explored are a coaster, a funicular, a metro, moving sidewalks, a gondola and more &quot;electro&quot; buses.

In 2019 work started to improve access on the Kirchbrücke – one of the most popular places to photograph the Matterhorn. The viewing area will be widened to keep tourists off the road and away from electric vehicles. The project should be complete by autumn 2019.

The nearest airports that international air travellers to Zermatt can avail of from Switzerland are Sion Airport (SIR), which is 85 km away from the resort, Zurich Airport (ZRH), around 250 km away, and Geneva Airport (GVA), also 250 km away. Other nearby airports in Italy include Milan Malpensa (MXP), with a distance of around 180 km from Zermatt, and Milan Linate (LIN), almost 255 km away.
===Skiing in Zermatt===

Zermatt is known throughout the world for its skiing, especially Triftji for its moguls. The high altitude results in consistent skiing continuously throughout the summer.

Skiing in Zermatt is split up into four areas: Sunnegga, Gornergrat, Klein Matterhorn and Schwarzsee. There is also a connection to Cervinia and Valtournenche in Italy through the Plateau Rosa glacier.

In 2008, Zermatt hosted an &quot;Infinity Downhill Race&quot;. The race took place on 13 and 14 December and comprised a course descending from the Matterhorn Glacier Paradise () and finished in Zermatt itself (). The course was long and featured a descent.

===Sunnegga===

The Sunnegga Paradise is accessed via the SunneggaExpress funicular railway, followed by a gondola to Blauherd and finally a cable car onwards to the Rothorn (3,103 m) above. The topography of the mountain and the valley tends to keep the Rothorn clear and sunny, even when Zermatt is submerged in cloud.

From Blauherd there is a gondola down to Gant, and from there a connecting cablecar goes to Hohtälli. This cable car and the newer 4-seat chairlift Sunnegga-Findeln-Breitboden provide connections between Sunnegga and Gornergrat. With few steep slopes, this mountain is often used to train younger skiers.

===Gornergrat===

The Gornergrat is served by the Gornergrat railway, a 29-minute ride to the Gornergrat peak (3,089 m), via Riffelalp, Rotenboden and Riffelberg, (with limited stops at Findelbach and Landtunnel just above Zermatt). At the summit, the hotel and restaurant have been refurbished and accommodate a shopping centre. Riffelalp station is linked to Riffelalp Resort by a short tramway line named Riffelalptram.

A cable car heads up from Hohtälli to the Rote Nase (3,247 m). This final lift serves a freeride area but can be unreliable as this mountainside requires good snow cover to be skiable. The lifts in this area generally open for the season in late February or early March – cablecar is now permanently closed, with no replacement lift planned. A new slope leading back from Hohtälli to Kellensee just under the Gornergrat replaced this lift to maintain the link from the Rothorn to Gornergrat.

===Klein Matterhorn / Schwarzsee===

Near the southern end of Zermatt, the Matterhorn Express gondola transports passengers up to the interchange station at Furi. From here there is access to Schwarzsee via a gondola to the right, a cable car that leads on to the Trockener Steg midstation (and then on to the Klein Matterhorn); and a new gondola, opened on 18 December 2006, links Furi to Riffelberg on the Gornergrat mountain. This lift addresses one of the most persistent criticisms of Zermatt: that it is very difficult to ski the two sides of the valley without a tiresome trek through Zermatt between the Gornergratbahn and the Matterhorn Express at opposite ends of the town.

Testa Grigia at the top of the Theodul Pass serves as a connection to the Italian ski-resorts of Cervinia and Valtournenche. From the Swiss side it is reachable by skilift only, but from the Italian side by a chairlift and by a cablecar. In March 2019 it was announced that a new lift – the &#x27;Alpine Crossing&#x27; – will connect Testa Grigia and Klein Matterhorn from spring 2021. There are customs offices here as well as a small alpine museum.

Zermatt is marketed as an all-year skiing resort, with summer skiing limited to the Theodul Glacier behind the Klein Matterhorn. Whilst strictly true, during the off season in May and June there will tend to be only one or two runs open, and the main glacier area does not open until July.

In operation since 25 October 2003, the Furggsattel six-seater chairlift has twelve (of eighteen) masts that stand directly on the glacial ice of the Theodul Glacier – a first for Switzerland.

The new CHF52 million 3S Glacier Ride Cable Car from the resort to Klein Matterhorn was opened on 29 September 2018. It has an uplift capacity of 2000 people per hour and takes just 9 minutes to reach the top using 25 cabins, each with 28 seats.

<text>The Brethren in Christ Church (BIC) is a River Brethren Christian denomination. Falling within the Anabaptist tradition of Christianity, the Brethren in Christ Church has roots in the Mennonite church, with influences from the revivals of Radical Pietism and the holiness movement. They have also been known as River Brethren and River Mennonites. The Canadian denomination, which formerly shared a name with its American counterpart, is now called Be In Christ.

==History ==
The Brethren in Christ have their headquarters in Pennsylvania. It loosely shares an early connection with the United Brethren back to 1767. The Brethren in Christ trace their denomination back to a group of Mennonites who lived just north of Marietta, Pennsylvania, on the east side of the Susquehanna River. As they met to study the Bible and to worship God in the 1770s, the people of this group who became known as the River Brethren searched early church history and developed a conviction that believer&#x27;s baptism by triune immersion was the scriptural form of baptism. The River Brethren of the 18th century also held to a firm reliance on the centrality of Jesus in Scripture, especially the literal application of the Sermon on the Mount, in Matthew 5-7.

Being Anabaptists, the River Brethren emphasized the beliefs of nonresistance and nonconformity to the world. Their origin in the Radical Pietistic revivals led the River Brethren to emphasize &quot;the conversion experience, a strong devotional life, and testimony.&quot; Jacob Engle is noted as one of the early leaders (sometimes considered the &quot;founder&quot; of the BIC Church). The first confessional statement of this group was formulated around 1780, after the stressful time of the American Revolution.

During the American Civil War, when required by the Union government of the United States to register as a body that held peaceful, non-combatant non-resistance values, the name &quot;Brethren in Christ&#x27;&quot; was adopted. &quot;River Brethren&quot; remained the term of popular usage into the 20th century for the American members of the denomination while &quot;Dunkers&quot; was the popular moniker given to the Canadian denomination members until the 1930s.

The denomination still holds strongly to its pursuit of peace, but within the denomination there are many different interpretations of how this peaceful lifestyle should be lived out. Many live out social pacifism, while others do not view Christ&#x27;s call to peace as an antiwar statement, but as a call to live peacefully on an interpersonal level. The history of the denomination is replete with stories of conscientious objection.

Other branches of the River Brethren include the Old Order River Brethren (org. 1843), the United Zion Church (org. 1855), and the Calvary Holiness Church. 

About the turn of the 20th century, the Brethren in Christ was influenced by the holiness movement.

Members of the Brethren in Christ Church founded Messiah College in 1909 (Grantham, Pennsylvania), and the Niagara Christian College (later Niagara Christian Community of Schools) in 1932 as a Christian preparatory school in Ontario, Canada.

==Beliefs==
The church&#x27;s current Articles of Faith and Doctrine were adopted in 1986 and emphasize the understanding of the inspired scriptures by the church in community with the illumination of the Holy Spirit, the &quot;centrality of Christ&quot; in the divine revelation, the necessity of holiness, nonviolence and the importance of community. The church believes that God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit reveals Himself through the divine record of scripture and that salvation through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ is received through the response of personal faith and repentance. Baptism by triune immersion and the Lord&#x27;s supper are considered ordinances of the church. Foot washing, the dedication of children, prayer for the sick, laying on of hands, and anointing with oil are important accepted practices but are not called ordinances.

A distinctive of the Brethren in Christ, together with other Anabaptist denominations, is the practice of &quot;Community Hermeneutics&quot; in which the interpretation of the scriptures is to be done by the church in community, rather than being the responsibility of the church hierarchy or that of the individual Christian.

==Status==
At the denomination&#x27;s 2006 General Conference, the Brethren in Christ Church in North America had about 295 churches in the United States and Canada. As of 2001, in the United States there were 20,739 members in 232 churches. Pennsylvania remains the hub of the denomination, with nearly half its congregations and a majority of its members. However, there are numerous congregations in other states, particularly Florida, Ohio, and California. Denominational headquarters is in Grantham, Pennsylvania, next to the Grantham BIC Church and Messiah University.

There are 1,100 churches in 23 countries with a worldwide membership of around 80,000. The BIC church maintains some connection to its Mennonite-influenced heritage by partnering in ministry with the Mennonite Central Committee.

The church organization is divided into seven regional conferences (each represented by a bishop who sits on the Leadership Council) and one subconference. The conferences are as follows: Allegheny, Atlantic, Great Lakes, Midwest, Pacific, Southeast, and Susquehanna; the subconference is centered around Miami, Florida, and focuses on Hispanic ministries. Messiah University in Grantham, and Niagara Christian Collegiate in Fort Erie, Ontario, Canada, are affiliated with the BIC.

The church is also has affiliations with a number of camps, conference centers, and ministries, as well as Evangel Publishing House in Nappanee, Indiana, and Christian Light Bookstores in Indiana, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Ohio.

===BIC Canada===
In 2012, the Canadian Conference of the Brethren in Christ and the General Conference of the Brethren in Christ recognized the advantage for both of being independent Churches. Both approved a separation affirmation. The result was the development of BIC Canada and the BIC in the USA. They continue to work collaboratively with each other and yet recognize their distinctive national identities and structures. In 2017, BIC Canada changed its name to &quot;Be in Christ Church of Canada.&quot;

Be In Christ Canada has three different expressions of churches: Community Churches, The Meeting House, and Reunion.

<text>&quot;Creeping Death&quot; is a song by American thrash metal band Metallica. It was released on November 23, 1984, as the lead and only commercial single from their album &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; (&quot;Fade to Black&quot; and &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;, from the same album, were issued as promotional singles). Written from the perspective of the Angel of Death, &quot;Creeping Death&quot; describes the tenth plague of Egypt. It is often thought of as one of the band’s most popular songs and is currently the second-most-played song live by them.

==Development==
Kirk Hammett wrote the guitar riff for the bridge section when he was 16 years old. The middle section, with its ominous chants of &quot;Die!&quot; set to a Phrygian mode chord progression, was originally written by Hammett while he was in Exodus. The song was called &quot;Die by His Hand&quot; and had been part of the Exodus setlist for live shows, but was never used on any Exodus albums.

Metallica was inspired for the song by the second half of the film &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;, which is based on the Bible tale of the Plagues of Egypt. While watching the scene of the final plague killing every Egyptian first-born child, Cliff Burton remarked &quot;Whoa – it&#x27;s like creeping death&quot;, as the plague was represented by a fog rolling into the Pharaoh&#x27;s palace. The band liked the sound of &quot;creeping death&quot; and decided to write a song about the plagues, with the phrase as its title.

The single release&#x27;s artwork was done by Alvin Petty. The logo and the song&#x27;s title were added with a plastic layover to the existing artwork. Kirk Hammett had seen the picture hanging up at Petty&#x27;s house and remarked that it would be perfect for the single and picture-disk that were about to be finished.

==Lyrics==

The song is told from the perspective of the &quot;Destroyer&quot;, the Angel of Death sent by God during the Tenth Plague of Egypt. Moses, through his older brother Aaron, insisted he was sent by God and repeatedly demanded that Pharaoh should set the Hebrew slaves free from Egypt to the promised land of Canaan. For the previous 400 years, the Hebrew people had lived as slaves in the Land of Goshen within Egypt. To punish Pharaoh for his obstinacy, God set ten plagues upon Egypt. The references to the plagues in the song include:

==Release==
The single was released through Music for Nations in the UK and France. The B-sides were the cover songs &quot;Am I Evil?&quot; (originally by Diamond Head) and &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot; (originally by Blitzkrieg). These covers are called &quot;Garage Days Revisited&quot; on the back cover; the 1987 EP &quot;The $5.98 E.P. - Garage Days Re-Revisited&quot; is a reference to this title. The B-sides were later included on the 1988 Elektra Records reissue of &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot; and the 1998 compilation album &quot;Garage Inc.&quot;.

==Reception==
It is ranked at #1 on &quot;Guitar World&quot; 10 greatest Metallica songs of all time. It was also voted by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; readers in 2014 as the sixth greatest Metallica song in the poll &quot;The 10 Best Metallica Songs&quot;.

<text>40 Eridani is a triple star system in the constellation of Eridanus, abbreviated 40 Eri. It has the Bayer designation Omicron2 Eridani, which is Latinized from ο2 Eridani and abbreviated Omicron2 Eri or ο2 Eri. Based on parallax measurements taken by the Gaia mission, it is about 16.3 light-years from the Sun.

The primary star of the system, designated 40 Eridani A and named Keid, is easily visible to the naked eye. It is orbited by a binary pair whose two components are designated 40 Eridani B and C, and which were discovered on January 31, 1783, by William Herschel. It was again observed by Friedrich Struve in 1825 and by Otto Struve in 1851.

In 1910, it was discovered that although component B was a faint star, it was white in color. This meant that it had to be a small star; in fact it was a white dwarf, the first discovered. Although it is neither the closest white dwarf, nor the brightest in the night sky, it is by far the easiest to observe; it is nearly three magnitudes brighter than Van Maanen&#x27;s Star, the nearest solitary white dwarf, and unlike the companions of Procyon and Sirius it is not swamped in the glare of a much brighter primary.

==Nomenclature==
40 Eridani is the system&#x27;s Flamsteed designation and ο² Eridani (Latinised to Omicron2 Eridani) its Bayer designation. The designations of the sub-components – B and C – derive from the convention used by the &quot;Washington Multiplicity Catalog&quot; (WMC) for multiple star systems, and adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). also bears the variable star designation DY Eridani.

The system bore the traditional name &quot;Keid&quot; derived from the Arabic word قيض () meaning &quot;the eggshells,&quot; alluding to its neighbour Beid (Arabic &quot;egg&quot;). In 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN)
to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN decided to attribute proper names to individual stars rather than entire multiple systems.
It approved the name &quot;Keid&quot; for the component on 12 September 2016 and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names.

==Properties==

40 Eridani A is a main-sequence dwarf of spectral type K1, 40 Eridani B is a 9th magnitude white dwarf of spectral type DA4, and 40 Eridani C is an 11th magnitude red dwarf flare star of spectral type M4.5e. When component B was a main-sequence star, it is thought to have been the most massive member of the system at , but ejected much of its mass before it became a white dwarf. B and C orbit each other approximately 400 AU from the primary star, A. Their orbit has a semimajor axis of 35 AU and is rather elliptical with an orbital eccentricity of 0.410.

As seen from the 40 Eridani system, the Sun is a 3.4-magnitude star in Hercules, near the border with Serpens Caput.

===Potential for life===
The habitable zone of where a planet could exist with liquid water, is near 0.68  from A. At this distance a planet would complete a revolution in 223 Earth days (according to the third of Kepler&#x27;s laws) and would appear nearly 20% wider than the Sun does on Earth. An observer on a planet in the system would see the B-C pair as unusually bright white and reddish-orange stars in the night sky – magnitudes −8 and −6, slightly brighter than the appearance of Venus seen from Earth as the evening star.

It is unlikely that habitable planets exist around because they would have been sterilized by its evolution into a white dwarf. As for , it is prone to flares, which cause large momentary increases in the emission of X-rays as well as visible light. This would be lethal to Earth-type life on planets near the flare star.

==Search for planets==
40 Eridani A shows periodic radial velocity variations, which were suggested to be caused by a planetary companion. The 42-day period is close to the stellar rotation period, which made the possible planetary nature of the signal difficult to confirm. A 2018 study found that most evidence supports a planetary origin for the signal, but this has remained controversial, with a 2021 study characterizing the signal as a false positive. As of 2022, the cause of the radial velocity variations remained inconclusive.

Further studies in 2023 and 2024 concluded that the radial velocity signal very likely does originate from stellar activity, and not from a planet.

The candidate planet would have had a minimum mass of , and lie considerably interior to the habitable zone, receiving nine times more stellar flux than Earth, which is an even greater amount than Mercury, the innermost planet in the Solar System, on average receives from the Sun.

==In fiction==
In the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, the planet Vulcan orbits 40 Eridani A. Vulcan has been referenced in relation to the real-life search for exoplanets in this system. The hypothetical planet 40 Eridani A b is also mentioned in the book &quot;Project Hail Mary&quot; as the home of the eponymous Eridian species. In the Bobiverse series by Dennis E. Taylor, a double planet is found orbiting 40 Eridani A, and named Vulcan and Romulus by an uploaded intelligence in a von Neumann probe.

<text>The Christian Mennonite Conference, formerly known as the Chortitzer Mennonite Conference (), is a small body of Mennonites in western Canada.

==History==

The forerunners of this group came to Manitoba from Russia in 1874. They were first known as Bergthalers, but eventually became known as &quot;the Chortitzer Church&quot; because their bishop, Gerhard Wiebe (1827–1900), lived near the village of Chortitz (now known as Randolph), and made the local church his home church. This group was very conservative. They sang without harmony (parts), restricting the singing to a melody only. They allowed neither Sunday schools nor evening services. The German language was used exclusively in church services. The bishop and ministers possessed most of the authority in the conference, allowing for little local autonomy.

The departure of the more conservative families to Paraguay in 1948 left the more progressive families remaining in Canada. This opened the way for a number of changes in the conference. A new emphasis was placed on Christian education, with the addition of Bible studies, Sunday school, Sunday evening services, and young people&#x27;s programs. Exclusive use of the German language made way for the adoption of English - first in Sunday School, and then in the Sunday morning services. A mission board was formed to conduct the mission outreach of the conference, and now a number of conference members serve in different parts of the world.

Today, the conference has just over 1,000 baptized members in 9 congregations. The bishop is the spiritual leader of the conference. Although all land and property is owned by the conference, each congregation is nearly autonomous and presides over its ministerial elections, spiritual matters, ministries, and budget. The bishop is responsible for the ordination of ministers and deacons. The conference, which has its main office in Steinbach, Manitoba, prints &quot;The Chronicle&quot; as its official publication and has a radio program ministry that ministers to German-speaking Mennonites in South America, Mexico, and Canada.

The conference officially changed its name to &quot;Christian Mennonite Conference&quot; in 2015.

<doc id="414052" wikidata="Q229996" url="?curid=414052" title="Jean M. Auel">
<text>Jean Marie Auel (; ; born February 18, 1936) is an American writer who wrote the &quot;Earth&#x27;s Children&quot; books, a series of novels set in prehistoric Europe that explores human activities during this time, and touches on the interactions of Cro-Magnon people with Neanderthals. Her books have sold more than 45 million copies worldwide.

==Early years==
Auel was born Jean Marie Untinen in 1936 in Chicago. She is of Finnish descent, the second of five children of Neil Solomon Untinen, a housepainter, and Martha (&quot;née&quot; Wirtanen) Untinen.

Auel attended the University of Portland. While a student, she joined Mensa and worked at Tektronix as a clerk (1965–1966), a circuit-board designer (1966–1973), a technical writer (1973–1974), and a credit manager (1974–1976). She earned an MBA from the University of Portland in 1976. She received honorary degrees from her alma mater, Pacific University, Portland State University, the University of Maine and the Mount Vernon College for Women.

==Career as novelist==
In 1977, Auel began extensive library research of the Ice Age for her first book. She joined a survival class to learn how to construct an ice cave, and learned primitive methods of making fire, tanning leather, and knapping stone from the aboriginal skills expert Jim Riggs.

&quot;The Clan of the Cave Bear&quot; was nominated for numerous literary awards, including an American Booksellers Association nomination for best first novel. It was also later adapted into a screenplay for the film of the same name.

After the sales success of her first book, Auel has been able to travel to the sites of prehistoric ruins and relics, and also to meet many of the experts with whom she had been corresponding. Her research has taken her across Europe from France to Ukraine, including most of what Marija Gimbutas called Old Europe. In 1986, she attended and co-sponsored a conference on modern human origins at the School of American Research, Santa Fe. She has developed a close friendship with Doctor Jean Clottes of France, who was responsible for the exploration and the scientific study of the Cosquer Cave discovered in 1985 and the Chauvet Cave discovered in 1994.

In October 2008, Auel was named an Officer of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Minister of Culture and Communication.

==Bibliography==
By 1990, Auel&#x27;s first three books in her &quot;Earth&#x27;s Children&quot; series had sold more than 20 million copies worldwide and been translated into 18 languages; Crown Publishers paid Auel about $25 million for the rights to publish &quot;The Plains of Passage&quot; and the two subsequent volumes. By May 2002, on the cusp of the publication of the fifth book, the series had sold 34 million books. The sixth and final book in the series, &quot;The Land of Painted Caves&quot;, was published in 2011.

<doc id="414057" wikidata="Q5981093" url="?curid=414057" title="Ian Callinan">
<text>Ian David Francis Callinan (born 1 September 1937) is a former Justice of the High Court of Australia, the highest court in the Australian court hierarchy.

==Education==
Born in Casino, New South Wales, Callinan was raised in Brisbane, Queensland, and educated at Brisbane Grammar School. He received a Bachelor of Laws from the University of Queensland while working as an articled clerk. On 23 July 2010, the University of Queensland awarded him a Doctorate of Laws (&quot;honoris causa&quot;) in recognition of his service to the law and the arts. In 2012, James Cook University awarded Callinan an Honorary Doctorate in Laws (honoris causa) in recognition of his service to the law.

==Pre-judicial career==
Callinan was admitted as a solicitor of the Supreme Court of Queensland in 1960 and a barrister in 1965. He was appointed as a Queen&#x27;s Counsel (QC) in 1978. He was President of the Queensland Bar Association between 1984 and 1987 and President of the Australian Bar Association between 1984 and 1985.

At the Bar he developed a broad national practice, appearing in cases concerning almost all areas of the law, including high-profile commercial law cases, industrial relations disputes, defamation trials, constitutional cases and criminal matters. He was briefed by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to prosecute a sitting High Court justice, Lionel Murphy, to appear in extradition proceedings against fugitive businessman Christopher Skase in both Spanish and Australian courts, and to prosecute the first &quot;bottom of the harbour&quot; tax fraud case, which was appealed to the High Court.

He also appeared for high-profile corporate and sporting personalities such as Alan Bond, Greg Chappell and Andrew Ettingshausen. While at the Bar he held retainers from some of Australia&#x27;s largest banks and media companies.

He advised the then Deputy Premier of Queensland, Bill Gunn to establish an inquiry into police corruption following the broadcast on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s (ABC) &quot;Four Corners&quot; program of a report entitled &quot;The Moonlight State&quot; which detailed extensive police corruption. He subsequently appeared for the Queensland Government in the Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct, more usually known as the Fitzgerald Inquiry.

Callinan was particularly noted for his work in defamation cases. He successfully defended what was then the longest civil jury trial in Australian legal history, when he appeared as leading counsel for Channel 9 in a 13-week defamation trial, in which Sir Leslie Thiess sought damages from Channel 9 following a report broadcast on that network that he had bribed the Premier of Queensland, Joh Bjelke-Petersen.

==Judicial activity==

Callinan was appointed as a Justice of the High Court in February 1998. He remained a Justice of the High Court until 1 September 2007, when he was compelled to retire under the provision which requires all Federal judges to retire upon attaining the age of 70. He was replaced by fellow Queenslander Susan Kiefel.

He is considered a strong defender of federalism. His judgments show a willingness to innovate in common law areas (for example in, tort and contract law cases), but a strong reluctance to depart from the original intent of the Constitution.

In constitutional cases Callinan expressed a clear preference for a restrained interpretation of the Constitution and for significant developments to be by way of referendum rather than judicial decision. That view was most trenchantly expressed in his lengthy dissent in &quot;New South Wales v Commonwealth&quot;, a case concerned with the constitutional validity of the Howard government&#x27;s WorkChoices legislation. Callinan&#x27;s judgment in that case is the longest in the history of the High Court, containing approximately 55,000 words and running for 165 pages.

Consistent with his restrained approach to constitutional interpretation and preference for democratic participation in constitutional alteration, Callinan expressed dissatisfaction with the High Court&#x27;s implied rights jurisprudence and, in particular, the Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation&quot; [1997] HCA 25, which confirmed an implied constitutional right to political communication. In &quot;Coleman v Power&quot; Callinan cast doubt on the constitutional foundation for the &quot;Lange&quot; implication, but did not need to decide whether it was correct in order to decide the case.

He has called for debate on a tort of interference with privacy in his judicial and extrajudicial writing. That call was first made in his reasons for judgment in &quot;Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd&quot;.

He set out his own views on how the law should respond to &#x27;rights of privacy&#x27; in an article published in the &quot;Oxford University Commonwealth Law Journal&quot; in 2007 entitled &quot;Privacy, Confidence, Celebrity and Spectacle&quot;, in which he called for the development of a tort of privacy and indicated a preference for tortious protection of privacy and image rather than the expansion of the equitable doctrine of breach of confidence.

While on the High Court he spoke out against the death penalty (which has been abolished in Australia), most notably in a speech to the 2005 Law Asia conference.
Callinan was described by Justice Susan Kenny of the Federal Court of Australia in article published in 2003 as &#x27;the leading&#x27; exponent of the &#x27;prudential ethical&#x27; method of constitutional adjudication during the 2002 term. Justice Kenny defined the &#x27;prudential ethical mode&#x27; as &#x27;a constitutional argument that relies on economic, social or political considerations attending the case ... a self-consciously evaluative style&#x27;.

Callinan&#x27;s broader legal philosophy was considered by Professor Michael Bryant in a 2008 article published in the &quot;University of Queensland Law Journal&quot;. Bryant concluded that in his judgments on private law, Callinan &#x27;showed a strong preference for achieving corrective justice, and a corresponding reluctance to take into account arguments based on considerations of distributive justice ... based on clearly held and expressed views on the proper limits of the appellate judicial role&#x27;.

==Post-judicial activities==

===Government inquiries===
Immediately upon his retirement from the High Court, Callinan was called back into public service through his appointment to conduct a Commission of Inquiry into the outbreak of equine influenza in Australia. His report was handed down in April 2008 and on 12 June 2008 the Commonwealth Government responded to the report, accepting all 38 of its recommendations and putting in place an implementation program.

On 11 October 2012, he was appointed by the Queensland Attorney-General to conduct a review of the Crime and Misconduct Commission.

On 20 August 2013, Callinan released a report commissioned by the Victorian Minister for Corrections and Minister for Crime Prevention, Edward O&#x27;Donohue, on the state of the parole system in Victoria. The report stated that the parole board frequently put the rights of prisoners ahead of community safety when issuing parole. As an example, Callinan used the Jill Meagher case, in which Adrian Bayley raped and murdered Meagher, to highlight the flaws within the system, stating that &quot;the Parole Board had both cause and opportunity to cancel Bayley&#x27;s parole&quot; prior to the incident.

In March 2015, the New Zealand Government chose Callinan to review once again David Bain&#x27;s claims for compensation for wrongful conviction and imprisonment after rejecting an earlier report by Canadian judge Ian Binnie. On 26 January 2016, Callinan&#x27;s report was delivered to New Zealand Justice Minister Amy Adams and on 2 August 2016, Adams formally announced that his finding was that Bain did not meet the threshold of &quot;innocent on the balance of probabilities&quot;.

In 2016, Callinan was appointed by the Deputy Premier of New South Wales Troy Grant MP to conduct a review of the effectiveness of the Sydney lockout laws, which restrict the sale of alcohol and the admission of patrons to some alcohol-serving venues. Callinan&#x27;s review was submitted to the Government on 13 September. As of October 2016, the recommendations were yet to be taken up by State Government.

===Private arbitrations and mediations===
Since leaving the High Court bench, Callinan has been appointed to arbitrate and mediate many disputes, including arbitrating claims by customers of the Commonwealth Bank 
arising out of the collapse of Storm Financial, mediating a dispute between a rebel Catholic parish and the Archbishop of Brisbane, mediating sexual assault claims involving the Catholic Diocese of Toowoomba and acting as global mediator of claims arising out of the collapse of the Westpoint Corporation.

In July 2014 he was appointed Chairman of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia&#x27;s Independent Review Panel for its Open Advice Review Program (OARP). The OARP was established by the Commonwealth Bank following a Senate Economics References Committee Inquiry into ASIC&#x27;s performance. The other Panel members are the Hon. Julie Dodds-Streeton and the Hon. Geoffrey Davies AO.

==International Court of Justice==
On 20 January 2014 Callinan became an ad hoc Judge of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for the proceeding &quot;Timor-Leste v Australia&quot; (The Case Concerning Questions relating to the Seizure and Detention of Certain Documents and Data), after being nominated by the Commonwealth of Australia. On the same day the ICJ commenced hearing a request by Timor-Leste for provisional measures of protection. On 3 March 2014, Callinan delivered a dissenting judgment on Timor-Leste&#x27;s application for provisional measures.

==Other activities==
While at the Bar, Callinan devoted much time to supporting the Arts in Queensland. He served on the board of many art galleries and was Chairman of Trustees of the Queensland Art Gallery and a trustee of the Brisbane Community Arts Centre and the Brisbane Civic Art Gallery Trust. He has also served as a member of the Council of the National Gallery of Australia.

Apart from his judicial writings he is a novelist (&quot;The Lawyer and the Libertine&quot;, &quot;The Missing Masterpiece&quot;, &quot;The Coroner&#x27;s Conscience&quot;, &quot;Appointment at Amalfi&quot;, &quot;After the Monsoon&quot;, &quot;The Russian Master&quot;, &quot;Betrayals&quot; and &quot;The Only Case&quot;) and a playwright (&quot;Brazilian Blue&quot;, &quot;The Cellophane Ceiling&quot;, &quot;The Acquisition&quot; and &quot;A Hero&#x27;s Funeral&quot;). He has also written short stories.

He served on the board of several public companies before being appointed to the bench and was also a board member of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Between 2000 and 2008 he was the Chairman of the Australian Defence Force Academy, Australia&#x27;s higher education institution for defence force personnel.

==Controversy==
Shortly after his appointment to the High Court, advice given by Callinan while he was at the Bar became the subject of a major Federal Court case, in which it was found that the advice given by Callinan had resulted in proceedings being filed that were an abuse of the Court&#x27;s process (White Industries v Flower &amp; Hart). Callinan was not a party to the proceedings, but was called as a witness. The trial judge (Goldberg J) made adverse findings against both Callinan&#x27;s instructing solicitors (who were the defendants to the proceedings) and Callinan. The trial judge referred the matter to the Commonwealth Attorney-General. The Attorney-General&#x27;s Office did not proceed with the matter.

==Honours==
In 2003, Justice Callinan was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) for his services to the law, arts and the community. He received the Centenary Medal in 2001 for his service as a Justice of the High Court of Australia. Justice Callinan is also a life member of the Queensland Bar Association and of the Australian Bar Association and an honorary Fellow of the Institute of Arbitrators and Mediators in Australia.

<text>Oxcarbazepine, sold under the brand name Trileptal among others, is a medication used to treat epilepsy. For epilepsy it is used for both focal seizures and generalized seizures. It has been used both alone and as add-on therapy in people with bipolar disorder who have had no success with other treatments. It is taken by mouth.
Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness, double vision and trouble with walking. Serious side effects may include anaphylaxis, liver problems, pancreatitis, suicide ideation, and an abnormal heart beat. While use during pregnancy may harm the baby, use may be less risky than having a seizure. Use is not recommended during breastfeeding. In those with an allergy to carbamazepine there is a 25% risk of problems with oxcarbazepine. How it works is not entirely clear.
Oxcarbazepine was patented in 1969 and came into medical use in 1990. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 167th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==

===Neurology===
Oxcarbazepine is an anticonvulsant used to reduce the occurrence of epileptic episodes, and is not intended to cure epilepsy. Oxcarbazepine is used alone or in combination with other medications for the treatment of focal (partial) seizures in adults. In pediatric populations, it can be used by itself for the treatment of partial seizures for children 4 years and older, or in combination with other medications for children 2 years and older. There is some evidence to support its effectiveness in reducing seizure frequency when used as an add-on therapy for drug-resistant focal epilepsy but there are concerns over tolerability.

===Psychiatry===
Oxcarbazepine (brand name Trileptal), has been historically used off-label by psychiatrists as a mood stabilizer. However, due to the limited data supporting efficacy it is typically reserved for patients for whom other medications have not worked or are contraindicated.

==Side effects==
Side effects are dose-dependent. The most common include dizziness, blurred or double vision, nystagmus, ataxia, fatigue, headaches, nausea, vomiting, sleepiness, difficulty in concentration, and mental sluggishness. The incidence of movement disorders appears to be lower compared to carbamazepine.

Other, rare, side effects of oxcarbazepine include severe low blood sodium (hyponatremia), anaphylaxis / angioedema, hypersensitivity (especially if experienced with carbamazepine), toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, and thoughts of suicide.

Measurement of serum sodium levels should be considered in maintenance treatment or if symptoms of hyponatremia develop. Low blood sodium is seen in 20–30% of people taking oxcarbazepine, and 8–12% of those experience severe hyponatremia. Some side effects, such as headaches, are more pronounced shortly after a dose is taken and tend to fade with time (60 to 90 minutes). Other side effects include stomach pain, tremor, rash, diarrhea, constipation, decreased appetite, and dry mouth. Photosensitivity is a potential side-effect and people could experience severe sunburns as a result of sun exposure.

Oxcarbazepine may lead to hypothyroxinemia. The well-known reduction in free and total thyroxine concentration may be due to both peripheral and central mechanisms.

== Pregnancy ==
Oxcarbazepine is pregnancy category C in the US. There is limited data supporting its safety in pregnancy. Several alternative medications with similar efficacy profiles provide significantly more robust data to support safety during pregnancy. However limited recent research shows similar rates of fetal malformations in exposed pregnancies to the general non-teratogen exposed population. Careful consideration of the risks, benefits, alternatives, and expert advise is needed when considering Oxcarbazepine use during pregnancy.

Historically Oxcarbazepine was considered to be teratogenic in humans due to animal studies which have shown increased fetal abnormalities in pregnant rats and rabbits exposed to oxcarbazepine during pregnancy. Additionally it&#x27;s similar structure of to carbamazepine, raised concern as it is teratogenic in humans (pregnancy category D). 

== Breastfeeding ==
Oxcarbazepine and its metabolite licarbazepine are both present in human breast milk and thus, some of the active drug can be transferred to a nursing infant. When considering whether to continue this medication in nursing mothers, the impact of the drug&#x27;s side effect profile on the infant should be weighed against its anti-epileptic benefit for the mother.

== Interactions ==
Oxcarbazepine, licarbazepine and many other common drugs influence each other through interaction with the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes. This leads to a cluster of dozens of common drugs interacting with one another to varying degrees, some of which are especially noteworthy.

Oxcarbazepine and licarbazepine are potent inhibitors of CYP2C19 and thus have the potential to increase plasma concentration of drugs, which are metabolized through this pathway. Other antiepileptics, which are CYP2C19 substrates and thus may be metabolised at a reduced rate when combined with oxcarbazepine, include diazepam, hexobarbital, mephenytoin, methylphenobarbital, nordazepam, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and primidone.

In addition, oxcarbazepine and licarbazepine are CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 inducers and thus have the potential to decrease the plasma concentration of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 substrates, including calcium channel antagonists against high blood pressure and oral contraceptives. However, whether the extent of CYP3A4/5 induction at therapeutic doses reaches clinical significance is unclear.

== Pharmacology ==
Oxcarbazepine is a prodrug, which is largely metabolized to its pharmacologically active 10-monohydroxy derivative licarbazepine (sometimes abbreviated &quot;MHD&quot;). Oxcarbazepine and MHD exert their action by blocking voltage-sensitive sodium channels, thus leading to the stabilization of hyper-excited neural membranes, suppression of repetitive neuronal firing and diminishment propagation of synaptic impulses. Furthermore, anticonvulsant effects of these compounds could be attributed to enhanced potassium conductance and modulation of high-voltage activated calcium channels.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
Oxcarbazepine has high bioavailability upon oral administration. In a study in humans, only 2% of oxcarbazepine remained unchanged, 70% were reduced to licarbazepine; the rest were minor metabolites. The half-life of oxcarbazepine is considered to be about 2 hours, whereas licarbazepine has a half-life of nine hours. Through its chemical difference to carbamazepine metabolic epoxidation is avoided, reducing hepatic risks. Licarbazepine is metabolised by conjugation with Glucuronic acid. Approximately 4% are oxidised to the inactive 10,11-dihydroxy derivative. Elimination is almost completely renal, with faeces accounting to less than 4%. 80% of the excreted substances are to be attributed to licarbazepine or its glucuronides.

=== Pharmacodynamics ===
Both oxcarbazepine and licarbazepine were found to show anticonvulsant properties in seizure models done on animals. These compounds had protective functions whenever tonic extension seizures were induced electrically, but such protection was less apparent whenever seizures were induced chemically. There was no observable tolerance during a four weeks course of treatment with daily administration of oxcarbazepine or licarbazepine in electroshock test on mice and rats. Most of the antiepileptic activity can be attributed to licarbazepine. Aside from its reduction in side effects, it is presumed to have the same main mechanism as carbamazepine, sodium channel inhibition, and is generally used to treat the same conditions.

=== Pharmacogenetics ===

The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele B*1502 has been associated with an increased incidence of Stevens–Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis in people treated with carbamazepine, and thus those treated with oxcarbazepine might have similar risks. People of Asian descent are more likely to carry this genetic variant, especially some Malaysian populations, Koreans (2%), Han Chinese (2–12%), Indians (6%), Thai (8%), and Philippines (15%). Therefore, it has been suggested to consider genetic testing in these people prior to initiation of treatment.

=== Structure ===
Oxcarbazepine is a structural derivative of carbamazepine, with a ketone in place of the carbon–carbon double bond on the dibenzazepine ring at the 10 position (10-keto). This difference helps reduce the impact on the liver of metabolizing the drug, and also prevents the serious forms of anemia or agranulocytosis occasionally associated with carbamazepine. Aside from this reduction in side effects, it is thought to have the same mechanism as carbamazepine — sodium channel inhibition (presumed to be the main mechanism of action) – and is generally used to treat the same conditions.

Oxcarbazepine is a prodrug which is activated to licarbazepine in the liver.

==History==

First made in 1966, it was patent-protected by Geigy in 1969 through . It was approved for use as an anticonvulsant in Denmark in 1990, Spain in 1993, Portugal in 1997, and eventually for all other EU countries in 1999. It was approved in the US in 2000. In September 2010, Novartis, of which Geigy are part of its corporate roots, pleaded guilty to marketing Trileptal for the unapproved uses of neuropathic pain and bipolar disorder.

== Research ==
Antiepileptics are a key pharmacological therapy used in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Research has investigated the use of oxcarbazepine as a mood stabilizer in bipolar disorder, with further evidence needed to fully assess its suitability. Oxcarbazepine used in conjunction with lithium has been shown to be effective in the maintenance phase.

It may be beneficial in trigeminal neuralgia.

<text>The Big Apple is both a partner dance and a circle dance that originated in the Afro-American community of the United States in the beginning of the 20th century.

==History==
=== Origin (1860–1936) ===
The exact origin of the Big Apple is unclear but one author suggests that the dance originated from the &quot;ring shout&quot;, a group dance associated with religious observances that was founded before 1860 by African Americans on plantations in South Carolina and Georgia. The ring shout is described as a dance with &quot;counterclockwise circling and high arm gestures&quot; that resembled the Big Apple. It is still practiced today in small populations of the southern United States. 

The dance that eventually became known as the Big Apple is speculated to have been created in the early 1930s by African-American youth dancing at the Big Apple Club, which was at the former House of Peace Synagogue on Park Street in Columbia, South Carolina. The synagogue was converted into a black juke joint called the &quot;Big Apple Night Club&quot;.

In 1936, three white students from the University of South Carolina – Billy Spivey, Donald Davis, and Harold &quot;Goo-Goo&quot; Wiles – heard the music coming from the juke joint as they were driving by. Even though it was very unusual for whites to go into a black club, the three asked the club&#x27;s owner, Frank &quot;Fat Sam&quot; Boyd, if they could enter. Skip Davis, the son of Donald Davis, said that &quot;Fat Sam made two conditions. They had to pay twenty five cents each and they had to sit in the balcony.&quot; During the next few months, the white students brought more friends to the night club to watch the black dancers. The white students became so fascinated with the dance that, in order to prevent the music from stopping, they would toss coins down to the black dancers below them when the dancers ran out of money. &quot;We had a lot of nickels with us because it took a nickel to play a song. If the music stopped and the people on the floor didn&#x27;t have any money, we didn&#x27;t get any more dancing. We had to feed the Nickelodeon&quot;, recalls Harold E. Ross, who often visited the club and was 18 years old at the time.

The white dancers eventually called the dance the black dancers did the &quot;Big Apple&quot;, after the night club where they first saw it. Ross commented that &quot;We always did the best we could to imitate the steps we saw. But we called it the Little Apple. We didn&#x27;t feel like we should copy the Big Apple, so we called it that.&quot;

=== Rise in popularity (1937–38) ===

During the summer of 1937, the students from the University of South Carolina started dancing the Big Apple at the Pavilion in Myrtle Beach. Betty Wood (née Henderson), a dancer who helped revive the Big Apple in the 1990s, first saw the dance there, and six months later she won a dance contest and become nicknamed &quot;Big Apple Betty.&quot; The news of the new dance craze spread to New York, and a New York talent agent, Gae Foster, traveled to the Carolinas to audition dancers for a show at the Roxy Theater, the world&#x27;s second-largest theater at that time. Eight couples were chosen for the show, including Wood, Spivey, and Davis, to perform the Big Apple during a three-week engagement that began on September 3, 1937. They performed six shows a day to sold-out audiences and greatly contributed to the dance&#x27;s popularity. After the engagement at the Roxy, the group became known as &quot;Billy Spivey&#x27;s Big Apple Dancers&quot; and toured the country for six months.

Arthur Murray, a dance instructor and entrepreneur who had 128 dance studios occupying three floors in New York in 1936 saw the Big Apple dancers at the Roxy in September 1937 and incorporated the Big Apple into his swing dance syllabus. Due to the popularity of the Big Apple and other popular dances such as the Conga, Murray began offering franchises in 1937. By 1938, there were franchises in several major cities, including Detroit, Cleveland, Atlanta, Louisville, and Minneapolis. The company continued to grow to over 200 Arthur Murray dance studios throughout the world by 2003.

In the fall of 1937, four couples from Whitey&#x27;s Lindy Hoppers, a Lindy Hop performance group based at the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem, New York, traveled to Hollywood, California, to perform a Lindy Hop sequence for a Judy Garland movie called &quot;Everybody Sing&quot; (1938). Soon after arriving in California, Herbert &quot;Whitey&quot; White, the manager for the group, sent a telegram to Frankie Manning, the lead dancer for the group, about the new dance craze in New York City called the Big Apple. Manning had never seen the dance before but based on the description of the dance in the telegram, he choreographed a Big Apple routine for the group. Since the dance was based on combining jazz steps that the Lindy hoppers were already familiar with, such as Truckin&#x27;, the Suzie-Q, and Boogies, the group quickly learned the new steps. They performed their Big Apple routine for &quot;Everybody Sing&quot;, but the dance scene was eventually cut due to a dispute between the director and Whitey over the dance group&#x27;s not receiving a break in the filming schedule.

When the group returned to Harlem, Manning taught his Big Apple version to other dancers in Whitey&#x27;s Lindy Hoppers, before ever having seen the version done by the Big Apple dancers at the Roxy. Whitey&#x27;s Lindy Hoppers would dance the Big Apple mixed with Lindy Hop at the Savoy Ballroom until interest in the dance died out. Later in 1939, the group performed a Big Apple sequence for the movie &quot;Keep Punching&quot;, which has been recreated by Lindy Hop performance groups since the 1990s.

By the end of 1937, the Big Apple had become a national dance craze. On December 20, 1937, &quot;Life&quot; featured the Big Apple in a four-page photo spread and the magazine predicted that 1937 would be remembered as the year of the Big Apple.

=== References in popular culture ===
The dance is mentioned in the Frank Capra film &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It with You&quot; (1938). In the film Jimmy Stewart and his fiancée, played by Jean Arthur, are enticed to learn the dance by some youngsters for the payment of a dime. The children have a sign &quot;Learn the &#x27;Big Apple&#x27; 10 cents.&quot; The lesson is broken up by the arrival of a policeman on foot. The children and the adults all leave. In the scene that follows, Mr. Stewart and Ms. Arthur show up at a swanky party not realizing that the sign has become attached to the back of Ms. Arthur&#x27;s dress.

In the movie &quot;Vivacious Lady&quot; (1938) Ginger Rogers and James Ellison teach some moves from the dance to Beulah Bondi. These include &quot;Suzie Q&quot; and &quot;Praise Allah&quot;. 

In the 1938 variety show anthology film &quot;The Big Broadcast of 1938&quot;, Bob Hope tells a joke about &quot;a little schoolboy that used to take a big apple to the teacher, and now he takes the teacher to the Big Apple.&quot; When the audience groans, he laughs lamely and says, &quot;The Big Apple&#x27;s a dance.&quot;

A notorious December 1937 radio broadcast by Mae West, condemned as &quot;vulgar and indecent&quot; by the Federal Communications Commission, featured an Adam and Eve sketch in which Eve (played by West) asks the Snake in the Garden of Eden to fetch her some forbidden fruit: &quot;Now, get me a big one -- I feel like doin&#x27; a Big Apple!&quot; The studio audience laughed, briefly applauding the reference.

=== Popularity continues ===
In the spring of 1938, Whitey&#x27;s Lindy Hoppers performed the Big Apple at the Roxy Theater during a three-week engagement. A theatrical producer, Harry Howard, saw their show and hired the group to perform for &quot;Hollywood Hotel Revue&quot;, a production that would tour New Zealand and Australia. The group was billed as &quot;The 8 Big Apple Dancers&quot; or similar variations, and consisted of four couples that included Frankie Manning. They were the only black performers in the production that lasted from August 1938 until spring 1939.

Some claim that New York City&#x27;s nickname, the Big Apple, came from the dance. However, that theory has been discredited (see The Nickname of New York).

There are also accounts that a new variation developed called the &quot;Little Apple.&quot; This form involved fewer dancers and people would take it in turns to grab a partner and move to the center of the circle and dance for a while in styles similar to the Lindy Hop, Shag, or other dances of the era.

=== Decline in popularity (1939–41) ===

The dance reached international popularity by 1939. Jeff Wilkinson claims that &quot;even British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was doing the dance.&quot; However, this may have been the dance&#x27;s undoing. Wilkinson speculates that the dance decreased in popularity when &quot;it was adopted by the old folks.&quot; Jitterbugging was also increasing in popularity, and by 1941 the Big Apple was a past fad that had been replaced by the Jitterbug

=== Revival (1980s–90s) ===

In the 1980s, Lance Benishek and Betty Wood started to tour the US and Europe teaching the Big Apple. The 50th anniversary of the dance was celebrated in 1988 in Columbia, South Carolina, the location where it all started.

==Related dances==
The Big Apple has many commonalities with Afro-American vernacular partner dances of the early part of the century through the 1930s and &#x27;40s. Dances such as the Cakewalk, Black Bottom, Charleston, and Lindy Hop share both similar elements and a common underlying improvisational spirit.

==Moves==
The moves are frequently used in Lindy Hop. This is also used as a warm up before Lindy Hop classes. Note that the moves are very 8-count centered, like tap dance. That is, they almost
all start on count 8. 

&quot;Susie Q Right&quot;: Both feet are placed together facing the center of the circle. Left hand clasps the right (think &quot;synergy&quot;), both heels scoot to the right, then both toes 4 slow, 8 quick. Typically &quot;reverse&quot; is then called and you go back the other way. 8 counts each way.

&quot;Susie Q left&quot;: this is the &#x27;Susie Q&#x27; that most Lindy Hoppers know. Left foot starts over right hand should be 90 degrees (like a forklift), palms down, wrists may pull hands up arms swing left to right. Twist left heel while right foot steps out and to the left, repeat. &quot;reverse&quot; goes the other way. Same timing as Susie Q right (slow, slow, slow, slow, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick).

&quot;Apple Jacks:&quot; With feet close together take tiny steps in place. When stepping with the right foot, let the right knee cross in front of the left knee, twisting hips to the left. With upper body bend down, with fingers pointed at the floor, twisting shoulders opposite hips. On the next step reverse the direction of knees, hips, shoulders. Each step is one count.

&quot;Break a Leg:&quot;

&quot;Break Step:&quot;

&quot;London Bridge:&quot;

&quot;Shout:&quot; Open arms wide.

&quot;Swivels:&quot; Swivels while walking.

&quot;Spank the Baby:&quot; Step out with left foot, bring right foot together, meanwhile raising the left arm in the air and making a spanking motion toward one&#x27;s own behind with the right hand. Spank the baby is done while walking in a circle (not around the circle).

&quot;Tick Tock:&quot; Put heels together with weight on the back of one foot and the front of the other, then shift toes together and the heels apart and alternate the weight on the feet and repeat the actions to create a sideways travelling motion while at the same time the forearms move in front of the torso then out to the sides in time with the shifting of the feet.

&quot;Truckin:&quot; Truckin is a shuffle step variation popularized after the vaudeville era. The right hand is held up (as in a right turn signal) with the index finger extended and wagging. In Harlem Truckin the shoulder is set back. Feet are parallel at all times. With both feet together and facing slight left the right foot scoopes down and brushes the floor, the left foot is then gathered at the right ankle and the right heel twists (this should cause forward movement as the foot scoopes past the other foot). The action is repeated creating a &quot;hearts in the snow&quot; effect from the overlapping steps. At the same time the left hand is placed over the stomach (like a waiter holding a towel) and never really moves. The stomach twistes with the feet therefore, the &quot;stomach rubs the hand&quot;. If truckin is being done around a circle the outside hand is always up.

&quot;Pose and Peck:&quot; Put hands on hips, and do pecking with head.

&quot;Scarecrow:&quot; First 4 counts are Charleston basic. Second 4 counts, put upper arms straight out to side, and let forearms dangle loosely, and tilt head to side. Often the feet are slightly apart, with the knees drooping together.

&quot;Shorty George:&quot; Named for George Snowden. Walk a straight line using very small steps. Keep upper body upright while dramatically bending knees. With each step, let the opposite knee push toward the back of the knee of the leading foot, causing both knees to shift right when stepping with right foot and shift left when stepping with left foot. Shoulders alternate, pushing down toward the leading foot, so that when the knees are pushed to the right, the right shoulder sinks downward and the left shoulder becomes raised. Each step is one count.

&quot;Little Peach:&quot; Touch the side of your nose twice, once with your left hand and once with your right.

&quot;Hitch Hike:&quot;

&quot;Boogie Back:&quot; Lean forward and bend knees. Clap hands on the even counts and hop backwards on the odd counts.

&quot;Boogie Forward:&quot; Straighten up and throw hands in the air. Each step starts from forward roll the hip, which then moves to the side and settles back as the step with the other foot begins. Each step is two counts.

&quot;Praises:&quot; The traditional ending the big apple. Everyone runs to the center of the circle and shouts &quot;Hallelujah&quot; while throwing hands in the air from a bent over posture. It may also be called just &quot;Hallelujah&quot;.

&quot;Rusty Dusty:&quot; Hold pant legs up and shake the dust out of them.

&quot;Charleston:&quot; See solo Charleston moves. This move is actually called &quot;Big apple swing&quot;. 

&quot;Fall Off the Log:&quot; Kick right leg to the side, then step behind with your right foot, out with your left foot, and in place with your right foot. Repeat this on the left side.

<text>The Missionary Church is an evangelical Christian denomination of Anabaptist origins with Wesleyan and Pietist influences.

==Faith and practice==
The Missionary Church is a Trinitarian body which believes the Bible is the inspired Word of God and authoritative in all matters of faith; that &quot;salvation is the result of genuine repentance of sin and faith in the atoning work of Christ&quot;; and that the &quot;church is composed of all believers in the Lord Jesus who have been vitally united by faith to Christ&quot;. They hold two Christian ordinances, baptism by immersion and the Lord&#x27;s Supper, as outward signs, not a means of salvation.

==History==
The Missionary Church has diverse roots, especially in Anabaptism (directly through the Mennonites), German Pietism, the holiness movement, and American evangelicalism, (and to a smaller degree fundamentalism and Pentecostalism). The preamble to their Constitution references this by stating:
:&quot;...the Missionary Church will be better understood by the reader who recognizes that a singular commitment of our early leaders was to the position that the Scriptures were to be the primary source of doctrine and life. In addition to this commitment to be a biblical church, we recognize the contribution of John Wesley&#x27;s emphasis on &quot;the warmed heart&quot;; A.B. Simpson&#x27;s fourfold emphasis on Jesus Christ as Savior, Sanctifier, Healer and Coming King; the Anabaptist concepts of community and brotherhood; the evangelical emphases of the lost estate of mankind and redemption through Jesus Christ. The Missionary Church, then, is a unique blend of the thought and life of a people who have sought to build their church according to Scriptures and who have appreciated their historical roots.&quot;

In the late 19th century, several Mennonite preachers embraced pietism and revivalism, and were excluded from their conferences. Among the leaders were Solomon Eby (1834–1929) of Ontario, William Gehman (1827–1917) of Pennsylvania, Daniel Brenneman (1834–1919) of Indiana, and Joseph E. Ramseyer (1869–1944). These brethren gradually found one another and their movements merged. Daniel Brenneman and Solomon Eby established the Reformed Mennonites in 1874. The Reformed Mennonites joined with some other expelled Mennonite members (called the New Mennonites) and formed the United Mennonites. In 1879 the followers of William Gehman (called Evangelical Mennonites) merged with the United Mennonites, creating the Evangelical United Mennonites. In 1883 a group from Ohio (called Brethren in Christ or Swankites) joined the movement. The denomination became the Mennonite Brethren in Christ on December 29, 1883, in Englewood, Ohio. The Mennonite Brethren in Christ changed their name to the United Missionary Church in 1947. The Mennonite Brethren in Christ Pennsylvania Conference disliked the name change and received permission to maintain their existing name. In 1952, the Pennsylvania Conference voted to secede from the United Missionary Church, and, in 1959, it would rename itself the Bible Fellowship Church.

The Missionary Church Association was founded in Berne, Indiana, in 1898. In that year, Joseph E. Ramseyer was excluded from the Égly Amish because he was rebaptized at a revival meeting. The Égly Amish rejected both the nature of the baptism (immersion) and its non-Amish and Mennonite connections (he had already been baptized by the Égly Amish). The Missionary Church Association and the United Missionary Church (formerly the Mennonite Brethren in Christ) carried on fraternal relations for many years, and then merged in 1969 to form the Missionary Church.

==Branches==
The Missionary Church (and the movements that formed it) has experienced three divisions — the withdrawal of several leaders from the Missionary Church Association in 1923 over disagreements concerning the Holy Spirit; in 1947 the Pennsylvania Conference of the Mennonite Brethren in Christ withdrew over issues of doctrine and polity, and in 1959 became the Bible Fellowship Church; and the Missionary Church of Canada withdrew from the Missionary Church in 1987 (and merged with the Evangelical Church of Canada in 1993 to form the Evangelical Missionary Church). The first two divisions occurred because of doctrinal differences, while the third was a friendly separation in response to legal issues pertaining to the church existing in two nations, the United States and Canada.

==Status==
As of 2020, in the United States there were 463 congregations. Indiana remains the geographic center of the denomination, with nearly half of its members. Ohio and Michigan also contain sizable numbers of members.

The organization of the church is divided into 11 regions or districts (and 5 mission regions). Offices are located in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Its ministries include World Partners USA, the Missionary Church Investment Foundation, U.S. Ministries, the Pastoral leadership institute (PLI), and Bethel University. Bethel University (Indiana), located in Mishawaka, Indiana, currently has about 1,350 students.

Also, the Missionary Church Historical Society (founded in 1979) located at Bethel University was established to maintain and keep historical records. 

&quot;The archives of the Missionary Church, as the memory center for records of historical significance, is a collection of the official papers of the denomination as well as materials relating to its origin and development. Its task is to organize and preserve these materials so they may be a valuable resource for reference and research.&quot;

In recent years, the Missionary Church has sought a closer return to its Mennonite roots. In 2003, the Church of the United Brethren in Christ, another body with Mennonite and Pietist heritage, began pursuing an attempt to join their 200-some churches in the United States with the Missionary Church. The leadership of both denominations were firmly behind this. However, United Brethren members in the United States voted against the idea 56% to 44%, thereby halting the discussions. 

The Missionary Church is a member of the National Association of Evangelicals.

<doc id="414065" wikidata="Q1549149" url="?curid=414065" title="Lower gastrointestinal series">
<text>A lower gastrointestinal series is a medical procedure used to examine and diagnose problems with the human colon of the large intestine. Radiographs (X-ray pictures) are taken while barium sulfate, a radiocontrast agent, fills the colon via an enema through the rectum.

The term barium enema usually refers to a lower gastrointestinal series, although enteroclysis (an upper gastrointestinal series) is often called a small bowel barium enema.

==Purpose==
For any suspected large bowel disease, colonoscopy is the investigation of choice because tissue sample can be taken for investigation. Virtual colonoscopy (also known as CT colonography) is another preferred investigation, provided that facilities and expertise are available. Virtual colonoscopy also avoids the risk of total blockage of any stricture in the large bowel due to barium impaction. Some conditions are absolutely contraindicated for barium enema namely: toxic megacolon, pseudomembranous colitis, and recent history rigid endoscopy of the large bowel in the past five days and recent history of flexible endoscopy in the past 24 hours. This is because, rigid endoscopy tends to use larger biopsy forceps to take tissue samples from the bowel wall while flexible endoscopy uses small biopsy forceps to take superficial samples. For those with incomplete bowel preparation, the subject can return the next day or the day after next to repeat the procedure. If barium meal was performed recently, then it is advised to wait for another seven to ten days before repeating the procedure. Some frail subject may not be suitable for barium meal.

Barium enemas are most commonly used to check bowel health; they can help diagnose and evaluate the extent of inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn&#x27;s disease. Polyps can be seen, though not removed during the exam like with a colonoscopy—they may be cancerous. Other problems such as diverticulosis (small pouches formed on the colon wall that can become inflamed) and intussusception can be found (and in certain cases the test itself can treat intussusception). An acute appendicitis or twisted loop of the bowel may also be seen. If the picture is normal a functional cause such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may be considered.

In a healthy colon, barium should fill the colon uniformly and show normal bowel contour, patency (should be freely open), and position.

Additional conditions under which the test may be performed:
* CMV gastroenteritis/colitis
* Hirschsprung&#x27;s disease
* intestinal obstruction
* intussusception (children)

==Procedure==

Barium enema can be done in two ways, namely double contrast and single contrast methods. Double contrast (where air is inflated into the bowel after excess barium are drained through anus) is useful in visualising mucosal pattern. For single contrast study (whole bowel is filled up with barium without inflating any air), it is used to visualise any obstruction in the large bowel, and it is used in children where visualisation of mucosal pattern is not needed. Barium enema is also used to reduce an intussusception where this disorder is more commonly found in children. 500 ml of Polibar 150% (barium sulfate suspension) is used to perform this study. Subject should be fasted and Picolax (sodium picosulfate) is taken orally to empty the bowels before barium enema procedure.

This test may be done in a hospital or clinic. The individual lies on the X-ray table and a preliminary X-ray is taken. The individual is then asked to lie on their side while a well lubricated enema tube is inserted into the rectum. As the enema enters the body, the individual might have the sensation that they need to have a bowel movement. The barium sulfate, a radiodense (shows as white on X-ray) contrast medium, flows through the rectum into the colon. A large balloon at the tip of the enema tube may be inflated to help keep the barium sulfate inside. The flow of the barium sulfate is monitored by the health care provider on an X-ray fluoroscope screen (like a TV monitor). Air may be puffed into the colon to distend it and provide better images (often called a &quot;double-contrast&quot; exam). If air is used, the enema tube will be reinserted if it had been removed and a small amount of air will be introduced into the colon, and more X-ray pictures are taken.

The individual is usually asked to move to different positions and the table is slightly tipped to get different views.

If there is a suspected bowel perforation, a water-soluble contrast agent (such as diatrizoate) is used instead of barium. The procedure is otherwise very similar, although the images will be of poorer quality. If a perforation exists, the contrast will leak from the bowel to the peritoneal cavity; water-soluble material is less obscuring compared to barium should an abdominal incision to remove the contrast be necessary.

===Radiographic views===
Assume that the x-ray tube is moving above the table and the x-ray film is moving below the table (overcouch):
The subject lying supine to give AP (anteroposterior) view of all the bowels.
Left lateral view of rectum is to view the rectum from lateral position.
Right anterior oblique (RAO) position is to view the caecum, ascending colon, right hepatic flexure and sigmoid colon without overlapping of other bowels.
Left anterior oblique (LAO) position is to view the splenic flexure without overlapping of other bowels.
Left posterior oblique (LPO) position is to view the sigmoid colon without overlapping of other bowels.
Hampton&#x27;s view (prone caudal view) of rectosigmoid colon is taken when the subject is in prone position with the X-ray tube tilted towards the feet at 30 degrees. This is to separate out the loops of sigmoid colon.

Other views include right and left decubitus views

==Risks==
X-rays are monitored and regulated to provide the minimum amount of radiation exposure needed to produce the image. Most experts feel that the risk is low compared with the benefits. Pregnant women and children are more sensitive to the risks of ionizing radiation.

A more serious risk is a bowel perforation.

==Special considerations==
CT scans and ultrasounds are now the tests of choice for the initial evaluation of abdominal masses, and colonoscopies are becoming the standard for routine colon screening for those over age 50 or with a familial history of polyps or colon cancer, although it is not uncommon for a barium enema to be done after a colonoscopy for further evaluation.

<text>Pierre du Calvet (1735 – March 28, 1786) was a Montreal trader, justice of the peace, political prisoner and epistle writer of French Huguenot origin.

==Biography==

===Family===
Pierre du Calvet was born in the Summer of 1735 in Caussade in the French province of Guyenne (today the Tarn-et-Garonne &quot;département&quot;). He was the oldest of a family of five children. His father, Pierre Calvet, of Calvinist confession, had his children baptized as Catholics. He however passed on his Protestant faith to them. His mother was Anne Boudet. His family is said to be of noble origin and owned a domain at Montalzat, north of Toulouse.

An ancestor, François Calvet, was hanged on June 23, 1563, for introducing the Reform in Montauban.

===Education===
He received a Catholic education without renouncing his Calvinism. Judging from his writings, he certainly studied the Humanities, French law, the Law of Nations and the philosophy of his time, that of the Enlightenment. In the main epistle of his &quot;Appel à la Justice de l&#x27;État&quot;, he quotes long excerpts from Pufendorf, Gratian, Grotius, Locke and Machiavelli.

===Emigration to New France===
A cousin-in-law, Mr. Guireaud, provided him with the capital needed to purchase the goods he intended to trade in New France. Du Calvet thus embarked for Quebec City on board the merchant ship &quot;Le Lion&quot;, which left Bordeaux in April 1758. His boat was shipwrecked about 100 miles from Quebec. His cargo lost, he was forced to find employment on his arrival in the capital of Canada towards mid-June.

On behalf of the government of New France, he was store keeper at Miramichi and Restigouche in Acadia. He was responsible to provide for the needs of three to four thousand Acadians deported by the British government in 1755. He remained there until autumn 1759.

In the summer of 1759, he took part to a mission to transfer British war prisoners to Halifax under officer Jean-François Bourdon de Dombourg. Lieutenant William Caesar McCormick, who was a prisoner captured in the Petitcodiac River Campaign, wrote him a letter of appreciation dated August 28 for the good care given to all the prisoners. On September 10, he was also given a certificate recognizing the humane treatment of the said prisoners.

Du Calvet thereafter left for Montreal after having learned, while passing through Quebec City, that the Vaudreuil government had removed there following the city&#x27;s capitulation. He remained in Montreal until January 1760.

He was again charged with a mission in Acadia, this time to perform a population census on the Acadians and determine ways to provide assistance to them. He left Montreal on January 18, at the head of a group of some 60 Acadians and a few Amerindian guides. With him was the commander in chief of French Acadia, Mr. Boishébert. Upon his return, he was almost immediately sent to Sainte-Foy for the last important battle between the French and British Armies before the capitulation and surrender of Montreal on September 8. He left for Quebec City on April 20, accompanying the expedition commanded by de Lévis. In a letter to his father date June 28, du Cavet recites the historic battle and the subsequent siege. The siege was lift up on May 16, and du Calvet returned to Montreal with everyone else still alive.

Following the capitulation of the government of New France on September 8, 1760, he remained in Montreal. During the winter, he met with William Caesar McCormick again and was recommended to General Jeffery Amherst by him. Du Calvet, was determined to return to Europe and consequently was in need to get to Quebec to obtain a passport from governor James Murray, not without first obtaining another passport from governor Thomas Gage to be authorized to leave the district of Montreal. Governor Murray however requested that du Calvet delays his departure to go on yet another mission in Acadia. His task was to count the number of Acadians still left in Acadia and offer them to be transported safely to Quebec. This last humanitarian mission, which he accepted, kept him busy from July to October 1761. It seems he abandoned his project to return to Europe afterward because in January 1762, he was in Montreal.

===Trader and Justice of the Peace===
In January 1762, he settled in Montreal where he finally started his import-export business. He exported corn and peltries which he loaded aboard the trading vessels of the &quot;Watson &amp; Rashleigh&quot; company (Brook Watson and Robert Rashleigh) bound for England and Spain. In return he imported various goods from Europe such as spirits and products for domestic use. His trade was prosperous. Between 1772 and 1776, he exported approximately 35,000 &quot;minots&quot; of corn, 800 pea &quot;minots&quot; plus some peltries, and imported great quantities of goods which he sold off in the district of Montreal. On March 3, 1774, he purchased the seigniory of Rivière-David, close to Sorel.

In 1763, he learned of the death of one of his uncles living in South Carolina and two months later that of his father in France.

In the summer of 1764, he left the province of Quebec for London from where he dealt with the succession of his uncle. He then passed to France to sell the family domain of Montalzat. He only came back to Montreal in June 1766. During his absence, Jean Dumas-Saint-Martin and Pierre Jusseaume dit Saint-Pierre conducted his private affairs in America. During this long voyage in Europe, he made several contacts in the English-speaking world. Even if his English was defective, he was well received a little everywhere, helped as he was with invaluable letters of introductions from governor Murray. Amongst others, he met the governor&#x27;s brother, Lord Elibank, who resided at Greenock in Scotland. In London, he met with George Montagu-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax, British Secretary of State for the Southern Department.

In Paris, he landed with letters of introductions for Francis Seymour-Conway, 1st Marquess of Hertford, the British Ambassador to France and his secretary, David Hume, the already famous philosopher, who both interceded in his favour before the Comte de Saint-Florentin. All this support was necessary for him to ensure the liquidation of his succession because he was Protestant and the French laws were then unfavourable to non-Catholics. In January 1766, after a year-long sojourn, the business was over with and he went back to London. In the Spring, he embarked for Quebec on board a vessel named the &quot;General Conway&quot;.

On June 23, 1766, governor Murray appointed him Justice of the Peace at the new Court of Common Pleas for the district of Montreal. Hardly just returned, he again left Canada, in November, to deal with trade matters in England, and only returned home in April 1767, called by his duty of Justice of the Peace.

Du Calvet seemed to have put a great zeal in the exercise of his public duties and was soon praised by the Chief Justice the province, William Hey. He handled a very great number of causes and did not ask for any fees at all.

===Marriage===
On October 3, 1771, at 36 years of age, he married Marie-Louise Jusseaume. 20 years old, she was the daughter of his friend Pierre Jusseaume and Marie-Louise Boulay-dit-Boulet. The new couple settled in a city house at the corner of Saint-Paul and Bonsecours streets. A first child, a boy, was born July 7, 1772. The small Jean-Pierre died in early age on the coming August 31. On November 8, 1773, Marie-Louise gave birth to a second boy, whom they name Jean Dumas, in honour of the child&#x27;s godfather Jean Dumas Saint-Pierre. The couple had a third boy on October 16, 1774. He was named Guy, in honour of governor Guy Carleton. Sadly, this last child died on May 11, having had one too difficult winter. The mother joined her first and her last in the tomb in December of the same year.

Du Calvet found a nurse, dame La Prise, to take care of Jean Dumas, his second son.

===Political engagement===
In 1769, he submitted a reform plan to the new governor Guy Carleton which aimed for the uniformisation of the administration of justice in the province of Quebec. The new administrative measures promulgated on February 1 did not satisfy him and he continued to voice for reform thereafter. He wrote a few open letters which he published in the &quot;Quebec Gazette&quot;/&quot;Gazette de Québec&quot;, the only newspaper in the colony at the time.

On October 28, 1770, he submitted the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Wills Hill, Earl of Hillsborough, a memoir entitled &quot;Mémoire sur la forme judiciaire actuelle de la Province de Québec&quot;.

His public denunciation of the abuses of justice by certain judges among his colleagues attracted him both friends and enemies. His actions for the improvement of the system and administration of justice were praised by Governor Carleton, attorney general Francis Maseres and Chief Justice William Hey. He however was placed at odds with a few fellow-members in the magistracy, including his neighbour John Fraser, as well as Edward Southouse and René-Ovide Hertel de Rouville.

John Fraser, captain of 60th British Royal Regiment, became Justice of the Peace in 1765, shortly after being released, for lack of evidence, in a case of violence involving him and merchant Thomas Walker, friend of du Calvet, who on September 6, 1764, lost an ear during an assault on his person. According to du Calvet, John Fraser entertained animosity towards him from this period. On June 29, 1771, Fraser and du Calvet engaged in a fist fight in front of du Calvet&#x27;s house, that is opposite that of Fraser.

===American Revolutionary War===
On October 26, the first Continental Congress addressed a letter to the inhabitants of the province in which the form of government given to the people by the &quot;Quebec Act&quot; was severely criticized. The people were invited to give themselves the provincial representation the &quot;Quebec Act&quot; did not provide for, and have this representative body send delegates to the upcoming continental Congress, to be held in Philadelphia on May 10, 1775.

In the climate of high suspicion that precedes the entry of the Congress&#x27;s army on the territory of the province of Quebec, many citizens were arrested and among them was du Calvet. Joseph Simon Léonard, officer of militia at Pointe-aux-Trembles, accused du Calvet of collaboration with the &quot;rebels&quot;. On October 6, his case was heard before the court and on October 9 a jury rejected the accusation as unfounded.

On November 13, Montreal was taken by the army of Brigadier General Richard Montgomery without a fight. Du Calvet was part of a committee of citizens who greeted the representatives of the Continental Congress with an address, written by Valentin Jautard on November 14. During the 6-month long occupation of Montreal by the Congress&#x27; armies, du Calvet&#x27;s stores were under requisition for the service of the army.

On May 6, British reinforcements commanded by John Burgoyne arrived at Quebec. The Congress&#x27; troops were defeated at Trois-Rivières on June 8, and on June 15, Benedict Arnold withdrew his men from the province of Quebec. Before leaving the country, the army of the Congress had delivered du Calvet promissory notes of reimbursement which he later used to claim back 56,394 pounds to the Congress.

Frederick Haldimand was appointed to replace Guy Carleton in the spring of 1777 and landed in the province&#x27;s capital on June 26, 1778. A month before, Fleury Mesplet had founded the first newspaper of Montreal and the first French-only one in the history of Quebec as well. Pierre du Calvet continued his public denunciation of the administration of justice by publishing open letters in it.

On May 26, he published an open denunciation of his colleagues Edward Southouse and René-Ovide Hertel de Rouville. James Monk, the attorney general, sued du Calvet for libel. He was defended by lawyer William Dummer Powell and acquitted by a jury declaring no grounds for the accusation.

===Political prisoner===
On September 27, 1780, brigadier general Allan Maclean proceeded to arrest du Calvet. He was incarcerated during three years, from September 27, 1780, to May 2, 1783. From the first day of his arrest, he never ceased to claim his innocence and requested that a legal trial be given to him.

On December 6, 1780, a little over a month after his arrest, governor Haldimand accepted the request for the release of du Calvet which legislative councillor François Lévesque had submitted him. The Governor however changed his mind the day after.

On May 2, 1783, he was finally released from prison.

===&quot;Appel à la Justice de l&#x27;État&quot; and death===
Out of prison, du Calvet left the continent for London where he intended to put governor Haldimand to trial for violating the British constitution.

In March 1784, he published &quot;The Case of Peter du Calvet&quot; to let his cause be known to the English public. Not conversant in the English language, he received the help of Francis Maseres and Petier Livius to write the document, which contains a detailed account of his confrontation with judge Fraser, his arrest, sequestration, his numerous letters asking to be trialled before a jury of his peers, etc.

In July, he published &quot;Appel à la Justice de l&#x27;État&quot;, a collection of letters to British officials and to the people of Quebec, intended to inform them of his actions to obtain both justice in his personal cause and a new constitution for the province.

The same year, Félix de Berey, mocked by du Calvet in one of his open letters, published &quot;Réplique par le P. de Berey aux calomnies de Pierre du Calvet&quot;.

To finance his lawsuit against Haldimand, he needed money. While in London he decided to cross the Atlantic to reach Philadelphia and recover the money owed to him by the American Congress. He presented himself before the Congressmen to claim the amount he believed was his, but was paid back only parts of it. On March 3, the Spanish ship transporting him to Paris left the port of New York. On March 15, the Spanish ship was declared lost in sea.

==Political heritage==
While the trial of Haldimand never took place, the actions taken by du Calvet had a decisive influence on the course of Quebec&#x27;s history. He undoubtedly contributed to the involvement of citizens, French-speaking and English-speaking, Catholic and Protestant, in a common effort to obtain a House of Assembly for the province of Quebec. Indeed, a few months after the probable arrival of the first copies of his collection of letters, numerous persons were signing the &quot;Petition of Ancient and New Subjects for a House of Assembly&quot; dated November 24, 1784.

Louis-Joseph Papineau evoked his memory in his last public speech at the Institut canadien de Montréal in December 1867. Like numerous others of his generation, he knew the story of du Calvet.

In 1877, Louis Fréchette dedicated a poem entitled &quot;Du Calvet&quot; in his collection of poems &quot;La Légende d&#x27;un peuple&quot;. Relating in verse the story of his fight, he made him a national hero, the &quot;first champion of our civic battles&quot;.

Éva Circé-Côté dedicated chapter V of her book &quot;Papineau - Son influence sur la pensée canadienne&quot; to &quot;the one who inaugurated the most glorious period of our annals&quot;.

<doc id="414069" wikidata="Q7084673" url="?curid=414069" title="Old Order River Brethren">
<text>The Old Order River Brethren, formerly sometimes known as York Brethren or Yorkers, are a River Brethren denomination of Anabaptist Christianity with roots in the Radical Pietist movement. As their name indicates, they are Old Order Anabaptists.

== History ==
The denomination began about 1778 in Pennsylvania. They share their early history with the Brethren in Christ Church. A group of brethren living near the Susquehanna River, who had previously separated from the Mennonites fellowshiped with German Baptist Brethren but eventually became known as the River Brethren. In 1856, there was a three-way split among the &quot;River Brethren&quot; and these folks established a separate, more conservative group.

They were sometimes referred to as the York Brethren, or Yorkers, because most of the members in 1843 were located in York County, Pennsylvania. This group believed the majority of the River Brethren churches were becoming too lax in their standard of Biblical non-conformity and non-resistance, and desired to return to older Scriptural doctrines and traditions. With the increase of more progressive and modernizing groups in Christendom following the industrial revolution, and the emergence of clarifying naming of other traditional Old Order groups among the plain people such as Amish (Old Order Amish forming 1862–1878), the Mennonites (Old Order Mennonites, 1872–1901) and the German Baptist Brethren (Old German Baptist Brethren 1882) in the late 1800s they defined themselves also as &quot;Old Order&quot;.

Between 1921 and 1961 four splits occurred in the group, mostly regarding the use of cars, leaving the Old Order River Brethren divided into five subgroups. Three of the five groups reunited between 1969 and 1977 so that there are three subgroups currently.

== Religious practice ==
Traditionally meetings for worship are held in the homes and barns of the members. In recent times, meetinghouses and public buildings are sometimes used for church services. Ministers are un-salaried, with no formal training for preachers. Ministers are chosen from among the godly men of the congregation who fulfil the Scriptural description of church leaders in 1 Timothy 3.1–13, and Titus 1.5 – 3.11. A congregation traditionally has a bishop, two ministers, and one or two deacons.

Testimonies are an integral part of every worship service, which opens by allowing all members, male and female to share personal testimonies, answers to prayer, or songs. There is no separate Sunday School, but all members learn, worship and study the Bible together.

The weekend long Lovefeast observance of Communion is practiced which includes preaching, singing, self examination, communal meals, and foot washing.

Believer&#x27;s Baptism is practiced after conversion, most often during the teen years. Baptism is by trine immersion in the name of the Father, the name of the Son, and the name of the Holy Spirit, in natural, outdoor water (often a pond, a river or a stream), as with other plain Brethren. Outdoor baptism is practiced regardless of weather.

Old Order River Brethren wear a conservative form of plain dress. Male members wear beards usually without moustaches, long pants usually of dark colors and often with suspenders, and wear button up shirts with sleeves. Female members wear opaque white cotton head coverings along with long cape dresses in solid cloth, or very small print. The women&#x27;s dress has a Mennonite type or attached cape on front, and a Brethren style, or loose cape back. As among many other plain groups, they do not require their children to dress according to the church member dress pattern until conversion, baptism and church membership; which is usually in their teens or 20s. Prior to this, children and youth wear modest, gender appropriate clothing.

In 1919 the Old Order River Brethren forbade the use of automobiles and thus the use of horse-drawn vehicles was generally maintained until the Musser group allowed cars in 1951 and the Strickler group in 1954. A third smaller and shrinking subgroup, called the &quot;Old Church&quot;, still uses horse and buggy transportation.

Television is not allowed, but electricity, telephones and limited internet are accepted. Members who feel called to a certain occupation which requires college education are not uncommon, but most of these are in service-oriented occupations, such as medical and dental training. This is seen as continuing the ministry which Jesus had among the sick and needy, when He walked on earth.

During the 20th century the Pennsylvania German was replaced by English, which has been used exclusively in services since about the 1940s. Only a few members still spoke the Pennsylvania German of their ancestors by the 1990s.

== Members and congregations ==

During the 20th century several settlements of the Old Order River Brethren in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and Ontario dwindled and finally became extinct. For 1935 and 1937 the Association of Religion Data Archives lists 472 members for the Old Order Yorker River Brethren, that is the Old Order River Brethren. In 1960 there were 340 members.

In 1986 there were 327 members in three subgroups, the Strickler group with 172 members, located in Lancaster and Franklin counties, Pennsylvania, and Dallas County, Iowa, the Horst group with 121 members in Lancaster and Franklin counties and the &quot;Old Church&quot; with 34 members in Franklin County.

In the year 2000 all groups of the Old Order River Brethren had together 328 members, organized in three subgroups and five congregations. The Strickler group had three districts, Franklin with 86 members, Lancaster with 83 and Dallas Center in Iowa with 33, all together 202 members. The Horst group had one district in Franklin County with 109 members, and the Old Church also one in Franklin County with 17 members. The horse and buggy people have relocated to Clay County, Kansas, between 2000 and 2010. In the 2010s a new church was planted in West Virginia.

The total population of all Old Order River Brethren groups including children and young not yet baptized members was between 530 and 535 around the year 2000. In 2014 all Old Order River Brethren groups together had about 550 members in five congregations, of which the &quot;Old Church&quot; had only about half a dozen members.

Poet and historian G. C. Waldrep (born 1968) is a member of the Old Order River Brethren as author Stephen Scott (19482011) was until his death.

<text>The United Zion Church is a River Brethren Christian denomination with roots in the Mennonite Church and the Radical Pietistic movement. 

A body that became known as &quot;River Brethren&quot; began about 1778 in Pennsylvania. They were a group of brethren near the Susquehanna River that had separated from the Mennonites. As such groups of brethren were often named by their location, they were called &quot;River Brethren&quot;. The majority of churches descending from the &quot;River Brethren&quot; are known as the Brethren in Christ Church.

Bishop Matthias Brinser was excluded from the River Brethren in 1855, and he organized his followers into a separate group, originally known as &quot;United Zion&#x27;s Children&quot;. The reason for the exclusion of Brinser and his followers was that he had led them in building a meeting house for worship. The church incorporated as United Zion Church in 1954. They are similar in doctrine and practice to the &quot;Brethren in Christ Church&quot;. Church organization allows for settling basic matters at the district conference, with a general conference being the highest level of church authority.

As of 2010, the church consisted of 721 members in 12 congregations in three Pennsylvania counties. There are two overseas churches located in Santiago, Chile. These churches began as a single church plant in 1988 in the Maipú suburb of Santiago. This church was locally given the name Fuente de Vida.

<text>The Church of the United Brethren in Christ is an evangelical Christian denomination with churches in 17 countries. It is Protestant, with an episcopal structure and Arminian theology, with roots in the Mennonite and German Reformed communities of 18th-century Pennsylvania, as well as close ties to Methodism. It was organized in 1800 by Martin Boehm and Philip William Otterbein and is the first American denomination that was not transplanted from Europe. It emerged from United Brethren churches that were at first unorganized, and not all of which joined this church when it was formally organized in 1800, following a 1789 conference at the Otterbein Church (Baltimore, Maryland).

In 1889, a controversy over membership in secret societies such as the Freemasons, the proper way to modify the church&#x27;s constitution, and other issues split the United Brethren into majority liberal and minority conservative blocs, the latter of which was led by Bishop Milton Wright (father of the Wright Brothers). Both groups continued to use the name &quot;Church of the United Brethren in Christ&quot;.

The majority faction, known as the Church of the United Brethren in Christ (New Constitution), merged with the Evangelical Church in 1946 to form a new denomination known as the Evangelical United Brethren Church (EUB). This in turn merged in 1968 with The Methodist Church to form the United Methodist Church (UMC).

The Wright-led faction was known as the &quot;Church of the United Brethren in Christ, Old Constitution&quot; until 1946 when it resumed usage of the original name. As of 2025, the denomination had about 600 congregations, with 47,300 members in fifteen countries. The US National Conference consists of about 200 churches and 25,000 members in the United States, plus mission districts in Haiti and India. The United States national office is located in Huntington, Indiana, as is the denomination&#x27;s only college, Huntington University.

==History==

Though the church was not organized until 1800, its roots reach back to 1767. In May of that year, a &quot;Great Meeting&quot; (part of the interdenominational revival movement the First Great Awakening) was held at a barn belonging to Isaac Long in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Martin Boehm (1725–1812), a Mennonite preacher, spoke of his becoming a Christian through crying out to God while plowing in the field. Philip William Otterbein (1726–1813), a Reformed pastor at York, Pennsylvania, left his seat, embraced Boehm and said to him, &quot;Wir sind Brüder (we are brethren).&quot;

The followers of Boehm and Otterbein formed a loose movement for many years. It spread to include German-speaking churches in Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland, and Ohio. In 1800, they began a yearly conference. Thirteen ministers attended the first conference at the home of Peter Kemp in Frederick, Maryland. At that conference in 1800, they adopted a name, the &quot;United Brethren in Christ.&quot; Boehm and Otterbein, now in their 70s, were elected as bishops. The United Brethren Church claims to be the first denomination to actually begin in the United States, rather than be transplanted from Europe. A Confession of Faith was adopted in 1815 (similar to one written by Otterbein in 1789), and it has remained the statement of church doctrine to the present. In 1841, they adopted a Constitution. It has remained mostly intact, being changed perhaps a dozen times.

William Otterbein retained a connection with the Reformed Church, pastoring a Reformed Church in Baltimore, Maryland from 1774 until his death in 1813. Martin Boehm was excluded by the Mennonites in 1775. He joined the Methodist Church in 1802, while remaining bishop of the United Brethren until his death in 1812. Francis Asbury, bishop of the Methodist Church in America, spoke at the memorial services of both of these United Brethren bishops. Otterbein had assisted in Asbury&#x27;s ordination.
The United Brethren took a strong stand against slavery in 1821. After 1837, slave owners were no longer allowed to remain as members of the United Brethren Church. In 1847, the United Brethren founded Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, which continues today. In 1853, the &quot;Home, Frontier, and Foreign Missionary Society&quot; was organized. Expansion occurred into the western United States, but the church&#x27;s stance against slavery limited expansion to the south.

===Church of the United Brethren in Christ (Old Constitution)===
By 1889, the United Brethren had grown to over 200,000 members with six bishops. In that same year they experienced a division. Denominational leaders desired to make three changes: to give local conferences proportional representation at the General Conference; to allow laymen to serve as delegates to General Conference; and to allow United Brethren members to hold membership in secret societies. However, the consensus process for amending the Constitution at the time made it difficult to amend; amendments required a 2/3 majority of all church members. However, the denomination believed these changes were necessary for the good of the church, and chose to enact them without this near consensus at the 1889 General Conference, held in York, Pennsylvania. They also adopted a new Confession of Faith.

A minority, mostly conservative faction felt the changes violated the Constitution because they were not made by a 2/3 majority of all church members. Milton Wright (the father of aviation pioneers Wilbur Wright and Orville Wright) was the only one of the church&#x27;s six bishops to side with the minority. He and 13 other conference delegates left the meeting and resumed the session at the York Opera House. Arguing that based upon church constitution requirements the majority faction had effectively withdrawn from the denomination, they declared themselves to be the true United Brethren Church.
However, most of the congregations that sided with Wright lost their property. Wright led this group— comprising 10,000 to 15,000 constituents—in those early years as they reorganized. A new headquarters began taking shape in 1897 in Huntington, Indiana, with the establishment of a publishing house, national offices, and Huntington College. Wright served as bishop until 1905.

Until 1946 two groups operated under the name Church of the United Brethren in Christ, distinguished by whether they were the Church of the United Brethren in Christ (Old Constitution) or the Church of the United Brethren in Christ (New Constitution). Both claimed 1800 as their founding date, with heritage dating to 1767, and the same history up to 1889.

In 1946, the larger New Constitution United Brethren church merged with the Evangelical Association to form the Evangelical United Brethren Church. That body in turn merged with The Methodist Church (USA) in 1968 to form the United Methodist Church. The present United Brethren Church is descended from the Old Constitution faction. This group eventually adopted two of the changes that led to the division of 1889 – local conferences have proportional representation at General Conference, and half of the delegates are laypersons. The present church contends that unlike in 1889, these changes were adopted constitutionally, by near consensus.

==Theology==
The Church of the United Brethren in Christ is a conservative Trinitarian body of Christians that hold the deity, humanity, and atonement of Jesus; that the Bible, in both the Old and New Testaments, is the inspired Word of God; and that salvation is through faith, repentance, and following after Christ. The church holds two ordinances: baptism and the Lord&#x27;s supper. The church takes a neutral position on the observance of foot washing, stating, &quot;the example of washing feet is left to the judgment of every one to practice or not...&quot;.

==Branches and connections==
For the first several decades the Church of the United Brethren in Christ was loosely organized, and known simply as the United Brethren Church. When they officially organized into a denomination, they adopted the name &quot;Church of the United Brethren in Christ&quot; in order to avoid confusion with the Unitas Fratrum (Unity of the Brethren), or as it more commonly was called in English, the United Brethren (also known as the Moravian Church.) Although there was influence by Pietism and the Moravians on the founders of the Church of the United Brethren in Christ, there is no direct organizational link.

Likewise, there are no organizational connections with the Brethren denominations coming out of the German Brethren and Swiss Brethren movements, nor are there any connections with various Latter Day Saint groups that use &quot;United Brethren&quot; in their name.

===Brethren in Christ===
Known branches of the Church of the United Brethren in Christ include several congregations led by United Brethren founder Martin Boehm. Initially known as River Brethren, they developed into several denominations, including the Brethren in Christ Church, Calvary Holiness Church, Old Order River Brethren/Yorker Brethren, and United Zion Church. While they were associated with the United Brethren during the early decades, they never joined when the movement formalized into a denomination.

===Missionary Church===
During the 19th century, John Swank and a small number of supporters left the United Brethren Church. They joined with a small faction that had broken from the larger Brethren in Christ Church. Led by John Wegner, this group was also known by the name &quot;Brethren in Christ&quot;. Part of this group, led by John Swank, later broke off and merged to become part of the Mennonite Brethren in Christ. The Mennonite Brethren in Christ eventually contributed to the convergence of denominations of what is now the Missionary Church, USA, headquartered in Fort Wayne, Indiana. The remainder of the Wegner/Swank Brethren in Christ became the Pentecostal Brethren in Christ before becoming part of the Pilgrim Holiness Church, which merged to become part of the Wesleyan Church.

===United Christian Church===
In addition a small group of members withdrew (primarily over a desire for a stronger stand on pacifism) to form one of the denominations known as the United Christian Church around the middle of the 19th century.

===Christian Union / Churches of Christ in Christian Union Church===

In 1848 a small group withdrew to form the Republican United Brethren Church. They later merged with another small splinter group called the Reformed United Brethren Church to create the Evangelical United Brethren Association. 
The Evangelical United Brethren Association is believed to have united with several other groups to form the Christian Union in 1864. In 1909 the Christian Union split into the Christian Union and the Churches of Christ in Christian Union.

They are not to be confused with the Evangelical Association that later was known as the Evangelical Church, before merging to become The Evangelical United Brethren Church.

===United Methodist Church &amp; United Church of Canada===
The largest &quot;branching&quot; came in 1889 when the main body divided into two groups. The larger group embraced a new constitution while the smaller group retained the original constitution. The larger group was known as the Church of the United Brethren in Christ or, later, The United Brethren Church (UB). In 1946 the United Brethren Church merged with the Evangelical Church to form the Evangelical United Brethren Church (EUB). In 1968 the Evangelical United Brethren Church merged with the Methodist Church to form the United Methodist Church (UMC).

In Canada the more liberal United Brethren group after 1889 joined with the Congregationalists in 1906. The Congregationalists then joined with the Methodist Church and most of the Presbyterian Churches in Canada in 1925 to form the United Church of Canada. The more conservative United Brethren Church after 1889 continues to this day as the United Brethren Church in Canada. When EUB churches in the United States entered the UMC in 1968, congregations in Central Canada merged with the United Church of Canada.

===Evangelical Church of North America &amp; Evangelical Missionary Church of Canada===
In 1968, a number of the Evangelical United Brethren Churches in the US and Canada left the Evangelical United Brethren Church/United Methodist Church. Some rejoined the Church of the United Brethren in Christ, other denominations, or remained independent. Most joined to form the Evangelical Church of North America. Later, because of international laws and legal requirements by Revenue Canada, the Canadian branch of the Evangelical Church of North America withdrew to form its own denomination. The Evangelical Church in Canada then merged with the Missionary Church of Canada to form the Evangelical Missionary Church in Canada. Fraternal ties between the Evangelical Church and the Evangelical Missionary Church have been maintained.

===The Association of Evangelical Churches===
In 1981 a group of former Evangelical United Brethren churches in Pennsylvania separated from the Evangelical Church of North America over concerns regarding the ownership of congregational property. They established the Association of Evangelical Churches. The Association began an annual slate of ministry events with Family Camp in August 1982, and has since added Men&#x27;s Retreat, Ministers&#x27; Retreat, Youth Retreat, and Ladies Retreat. In addition, its Board of Ministry trains, licenses, and ordains workers for ministry. The Association was a member of the Christian Holiness Partnership. Four chairmen have served the Association since its inception: Rev. Evans Mitchell 1982–1986; Rev. Gary Lyons 1986–1998; Rev. James Nelson 1998–2006; and Rev. Allen Young since 2006.

===United Believers in Christ===
All but one of the churches of California Conference of the Church of the United Brethren in Christ, USA, withdrew from the denomination during the fall of 2005 and started their own group, called United Believers in Christ. The denomination had just gone through a two-year effort to merge into the Missionary Church USA denomination. Although the California churches had strongly supported the initiatives of UBHope, a group which opposed joining with the Missionary Church, USA, and although many of the ideas ultimately adopted originated from UBHope, the California churches continued to disagree with the direction of the Church of the United Brethren in Christ, USA.

===Church of the United Brethren in Christ (Old Constitution)===
The smaller group of churches resulting from the 1889 division became known as the Church of the United Brethren in Christ (Old Constitution). Later, after the other Church of the United Brethren in Christ (New Constitution) changed names with its 1946 merger with the Evangelical Church, &quot;Old Constitution&quot; was dropped from the name. Today, they are often casually referred to as United Brethren (UB) or the United Brethren Church (UBC).

==Church of the United Brethren in Christ, International==

In the late 1980s through the early 21st century, a need to comply with changing international laws resulted in the creation of a number of self-governing United Brethren &quot;national conferences&quot;, organized by country. These independent national denominations covenanted together to create an interdependent body called the Church of the United Brethren in Christ, International. They must all agree to follow the Confession of Faith of 1815, as well as a set of seven Core Values adopted in 2001. The other international governing documents include a Constitution and By-Laws.

The General Conference of the Church of the United Brethren in Christ, International, meets every three years. It is the highest governing body of the church, and is composed of representatives from the ten national conferences. Each national conference can send two delegates, usually its Bishop or General Superintendent and its Missions Director. The national conference of each country elects its own highest official (often called the bishop). These national conference officials make up an international Executive Committee. The Executive Committee meets annually, usually electronically, to take care of business between sessions of the General Conference. Canadian Bishop Brian Magnus is the current chair of the United Brethren International Executive Committee.

===National conferences===
The Church of the United Brethren in Christ, International currently consists of ten self-governing national conferences. Seven of them existed when the international structure was adopted in 2001. Two more conferences, Mexico and the Philippines, were accepted as part of the denomination in 2005, and the U.B. churches in Guatemala became the tenth national conference in 2010. The Philippines National Conference was removed from membership by the 2017 General Conference. A group of nearly 30 churches in Haiti, which had affiliated with the United Brethren in 2000 as a mission district, and operated under the supervision of the Canadian national conference, organized as a national conference in 2019. Here is the total list of national conferences:
*The United Brethren Church in Canada
*The Church of the United Brethren in Christ, Honduras
*The Church of the United Brethren in Christ, Hong Kong
*The Church of the United Brethren in Christ, Jamaica
*The Church of the United Brethren in Christ, Mexico
*The Church of the United Brethren in Christ, Nicaragua
*The Church of the United Brethren in Christ, Sierra Leone
*The Church of the United Brethren in Christ, USA
*The Church of the United Brethren in Christ, Guatemala
*The Church of the United Brethren in Christ, Haiti

===Mission districts===
In addition there are various mission districts. A mission district is a collection of churches in a country which are not yet organized into a national conference. Instead, those churches are under the supervision of a national conference. For example, UB Global, the joint mission organization of the United Brethren churches in the United States and Canada, currently oversees a mission district in India and the two churches in Macau, while the Hong Kong Conference oversees the work in Thailand. Any mission district can seek status as a national conference if it meets and maintains the following criteria:
# It consists of at least five churches within that country.
# It is a legally recognized entity within that country.
# No other United Brethren national conference exists in that country.
# It is organized with a constitution and other governing documents.
# Its governing documents, teachings, and practices do not conflict with the Confession of Faith, Core Values, Constitution, and Bylaws of the Church of the United Brethren in Christ, International.

If a mission district meets those requirements, it can apply for national conference status through this procedure:
# The churches in the mission district vote to seek membership in the Church of the United Brethren in Christ, International.
# They develop their governing documents and submit them to the international Executive Committee for review.
# The General Conference approves, by a two-thirds vote, the request for membership.

These are the current mission districts:
* Costa Rica (oversight by Nicaragua)
* El Salvador (oversight by Honduras)
* Germany (oversight by Sierra Leone)
* India (oversight by UB Global [USA])
* Macau (oversight by UB Global [USA])
* Thailand (oversight by Hong Kong)
* Liberia (oversight by Sierra Leone)
* France (oversight by UB Global [USA]))

(see also: other Protestant missionary societies in China during the 19th century)

===Organization===
The General Conference of the Church of the United Brethren in Christ, International, meets every three years. It is the highest governing body of the church, and is composed of representatives from the various national conferences. Each national conference can send two delegates. The national conference of each country elects its own highest official (often called the bishop). These national conference officials make up an international Executive Committee. The Executive Committee meets annually to take care of business between sessions of the General Conference.

==Church of the United Brethren in Christ, USA==

===Organization===
The Church of the United Brethren in Christ, USA is the United Brethren national conference for the United States. Its national offices are located in Huntington, Indiana. Led by an elected bishop, it is composed of clergy and lay representatives from US congregations and US-sponsored mission fields. The national conference meets every two years.

On October 14, 2003, the Executive Leadership Team of the United Brethren Church, USA voted to pursue joining with the Missionary Church. The joining was tentatively scheduled to occur in 2005 but was defeated by a vote of the membership in 2004. This action, had it received a favorable vote, would have combined the United Brethren churches in the United States into the Missionary Church USA, so that all of those congregations would have become Missionary Church congregations.

At the 2005 National Conference of the United Brethren Church, USA significant changes were passed that initiated a major restructuring and refocusing of the denomination. The new organizational structure eliminated the multiple geographical &quot;annual conferences&quot; which had existed since 1810, and replaced them with smaller groupings, called &quot;clusters&quot;, consisting of 5-10 churches and their senior pastors. Clusters were designed to better equip congregations and their leadership while building stronger relationships and accountability.

The new structure did the following:

*Moved the National Conference from a four-year cycle to a two-year cycle.
*Required each United Brethren church in the United States to affirm its continued support for a covenant agreement. The covenant agreement lays out the minimum expectations to be a United Brethren church.
*Required that all pastors and their congregations work together with other pastors and congregations in groups of 5-10 churches called &quot;clusters.&quot; The new structure allowed flexibility in the formation and focus of a cluster. Each cluster receives ongoing training to equip the pastors in the cluster to equip their churches. All cluster leaders are appointed by the United States bishop.
*Allowed for a variety of mission-focused networks and associations to be created. These groups could revolve around world evangelism, camps, church planting, or any number of other affinities.
*Required a &quot;partnership fee&quot; of 3.5% of a church&#x27;s income. Before 2005, most churches paid around 12% of their income toward conference and denominational interests. The elimination of the annual conferences, a mid-level geographic entity with its own leaders and programs, enabled the fee to be drastically reduced and thereby keep more finances at the local church level.

The covenant must be signed by each church and reciprocally signed by the bishop. If a church chooses not to sign the covenant, they are basically withdrawing from the denomination. The covenant, as most recently revised, includes these points:
# We commit to the Confession of Faith and Core Values of the Church of the United Brethren in Christ, International.
# We agree to abide by the Constitution and Discipline of the US National Conference.
# We will prioritize our assets, energies, and ministries toward fulfilling the Great Commission.
# We will support the broader ministry and mission of the Church of the United Brethren in Christ, USA, through prayer, promotion of its interests, and the annual partnership fee.

<text>J-pop (often stylized in all caps; an abbreviated form of &quot;Japanese popular music&quot;), natively known simply as , is the name for a form of popular music that entered the musical mainstream of Japan in the 1990s. Modern J-pop has its roots in traditional music of Japan, and significantly in 1960s pop and rock music. J-pop replaced &quot;kayōkyoku&quot; (&quot;Lyric Singing Music&quot;), a term for Japanese popular music from the 1920s to the 1980s in the Japanese music scene.

Japanese rock bands such as Happy End fused the Beatles and Beach Boys-style rock with Japanese music in the 1960s1970s. J-pop was further defined by new wave and crossover fusion acts of the late 1970s, such as Yellow Magic Orchestra and Southern All Stars. Popular styles of Japanese pop music include city pop and technopop during the 1970s1980s, and J-Euro (such as Namie Amuro) and Shibuya-kei during the 1990s and 2000s.

Japanese country had popularity during the international popularity of Westerns in the 1960s1970s as well, and it still has appeal due to the work of musicians like Charlie Nagatani and Tomi Fujiyama, along with venues like Little Texas in Tokyo. Japanese hip hop became mainstream with producer Nujabes during the 1990s–2000s, especially his work on &quot;Samurai Champloo&quot;, and Japanese pop culture is often seen with anime in hip hop. In addition, Latin music, CCM, and gospel music have scenes within J-pop.

==Form and definition==

The origin of modern J-pop is said to be Japanese-language rock music inspired by the likes of The Beatles. Unlike the Japanese music genre called &quot;kayōkyoku&quot;, J-pop uses a special kind of pronunciation, which is similar to that of English. One notable singer to do so is Keisuke Kuwata, who pronounced the Japanese word &quot;karada&quot; (&quot;body&quot;) as &quot;kyerada&quot;. Additionally, unlike Western music, the major second (&quot;sol&quot; and &quot;la&quot;) was usually not used in Japanese music, except art music, before rock music became popular in Japan. When the Group Sounds genre, which was inspired by Western rock, became popular, Japanese pop music adopted the major second, which was used in the final sounds of The Beatles&#x27; song &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; and The Rolling Stones&#x27; song &quot;(I Can&#x27;t Get No) Satisfaction&quot;. Although Japanese pop music changed from music based on Japanese pentatonic scale and distortional tetrachord to the more occidental music over time, music that drew from the traditional Japanese singing style remained popular (such as that of Ringo Shiina).

At first, the term &quot;J-pop&quot; was used only for Western-style musicians in Japan, such as Pizzicato Five and Flipper&#x27;s Guitar, just after Japanese radio station J-Wave was established. On the other hand, Mitsuhiro Hidaka of AAA from Avex Trax said that J-pop was originally derived from the Eurobeat genre. However, the term became a blanket term, covering other music genres—such as the majority of Japanese rock music of the 1990s.

In 1990, the Japanese subsidiary of Tower Records defined J-pop as all Japanese music belonging to the Recording Industry Association of Japan except Japanese independent music (which they term &quot;J-indie&quot;); their stores began to use additional classifications, such as J-club, J-punk, J-hip-hop, J-reggae, J-anime, and Visual kei by 2008, after independent musicians started to release works via major labels. Ito Music City, a Japanese record store, adopted expanded classifications including Group Sounds, idol of the 1970s–1980s, enka, folk and established musicians of the 1970s–1980s, in addition to the main J-pop genres.

Whereas rock musicians in Japan usually hate the term &quot;pop&quot;, Taro Kato, a member of pop punk band Beat Crusaders, pointed out that the encoded pop music, like pop art, was catchier than &quot;J-pop&quot; and he also said that J-pop was the music, memorable for its frequency of airplay, in an interview when the band completed their first full-length studio album under a major label, &quot;P.O.A.: Pop on Arrival&quot;, in 2005. Because the band did not want to perform J-pop music, their album featured the 1980s Pop of MTV. According to his fellow band member Toru Hidaka, the 1990s music that influenced him (such as Nirvana, Hi-Standard, and Flipper&#x27;s Guitar) was not listened to by fans of other music in Japan at that time.

In contrast to this, although many Japanese rock musicians until the late 1980s disrespected the &quot;kayōkyoku&quot; music, many of Japanese rock bands of the 1990s—such as Glay—assimilated &quot;kayōkyoku&quot; into their music. After the late 1980s, breakbeat and samplers also changed the Japanese music scene, where expert drummers had played good rhythm because traditional Japanese music did not have the rhythm based on rock or blues.

Hide of Greeeen openly described their music genre as J-pop. He said, &quot;I also love rock, hip hop and breakbeats, but my field is consistently J-pop. For example, hip hop musicians learn &#x27;the culture of hip hop&#x27; when they begin their career. We are not like those musicians and we love the music as sounds very much. Those professional people may say &#x27;What are you doing?&#x27; but I think that our musical style is cool after all. The good thing is good.&quot;

One term recently coined in relation to &quot;J-pop&quot; is coming from the industry&#x27;s association with other popular cultures within Japan that has gained international attention like city pop, anisong, Vocaloids and VTubing.

==History==

===1920s–1960s: Ryūkōka===
Japanese popular music, called &quot;ryūkōka&quot; before being split into &quot;enka&quot; and &quot;poppusu&quot;,
has origins in the Meiji period, but most Japanese scholars consider the Taishō period to be the actual starting point of &quot;ryūkōka&quot;, as it is the era in which the genre first gained nationwide popularity. By the Taishō period, Western musical techniques and instruments, which had been introduced to Japan in the Meiji period, were widely used. Influenced by Western genres such as jazz and blues, &quot;ryūkōka&quot; incorporated Western instruments such as the violin, harmonica, and guitar. However, the melodies were often written according to the traditional Japanese pentatonic scale. In the 1930s, Ichiro Fujiyama released popular songs with his tenor voice. Fujiyama sang songs with a lower volume than opera through the microphone (the technique is sometimes called &quot;crooning&quot;).

Jazz musician Ryoichi Hattori attempted to produce Japanese native music which had a &quot;flavor&quot; of blues.
He composed Noriko Awaya&#x27;s hit song &quot;Wakare no Blues&quot; (lit. &quot;Farewell Blues&quot;). Awaya became a famous popular singer and was called &quot;Queen of Blues&quot; in Japan. Due to pressure from the Imperial Army during the war, the performance of jazz music was temporarily halted in Japan. Hattori, who stayed in Shanghai at the end of the war, produced hit songs such as Shizuko Kasagi&#x27;s &quot;Tokyo Boogie-Woogie&quot; and Ichiro Fujiyama&#x27;s &quot;Aoi Sanmyaku&quot; (lit. &quot;Blue Mountain Range&quot;). Hattori later became known as the &quot;Father of Japanese &quot;poppusu&quot;&quot;. The United States soldiers—who were occupying Japan at the time—and the Far East Network introduced a number of new musical styles to the country. Boogie-woogie, Mambo, Blues, and Country music were performed by Japanese musicians for the American troops. Chiemi Eri&#x27;s cover song &quot;Tennessee Waltz&quot; (1952), Hibari Misora&#x27;s &quot;Omatsuri Mambo&quot; (1952), and Izumi Yukimura&#x27;s cover song &quot;Till I Waltz Again with You&quot; (1953) also became popular. Foreign musicians and groups, including JATP and Louis Armstrong, visited Japan to perform. In the mid-1950s, became a popular venue for live jazz music. Jazz had a large impact on Japanese &quot;poppusu&quot;, though &quot;authentic&quot; jazz did not become the mainstream genre of music in Japan. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Japanese pop was polarized between urban &quot;kayō&quot; and modern &quot;enka&quot;.

Modern J-pop is also sometimes believed to have had its roots with Chinese immigrant jazz musicians who had fled Shanghai during the communist takeover, and were collaborating with American soldiers to help introduce a variety of new genres to the Japanese public. In 1949, when the communists took over and established the People&#x27;s Republic of China on the mainland, one of the first actions taken by the government was to denounce popular music (specifically both Chinese pop music, known as Mandopop, and Western pop music) as decadent music, and for decades afterwards the Communist Party would promote Chinese revolutionary songs while suppressing Chinese folk songs, Chinese pop songs and Western pop songs. Dissatisfied with Chairman Mao Zedong&#x27;s new music policies, a number of Shanghainese jazz musicians fled to the British colony of Hong Kong and established Cantopop, which is pop music sung in the Cantonese dialect of Chinese. However, a few musicians instead settled in Japan, where they became members of the Far East Network and collaborated with the American soldiers to help expose the Japanese public to a wide variety of western genres. This eventually lead to the establishment of modern Japanese pop music, known as &quot;kayōkyoku&quot;.

===1960s: Origin of modern style===

====Rokabirī Boom and Wasei pops====
During the 1950s and 60s, many Kayōkyoku groups and singers gained experience performing on US military bases in Japan. Around the same time, yakuza manager Kazuo Taoka reorganized the concert touring industry by treating the performers as professionals. Many of these performers later became key participants in the J-pop genre.

In 1956, Japan&#x27;s rock and roll craze began, due to the country music group known as Kosaka Kazuya and the Wagon Masters; their rendition of Elvis Presley&#x27;s song &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; helped to fuel the trend. The music was called &quot;rockabilly&quot; (or &quot;rokabirī&quot;) by the Japanese media. Performers learned to play the music and translate the lyrics of popular American songs, resulting in the birth of . The rockabilly movement would reach its peak when 45,000 people saw the performances by Japanese singers at the first Nichigeki Western Carnival in one week of February 1958.

Kyu Sakamoto, a fan of Elvis, made his stage début as a member of the band The Drifters at the Nichigeki Western Carnival in 1958. His 1961 song &quot;Ue wo Muite Arukō&quot; (&quot;Let&#x27;s Look Up and Walk&quot;), known in other parts of the world as &quot;Sukiyaki&quot;, was released to the United States in 1963. It was the first Japanese song to reach the Number One position in the United States, spending four weeks in &quot;Cash Box&quot; and three weeks in &quot;Billboard&quot;. It also received a gold record for selling one million copies. During this period, female duo The Peanuts also became popular, singing a song in the movie &quot;Mothra&quot;. Their songs, such as &quot;Furimukanaide&quot; (&quot;Don&#x27;t Turn Around&quot;) were later covered by Candies on their album &quot;Candy Label&quot;. Artists like Kyu Sakamoto and The Peanuts were called .

After frequently changing members, Chosuke Ikariya re-formed The Drifters in 1964 under the same name. At a Beatles concert in 1966, they acted as curtain raisers, but the audience generally objected. Eventually, The Drifters became popular in Japan, releasing &quot;Zundoko-Bushi&quot; (&quot;Echoic word tune&quot;) in 1969. Along with &quot;enka&quot; singer Keiko Fuji, they won &quot;the award for mass popularity&quot; at the 12th Japan Record Awards in 1970. Keiko Fuji&#x27;s 1970 album &quot;Shinjuku no Onna/&#x27;Enka no Hoshi&#x27; Fuji Keiko no Subete&quot; (&quot;Woman in Shinjuku/&#x27;Star of &quot;Enka&quot;″ All of Keiko Fuji&quot;) established an all-time record in the history of the Japanese Oricon chart by staying in the Number One spot for 20 consecutive weeks. The Drifters later came to be known as television personalities and invited idols such as Momoe Yamaguchi and Candies to their television program.

====Ereki boom and group sounds====
The Ventures visited Japan in 1962, causing the widespread embrace of the electric guitar called the &quot;&quot;Ereki&quot; boom&quot;. Yūzō Kayama and Takeshi Terauchi became famous players of electric guitar. In 1966, the Beatles came to Japan and sang their songs at the Nippon Budokan, becoming the first rock music band to perform a concert there. The public believed that the Beatles would cause juvenile delinquency. The Japanese government deployed riot police against young rock fans at the Nippon Budokan. John Lennon felt that they were not well regarded in Japan, but Beatlemania has never really died there. The Beatles inspired Japanese bands, creating the group sounds genre in Japan.

Most Japanese musicians felt that they could not sing rock in Japanese, so the popularity of Japanese rock gradually declined. As a result, there were debates such as &quot;Should we sing rock music in Japanese?&quot; and &quot;Should we sing in English?&quot; between Happy End and Yuya Uchida about Japanese rock music. This confrontation was called . Happy End proved that rock music could be sung in Japanese, and one theory holds that their music became one of the origins of modern J-pop. The Beatles also inspired Eikichi Yazawa, who grew up in an underprivileged family, his father dying when he was a child. Keisuke Kuwata, who grew up in a dual-income family, was influenced by the Beatles through his older sister, then an avid fan. Yōsui Inoue was also a fan of The Beatles, but he said that his music style was not particularly related to them. After Happy End disbanded in 1973, Haruomi Hosono, a former member, began a solo career and later formed Yellow Magic Orchestra.

===1970s: Development of &quot;new music&quot;===

====&quot;Fōku&quot; and new music====
In the early 1960s, some Japanese music became influenced by the American folk music revival; this was called , although the genre of music was mostly covers of original songs. In the late 1960s, the Folk Crusaders became famous and the underground music around that time became called &quot;fōku&quot;. As with &quot;enka&quot;, Japanese &quot;fōku&quot; singers Wataru Takada performed social satires.

In the early 1970s, the emphasis shifted from &quot;fōku&quot;″s simple songs with a single guitar accompaniment to more complex musical arrangements known as . Instead of social messages, the songs focused on more personal messages, such as love. In 1972, singer-songwriter Takuro Yoshida produced a hit song &quot;Kekkon Shiyouyo&quot; (&quot;Let&#x27;s marry&quot;) without decent television promotion, though fans of &quot;fōku&quot; music became very angry because his music seemed to be a low effort or low quality form of music. The highest-selling single of the year was the &quot;enka&quot; song by Shiro Miya and the Pinkara Trio, &quot;Onna no Michi&quot;. The song eventually sold over 3.25 million copies. On December 1, 1973, Yōsui Inoue released the album &quot;Kōri no Sekai&quot;, which topped the Oricon charts and remained in Top 10 for 113 weeks. It spent 13 consecutive weeks in the number-one spot, and eventually established a still-standing record of a total 35 weeks at the number-one position on the Oricon charts. Yumi Matsutoya, formerly known by her maiden name Yumi Arai, also became a notable singer-songwriter during this period In October 1975, she released a single &quot;Ano Hi ni Kaeritai&quot; (&quot;I want to return to that day&quot;), making it her first number-one single on the Oricon charts. Miyuki Nakajima, Amii Ozaki, and Junko Yagami were also popular singer-songwriters during this period. At first, only Yumi Matsutoya was commonly called a new music artist, but the concept of Japanese &quot;fōku&quot; music changed around that time. In 1979, Chage and Aska made their debut, and folk band Off Course (with singer Kazumasa Oda) released a hit song &quot;Sayonara&quot; (&quot;Good-bye&quot;).

Saki Kubota was described as the standard bearer of new music.

====Emergence of Japanese rock and electronic music====
Rock music remained a relatively underground music genre in the early 1970s in Japan, though Happy End managed to gain mainstream success fusing rock with traditional Japanese music. Several Japanese musicians began experimenting with electronic music, including electronic rock. The most notable was the internationally renowned Isao Tomita, whose 1972 album &quot;Electric Samurai: Switched on Rock&quot; featured electronic synthesizer renditions of contemporary rock and pop songs. Other early examples of electronic rock records include Inoue Yousui&#x27;s folk rock and pop rock album &quot;Ice World&quot; (1973) and Osamu Kitajima&#x27;s progressive psychedelic rock album &quot;Benzaiten&quot; (1974), both of which involved contributions from Haruomi Hosono, who later started the electronic music group &quot;Yellow Magic Band&quot; (later known as Yellow Magic Orchestra) in 1977.

In 1978, Eikichi Yazawa&#x27;s rock single &quot;Jikan yo Tomare&quot; (&quot;Time, Stop&quot;) became a smash hit that sold over 639,000 copies. He is regarded as one of the pioneers of Japanese rock. He sought worldwide success, and in 1980 he signed a contract with the Warner Pioneer record company and moved to the West Coast of the United States. He recorded the albums &quot;Yazawa&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Just Rock n&#x27; Roll&quot;, and &quot;Flash in Japan&quot;, all of which were released worldwide, but were not very commercially successful. Keisuke Kuwata formed the rock band Southern All Stars (SAS), which made their debut in 1978. Southern All Stars remains very popular in Japan today.

In the same year, Yellow Magic Orchestra (YMO) also made their official debut with their self-titled album. The band, whose members were Haruomi Hosono, Yukihiro Takahashi and Ryuichi Sakamoto, developed electropop, or technopop as it is known in Japan, in addition to pioneering synthpop and electro music. Their 1979 album &quot;Solid State Survivor&quot; reached number one on the Oricon charts in July 1980, and went on to sell two million records worldwide. At around the same time, the YMO albums &quot;Solid State Survivor&quot; and &quot;X∞Multiplies&quot; held both the top two spots on the Oricon charts for seven consecutive weeks, making YMO the only band in Japanese chart history to achieve this feat. Young fans of their music during this period became known as the . YMO had a significant impact on Japanese pop music, which started becoming increasingly dominated by electronic music due to their influence, and they had an equally large impact on electronic music across the world. Southern All Stars and Yellow Magic Orchestra symbolized the end of New Music and paved the way for the emergence of the J-pop genre in the 1980s. Both bands, SAS and YMO, would later be ranked at the top of HMV Japan&#x27;s list of top 100 Japanese musicians of all time.

===1980s: Fusion with &quot;kayōkyoku&quot;===
====City pop====

In the early 1980s, with the spread of car stereos, the term came to describe a type of popular music that had a big city theme. Tokyo in particular inspired many songs of this form. During this time, music fans and artists in Japan were influenced by album-oriented rock (especially adult contemporary) and crossover (especially jazz fusion). City pop was affected by new music, though its origins have been traced back to the mid-1970s, with the work of the Japanese rock band Happy End and its former member Haruomi Hosono, as well as Tatsuro Yamashita.

The popularity of city pop plummeted when the Japanese asset price bubble burst in 1990. Its musical characteristics (except its &quot;cultural background&quot;) were inherited by 1990s Shibuya-kei musicians such as Pizzicato Five and Flipper&#x27;s Guitar.

====Growth of the Japanese rock industry====

Throughout the 1980s, rock bands such as Southern All Stars, RC Succession, Anzen Chitai, The Checkers, The Alfee, and The Blue Hearts became popular. Anzen Chitai came from Yosui Inoue&#x27;s backup band. On December 1, 1983, rock singer Yutaka Ozaki debuted at the age of 18. In 1986, The Alfee became the first artists to play a concert in front of an audience of 100,000 people in Japan. Some Japanese musicians, such as Boøwy, TM Network, and Buck-Tick, were influenced by New Romanticism.

Boøwy became an especially influential rock band, whose members included singer Kyosuke Himuro and guitarist Tomoyasu Hotei. Their three albums reached number one in 1988, making them the first male artists to have three number-ones within a single year. Subsequent Japanese rock bands were modeled on this band. Guitarist Tak Matsumoto, who supported TM Network&#x27;s concerts, formed rock duo B&#x27;z with singer Koshi Inaba in 1988.

In the late 1980s, girl band Princess Princess became a successful pop-rock band. Their singles &quot;Diamonds&quot; and &quot;Sekai de Ichiban Atsui Natsu&quot; (&quot;World&#x27;s Hottest Summer&quot;) were ranked at the number-one and number-two spots, respectively, on the 1989 Oricon Yearly Single Charts.

In the late 1980s, a new trend also emerged in Japanese rock music: the &quot;visual kei&quot;, a movement notable by male bands who wore makeup, extravagant hair styles, and androgynous costumes. The most successful representatives of the movement are X Japan (formerly known as &quot;X&quot;) and Buck-Tick. X Japan released their first album &quot;Vanishing Vision&quot; on the indie label Extasy Records in 1988; their album &quot;Blue Blood&quot; was released on CBS Sony in 1989. &quot;Blue Blood&quot; sold 712,000 copies, and their 1991 album &quot;Jealousy&quot; sold over 1.11 million copies. Surprisingly, X Japan were a heavy metal band, but guitarist hide later came under the influence of alternative rock, releasing his first solo album &quot;Hide Your Face&quot; in 1994 and launching his successful solo career.

====Golden age, decline and transfiguration of Idols====
In the 1970s, the popularity of female idol singers such as Mari Amachi, Saori Minami, Momoe Yamaguchi, and Candies increased. Momoe Yamaguchi was one of the first &quot;kayōkyoku&quot; singers to use the special pronunciation characteristic of J-pop. In 1972, Hiromi Go made his debut with the song &quot;Otokonoko Onnanoko&quot; (&quot;Boy and Girl&quot;). Hiromi Go originally came from Johnny &amp; Associates. In 1976, female duo Pink Lady made their debut with the single &quot;Pepper Keibu&quot;. They released a record nine consecutive number-one singles.

In the 1980s, Japanese idols inherited New Music, though the term fell out of usage. Seiko Matsuda especially adopted song producers of previous generations. In 1980, her third single &quot;Kaze wa Aki Iro&quot; (&quot;Wind is autumn color&quot;) reached the number-one spot on the Oricon charts. Haruomi Hosono also joined the production of her music. She eventually became the first artist to make 24 consecutive number-one singles, breaking Pink Lady&#x27;s record. Other female idol singers achieved significant popularity in the 1980s, such as Akina Nakamori, Yukiko Okada, Kyōko Koizumi, Yoko Minamino, Momoko Kikuchi, Yōko Oginome, Miho Nakayama, Minako Honda, and Chisato Moritaka. Okada received the Best New Artist award from the Japan Record Awards in 1984. Nakamori won the Grand Prix award for two consecutive years (1985 and 1986), also at the Japan Record Awards. Japanese idol band Onyanko Club made their debut in 1985, and produced popular singer Shizuka Kudō. They changed the image of Japanese idols.

Around 1985, however, people began to be disenchanted with the system for creating idols. In 1986, idol singer Yukiko Okada&#x27;s song &quot;Kuchibiru Network&quot; (&quot;Lips&#x27; Network&quot;), written by Seiko Matsuda and composed by Ryuichi Sakamoto, became a hit song, but she committed suicide immediately after that. Hikaru Genji, one of the Johnny &amp; Associates bands, made their debut in 1987. They became a highly influential rollerskating boy band, with some of their members gaining their own fame as they got older. Their song &quot;Paradise Ginga&quot;, written by Aska, won the Grand Prix award at the 30th Japan Record Awards in 1988. Some of the group&#x27;s backing dancers later formed SMAP. The late 1980s also saw the rise of the female duo Wink. They did not laugh, unlike Japanese idols of former eras. Wink debuted in 1988, surpassing the popularity of the then-most popular female duo, BaBe. Wink&#x27;s song &quot;Samishii Nettaigyo&quot; won the grand prix award at the 31st Japan Record Awards in 1989.

Popular singer Hibari Misora died in 1989, and many &quot;kayōkyoku&quot; programs, such as &quot;The Best Ten&quot;, were closed. CoCo made their hit debut with the 1989 single &quot;Equal Romance&quot; for the hit anime series &quot;Ranma ½&quot;. Tetsuya Komuro, a member of TM Network, broke Seiko Matsuda&#x27;s streak of 25 consecutive number-ones by making his single &quot;Gravity of Love&quot; to debut at number-one in November 1989.

===1990s: Coining of the term &quot;J-pop&quot;===

====1990–1997: Growing market====
In the 1990s, the term J-pop came to refer to all Japanese popular songs except &quot;enka&quot;. During this period, the Japanese music industry sought marketing effectiveness. Notable examples of commercial music from the era were the tie-in music from the agency Being and the follow-on, Tetsuya Komuro&#x27;s disco music. The period between around 1990 and 1993 was dominated by artists from the Being agency, including B&#x27;z, Tube, B.B.Queens, T-Bolan, Zard, Wands, Maki Ohguro, Deen, and Field of View. They were called the . Many of those artists topped the charts and established new records, notably B&#x27;z, which eventually established a new record for consecutive number-one singles, surpassing Seiko Matsuda&#x27;s record. B&#x27;z is the Japanese biggest selling artist of all time, according to Oricon charts and RIAJ certifications. On the other hand, Wands, regarded as a pioneer of the &quot;J-pop Boom&quot; of the 1990s, had trouble because member Show Wesugi wanted to play alternative rock/grunge.
Many artists surpassed the two-million-copy mark in the 1990s. Kazumasa Oda&#x27;s 1991 single &quot;Oh! Yeah!/Love Story wa Totsuzen ni&quot;, Chage and Aska&#x27;s 1991 single &quot;Say Yes&quot; and 1993 single &quot;Yah Yah Yah&quot;, Kome Kome Club&#x27;s 1992 single &quot;Kimi ga Iru Dake de&quot;, Mr. Children&#x27;s 1994 single &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; and 1996 single &quot;Namonaki Uta&quot;, and Globe&#x27;s 1996 single &quot;Departures&quot; are examples of songs that sold more than 2 million copies. Dreams Come True&#x27;s 1992 album &quot;The Swinging Star&quot; became the first album to sell over 3 million copies in Japan. Mr. Children&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;Atomic Heart&quot; established a new record, selling 3.43 million copies on Oricon charts. The duo Chage and Aska, who started recording in late 1979, became very popular during this period. They released a string of consecutive hits throughout the early 1990s; in 1996, they took part in &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;, making them the first Asian group to do so.
After TM Network disbanded in 1994, Tetsuya Komuro became a serious song producer. The period between 1994 and 1997 was dominated by dance and techno acts from the , such as TRF, Ryoko Shinohara, Yuki Uchida, Namie Amuro, Hitomi, Globe, Tomomi Kahala, and Ami Suzuki. In that time, Komuro was responsible for 20 hit songs, each selling more than a million copies. While Globe&#x27;s 1996 album &quot;Globe&quot; sold 4.13 million copies, establishing a record at the time, Namie Amuro&#x27;s 1997 song &quot;Can You Celebrate?&quot; sold 2.29 million copies, is the best selling single of all time by the female solo artist in the history of Jpop. His total sales as a song producer reached 170 million copies. By 1998, Komuro&#x27;s songs had become less popular. By the middle part of the first decade of the 21st century, Komuro&#x27;s debt lead him to attempt the sale of his song catalog—which he did not actually own—to an investor. When the investor found out and sued, Komuro tried to sell the catalog to &quot;another&quot; investor in order to pay the judgement he owed the first investor.

Namie Amuro, who was arguably the most popular solo singer in the period, came from the &quot;Okinawa Actors School&quot;, which also incubated the bands MAX and Speed. At first, while still a part of the Komuro Family, Amuro remained in the dance music genre, but she slowly changed her music style to contemporary R&amp;B and ended her partnership with Tetsuya Komuro. Komuro&#x27;s band Globe became a trance band after their 2001 album &quot;Outernet&quot;.

====1997–1999: Commercial peak====

The sales in the Japanese music market continued to increase. In October 1997, Glay released their album &quot;Review -The Best of Glay&quot;, which sold 4.87 million copies, breaking Globe&#x27;s earlier record. However, it was surpassed in the next year by B&#x27;z&#x27;s album &quot;B&#x27;z The Best &quot;Pleasure&quot;&quot;, which sold 5.12 million copies. The Japanese market for physical music sales peaked in 1998, recording sales of . In March 1999, Hikaru Utada released her first Japanese album, &quot;First Love&quot;, which sold 7.65 million copies, making it the best-selling album in Oricon history.

The late 1990s saw the popularity of rock bands, such as Glay, Luna Sea, and L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel, most of them related to the &quot;visual kei&quot; movement, though they later changed their style. At the time, rock musicians in Japan were absorbing &quot;kayōkyoku&quot; music after the genre vanished. Glay became especially successful, with massive exposure in the media, comparable to that of the most popular pop singers produced by Tetsuya Komuro. In July 1999, Glay played a concert to a record audience of 200,000 people at the Makuhari Messe, certified by Guinness World Records as the biggest solo concert in Japan. In July 1999, L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel released two albums, &quot;Arc&quot; and &quot;Ray&quot;, at the same time; they sold over 3.02 million combined copies in the first week of release.

X Japan announced their disbandment in September 1997 and their guitarist hide died in May 1998. His funeral had a record attendance of 50,000 people, breaking the record of Hibari Misora, whose funeral was attended by 42,000 people. After his death, his single &quot;Pink Spider&quot; and album &quot;Ja, Zoo&quot; were certified million-sellers by the Recording Industry Association of Japan.

Johnny &amp; Associates produced many all-male groups: SMAP, Tokio, V6, KinKi Kids and Arashi. SMAP hit the J-pop scene in a major way in the 1990s through a combination of TV &quot;Tarento&quot; shows and singles, with one of its singers, Takuya Kimura, becoming a popular actor commonly known as &quot;Kimutaku&quot; in later years.

By the late 1990s, the girl group Speed was very popular; they announced their disbandment in 1999. The group returned to the music scene in 2008. Another all-female band, Morning Musume, produced by Tsunku, former leader of band Sharam Q became very popular, with a string of releases that were sales hits before even being released. The group&#x27;s popularity gave origin to the Hello! Project. Following the pattern set a decade before by the 1980s all-female Onyanko Club, Morning Musume spawned several splinter bands.

In the late 1990s and early 21st century, female singers such as Hikaru Utada, Ayumi Hamasaki, Misia, Mai Kuraki, and Ringo Shiina became chart-toppers who write their own songs or their own lyrics. Hikaru Utada is the daughter of Keiko Fuji, a popular singer of the 1970s. Ayumi Hamasaki was made Utada&#x27;s contemporary rival, though both women claimed the &quot;competition&quot; was merely a creation of their record companies and the media.

Zeebra introduced hip hop music to Japanese mainstream music. In 1999, was featured by Dragon Ash in their song titled &quot;Grateful Days&quot;, which topped the Oricon charts.

===2000s: Diversification===
====Avex group====

Ayumi Hamasaki won Grand Prix awards for three consecutive years—the first time in Japan Record Award history—between 2001 and 2003. Although Hamasaki became very famous, Tom Yoda, then-chairman of her record company Avex Group, argued that her tactics were risky, because Avex disregarded the modern portfolio theory. This concern disappeared when the company&#x27;s other singers (such as Ai Otsuka, Kumi Koda, and Exile) also reached a certain level of popularity in the mid-2000s under Yoda&#x27;s management policy. BoA, a Korean singer also a part of Avex group, also achieved high levels of success although being Korean in Japan. She opened the Hallyu door to other Korean artists so that they may achieve varying levels of success in Japan as well.

====&quot;Chaku-uta&quot;====

In December 2002, the digital-download market for was created by mobile-phone company au. The market for digital downloads grew rapidly, and Hikaru Utada&#x27;s 2007 song &quot;Flavor of Life&quot; sold over 7 million downloaded copies. In October 2007, EMI Music Japan announced that Utada was the world&#x27;s first artist to have 10 million digital sales in one year. According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry&#x27;s 2009 digital music report, Thelma Aoyama&#x27;s digital single &quot;Soba ni Iru ne&quot; and Greeeen&#x27;s digital single &quot;Kiseki&quot; sold 8.2 million copies and 6.2 million copies, respectively, in the 2008 download rankings.

====Japanese hip hop and urban pop====

In the first decade of the 21st century, hip hop music and contemporary R&amp;B influences in Japanese music started to gain attention in popular mainstream music. In November 2001, R&amp;B duo Chemistry&#x27;s debut album &quot;The Way We Are&quot; sold over 1.14 million copies in the first week, and debuted at the number-one position on the Oricon weekly album charts. Hip hop bands such as Rip Slyme and Ketsumeishi were also at the top of the Oricon charts. Rock band Orange Range featured several elements of hip hop in their music. Orange Range&#x27;s album &quot;musiQ&quot; sold over 2.6 million copies, making it the number one album of 2005 on the Oricon charts.

Pop/R&amp;B singer Ken Hirai topped the Oricon yearly album chart in 2006 with the release of his greatest hits album &quot;10th Anniversary Complete Single Collection &#x27;95-&#x27;05 Utabaka&quot;, selling over 2 million copies. The pop/hip-hop duo, Halcali, have the honor of being the first Japanese female hip-hop artists to break the Oricon top 10 charts. They have also performed overseas two times in 2008, once at the Anime Central festival in Chicago, and once more at Central Park, NYC on Japan Day. Exile, the dance-vocal group under Avex&#x27;s sublabel Rhythm Zone, had several million-seller albums. Their album &quot;Exile Love&quot; topped the Oricon yearly album chart in 2008. Veteran rapper Dohzi-T collaborated with popular singers such as Shota Shimizu, Hiromi Go, Miliyah Kato, and Thelma Aoyama in his successful 2008 album &quot;12 Love Stories&quot;. Although there were only 132 new artists in Japan in 2001, according to the Recording Industry Association of Japan, the number increased to 512 in 2008. In 2008, 14 new artists, such as Thelma Aoyama, attended the NHK Kōhaku Uta Gassen for the first time.

====Popularity of live performances and veteran musicians====

Rock musicians such as Mr. Children, B&#x27;z, Southern All Stars, L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel, and Glay still topped the charts in the first decade of the 21st century. Mr. Children&#x27;s song &quot;Sign&quot; won the Grand Prix award at the 46th Japan Record Awards in 2004. When the group released their album &quot;Home&quot; in 2007, they passed 50 million albums and singles sold, making them the second-highest selling artist of all time in Japan since the origin of Oricon—just behind B&#x27;z, who held the number-one position with more than 75 million records sold until then. &quot;Home&quot; topped the 2007 Oricon yearly album charts.

The sales of physical CDs declined, but audiences to see live performances increased. Eikichi Yazawa took part in rock festivals, and, in 2007, he became the first artist to have performed 100 concerts at the Nippon Budokan.

Other artists, such as Namie Amuro, also continued their long-running careers with successful releases in this period. Her live tour, Namie Amuro Best Fiction tour 2008-2009, not only became the biggest live tour by a Japanese solo female artist—attended by 450,000 fans in Japan—but was also attended by 50,000 fans in Taiwan and Shanghai. While Kazumasa Oda&#x27;s 2005 album &quot;Sōkana&quot; topped the Oricon weekly album charts, his 2007 single &quot;Kokoro&quot; reached the weekly single charts, breaking Yujiro Ishihara&#x27;s record and making him the then-oldest singer to top the single charts. Mariya Takeuchi&#x27;s greatest hits album &quot;Expressions&quot; topped the Oricon album chart in 2008, making her the oldest female singer with the longest active career to reach the number-one position.

====Johnny &amp; Associates====
Johnny &amp; Associates&#x27;s all-male groups remained well-known. In 2001, SMAP released their greatest-hits album &quot;SMAP Vest&quot;, which sold over a million copies in the first week. In November 2001, Johnny &amp; Associates established the label J Storm for their band Arashi. SMAP&#x27;s 2003 single &quot;Sekai ni hitotsu dake no hana&quot; sold more than two million copies, being the number-one single in the Oricon yearly single charts for that year. In 2007, Guinness World Records honored KinKi Kids for holding a world record for the number of singles debuting at the number-one position since their debut: 25. SMAP was said to fight a lonely battle at the Kōhaku Uta Gassen, as seen from the viewpoint of its audience share. In 2008, male musicians established a record of four consecutive wins at the Kōhaku Uta Gassen. Arashi&#x27;s greatest hits album &quot;All the Best! 1999–2009&quot; topped the 2009 Oricon yearly album charts.

Johnny &amp; Associates also produced new groups such as Hey! Say! JUMP, Tackey &amp; Tsubasa, NEWS, Kanjani Eight, and KAT-TUN. In 2006, KAT-TUN&#x27;s debut single &quot;Real Face&quot;, written by Shikao Suga and composed by Tak Matsumoto, sold over one million copies and topped the Oricon Yearly Charts. In 2007, temporary Johnny&#x27;s Jr. group Hey! Say! 7 broke a record as the youngest male group to ever top Oricon charts, with an average age of 14.8 years. Later that year, Hey! Say! JUMP broke a record as the largest group to debut in Johnny&#x27;s history, with ten members. They also became the youngest group ever to perform in Tokyo Dome with the average age of 15.7 years old. On the 2008 yearly singles charts, only one single ranked in the top 30 was sung by a female (Namie Amuro&#x27;s single &quot;60s 70s 80s&quot;) except gender-mixed groups, partly because the boy bands enjoyed an advantage in physical single sales. In 2009, Johnny&#x27;s Jr. artist Yuma Nakayama w/B.I.Shadow became the youngest artist to have their first single to debut at the number-one spot, as the band had an average age of 14.6 years, breaking the former record set by female group Minimoni, 14.8 years.

====Cover versions and classical pop====
In February 2001, Ulfuls released their cover version of Kyu Sakamoto&#x27;s 1963 song &quot;Ashita Ga Arusa&quot;. Their cover version debuted at the number-five position, behind Utada, Kinki Kids, Hamasaki and Hirai. In March, Yoshimoto Kogyo&#x27;s special band &quot;Re: Japan&quot; also released their cover version of &quot;Ashita Ga Arusa&quot;. When Ulfuls&#x27;s cover version of this song remained at number eight, Re: Japan&#x27;s version topped the Oricon weekly single charts.

In 2003, Man Arai released the single &quot;Sen no Kaze ni Natte&quot; (&quot;As A Thousand Winds&quot;) based on the Western poem &quot;Do not stand at my grave and weep&quot;. In Japan, the poem was known for Rokusuke Ei&#x27;s reading at the funeral of Kyu Sakamoto in 1985. Japanese tenor singer Masafumi Akikawa covered the song in 2006. Akikawa&#x27;s cover version of the song became the first classical music single to top the Oricon charts, and sold over one million copies. On the 2007 Oricon Yearly Charts, the single became the best-selling physical single, scoring a victory over Utada&#x27;s &quot;Flavor of Life&quot;. Oricon claimed that the song was not J-pop. On the other hand, sheet music from the Zen-On Music Company Ltd classified the song as J-pop.

Hideaki Tokunaga covered many female songs on his cover album series, &quot;Vocalist&quot;. He released &quot;Vocalist&quot;, &quot;Vocalist 2&quot;, &quot;Vocalist 3&quot;, &quot;Vocalist 4&quot; and &quot;Vocalist Vintage (Vocalist 5)&quot; in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2010, and 2012 respectively. In August 2007, &quot;Vocalist 3&quot; became Oricon weekly number-one cover album with 2 weeks (tied the record in Japan), and in May 2010, &quot;Vocalist 4&quot; became the Japan first Oricon monthly number-one cover album.

In 2010, other singers also released cover albums of Japanese songs such as Juju&#x27;s &quot;Request&quot; and Kumi Koda&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. Superfly released a single that came with a cover album of Western rock songs, titled &quot;Wildflower &amp; Cover Songs: Complete Best &#x27;Track 3&#x27;&quot;, ultimately becoming the band&#x27;s third consecutive album to debut at number one on the Oricon weekly album charts.

====Influence from neofolk and neo Shibuya-kei====
Folk duos, such as 19, Yuzu and Kobukuro, became popular during the period. Their music was called &quot;neofolk&quot;. In October 2007, Kobukuro&#x27;s double-album &quot;All Singles Best&quot; became the first male album to ship three million copies in the 21st century in Japan. In January 2008, their album &quot;5296&quot; beat out Ayumi Hamasaki&#x27;s album &quot;Guilty&quot; on the Oricon charts, though she previously had eight consecutive number-one studio albums.

Electronic music bands such as Plus-Tech Squeeze Box and Capsule were called &quot;neo Shibuya-kei&quot;. Yasutaka Nakata, a member of Capsule, became the song producer for girl group Perfume. In April 2008, for the first time as a technopop band in 25 years since Yellow Magic Orchestra&#x27;s 1983 album &quot;Naughty Boys&quot;, Perfume achieved a number-one album &quot;Game&quot; on the Oricon charts. In July 2008, their single &quot;Love the World&quot; debuted at number one, making it the first technopop song to reach number one in Oricon history. Other Japanese female technopop artists soon followed, including Aira Mitsuki, immi, Mizca, SAWA, Saoriiiii, and Sweet Vacation.

====Anime music, image song and Vocaloid====
During the late 2000s and the early 2010s, the anime music industry, such as voice actors and image songs, added weight to Japanese music. Though anime music was formerly influenced by J-pop and &quot;visual kei&quot; music, Japanese indie music apparently influenced the genre at the 2006 FanimeCon. In 2007, after sampling voice actress Saki Fujita&#x27;s voice to develop it, Vocaloid Hatsune Miku was released, and many songs featuring Hatsune Miku were shown on the Nico Nico Douga. Some of the musicians featuring Hatsune Miku, such as Livetune and Supercell, joined large record companies in Japan. Livetune released &quot;Re: Package&quot; on Victor Entertainment on August 27, 2008, and Supercell released &quot;Supercell&quot; on Sony Music on March 4, 2009. The albums &quot;Re: Package&quot; and &quot;Supercell&quot; were not brought under the control of the copyright system of the Japanese Society for Rights of Authors, Composers and Publishers (JASRAC), breaking the tradition that the musicians under the major labels affiliated with the system.

In June 2009, voice actress Nana Mizuki&#x27;s album &quot;Ultimate Diamond&quot; became the first voice actor album to reach number one on the Oricon weekly charts. The fictional all female band Hōka-go Tea Time, from the anime series &quot;K-On!&quot;, released the mini-album &quot;Hōka-go Tea Time&quot; on July 22, 2009. The mini-album debuted at number one on the Oricon weekly album charts, becoming the first album by anime characters to reach number one. In May 2010, &quot;Exit Tunes Presents Vocalogenesis feat. Hatsune Miku&quot; became the first album featuring Vocaloids to reach number one on the Oricon weekly charts, replacing Hideaki Tokunaga&#x27;s &quot;Vocalist 4&quot;, which had topped the charts for four consecutive weeks.

===2010s: Popularity of idol groups===

Since the end of the 2000s, more and more idol groups have emerged. The high number of idol groups in the Japanese entertainment industry is sometimes called the &quot;Warring Idols Period&quot; (アイドル戦国時代, &quot;aidoru sengoku jidai&quot;), an allusion to the Sengoku-jidai. Some of the most successful groups during the 2010s include Hey! Say! JUMP, AKB48, Arashi, Kanjani Eight, Morning Musume, and Momoiro Clover Z.

Kyary Pamyu Pamyu, a Harajuku-based fashion model, made her musical debut in 2011 and gained international popularity with her debut single &quot;Pon Pon Pon&quot;, recognized by some Western celebrities such as Katy Perry and Ariana Grande. She is produced by Yasutaka Nakata, who also produces the group Perfume. She subsequently gained success through her songs &quot;Ninja Re Bang Bang&quot; and &quot;Fashion Monster&quot;. During 2014, about 486,000 people attended Momoiro Clover Z&#x27;s live concerts, which was the highest recorded concert attendance for any female musician in Japan.

In 2019, AKB48 announced the postponement of its general election, and Arashi announced the group&#x27;s hiatus.

====Age free music====
There have been attempts to create &quot;age free music&quot; (Japanese: エイジ・フリー・ミュージック) that is neither enka or kayōkyoku or J-pop, and therefore transcends generations. There was a campaign by 15 record companies. Age free music is supported by music critic , who has a radio programme called .

=== 2020s: Global popularity ===
Idol groups remained relevant in the 2020s. According to surveys in Japan for 2024, popular Japanese groups include , Number i, Naniwa Danshi, Snow Man, Fruits Zipper, and NiziU. Popular solo singers and duets include Yoasobi, Mrs. Green Apple, Creepy Nuts, and Ado. 

J-pop has begun to appear in global charts, although it had not had such popularity before. Yoasobi&#x27;s song &quot;Idol&quot; became the first Japanese song to reach number one on the Billboard Global Excl. U.S. chart, as well as on the Apple Music and YouTube Music charts. By 2024, Showa retro and other Japanese pop music has become particularly popular in South Korea. The main artists that lead the genre internationally during the decade include Yoasobi, Creepy Nuts, Ado, Fujii Kaze, LiSA, and King Gnu.

==Artists==
Some Japanese pop artists are extremely popular in Japan, and some also have fanbases in other countries—especially in Asia, but also in Western countries. They influence not only music, but also fashion. As of 2016, the top five best-selling artists in the Japanese Oricon charts history are B&#x27;z, Mr. Children, Ayumi Hamasaki, Southern All Stars, and Dreams Come True. Among the five, Hamasaki holds the record for being the only solo artist.

<text>A total of 103 executions have been recorded in New Mexico: four during the Spanish Colonial era (1598–1821), none during the Mexican era (1821–1846), 51 during the Territorial era (1846–1913), 20 by the U.S. Military during the Taos Rebellion (1847), 27 between 1913 and 1960, when the death penalty was removed except for the murder of a police officer, and one since 1976, when the death penalty was reinstated; it remained until March 18, 2009, when Governor Bill Richardson signed a bill abolishing capital punishment into law after many struggles with the issues in previous weeks. Following this repeal, Bernalillo County Sheriff Darren White began a campaign to reinstate the practice by referendum.

Ninety-four of the executions were by hanging, seven by electrocution, one by the lethal gas, and one by lethal injection. Two of the hanged, &quot;Black Jack&quot; Ketchum in 1901 and Lucius Hightower in 1916, were accidentally decapitated by the noose due to their weight. The death sentences of five convicts were commuted by Governor Toney Anaya in 1986, on the eve of Thanksgiving. 

The following is a list of the 28 executions carried out by the state of New Mexico since 1912.

<text>Gunter d&#x27;Alquen (24 October 1910 – 15 May 1998) was chief editor of the weekly &quot;Das Schwarze Korps&quot; (&quot;The Black Corps&quot;), the official newspaper of the Schutzstaffel (SS), and commander of the SS-Standarte Kurt Eggers.

== Early life ==
Gunter d&#x27;Alquen was born to a Catholic-Freemason wool merchant and reserve officer named Carl d&#x27;Alquen, in Essen on 24 October 1910. He attended grammar school in Essen and joined the Hitler Youth in 1925. In 1927, d&#x27;Alquen became a member of the SA and as a 16-year-old joined the NSDAP.

D&#x27;Alquen was active in the National Socialist German Student Union. He became a member of the SS on 10 April 1931. He did not complete his studies in history and philology and instead turned to a journalistic career. From 1932, he was a political correspondent to the editorial board of the &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot; (&quot;Völkisch Observer&quot;). It was here he aroused the attention of Heinrich Himmler, who appointed him chief editor of &quot;Das Schwarze Korps&quot; in March 1935.

== As chief editor ==
D&#x27;Alquen&#x27;s newspaper often attacked intellectuals, students, Freemasons, certain scientists, rebellious businessmen, traffickers, clerics and other representatives of German society that had aroused Himmler&#x27;s anger. With its notorious anti-Semitism, &quot;Das Schwarze Korps&quot; established itself as a moral spokesperson of Nazi beliefs.

From September 1939, d&#x27;Alquen became a prominent SS war correspondent. He was appointed head of the propaganda formation SS-Standarte Kurt Eggers named after Kurt Eggers, a friend of d&#x27;Alquen, an SS war correspondent and editor of &quot;Das Schwarze Korps&quot; who was killed in action in 1943.

== As a prisoner of war ==
In May 1945, d&#x27;Alquen was taken as a prisoner of war by the British Army. He was held at &quot;Camp 18&quot;, a prisoner-of-war camp on the grounds of Featherstone Castle in Northumberland, England. D&#x27;Alquen was released from custody in 1948.

== Later life ==
After the war, d&#x27;Alquen denied any knowledge of Nazi extermination camps. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison.

According to de-classified Central Intelligence Agency documents, as part of Operation Paperclip; d&#x27;Alquen was employed by the Counterintelligence Corps and was widely believed to have later been on a CIA payroll during the Cold War.

In July 1955, d&#x27;Alquen was sentenced by a Berlin Denazification court to pay a fine of 60,000 DM, followed by a loss of pension rights for three years. He was found guilty of having played a significant role in wartime propaganda and incitement against churches, Jews, and foreigners in the Nazi state. After further investigation of d&#x27;Alquen&#x27;s income from this activity, he was sentenced to pay another fine of 28,000 DM in January 1958.

According to British intelligence, he was a member of the Naumann Circle, headed by former State Secretary Werner Naumann, which attempted to infiltrate the Free Democratic Party. In the late 1950s, d&#x27;Alquen became a shareholder of a weaving mill in Mönchengladbach.

He died on 15 May 1998 in Mönchengladbach.

Alvensleben was born in Halle in the Prussian Province of Saxony into the noble family von Alvensleben. His father was Prussian Major General Ludolf von Alvensleben (1844–1912). Ludolf&#x27;s father had already retired from active service to administer the family&#x27;s manor around Schochwitz Castle, which had been inherited from Alvensleben&#x27;s grandfather, the Prussian general Hermann von Alvensleben (1809–1887).

Alvensleben enlisted in the Prussian cadet corps in 1911, and in 1918 joined the 10th (Magdeburg) Hussars Regiment, but did not fight in World War I. He was briefly a member in a paramilitary &quot;Freikorps&quot; unit in 1920. Between 1923 and July 1929, he was a member of the nationalist &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot; organization. Upon the death of his father in December 1912, he inherited the family&#x27;s manor at Schochwitz. He wed Melitta von Guaita on 3 May 1924; the marriage produced four children. He also later fathered a natural son raised as a &quot;Lebensborn&quot; child.

==Nazi party and SS career==

Alvensleben joined the NSDAP and SA in 1929. He soon became head of the local branch in Eisleben and chief district official in Mansfeld Land. From July 1931, he chaired the motorized corps of the SA in the &quot;Gau&quot; of Halle-Merseburg. Alvensleben left the SA in 1932; at that time he was heavily indebted and had a considerable criminal record on charges which included libel and road traffic offence.

After the &quot;Machtergreifung&quot;, he and &quot;Gauleiter&quot; Rudolf Jordan on 12 February 1933, organized a violent attack of SA and SS paramilitaries on Communist officials in Eisleben, whereby three men were killed and many others injured, an event later known as Eisleben Bloody Sunday. In March 1933, Alvensleben became a member of the provincial diet and of the Prussian Landtag; from 12 November 1933, he also was a member of the Reichstag.

On 5 April 1934, he joined the SS and became commander of the 46th Regiment in Dresden in the rank of &quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot;. On 22 August 1934, Alvensleben received a reprimand by &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler for having insulted a woman in Leipzig in April. From 1 October 1935, he assumed the leadership of the 26th SS-Regiment in his hometown Halle. His advancement continued: he became commander of SS-District X in Stuttgart on 20 September 1936 and commander of SS-District XXXIII in Schwerin on 1 July 1937.

Alvensleben&#x27;s career continued after the 1939 Invasion of Poland as commander of the &quot;Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz&quot; (&#x27;German Self-Defense&#x27;) organization in what was to become the newly established Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia. He told his men on 16 October 1939:
The &quot;Selbstschutz&quot; paramilitary forces, formed by members of the German minority in Poland and led by SS officials, performed mass executions during the &quot;Intelligenzaktion Pommern&quot; in the &quot;Fordon Valley of Death&quot;, the Massacres in Piaśnica, and other atrocities. In a letter to Himmler, Alvensleben complained about scrupulous Wehrmacht officers too weak to take drastic measures. In 1939 he confiscated the Jewish-owned manors of Rucewo and Rucewko in Reichsgau Wartheland.
In December 1939, Alvensleben was appointed member-of-staff at the command of Friedrich-Wilhelm Krüger, the SS and Police Leader in Kraków, General Government. On 23 May 1940, he was promoted to the rank of &quot;Hauptsturmführer&quot; in the Waffen-SS. From February 1941 he was in service of the Reich Security Main Office, assumed the SS and Police Leader command in Chernigov on 22 October 1941 and of Simferopol in Crimea on 19 November. In 1942, Alvensleben was SS inspector of the &quot;Durchgangsstrasse&quot; IV, a large forced labor project to build a road from Lemberg to Stalino (now Donetsk). From 6 October 1943, he held this position in Nikolaev in the rank of Major General, officially assigned to Army Group A; his tenure was accompanied by irregularities and further mass executions.

On 19 February 1944, he succeeded Udo von Woyrsch as Higher SS and Police Leader in Dresden. He took the occasion to take action against his creditors, such as Carl Wentzel who was denounced after the 20 July plot, arrested and executed, whereafter Alvensleben was able to release his heavily indebted manor in Schochwitz. In the late days of the war, he left Dresden and fled to the West.

==Post-war escape==

In April 1945, Alvensleben was apprehended by British forces. At the end of 1945, he escaped from the internment camp at Neuengamme in Hamburg. After a short stay in Schochwitz, he fled with his family to Argentina in early 1946. Although there is no precise data on when they arrived in the country, according to a 2000 documentary film, the government of Juan Perón granted Alvensleben citizenship under the name of Carlos Lücke on 27 November 1952. He lived in Buenos Aires until July 1956 and then moved to Santa Rosa de Calamuchita. From November 1952, he served as inspector of fish farming. A Polish court sentenced Alvensleben to death &quot;in absentia&quot;.

In January 1964, the district court of Munich issued an arrest warrant for Alvensleben for the killing of at least 4,247 people in Poland by units of the Selbstschutz under Alvensleben&#x27;s command in late 1939. Attempts by the prosecution had no consequences for Alvensleben and he died in 1970 in Argentina, without having been brought to trial.

<doc id="414097" wikidata="Q2089004" url="?curid=414097" title="Esgaroth">
<text>Esgaroth, or Lake-town, is a fictional community of Men upon the Long Lake that appears in the 1937 novel &quot;The Hobbit&quot; by J. R. R. Tolkien. Constructed entirely of wood and standing upon wooden pillars sunk into the lake-bed, the town is south of the Lonely Mountain and east of Mirkwood. The town&#x27;s prosperity is apparently built upon trade between the Men who inhabit it, and the Elves and the Dwarves of northern Middle-earth. The chief mode of transport of the people of Esgaroth is stated to be their boats.

At the time in which &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is set, Esgaroth appears to be a city-state, and a republic with no king (the only real republic shown in Middle-earth). The Master of Lake-town was said in-universe to be elected from among the &quot;old and wise&quot;; scholars have noted that all the same, he was trapped by his greed. Tolkien modelled the town closely on the real neolithic pile dwellings that were discovered near the Alps in the 19th century.

== Fictional role ==

=== Geography ===

Esgaroth was located in north-eastern Wilderland, a large inland region of Middle-earth. It was situated on the western shores of the Long Lake, close to the inflow of the Forest River. The Forest River provided an upstream route to Mirkwood. The Lonely Mountain, which could be seen from the town and could be reached by travelling up the Long Lake and then up its northern inflow, the River Running (also called the Celduin). The River Running flowed out of the south of the lake, providing a travel route from Esgaroth all the way downstream to the land of Dorwinion on the Sea of Rhûn. It had been preceded by a larger town, also built over the lake on piles that could still be seen during droughts, but Tolkien never wrote any further account of this.

=== Language ===

The inhabitants of Esgaroth knew the language spoken by most of Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth, Westron. Amongst themselves they spoke an ancient form of it, which was loosely related to (but distinct from) the also-ancient language of the Rohirrim. Tolkien &quot;translated&quot; Westron into English in his text, so to represent the ancient relative of it that the Rohirrim spoke, he substituted Old English. Thus, Tolkien substituted Old Norse for the language of the Men of Esgaroth (in person and place names, etc.) because it is an ancient relative of Old English.

=== Master of Lake-town ===

&quot;Master of Lake-town&quot; is the title given to the elected leader of Esgaroth. The Master of the town when Bilbo and Thorin&#x27;s Company arrived in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was portrayed as a capable businessman, but more than a little greedy and cowardly. He was stated as having run off with a large amount of gold and dying in the epilogue.

== Concept and artwork ==

Tolkien made a series of drawings of Bilbo&#x27;s escape from the Elves, as he floated with the Dwarves in barrels down to Esgaroth. The finished drawing shows a town on wooden piles above the lake, accessed by a walkway. He modelled the town closely on the neolithic pile dwellings that have been found on Swiss lakes, probably based on an artist&#x27;s conception of such a town such as in Robert Munro&#x27;s 1908 &quot;Les stations lacustres d&#x27;Europe aux ages de la pierre et du bronze&quot;. The scholars Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull note that in an earlier drawing, two Dwarves can be seen crawling out of their barrels, with Bilbo still invisible as he was wearing the Ring, whereas the finished drawing shows the barrels without Dwarves, perhaps at the moment just before Bilbo started to let them out; an Elf, poling the raft, has been added. The text of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; states that night had fallen and the Men of the town had gone indoors to eat, while in the drawing, it is still day and swan-headed boats (based, they note, on those in Tolkien&#x27;s painting &quot;The Halls of Manwë&quot; for &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;) are still being rowed about the lake.

== Fictional etymology ==

Compared to Dale, the other town in the valley of the River Running, Esgaroth is the more &quot;mannish&quot; and vernacular settlement. Its masters do not have any elvish-sounding names as the former kings of Dale, nor is Esgaroth a monarchy. This stems from the fact that in the past, Esgaroth was less influenced by the refined Númenorean civilisation than Dale.

The meaning of the name &quot;Esgaroth&quot; is unclear. While it is not Sindarin, one of Tolkien&#x27;s elvish languages, it may be &quot;&#x27;Sindarized&#x27; in shape&quot; as the author himself explained. In early manuscripts, Tolkien provides a root &quot;esek&quot; meaning &quot;sedge&quot; or &quot;reed&quot; in the early Elvish language of Ilkorin, but reeds are not mentioned in the description of Lake-town that was published in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. The name has been compared to the Sumerian word &quot;gi&quot; meaning reed.

== Analysis ==

Douglas A. Anderson notes in &quot;The Annotated Hobbit&quot; that Lake-town&#x27;s Master and councillors possibly derive from Robert Browning&#x27;s &quot;Mayor and Corporation&quot; in his 1842 poem &quot;The Pied Piper of Hamelin&quot;. Anderson comments that Tolkien &quot;loathed&quot; the poem, and that in 1931 he wrote a satirical poem called &quot;Progress in Bimble Town&quot; dedicated to the &quot;Mayor and Corporation&quot;.

Esgaroth has been interpreted as Tolkien&#x27;s criticism of capitalism featuring a ruling elite class that exploits the lower-class citizens. The human Master of Lake-Town, like the Dwarf Thorin Oakenshield who has become obsessed with the dragon&#x27;s hoard, and the dragon Smaug himself, may all three be seen as illustrations of the &quot;greedy, destructive side of capitalism&quot;. The Master, however, is rather trapped in his monotonic life of bureaucracy and cronyism, since he is both the chief capitalist and chief politician of the town. On the other hand, Esgaroth does not abandon capitalism after the destruction of Smaug. While the town experiences a new prosperity, the &quot;managerial class&quot; of merchants is not replaced. Although he portrays the highly capitalistical town in a bad light, Tolkien does not advocate a socialist system for the reconstructed Lake-town either. Instead the town&#x27;s situation at the end of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; has been called an &quot;orderly liberty&quot;.

The archaeologist Deborah Sabo, in &quot;Mythlore&quot;, calls the description of Lake-town as Bilbo arrives there &quot;perhaps Tolkien&#x27;s most vivid attempt to model a place in Middle-earth on real-world archaeology&quot;. She notes that pile dwellings were discovered at Lake Zurich in 1853–1854 when the water level was unusually low; Ferdinand Keller proposed that the village had been constructed on a platform on piles over the lake, creating &quot;a sensation&quot;. By 1900, some hundreds of lake villages had been identified from Britain and Europe, and in a &quot;lake-dwelling craze&quot;, children&#x27;s books and newspaper and magazine articles provided pictures and descriptions of lake villages. In addition, Sabo writes that Tolkien characteristically viewed the past as far better than the present, and that after Smaug has fallen, dying, on the town, destroying it, people avoid the place: &quot;few dared to cross the cursed spot, and none dared to dive into the shivering water or recover the precious stones that fell from his rotting carcase.&quot; She states that in this passage, Tolkien is projecting the tale into the future, when the new town too will be an archaeological site, complete with folklore beliefs about a haunted place containing bones, jewels, and the remains of the piles of the town.

It has been observed that there is an internal division in the minds of the people of Esgaroth. What they remember of the town&#x27;s glorious past is preserved in songs and tales, but this lore is not considered actual history by the people but rather fiction. A few songs looked into the future foretelling the return of the dwarven kings and a new age of prosperity. The unexpected arrival of Thorin therefore causes great excitement among the Esgarothians who immerse &quot;themselves in a fantasy that is only tangentially connected to the old prophecies ... and is almost completely detached from the world around them.&quot; The practical Master is capable of adapting to this new situation by assisting in the composition of new songs from which he profits. Eventually it is Bard though whose voice in the battle against the dragon is the voice of legend when he is revealed as the direct heir of Girion, Lord of Dale.


==In other media==

In Peter Jackson&#x27;s 2012–2014 &quot;The Hobbit&quot; film series, Stephen Fry plays the role of the Master of Lake-town in &quot;The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies&quot;. 

In the 2006 strategy game &quot;The Battle for Middle-Earth II&quot;, the settlement of Esgaroth is featured in the campaign and available for skirmish.

<text>Max Amann (24 November 1891 – 30 March 1957) was a high-ranking member of the Nazi Party, a German politician, businessman and art collector, including of looted art. He was the first business manager of the Nazi Party and later became the head of (Eher Publishing), the official Nazi Party publishing house. He was also the &quot;Reichsleiter&quot; for the press. After the war ended, Amann was arrested by U.S. military occupation authorities. A denazification court deemed him a (Major Offender). Amann was sentenced to ten years in a labour camp and stripped of his property, pension rights, and virtually all of his fortune.

Amann was released from custody in 1953, and died in poverty in Munich four years later.

==Early life==
Amann was born in Munich on 24 November 1891. After attending volksschule and a business school, he worked for a few years as a commercial office apprentice and a salesman. He then enlisted in the 1st Royal Bavarian Infantry Regiment in October 1912. When the First World War broke out he was transferred to the 16th Royal Bavarian Infantry Regiment and obtained the rank of &quot;Feldwebel&quot; (equivalent to the US Army staff sergeant). Amann was Adolf Hitler&#x27;s company sergeant, and was thus an early acquaintance of Hitler long before his rise to prominence in German politics. He was awarded the Iron Cross second class during the war. He was discharged in December 1919.

==Nazi career==
Amann joined the Nazi Party (NSDAP) in October 1921, as the Party&#x27;s first business manager, and held NSDAP membership number 3. After 1922, he also led the Nazis&#x27; sole publishing house, Eher Verlag. Eher Verlag published, among other imprints, the antisemitic satirical magazine &quot;Die Brennessel&quot; and the SS magazine &quot;Das Schwarze Korps&quot; (&quot;The Black Corps&quot;). Amann took part in the November 1923 Beer Hall Putsch and in April 1924 was sentenced to four-and-a-half months in Landsberg Prison. During the period when the Nazi Party was banned, Amann was a leading member of the Greater German People&#x27;s Community, a Nazi front organization headquartered in Munich. In November 1924 he was elected as a NSDAP candidate to the Munich city council, serving until 1933. When the Nazi Party was reestablished on 27 February 1925, Amann immediately rejoined it.

Amann&#x27;s most notable contribution was persuading Hitler to retitle his first book from &quot;Viereinhalb Jahre (des Kampfes) gegen Lüge, Dummheit und Feigheit&quot;, (&quot;Four and a Half Years (of Struggle) Against Lies, Stupidity and Cowardice&quot;) to &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, (&quot;My Struggle&quot;) which he also published. The book became a major source of Eher-Verlag&#x27;s income and Amann oversaw the book through many editions. He helped Hitler become a wealthy man. Amann also enriched himself through many Nazi publications. Amann published the daily &quot;Volkischer Beobachter&quot;, the weekly &quot;Illustrierter Beobachter&quot; and the &quot;Nationalsozialistische Monatshefte&quot;.

After the Nazi seizure of power, Hitler appointed him a &quot;Reichsleiter&quot;, the second highest political rank in the Nazi Party on 2 June 1933. On 15 November 1933, Hitler named Amann the president of the Reich Press Chamber (&quot;Reichspressekammer&quot;) and Reich Press Leader. Also on that day, Amann was elected to the &quot;Reichstag&quot; from electoral constituency 24, Upper Bavaria-Swabia. Amann joined the SS on 15 March 1932 with the rank of SS-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot;, was promoted to SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; on 30 January 1936 and was assigned to the staff of the &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot;.

Amann pursued a dual-pronged strategy to establish Nazi control over the press industry. In his official role as president of the Press Chamber, Amann had the power to seize or close down any newspapers that either ran counter to the Nazis&#x27; wishes or did not fully support the Nazi regime. Then, as head of the Eher-Verlag, he bought them at a substantial discount–often at &quot;auctions&quot; at which the Eher-Verlag was the sole bidder. By 1942, Amann controlled 80% of all German newspapers through his publishing empire. Combined with the proceeds from &quot;Mein Kampf,&quot; this made the Eher-Verlag the largest newspaper and publishing company in Germany, and one of the largest in the world. His income increased from in 1934 to in 1944.

As a party official Amann lacked talent, being a poor speaker and debater. In addition, his handwriting was illegible, thus his Chief of Staff and deputy, Rolf Rienhardt, performed these duties for him. Poor handwriting can be attributed in part to the loss of his left arm in an accident with a firearm while hunting with Franz Ritter von Epp on 4 September 1931.

Arrested by American troops after the war ended, Amann was deemed a &quot;Hauptschuldiger&quot; (Major Offender) and sentenced to ten years in a labour camp on 8 September 1948. He was released in 1953, but was stripped of his property, pension rights and practically all of his fortune. Amann died on 30 March 1957, in Munich.

==Nazi-looted art==

In 2014, the Bavarian State Painting Collections discovered in the Pinakothek der Moderne&#x27;s collection 14 art works that they suspected had belonged to Amann. The Pinakothek received the artworks in 1945 and could not detail their provenance enough to say whether they were looted or not. The German Lost Art Foundation listed the 10 paintings and 4 sculptures, which included works from Gabriel Mäleßkircher, Franz von Stuck, Friedrich Kaulbach and others, in the lostart.de database.

<text>A rubāʿī (, from Arabic ; plural: ) or chahārgāna(e) () is a poem or a verse of a poem in Persian poetry (or its derivative in English and other languages) in the form of a quatrain, consisting of four lines (four hemistichs).

In classical Persian poetry, the &quot;ruba&#x27;i&quot; is written as a four-line (or two-couplet / two-distich) poem, with a rhyme-scheme AABA or AAAA.

This is an example of a &quot;ruba&#x27;i&quot; from Rumis&#x27;s &quot;Divan-e Shams&quot;:
:
:

:May the splendors of Salahuddin be roused, 
:And poured into the eyes and souls of the lovers. 
:May every soul that has become refined and has surpassed refinement 
:Be mingled with the dust of Salahuddin!

==Metre==

The usual metre of a Persian &quot;ruba&#x27;i&quot;, which is used for all four lines of the above quatrain by Rumi, is, as follows:
: – – u u – u – u – – u u –

In the above scheme, quantitatively, &quot;–&quot; represents a long syllable, and &quot;u&quot; a short one. As variations of this scheme, any sequence of – u, except the final syllable of each line, can be replaced by a single &quot;overlong&quot; syllable, such as &quot;gēkh&quot;, &quot;tīf&quot;, &quot;luṭf&quot; in the poem above, containing either a long vowel followed by a consonant other than &quot;n&quot;, or a short vowel followed by two consonants. An overlong syllable, as mentioned, can freely be substituted for the final syllable of the line, as with &quot;bād&quot; above.

Another variation, as a poetic licence rule, is that occasionally a sequence of two short syllables (u u) can be replaced by a single long one (–).

A third variation is to use the same metre as above, but with the sixth and seventh syllables reversed:
: – – u u – – u u – – u u –

==In English==
The verse form AABA as used in English verse is known as the Rubaiyat Quatrain due to its use by Edward FitzGerald in his famous 1859 translation, &quot;Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam&quot;. Algernon Charles Swinburne, one of the first admirers of FitzGerald&#x27;s translation of Khayyam&#x27;s medieval Persian verses, was the first to imitate the stanza form, which subsequently became popular and was used widely, as in the case of Robert Frost&#x27;s 1922 poem &quot;Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening&quot;.

FitzGerald&#x27;s translation became so popular by the turn of the century that hundreds of American humorists wrote parodies using the form and, to varying degrees, the content of his stanzas, including &quot;The Rubaiyat of Ohow Dryyam&quot;, &quot;The Rubáiyát of a Persian Kitten&quot;, &quot;The Rubaiyat of Omar Cayenne&quot; and &quot;The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam Jr.&quot;

In extended sequences of &quot;ruba&#x27;i&quot; stanzas, the convention is sometimes extended so that the unrhymed line of the current stanza becomes the rhyme for the following stanza. The structure can be made cyclical by linking the unrhymed line of the final stanza back to the first stanza: ZZAZ. These more stringent systems were not, however, used by FitzGerald in his &quot;Rubaiyat&quot;.

<text>Benno von Arent (19 July 1898 – 14 October 1956) was a German film director, artist, architect, designer and a member of the Nazi Party and SS.

== Early life ==
Arent was born Benno Georg Eduard Wilhelm Joachim von Arent in Görlitz on 19 July 1898, the son of a Prussian Lieutenant Colonel also named Benno von Arent (1868–1904) and grandson of a Prussian Lieutenant General likewise named Benno von Arent.

Arent fought in the First World War and then joined the Freikorps and Reichswehr. In the time of high unemployment he had a number of jobs including car salesman, while teaching himself to be an architect. In 1923, he worked as an outfitter in various theatres across Berlin, initially without success. He also became a member of the völkisch-minded and anti-Semitic Militant League for German Culture.

== Career ==
In 1931, he joined the SS and 1932 in the NSDAP. That same year, he became one of the founders of the &quot;Bund nationalsozialistischer Bühnen- und Filmkünstler&quot; (&quot;Union of National Socialist Stage and Movie Artists&quot;), which was renamed &quot;Kameradschaft der Deutschen Künstler&quot; (&quot;Fellowship of German Artists&quot;) after Hitler&#x27;s rise to power in 1933.

After some personal assignments for Adolf Hitler in 1936, Arent was appointed &quot;Reichsbühnenbildner&quot; (&quot;Reich Stage Designer&quot;), a title intended primarily to underscore Arent&#x27;s exemplary position as a set designer and outfitter. Occasionally, Hitler imposed his own stage designs in a kind of teacher-student relationship, a relationship that would greatly benefit Arent&#x27;s career. Hitler described him as one of the greatest stage designers. Arent, whose artistic views were shared and probably influenced by Hitler, favored a realistic, often monumental style in his own sets and costumes. Nevertheless, he was ultimately unable to develop his own style, partly due to the outbreak of World War II, and because of competition in his field of expertise.

His task as a designer of street decorations during major marches also had an effect on his stage style. He was also the designer of the diplomatic uniforms for the Foreign Ministry. On 20 April 1937, he received the title of professor, like many other leading Nazi culture officials. In addition to his party responsibilities, Arent continued to work as an architect. His most famous work was the design of the Berlin House of the German Labour Front (DAF). In the spring of 1939, Arent was appointed &quot;Reich Commissioner for Fashion&quot;, an office that was soon terminated due to the war.

== Wartime years and death ==
During World War II, Arent, who had been a member of the SS since 1931, joined the staff of Heinrich Himmler. On 15 August 1941, he witnessed the murder of partisans and Jews near Minsk. In 1944, he fought in the Waffen-SS and was appointed &quot;SS-Oberführer.&quot; Near the end of the war, he fell into Soviet captivity, from which he was released in 1953. In 1956, a denazification process was started against Arent in Berlin. Shortly after his sentencing, Arent died in Bonn, West Germany.

<text>The Catholic Church in Nigeria is part of the worldwide Catholic Church, under the spiritual leadership of the Pope, the curia in Rome, and the Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference of Nigeria (CBCN).

In 2022, the president of the CBCN is Lucius Iwejuru Ugorji, Archbishop of Owerri Archdiocese. He followed on from the previous president, Augustine Obiora Akubeze.

==Overview==

The Latin and Eastern Catholic Churches comprise the world&#x27;s largest Christian Church and the largest religious grouping globally. In 2005, there were an estimated 19 million baptised Catholics in Nigeria. In 2010, the Catholic population accounted for approximately 12.6% of the population, 70% of which can be found in Southeast Nigeria.

Historically, the Holy Ghost Fathers maintained a strong presence in Igboland in today&#x27;s Southeastern Nigeria, whereas the White Fathers operated in Western and Northern Nigeria, and the Society of African Missions in Lagos.

Nigeria, together with Congo Democratic Republic, boasts of the highest number of priests in Africa. The boom in vocation to the priesthood in Nigeria is mainly in the Southeastern part, especially among the Igbo ethnic group, of which the first evangelizers were Holy Ghost Fathers.

The second papal visit to the country in 1998 witnessed the beatification of Blessed Cyprian Michael Iwene Tansi. Pope John Paul II proclaimed him blessed at Oba, Onitsha Archdiocese, a local Church established by the apostle of eastern Nigerian, Bishop Joseph Shanahan, CSSp.

The official patron saints of Nigeria are Mary, Queen of Nigeria, and Patrick of Ireland.
==Demographics==
Christianity was followed by an estimated 46.18% of the Nigerian population in 2020; one-quarter of Christians in Nigeria are Catholic (12.39% of the country&#x27;s population).

In the same year, over 9,500 priests and 6,500 nuns served over 4,000 parishes.

<text>Heinz Auerswald (26 July 1908 – 5 December 1970) was a German lawyer and member of the SS in Nazi Germany, which he joined in 1933. In 1937 he became a member of the NSDAP.

== Early years ==
Heinz Auerswald was born on 26 July 1908 in Berlin He spent his youth with his mother and relatives in the countryside. He attended elementary school and upper secondary school in Berlin, before graduating in 1927. He then worked for 3 years at Knorr-Bremse in Berlin before starting law school, graduating with a doctorate.

== Career in the NSDAP ==
On 7 June 1933 he became a member of the SS. He was the German Commissioner of the Warsaw Ghetto (&quot;Kommissar für den jüdischen Wohnbezirk&quot;), from April 1941 to November 1942. While the Nazis depicted themselves as administrators and managers pursuing a would-be &quot;productionalist policy of economic independence providing the Ghetto with essential materials for its inhabitants continual survival until the adoption of the final solution&quot;, in reality they were already pursuing the Nazi goal of exterminating European Jewry through starvation, exposure and diseases induced by abysmal living conditions.

&quot;Overcrowding and food shortages led to an extremely high mortality rate in the ghetto. Almost 30 percent of the population of Warsaw was packed into 2.4 percent of the city&#x27;s area. The Germans set a food ration for Jews at just 181 calories a day. By August 1941, more than 5,000 people a month succumbed to starvation and disease.&quot;
At least one order given by Auerswald for the execution of Jews who had escaped the Ghetto from 17 October 1941, is extant. The mass deportations of Jews from the Ghetto to the Treblinka extermination camp on 22 July 1942 began while Auerswald was the Ghetto Commissioner.

== Later life ==
After the war, Auerswald was active as a lawyer in Düsseldorf. A late preliminary investigation into his participation in Nazi war crimes was initiated by the public prosecution in Dortmund, which was discontinued due to Auerswald&#x27;s death in 1970.

<doc id="414105" wikidata="Q63234" url="?curid=414105" title="Hans Aumeier">
<text>Hans Aumeier (20 August 1906 – 24 January 1948) was an SS commander during the Nazi era who was the commandant of Vaivara concentration camp and the deputy commandant of Auschwitz concentration camp. One of the most important criminals at Auschwitz, Aumeier was extradited to Poland, where he was convicted and sentenced to death. He was executed in 1948.

== Life before the war ==
Aumeier was born on 20 August 1906 in the small town of Amberg, Germany, where he attended elementary school for four years and then secondary school for just three years. In 1918, he left school without any qualifications to take up an apprenticeship as a turner and fitter in a local rifle factory, following his father’s career. In 1923, Aumeier left the small factory in Amberg and began work for a bigger company in Munich. In 1925, he tried to join the Reichswehr, but failed and returned to the rifle factory in Munich, but could not settle down, and after taking up similar positions in other factories in Berlin, Bremen and Cologne he became unemployed. Throughout the period 1926 to 1929, Aumeier moved from one job to another, taking part-time work and summer jobs in order to survive. He was an early member of the Nazi Party, joining in December 1929, and in 1931 he joined the SA and was soon employed as a driver at the SA headquarters in Berlin. In December 1931, Aumeier was transferred to the SS, where he worked in the garage as a driver and was on the staff of head of the SS, Heinrich Himmler.

== Auschwitz atrocities ==
On 1 February 1942, Aumeier was transferred to Auschwitz concentration camp and was appointed head of Department III, and named &quot;Schutzhaftlagerführer&quot; at Auschwitz I, where he remained until 16 August 1943. It was during this time at Auschwitz that Aumeier made a name for himself, responsible for many draconian methods, including torture, beatings, and executions. On 19 March 1942, 144 women were shot at the execution wall in the courtyard of Blocks 10 and 11 on Aumeier’s orders. On 27 May 1942, he was present again at a mass execution of 168 prisoners who were shot in the same manner.

===Corruption===
On 18 August 1943, Aumeier was found guilty of corrupt practices and theft of gold from the victims of gassing, and as a result, was transferred from Auschwitz on the personal orders of Commandant Rudolf Höß. According to an interrogation report, Aumeier stated that in May–June 1943 while still attached to Auschwitz he was ordered to report to the Higher SS and Police Leader “Ostland”, SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; Friedrich Jeckeln. He was attached to the SS-Construction Brigade of 5th SS Panzer Corps; this unit was responsible for building fortifications in the area Oranienbaum-Leningrad and was under the command of Organisation Todt. Aumeier would command a Jewish construction unit of some 7,000 men with orders to construct, and then establish Vaivara concentration camp in Estonia for Jews.

== Life after Auschwitz ==
After he was discharged from Auschwitz, Aumeier returned to Vaivara as commandant and remained there until August 1944, when the camp was evacuated and all his prisoners were made the responsibility of the commandant of Stutthof concentration camp. On 20 August Aumeier reported back to Jeckeln and found himself attached to a Police Battalion part of “Kampfgruppe (Battle Group) Jeckeln”, situated near Riga, Latvia. Here, Aumeier took part in his only frontline engagement with the enemy as his unit attempted to attack the Estonian island of Osel (Saaremaa) but was unsuccessful. What part he played in this attack is unclear.

In October 1944, shortly before the surrender of Riga, Aumeier was ordered to report to SS-Gruppenführer Richard Glücks at Oranienburg. He took this opportunity to ask Glücks if he could return to his old unit at Dachau concentration camp so he could visit his family. His request was granted, but he was taken ill with an old eye injury and was sent to the hospital; he remained there until January 1945. When Aumeier was finally discharged, he reported back to Oranienburg and was asked whether he wanted to go to occupied Norway to become commandant of a new concentration camp at Mysen. He asked for leave to see his family, but this time it was refused and he was told to report to SS-Sturmbannführer Max Pauly immediately who would brief him.

On 22 January Aumeier arrived in Oslo, met Pauly and was told he had to supervise the building of a camp to house approximately 3,000 prisoners to be used in slave labour. It seems that Aumeier managed to build this camp and his treatment of the prisoners was very different from that of how he treated the prisoners at Auschwitz. He worked closely with the Norwegian Red Cross and even let them into the camp. On 7 May 1945, Aumeier opened the camp and let the prisoners go free; by the next day the camp was empty.

== Trial and conviction ==
On 11 June 1945 Aumeier was arrested at Terningmoen camp as a result of information gleaned from Gestapo files obtained by the MI6. He was still in full SS uniform and admitted almost immediately his name and rank. He was handed over to United States intelligence officers at Akershus Prison for interrogation in August 1945. In 1946, he was extradited to Poland to face trial as a war criminal along with thirty-nine other members of the SS staff of Auschwitz-Birkenau, before the Supreme National Tribunal in Kraków. The trial lasted from 25 November to 16 December 1947, and Aumeier stated that if he was found guilty and sentenced to death, he would &quot;die as a &#x27;Sündenbock&#x27; (scapegoat) for Germany&quot;. He told the court that he had never killed anyone at Auschwitz and neither had any of his men and denied knowledge of the gas chambers. On 22 December Aumeier was sentenced to death, and he was hanged on 24 January 1948 in Montelupich Prison, Kraków.

He is known for playing Alex Rieger on the television comedy series &quot;Taxi&quot; (1978–1983), John Lacey on the NBC series &quot;Dear John&quot; (1988–1992), and Alan Eppes on the CBS series &quot;Numb3rs&quot; (2005–2010). He is also well known for his career in theatre and for his roles in films such as &quot;Ordinary People&quot; (1980), &quot;Running on Empty&quot; (1988), &quot;Independence Day&quot; (1996), &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; (2001), &quot;Independence Day: Resurgence&quot; (2016), &quot;Uncut Gems&quot; (2019), and &quot;The Fabelmans&quot; (2022).

Hirsch has twice won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, has twice won the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play, has won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Television Series – Musical or Comedy, and was nominated twice for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performances in &quot;Ordinary People&quot; (1980) and &quot;The Fabelmans&quot; (2022).

==Early life and education==
Hirsch was born in the Bronx, New York, to Sally (née Kitzis) (1903–1999) and Joseph Sidney Hirsch (1904–1989), an electrician. Joseph was born in New York, to a German Jewish father, Benjamin Hirsch, and an English-born mother, Rosa Hirsch Benjamin, whose family were Dutch Jews. Sally Hirsch was born in Russia, also to a Jewish family. Judd Hirsch has a brother named Roland.

He grew up in both Brooklyn and the Bronx and graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School (in the Bronx) in 1952. He earned a degree in physics from City College of New York.

After graduating from college, Hirsch served in the United States Army Reserve in 1958 at Fort Leonard Wood for six months as a surveyor. Next Hirsch worked as an engineer for Westinghouse before he found work in the theater. He studied acting at HB Studio in New York City. He graduated in 1962 from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City.
==Career==
The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; noted that Hirsch is &quot;one of the very few actors who slips effortlessly from TV series to Broadway to feature films and back again, racking up awards and favorable reviews wherever he performs.&quot;

===Film===
Hirsch received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in &quot;Ordinary People&quot; (1980), which won the Academy Award for Best Picture that year. His other film performances from the decade include leading roles in the 1983 drama &quot;Without a Trace&quot;, the 1984 dramedies, &quot;Teachers&quot; and &quot;The Goodbye People&quot;, and the 1988 drama &quot;Running on Empty&quot;, directed by Sidney Lumet and co-starring River Phoenix. In 1996, Hirsch portrayed the father of Jeff Goldblum&#x27;s character in the blockbuster &quot;Independence Day&quot;, a role that he later reprised in its 2016 sequel. In 2001, he played a Princeton University professor in the Academy Award-winning film &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;. Hirsch has more recently had supporting roles in acclaimed films such as &quot;The Meyerowitz Stories&quot; (2017) and &quot;Uncut Gems&quot; (2019).

In 2023, at the age of 87, Hirsch became the second-oldest acting nominee for an Academy Award after being nominated for his role in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s film &quot;The Fabelmans&quot; (2022). He also broke the record for the longest gap between Oscar nominations.

===Television===
After appearing frequently on television in the 1970s, including one season (1976–1977) in the series &quot;Delvecchio&quot;, Hirsch gained stardom for his lead role of Alex Rieger in the popular sitcom &quot;Taxi&quot;, which ran from 1978 to 1983. For his performance in the series, Hirsch won the Emmy Award for Lead Actor In a Comedy Series in 1981 and 1983. In 1999, he reprised his role from &quot;Taxi&quot; for a brief moment in &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;, the biopic of his co-star from &quot;Taxi&quot;, Andy Kaufman (portrayed by Jim Carrey).

After &quot;Taxi&quot;, Hirsch played the title character on the modestly successful sitcom &quot;Dear John&quot; and in 1989 won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Television Series in a Comedy or Musical for this role. He later teamed up with Bob Newhart in the short-lived comedy &quot;George and Leo&quot;.

Hirsch co-starred on the CBS Television drama &quot;Numb3rs&quot; (2005–2010) as Alan Eppes, father of FBI agent Don Eppes (Rob Morrow), and Professor Charlie Eppes (David Krumholtz). 

Hirsch has guest-starred on episodes of &quot;Warehouse 13&quot;, &quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, &quot;God Friended Me&quot;, and &quot;The Whole Truth&quot; (he reunited with &quot;Numb3rs&quot; co-star Rob Morrow), among others and lent his voice to the animated programs &quot;Tom Goes to the Mayor&quot; and &quot;American Dad!&quot; Hirsch has also appeared several times on the television show &quot;Maron&quot; as comedian Marc Maron&#x27;s father; he has had a recurring role on &quot;The Goldbergs&quot;, playing the father of Jeff Garlin&#x27;s character. In 2016, Hirsch appeared on the CBS comedy series &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; portraying the father of Johnny Galecki&#x27;s character, Leonard.

From 2014 to 2015, Hirsch appeared as a series regular on the ABC television series &quot;Forever&quot;. From 2017 to 2018, Hirsch starred in the short-lived CBS comedy &quot;Superior Donuts&quot; which lasted two seasons.

In early 2020, Hirsch appeared in a scene as the historic Simon Wiesenthal, in season 1, episode 8 of the Amazon Prime Video show &quot;Hunters&quot;, which stars Al Pacino.

===Theatre===
Hirsch won the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play for his work in &quot;Conversations with My Father,&quot; a Herb Gardner play. Other noteworthy stage performances include &quot;The Hot l Baltimore,&quot; &quot;Talley&#x27;s Folly,&quot; and his starring role in &quot;I&#x27;m Not Rappaport,&quot; for which Hirsch also won a Tony Award in 1986.

==Personal life==
Hirsch was married to his first wife, Elisa Sadaune, from 1963 to 1967. Their son, Alex Hirsch, was born in 1966. Hirsch married Bonni Sue Chalkin, a fashion designer, in 1992 and the couple divorced in 2005. From this second marriage, Hirsch has a daughter, Montana, and a son, London.

<text>Artur Axmann (18 February 1913 – 24 October 1996) was the German Nazi national leader (&quot;Reichsjugendführer&quot;) of the Hitler Youth (&quot;Hitlerjugend&quot;) from 1940 to 1945, when the war ended. He was the last living Nazi with a rank equivalent to &quot;Reichsleiter&quot;.

== Early life and career ==
Axmann was born in Hagen, Westphalia, the son of an insurance clerk. In 1916, his family moved to Berlin-Wedding, where his father died two years later. The young Axmann was a good student and received a scholarship to attend secondary school. He joined the Hitler Youth in November 1928 after he had heard Nazi &quot;Gauleiter&quot; Joseph Goebbels speak. Axmann became leader of the local cell in the Wedding district.

== Nazi career ==

In September 1931, Axmann joined the Nazi Party and the next year he was called to the NSDAP &quot;Reichsjugendführung&quot; to carry out a reorganisation of Hitler Youth factory and vocational school cells. After the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, he rose to a regional leader and became Chief of the Social Office of the Reich Youth Leadership.

Axmann directed the Hitler Youth in state vocational training and succeeded in raising the status of Hitler Youth agricultural work. He was also a member of Hans Frank&#x27;s Academy for German Law and the chairman of its Committee on Youth Law. In November 1934, he was appointed Hitler Youth leader of Berlin and from 1936, presided at the annual &quot;Reichsberufswettkampf&quot; competitions. On 30 January 1939 he was awarded the Golden Party Badge. On 1 May 1940, he was appointed deputy to Nazi &quot;Reichsjugendführer&quot; Baldur von Schirach, whom he succeeded three months later on 8 August 1940. In October 1941, Axmann became a member of the &quot;Reichstag&quot; from electoral constituency 1, East Prussia.

After World War II began in Europe, Axmann was on active service on the Western Front until May 1940. As a member of the Wehrmacht 23rd Infantry Division, he was severely wounded on the Eastern Front in 1941 and lost his right arm.

In early 1943, Axmann proposed the formation of the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend to Heinrich Himmler, with servicemen drawn from the Hitler Youth. Hitler approved the plan for the combat division to be made up of Hitler Youth members born in 1926, and recruitment and training began. In the last weeks of the war in Europe, Axmann commanded units of the Hitler Youth, which had been incorporated into the Home Guard (&quot;Volkssturm&quot;). His units consisted mostly of children and adolescents and fought in the Battle of Seelow Heights and the Battle in Berlin.

=== Berlin, 1945 ===
During Hitler&#x27;s last days in Berlin, Axmann was among those present in the &quot;Führerbunker&quot;. Meanwhile, it was announced in the German press that Axmann had been awarded the German Order, the highest decoration that the Nazi Party could bestow on an individual for his services to the Reich. He and one other recipient, Konstantin Hierl, were the only holders of the award to survive the war and its consequences. All other recipients were either awarded it posthumously or were killed during the war or its aftermath.

On 30 April 1945, just a few hours before committing suicide, Hitler signed the order to allow a breakout. According to a report made to his Soviet captors by &quot;Gruppenführer&quot; Hans Rattenhuber, the head of Hitler&#x27;s RSD bodyguard, Axmann took the Walther PP pistol that had been removed from Hitler&#x27;s sitting room in the &quot;Führerbunker&quot; by Heinz Linge, Hitler&#x27;s valet, which Hitler had used to commit suicide and said that he would &quot;hide it for better times&quot;.

On 1 May, Axmann left the &quot;Führerbunker&quot; as part of a breakout group, which included Martin Bormann, Werner Naumann and SS doctor Ludwig Stumpfegger. The group managed to cross the River Spree at the Weidendammer Bridge.

Leaving the rest of their group, Bormann, Stumpfegger, and Axmann walked along railway tracks to Lehrter railway station. Bormann and Stumpfegger followed the railway tracks towards Stettiner station. Axmann decided to go in the opposite direction of his two companions. When he encountered a Red Army patrol, Axmann doubled back. He saw two bodies, which he later identified as Bormann and Stumpfegger, on the Invalidenstraße bridge near the railway switching yard (Lehrter Bahnhof), the moonlight clearly illuminating their faces. He did not have time to check the bodies thoroughly and so he did not know how they died. His statements were confirmed by the discovery of Bormann&#x27;s and Stumpfegger&#x27;s remains in 1972.

== Post-war ==

Axmann avoided capture by Soviet troops and lived under the alias of &quot;Erich Siewert&quot; for several months. In December 1945, Axmann was arrested in Lübeck when a Nazi underground movement, which he had been organising, was uncovered by a United States Army counterintelligence operation.

Axmann uniquely saw blood dripping from both of Hitler&#x27;s temples; he told US officials that he interpreted this as secondary damage from a gunshot through the mouth, due to the mouth hanging loosely. Axmann stood by this interpretation in his 1955 testimony, but court experts pointed out that the relevant caliber, 7.65 mm, travels under the velocity able to produce such a hydrodynamic expulsion. The two other key witnesses to survive the war were Linge and Günsche. Linge recalled only one temple wound–usually as being on Hitler&#x27;s right side. Günsche reportedly told the Soviets that he did not see the wound himself, but in his 1956 testimony and later interviews stated that he also saw an entry wound to the right temple. In 1995, German historian Anton Joachimsthaler theorized that after Hitler shot himself, the bullet passed through one temple and became lodged inside the other, rupturing in a hematoma that looked like the exit wound described by &quot;several witnesses&quot;, although Axmann&#x27;s version is evidently singular. Joachimsthaler cites a 1925 German study concluding that, based upon 47 cases of gunshots to living bodies, it is not uncommon for a bullet to become lodged or shatter within; he does not mention that the two shots fired through the temples at contact range both resulted in an exit.

Axmann asserted that Hitler&#x27;s corpse was never identified because the gunshot destroyed his dental work. Similarly, Harry Mengershausen claimed that Hitler&#x27;s jawbones would have been broken due to the gunshot&#x27;s effect on air pressure. For the first two decades after the war, Western historians generally regarded Hitler&#x27;s mandible as being wholly recovered by the Soviets, as opposed to only a fragment with teeth. These dental remains were novelly detailed in a 1968 Soviet book which in turn supported the Western conclusion that only the dental remains of Hitler and Eva Braun were found intact.

In May 1949, a Nuremberg denazification court sentenced Axmann to a prison sentence of three years and three months as a &quot;major offender&quot;. He was not found guilty of war crimes.

On 19 August 1958, a West Berlin court fined the former Hitler Youth leader 35,000 marks (approximately £3,000 or US$8,300, ), about half the value of his property in Berlin. The court found him guilty of indoctrinating German youth with National Socialism until the end of the war in Europe but concluded that he was not guilty of war crimes.

After his release from custody, Axmann worked as a businessman with varying success. From 1971 he left Germany for a number of years and lived on the Spanish island of Gran Canaria. Axmann returned to Berlin in 1976, where he died on 24 October 1996, aged 83. His cause of death and details of his surviving family members were not disclosed.

<doc id="414113" wikidata="Q190214" url="?curid=414113" title="The Lord of the Rings (film series)">
<text>The Lord of the Rings is a trilogy of epic fantasy adventure films directed by Peter Jackson, based on the novel &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; by English author J. R. R. Tolkien. The films are titled identically to the three volumes of the novel: &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; (2001), &quot;The Two Towers&quot; (2002), and &quot;The Return of the King&quot; (2003). Produced and distributed by New Line Cinema with the co-production of Jackson&#x27;s WingNut Films, the films feature an ensemble cast including Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Liv Tyler, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Cate Blanchett, John Rhys-Davies, Christopher Lee, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Orlando Bloom, Hugo Weaving, Andy Serkis, and Sean Bean.

Set in the fictional world of Middle-earth, the films follow the hobbit Frodo Baggins as he and the Company of the Ring embark on a quest to destroy the One Ring to defeat its maker, the Dark Lord Sauron. The Company eventually splits up and Frodo continues the quest with his loyal companion Sam and, eventually, the treacherous Gollum. Meanwhile, Aragorn, heir in exile to the throne of Gondor, along with the elf Legolas, the dwarf Gimli, Merry, Pippin, Boromir, and the wizard Gandalf, unite to save the Free Peoples of Middle-earth from the forces of Sauron and rally them in the War of the Ring to aid Frodo by distracting Sauron&#x27;s attention.

The three films were shot simultaneously in Jackson&#x27;s native New Zealand from 11 October 1999 until 22 December 2000, with pick-up shots from 2001 to 2003. It was one of the biggest and most ambitious film projects ever undertaken, with a budget of $281 million (equivalent to $ million in ). The first film in the series premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on 10 December 2001; the second film premiered at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City on 5 December 2002; the third film premiered at the Embassy Theatre in Wellington on 1 December 2003. An extended edition of each film was released on home video a year after its release in cinemas.

&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential film series ever made. It was a major financial success and is among the highest-grossing film series of all time, having grossed over $2.9 billion worldwide. Their faithfulness to the source material was a subject of discussion. The series received numerous accolades, winning 17 Academy Awards out of 30 total nominations, including Best Picture for &quot;The Return of the King&quot;. In 2021, the Library of Congress selected &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

=== Casting ===

Jackson began abstract discussions on casting during the development of the scripts with Miramax. Jackson, Walsh, and Boyens compiled a casting wishlist, which included Cate Blanchett for Galadriel and Ian Holm for Bilbo. Wondering whether Patrick Stewart would be right for the part of Gandalf, Philippa Boyens drew a tape of him performing opposite Ian McKellen, only to suggest the latter to Jackson. McKellen became Jackson&#x27;s first choice for Gandalf. Christopher Lee sent Jackson a photograph of himself in a wizard&#x27;s costume, wanting to play Gandalf, but Jackson decided Lee would instead be better as Saruman.

Miramax wanted a recognisable name for Gandalf and suggested Max von Sydow or Paul Scofield and, wanting an American star, even mentioned Morgan Freeman. When New Line took over, they suggested Christopher Plummer or Sean Connery for the part (both declined). When von Sydow inquired for the part later, his agent told him they were looking for an English actor.

While casting, Jackson looked for backup options for the various parts, including Lucy Lawless and Nicole Kidman for Galadriel; Anthony Hopkins or Sylvester McCoy (eventually cast as Radagast in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; trilogy) for Bilbo; Paul Scofield, Jeremy Irons, Malcolm McDowell, or Tim Curry for Saruman. For Gandalf, they looked into Tom Baker, Tom Wilkinson, Sam Neill, Bernard Hill (who was instead cast as Théoden), and Peter O&#x27;Toole, and into several older actors who auditioned for other parts, such as Patrick McGoohan and Anthony Hopkins.

Miramax and Jackson discussed Daniel Day-Lewis for Aragorn, starting &quot;fanciful internet speculation&quot; that Day-Lewis was approached for the part numerous times, although Jackson eventually inquired about him. Jackson cast Stuart Townsend, whom the studio deemed too young. After shooting began, Jackson agreed and decided to recast the role. They approached Viggo Mortensen, but also spoke to Russell Crowe (who auditioned for Boromir previously), as a backup choice.

Patrick McGoohan, their first choice for Denethor, proved &quot;quite grumpy&quot; when they met, and they instead looked into Donald Sutherland and John Rhys-Davies, and ultimately cast John Noble. Davies was recast as Gimli, instead of Billy Connolly (later cast as Dáin in &quot;The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies&quot;), Robert Trebor, and Timothy Spall. In conversations with Miramax, Liam Neeson&#x27;s name came up for Boromir, but he declined. New Line suggested Nicolas Cage, but the filmmakers declined and cast Sean Bean.

== Development ==

=== Previous attempts ===

Previous attempts to film J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s works were made by William Snyder, Peter Shaffer and John Boorman. These attempts resulted in a couple of unproduced scripts, concept art and an animated short. Other filmmakers and producers to have had an interest in adapting Tolkien are said to include Walt Disney, Al Brodax, Forrest Ackerman, Denis O&#x27;Dell (who considered Richard Lester to direct, but instead approached David Lean, Stanley Kubrick, and Michelangelo Antonioni) and George Lucas. The rights to adapt Tolkien&#x27;s works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to Rembrandt Films before being sold perpetually to United Artists. In 1976, UA passed the rights to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (and a part of those to &quot;The Hobbit&quot;) to Fantasy Films.

In 1977, an animated adaptation of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was produced as a TV special by Rankin and Bass and in 1978 Ralph Bakshi made an animated feature of the first half of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. While profitable, the film did not make enough money to automatically warrant the sequel which would close the story and an argument with producer Saul Zaentz led Bakshi to abandon the project. Rankin/Bass then followed in 1980 with an animated TV adaptation of &quot;The Return of the King&quot;. Several other Tolkienesque fantasy films were produced at the time, including Jim Henson and Frank Oz&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; and Lucas&#x27;s &quot;Willow&quot;.

At the time of the release of Bakshi&#x27;s film, a teenaged Peter Jackson had not read the book, but &quot;heard the name&quot;, and went to see the film: &quot;I liked the early part—it had some quaint sequences in Hobbiton, a creepy encounter with the Black Rider on the road, and a few quite good battle scenes—but then, about half way through, the storytelling became very disjointed and disorientating and I really didn&#x27;t understand what was going on. However, what it did do was to make me want to read the book—if only to find out what happened!&quot; Jackson bought a tie-in paperback edition. He later read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; and listened to the 1981 BBC radio adaptation. Assuming someone would one day adapt it to a live-action film, Jackson read up on some previous attempts to bring the piece to the screen. He had not watched the Rankin and Bass TV specials.

=== Pitch to Miramax ===

In 1995, while completing post-production on &quot;The Frighteners&quot;, Jackson and Fran Walsh discussed making an original fantasy film, but could not think of a scenario that was not Tolkien-esque, and eventually decided to look up the film rights. They went to Harvey Weinstein from Miramax, who got the rights from Saul Zaentz. Jackson knew it would take multiple films to do Tolkien justice, but initially pitched a single trilogy: one film based on &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and, if that would prove successful, two &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; films shot back-to-back. Jackson began rereading &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, looking at illustrations and commissioning concept art from the book, but the rights eventually proved unattainable, having been split between Zaentz and United Artists. Weinstein tried to buy the studio&#x27;s share of the rights, but was unsuccessful.

With &quot;The Hobbit&quot; postponed for a later prequel, Jackson proceeded with making two or more &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; films: &quot;We pitched the idea of three films and Miramax didn&#x27;t really want to take that risk, but we agreed on two.&quot; He began writing the scripts with Walsh and Stephen Sinclair, storyboarding with Christian Rivers, and discussing casting ideas with the Weinsteins.

=== Move to New Line ===

As the scripts took shape, it became clear that the budget required would exceed Miramax&#x27;s capabilities. The Weinsteins suggested cutting the project to one film. Jackson inquired whether it could be around four hours in duration, but Miramax insisted on two hours, suggesting major cuts to the story, which Jackson refused. Harvey Weinstein threatened to replace Jackson with screenwriter Hossein Amini and directors John Madden or Quentin Tarantino. Jackson believed this was an empty threat to get him to concede to making a one-film version himself.

Harvey Weinstein eventually relented and agreed to put the project into turnaround, but his onerous conditions were meant to prevent the project from being taken up by another studio. Jackson got an audience with New Line CEO Robert Shaye, who accepted the project, but requested that it be expanded into a trilogy. New Line had many promising reasons that the trilogy would be successful, which led them to sign on. Final cut rights were shared contractually between Jackson and Bob Shaye, but there was never any interference in Jackson&#x27;s cut. Initially, each film had a production budget of $60 million, but New Line accepted Jackson&#x27;s request for an increased budget after a 26-minute preview of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; was presented at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival.

== Production ==

Jackson began storyboarding and screenwriting the series with Christian Rivers, Fran Walsh, and Philippa Boyens in 1997 and assigned his crew to begin designing Middle-earth at the same time. Jackson, Walsh, and Boyens did not write each film to correspond exactly to its respective book, opting instead to write a three-part adaptation with some sequences missing, some sequences created from scratch, and some sequences moved from one area to another, regardless of its placement in the books. To allow the story to be clearer for viewers, Jackson took a more chronological approach to the story than Tolkien&#x27;s complex interlacing of storylines. During shooting, the screenplays continued to evolve, in part due to contributions from cast members looking to further explore their characters.

Earlier versions of the script included additional characters like Fatty Bolger, Glorfindel, Elladan, Elrohir, Erkenbrand, Imrahil, and Forlong. At one point, Jackson even considered reintroducing Tom Bombadil in a cameo. Gimli was going to swear throughout the films and Arwen would join the Fellowship in Rohan and share a nude scene with Aragorn in the pools of the Glittering Caves.

Jackson hired long-time collaborator Richard Taylor to lead Weta Workshop on five major design elements: armour, weapons, prosthetic makeup, creatures, and miniatures. At New Line&#x27;s request, animation supervisor Jim Rygiel replaced Weta Digital&#x27;s Mark Stetson. In November 1997, famed Tolkien illustrators Alan Lee and John Howe joined the project; but Jackson also relied on the work of Ted Nasmith, who later turned down an offer to join Alan and John. Jackson wanted realistic designs in the style of historical epics rather than fantasy films, citing &quot;Braveheart&quot; as an inspiration:

Production designer Grant Major was charged with converting Lee and Howe&#x27;s designs into architecture, creating models of the sets, while Dan Hennah worked as art director, scouting locations and organizing the building of sets. Ngila Dickson collaborated with Richard Taylor on producing costumes, while Peter King and Peter Owen designed makeup and hair. Most of these crew members (and others) returned to work on &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.

Jackson and cinematographer Andrew Lesnie considered shooting in large format like 65 mm film, or to master the films at 4K, but both were cost-prohibitive and could not be done on New Zealand soil. They decided to shoot on fine-grain Super 35 mm film and subject the films to rigorous digital grading.

Principal photography for all three films was conducted concurrently in many locations within New Zealand&#x27;s conservation areas and national parks. Filming took place between 11 October 1999 and 22 December 2000. Pick-up shoots were conducted annually from 2001 to 2004. The series was shot at many different locations, with seven different units shooting, and soundstages around Wellington and Queenstown. Along with Jackson directing the whole production, other unit directors included John Mahaffie, Geoff Murphy, Barrie M. Osborne, Rick Porras, George Marshall Ruge, and any other assistant director, producer, or writer available. Miniature Photography took place throughout the entire period, amounting to over 1,000 shooting days.

Weta Digital developed new technologies to allow for the groundbreaking digital effects required for the trilogy, including the development of the MASSIVE software to generate intelligent crowds for battle scenes, and advancing the art of motion capture, which was used on bipedal creatures like the Cave Troll or Gollum. With Jackson&#x27;s future films, motion-capture technology came to be pushed so far that it became referred to as &quot;digital makeup&quot;, although it was later clarified that during &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; period, it was still fairly reliant on the CG animators.

Each film had the benefit of a full year of post-production time before its respective December release, often finishing in October–November, with the crew immediately going to work on the next film. Jackson originally wanted to edit all three films with Jamie Selkirk, but this proved too much work. The next idea was to have John Gilbert, Michael Horton, and Selkirk, respectively, editing the three films simultaneously, but after a month that proved too difficult for Jackson, and the films were edited in consecutive years, although Selkirk continued to act as &quot;Supervising Editor&quot; on the first two entries. Daily rushes would often last up to four hours, and by the time &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; had been released, assembly cuts of the other two films (4 hours each) were already prepared. In total, 1,828 km (six million feet) of film was edited down to the 11 hours and 26 minutes (686 minutes) of extended running time.

== Music ==

Howard Shore composed, orchestrated, conducted and produced the trilogy&#x27;s music. Shore visited the set in 1999, and composed a version of the Shire theme and Frodo&#x27;s Theme before Jackson began shooting. In August 2000, he visited the set again and watched the assembly cuts of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and &quot;The Return of the King&quot;. In the music, Shore included many (85 to 110) leitmotifs to represent various characters, cultures and places—the largest catalogue of leitmotifs in the history of cinema, surpassing, for comparison, that of the entire &quot;Star Wars&quot; film series. For example, there are multiple leitmotifs just for the hobbits and the Shire. Although the first film had some of its score recorded in Wellington, virtually all of the trilogy&#x27;s score was recorded in Watford Town Hall and mixed at Abbey Road Studios. Jackson planned to advise the score for six weeks each year in London, though for &quot;The Two Towers&quot; he stayed for twelve.

The score is primarily played by the London Philharmonic Orchestra, ranging from 93 to 120 players throughout the recording. London Voices, the London Oratory School Schola boy choir, and many artists such as Ben Del Maestro, Sheila Chandra, Enya, Renée Fleming, James Galway, Annie Lennox, and Emilíana Torrini contributed. Even actors Billy Boyd, Viggo Mortensen, Liv Tyler, Miranda Otto (extended cuts only for the latter two), and Peter Jackson (for a single gong sound in the second film) contributed to the score. Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens served as librettists, writing lyrics to various music and songs, which David Salo translated into Tolkien&#x27;s languages. The third film&#x27;s end song, &quot;Into the West&quot;, was a tribute to a young filmmaker Jackson and Walsh befriended named Cameron Duncan, who died of cancer in 2003.

Shore composed a main theme for the Fellowship rather than many different character themes, and its strength and weaknesses in volume are depicted at different points in the series. On top of that, individual themes were composed to represent different cultures. Infamously, the amount of music Shore had to write every day for the third film increased dramatically to around seven minutes. The music for the series has been voted best movie soundtrack of all time for the six years running, passing &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; (1993), &quot;Gladiator&quot; (2000), &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977), and &quot;Out of Africa&quot; (1985), respectively.

=== Soundtracks ===


== Reception ==

=== Box office ===
The trilogy&#x27;s online promotional trailer was first released on 27 April 2000 and set a new record for download hits, registering 1.7 million hits in the first 24 hours of its release. The trailer used a selection from the soundtrack for &quot;Braveheart&quot; and &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; among other cuts. In 2001, 24 minutes of footage from the series, primarily the Moria sequence, was shown at the 54th Cannes Film Festival, and was very well received. The showing also included an area designed to look like Middle-earth.

&quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; was released on 19 December 2001. It grossed $47.2 million in its U.S. opening weekend and made over $868 million worldwide. A preview of &quot;The Two Towers&quot; was inserted just before the end credits near the end of the film&#x27;s theatrical run. A promotional trailer was later released, containing music re-scored from the film &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot;. &quot;The Two Towers&quot; was released 18 December 2002. It grossed $62 million in its first U.S. weekend and out-grossed its predecessor with over $923 million worldwide. The promotional trailer for &quot;The Return of the King&quot; was debuted exclusively before the New Line Cinema film &quot;Secondhand Lions&quot; on 23 September 2003. Released 17 December 2003, its first U.S. weekend gross was $72.6 million, and became the second film, after &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997), to gross over $1.1 billion worldwide.
The films are the highest-grossing in New Zealand cinema history, and the second-highest grossing franchise filmed in New Zealand behind &quot;Avatar&quot;.

=== Critical and public response ===

&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy received widespread acclaim and is ranked among the greatest film trilogies ever made. Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that &quot;the trilogy will not soon, if ever, find its equal&quot;, while Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; described the films as &quot;one of the most ambitious and phenomenally successful dream projects of all time&quot;. &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; was voted the greatest fantasy movie of all time in a reader&#x27;s poll conducted by American magazine &quot;Wired&quot; in 2012, while &quot;The Two Towers&quot; and &quot;The Return of the King&quot; placed fourth and third respectively. &quot;The Independent&quot; ranked &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy at No. 2 on its list of &quot;10 greatest movie trilogies of all time&quot;. &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy is ranked at No. 2 in &quot;/Film&quot;″s list of &quot;The 15 Greatest Trilogies Of All Time&quot;, while &quot;Empire&quot; ranked it at No. 1 in its list of &quot;The 33 Greatest Movie Trilogies&quot;.

The series appears in the Dallas–Fort Worth Film Critics Association: Top 10 Films, &quot;Time&quot;″s All-Time 100 Movies, and James Berardinelli&#x27;s Top 100. In 2007, &quot;USA Today&quot; named the series as the most important films of the past 25 years. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; put it on its end-of-the-decade, &quot;best-of&quot; list, saying, &quot;Bringing a cherished book to the big screen? No sweat. Peter Jackson&#x27;s trilogy — or, as we like to call it, our preciousssss — exerted its irresistible pull, on advanced Elvish speakers and neophytes alike.&quot; &quot;Paste&quot; named it one of the 50 Best Movies of the Decade (2000–2009), ranking it at No. 4.
In another &quot;Time&quot; magazine list, the series ranks second in &quot;Best Movies of the Decade&quot;. In addition, six characters and their respective actors made the list of &#x27;The 100 Greatest Movie Characters&#x27;, also compiled by &quot;Empire&quot;, with Viggo Mortensen&#x27;s portrayal of Aragorn ranking No. 15, Ian McKellen&#x27;s portrayal of Gandalf ranking No. 30, Ian Holm&#x27;s portrayal of Bilbo Baggins (shared with Martin Freeman for his portrayal of the same character in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; films) ranking No. 61, Andy Serkis&#x27; portrayal of Gollum ranking No. 66, Sean Astin&#x27;s portrayal of Samwise Gamgee ranking No. 77, and Orlando Bloom&#x27;s portrayal of Legolas ranking No. 94.


=== Industry response ===

The series drew acclaim from within the industry, including from the film directors Steven Spielberg, James Cameron, and George Lucas. John Boorman, who once wrote a script for a &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; film, said he was happy his own version was unmade as Jackson&#x27;s film trilogy was &quot;of such scope and magnitude that it can only be compared to the building of the great Gothic cathedrals.&quot; Forrest J. Ackerman, who once presented a film treatment to Tolkien, and appeared on Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Bad Taste&quot; said his pitch &quot;could never have been given the grand treatment that Peter Jackson afforded it.&quot; Arthur Rankin said Jackson was making &quot;marvellous films.&quot;

However, some filmmakers were more critical. Heinz Edelmann, who pitched the idea of an animated feature when United Artists considered shooting the films with the Beatles, thought it was &quot;badly directed.&quot; Ralph Bakshi, who made an animated film based on the first half of the trilogy, didn&#x27;t watch the films, but was told that Jackson&#x27;s film was derivative of his. Ahead of the films&#x27; release, he said he did not &quot;understand it&quot; but that he does &quot;wish it to be a good movie.&quot; Later, he begruged Saul Zaentz for not notifying him of the live-action film, and said that Jackson had his film to study and therefore had &quot;a little easier time than I did.&quot; Afterwards, he grumbled that Jackson &quot;didn&#x27;t understand&quot; Tolkien and created &quot;special effects garbage&quot; to sell toys, as well as being derivative of his own film. Bakshi further blamed Jackson for not acknowledging the influence that the animated film had on him, saying (falsely) that he denied having seen Bakshi&#x27;s film at all until being forced to mention him, at which point (according to Bakshi) he mentioned Bakshi&#x27;s influence &quot;only once&quot; as &quot;PR bolony.&quot; However, he did praise Jackson&#x27;s special effects and, in 2015, even apologised for some of his remarks. Bakshi&#x27;s animator Mike Ploog and writer Peter Beagle both praised the live-action film.

=== Accolades ===

The three films together were nominated for a total of 30 Academy Awards, of which they won 17, both records for any movie trilogy. &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; earned 13 nominations, the most of any film at the 74th Academy Awards, winning four; &quot;The Two Towers&quot; won two awards from six nominations at the 75th Academy Awards; &quot;The Return of the King&quot; won in every category in which it was nominated at the 76th Academy Awards, setting the current Oscar record for the highest clean sweep, and its 11 Academy Awards wins ties the record held by &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1959) and &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997). &quot;The Return of the King&quot; also became only the second sequel to win the Oscar for Best Picture after &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; (1974).

Additionally, members of the production crew won the Academy Award for Technical Achievement for the rendering of skin textures on creatures on &quot;The Return of the King&quot;, and Stephen Regelous won the Academy Award for Scientific and Engineering Award for the design and development of MASSIVE, &quot;the autonomous agent animation system used for the battle sequences in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy.&quot;


Each film in the series won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, the MTV Movie Award for Movie of the Year, and the Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film. The first and third films also won the BAFTA Award for Best Film. The New York Film Critics Circle awarded &quot;The Return of the King&quot; its Best Picture Award at the 2003 Awards Ceremony, hosted by Andrew Johnston, chair of the organisation at that time, who called it &quot;a masterful piece of filmmaking.&quot;

=== Comparisons with the written work ===

Commentators have compared Jackson&#x27;s film trilogy with Tolkien&#x27;s written work, remarking that while both have been extremely successful commercially, they differ in many respects. Critics have admired Jackson&#x27;s ability to film the long and complex work at all; the beauty of the cinematography, sets, and costumes; and the epic scale of his version of Tolkien&#x27;s story. They have however found the characters and the story greatly weakened by Jackson&#x27;s emphasis on action and violence at the expense of psychological depth; the loss of Tolkien&#x27;s emphasis on free will and individual responsibility; and the replacement of Frodo&#x27;s inner journey by an American monomyth with Aragorn as the hero.

As for whether the film trilogy is faithful to the novel, opinions range from Verlyn Flieger&#x27;s feeling that a film adaptation is not even worth attempting, Wayne G. Hammond&#x27;s opinion that the film sacrifices the book&#x27;s richness of characterization and narrative for violence, thrills, and cheap humour, or Christopher Tolkien&#x27;s view that Jackson&#x27;s interpretation is unacceptable, to granting, with Jackson and Boyens, that the film version is inevitably different. From that standpoint, scholars such as Brian Rosebury and Tom Shippey have described the films as a partial success, giving some of the feeling and capturing some of the key themes of the novel. Yvette Kisor considers that Jackson was unfaithful to many of Tolkien&#x27;s details, but succeeded in achieving something of the same impact and feelings of providence, eucatastrophe, and interconnectedness. Dimitra Fimi suggests that Jackson was continuing Tolkien&#x27;s tradition of adapting folklore, incorporating both the fans&#x27; views on that folklore, and cinematic traditions such as the zombie in the film trilogy to produce its own modern folklore.

== Home media ==

The first two films were released on two-disc standard edition DVDs containing previews of the following film. The success of the theatrical cuts brought about four-disc extended editions, with new editing, added special effects and music. Jackson came up with the idea of an extended cut for LaserDisc and DVD formats while in preproduction. He could insert some of the violence that he thought he would have to trim to get a PG-13 rating for the theatre and he could tailor the pacing to the demands of the small screen, which he said were &quot;completely different&quot;. Jackson has stated that he considers the theatrical cuts to be the &quot;definitive versions&quot; of the films due to their deliberate pacing but also that he believes the extended cuts will be &quot;ultimately seen as the more definitive versions of the films&quot;.

The extended cuts of the films and the supplemental special features (dubbed &quot;appendices&quot;) were spread over two discs each in a four-disc box set for each film. A limited collector&#x27;s edition was also released featuring sculpted bookends. &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; was released on 12 November 2002, containing 30 minutes of extra footage. &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, released on 18 November 2003, contains 44 minutes of extra footage. &quot;The Return of the King&quot; was released on 14 December 2004, with 51 minutes more footage. The extended cuts have also played at cinemas, most notably the first two for a 16 December 2003 marathon screening (dubbed &quot;Trilogy Tuesday&quot;) culminating in a screening of the third film. In 2006, both versions of each film were released together in a limited edition, which includes a new feature-length documentary for each film (but not the extras from the previous releases).

Warner Bros. released a box set of the trilogy&#x27;s theatrical versions on Blu-ray on 6 April 2010. The four-disc extended sets were released on Blu-ray in a box set on 28 June 2011, with an additional disc including the feature-length documentary. In 2014, Blu-ray steelbook editions of the five-disc extended editions were released. In 2016, a six-disc Blu-ray was released containing only the theatrical films of both &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit&quot; trilogies, as well as a 30-disc bookshelf-themed set of the extended versions of both trilogies and all the special features from previous releases. The Blu-ray releases were criticised for colour-timing issues which degraded the look of the films.

In 2020, both trilogies were released on Ultra HD Blu-ray, featuring both the theatrical and extended versions. All six films were remastered to give them a more consistent colour treatment. Jackson explained that visual effects shots were improved for this release by and [painting] out any imperfections,&quot; but that they had not been or An audio remastering was made as well, with the films receiving a new Dolby Atmos mix. A 31-disc collector&#x27;s set including both versions of all six films in 4K and Blu-ray formats, was released in 2021 for the 20-year anniversary of the first film; this, however, does not include the appendices.

By 2017, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; films had a home-media revenue of more than $2.4 billion.

== Legacy ==

The release of the films saw a surge of interest in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and Tolkien&#x27;s other works, vastly increasing his impact on popular culture. The success of the films spawned numerous video games and many other kinds of merchandise.

=== Further films ===

==== &quot;The Hobbit&quot; trilogy ====

From 2012 to 2014 Peter Jackson and his studio Wingnut Films made &quot;The Hobbit&quot; trilogy consisting of the films &quot;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey&quot;, &quot;The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies&quot;. The trilogy works as a prequel to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; films. Though critics generally considered the trilogy to be inferior to the original films, it was still a financial success.

==== Spin-offs ====
In 2024, an anime prequel film titled &quot;The War of the Rohirrim&quot; was released. It is directed by Kenji Kamiyama, with Miranda Otto reprising her role from live-action, serving as the film&#x27;s narrator. Additionally, two new live-action films are in development with Jackson returning as producer. The first of these, &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum&quot;, will be directed by Andy Serkis for a planned release in 2026.

=== Reunion ===

In 2020, the actor Josh Gad aired a virtual cast reunion as the fourth episode of the web series &quot;Reunited Apart&quot;, a charity fundraising effort during the COVID-19 pandemic, supporting Share Our Strength&#x27;s campaign called &quot;No Kid Hungry&quot;. Many actors from the original cast participated, along with Jackson, Boyens, and Shore. The charity raised over $100,000.

=== Effects on the film industry and tourism ===
As a result of the series&#x27; success, Peter Jackson has become a major figure in the film industry in the mould of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, in the process befriending some industry heavyweights like Bryan Singer and Frank Darabont. Jackson has since founded his own film production company, Wingnut Films, as well as Wingnut Interactive, a video game company. He was also finally given a chance to remake &quot;King Kong&quot; in 2005. The film was a critical and box office success, although not as successful as &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; series. Jackson has been called a &quot;favourite son&quot; of New Zealand. In 2004, Howard Shore toured with &quot;The Lord of the Rings Symphony&quot;, playing two hours of the score. Along with the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films, the series has renewed interest in the fantasy film genre. Tourism in New Zealand is up, possibly due to its exposure in the series, with the country&#x27;s tourism industry waking up to an audience&#x27;s familiarity.

In 2002 the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa in Wellington created a travelling exhibition of the film trilogy, The Lord of the Rings Motion Picture Trilogy: The Exhibition. It visited cities around the world including Boston, London, Sydney, Singapore, and Houston.

=== Legal disputes ===

&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; left a legacy of court cases over profits from the trilogy. Sixteen cast members (Noel Appleby, Jed Brophy, Mark Ferguson, Ray Henwood, Bruce Hopkins, William Johnson, Nathaniel Lees, Sarah McLeod, Ian Mune, Paul Norell, Craig Parker, Robert Pollock, Martyn Sanderson, Peter Tait, and Stephen Ure) sued over the lack of revenue from merchandise bearing their appearance. The case was resolved out of court in 2008. The settlement came too late for Appleby, who died of cancer in 2007. Saul Zaentz also filed a lawsuit in 2004 claiming he had not been paid all of his royalties.

The next year, Jackson sued the studio over profits from the first film, slowing development of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; prequels until late 2007. The Tolkien Trust filed a lawsuit in February 2008, for violating Tolkien&#x27;s original deal over the rights that they would earn 7.5% of the gross from any films based on his works. The Trust sought compensation of $150 million. A judge denied them this option, but allowed them to win compensation from the act of the studio ignoring the contract itself. On 8 September 2009, the dispute was settled.

=== Video games ===

Numerous video games were released to supplement the film series. &quot;The Two Towers&quot; and &quot;The Return of the King&quot; are direct adaptations of the films. Other games include &quot;The Third Age&quot; and its Game Boy Advance version, &quot;Tactics&quot;, &quot;The Battle for Middle-earth&quot;, &quot;The Battle for Middle-earth II&quot; and its expansion &quot;The Rise of the Witch-king&quot;, &quot;Conquest&quot;, &quot;Aragorn&#x27;s Quest&quot;, &quot;War in the North&quot;, &quot;Lego The Lord of the Rings&quot;, &quot;Guardians of Middle-earth&quot;, &quot;Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor&quot;, and &quot;Middle-earth: Shadow of War&quot;.

<doc id="414118" wikidata="Q4826171" url="?curid=414118" title="Autobiography of a Brown Buffalo">
<text>Autobiography of a Brown Buffalo is the first novel by Oscar Zeta Acosta and it focuses on his own self-discovery in a fictionalized manner. An autobiography, the plot presents an alienated lawyer of Mexican descent, who works in an Oakland, California antipoverty agency, without any sense of purpose or identity.

==Plot summary==
The main character survives on drugs, alcohol, and counseling sessions until he becomes a Chicano activist. At the end of the work, the protagonist takes the middle name &quot;Zeta&quot;, a symbol that represents his Chicano and Mexican culture and roots. After traveling to his birthplace, the lost character discovers himself and learns lessons on the road as he reflects on his life.

On the back of some copies of the book, it says &quot;Oscar Zeta Acosta was famous as a Robin Hood Chicano lawyer and notorious as the real-life model for Hunter S. Thompson&#x27;s &#x27;Dr. Gonzo&#x27;&quot;, a character in the book and movie &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot;.

===Chapters 1–5===
The first five chapters take place on July 1, 1967; the narrative, however, is frequently broken up by flashbacks that explain the narrator’s relationship with various characters. The story begins in the morning as the narrator is preparing to go to work. Standing naked in front of the mirror, he reflects on his large brown body and his general health. He is both constipated and suffers from ulcers, which cause him to vomit. While looking in the mirror, he seeks advice from his “three favorite men”: Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney, and Edward G. Robinson. He also hears the voice of Dr. Serbin, his psychiatrist, who seems to be following him and who appears throughout the novel. The narrator masturbates in the shower while fantasizing about a friend&#x27;s wife.

The narrator leaves his apartment in San Francisco and drives to Oakland where he works as a legal aid lawyer. He has worked in the office since he passed the bar exam 12 months before. To get through the tedium of filing countless restraining orders for battered women and to deal with his inability to help the clients in a system that favors those with the money to pay high-priced lawyers, the narrator has spent the past year watching television, taking tranquilizers, and drinking.

When he arrives at work he avoids going into his office, unable to face the five women sitting in the waiting room. He assumes they have all been beaten by their husbands over the weekend. When he finally goes into his office, he learns that his secretary Pauline has died from cancer. Pauline has supported him in his job and has helped him negotiate the bureaucracy. The narrator did not know she was seriously ill. He decides that without Pauline&#x27;s support he cannot continue in the job.

He leaves the office and heads back to San Francisco. On the drive, he talks to himself and Dr. Serbin. He remembers the time three years before when he was sick for months with mononucleosis. During this time he met a neighbor in his apartment building, Cynthia, who was the sister of his friend Charlie Fisher. Cynthia introduced the narrator to marijuana and LSD. Through Cynthia, he also met a couple, Alice and Ted Casey, a sailor. While he was bedridden, Alice and Cynthia cared for the narrator by bringing him soup. Later he became friends with Ted and Alice, regularly visiting their apartment. The friendship ended when the narrator tested Ted&#x27;s liberal views on relationships by broaching the subject of his sleeping with Alice while Ted was away on one of his trips. Ted acted as though he was indifferent and that it was Alice&#x27;s decision but later, through a friend, threatened to cut off the narrator&#x27;s balls. This ended the friendship.

Returning to the central focus of the narrative, the narrator arrives at Ted Casey&#x27;s house and rings the bell. No one is home. He then goes to the office of his psychiatrist. Although the psychiatrist is meeting with a patient the narrator bangs on the door. When the psychiatrist opens the door, the narrator tells him he is leaving. The psychiatrist patiently asks him to wait, but the narrator leaves.

Having stopped off to pick up some scotch and now already drunk, the narrator goes to Trader JJ&#x27;s, a San Francisco bar he frequents. He has packed his belongings and plans to store them in the bar&#x27;s basement. Inside the bar, he talks with a mixed group of misfits who are his friends and form a community. They include Maria, a Jewish bisexual hustler, and Jose, a struggling homosexual artist. The patrons of the bar function by insulting each other. Maria teases the narrator about a former girlfriend, June MacAdoo. The two had dated for three months two years before. Shortly after June unexpectedly dumped the narrator, the narrator found out he failed the bar exam. He studied for three months and retook the exam. This time he passed. He was still heartbroken, however, and was no longer particularly interested in the law.

After leaving some of his belongings at the bar the narrator visits Maryjane and Bertha, two friends. He regards the women as friends, having found he could not sleep with them because of impotence brought on by his broken heart. At their apartment, the narrator finds not only the two women but Ted Casey. Ted is dressed in flashy clothes and is bossing the two, normally strong-willed, women, around. No longer a seaman, he has become a successful drug dealer. The narrator drinks most of a bottle of champagne that has been spiked with mescaline. The four drive-in Ted&#x27;s Cadillac to an expensive Italian restaurant to eat. At the restaurant, Ted shows off his wealth and his power. The group eats and snorts coke.

After dinner the four drive to Trader JJ&#x27;s. Maryjane and Ted leave the car but Bertha and the narrator stay behind. The narrator initiates a brief sexual encounter that ends when he quickly cums. Bertha is sympathetic. The two then join the others in the bar. In the bar, the narrator calls June, his ex-girlfriend. At first, she seems interested in seeing him but then tells him she is engaged. The narrator hangs up. More drinking and drunken revelry take place in the bar. The narrator eventually passes out, bringing an end to the day.

===Chapters 6–11===
This section of the story takes place over the course of three days as the narrator drives away from San Francisco. Taking drugs and drinking while he drives, the narrator&#x27;s thoughts focus on his childhood. He was born in El Paso but grew up from the age of five in Riverbank, a town of fewer than 4,000 people in California&#x27;s Central Valley. His parents were both Mexican: his father was an “Indio” from Durango and his mother was from a poor family in Juarez. Together they crossed the border illegally to El Paso. His father was drafted into the Navy during WWII and on his discharge was granted citizenship. The family lived in a two-room shack. The father imposed strict discipline and order based on the regulations of the Navy&#x27;s The Seabee Manual.

In the small town of Riverbank, the narrator and his only brother, Bob, were outsiders. As Mexicans, they were picked on by the Okies (folks from Oklahoma ), the poor whites. Other Mexicans also picked on the brothers because they were more recent immigrants. In addition to the Okies and the Mexicans, the third group in the town was the Americans, the relatively wealthy white families. Among the incidents from childhood, the narrator remembers is a childhood crush. Jane Addison was a new classmate and the daughter of the owner of the factory where the narrator&#x27;s mom worked. He scratched her initials on the back of his hand as a loving gesture. He was deeply hurt when he showed her the nearly illegible lines, she laughed. Later she told the teacher in front of the class that the narrator stunk.

After driving for two days, the narrator sees a beautiful blond hitchhiker. Karin Wilmington is a rich hippie, on her way from Mexico to Colorado. The narrator recounts his life story to Karin, although he says he is Samoan and that his name is Henry Hawk. This is one of several times in the story where the narrator assumes different identities, one of which is an Indian chief. The narrator and Karin find they have a friend in common, Turk, a crazy biker. The narrator splits up from Karin in Ketchum, Idaho but she leaves him a note inviting him to meet her at her brother&#x27;s house in nearby Wilmington. In Ketchum, the narrator visits Hemingway&#x27;s grave.

The narrator continues reflecting on his childhood. In high school, he played clarinet in the school band, was a starter on the variety football team, and was Class President. Yet he never studied and spent most of his time drinking with a group of four friends. The friends also went to a whore house regularly. For over a year the narrator never went with any of the girls. Finally, his friends tricked him into sleeping with Ruby, the very attractive Portuguese madam.

During his Junior year in high school, the narrator fell in love with a Freshman named Alice Brown. Although she walked with a slight limp caused by polio, she was incredibly beautiful and the narrator was instantly attracted to her. The two began seeing each other but when her parents found out about the relationship they made her write the narrator a note saying she could not see him anymore. Alice tells the narrator that her stepfather, a Baptist minister, threatened to divorce Alice&#x27;s mother if she allowed them to date. This was primarily because her stepfather hated Mexicans.

The narrator and Alice continued seeing each other discreetly. During his senior year, the narrator worked to have Alice crowned school queen. He was successful. At the winter dance where she was crowned, he danced with her; unfortunately, this led to her stepfather finding out about their relationship. When the narrator took her home from the dance the town sheriff was waiting at her house. He had brought the narrator&#x27;s parents as well. Pressure from the sheriff forces the narrator to agree not to see Alice. However, Alice and the narrator did continue to see each other at school. Occasionally the narrator would have one of his white friends pick up Alice so they could attend a school dance together.

After graduation the narrator, not knowing what else to do and having to wait for Alice to finish high school so they could marry, joined the Air Force. He played in the Air Force band and was stationed at nearby locations in California. For a while, the two continued to see each other whenever the narrator had to leave but eventually he received a Dear John letter from her. During this time, a friend convinced the narrator to convert from Catholicism to the Baptist faith. The narrator adopted the religion enthusiastically. He began leading prayer groups and he impressed members of the local congregation with his ability to testify to sin.

Shortly thereafter, he was transferred to a post in Panama. In his free time, which was considerable, he worked as a missionary to an Indian tribe in a rural village. Gradually, however, his faith waned. He went through the gospels and wrote out a list in favor and a list against what he read. The con list was far longer and the narrator gave up his belief. Afraid of confusing the Indians if he went back on his preaching, he continued giving them sermons on general themes such as brother lovely. After two years in Panama, the narrator was honorably discharged from the Air Force. He went to New Orleans where drank and smoke and briefly considered committing suicide but decided that jumping from a window would be too painful.

In Wilmington, the narrator attends a Fourth of July party at a mansion with the rich friends of Karen. The party features peyote-spiked guacamole. The peyote and the drinking cause the narrator&#x27;s ulcers to act up. He throws up and is comforted by Karin. She recommends that he continue what she calls “his search” by looking for Bobby Miller at the Daisy Duck bar in Alpine. The narrator says that what he really needs is a doctor to help him with his ulcers. The next day the narrator wakes up on Hemingway&#x27;s grave. He does not remember how he got there. The section ends with him behind the wheel of his car heading to Alpine.

===Chapters 12–15===
The events of chapters 12–15 take place over, approximately, a week in Alpine. The narrator arrives in Alpine filled with self-pity. He finds that he has no one to blame and that by some measures he has been successful for someone who started where he did. Nonetheless, he is deeply dissatisfied.

The first thing the narrator does in Alpine is going to a motel and sleep for twenty-four hours. When he wakes up he heads to the Daisy Duck bar to look for Bobby Miller. At the bar, he finds Bobbi, a waitress, who is Bobby&#x27;s girlfriend. The narrator talks and dances with her. Bobbi then introduces the narrator to Bobby and a man called the King, who has just come into the bar. The narrator is struck by Bobby&#x27;s calm and gentle disposition. King on the other hand is a rough biker, who makes threatening remarks about running greasers out of town. Miller invites the narrator to crash at his place but the narrator decides to stay in the motel.

The narrator continues describing his life story. After his discharge from the Air Force, the narrator returned to Riverbank. He discovered that his brother had stolen all of his savings from a joint bank account. The narrator decided to attend a local community college. There he was influenced deeply by a creative writing professor, Doc Jennings. Doc Jennings encouraged the students to think for themselves and not to blindly accept conventional wisdom. At one point, the teacher called the narrator to his office to encourage him to leave school if he wants to be a writer. After a year of classes, the narrator finally took Doc Jennings&#x27;s advice and left school. He went to Los Angeles and took the exam to enter the police department.

While driving in Los Angeles, the narrator was pulled over by an unmarked police car. The narrator, who was drunk, tried to drive away. Eventually, he was stopped by a roadblock. When the case came to court the narrator refused the public defender and decided to represent himself. Several judges tried to talk him out of going to trial. The narrator went ahead with the case and was able to convince the jury that he was not guilty because the police car was unmarked, and, therefore, it was natural for someone who grew up in a rough area to try to flee.

Immediately after the trial, the narrator went looking for his friend Al. He learned from the landlord that Al had been on a drinking binge for a full month. The narrator found Al passed out in his apartment. The floor was covered with eggshells; apparently, the only type of food Al had been eating. The narrator took Al to the county hospital but they would not admit him because he was drunk. Then the narrator took to Al to a psychiatric hospital next door. There the narrator had to convince the admitting doctor that Al was insane in order to have him admitted. During the observation period, Al&#x27;s sister visited but she sneaked past the nurse when she came in. This caused the doctors to think Al was imagining he had visitors. As a result, Al had to serve two months in a criminal psychiatric hospital. The incident with Al and his arrest convinced the narrator to leave Los Angeles. The narrator went to San Francisco and enrolled at San Francisco State to study math and creative writing.

The narrator wrote a manuscript about his relationship with Alice and the fights between Mexicans and Oakies in his hometown. The narrator showed the manuscript to a supportive creative writing professor. The professor thought highly of the work but said that no one would publish a book about Mexicans. Giving up on writing, the narrator decided to go to law school. He attended night classes at San Francisco Law School and worked during the day as a copy boy at a newspaper. After five years he graduated from law school.

Shortly after arriving in Alpine, the narrator crashed his car. He had been smoking marijuana that Scott, a friend of Bobby, had brought from India. He had also mistakenly taken two tabs of acid that were in an aspirin bottle. When the narrator comes off his trip, he finds he is in King&#x27;s basement. Exploring the basement, he finds some recording equipment and drugs. He takes the drugs and listens to music. When he comes to, he is sitting with King on the porch. King tells him the sheriff is looking for him. The narrator and King strike up a friendship. Both are serious about drinking. After talking and drinking for a while, the two head to town for more beer in spite of the risk of being spotted by the sheriff.

After picking up more beer at the local grocery store, they head to a park where a group of hippies are gathering after a protest at the house of Gene McNamara. At the gathering, the narrator gets into an altercation because the hippies think he is hassling a pair of nuns. Although the narrator does not know it, someone has written: “Fuck the Pope” on his back.

King takes the narrator to the bus station. While waiting for the bus to leave, King and the narrator continue talking. They have become friends and exchange symbolic gifts. Just before the bus leaves and King gives the narrator his phone number.

===Chapter 16===
The final section, while comprising relatively few pages, covers a longer period than the other sections. The section is also different in that for the most part it does not contain flashbacks to previous events in the narrator&#x27;s life. The section begins with the narrator stepping off the bus in Vail. Broke, he works in a series of low-paying jobs, repeatedly getting fired. In his free time he drinks, reads Dylan Thomas, reads Konrad Lorenz, and listens to Bob Dylan.

After several months in Vail, he decides to return to El Paso, where he was born, “to see if I could find the object of my quest.” In El Paso, he visits his old house and walks around his old neighborhood. Overcome by memories and sadness, he decides to go across the border to Juarez. In Juarez, he is moved to see so many Mexicans with their brown skin and, most of all, people speaking Spanish openly in public. He remembers an incident in elementary school when the principal told him and his brother they could not speak Spanish at school. For the first time in his life, he is attracted to Mexican women. His earlier loves fade to distant memories in the presence of so many beautiful brown-skinned women.

The narrator goes to a bar, which he observes is the same as any bar in any city in the United States. In the bar, he meets two prostitutes and spends a week with them, eating, drinking, and having sex, until his money runs out. The narrator gets into an argument with a clerk at the hotel after complaining about the lack of heat in his room. He winds up in jail. When he is brought before the judge he tries to explain in his broken Spanish that he is an attorney from the United States. The female judge lectures him on the behavior of Americans coming across the border to sleep with prostitutes and on his inability to speak proper Spanish. He accepts a fine and is allowed to leave. Feeling neither Mexican nor American the narrator heads back across the border. He does not have any papers but manages to convince the border guard that he is an American citizen.

Across the border, he pawns his few belongings and calls his brother. His brother tells him about the La Raza movement that is taking shape in East L.A. In a flash, the narrator sees this as his destiny. He immediately decides to head for Los Angeles. He imagines that he will call a meeting and becomes an organizer; he will start a movement of Brown Buffalos. After years of searching for an identity, he feels he has finally found his place. The story ends with the narrator arriving in Los Angeles, ready to become a revolutionary activist.

<text>The Revolt of the Cockroach People is a novel by Oscar Zeta Acosta. It tells the story of a Chicano lawyer, &quot;Buffalo Zeta Brown&quot;, fictionalizing events from Oscar Acosta&#x27;s own life, including the East L.A. walkouts at Garfield High School, the founding of the Brown Berets, the Christmas protests at St. Basil&#x27;s church, the Castro v. Superior Court decision of 1970, Acosta&#x27;s run for sheriff of Los Angeles County later that year, the Chicano National Moratorium, and the death of Ruben Salazar, who is referred to as &quot;Roland Zanzibar&quot; in the novel. The novel is written in the style of Gonzo journalism, the conventions of which, he helped codify with American journalist and friend Hunter S. Thompson. The story of Buffalo Z. Brown, a persona of the author, satirizes the East L.A. Chicano movement through the eyes of a participant observer. Acosta uses the historical events of the late 1960s and early 1970s &quot;as the context for the construction of a Chicano identity and the realization of a revolutionary class consciousness.&quot;

Acosta frames Brown as a lawyer who understands the United States&#x27;s legal system as both arbitrary and differential, and therefore comes to the realization that an &quot;objective truth&quot; can never materialize &quot;either in the courtroom or elsewhere.&quot; Through the character of Brown, Acosta acknowledges that what is understood as &quot;truth&quot; is a social construct or cultural convention. This realization is destabilizing yet invigorating for Brown, who understands that law can function both &quot;as a tool of repression but it may also be used to project a radically new form of legality that cannot be achieved within present institutions,&quot; as described by Mexican-American scholar Ramón Saldívar. Saldívar characterizes this as an important moment for Brown (and Acosta), as he understands that &quot;ideological commitment to a cause&quot; is not a matter of identifying &quot;truth&quot; or &quot;falsehood&quot; but an &quot;issue of taking sides in a struggle between embattled groups.&quot;

== Plot ==
The novel starts &quot;in medias res&quot;, during the Christmas protest at St. Basil Catholic Church. Brown becomes involved with the Chicano movement when he moved to Los Angeles in 1968 while looking to write a book. He spent three years with the Chicano Militants, defending them in various court cases and assisting in organizing protests and marches. The novel depicts the Chicano movement in the fictional barrio of &quot;Tooner Flats&quot; in East Los Angeles. The leaders are eventually indicted on charges of conspiracy to disrupt the schools. Brown defends them and wins.

== Reception ==
As Marcial Gonzalez notes, &quot;not all critics have shared a favorable opinion of Acosta&#x27;s novel&quot;. Critics argued the novel gave shallow explorations of ethnicity, and exaggerates many aspects of the Chicano movement in East LA in a manner not representative to the real events. During this time, Chicano literature assisted in shaping the cultural tropes and concepts of Chicanismo, &quot;creat[ing] socially engaged works fusing mimetic reflections of the socio-political conditions of Chicana/os with myths and symbols.&quot; Critics hold a shared interpretation that the novel satirizes aspects of Chicanismo and criticizes the contradictions within the movement. Marc Priewe argues that Acosta proposes a &quot;reflexive nationalism,&quot; against essentialist attitudes of the Chicano movement. Some believe that reception from Chicano critics reject Acosta&#x27;s novel because of its criticism of Chicano nationalism building at the time.

The &quot;Times&quot; noted that, &quot;Ms. Berkley&#x27;s actions were among a series over the last five years in which she pushed legislation or twisted the arms of federal regulators to pursue an agenda that is aligned with the business interests of her husband, Dr. Larry Lehrner.&quot;

On September 19, 2011, the ethics watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) released their annual &quot;Most Corrupt Members of Congress&quot; report. The report listed Berkley in the &quot;Dishonorable Mention&quot; category. Berkley was named in CREW&#x27;s &quot;Most Corrupt Members of Congress&quot; report for the second year in a row in 2012.

On July 9, 2012, the United States House Committee on Ethics voted unanimously to form an investigative subcommittee to see whether Berkley used her official position to advocate for policy that benefited her family&#x27;s financial situation.

Berkley has said says about her husband, &quot;He works about 12 hours a day, seven days a week. I call him a doctor&#x27;s doctor.&quot; Lehrner&#x27;s medical practice has received attention during the campaign due to the House Ethics Committee&#x27;s investigation into Berkley&#x27;s efforts to save a kidney transplant center in which her husband has a financial interest. Laura Meyers of the &quot;Las Vegas Review-Journal&quot; wrote, &quot;Having Lehrner on the campaign trail with Berkley could remind voters of the ethics investigation—expose him to uncomfortable questions.&quot;

<doc id="414129" wikidata="Q1077320" url="?curid=414129" title="Catholic Church in Kenya">
<text>The Catholic Church in [[Kenya]] is part of the worldwide Catholic Church, under the spiritual leadership of the Kenyan Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Pope in the Vatican City.

The earliest traces of the Catholic Church in Kenya begin with the missionaries that penetrated the state in 1498, led by Vasco da Gama. Due to regional conflict, poor transportation, and a largely nomadic presence, it became more established in northern Kenya during the twentieth century.

==Demographics==

According to the Catholic Church official records, there are over 18 million baptised Catholics in Kenya (nearly 40% of the country&#x27;s population). According to the 2019 national housing census, 10.6 million Catholics in Kenya are strict adherents and attend Mass regularly. 

In 2020, there were over 3,644 priests working across more than 1,100 parishes.

== Organization ==
Within Kenya the hierarchy consists of:
* Archbishopric
** Bishopric
* Kisumu
** Bungoma
** Eldoret
** Homa Bay
** Kakamega
** Kisii
** Kitale
** Lodwar

* Mombasa
** Garissa
** Malindi

* Nairobi
** Kericho
** Kitui
** Machakos
** Nakuru
** Ngong

* Nyeri
** Embu
** Maralal
** Marsabit
** Meru
** Murang&#x27;a
** Nyahururu
== Notable Catholics in Kenya ==

* Ngina Kenyatta, former First Lady of Kenya
* Uhuru Kenyatta, President of Kenya
* Mwai Kibaki, former President of Kenya

<text>Coimbra University Radio (Portuguese: Rádio Universidade de Coimbra - RUC) is a university radio station of the Coimbra Academic Association (students&#x27; union) of the University of Coimbra in Coimbra, Portugal.

It broadcasts on 107.9 FM (also broadcasts on-line). The Center of Experimental Radio was founded in the 1940s but it was only on 1 March 1986 that the radio obtained the authorization to broadcast on FM.

The studios and offices of this university radio station are located in the main building of the Associação Académica de Coimbra, in the city centre.

The radio gives courses in radio programming, technic and news, that students from the University of Coimbra and everybody else can join.

In 2002, RUC broadcaster José Braga attempted to break the Guinness world record for the longest DJ Marathon previously achieved by the Swedish Kristian Bartos with 100 hours, 3 minutes and 22 seconds. Braga failed the attempt with a time of 68 hours, 37 minutes and 18 seconds.

For its 25th anniversary, the radio hosted concerts of the indie Swedish band the Radio Dept., and later Eleanor Friedberger from the rock duo The Fiery Furnaces and the Welsh songwriter Euros Childs.

<text>Eugene Chadbourne (born January 4, 1954) is an American banjoist, guitarist and music critic.

==Life and career==

Chadbourne was born in Mount Vernon, New York, but grew up in Boulder, Colorado. He started playing guitar when he was 11 or 12 years old, inspired by the Beatles and hoping to get the attention of girls. Although he was drawn to Jimi Hendrix and played in a garage band, he found rock and pop music too conventional. He gravitated to the avant-garde jazz of Anthony Braxton and Derek Bailey. Braxton persuaded Chadbourne to abandon his intention to enter journalism and instead pursue music.

During the early 1970s, he lived in Canada to avoid military service in the Vietnam War. Returning to the United States, he moved to New York City in the mid-1970s and played free improvisation with Henry Kaiser and John Zorn. Around this time, he released his first album, &quot;Solo Acoustic Guitar&quot;. In the early 1980s, he led the avant-rock band Shockabilly with Mark Kramer and David Licht.

Chadbourne explored other genres, playing with a Cajun band and a Russian folk band at a festival in Winnipeg. He mixed country, Western, and improvisation in the band LSD C&amp;W. For many years he was in a duo with Jimmy Carl Black, who played drums for Frank Zappa. He has also worked with Han Bennink, Fred Frith, Elliott Sharp, and Charles Tyler.

A solo album, &quot;Songs&quot; (Intakt, 1993), featured politically oriented originals, such as &quot;Hello Ceausescu&quot;, and covers, such as Nick Drake&#x27;s &quot;Thoughts of Mary Jane&quot;, Phil Ochs&#x27; &quot;Knock on the Door&quot;, and Floyd Tillman&#x27;s &quot;This Cold War With You&quot;.

Chadbourne invented an instrument known as the electric rake by attaching an electric guitar pickup to a rake. He played a duet of electric rake and classical piano with Bob Wiseman on Wiseman&#x27;s 1991 album &quot;Presented by Lake Michigan Soda&quot;. He also played the instrument on a Sun Ra tribute album.

<doc id="414141" wikidata="Q103397599" url="?curid=414141" title="Sinus node dysfunction">
<text>Sinus node dysfunction (SND), also known as sick sinus syndrome (SSS), is a group of abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) usually caused by a malfunction of the sinus node, the heart&#x27;s primary pacemaker. Tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome is a variant of sick sinus syndrome in which the arrhythmia alternates between fast and slow heart rates.

==Signs and symptoms==
Often sinus node dysfunction produces no symptoms, especially early in the disease course. Signs and symptoms usually appear in more advanced disease and more than 50% of patients will present with syncope or transient near-fainting spells as well as bradycardias that are accompanied by rapid heart rhythms, referred to as tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome Other presenting signs or symptoms can include confusion, fatigue, palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea. Patients can also present with symptoms of congestive heart failure, stroke or transient ischemic attacks due to the abnormal rhythm.

===Complications===
 The most common complication of sinus node dysfunction is the development of tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome with abnormal atrial rhythms such as atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and flutter. These rhythms increases the risk of clot formation in the atrium, embolization, and stroke.

Developing sinus arrest, sinus node exit block, sinus bradycardia, atrioventricular block, and other types of abnormal rhythms are also common complications. Sinus node dysfunction has a close association with the presence of atrial fibrillation due to their shared etiology of remodeling.

==Causes==
Sinus node dysfunction can be caused by intrinsic and extrinsic factors that affect the normal functioning of the sinus node. Intrinsic causes can include degeneration, dysfunction, or remodeling of the sinus node while extrinsic causes can create or worsen underlying atrial arrhythmias. Intrinsic causes tend to be responsible for permanent sinus node dysfunction while extrinsic causes are more commonly temporary.

=== Intrinsic causes ===
Age-related degenerative fibrosis of the sinus node is often identified as the most common intrinsic cause. Other intrinsic causes include inherited ion channel dysfunctions, remodeling diseases such as heart failure and atrial fibrillation, infiltrative diseases such as sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, hemochromatosis, and connective tissue diseases, inflammatory etiology such as rheumatic fever, Chagas disease, and Lyme disease, as well as atherosclerotic and ischemic changes to the sinus node artery.

Inherited sinus node dysfunction has been associated with mutations of the gene responsible for the formation of the alpha subunit of the sodium channel (SCN5A).

=== Extrinsic causes ===
Common cardiac pharmacology such as beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, sympatholytic medication, and other antiarrhythmics can alter sinus node function to create an arrhythmia such as sick sinus syndrome. Electrolyte abnormalities such as hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, and hypocalcemia can also alter normal sinus node functioning. Hypothyroidism, hypoxia, hypothermia, and various toxins have also been associated with sinus node dysfunctions.

==Diagnosis==
=== Electrocardiogram ===
The primary 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) finding in sinus node dysfunction is inappropriate sinus bradycardia. Sinus node dysfunction can also present with sudden sinus arrest with or without junctional escape, sinoatrial block, prolonged asystolic period followed by tachycardias, or tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome presenting as various atrial arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation, flutter, tachycardia, or paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.

=== Clinical diagnosis ===
Diagnosing sinus node dysfunction requires clinical symptoms as well as ECG abnormalities. If ECG findings cannot be identified, prolonged cardiac monitoring should be pursued either with a Holter monitor in an outpatient setting or telemetry while inpatient, due to the transient nature of abnormal ECG findings. If Holter or telemetry monitoring fails to identify ECG changes and suspicion of sinus node dysfunction remains high due to severe symptoms or episodes of syncope, implantable loop recorders should be considered for extended monitoring up to 24 months.

Exercise stress tests can be utilized to identify intrinsic causes of sinus node dysfunction. Tilt table tests can be used to discriminate bradycardia caused by dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system.

==Treatment==
The primary reason for considering treatment is the presence of symptoms. Pacemaker implantation is the primary treatment modality of symptomatic sinus node dysfunction. The goal of this treatment modality is to relieve symptoms associated with sinus node dysfunction and improve quality of life. Dual chamber pacemakers are preferred due to the possibility of developing atrioventricular block as well as long term cost-effectiveness relative to single-chamber atrial pacemakers.

In tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome, medication-based management can treat atrial tachyarrhythmias. However, these medications may exacerbate underlying bradyarrhythmia. Therefore, a dual-chamber pacemaker capable of managing atrial tachyarrhythmias as well as bradyarrhythmias is implanted before drug therapy is begun.

==Epidemiology==
Overall incidence of sinus node dysfunction increases with age with 1 in 1000 in adults over 45 years old and 1 in 600 cardiac patients over 65 years old. Sinus node dysfunction is the primary indication for approximately 30%-50% of all pacemaker implantation in the United States. Sinus node dysfunction is a relatively uncommon syndrome in the young and middle-aged population.

<doc id="414144" wikidata="Q191618" url="?curid=414144" title="Sterilization (microbiology)">
<text>Sterilization () refers to any process that removes, kills, or deactivates all forms of life (particularly microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria, spores, and unicellular eukaryotic organisms) and other biological agents (such as prions or viruses) present in fluid or on a specific surface or object. Sterilization can be achieved through various means, including heat, chemicals, irradiation, high pressure, and filtration. Sterilization is distinct from disinfection, sanitization, and pasteurization, in that those methods reduce rather than eliminate all forms of life and biological agents present. After sterilization, fluid or an object is referred to as being sterile or aseptic.

==Applications==

===Foods===
One of the first steps toward modernized sterilization was made by Nicolas Appert, who discovered that application of heat over a suitable period of time slowed the decay of foods and various liquids, preserving them for safe consumption for a longer time than was typical. Canning of foods is an extension of the same principle and has helped to reduce food borne illness (&quot;food poisoning&quot;). Other methods of sterilizing foods include ultra-high temperature processing (which uses a shorter duration of heating), food irradiation, and high pressure (pascalization).

In the context of food, sterility typically refers to &quot;commercial sterility&quot;, &quot;the absence of microorganisms capable of growing in the food at normal non-refrigerated conditions at which the food is likely to be held during distribution and storage&quot; according to the &quot;Codex Allimentarius&quot;.

===Medicine and surgery===

In general, surgical instruments and medications that enter an already aseptic part of the body (such as the bloodstream, or penetrating the skin) must be sterile. Examples of such instruments include scalpels, hypodermic needles, and artificial pacemakers. This is also essential in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals.

Preparation of injectable medications and intravenous solutions for fluid replacement therapy requires not only sterility but also well-designed containers to prevent entry of adventitious agents after initial product sterilization.

Most medical and surgical devices used in healthcare facilities are made of materials that are able to undergo steam sterilization. However, since 1950, there has been an increase in medical devices and instruments made of materials (e.g., plastics) that require low-temperature sterilization. Ethylene oxide gas has been used since the 1950s for heat- and moisture-sensitive medical devices. Within the past 15 years, a number of new, low-temperature sterilization systems (e.g., vaporized hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid immersion, ozone) have been developed and are being used to sterilize medical devices.

===Spacecraft===
There are strict international rules to protect the contamination of Solar System bodies from biological material from Earth. Standards vary depending on both the type of mission and its destination; the more likely a planet is considered to be habitable, the stricter the requirements are.

Many components of instruments used on spacecraft cannot withstand very high temperatures, so techniques not requiring excessive temperatures are used as tolerated, including heating to at least , chemical sterilization, oxidization, ultraviolet, and irradiation.

==Quantification==
The aim of sterilization is the reduction of initially present microorganisms or other potential pathogens. The degree of sterilization is commonly expressed by multiples of the decimal reduction time, or D-value, denoting the time needed to reduce the initial number formula_1 to one tenth (formula_2) of its original value. Then the number of microorganisms formula_3 after sterilization time formula_4 is given by:
:formula_5.
The D-value is a function of sterilization conditions and varies with the type of microorganism, temperature, water activity, pH, etc.. For steam sterilization (see below), typically the temperature, in degrees Celsius, is given as an index.

Theoretically, the likelihood of the survival of an individual microorganism is never zero. To compensate for this, the overkill method is often used. Using the overkill method, sterilization is performed by sterilizing for longer than is required to kill the bioburden present on or in the item being sterilized. This provides a sterility assurance level (SAL) equal to the probability of a non-sterile unit.

For high-risk applications, such as medical devices and injections, a sterility assurance level of at least 10−6 is required by the United States of America Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

==Heat==

===Steam===
Steam sterilization, also known as moist heat sterilization, uses heated saturated steam under pressure to inactivate or kill microorganisms via denaturation of macromolecules, primarily proteins. This method is a faster process than dry heat sterilization. Steam sterilization is performed using an autoclave, sometimes called a converter or steam sterilizer. The object or liquid is placed in the autoclave chamber, which is then sealed and heated using pressurized steam to a temperature set point for a defined period of time. Steam sterilization cycles can be categorized as either pre-vacuum or gravity displacement. Gravity displacement cycles rely on the lower density of the injected steam to force cooler, denser air out of the chamber drain. Steam Sterilization | Disinfection &amp; Sterilization Guidelines | Guidelines Library | Infection Control | CDC In comparison, pre-vacuum cycles create a vacuum in the chamber to remove cool dry air prior to injecting saturated steam, resulting in faster heating and shorter cycle times. Typical steam sterilization cycles are between 3 and 30 minutes at at , but adjustments may be made depending on the bioburden of the article being sterilized, its resistance (D-value) to steam sterilization, the article&#x27;s heat tolerance, and the required sterility assurance level. Following the completion of a cycle, liquids in a pressurized autoclave must be cooled slowly to avoid boiling over when the pressure is released. This may be achieved by gradually depressurizing the sterilization chamber and allowing liquids to evaporate under a negative pressure, while cooling the contents.

Proper autoclave treatment will inactivate all resistant bacterial spores in addition to fungi, bacteria, and viruses, but is not expected to eliminate all prions, which vary in their heat resistance. For prion elimination, various recommendations state for 60 minutes or for at least 18 minutes. The 263K scrapie prion is inactivated relatively quickly by such sterilization procedures; however, other strains of scrapie and strains of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CKD) and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) are more resistant. Using mice as test animals, one experiment showed that heating BSE positive brain tissue at for 18 minutes resulted in only a 2.5 log decrease in prion infectivity.

Most autoclaves have meters and charts that record or display information, particularly temperature and pressure as a function of time. The information is checked to ensure that the conditions required for sterilization have been met. Indicator tape is often placed on the packages of products prior to autoclaving, and some packaging incorporates indicators. The indicator changes color when exposed to steam, providing a visual confirmation.

Biological indicators can also be used to independently confirm autoclave performance. Simple biological indicator devices are commercially available, based on microbial spores. Most contain spores of the heat-resistant microbe &quot;Geobacillus stearothermophilus&quot; (formerly &quot;Bacillus stearothermophilus&quot;), which is extremely resistant to steam sterilization. Biological indicators may take the form of glass vials of spores and liquid media, or as spores on strips of paper inside glassine envelopes. These indicators are placed in locations where it is difficult for steam to reach to verify that steam is penetrating that area.

For autoclaving, cleaning is critical. Extraneous biological matter or grime may shield organisms from steam penetration. Proper cleaning can be achieved through physical scrubbing, sonication, ultrasound, or pulsed air.

Pressure cooking and canning is analogous to autoclaving, and when performed correctly renders food sterile.

To sterilize waste materials that are chiefly composed of liquid, a purpose-built effluent decontamination system can be utilized. These devices can function using a variety of sterilants, although using heat via steam is most common.

=== Dry ===
Dry heat was the first method of sterilization and is a longer process than moist heat sterilization. The destruction of microorganisms through the use of dry heat is a gradual phenomenon. With longer exposure to lethal temperatures, the number of killed microorganisms increases. Forced ventilation of hot air can be used to increase the rate at which heat is transferred to an organism and reduce the temperature and amount of time needed to achieve sterility. At higher temperatures, shorter exposure times are required to kill organisms. This can reduce heat-induced damage to food products.
The standard setting for a hot air oven is at least two hours at . A rapid method heats air to for 6 minutes for unwrapped objects and 12 minutes for wrapped objects. Dry heat has the advantage that it can be used on powders and other heat-stable items that are adversely affected by steam (e.g., it does not cause rusting of steel objects).

===Flaming===
Flaming is done to inoculation loops and straight-wires in microbiology labs for streaking. Leaving the loop in the flame of a Bunsen burner or alcohol burner until it glows red ensures that any infectious agent is inactivated or killed. This is commonly used for small metal or glass objects, but not for large objects (see Incineration below). However, during the initial heating, infectious material may be sprayed from the wire surface before it is killed, contaminating nearby surfaces and objects. Therefore, special heaters have been developed that surround the inoculating loop with a heated cage, ensuring that such sprayed material does not further contaminate the area. Another problem is that gas flames may leave carbon or other residues on the object if the object is not heated enough. A variation on flaming is to dip the object in a 70% or more concentrated solution of ethanol, then briefly leave the object in the flame of a Bunsen burner. The ethanol will ignite and burn off rapidly, leaving less residue than a gas flame

===Incineration===
Incineration is a waste treatment process that involves the combustion of organic substances contained in waste materials. This method also burns any organism to ash. It is used to sterilize medical and other biohazardous waste before it is discarded with non-hazardous waste. Bacteria incinerators are mini furnaces that incinerate and kill off any microorganisms that may be on an inoculating loop or wire.

===Tyndallization===

Named after John Tyndall, tyndallization is an obsolete and lengthy process designed to reduce the level of activity of sporulating microbes that are left by a simple boiling water method. The process involves boiling for a period of time (typically 20 minutes) at atmospheric pressure, cooling, incubating for a day, and then repeating the process a total of three to four times. The incubation allow heat-resistant spores surviving the previous boiling period to germinate and form the heat-sensitive vegetative (growing) stage, which can be killed by the next boiling step. This is effective because many spores are stimulated to grow by the heat shock. The procedure only works for media that can support bacterial growth, and will not sterilize non-nutritive substrates like water. Tyndallization is also ineffective against prions.

===Glass bead sterilizers===
Glass bead sterilizers work by heating glass beads to . Instruments are then quickly doused in these glass beads, which heat the object while physically scraping contaminants off their surface. Glass bead sterilizers were once a common sterilization method employed in dental offices as well as biological laboratories, but are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to be used as a sterilizers since 1997. They are still popular in European and Israeli dental practices, although there are no current evidence-based guidelines for using this sterilizer.

==Chemical sterilization==
Chemicals are also used for sterilization. Heating provides a reliable way to rid objects of all transmissible agents, but it is not always appropriate if it will damage heat-sensitive materials such as biological materials, fiber optics, electronics, and many plastics. In these situations, chemicals either in a gaseous or liquid form, can be used as sterilants. While the use of gas and liquid chemical sterilants avoids the problem of heat damage, users must ensure that the article to be sterilized is chemically compatible with the sterilant being used and that the sterilant is able to reach all surfaces that must be sterilized (typically cannot penetrate packaging). In addition, the use of chemical sterilants poses new challenges for workplace safety, as the properties that make chemicals effective sterilants usually make them harmful to humans. The procedure for removing sterilant residue from the sterilized materials varies depending on the chemical and process that is used.

===Ethylene oxide===

Ethylene oxide (EO, EtO) gas treatment is one of the common methods used to sterilize, pasteurize, or disinfect items because of its wide range of material compatibility. It is also used to process items that are sensitive to processing with other methods, such as radiation (gamma, electron beam, X-ray), heat (moist or dry), or other chemicals. Ethylene oxide treatment is the most common chemical sterilization method, used for approximately 70% of total sterilizations, and for over 50% of all disposable medical devices.

Ethylene oxide treatment is generally carried out between with relative humidity above 30% and a gas concentration between 200 and 800 mg/L. Typically, the process lasts for several hours. Ethylene oxide is highly effective, as it penetrates all porous materials, and it can penetrate through some plastic materials and films. Ethylene oxide kills all known microorganisms, such as bacteria (including spores), viruses, and fungi (including yeasts and moulds), and is compatible with almost all materials even when used repeatedly. It is flammable, toxic, and carcinogenic; however, only with a reported potential for some adverse health effects when not used in compliance with published requirements. Ethylene oxide sterilizers and processes require biological validation after sterilizer installation, significant repairs, or process changes.

The traditional process consists of a preconditioning phase (in a separate room or cell), a processing phase (more commonly in a vacuum vessel and sometimes in a pressure rated vessel), and an aeration phase (in a separate room or cell) to remove EO residues and lower by-products such as ethylene chlorohydrin (EC or ECH) and, of lesser importance, ethylene glycol (EG). An alternative process, known as all-in-one processing, also exists for some products whereby all three phases are performed in the vacuum or pressure rated vessel. This latter option can facilitate faster overall processing time and residue dissipation.

The most common EO processing method is the gas chamber. To benefit from economies of scale, EO has traditionally been delivered by filling a large chamber with a combination of gaseous EO, either as pure EO, or with other gases used as diluents; diluents include chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), and carbon dioxide.

Ethylene oxide is still widely used by medical device manufacturers. Since EO is explosive at concentrations above 3%, EO was traditionally supplied with an inert carrier gas, such as a CFC or HCFC. The use of CFCs or HCFCs as the carrier gas was banned because of concerns of ozone depletion. These halogenated hydrocarbons are being replaced by systems using 100% EO, because of regulations and the high cost of the blends. In hospitals, most EO sterilizers use single-use cartridges because of the convenience and ease of use compared to the former plumbed gas cylinders of EO blends.

It is important to adhere to patient and healthcare personnel government specified limits of EO residues in and/or on processed products, operator exposure after processing, during storage and handling of EO gas cylinders, and environmental emissions produced when using EO.

The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the permissible exposure limit (PEL) at 1 ppm – calculated as an 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA) – and 5 ppm as a 15-minute excursion limit (EL). The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health&#x27;s (NIOSH) immediately dangerous to life and health limit (IDLH) for EO is 800 ppm. The odor threshold is around 500 ppm, so EO is imperceptible until concentrations are well above the OSHA PEL. Therefore, OSHA recommends that continuous gas monitoring systems be used to protect workers using EO for processing.

===Nitrogen dioxide===
Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) gas is a rapid and effective sterilant for use against a wide range of microorganisms, including common bacteria, viruses, and spores. The unique physical properties of NO2 gas allow for sterilant dispersion in an enclosed environment at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The mechanism for lethality is the degradation of DNA in the spore&#x27;s core through nitration of the phosphate backbone, which kills the exposed organism as it absorbs NO2. This degradations occurs at even very low concentrations of the gas. NO2 has a boiling point of at sea level, which results in a relatively high saturated vapour pressure at ambient temperature. Because of this, liquid NO2 may be used as a convenient source for the sterilant gas. Liquid NO2 is often referred to by the name of its dimer, dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4). Additionally, the low levels of concentration required, coupled with the high vapour pressure, assures that no condensation occurs on the devices being sterilized. This means that no aeration of the devices is required immediately following the sterilization cycle. NO2 is also less corrosive than other sterilant gases, and is compatible with most medical materials and adhesives.

The most-resistant organism (MRO) to sterilization with NO2 gas is the spore of &quot;Geobacillus stearothermophilus&quot;, which is the same MRO for both steam and hydrogen peroxide sterilization processes. The spore form of &quot;G. stearothermophilus&quot; has been well characterized over the years as a biological indicator in sterilization applications. Microbial inactivation of &quot;G. stearothermophilus&quot; with NO2 gas proceeds rapidly in a log-linear fashion, as is typical of other sterilization processes. Noxilizer, Inc. has commercialized this technology to offer contract sterilization services for medical devices at its Baltimore, Maryland (USA) facility. This has been demonstrated in Noxilizer&#x27;s lab in multiple studies and is supported by published reports from other labs. These same properties also allow for quicker removal of the sterilant and residual gases through aeration of the enclosed environment. The combination of rapid lethality and easy removal of the gas allows for shorter overall cycle times during the sterilization (or decontamination) process and a lower level of sterilant residuals than are found with other sterilization methods. Eniware, LLC has developed a portable, power-free sterilizer that uses no electricity, heat, or water. The 25 liter unit makes sterilization of surgical instruments possible for austere forward surgical teams, in health centers throughout the world with intermittent or no electricity and in disaster relief and humanitarian crisis situations. The 4-hour cycle uses a single use gas generation ampoule and a disposable scrubber to remove NO2 gas.

===Ozone===
Ozone is used in industrial settings to sterilize water and air, as well as a disinfectant for surfaces. It has the benefit of being able to oxidize most organic matter. On the other hand, it is a toxic and unstable gas that must be produced on-site, so it is not practical to use in many settings.

Ozone offers many advantages as a sterilant gas; ozone is a very efficient sterilant because of its strong oxidizing properties (E=2.076 vs SHE) capable of destroying a wide range of pathogens, including prions, without the need for handling hazardous chemicals since the ozone is generated within the sterilizer from medical-grade oxygen. The high reactivity of ozone means that waste ozone can be destroyed by passing over a simple catalyst that reverts it to oxygen and ensures that the cycle time is relatively short. The disadvantage of using ozone is that the gas is very reactive and very hazardous. The NIOSH&#x27;s IDLH for ozone is smaller than the IDLH for ethylene oxide. NIOSH and OSHA have set the PEL for ozone at , calculated as an 8-hour time-weighted average. The sterilant gas manufacturers include many safety features in their products but prudent practice is to provide continuous monitoring of exposure to ozone, in order to provide a rapid warning in the event of a leak. Monitors for determining workplace exposure to ozone are commercially available.

===Glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde===

Glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde solutions (also used as fixatives) are accepted liquid sterilizing agents, provided that the immersion time is sufficiently long. To kill all spores in a clear liquid can take up to 22 hours with glutaraldehyde and even longer with formaldehyde. The presence of solid particles may lengthen the required period or render the treatment ineffective. Sterilization of blocks of tissue can take much longer, due to the time required for the fixative to penetrate. Glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde are volatile, and toxic by both skin contact and inhalation. Glutaraldehyde has a short shelf-life (&lt;2 weeks), and is expensive. Formaldehyde is less expensive and has a much longer shelf-life if some methanol is added to inhibit polymerization of the chemical to paraformaldehyde, but is much more volatile. Formaldehyde is also used as a gaseous sterilizing agent; in this case, it is prepared on-site by depolymerization of solid paraformaldehyde. Many vaccines, such as the original Salk polio vaccine, are sterilized with formaldehyde.

===Hydrogen peroxide===
Hydrogen peroxide, in both liquid and as vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP), is another chemical sterilizing agent. Hydrogen peroxide is a strong oxidant, which allows it to destroy a wide range of pathogens. Hydrogen peroxide is used to sterilize heat- or temperature-sensitive articles, such as rigid endoscopes. In medical sterilization, hydrogen peroxide is used at higher concentrations, ranging from around 35% up to 90%. The biggest advantage of hydrogen peroxide as a sterilant is the short cycle time. Whereas the cycle time for ethylene oxide may be 10 to 15 hours, some modern hydrogen peroxide sterilizers have a cycle time as short as 28 minutes.

Drawbacks of hydrogen peroxide include material compatibility, a lower capability for penetration and operator health risks. Products containing cellulose, such as paper, cannot be sterilized using VHP and products containing nylon may become brittle. The penetrating ability of hydrogen peroxide is not as good as ethylene oxide and so there are limitations on the length and diameter of the lumen of objects that can be effectively sterilized. Hydrogen peroxide is a primary irritant and the contact of the liquid solution with skin will cause bleaching or ulceration depending on the concentration and contact time. It is relatively non-toxic when diluted to low concentrations, but is a dangerous oxidizer at high concentrations (&gt; 10% w/w). The vapour is also hazardous, primarily affecting the eyes and respiratory system. Even short-term exposures can be hazardous and NIOSH has set the IDLH at 75 ppm, less than 1/10 the IDLH for ethylene oxide (800 ppm). Prolonged exposure to lower concentrations can cause permanent lung damage and consequently, OSHA has set the permissible exposure limit to 1.0 ppm, calculated as an 8-hour time-weighted average. Sterilizer manufacturers go to great lengths to make their products safe through careful design and incorporation of many safety features, though there are still workplace exposures of hydrogen peroxide from gas sterilizers documented in the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. When using any type of gas sterilizer, prudent work practices should include good ventilation, a continuous gas monitor for hydrogen peroxide, and good work practices and training.

Vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) is used to sterilize large enclosed and sealed areas, such as entire rooms and aircraft interiors.

Although toxic, VHP breaks down in a short time to water and oxygen.

===Peracetic acid===
Peracetic acid (0.2%) is a recognized sterilant by the FDA for use in sterilizing medical devices such as endoscopes. Peracetic acid which is also known as peroxyacetic acid is a chemical compound often used in disinfectants such as sanitizers. It is most commonly produced by the reaction of acetic acid with hydrogen peroxide by using an acid catalyst. Peracetic acid is never sold in un-stabilized solutions which is why it is considered to be environmentally friendly. Peracetic acid is a colorless liquid and the molecular formula of peracetic acid is C2H4O3 or CH3COOOH. More recently, peracetic acid is being used throughout the world as more people are using fumigation to decontaminate surfaces to reduce the risk of COVID-19 and other diseases.

===Potential for chemical sterilization of prions===
Prions are highly resistant to chemical sterilization. Treatment with aldehydes, such as formaldehyde, have actually been shown to increase prion resistance. Hydrogen peroxide (3%) used or 1 hour was shown to be ineffective, providing less than 3 logs (10−3) reduction in contamination. Iodine, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, and peracetic acid also fail this test (1 hour treatment). Only chlorine, phenolic compounds, guanidinium thiocyanate, and sodium hydroxide reduce prion levels by more than 4 logs; chlorine (too corrosive to use on certain objects) and sodium hydroxide are the most consistent. Many studies have shown the effectiveness of sodium hydroxide.

==Radiation sterilization==
Sterilization can be achieved using electromagnetic radiation, such as ultraviolet light (UV), X-rays, and gamma rays, or irradiation by subatomic particles such as electron beams. Electromagnetic or particulate radiation can be energetic enough to ionize atoms or molecules (ionizing radiation), or less energetic atoms or molecules (non-ionizing radiation).

===Non-ionizing radiation sterilization===

UV irradiation (from a germicidal lamp) is useful for sterilization of surfaces and some transparent objects. Many objects that are transparent to visible light absorb UV. UV irradiation is routinely used to sterilize the interiors of biological safety cabinets between uses, but is ineffective in shaded areas, including areas under dirt (which may become polymerized after prolonged irradiation, so that it is very difficult to remove). It also damages some plastics, such as polystyrene foam if exposed for prolonged periods of time.

===Ionizing radiation sterilization===
The safety of irradiation facilities is regulated by the International Atomic Energy Agency of the United Nations and monitored by the different national Nuclear Regulatory Commissions (NRC). The radiation exposure accidents that have occurred in the past are documented by the agency and thoroughly analyzed to determine the cause and improvement potential. Such improvements are then mandated to retrofit existing facilities and future design.

Gamma radiation is very penetrating, and is commonly used for sterilization of disposable medical equipment, such as syringes, needles, cannulas and IV sets, and food. It is emitted by a radioisotope, usually cobalt-60 (60Co) or caesium-137 (137Cs), which have photon energies of up to 1.3 and 0.66 MeV, respectively.

Use of a radioisotope requires shielding for the safety of the operators while in use and in storage. With most designs, the radioisotope is lowered into a water-filled source storage pool, which absorbs radiation and allows maintenance personnel to enter the radiation shield. One variant keeps the radioisotope under water at all times and lowers the product to be irradiated in the water in hermetically sealed bells; no further shielding is required for such designs. Other uncommonly used designs are dry storage, providing movable shields that reduce radiation levels in areas of the irradiation chamber, etc. An incident in Decatur, Georgia, USA, where water-soluble caesium-137 leaked into the source storage pool, required Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intervention and led to the use of this radioisotope being almost entirely discontinued in favor of the more costly, non-water-soluble cobalt-60. Cobalt-60 gamma photons have about twice the energy, and hence greater penetrating range, of caesium-137-produced radiation.

Electron beam processing is also commonly used for sterilization. Electron beams use an on-off technology and provide a much higher dosing rate than gamma or X-rays. Due to the higher dose rate, less exposure time is needed and thereby any potential degradation to polymers is reduced. Because electrons carry a charge, electron beams are less penetrating than both gamma and X-rays. Facilities rely on substantial concrete shields to protect workers and the environment from radiation exposure.

High-energy X-rays (produced by &quot;bremsstrahlung&quot;) allow irradiation of large packages and pallet loads of medical devices. They are sufficiently penetrating to treat multiple pallet loads of low-density packages with very good dose uniformity ratios. X-ray sterilization does not require chemical or radioactive material: high-energy X-rays are generated at high intensity by an X-ray generator that does not require shielding when not in use. X-rays are generated by bombarding a dense material (target) such as tantalum or tungsten with high-energy electrons, in a process known as &quot;bremsstrahlung&quot; conversion. These systems are energy-inefficient, requiring much more electrical energy than other systems for the same result.

Irradiation with X-rays, gamma rays, or electrons does not make materials radioactive, because the energy used is too low. Generally an energy of at least 10 MeV is needed to induce radioactivity in a material. Neutrons and very high-energy particles can make materials radioactive, but have good penetration, whereas lower energy particles (other than neutrons) cannot make materials radioactive, but have poorer penetration.

Sterilization by irradiation with gamma rays may however affect material properties.

Irradiation is used by the United States Postal Service to sterilize mail in the Washington, D.C. area. Some foods (e.g., spices and ground meats) are sterilized by irradiation.

Subatomic particles may be more or less penetrating and may be generated by a radioisotope or a device, depending upon the type of particle.

==Sterile filtration==
Fluids that would be damaged by heat, irradiation, or chemical sterilization, such as drug solution, can be sterilized by microfiltration using membrane filters. This method is commonly used for heat labile pharmaceuticals and protein solutions in medicinal drug processing. A microfilter with pore size of usually 0.22 μm will effectively remove microorganisms. Some Staphylococcal species have, however, been shown to be flexible enough to pass through 0.22 μm filters. In the processing of biologics, viruses must be removed or inactivated, requiring the use of nanofilters with a smaller pore size (20–50 nm). Smaller pore sizes lower the flow rate, so in order to achieve higher total throughput or to avoid premature blockage, pre-filters might be used to protect small pore membrane filters. Tangential flow filtration (TFF) and alternating tangential flow (ATF) systems also reduce particulate accumulation and blockage.

Membrane filters used in production processes are commonly made from materials such as mixed cellulose ester or polyethersulfone (PES). The filtration equipment and the filters themselves may be purchased as pre-sterilized disposable units in sealed packaging or must be sterilized by the user, generally by autoclaving at a temperature that does not damage the fragile filter membranes. To ensure proper functioning of the filter, the membrane filters are integrity tested post-use and sometimes before use. The nondestructive integrity test assures that the filter is undamaged and is a regulatory requirement. Typically, terminal pharmaceutical sterile filtration is performed inside of a cleanroom to prevent contamination.

==Preservation of sterility==

Instruments that have undergone sterilization can be maintained in such condition by containment in sealed packaging until use.

Aseptic technique is the act of maintaining sterility during procedures.

<doc id="414152" wikidata="Q4551109" url="?curid=414152" title="1601 (Mark Twain)">
<text>[Date: 1601.] Conversation, as it was by the Social Fireside, in the Time of the Tudors. or simply 1601 is the title of a short risqué squib by Mark Twain, first published anonymously in 1880, and finally acknowledged by the author in 1906.

Written as an extract from the diary of an &quot;old man&quot;, Queen Elizabeth I&#x27;s &quot;cup-bearer&quot;, the pamphlet purports to record a conversation between Elizabeth and several famous writers of the day. The topics discussed are scatological, notably flatulence, flatulence humor, and sex.

&quot;1601&quot; was, according to Edward Wagenknecht, &quot;the most famous piece of pornography in American literature.&quot; However, it was more ribaldry than pornography; its content was more in the nature of irreverent and vulgar comedic shock than obscenity for sexual arousal.

Before the court decisions in the United States in 1959–1966 that legalized the publication of &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover,&quot; &quot;Tropic of Cancer,&quot; and &quot;Fanny Hill,&quot; the piece continued to be considered unprintable. It was circulated clandestinely in privately printed limited editions.

==Content==
The diarist describes a conversation in the presence of the queen between various famous Elizabethans during which one of the company passes gas:

:&quot;In ye heat of ye talk it befel yt one did breake wind, yielding an exceding mightie and distresfull stink, whereat all did laugh full sore.&quot;

The Queen asks about the source and receives various replies. &quot;Lady Alice&quot; and &quot;Lady Margery&quot; both deny passing gas, the first saying:

:&quot;Good your grace, an&#x27; I had room for such a thundergust within mine ancient bowels, &#x27;tis not in reason I coulde discharge ye same and live to thank God for yt He did choose handmaid so humble whereby to shew his power. Nay, &#x27;tis not I yt have broughte forth this rich o&#x27;ermastering fog, this fragrant gloom, so pray you seeke ye further.&quot;

Ben Jonson, Francis Bacon and William Shakespeare (referred to as &#x27;Shaxpur&#x27;) also deny having passed gas, though they have different opinions about the merits of flatulence. Bacon considers it a &quot;great performance&quot; beyond his abilities, and Shakespeare is astounded by its &quot;firmament-clogging rottenness&quot;. Walter Raleigh admits to it, but confesses that it was not up to his usual standards, demonstrating his abilities by letting out an even louder one.

From there, the talk proceeds to manners and customs. Shakespeare tells a story about a prince with an enormous sexual appetite, taking ten &quot;maidenheddes&quot; a night followed by copious masturbation. Raleigh describes an American tribe, members of which have sex only once every seven years. The queen speaks to a young lady-in-waiting who comments on the growth of her pubic hair, on which Francis Beaumont compliments her. The queen says that Francois Rabelais had once told her about a man who had a &quot;double pair&quot; of bollocks, which leads to a discussion on the correct spelling of the word.

Shakespeare then reads from his works &quot;Henry IV&quot; and &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot;, which the diarist says she finds tedious. She then comments on the sexual misadventures of the people present, remarking that &quot;when pricks were stiff and cunts not loathe to take ye stiffness out of them, who of this company was sinless&quot;. Alice and Margery were &quot;whores from ye cradle&quot;, but now they are old and they spout religion. The characters then discuss the work of Cervantes and an up-and-coming young painter called Rubens.

The &quot;diary&quot; ends with a story told by Raleigh about a woman who avoided being raped by an &quot;olde archbishoppe&quot; by asking him to urinate in front of her, which rendered him impotent.

==Publication history==
The squib was originally written in 1876 for &quot;a highly respectable, all-male writing group&quot; as an exercise in the style of Rabelais. It was first published in the &quot;incredibly rare&quot; Cleveland edition of 1880, which is believed to number only four copies. The original edition was anonymous. While visiting West Point in 1881, Twain discovered that a man he met, Charles Erskine Scott Wood, had access to a private printing press. Twain asked Wood to print off a new edition of fifty copies (now known as the &quot;West Point edition&quot;), which came out in 1882. Twain acknowledged authorship in 1906.

The skit remained unprintable by mainstream publishers until the 1960s. It continued to be published by small private presses. Its characterization as &quot;pornography&quot; was satirized by Franklin J. Meine in the introduction to the 1939 edition. Another little-known edition was printed from hand-set type by John Hecht in Chicago in 1951.

In 1978, the &quot;Lazarus Edition&quot; of 200 copies was published. It consisted of newly discovered pages of a private printing from the 20s with a new, wood-engraved portrait of Mark Twain, made by Barry Moser.

<text>Alojz Rigele (8 February 1879 – 14 February 1940) was a Slovak sculptor and painter. He spent most of his life working in today&#x27;s Bratislava, where numerous examples of his statues survive to this day. Rigele was considered to be among the leading sculptors in Slovakia before World War I. His specialty was sculpture, especially portrait.

Together with Robert Kühmayer, Jozef Arpád Murmann and Alojz Stróbl, Alojz Rigele was part of a group of famous artists that influenced the art and architecture of the city of Bratislava. This older generation of sculptors born before the 1900s often represented historical and social themes. Rigele was an active member of the Pressburger Kunstverein group and the Bratislava Beautification Association. The Alchymist from approximately 1920 is considered to be among Rigele&#x27;s finest sculptures.

== Biography ==
Alojz Rigele was born in 1879 in Pressburg (today Bratislava). His early education was at the modelling studio of the Bratislava decorative sculptor Adolf Messmer. He started exhibiting his works at Bratislava exhibitions since 1899. He studied at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna from 1901 to 1908 under professor Jan Bitterlich and professor Edmund von Hellmer. As a winner of Péter Pázmány&#x27;s epitaph in 1907, Rigele got a 2-year study opportunity at Rome where he lived from 1908 to 1910. In 1911, Rigele settled in Bratislava.

He was a prolific author who took a large number of orders of varying scope, which resulted in the varying quality of his output. He created most of his works between 1897 and 1938. He received and declined numerous offers for professorship at universities in Prague and Budapest. Despite the arguable quality of some of his artworks, he never succeeded financially and he was not able to acquire his own professional studio. Alojz Rigele died in poverty in Bratislava in 1940.

Numerous statues survive in public spaces particularly in Bratislava, but also in over 50 villages and towns in Slovakia, Austria and Hungary. Many of Rigele&#x27;s statues and paintings are preserved at the Bratislava City Gallery, Slovak National Gallery and the Bratislava City Museum.

== Rigele&#x27;s studio ==
Rigele created his works in his rented apartment inside the Lanfranconi Palace at today&#x27;s Námestie Ľ. Štúra and in his studio inside a yard of a house on Štefánikova Street. The studio was located at that time at No. 27a; today it is located at No. 35 – 41 behind three residential buildings. The studio is a low, narrow wooden structure with one wall made of glass. It was built in the 1890s by local construction tycoon Karl Mahr. Štefánina Street was from the 1840s the main road connecting the Bratislava main railway station with the city center. It was a street of luxury houses, palaces and villas. Karl Mahr acquired a land lot at this street which was used as a construction yard during the construction of buildings in the area. The yard was the headquarters of the notable stonemason company MAHR, which was owned by the unmarried sister of Karl Mahr. The Mahrs invested heavily into World War I war bonds that became valueless after the lost war. They had to sell all their houses and continued to live there as tenants.

Alojz Rigele created most of his works inside this studio or outside, on the yard. Altogether, he used the studio for four decades and even long after his death in 1940 and the studio&#x27;s later nationalization, there were parts of unfinished artworks lying around together with rare building materials including a piece of marble from the destroyed equestrian statue of Maria Theresa which stood at the today&#x27;s Námestíe Ľ. Štúra. The studio is a Category 1A Cultural Monument of Bratislava under the name &quot;Ateliér firmy Mahr a Alojza Rigeleho&quot;.

<doc id="414154" wikidata="Q17084917" url="?curid=414154" title="Crotch">
<text>In humans, the crotch is the bottom of the pelvis (the region of the body where the legs join the torso) and is the part of the body that includes the groin and genitals.

==Etymology==
&quot;Crotch&quot; is derived from &quot;crutch&quot;; it was first used in 1539 to refer to a forked stick used as a farm implement. This region of the body is also described with other terms such as &quot;groin&quot; or the lower ventral area.

== In clothing ==
In clothing, the crotch is the area of trousers, shorts, leggings etc. where the legs join. The bottom of the crotch is an end of the inseam. The crotch-region on smaller garments such as underwear are sometimes referred to as the &quot;pouch&quot;. Loosely-fitted or bagginess in the crotch-region is sometimes associated with a lax, casual and easy-going approach to attires or garbs.

Clothing that is tight-fitting in the crotch produces an effect that is sometimes referred to by informal terms such as a &quot;man-bulge&quot;  or &quot;moose-knuckle&quot;  on men, and a &quot;camel toe&quot; on women, especially if the woman&#x27;s labia majora are conspicuous. Prolonged constrictive pressure of the crotch on the male genitals may increase the likelihood of detumescing.

== Scope ==
The semantic field of the term &quot;crotch&quot; is sometimes expanded to include objects which have shapes similar to that of the anatomical human crotch. This may include botanical structures such as the area where tree branches are joined together or mechanical structures which fork or branch or where ramification takes place. The term had also been expanded to include the joining together of asymmetrical surfaces in cue sports equipment or the corners of flat surfaces usually made of quarried slate.

== Depictions in artwork ==

The human crotch has been depicted in artwork. In Paleolithic art, forms called tectiforms or quadrilaterals have sometimes been interpreted to be &quot;quick visual guides, reminders to the imagination&quot; of the female crotch, and typically do not represent the crotch hairs.

Classical marble statues depict females without pubic hair; in contrast, statues of males &quot;show curly pubic hair&quot;.

For much of the history of European art – &quot;until the late seventeenth century&quot; – references to the female crotch were approached from above: &quot;Art usually expressed the sense of the vulva as a point at the bottom of the belly rather than as the meeting place at the top of the thighs.&quot;

Art therapists have noted &quot;a triangular or vaginal shaped area in drawings by rape/sexual abuse victims&quot;.

<doc id="414157" wikidata="Q1813246" url="?curid=414157" title="Catholic Church in Argentina">
<text>The Argentine Catholic Church, or Catholic Church in [[Argentina]], is part of the worldwide Catholic Church, under the spiritual leadership of the Pope, the Curia in Rome, and the Argentine Episcopal Conference.

According to the CIA World Factbook (July 2014), 92% of the country are nominally Catholic, but less than 20% practice their faith regularly (i.e., attend weekly Mass). Later studies in 2019 suggest that between 62.9% and 63.3% of Argentinians are Catholic. No study has yet determined whether Catholics with higher levels of traditional religious observance are more likely than those with lower levels to participate in any cultural Catholic activities such as participating in online conversations about Catholicism&#x27;s customs, beliefs, etc., sharing Catholic holidays with family, or engaging in political and social activism as an expression of Catholicism. In 2020, such a study was made of American Jews, comparing and contrasting nominally Jewish adherents with those who practice their faith weekly.

Today, the church in Argentina is divided into administrative territorial units called dioceses and archdioceses. Buenos Aires, for example, is a metropolitan archdiocese owing to its size and historical significance as the capital of the nation.

An archbishop of Buenos Aires, Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio (now Pope Francis), SJ, was elected as Pope on 13 March 2013 in the 2013 papal conclave. Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral, the seat of the archbishop, also houses the remains of General José de San Martín in a mausoleum.

There are eight Catholic universities in Argentina: Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina (Buenos Aires), the Universidad Católica de Córdoba, the Universidad Católica de La Plata, the Universidad Católica de Salta, the Universidad Católica de Santa Fe, the Universidad Católica de Cuyo, the Universidad Católica de las Misiones, and the Catholic University of Santiago del Estero.

==History==

===Colonial Era and Independence===

During the Spanish colonial period, the Catholic Church became the main provider of Christian presence and religious social services in the different Spanish viceroyalties in South America, including the territory that would later become the current Argentine Republic.

After the May Revolution in 1810 first, and then with the independence of Spain in 1816, there were disagreements within the national ruling elite about the degree of influence of the church in the country. Without wanting to offend Spain, the papacy condemned the revolutions sweeping South America in time and creating a contentious relationship with the budding Argentina Nation that will finally be resolved in 1966 with the concordat between the Argentine Republic and the Holy See.

=== Ecclesiastical reform of Rivadavia ===

Between 1820 and 1824, Martín Rodríguez governed, whose minister Bernardino Rivadavia promoted an ecclesiastical reform by modernizing a sector of society that had not changed since the time before the May Revolution. This reform included the suppression of tithes, the transfer to the State of some of the assets of the religious orders, such as those of the Sanctuary of Luján, of the Brotherhood of Charity, of the Hospital of Santa Catalina and others. 5 In opposition to the reform on March 19, 1823, the &quot;Revolution of the Apostolics&quot; broke out led by Gregorio García de Tagle in which illustrious citizens such as Domingo Achega, Mariano Benito Rolón, Ambrosio de Lezica (father) participated among others but failed after several hours of struggle.

The arbitrary and unilateral spoils of the Rivadavian administration together with the role of the Catholic Church in the genesis of Argentine nationality are the cause of the historical reparation that underlies the current support of Catholic worship in Argentina, regulated by Law 21.540 on the &quot;Assignment to certain dignitaries belonging to the Roman Apostolic Catholic Cult.&quot; 6

=== Relationship from the National Organization ===

In any case, it was established in the first Argentine Constitution, (unitary) promulgated in 1819 – in its article 1 -, in that of 1826 (also unitary) – in its article 3 – and then in the federal Constitution of 1853, in its article 2, – still in force with modifications -, which reserves a special place for the Catholic Church, the majority religion among the population.

During the wars for independence, the State confiscated many temple assets to support the armies. For this reason, after the fall of the tyranny of Juan Manuel de Rosas, in the battle of Caseros, when the Constitution of 1853 was drafted, this debt is recognized in the aforementioned article 2.

Church–state relations in the nineteenth century were characterized by a series of conflicts between the Argentine government and the church over the issues of compulsory secular education, civil marriage and the governmental appointment of religious authorities. Argentina and the Holy See broke diplomatic relations in the 1880s on these issues and it took almost 20 years to restore them.

=== First half of the 20th century ===

At the beginning of the twentieth century, Buenos Aires was the second largest Catholic city in the world after Paris. The XXXII International Eucharistic Congress of 1934 was held in Buenos Aires, Argentina between October 9 and 14, 1934 with the presence of Eugenio Pacelli, future Pope Pius XII. It was the first to be held in Latin America and the third in the Americas after those held in Montreal and Chicago.

On the same day that the martyr Hector Valdivielso Sáez – the first Argentine saint – gave his life on October 9, the International Eucharistic Congress of 1934 began that marked a revival of Argentine Catholicism, a milestone from which a new life of the Church in Argentina, the dioceses increased, vocations grew, new parishes were built, and the laity became aware of their importance in the Church. Because of the magnitude of the crowds that attended public events, never before seen, it was the most important mass event in the country to date and, for some historians, the largest mobilization that has occurred in Argentina to date. 7

Relations improved in the early twentieth century, with several conservative administrations working with the Holy See to lay the foundations for a mutually acceptable relationship, which involved, among other things, state permissiveness towards religious education in public schools.

===Mid-20th Century===

The government of the Infamous Decade, the subsequent dictatorship and the first eight years of the government of Juan Perón overthrew the continuity of the fluid relationship between the State and the Catholic Church. In 1954, President Perón broke off relations with the Catholic Church and began a confrontation with it. The Perón regime abolished non-working days for Catholic Holidays, legalized Divorce and Prostitution, prohibited religious displays in public places, and Creches were banned in Buenos Aires. On June 11, 1955, approximately 200 thousand people attended a Corpus Christi procession in Buenos Aires, despite it being illegal. The Peronist regime reacted by accusing the attendees of vandalism and burning the Flag of Argentina. The next day, Peronists attempted to set fire to Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral, but were prevented by members of Catholic Action and the UNES. During a Peronist rally in the Plaza de Mayo on June 16, the Plaza was bombed as a part of a failed coup attempt by Anti-Peronists, which killed more than 300 civilians. In response, Peronists destroyed several churches and hundreds of Anti-Peronists and Priests were arrested.

The 1960s served as a decade of significant change for the Catholic Church in Argentina. The severed relationship caused by the Peron dictatorship coincided with major political shifts in Latin America. Following the Second Vatican Council&#x27;s conclusion in 1965, the Catholic Church experienced a renewal of morals, with a greater focus on interaction in the social sphere. Increased interaction between the church and the poor living in slums/rural areas of Latin America created stronger connections between classes and political movements. Following the overthrow of Peron in 1955, many sectors of Argentinian society struggled to create and construct new projects. A widespread ban on the Peronist Party removed a majority of the population out of the political system. The ban created a power struggle amongst labor unionist groups, as well as economic and political groups. The struggle for power between groups was halted by a lack of long term legitimacy, resulting in political groups unable to enforce their ideas on others. Support for the Church and its civil power increased as a result.

In the military government of the post-Peron era, young people were led towards political involvement through working with the church. The radicalization of the Catholic Church as a result of the Second Vatican Council paved the way for increasing revolutionary thought, with the pressure of injustice and an incapable infrastructure being presented to the young people of society. In direct response to the council, the Movement of Priests for the Third World was created. With a focus on supporting work force conflicts, the priests outwardly supported socialist revolutionary beliefs from 1967 to 1976. Within this era of revolutionary growth, there became different ways of interpreting the future of the Catholic Church in response to the concern&#x27;s of state terrorism. Scholar Gustavo Morello has argued that the church fractured into 3 categories, each based on the relationship between the Catholic Church and the state. National Catholics held the belief that the church and the state were to be closely aligned, and that &quot;only a Catholic State could guarantee a Catholic society&quot;. Official Catholics understood the importance of the relationship between the state and the Church, however keeping most powers separate. Popular Catholics, which used their links of the past with the state in order to protect human lives in the present. Finally, a fourth form of Catholicism, one in which threats towards human lives were to be seen as a call for Catholics to stand in harm&#x27;s way.

The relations of the Catholic Church and the Argentine Government improved after the overthrow of Peron. In 1966, a Concordat between Argentina and the Holy See was signed that governs to today the relations between the two, and explicitly states that it is the Pope who exclusively controls the appointment of Bishops. The radicalization of both the Catholic Church and of Argentina&#x27;s politics resulted in violence by religiously motivated leftist groups. The growing violence and revolutionary thought in the public sphere was linked to the fracturing occurring within the church. Ideas of implementing concepts discussed at the Second Vatican Council faced backlash from those committed to the conservative, national-Catholicism of the pre-Peron Argentina.

Rise of Leftist Violence

The relationship between the church and the state have been characterized by conflicts with leftist guerrilla organizations, conflicts over human rights abuses, and economic injustices. During this period, Liberation theology became popular in the Church after the Second Vatican Council, which coincided with the rise of leftist armed groups, to which some priests and numerous lay Catholics were attached to.The clashing that occurred through political and theological changes led to the rise of a Christian militant group, the Montoneros. Beginning with the abduction of former president Pedro Aramburu on May 29, 1970, the Montoneros incited political violence, combined with the pressure coming form labor strikes and protests resulted in a loss of trust in the left. With the increase in political violence during the return of the Peronist regime (1973–1976), the influence of conservatives in the Church increased, and even more so after the 1976 coup d&#x27;état by the military, which gave way to a right wing military junta, which became infamous for the Dirty War.Over the course of the Dirty War, tens of thousands of Argentinians were abducted or went missing through these operations incorporated by the state, raising further concerns over the issue of human rights in the country. The rise in state-sanctioned violence had a direct impact on the growth of human rights activism, especially in organizations created by the public.

The positions adopted by the Church authorities during the Dirty War varied. Depending on each case, they went from the open support of some bishops and priests to the armed groups of the left; to the explicit support the junta and its actions. The vast majority of the clergy remained on the sidelines, either because they ignored the events produced, or because they chose not to get involved. A number of those who disappeared during the Dirty War were priests. The role of the church as human rights activists was received by the state as Marxist/Communists, especially because the poor were perceived as most likely to organize. Whilst political beliefs varied, the Liberation Theology movement in Argentina built itself out of long term injustices that had been ignored by the church. In the face of scrutiny or death, the religious commitment of the Catholics was the same commitment to the cause as the poor.

During its peak, the human rights activists in Argentina caught the attention of the United States, whose attention to activism surrounding foreign nations was significantly heightened by the Cold War and concerns of communism. The result came in 1977, in the form of the senate&#x27;s military aid authorization bill, which cut off all US military and commercial sales to Argentina. With a lack of foreign support, the military junta accepted a visit from the Inter-American Human Rights Commission (IAHRC) in 1978.

The first ever visit of a Pope to Argentina took place in 1982, after the end of the disastrous Falklands War. John Paul II had planned a pastoral visit to the United Kingdom, which was important for ecumenical relations with the Anglican Church, but he didn&#x27;t want to rebuff Argentine Catholics. He sent a letter to the Argentine people and carried out a brief visit to the country.

===Post-Junta===

With the return to democracy in 1983, there was a return to previous debates, including the situation of children born out of wedlock, marriage, and divorce. The controversy on these issues were especially significant during the administration of President Raúl Alfonsín.

In 1987, Pope John Paul II paid a visit to Argentina for a second time for the first World Youth Day in Buenos Aires, an initiative led by the Pope and Argentine Cardinal Eduardo Pironio.

During the administration of President Carlos Menem (1989–1999), the &quot;day of the unborn child&quot; that Menem himself promoted in support of the defense of the Unborn was declared on March 25. Menem was recognized by Pope John Paul II for his dedication to this cause. However, several prominent Bishops condemned Menem&#x27;s economic policies because they increased the poverty rate.

===21st Century===

Relations between church and state became bitter during the presidency of Nestor Carlos Kirchner. Relations with Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio (now Pope Francis), Archbishop of Buenos Aires, were very strained. Before which the government avoided participation in the traditional Te Deum prayer celebrations at the Buenos Aires Cathedral, including those corresponding to the anniversaries of the May Revolution.

Conflicts, such as the displacement of the Military Bishop Antonio Baseotto, who opposed the policies of the Minister of Health, Ginés González García who promoted the decriminalization of abortion and the distribution of condoms to young people; by viewing his appointment that was interpreted as incitement to violence. Communicators linked to the government, such as Horacio Verbitsky, disseminated notes and books dedicated to accusing many clerics of collaboration with human rights violations during the Dirty War.

Nestor Carlos Kirchner was succeeded in 2007 by his wife, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who identifies as Catholic. During her term, same-sex marriages became legal, which kept relations between the Government and the Church strained. The Catholic Church, together with Protestant denominations organized protests against the proposed law. Cardinal Bergoglio issued a statement to lawmakers who opposed the bill, calling the effort &quot;a movement by the father of lies to confuse and deceive the children of God.&quot; And during a meeting of the Argentine Episcopal Conference, in a rare political statement, he urged Catholics to oppose the politicians who supported the bill. However it was still legalized in Argentina regardless, becoming the first country in Latin America to do so. Despite these divergent points, President Kirchner expressed several times her opposition to the legalization of abortion during her two terms. Shortly after assuming her second term, the president reaffirmed this position in a meeting of more than 45 minutes that she held with the Episcopal Conference; and blocked debate in the Chamber of Deputies regarding it.

In 2013, Cardinal Bergoglio was elected Pope and this led to an improvement in relations between the Catholic Church and the government.
In 2023, the country was scored 4 out of 4 for religious freedom.

<doc id="414162" wikidata="Q1526321" url="?curid=414162" title="Refusal to serve in the Israel Defense Forces">
<text>Citizens of Israel have refused to serve in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) or have disobeyed orders on the grounds of pacifism, antimilitarism, religious philosophy, or political disagreement with Israeli policy such as its occupation of the West Bank. Conscientious objectors in Israel are known as &quot;sarvanim&quot; (in Hebrew ) which is sometimes translated as &quot;refuseniks&quot;, or &quot;mishtamtim&quot; (evaders, dodgers).

== Aspects ==
===Causes===
Some distinguish between refusal to serve in the military because of a pacifist worldview that rejects any manifestation of violence and encompasses a refusal to submit to compulsory military service in any form, and partial refusal to serve, such as the Courage to Refuse group who &quot;do their reserve duty wherever and whenever they are summoned, but refuse to serve in the occupied territories.&quot; The diverse range of opinions regarding the refusal to serve is the reason why there is no single umbrella organization that encompasses all groups of refusers. While most instances of refusal to serve have historically been found among left-leaning Israelis, there is a rapidly expanding willingness among right-wing soldiers to refuse orders to evict Jews from settlements in the West Bank (and formerly in the Gaza Strip).

===Religious exemption===
Since the founding of the State of Israel in 1948, Haredi Jews have refused to serve in the Israeli military for religious reasons. Typically, they study Torah in Yeshivas, and as such are legally exempt from military service. Also refusing any Israeli military service are people affiliated with various Hasidic anti-Zionist groups (most notably Satmar), the Brisk Yeshivas, and the Neturei Karta. Most of these groups are followers of the Edah HaCharedis. Haredi Jews who avoid military service yet are only part-time yeshiva students, have received criticism from within the Orthodox community.

===Draft evasion among celebrities===
Some Israeli celebrities have evaded military service national service to further their careers. A 2007 incident that garnered international headlines focused on revelations in the press that Israeli &quot;Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue&quot; cover model Bar Refaeli had married a family friend in 2004 and divorced him soon after in order to avoid military service. Refaeli received widespread criticism, including from the Israeli Forum for the Promotion of Equal Share, to which she responded, &quot;I really wanted to serve in the IDF, but I don&#x27;t regret not enlisting, because it paid off big time. That&#x27;s just the way it is, celebrities have other needs. I hope my case has influenced the army.&quot; In a compromise to avoid potential boycotts of companies Refaeli works with, she agreed to visit injured IDF soldiers on visits to Israel and encourage enlistment in the army. The incident made headlines again in October 2009 when fellow Israeli model Esti Ginzburg criticized Refaeli in an interview with Israeli newspaper &quot;Yedioth Ahronoth&quot;, reigniting arguments over the ease with which conscription can be dodged.

===Response to draft evasion===
Almost all the political factions in Israel have condemned refusal to serve on ideological grounds, using terms such as &quot;dangerous&quot; and &quot;undemocratic&quot;. The conscientious objectors, or refuseniks as they call themselves, found support within left-wing and the Arab parties, Hadash, Balad, Raam and parts of Meretz (Zehava Galon, Roman Bronfman and Shulamit Aloni). The Israeli Labor Party and other Meretz members have condemned the refuseniks and said that although their protests against the occupation are justified and understandable, the means they are taking to manifest it are wrong. Some major left-wing politicians expressed the fear that left-oriented refusal to serve in the territories will lend legitimacy to right-oriented refusal to remove settlements. Right wing politicians have claimed that the refuseniks&#x27; actions are helping the enemies of Israel in their anti-Israeli incitement. Some have even accused the refuseniks of treason during wartime. This viewpoint was given some support when the book &quot;The Seventh War&quot;, by Avi Yisacharov and Amos Harel was published in 2004; it contains extensive interviews with Hamas leaders, at least one of whom explicitly stated that the actions of the commandos&#x27; and pilots&#x27; letters encouraged to promote and continue the use of suicide bombers.

The Israeli High Court of Justice ruled in 2002 that refusal to serve was legal on the grounds of unqualified pacifism, but &quot;selective refusal&quot; which accepted some duties and not others was illegal. The court said that allowing selective refusal would &quot;weaken the ties that bind us as a nation&quot;. The court also said that the refusal to serve in the territories is selective refusal and not conscientious objection.

From 1998 to 2000, 9.5% of applicants who filed for an exemption from service for conscientious reasons were granted it.

On January 4, 2004, a military tribunal imposed one-year prison terms on five young activists who refused to enlist in the IDF. The court accepted that the five acted in accordance with their conscience but &quot;ruled that they did not refuse to serve as individuals, but rather as a group, with the explicit goal of bringing about a change in Israeli policy in the territories. As such, the court ruled, their action strayed from the norms of classic conscientious objection into the realm of civil disobedience&quot; (&quot;Haaretz&quot;).

== History ==
===Origins===
In Mandatory Palestine during World War II, when many military-age Jews from the Yishuv were joining the British military, a few conscientious objectors refused, and wrote to the headquarters of War Resisters&#x27; International in London about the social pressure they faced. A Palestine branch of War Resisters&#x27; International was founded in 1946 by one such conscientious objector, David Engel, who in 1943 had been expelled from Kfar Ruppin for refusing to enlist in the British Army. He reported that his group initially had about 40 members. In 1948, the year of Israel&#x27;s declaration of independence, another member of the group, Joseph Abileah, was the first conscientious objector to be put on trial before a military court for refusing to serve in the IDF. He was excused from service in the army on the grounds of ill health, which according to him was a face-saving measure. A 1954 report in Haaretz judged the size of the group to be about 100. The group&#x27;s greatest failure was to not have conscientious objection recognised in law. In general, persons who made their objections known before being called up were treated more leniently than those to objected after receiving their call-up notice. Members of the group held a variety of political opinions beside their common pacifism; while some were anti-Zionist most were not.
Although Israel has mandatory conscription, some Israelis do not serve in the military. Israeli Arabs are not drafted, though they may enlist, and increasing numbers serve voluntarily including at very senior level. Haredi Jews were exempt, so long as they did study in yeshivas (up to a maximum of 62,500 individuals), based on an arrangement worked out with David Ben-Gurion in 1948 and the Tal Law, though small numbers volunteer to serve in the IDF, especially in the Netzah Yehuda Battalion. The exemption lapsed on August 1, 2012, after being struck down by the Israeli Supreme Court in April 2012. Orthodox women can avoid service on the basis of their religion upon filing certain paperwork. After becoming officially exempt, religious women may choose to do national service work instead, although this is not compulsory. Many people who are &quot;unfit&quot; or &quot;unqualified&quot;, either mentally or physically, are also exempt. Military service can often be postponed for further education—either college or university, or technical studies. Finally, a number of people refuse to serve because of pacifist views, because they believe the IDF is not an army of defense, or refuse certain orders based on their disagreement with government policy.

In February 2004, Israeli Chief of Personnel Major-General Gil Regev told a Knesset committee that the number of soldiers refusing to serve in the territories had dramatically decreased in 2003 despite the increase in the number of high-profile refusals. He said that eighteen reserve soldiers and eight officers had been imprisoned for refusal in 2003 compared to 100 reservists and 29 officers in 2002, a decrease of 80%. Members of the refusers&#x27; organization &quot;Yesh Gvul&quot; claimed in reply that actually 76 people, including eleven officers, had been jailed for refusal in 2003. They also said that 79 soldiers and eighteen officers had added their names to the &quot;Courage to Refuse&quot; letter in 2003, and that the number of high-school &quot;refuseniks&quot; had risen to 500.

The first well-known instance of an individual refusing to serve in the IDF occurred in 1954 when Amnon Zichroni, a lawyer, asked to be released from military service as a pacifist. Initially, then Minister of Defense Pinhas Lavon refused to release Zichroni, though he was eventually discharged from the army reserves.

===&quot;Shministim&quot; movement===
On April 28, 1970, a group of high school seniors about to be drafted sent a letter to Prime Minister Golda Meir expressing their reservation about the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, the War of Attrition and the government&#x27;s failure to take steps to avoid conflict. In 1987, a new group was formed, also made up of high school students intent on refusing to serve in the Occupied Territories. They gave themselves the name that the press used to dub the previous effort – &#x27;Shministim&#x27; (&quot;). In 2001, a high-school refusers movement – also called &quot;Shministim&quot; followed in their stead. Over 3,000 Israeli high school students are currently members of Shministim. . A smaller number of them have also signed a public letter in which they state their intent to refuse any service in the army. Such a behaviour has usually resulted in repeated jail sentences of several weeks. One of the most prominent &quot;Shiministim&quot; that went to jail is Omer Goldman. Her case received special attention since her father used to be one of the highest ranking Mossad officers.

On December 18, 2008, a worldwide campaign was launched in order to request the freedom of &quot;Shministim&quot;, including the delivery of more than forty thousand letters, to Israeli embassies, appealing for her cause.

===&quot;Yesh Gvul&quot; movement===
&quot;Yesh Gvul&quot; (Hebrew: , can be translated as &quot;there is a limit&quot; or &quot;the border exists&quot;) is a movement founded in 1982 at the outbreak of the Lebanon War by reservists who refused to serve in Lebanon. A petition, delivered to Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Defense Minister Ariel Sharon was signed by 3,000 reservists, some of whom were court martialed and served time in military prison for refusing to obey orders. Currently, it sees its main role as &quot;backing soldiers who refuse duties of a repressive or aggressive nature.&quot; It also engages in human rights activities, such as petitioning British courts to issue arrest warrants for IDF officers accused of human rights abuses and war crimes.

In the Adam Keller Court Martial in April–May 1988, Reserve Corporal Adam Keller was charged with insubordination and spreading propaganda harmful to military discipline. While on active military duty he had written on 117 tanks and other military vehicles graffiti with the text: &quot;Soldiers of the IDF, refuse to be occupiers and oppressors, refuse to serve in the occupied territories!&quot; as well as placing on electricity pylons in the military camp where he was serving—and on inside doors of the stalls in the officers&#x27; toilet—stickers with the slogans &quot;Down with the occupation!&quot;. Keller was sentenced to three months imprisonment although the maximum penalty could have been six years, three for each of the charges. Keller was an active member of Yesh Gvul, but declared that he had operated on his own. For its part, the movement did not take responsibility for his act, but did provide his wife with the monetary support given to the families of refusers.

===&quot;Courage to Refuse&quot; group===
In January 2002, 51 reserve soldiers and officers signed a &quot;Combat Troops&#x27; Letter&quot; or &quot;Combatants&#x27; Letter&quot; in which they declared their refusal &quot;to fight beyond the 1967 borders in order to dominate, expel, starve and humiliate an entire people.&quot; They established the group, Ometz LeSarev, which distinguishes itself by using conspicuously Zionist discourse: &quot;Refusal to serve in the Territories is Zionism.&quot; 633 combatants from all units of the IDF and from all sectors of the Israeli society have since signed the letter.

===Pilots&#x27; letter incident===
&quot;The pilots&#x27; letter,&quot; published on September 24, 2003, was signed by 27 reserve and active duty pilots. One of the signatories was the famous pilot Brigadier General (res.) Yiftah Spector. The letter was precipitated by the targeted killing of Salah Shehade, leader of Hamas&#x27;s militant wing, who was killed, along with 14 others, by a one-ton bomb dropped on his residential building. Pilots decried the large number of civilian casualties caused by Israel&#x27;s targeted killings as violating the military&#x27;s ethics code. In their letter, the pilots stated:We, veteran and active pilots alike, who served and still serve the state of Israel for long weeks every year, are opposed to carrying out attack orders that are illegal and immoral of the type the state of Israel has been conducting in the territories. We, who were raised to love the state of Israel and contribute to the Zionist enterprise, refuse to take part in Air Force attacks on civilian population centers. We, for whom the Israel Defense Forces and the Air Force are an inalienable part of ourselves, refuse to continue to harm innocent civilians. These actions are illegal and immoral, and are a direct result of the ongoing occupation which is corrupting all of Israeli society. Perpetuation of the occupation is fatally harming the security of the state of Israel and its moral strength.The signatories clarified that they do not reject military service in the IDF, only targeted killings of individuals, declaring: &quot;We ... shall continue to serve in the Israel Defense Forces and the Air Force for every mission in defense of the state of Israel.&quot;

In response, the Chief of Staff announced that the pilots would be grounded and will no longer be allowed to train cadets in the country&#x27;s flight school. In response to their letter, hundreds of IAF pilots signed a petition denouncing the pilots&#x27; letter and their refusal to serve. Because of the harsh response, several of the pilots who originally signed the letter reneged and removed their signatures; after more than 30 signed, four later recanted. One, an El Al pilot, was threatened with dismissal and another lost his civilian job.

===Commandos&#x27; letter incident===
This letter, dated December 2003, was signed by 13 reservists of Sayeret Matkal, an elite commando unit, serving in the West Bank and Gaza Strip (nine commandos in Sayeret Matkal, two soldiers who had been removed from reserve duty because of prior refusals to serve there, and two additional combatant soldiers). Their letter, addressed to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, stated:We shall no longer lend a hand in the occupation of the territories. We shall no longer take part in the deprivation of basic human rights from millions of Palestinians. We shall no longer serve as a shield in the crusade of the settlements. We shall no longer corrupt our moral character in missions of oppression. We shall no longer deny our responsibility as soldiers of the Israeli DEFENSE force.

===Mateh Chomat Magen group===
There are some Israeli rabbis, former generals and public figures who call on soldiers to refuse orders to dismantle Israeli settlements and remove their residents. One of those who call soldiers to refuse removal order is Uri Elitzur, a publicist and former civil servant. Eliztur claims that settlers-removal order is an illegal order, and therefore soldiers must refuse to obey it. He used the Hebrew term (literally, a clearly illegal order), which is a judicial term for an order that a soldier &quot;must&quot; refuse, coined in relation to the Kafr Qasim massacre. He used a Yossi Sarid (a left-wing politician from Meretz) quotation that an order to transfer Palestinians should be resisted by any means, as a legitimation to a total and even semi-violent resistance against transfer of settlers. In June 2004, MKs Effi Eitam and Aryeh Eldad (National Union) initiated a law bill called &quot;Unity of the Military Law&quot;. The law says that only Israeli police (including Border Police) officers could engage in the removal of Jewish settlements, and soldiers could not. In 2005, as a reaction to the Israel&#x27;s unilateral disengagement plan, a group called &quot;Mateh Chomat Magen&quot; (the name referring to Operation Defensive Shield) published a letter with 10,000 signatures of soldiers who signed a petition saying that they would refuse to uproot and remove Israeli settlements.

=== September 2014 Unit 8200 letter ===
In what &quot;The New York Times&quot; called, &quot;the first public collective refusal by intelligence officers rather than combat troops&quot; to serve, on September 12, 43 veteran reserve army mid-ranking officers and soldiers (33 soldiers and 10 officers, including a major and two captains, mostly in their late 20s and 30s) in the IDF&#x27;s top intelligence electronic surveillance corps, Unit 8200, Israel&#x27;s equivalent to the NSA, published a letter in Israel&#x27;s most widely read newspaper, &quot;Yedioth Ahronoth&quot;, directed to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the IDF Chief of Staff Benny Gantz, Moshe Ya&#x27;alon and Aviv Kochavi, the head of Military Intelligence, in which they registered their refusal to participate, on the grounds of conscience, in any action designed to &quot;harm the Palestinian population in the West Bank.&quot; It took roughly a year to gather all of the signatures, and its publication was delayed by the war in Gaza until hostilities ceased in order not to be seen as attacking the army in wartime. According to the highest-ranking signatory, many other members of Unit 8200 support their stand, but did not add their names for fear of reactions and the personal price their involvement would exact. Ten of the 43 belonged to the &quot;circle of control&quot; in the unit.

The 43 decried the use of espionage to set up airstrikes that have inflicted casualties among civilians. The letter, originally written before the recent 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict, was initially reported to be unrelated to it, but does mention &quot;the collective punishment of residents in Gaza&quot;, that war being, according to one of the group, &quot;just another chapter in this cycle of violence&quot;, and calls on the Israeli public to speak up against injustices. While the incidents they allude to have no relation to Operation Protective Edge, in which none participated, several avoided service during the 2014 war in Gaza by refusing to answer a call to do reserve duty, employing a variety of excuses. In the light of that war, the refuseniks said they would refuse to enlist if called upon to serve in the reserve, and none had served during the July–August Gaza war.

In their view, espionage that probed for information of sexual preferences or health problems that might prove useful in turning people into informants for Israel, invaded the privacy of a people under occupation, sought to exercise control over innocent Palestinian civilians, turn people into collaborators and stir divisiveness and dissension among Palestinians in the West Bank. One of the undersigned said that, while affirming their commitment to continue gathering intelligence on enemy states, they found themselves morally obliged not engage in intelligence gathering whose &quot;main objective is to maintain the military rule in the West Bank&quot;. The soldiers also alleged that cases existed where IDF intelligence hindered just trials for defendants, from whom evidence in the prosecution&#x27;s hands was withheld, in military courts. According to the undersigned trainees for the unit are led to believe that there is no such thing as a clearly illegal order within Unit 8200.

Shortly after, 200 other reservists signed a counter protest stating:We are veterans of Unit 8200, soldiers and reserve soldiers, past and present, who wish to express shock, disgust and total renouncement of the letter written by our fellow soldiers, who chose political refusal over our unit...We regret that our friends make cynical use of politics in their legal and moral duty to serve in the reserve unit, which in our eyes constitutes the highest honor, and seek [instead] to undermine the activities and achievements in the unit&#x27;s defense of the country and its people.Defense Minister Moshe Ya&#x27;alon criticized the letter by saying &quot;I know Unit 8200 from my time as head of Military Intelligence and know the massive extent which their efforts play in Israel&#x27;s security. They soldiers and officers there are doing God&#x27;s work, night and day. 8200 preserves Israel&#x27;s existence. The attempt to harm it and its work, through calls to refuse to report for duty, based on claims that are incongruent with the unit&#x27;s ways and the values of its soldiers, is a base and distasteful attempt to aid the hateful and dishonest anti-legitimization campaign being led around the world against Israel and the IDF.&quot; Opposition leader and head of the Labor Party Isaac Herzog, who served as a major in the 8200 unit, also hailed its work and said he was opposed to, and repulsed by, so-called &quot;conscientious objectors.&quot; He said that &quot;this unit and its activities are essential not just in time of war, but especially in times of peace,&quot; adding that he believed the way in which the members went about voicing their objections was harmful and that Israeli citizens would ultimately pay the price. Knesset Speaker Yuli Edelstein said that the signatories had &quot;done a great service to haters of Israel. This is a clear political statement against the IDF and published just as harsh criticisms with no basis or understanding of our situation are being thrown at us.&quot; Labor MK Shelly Yachimovich called them &quot;cowards.&quot;

One refusnik said his decision arose from a gradual realization that he was engaged in the kind of work that usually makes people shudder and is associated with what intelligence services do in non-democratic regimes. A captain in the group stated that a good deal of what the IDF is not about &#x27;defense&#x27;, but consists in military rule over another people in the Occupied Palestinian territories. A further witness said that Palestinians lacked &#x27;legal protections from harassment, extortion and injury.&#x27; One testified that &quot;any information that might enable extortion of an individual is considered relevant information&quot;. A captain said his outlook was changed after viewing The Lives of Others, dealing with the way the East German Stasi unit pried into the private lives of citizens. Another said a turning point occurred when he watched at the unit&#x27;s headquarters as a figure in an orchard was blown up in an airstrike, and, when the smoke cleared they could see his mother running to the body of what was evidently then just a small boy. Another officer spoke of an incident at the outset of Operation Cast Lead where 89 young policeman at their graduation ceremony were killed in a bomb strike, which he complained to his superior was both &quot;morally unsound and problematic&quot;, time being lost killing police on parade instead of attacking rocket sites and arsenals. His remark was passed on, but no reply received. The witness also mentioned the targeted assassination of Nizar Rayan, which killed 18 members of his family, and successive attempts to kill Hamas leaders. In the operational room disappointment was expressed not at civilians being killed arbitrarily, but that they had missed their targets. The source further asserted that Israel let people requiring medical treatment die unless they were forthcoming about a relative who was on the wanted list. Another incident related concerns an operation where it was surmised that a person on their wanted list appeared to be standing by a weapons warehouse in Gaza, the time and location suggested it would be him, and he was assassinated. The victim turned out to be a child. Another witness said that booty taken during arrest operations was stacked in a storeroom, photos, flags, weapon parts, books, Qurans, jewellery, and soldiers were told they could take whatever they liked out of this Palestinian memorabilia, the idea being to &#x27;poison the students&#x27;.

Testimonies concerning specific incidents were also listed in the letter, which, IDF spokesman Michael Lerner said, would be examined. One particular allegation, made by a captain, was that during the Al-Aqsa Intifada, in 2003, the IDF routinely bombed buildings at night as a response to terrorist attacks. On the occasion of the Neve Shaanan Street bombing by Islamic Jihad, a harsher response was decided on, involving the bombing of a Fatah building, though Fatah was known to be unconnected to the terroristic incident. In addition that Fatah target had no military function, but was a welfare centre where paychecks were doled out. Breaking precedent with the past, the operation was designed to hit the building, not when it was empty, but when people were inside to ensure that deaths would occur. Signalling that people were inside the building would give a green light for executing the bombing. In what became known as the Lieutenant A. Affair, a lieutenant of the unit refused on principle to give the green light for the attack. The media misrepresented the proposed action as a targeted killing. The officer was described within the unit as &#x27;confused&#x27;—he was kicked out of his job, and given administrative duties and the message was that there was no such thing as an illegal order in that unit. One of the 43 said he had access to the inquiry, and that it was faked, making out that the lieutenant had been ordered to ensure the targeted building was empty, which, he stated, was the opposite of the truth. Another interviewee contrasted the huge outcry caused by the 14 collateral civilian casualties in the targeted assassination of Salah Shehade in 2002 with the insouciance that met the continual bombing of buildings, with hundreds of innocent deaths, during the summer conflict with Gaza. One refusnik&#x27;s father had suffered at the hands of Argentina&#x27;s military junta under its Dirty War and drew a comparison, which he said was only partial, between intelligence gathering for the army and its consequences there, and what Palestinians can face under Israeli military rule. A number of signatories expressed regret for their collaboration in providing input for airstrikes prior to the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict that, while targeting Hamas military commanders, also killed innocent bystanders. Working in Unit 8200 is a &#x27;coveted pipeline&#x27; to career advancement in Israeli&#x27;s high-technology industries.

The gesture has been interpreted as &quot;an unprecedented rebuke to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s security policies.&quot; Three signatories clarified that the letter was not just related to the recent Israel–Gaza conflict, but referred to the &#x27;normal&#x27; circumstances of Israel&#x27;s occupation. The letter, according to Elior Levy, has tapped into wider concerns regarding the ethics of state surveillance, in the wake of Edward Snowden&#x27;s NSA leaks.

The IDF dismissed the letter as a &quot;publicity stunt by a small fringe&quot;, and a defense spokesman stated that those who work for Unit 8200 personnel were required to observe ethical standards &quot;without rival in the intelligence community in Israel or the world&quot;, and that the group&#x27;s going public when internal mechanisms existed to handle complaints undermined the seriousness of their assertions. All 43 are expected to be dishonorably discharged from the IDF.

Former head of 8200, Brigadier General Hanan Gefen, commented:
If I was the unit&#x27;s commander I would have terminated their [protesters] service, court-marshalled them, and ask for severe punishment. They used confidential information, which they privy to during their service, to promote their political agenda.
An IDF spokesperson said that the 43 would be severely disciplined and that there was no place for refusal in the IDF.

Over 200 other reservists in the Unit denounced the letter as shameful, and that they had revealed matters taking place within a top secret unit for political reasons. Everything there is done, they aver, in conformity with international and IDF ethics.

In an op-ed, Gideon Levy praised the &#x27;courage&#x27; and ethics of an elite group which, he claimed, when interviewed on radio and television, was dismissed by commentators in unison with descriptive language ranging from &quot;trippy,&quot; &quot;scandalous,&quot; &quot;negligible,&quot; to &quot;spoiled brats,&quot; &quot;politicos&quot; and &quot;lefties&quot;.

=== 2023 &quot;Youth Against Dictatorship&quot; letter ===
In September 2023, over 200 Israeli youth released an open letter entitled Youth Against Dictatorship announcing that they would refuse to serve.

On December 26, 2023, Israeli teen Tal Mitnick was sentenced to 30 days in jail for refusing the draft, refusing to participate in the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, which he condemned as &quot;a revenge campaign... not only against Hamas, but against all Palestinian people.&quot; Mitnick&#x27;s comments about his actions were shared by Mesarvot, which is one of several support groups for conscientious objectors to the IDF or refuseniks. In February 2024, Sofia Orr was also jailed for refusing to serve in the IDF, explaining that she had made the decision when she was 15 because &quot;if I enlisted, I would be taking part in and normalizing a decades-long cycle of violence&quot;. Another war refuser, Ariel Davidod, declared his refused to serve in October 2023 but was not jailed.

=== November 2024 Ultra-Orthodox arrest warrants ===
In mid November 2024 it was announced that Israeli military officials had issued 1,126 arrest warrants for ultra-Orthodox Jewish conscripts who had not responded to drafting orders. Brigadier General Shay Tayeb who announced the warrants also stated that those who continued to not cooperate would be summed immediately or declared a draft dodger and banned from foreign travel and risk of arrest. The warrants come after a June 2024 ruling by the Israeli Supreme Court stating that the government must enlist draft-aged ultra-Orthodox Jews into the military, who had been previously exempt in order to study the Torah. The ruling had caused officials in the ultra-Orthodox Shas party to urge potential conscripts in July 2024 to ignore any call-ups from the IDF and protests which at least one resulted in protestors attacking both law enforcement and the vehicle of Minister Yitzhak Goldknopf.

<text>The Brooklyn Dodgers were an American football team that played in the National Football League from 1930 to 1943, and in 1944 as the Brooklyn Tigers. The team played its home games at Ebbets Field of the baseball National League&#x27;s team, the Brooklyn Dodgers. In 1945, because of financial difficulties and the increasing scarcity of major league–level players because of the war-time defense requirements at the height of World War II, the team was merged with the Boston Yanks and were known as the Yanks for that season.

This old NFL franchise was not related to the earlier (second incarnation) American Football League II with a franchise that played as the Brooklyn Tigers for the first half of the 1936 season before moving to Rochester, New York and playing as the Rochester Tigers. Another NFL team that played in the Brooklyn borough was the Brooklyn Lions (which became the Brooklyn Horsemen after merging with a team from an earlier first incarnation AFL of the same name) in 1926.

In 1946, co-owner and partner Dan Topping (1912–1974) pulled the Tigers team out of the old NFL and placed it in the newly established rival professional league – the All-America Football Conference, which shortly lasted until 1949, until three teams from the AAFC merged with and entered a reorganized NFL in 1950.

==History==
===Early years===
The team began play in 1930 after two Brooklyn businessmen bought the Dayton Triangles for $2,500 and moved the NFL franchise to Ebbets Field. These two individuals were Bill Dwyer, a past owner of the New York Americans and Pittsburgh Pirates of the National Hockey League, and Jack Depler, a player-coach for the NFL&#x27;s Orange Tornadoes. Dwyer and Depler then renamed the Triangles the Brooklyn Dodgers, borrowing the former name of the Brooklyn Robins, Brooklyn&#x27;s major league baseball team, who had been named the Brooklyn Trolley Dodgers in 1911 and 1912. The Brooklyn baseball team would again adopt the name Brooklyn Dodgers in 1932.
While operating under the Triangles franchise, the Dodgers were essentially a new team. The roster was dominated by players from the 1929 Tornadoes, with most of the 1929 Triangles roster riding the bench. Many former Triangles were unable to relocate their families during the Great Depression. The Dodgers finished fourth in the NFL with a 7–4–1 record, a massive improvement upon the Triangles&#x27; disastrous final seasons in Dayton. The high point of their season consisted of a 7–6 upset over the New York Giants at the end of November. The Dodgers star back was Jack McBride, a former Giant. He led the league in scoring with a total of 56 points in 1930. The 1931 season saw the Dodgers post a 2–12 record. Once the season ended, Benny Friedman was brought in as the team&#x27;s new player-coach.

The 1932 season started off promising with wins over the Staten Island Stapletons and the new Boston Braves (later renamed the Redskins). The team soon hit a five-game losing streak. The streak ended with a 3–0 win over the Chicago Cardinals, followed by four more losses. They ended the season 3–9.

===Post-Dwyer era===

At the end of the 1932 season, Bill Dwyer had enough of professional football. His three years with the Dodgers had cost him an estimated $30,000. The Dodgers were then purchased by two former New York Giants players, Chris Cagle and John Simms Kelly for $25,000. Cap McEwen, a successful college football coach, was then brought in to replace Friedman, who would continue to play tailback for the Dodgers through half of the upcoming season. The 1933 season also saw the NFL split into two divisions. The Dodgers were placed in the Eastern Division and had a chance for first place, by posting a 5–2–1 record. A 10–0 loss to the Giants in front of 28,000 Brooklyn fans at Ebbets Field ended that chance in November.

The following season, Dan Topping bought Chris Cagle&#x27;s half of the team. Topping would later become an owner and president of baseball&#x27;s New York Yankees. Meanwhile, Cagle continued to play in the Brooklyn backfield. Brooklyn signed Ralph Kercheval, who later became one of the great NFL kickers. He returned to play for Brooklyn for the next seven seasons and scored every Dodgers point in their last six games as they finished with a 4–7 record.

In 1935, Paul Schissler. the former coach of the Chicago Cardinals, took over as the Dodgers coach. Stars Cagle, Friedman, and Kelly all retired. As a result, the Dodgers line-up consisted of 15 rookies. The 1935 season did show the team posting a 5–6–1 record and second place in the Eastern Division. Over the next four seasons, the Dodgers placed either in the fourth or third place in the Eastern standings. Several of the star players to wear a Dodgers uniform during this time included Harold &quot;Bunker&quot; Hill, Bob Wilson, and Bill Lee. The roster also included future Hall of Famers, Red Badgro and Ace Parker. Both men had played professional baseball in the majors. Badgro played for the St. Louis Browns before playing in the NFL for the Giants and Yankees. Meanwhile, Parker played under Connie Mack, while as a member of the Philadelphia Athletics. He is best known for hitting a home run his first time at bat as a pinch hitter, becoming the first player in American League history to do so. Another future Hall of Famer joined the team in 1938, Frank Kinard. Kinard would play for Brooklyn for the rest of the franchise&#x27;s history.

The Dodgers made NFL history on October 22, 1939. That day, at Ebbets Field, the Dodgers played the Philadelphia Eagles in the first NFL game shown on television. The Dodgers won the game 23–14.

===Jock Sutherland era===
In 1940, the Dodgers chose Jock Sutherland as their team&#x27;s next coach. Sutherland brought to Brooklyn the Single-wing formation, which he had used at Lafayette College and Pitt. Under Sutherland, Brooklyn finished in second place in the Eastern standings behind the Redskins. Meanwhile, Parker was awarded the Joseph Carr Trophy as the league&#x27;s Official Most Valuable Player. During this time, Dodger staples Mike Gussie All American from West Virginia University, Dick Cassiano and Ben Kish, who played for Sutherland at Pitt; George Cafego and Banks McFadden were signed by the team.
In 1941, the team again landed in second place of the Eastern Division, behind only the Giants. Dodger Clarence &quot;Pug&quot; Manders won the NFL rushing title that season with 486 yards. His title still represents the smallest number of yards carried to ever win this title. Warren Alfson and Merlyn Condit joined the team that season. Sutherland&#x27;s 1940 and 1941 campaigns would be the most successful during the franchise&#x27;s history.

===Decline===

Beginning in 1942, the team went into a steep decline, as World War II caused a shortage of players and fans. Coach Sutherland, along with Ace Parker and several other players left the team to join the military and Mike Getto took over as coach. With the core of the team gone, the Dodgers sank to a 3–8–0 record. A year later, they won only two games. In 1944, Dan Topping chose Tom Gallery to run the team while he was serving in the armed forces.

In 1944, the team was renamed the Tigers, but suffered an 0–10 regular season record. In a desperate attempt for survival, the team merged with the Boston Yanks for the 1945 season. The merged team played four home games in Boston and one in New York, but fans from neither city cared as they finished with a 3–6–1 record. The merger occurred on April 10, 1945 after the 1945 NFL draft.

==Topping, the Dodgers and the AAFC==

In December 1945, Topping announced his intentions to accept the All-America Football Conference&#x27;s New York franchise. In response to this defection, the NFL immediately cancelled his NFL team franchise, and all of its players were assigned to Boston.

Meanwhile, the AAFC planted another team in Brooklyn called the Dodgers, and the two teams would merge in 1949. Topping&#x27;s Yankees employed several former Dodgers players in 1946 and 1947 such as Parker, Kinard and Manders, and the Yankees reached the AAFC Championship Game in both years (being beaten by the Cleveland Browns in both games).

==Indirect ties to the Indianapolis Colts==
The sequence of events begun by the demise of the Brooklyn Dodgers NFL team eventually resulted in the creation of what is now the Indianapolis Colts.

The Boston Yanks moved to New York as the Bulldogs in 1949. After the 1949 season the NFL added three teams from the AAFC. The AAFC Yankees players were split between the Giants and Bulldogs. The Bulldogs renamed themselves the New York Yanks in the same season.

After the 1951 season, Yanks owner Ted Collins sold the franchise back to the league. The NFL then sold it to a new owner, Giles Miller, who moved the team to Dallas and renamed it the Dallas Texans. Miller returned his franchise to the league in the middle of the 1952 season, and the NFL operated it as a traveling team before folding it at the end of the season. In 1953, the NFL granted an expansion franchise to a Baltimore-based group and awarded it the remains of the Texans organization. The team, named the Colts, relocated to Indianapolis in 1984. The NFL does not consider the Colts a continuation of the Dodgers.

==First-round draft selections==
==Pro Football Hall of Famers==

<doc id="414164" wikidata="Q368296" url="?curid=414164" title="List of census metropolitan areas and agglomerations in Canada">
<text>This is a list of the census metropolitan areas and agglomerations in Canada by population, using data from the 2021 Canadian census and the 2016 Canadian census. Each entry is identified as a census metropolitan area (CMA) or a census agglomeration (CA) as defined by Statistics Canada.

A city&#x27;s metropolitan area in colloquial or administrative terms may be different from its CMA as defined by Statistics Canada, resulting in differing populations. Such is the case with the Greater Toronto Area, where its metro population is notably higher than its CMA population due to its inclusion of the neighbouring Oshawa CMA to the east and the Burlington portion of the neighbouring Hamilton CMA to the west.

In 2021, 27,465,137 people (71.9% of Canada&#x27;s population) lived in a CMA, while 4,596,279 (12.0%) lived in a CA.

== Recent growth ==
Between 2016 and 2021, the five CMAs with the highest percentage growth were located in British Columbia and Southern Ontario. The five CMAs with the lowest percentage growth were in Quebec, Alberta, Northern Ontario and Newfoundland and Labrador. There were no CMAs for which negative growth was recorded in the 2021 census. The five CAs that grew the fastest were in British Columbia, Southern Ontario, and Alberta, while the five CAs whose population declined the most were in New Brunswick, Saskatchewan, Northern British Columbia, Manitoba and Newfoundland and Labrador. 

Between 2011 and 2016, the six fastest-growing CMAs by percentage growth were located in Western Canada, with Alberta&#x27;s two CMAs, Calgary and Edmonton, leading the country. Saskatoon, Regina, and Lethbridge rounded out the top five in the country and each grew by at least 10%. Of the remaining 30 CMAs, population growth was recorded in all but two of them. Those that experienced population decline were Brantford and Saint John. Ten of the fifteen fastest-growing CAs in Canada between the two most recent censuses were located in Alberta. The other five were located in British Columbia with two, and Manitoba, Ontario and Yukon each with one. 

Between 2006 and 2011, twenty-four CAs experienced population decline. The fifteen CAs that experienced the greatest population decline were located in British Columbia (two), Manitoba (one), New Brunswick (one), Nova Scotia (three), Ontario (four) and Quebec (four). Okotoks experienced the greatest increase while Thompson experienced the greatest decline.

== List ==

Canada had 41 CMAs and 111 CAs at the 2021 census. The number of CMAs increased from 35 in 2016 with the promotion of the Nanaimo, Kamloops, Chilliwack, Fredericton, Drummondville and Red Deer CAs. Overall, between promotion to CMA, absorption, and dissolution, the number of CAs decreased by seven. Amos was reinstated as a CA and Ladysmith, Trail and Essa were added as new CAs. The Carleton Place and Arnprior CAs were dissolved as they were added to the Ottawa–Gatineau CMA, the Leamington CA was dissolved as it was added to the Windsor CMA, and the Cold Lake and Bay Roberts CAs were dissolved as their urban population decreased below 10,000. 2016 rankings in the chart below are based on 2021 boundaries and exclude the five CAs dissolved in 2021 but include the four new/reinstated CAs.

Canada had 35 CMAs and 117 CAs at the 2016 census. The number of CMAs increased from 33 in 2011 with the promotion of the Belleville and Lethbridge CAs. The number of CAs increased from 113 through the creation of eight new CAs – Arnprior, Carleton Place, Gander, Nelson, Sainte-Marie, Wasaga Beach, Weyburn and Winkler – the demotion of two CAs – Amos and Temiskaming Shores – and the promotion of Belleville and Lethbridge to CMAs.

<doc id="414166" wikidata="Q639207" url="?curid=414166" title="Jim Gibbons (American politician)">
<text>James Arthur Gibbons (born December 16, 1944) is an American attorney, aviator, geologist, hydrologist and politician who was the 28th Governor of Nevada from 2007 to 2011. A member of the Republican Party, he previously served as the U.S. representative for Nevada&#x27;s 2nd congressional district from 1997 to 2006.

Following his service in the United States Air Force, Gibbons served as vice commander of the Nevada National Guard from 1990 to 1996. He unsuccessfully ran for governor of Nevada in 1994, losing to incumbent Bob Miller. Two years later he successfully ran for the House of Representatives, where he represented Nevada&#x27;s 2nd congressional district from 1997 to 2006. Gibbons again ran for governor in 2006, defeating Democratic nominee Dina Titus in the election.

Gibbons&#x27; term as governor was dominated by the Great Recession, which hit Nevada particularly hard. In response he cut funding for state services by 5%, but this ended up causing a budget crisis. Nevada experienced an economic slowdown, steep budget cuts, and high taxes during Gibbons&#x27;s governorship. Afterwards he ranked among the worst governors in the United States. Gibbons attempted to run for reelection in 2010, losing the Republican nomination to federal judge Brian Sandoval, who later won the election.

==Early life and education==
Gibbons was born in Sparks, Nevada. He was raised in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Gibbons interrupted his studies at the University of Nevada, Reno, during the Vietnam War to serve in the United States Air Force (1967–1971). During his time in college he was a member of Sigma Nu fraternity. He also attended Southwestern Law School in Los Angeles, California and the University of Southern California for post-graduate studies. A graduate of the U.S. Air Force Air Command and Staff College and the Air War College, he joined the Nevada Air National Guard in 1975 and served as its vice commander from 1990 to 1996, participating in the first Gulf War. During his military career, Gibbons earned nineteen service medals, including the Legion of Merit and Distinguished Flying Cross. In civilian life, he has worked as a lawyer in private practice, an airline pilot for both Western Airlines and Delta Air Lines, and as a hydrologist and a geologist.

==Career==
Gibbons represented District 23, later renumbered as District 25 (Washoe County), in the Nevada Assembly from 1988 to 1994 (with a short intermission due to military service in 1991). Gibbons won his first election with approximately 64% of the vote and thereafter faced no opposition due to the heavy Republican lean of the district. During this time he and his Nevada Air National Guard unit was called to active service in the U.S. Air Force for the Gulf War. During this period, he served as a pilot and Flight Leader flying the RF-4C Phantom II reconnaissance aircraft. During the conflict, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for extraordinary achievement while participating in a mission in which he flew his unarmed aircraft on a reconnaissance mission to acquire politically sensitive imagery of enemy targets in Kuwait.

===1994 gubernatorial election===

While working as a pilot for Delta Air Lines and serving in the Nevada Assembly, Gibbons ran for Nevada governor in 1994. As the Republican nominee, he lost to Democratic incumbent Bob Miller, having received 156,875 votes to Miller&#x27;s 200,026.

===United States Congress===
In 1996, Barbara Vucanovich, the only representative that the 2nd District had known since Nevada was split into districts in 1983, announced her retirement. Gibbons won the Republican primary—the real contest in this heavily Republican district—and breezed to victory in November. He was reelected four times with no substantive opposition, including a 1998 run in which he faced no major-party opposition.

Gibbons served as vice chairman of the House Resources Committee, and he was a member of the Armed Services Committee, the Homeland Security Committee and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. His long-time congressional Chief of Staff, Michael Dayton, was replaced in 2002 by legislative director Robert Uithoven. Uithoven served on Gibbons&#x27; staff for many years, including four years as chief of staff. He later served as campaign manager for Gibbons&#x27; successful 2006 Gubernatorial campaign. Uithoven was not given a gubernatorial position. His predecessor, Michael Dayton, was named as the governor&#x27;s top aide.

===2006 gubernatorial election===

Gibbons announced in late 2004 that he would not run for a sixth term in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2006, instead opting to run for Governor of Nevada. Gibbons won the August 15, 2006, Republican primary handily, defeating state senator Bob Beers and Lieutenant Governor Lorraine Hunt.

====Employing illegal immigrant housekeeper/nanny====
As Gibbons was campaigning for governor in October 2006, it was brought to light that more than ten years earlier, his wife Dawn had employed Martha Patricia Pastor Sandoval, a then-illegal immigrant from Peru, as a housekeeper and babysitter. Since the Nannygate matter of 1993, politicians have been deeply concerned about the impact of such revelations on their careers.

Dawn, who had become a member of the Nevada Assembly in 1998, denied the allegations in 2006, claiming that Sandoval had merely been a friend who had helped out around the house and was given clothing and household goods, but was not an employee. An employment contract between Dawn Gibbons and Sandoval, however, appeared to disprove that assertion, as it clearly laid out the terms and conditions of Sandoval&#x27;s hiring. Documents filed during Sandoval&#x27;s 1988 application for working papers also contradicted earlier statements by Dawn Gibbons that the family had not known that the woman was in the United States illegally.

Sandoval stated that she was employed from approximately 1987 to 1993, four years before Gibbons left for Washington in 1997, after his 1996 election as a Congressman and five years before Dawn Gibbons became a state legislator. Sandoval also stated that she was asked to hide in the basement and refrain from answering doors at certain times in order to ensure that her illegal status did not become public knowledge and jeopardize Gibbons&#x27; political career.

In 1995, Dawn Gibbons filed a police complaint against Sandoval, alleging that she was attempting to extort money by threatening to go to the media with a story involving her illegal employment. Jim and Dawn Gibbons did not pursue the matter further.

In response to the 2006 revelations, Jim Gibbons&#x27; campaign issued a statement accusing Democratic candidate Dina Titus of fomenting the controversy to distract from the real issues of the race, but did not issue a denial of Sandoval&#x27;s claims.

====Sexual assault civil suit====
In October 2006, near the conclusion of his successful campaign for governor, a woman accused Gibbons of attempted sexual assault in a parking garage. Gibbons claimed he was helping her to her car. They both admitted to drinking alcohol at McCormick and Schmick&#x27;s restaurant in Las Vegas.

In the initial aftermath of the event, Clark County Sheriff Bill Young, a Republican and long time supporter and donor of Gibbons&#x27; gubernatorial campaign, cited lack of evidence in the case and refused to bring evidence of the attack to the District Attorney. The accuser did not initially want to pursue pressing charges, saying she just wanted &quot;to be left alone.&quot; But the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department was forced to open the case after inquiries by the Las Vegas media, the &quot;Las Vegas Review-Journal&quot; and the &quot;Las Vegas Sun&quot; which also drew controversy by releasing the woman&#x27;s name and thrust her into the public eye.

She later said she was being pressured to not talk to the police about the incident by people close to Gibbons. In fact, the Gibbons campaign hired a private investigator to talk to the woman shortly after the incident occurred.

The evidence was given to Clark County District Attorney David Roger, a Republican, who had also donated to the Gibbons campaign. Criminal charges were never filed in the case.

Gibbons&#x27; gubernatorial campaign manager, Robert Uithoven, speculated in an e-mail to Gibbons&#x27; supporters that Dina Titus, Gibbons&#x27; opponent, hired the woman to entice Gibbons. Titus retorted that to do this she would have had to control where Gibbons went, who he was with, and even the weather (Gibbons claimed he was helping the woman to her car in part because of the weather).

By 2009, the alleged victim had filed a civil suit against Jim Gibbons, specifically alleging battery, false imprisonment and second-degree kidnapping as well as deceit about the episode. The lawsuit was settled in July 2013 for $50,000.

====Federal bribery investigation====
On November 1, 2006, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; published a story stating that Gibbons had earmarked several millions of dollars to a company owned by Warren Trepp, the former chief bond trader for Michael Milken at the height of his junk bond trading period at Drexel Burnham Lambert. The &quot;Journal&quot; also said that Gibbons had directed additional funds to a pre-existing government contract with Trepp&#x27;s startup company. The report noted that Trepp had paid for a $10,000 cruise for Gibbons and his wife, which Gibbons failed to report in his U.S. House of Representatives ethics filings, and $100,000 in campaign contributions. Dennis L. Montgomery, a former Trepp business partner, claimed that Gibbons was also given gambling chipsconvertible into cashand cash directly.

On February 15, 2007, the &quot;Journal&quot; reported that Gibbons was under federal investigation for allegedly accepting unreported gifts and/or payments from Trepp in exchange for official acts while he served in Congress (1997–2007).

According to reports, on March 22, 2005, days before Trepp and his wife left for the Caribbean cruise with Gibbons and his family, Jalé Trepp, Warren&#x27;s wife, sent a reminder to her husband. It said, &quot;Please don&#x27;t forget to bring the money you promised Jim and Dawn (Gibbons).&quot; Minutes later, Trepp responded, &quot;Don&#x27;t you ever send this kind of message to me! Erase this message from your computer right now!&quot;

The ethics probe into Gibbons expanded to include another company that paid Gibbons&#x27; wife Dawn $35,000 in consulting fees in 2004, while Gibbons helped the company receive a no-bid federal contract.

The U.S. Attorney for Nevada at time of the investigation was Republican Daniel Bogden, who had been appointed by Republican President George W. Bush in 2001. Bogdan was one of seven federal prosecutors dismissed by the Bush in December 2006 without explanation.

====2006 gubernatorial election results====
In the general election he faced Democratic nominee Dina Titus, who was the Minority Leader in the Nevada State Senate. Gibbons received 278,984 votes to Titus&#x27;s 255,675. Titus won Clark County, Nevada&#x27;s most populous, but Gibbons won every other county. Gibbons called Titus &quot;an admirable opponent&quot;, although Titus declined to echo his sentiments, saying &quot;We disagree on basic policies, and neither one of us is going to change our minds for the other&quot;.

Gibbons resigned his House seat on New Year&#x27;s Eve, and was sworn in as governor just after midnight on New Year&#x27;s Day.

===2010 gubernatorial election===

Gibbons was the subject of numerous controversies, both professional and personal, causing speculation that he would not seek re-election for a second term as governor. However, Gibbons did file as a candidate for re-election in March 2010. On June 9, 2010, he lost his bid for nomination in the Republican primary to former federal judge Brian Sandoval—who went on to win the general election and become the 29th governor of Nevada.

==Gubernatorial initiatives==
===Support for the Yucca Mountain nuclear repository===
In July 2007, Gibbons approved a plan to let the U.S. Department of Energy use the state&#x27;s water to explore the planned Yucca Mountain nuclear waste site. According to the &quot;Las Vegas Sun&quot;, &quot;Neither Gibbons nor his aides have offered public explanations for the governor&#x27;s perplexing moves. In particular, they have not explained how giving federal authorities more time to build a case for Yucca Mountain or appointing a Yucca advocate to the nuclear projects board could possibly be interpreted as being in line with the state&#x27;s opposition to the plan.&quot; Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) said &quot;this amounts to surrendering in Nevada&#x27;s decades-long fight against the project&quot;. Rep. Shelley Berkley (D-NV) said &quot;This demonstrates to me that he either doesn&#x27;t know what he&#x27;s doing or he&#x27;s reversed his position.&quot;

During an April 23, 2010, debate for the Republican gubernatorial primary, Gibbons further confused his actual stance on Yucca Mountain by taking positions both favoring and opposing the federal waste dump over a two-minute period of time. &quot;Gibbons then said he believed nuclear waste can be transported safely and that &#x27;I can tell you, you can store it safely.&#x27;&quot; However, when questioned by the moderator, Gibbons said he supported shutting down the Yucca Mountain facility.

===Attempt for health care reimbursement from Mexico===
In August 2007, Gibbons unsuccessfully attempted to obtain reimbursement from the Mexican government for the health care expenses of Mexican nationals.

===State budget===

In October 2007, Gibbons proposed cutting funding for state services by 5% and ordered state agencies to submit lists of the services to be cut. Among the state agencies that were ordered to cut their budgets were the Nevada System of Higher Education, Nevada Department of Taxation, child welfare agencies and the juvenile justice agency. Gibbons expected an 80 million dollar cut to come directly from the Health and Human services agency alone. Most of these agencies refused to submit revised budgets to Governor Gibbons, citing already &quot;threadbare&quot; budgets. The Nevada Department of Taxation closed the Elko, Nevada tax office in June 2010 in response to the requested cuts.

On November 21, 2007, Gibbons revised his proposal upward for cutting state budgets. Nevada agencies were then told to plan for 8% cuts.

In 2008, Gibbons suggested that the Nevada legislature cut the state budget for elementary, secondary and higher education by 14%., Jim Rogers, Nevada Chancellor for Education, said of the budget cuts, &quot;We&#x27;re talking about something that is going to cripple us financially and competitively. The effects will be felt on our economy for the next 50 to 100 years.&quot;. The Nevada Policy Research Institute criticized the governor&#x27;s office for the budget, when the administration claimed that the state was facing a crisis, despite a 1% decrease in state spending.

==Criticism while governor==
===Undeclared donations===
Gibbons set up a legal defense fund just before the November, 2006 gubernatorial election to help pay for legal expenses incurred after a woman accused him of attempted sexual assault. Gibbons neither reported the legal defense fund to the appropriate U.S. House of Representatives committee (even though he was a sitting congressman at the time and was required by House rules to do so), nor did he report donations to his legal defense fund as contributions to his gubernatorial campaign, citing the money was for &quot;personal use&quot; and not for &quot;political purposes&quot;.

In January 2008, it was reported that Gibbons raised $256,000 for his legal defense fund during 2007, including a $61,000 personal loan Gibbons gave to his own fund, as well as $10,000 from the Palms Casino Resort, and $40,000 from various companies connected to Las Vegas Sands Corporation Chief Executive Sheldon Adelson. The defense fund has spent money to defend Gibbons in cases which include:
* Investigations into the allegations that Gibbons secured defense contracts for his friend Warren Trepp in exchange for gifts and money during his time in Congress, 1997–2006.
* A nepotism scandal regarding Sierra Nevada Corporation&#x27;s hire of Nevada first lady Dawn Gibbons as a consultant. Sierra Nevada paid Dawn Gibbons $35,000 at the same time Jim Gibbons helped the company get a no-bid federal contract.
* Gibbons&#x27; alleged attempted sexual assault of a Las Vegas woman in 2006.
* Questions about Gibbons&#x27; employment of an illegal immigrant as a nanny.

===Interference with an ongoing investigation===
On August 3, 2007, the &quot;Las Vegas Review-Journal&quot; printed the following:

A newly available document states that Gov. Jim Gibbons &quot;has admitted&quot; that he urged federal authorities to pursue criminal action against a software developer whose business dispute with a friend of Gibbons has prompted a federal investigation. The statement is made in a legal motion filed last year, but kept secret until Tuesday, when it was unsealed at a judge&#x27;s order.

The United States investigated Dennis Montgomery, the subject of the complaint by Governor Gibbons, was convicted and sent to Federal Prison for fraud.

===Lamoille land deal===
In 2007, Gibbons and his wife Dawn purchased of land in the ranch country near Lamoille, Nevada, approximately 20 miles South of Elko, Nevada. The land belonged to former Nevada Judge Jerry Carr Whitehead. The Elko County Assessor said he felt pressure from the governor, governor&#x27;s lawyer and a member of the Nevada Tax Commission to lower the tax liability. Under state law, such an agricultural tax break goes only to legitimate farm and ranch operations, and must generate at least $5,000 a year in income. If such a land is developed by million-dollar homes, property taxes would go up. &quot;To say I was put in an awkward position I think is an understatement&quot;, Joe Aguirre, a Republican, told The Associated Press in 2008. The opinion page of the &quot;Las Vegas Review-Journal&quot; said on the allegations that the deal might constitute fraud. Aguirre later admitted that his previous statements were made up on the &quot;Las Vegas Sun&quot; saying that he wasn&#x27;t pressured into Gibbons tax break by Gibbons himself. The land deal was given to Gibbons himself after he finalized the divorce from his wife.

===Dedication to office===
While the state faced an economic slowdown and steep budget cuts, Gibbons faced criticism from officials for spending less time at his office. The &quot;Las Vegas Sun&quot; reviewed Gibbons&#x27; attendance and discovered that he was only in his Capitol office five days in August 2008 and never for a full eight hours. In September, he was in his office a total of seven days.

In an interview with &quot;Las Vegas Sun&quot; reporters, Gibbons said &quot;I never knew this job had a time frame on it that requires me to be sitting behind a desk at a certain hour.&quot; He also said that he works about 60 hours a week for the state. Previous Nevada governors were also interviewed and they said that they felt it was necessary that they spent most of their time in the office.

Gibbons&#x27; dedication to his office was called into question again six months later. On April 2, 2009, while appearing before a legislative panel to promote his renewable energy bill, Gibbons pulled out his cellphone and began texting. News stories used this incident to revisit the 860 messages he sent to his alleged paramour, and a 37-second video of him introducing himself to the panel, with a 17-second break in order to send the text message and refocus on the hearing was posted on YouTube.

Polling conducted in June 2008 indicated an all-time low 10% approval rating, with 59% disapproving by the &quot;Las Vegas Review-Journal&quot;.

===Broken tax pledge===
Prior to running for Governor of Nevada, Gibbons signed the Taxpayer Protection Pledge (tax pledge) that is promoted at the national level by Americans for Tax Reform and at the state level by Citizen Outreach PAC—whose CEO is Chuck Muth. On at least three separate occasions, Americans for Tax Reform and/or Muth took Gibbons to task for breaking the tax pledge. Each time, in addition to the actual violation of the pledge, they had to correct the record about Gibbons&#x27; &quot;misinformation&quot;, &quot;fibs&quot;, &quot;falsehoods&quot; and &quot;doublespeak&quot;.

Muth even went as far to say &quot;the non-stop parsing and telling of falsehoods about breaking the Pledge are worse than breaking the Pledge itself&quot;.

===Ethics group named Gibbons one of America&#x27;s worst governors===
In its April 2010 report, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), a left-of-center organization, named Gibbons one of 11 &quot;worst governors&quot; in the United States because of various ethics issues throughout Gibbons term as governor and his time in Congress. Some of Gibbons&#x27; ethics lapses cited by CREW include:

*Violated campaign finance law by accepting illegal corporate donations
*Overlooked ethical lapses of his appointee
*Endangered his state&#x27;s economy by threatening to reject federal stimulus funds.
*Has been investigated for his conduct as a member of Congress

==Beliefs and ideologies==
===Civil liberties===
*Voted YES on Constitutionally defining marriage as one-man-one-woman. (Jul 2006)
*Voted YES on constitutional amendment prohibiting flag desecration. (Jun 2003)
*Rated 7% by the ACLU, indicating what the group considers an &quot;anti-civil liberties&quot; voting record. (Dec 2002)
*Voted YES on making the PATRIOT Act permanent. (Dec 2005)

===Education===
====As governor====
In January 2007, Gibbons asked Nevada lawmakers to approve his budget that cut the percentage of education funding in Nevada to increase the percentage for public safety and human services programs.

In 2008, Gibbons suggested that the Nevada legislature cut the state general fund budget for elementary, secondary and higher education by 14% (this does not include federal or local revenues, or funds for construction or teacher pensions). Jim Rogers, former attorney, Nevada System of Higher Education interim chancellor, founder of the Intermountain West Communications Company and station owner of NBC affiliate KVBC (now KSNV), said of the budget cuts, &quot;We&#x27;re talking about something that is going to cripple us financially and competitively. The effects will be felt on our economy for the next 50 to 100 years.&quot;.

====As representative====
*Rated 10% by the NEA, indicating what the group considers &quot;anti-public education spending&quot; votes.
*Voted YES on allowing prayer in public schools during the War on Terror.
*Voted YES on letting public schools display the words &quot;God Bless America&quot;.
*Supports a Constitutional Amendment for prayer in public schools.
*Gibbons supports No Child Left Behind.

===Taxes===
====As governor====
Gibbons pledged during his 1994 campaign for governor to not impose new taxes on businesses or individuals in Nevada. Gibbons broke his tax pledge on several occasions. The state&#x27;s Business Tax on employer&#x27;s payrolls which was initiated in 1992 was increased under Gibbon&#x27;s term and renamed the &quot;Modified Business Tax&quot;. Various mandatory fees and licenses administered by the Nevada Department of Taxation were also significantly increased under Gibbon&#x27;s term. Most particularly was the State of Nevada&#x27;s yearly business license fee. This license fee was doubled from $100.00 to $200.00. Due to the additional tax burden of the increased Modified Business Tax on Nevada&#x27;s small businesses during a downward business cycle, this tax was readjusted to a lesser rate by the 2011 Nevada legislative session during the leadership of Governor Brian Sandoval who later broke his promises on not raising fees and taxes in 2015.

It was also discovered during the 2011 Nevada Legislative hearings that the Nevada Department of Taxation&#x27;s director, Dino DiCianno, never had the Tax Department under Gibbon&#x27;s leadership conduct Net Proceeds of Minerals (NPM) tax audits of mining operations within Nevada. DiCianno&#x27;s claim was that the Tax Department did not have qualified auditors capable of performing NPM audits. During Gibbon&#x27;s term market prices of precious minerals were at historical and significant high levels. The market selling price of Gold was in the $1,300 to $1,500+ per ounce range during Gibbon&#x27;s term. Gibbons was also a geologist and lawyer. 
During Gibbons term Nevada lead North America in Gold and Silver production. Also Nevada was ranked No. 3 in the world for Gold production. After Mr. DiCianno&#x27;s testimony to the Nevada legislature that no NPM audits were conducted while Gibbon&#x27;s was governor he resigned the following day. Governor Sandoval latter appointed William Chissel, a CPA with an auditing background as the replacement director of the Nevada Tax Department.

In the release of the Nevada&#x27;s Department of Taxation&#x27;s annual report in January 2012 which represented the fiscal year of July 1, 2010 through June 30, 2011, it was presented that the audit penetration rate (percentage of Nevada taxpayers audited of the total population of registered Nevada businesses) was the lowest amount in 6 years. The Tax Department during this 6-year period in the years 2006 and 2007, made a significant investment in new tax administration and audit software along with employee training to provide increased efficiency and audit performance. Accenture Consulting Services formerly a unit of Arthur Anderson &amp; Co. was selected to design and implement the tax administration software. Revenue Solutions Inc. of Boston, Massachusetts was selected as a subcontractor by Accenture to design and implement the tax auditing software system.

Approximately $40,000,000.00 was invested in new tax administration and audit software. The results of this investment after implementation of this system as shown in Tax Department&#x27;s annual reports (2008, 2009, 2010) have been abysmal.

During the first full year of leadership under the new director William Chissel, the Tax Department was fraught with turmoil and discontent. Chissel exited the director&#x27;s position and was replaced by a former deputy attorney general assigned to the department, Christopher G. Nielsen. Nielsen assumed the executive director&#x27;s duties on July 1, 2012. Mr. Nielsen was previously a deputy director of the Tax Department and was also an acting director after the termination of Dino DiCianno. Nielsen was in the position of acting director for several months prior to the appointment of William Chissel as executive director.

====As congressman====
* Voted YES on replacing illegal export tax breaks with $140B in new breaks. (Jun 2004)
* Voted YES on Bankruptcy Overhaul requiring partial debt repayment. (Mar 2001)
* Voted YES on Tax cut package of $958 B over 10 years. (May 2001)
* Voted YES on eliminating the federal estate tax. (Apr 2001)
* Voted YES on eliminating the marriage penalty. (Jul 2000)
* Rated 67% by NTU, indicating Satisfactory on tax votes. (Dec 2003)

==Electoral history==



==Personal life==

He married Dawn Gibbons in 1985; they have a son, born in 1987. Dawn Gibbons did not move to Washington to live with her husband while he served in Congress, saying she preferred to raise their son in Nevada. She herself was elected to the Nevada State Assembly in 1998, two years after Jim Gibbons was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. On May 2, 2008, Gibbons filed for divorce, citing grounds of incompatibility stemming from an undisclosed event in Reno, Nevada and requesting the court to determine whether Gibbons or his wife would live at the governor&#x27;s mansion.

In April 2009, Gibbons was living in Reno; his wife, Dawn, remained in the governor&#x27;s mansion in Carson City. An 1866 state law requires that governor must &quot;keep his office and reside at the seat of government&quot;. A spokesman for Gibbons described the move by the governor back to the couple&#x27;s Reno home, which they had owned since 1989, as a temporary situation and said there was no violation of the law.

In January 2010, the couple negotiated and completed an out-of-court divorce agreement. The divorce was finalized on July 21, 2010.
