<text>The government of Czechoslovakia under Marxism–Leninism was in theory a dictatorship of the proletariat. In practice, it was a one-party dictatorship run by the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, the KSC.

In the 1970s and 1980s the government structure was based on the amended 1960 Constitution of Czechoslovakia, which defined the country as the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. The Constitutional Act on the Czechoslovak Federation (1968) transformed the country into a federal state and stipulated the creation of two constituent republics, with separate government structures for the Czech Socialist Republic, located in Prague, and the Slovak Socialist Republic, situated in Bratislava. These republic governments shared responsibility with the federal government in areas such as planning, finance, currency, price control, agriculture and food, transportation, labor, wages, social policy, and the media. The central government, located in Prague, had exclusive jurisdiction over foreign policy, international relations, defense, federal stockpiles, federal legislation and administration, and the federal judicial system.

Government institutions in Czechoslovakia performed legislative, executive, and judicial functions. The Constitution clearly defined the responsibilities for making and implementing policy held by each branch of government. In reality, however, all decisions of state were made by the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. Government bodies existed purely, to administer the party program.

==Legislative branch ==
The highest legislative institution was the Federal Assembly, which Chapter 3 of the 1960 Constitution recognized as &quot;the supreme organ of state power and the sole statewide legislative body.&quot; The Federal Assembly was divided into two equal chambers, the Chamber of the People and the Chamber of the Nations. The Chamber of the People reflected a system of proportional representation: in 1986 it included 134 deputies from the Czech Socialist Republic and 66 deputies from the Slovak Socialist Republic. The Chamber of Nations had 150 members, 75 from each republic. Deputies were selected through popular elections and served five year terms of office; all 350 served concurrently.

After an election each chamber met to select its own presidium consisting of three to six members. Together, the chambers elected the forty-member Presidium of the Federal Assembly, which served as the legislative authority when the assembly was not in session. A joint session of the Federal Assembly selected its chairman and vice chairman. Alois Indra served as chairman from 1971 to 1989.

The Federal Assembly met in regular session at least twice a year, in the spring and fall. Legislation presented to the assembly at these sessions had to be approved by both chambers and in some cases requires a majority vote by both the Czech and the Slovak deputies in the Chamber of the Nations. Constitutionally, the Federal Assembly had exclusive jurisdiction in all matters of foreign policy, fundamental matters of domestic policy, the economic plan, and supervision of the executive branch of government. In practice, as was the case in all other Communist countries, its function was largely confined to rubber-stamping decisions already made by the KSC. Laws in Czechoslovakia were decided at the highest level of the KSC. They were then presented to the Federal Assembly for approval, which almost always came unanimously.

== Executive branch ==

The executive branch of government consisted of the president, the prime minister, a number of deputy prime ministers, and the federal ministers.

According to the 1960 Constitution, the president was elected by the Federal Assembly to a five-year term of office. In practice, the president was first selected by the KSC leadership and then &quot;officially&quot; voted into office by the Federal Assembly. As head of state, the president represented the nation in diplomatic affairs, received and appointed envoys, convened the Federal Assembly, and signed laws into force. He was commander in chief of the armed forces and was empowered to appoint or remove the premier, other members of the executive, and other high civilian and military officials. There was no vice president; rather, the Constitution provided that if the presidential office became vacant, the premier would be entrusted with the president&#x27;s duties until the Federal Assembly elects a new president.

The prime minister, the deputy prime ministers (numbering ten in 1987), and the federal cabinet ministers were collectively termed &quot;the government,&quot; which is constitutionally defined as &quot;the supreme executive organ of state power.&quot; All were chosen by the Central Committee of the KSC and formally appointed by the president. If both chambers of the Federal Assembly voted to censure any or all members of the government, the president was obliged to remove those members.

The premier, deputy premiers, and ministers collectively formed the Presidium of the Government of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. This Presidium supervised and controlled the activities of the federal ministries, commissions, and other departments. These Presidium functions appeared to correspond to the purpose of the government as stated in the Constitution, which was to ensure the implementation of laws enacted in the Federal Assembly and to coordinate, direct, and control activities in the federal ministries and other federal offices.

Federal ministers were important administrators, but they lacked the political weight of their counterparts in most non-communist countries. The number of ministries and the division of responsibilities among them have varied over time. In August 1986 there were thirteen federal ministries: agriculture and food; communication; electrotechnical industry; finance; foreign affairs; foreign trade; fuels and power; general engineering; interior; labor and social affairs; metallurgy and heavy engineering; national defense; and transportation. In addition, five individuals held positions that granted them ministerial status. These included the minister-chairmen of the Federal Price Office and the People&#x27;s Surveillance Commission, the chairman of the State Planning Commission, and the minister-deputy chairmen of the State Planning Commission and the State Commission for Research and Development and Investment Planning. These ministerial and ministerial-level positions within the government paralleled similar organs within the KSC, where policy was actually formed before it was enacted by federal government officials.

== Judicial branch ==

The highest judicial organ at the federal level was the Supreme Court of Czechoslovakia. Supreme Court judges were elected by the Federal Assembly to serve ten-year terms of office. The Federal Assembly also selected a chairman and vice chairman of the Supreme Court. If the chairman was from the Czech Socialist Republic, the vice chairman must have been from the Slovak Socialist Republic, and vice versa. The two republics must have been represented by an equal number of Supreme Court judges. Petitions for breach of law against decisions of the republic supreme courts were heard in the Supreme Court at the federal level. In addition to serving as the nation&#x27;s final court of appeals, the Supreme Court of Czechoslovakia examined the legality of decisions of the federal government and, in general, ensured the uniform interpretation of the laws. It also heard requests for recognition of foreign judgments in Czechoslovakia. The decisions of the Supreme Court emanate from &quot;benches&quot;, which comprised the Supreme Court chairman and selected professional judges. The Supreme Court also acted as the final court of appeal in military cases, although below the Supreme Court level military cases are handled in military courts, which were distinct from civil courts.

Below the Supreme Court of Czechoslovakia were the Supreme Court of the Czech Socialist Republic and the Supreme Court of the Slovak Socialist Republic. Below the supreme court of each republic were regional and district courts:
*District courts (one in each administrative district) were the courts of general civil jurisdiction and limited criminal jurisdiction and are presided over by one professional judge and two lay judges (there were no juries in the Czechoslovak judicial system).
*Regional courts (one in each administrative kraj) are located in the capitals of each of Czechoslovakia&#x27;s ten kraje and in Prague. They functioned as appellate courts and also had jurisdiction over trials in serious criminal cases where imprisonment exceeding five years may be imposed.
Regional and district professional judges were chosen by the Czech National Council and the Slovak National Council; lay judges were chosen by district national committees. The Supreme Court of the Czech Socialist Republic and the Supreme Court of the Slovak Socialist Republic serve as appellate courts for their respective regional courts and also heard petitions for breach of law against decisions by the lower courts. The supreme courts of the two republics decided in panels of three professional judges.

Another powerful arm of the judiciary was the Office of the Prosecutor. The general prosecutor, a federal officer, was appointed and removed by the president. In addition to the federal office, an Office of the Prosecutor existed for each republic. The republic office was administered by the republic Ministry of Justice. Prosecutors were responsible for supervising the observance of laws and legal regulations by public bodies and individual citizens. The Office of the Prosecutor was responsible for prosecuting both criminal and civil cases. Prosecutors might recommend modification or repeal of laws, and they had the right to summon citizens to appear before them.

==Lower levels==
=== Republic levels ===
The administrative units of Czechoslovakia&#x27;s two republics were, in each instance, a unicameral legislative body called the national council, an executive branch known as the government, and a judiciary consisting of a supreme court and an office of the prosecutor. Like its corresponding federal government unit, the Federal Assembly, the national council was described as the highest organ of state power in the republic, whereas the government was the &quot;supreme executive authority.&quot; The 1968 constitutional amendments that created the two republican or, &quot;national,&quot; governmental units initiated a truly federal system of government, which flourished briefly. Since that time, revisions of and deviations from the 1968 amendments have made the two national governments clearly subordinate to the federal governmental structure in Prague. This was apparent both in legislation, such as a 1971 law that authorized the federal government to interfere with and invalidate republican government initiatives, and in the interlocking responsibilities of certain officials within the two levels of government. For example, the premier of each republic was a deputy premier in the federal government, and the chairman of each national council was a member of the Presidium of the Federal Assembly.

Because of the numerical superiority of the Czech population, the Czech National Council had 200 representatives and the Slovak National Council only 150. Except for the difference in the number of deputies, the provisions of the federal Constitution applied equally to the national councils of each republic: deputies were elected to five-year terms of office; the national councils had to hold at least two sessions annually; and each national council elected its own presidium (fifteen to twenty-one members in the Slovak National Council and up to twenty-five members in the Czech National Council), which was empowered to act when the full national council was not in session.

In each of the two republics the executive branch consists of a premier, three deputy premiers, and a number of ministers. Both the Czech and the Slovak governments had ministers of agriculture and food, construction, culture, development and technology, education, finance, forestry and water resources, health, industry, interior, justice, labor and social affairs, and trade. The chairmen of the State Planning Commission and the People&#x27;s Control Commission also held ministerial status in each republic; the government of the Czech Socialist Republic included, in addition, two ministers without portfolio.

=== Regional and local levels ===
Below the level of the republics (the national administrations), in the 1970s and 1980s, Communist Czechoslovakia was divided into regions kraje, districts okresy, and communities (i. e. towns, villages etc.).

The principal organs of government at these levels, known as national committees, functioned in accordance with the principle of the so-called democratic centralism. The 1968 Constitutional Law of Federation specified that the national governments directed and controlled the activities of all national committees within their respective territories. The system of national committees was established at the close of World War II by the then-existing provisional government and was used by the communists as a means of consolidating and extending their control. On the local level, the membership of the national committees consisted of from fifteen to twenty-five persons. National committees on the higher levels were proportionately larger: national committees at the district level had from 60 to 120 members, and national committees at the kraje level had between 80 and 150 members. National committee members were popularly elected for five-year terms of office. Each national committee elected a council from among its membership. The council, composed of a chairman, one or more deputy chairmen, a secretary, and an unspecified number of members, acted as the coordinating and controlling body of the national committee. To expedite the work of the national committee, the council established commissions and other subcommittees and could issue decrees and ordinances within its area of jurisdiction. The national committees on the local level were assigned particular areas of jurisdiction, including maintaining public order and organizing the implementation of the political, economic, and cultural tasks assigned by the KSC and the federal government. The Constitution charged the national committees with the responsibility of organizing and directing the economic, cultural, health, and social services in their areas. The committees had also to &quot;ensure the protection of socialist ownership&quot; and see that the &quot;rules of socialist conduct are upheld.&quot;

==Elections==
Elections in Czechoslovakia were held not to offer the electorate an opportunity to participate in a democratic choice of their government representatives but to confirm the representatives chosen by the KSC hierarchy. The 1960 constitution guaranteed multicandidate (but not multiparty) elections by requiring that the number of candidates to the National Assembly be greater than the number of posts. VoThe July 1971 electoral law lengthened the time between elections from four to five years (1971, 1976, 1981, 1986, and so forth) and designated that they take place in the fall, so that each election comes shortly after the party congress in the spring. The 1971 law replaced a 1967 electoral law that allowed the electorate to participate in the choice of candidates; the 1967 law was never applied because the 1968 elections were postponed by the August invasion. The November 1971 elections, then, were the first to be held since 1964. In these and subsequent elections, the National Front—nominally a coalition of all parties, but in truth controlled by the Communists—proposed single slates of candidates for the Federal Assembly, the two national councils, and the regional, district, and municipal national committees. The voter only had the option to cross out (disapprove) or not cross out (approve) the name of any or all official candidates nominated by the National Front. Polling booths are rarely used, and voting was often carried out collectively by the work force of each enterprise or by other groups of the population.

The 1971 elections were preceded by a concerted effort by a group of dissidents calling themselves the Socialist Movement of Czechoslovak Citizens to urge citizens to boycott the elections or cross off official names in protest of the undemocratic character of the 1971 election law. Official election results, nevertheless, showed that 99.5 percent of the 10.3 million eligible voters did cast ballots, and of these, some 99.8 percent voted for the official candidates. Following the election, rumors circulated that, in fact, up to 10 percent of the population had not voted and that between 10 and 25 percent of the voters had crossed out official names. Whatever the case, after the election some 200 persons associated with the Socialist Movement of Czechoslovak Citizens were arrested. Trials were held during July and August 1972, at which 47 persons were sentenced to a total of 118 years in prison.

In elections held in May 1986, Czechoslovak officials reported that 99.4 percent of registered voters participated in the Federal Assembly elections, and 99.9 percent of the total vote cast went to National Front candidates. Similar results were reported in the elections for the Czech National Council and the Slovak National Council and in the lower-level national committees.

<text>Charter 77 (&quot;Charta 77&quot; in Czech and Slovak) was an informal civic initiative in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic from 1976 to 1992, named after the document Charter 77 from January 1977. Founding members and architects were Jiří Němec, Václav Benda, Ladislav Hejdánek, Václav Havel, Jan Patočka, Zdeněk Mlynář, Jiří Hájek, Martin Palouš, Pavel Kohout, and Ladislav Lis. Spreading the text of the document was considered a political crime by the Czechoslovak government. After the 1989 Velvet Revolution, many of the members of the initiative played important roles in Czech and Slovak politics.

==Founding and political aims==
Motivated in part by the arrest of members of the rock band the Plastic People of the Universe, the text of Charter 77 was prepared in 1976. The first preparatory meeting took place on 10 December 1976 in Jaroslav Kořán&#x27;s apartment, and initial signatures were collected.

The charter was published on 6 January 1977, along with the names of the first 242 signatories, which represented various occupations, political viewpoints, and religions. Although Václav Havel, Ludvík Vaculík, and Pavel Landovský were detained while trying to bring the charter to the Federal Assembly and the Czechoslovak government, and the original document was confiscated, copies circulated as samizdat and on 7 January were published in several western newspapers, including &quot;Le Monde&quot;, &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;, and &quot;The Times&quot;, and transmitted within Czechoslovakia by Czechoslovak-banned radio broadcasters like Radio Free Europe and Voice of America. Almost three weeks later, on 27 January, it was also published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

Charter 77 criticized the government for failing to implement the human rights provisions of a number of documents it had signed, including the 1960 Constitution of Czechoslovakia, the Final Act of the 1975 Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (Basket III of the Helsinki Accords), and the 1966 United Nations covenants on political, civil, economic, and cultural rights. The document also described the signatories as a &quot;loose, informal, and open association of people . . . united by the will to strive individually and collectively for respect for human and civil rights in our country and throughout the world&quot;. It emphasized that Charter 77 is not an organization, has no statutes or permanent organs, and &quot;does not form the basis for any oppositional political activity&quot;. This final stipulation was a careful effort to stay within the bounds of Czechoslovak law, which made organized opposition illegal.

Many of the organization&#x27;s activists and members gathered on 29 March 2007 at the Orange Tree Theatre in Richmond, London, to observe the movement&#x27;s 30th anniversary and to discuss the historical impact their movement generated in modern European politics.

==Reaction of the government==
The government&#x27;s reaction to the appearance of Charter 77 was harsh. The official press described the manifesto as &quot;an anti-state, anti-socialist, and demagogic, abusive piece of writing&quot;, and individual signatories were variously described as &quot;traitors and renegades&quot;, &quot;a loyal servant and agent of imperialism&quot;, &quot;a bankrupt politician&quot;, and &quot;an international adventurer&quot;. As it was considered to be an illegal document, the full text of Charter 77 was never published in the official press. However, an official group of artists and writers mobilized into an &quot;anti-charter&quot; movement that included Czechoslovakia&#x27;s foremost singer Karel Gott, as well as prominent comedic writer Jan Werich, who later claimed he was misled about the nature of the document he was signing. 

Several means of retaliation were used against the signatories, including dismissal from work, denial of educational opportunities for their children, forced exile, loss of citizenship, and detention, trial, and imprisonment. Many members were forced to collaborate with the communist secret service (the StB, Czech: Státní bezpečnost).

The treatment of Charter 77 signatories prompted the creation in April 1978 of a support group, the Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly Prosecuted (&quot;Výbor na obranu nespravedlivě stíhaných&quot; – VONS), to publicize the fate of those associated with the charter. In October 1979, six leaders of this support group, including Václav Havel, were tried for subversion and sentenced to prison terms of up to five years.

Repression of Charter 77 and VONS members continued during the 1980s. Despite unrelenting harassment and arrests, however, the groups continued to issue reports on the government&#x27;s violations of human rights. Until the Velvet Revolution, Charter 77 had approximately 1,900 signatories.

==Influence==
Under the Communist government, the influence of Charter 77 remained limited. It did not reach wide groups of people and most of its members were from Prague. The majority of Czechoslovak citizens knew of the initiative only because of the government&#x27;s campaign against it.

In the late 1980s, as the Eastern Bloc Revolutions of 1989 gathered momentum, members of Charter 77 saw their opportunity and became more involved in organizing opposition against the ruling authority. During the days of the Velvet Revolution, members of the group negotiated the smooth transfer of political power from dictatorship to democracy. Many were elevated into high positions in the government (e.g., Václav Havel became the President of Czechoslovakia) but since most had no experience in active politics (such as skills in diplomacy or knowledge of capitalism), they met with mixed success. 

Charter 77 included people who had a wide range of opinions and, after reaching their common goal, the group&#x27;s presence faded. An attempt to make the group the focal point of an all-encompassing political party (the Civic Forum) failed and in 1992, the initiative dissolved.

<doc id="424008" wikidata="Q2922269" url="?curid=424008" title="0-6-0">
<text> is the Whyte notation designation for steam locomotives with a wheel arrangement of no leading wheels, six powered and coupled driving wheels on three axles, and no trailing wheels. Historically, this was the most common wheel arrangement used on both tender and tank locomotives in versions with both inside and outside cylinders.

In the United Kingdom, the Whyte notation of wheel arrangement was also often used for the classification of electric and diesel-electric locomotives with side-rod coupled driving wheels. Under the UIC classification, popular in Europe, this wheel arrangement is written as C if the wheels are coupled with rods or gears, or Co if they are independently driven, the latter usually being electric and diesel-electric locomotives.
==Overview==

===History===
The 0-6-0 configuration was the most widely used wheel arrangement for both tender and tank steam locomotives. The type was also widely used for diesel switchers (shunters). Because they lack leading and trailing wheels, locomotives of this type have all their weight pressing down on their driving wheels and consequently have a high tractive effort and factor of adhesion, making them comparatively strong engines for their size, weight and fuel consumption. On the other hand, the lack of unpowered leading wheels have the result that 0-6-0 locomotives are less stable at speed. They are therefore mostly used on trains where high speed is unnecessary.

Since 0-6-0 tender engines can pull fairly heavy trains, albeit slowly, the type was commonly used to pull short and medium distance freight trains such as pickup goods trains along both main and branch lines. The tank engine versions were widely used as switching (shunting) locomotives since the smaller 0-4-0 types were not large enough to be versatile in this job. and larger switching locomotives, on the other hand, were too big to be economical or even usable on lightly built railways such as dockyards and goods yards, precisely the sorts of places where switching locomotives were most needed.

The earliest 0-6-0 locomotives had outside cylinders, as these were simpler to construct and maintain. However, once designers began to overcome the problem of the breakage of the crank axles, inside cylinder versions were found to be more stable. Thereafter this pattern was widely adopted, particularly in the United Kingdom, although outside cylinder versions were also widely used.

Tank engine versions of the type began to be built in quantity in the mid-1850s and had become very common by the mid-1860s.

===Early examples===
0-6-0 locomotives were among the first types to be used. The earliest recorded example was the &quot;Royal George&quot;, built by Timothy Hackworth for the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1827.

Other early examples included the &quot;Vulcan&quot;, the first inside-cylinder type, built by Charles Tayleur and Company in 1835 for the Leicester and Swannington Railway, and &quot;Hector&quot;, a Long Boiler locomotive, built by Kitson and Company in 1845 for the York and North Midland Railway.
&quot;Derwent&quot;, a two-tender locomotive built in 1845 by William and Alfred Kitching for the Stockton and Darlington Railway, is preserved at Darlington Railway Centre and Museum.

===Suffixes===
For a steam tank locomotive, the suffix usually indicates the type of tank or tanks:
* 0-6-0Tside tanks
* 0-6-0STsaddle tank
* 0-6-0PTpannier tanks
* 0-6-0WTwell tank

Other steam locomotive suffixes include
* 0-6-0VBvertical boiler
* 0-6-0Ffireless locomotive
* 0-6-0Ggeared steam locomotive

For a diesel locomotive, the suffix indicates the transmission type:
* 0-6-0DMmechanical transmission
* 0-6-0DHhydraulic transmission
* 0-6-0DEelectric transmission

==Usage==
All the major continental European railways used 0-6-0s of one sort or another, though usually not in the proportions used in the United Kingdom. As in the United States, European 0-6-0 locomotives were largely restricted to switching and station pilot duties, though they were also widely used on short branch lines to haul passenger and freight trains. On most branch lines, though, larger and more powerful tank engines tended to be favoured.

===Australia===
In New South Wales, the Z19 class was a tender type with this wheel arrangement. The Dorrigo Railway Museum collection includes seven Locomotives of the 0-6-0 wheel arrangement, including two Z19 class (1904 and 1923), three 0-6-0 saddle tanks and two 0-6-0 side tanks.

In Victoria, the Geelong and Melbourne Railway Company operated four 0-6-0WT (well tank) goods locomotives; one of their 2-2-2WT passenger locomotives (&quot;Titania&quot;, which became Victorian Railways number 34 in 1860) was converted to an in 1872.

On the Victorian Railways system there were O, P, Q, old R, Belgian R, new R, RY, T, U, Nos.103 &amp; 105 (unclassed), old V, X, and Y class 0-6-0 tender locomotives, as well as a solitary Z class 0-6-0T (tank) engine. Three types of 0-6-0 Diesel shunting locomotives were also used by the Victorian Railways, the F, M, and W classes.

===Finland===

Tank locomotives used by Finland were the VR Class Vr1 and VR Class Vr4.

The VR Class Vr1s were numbered 530 to 544, 656 to 670 and 787 to 799. They had outside cylinders and were operational from 1913 to 1975. Built by Tampella, Finland and Hanomag (Hannoversche Maschinenbau AG), they were nicknamed &quot;Chicken&quot;. Number 669 is preserved at the Finnish Railway Museum.

The Vr4s were a class of only four locomotives, numbered 1400 to 1423, originally built as 0-6-0s by Vulcan Iron Works, United States, but modified to 0-6-2s in 1951–1955, and re-classified as Vr5.
Finland&#x27;s tender locomotives were the classes C1, C2, C3, C4, C5 and C6.

The Finnish Steam Locomotive Class C1s were a class of ten locomotives numbered 21 to 30. They were operational from 1869 to 1926. They were built by Neilson and Company and were nicknamed &quot;Bristollari&quot;. Number 21, preserved at the Finnish Railway Museum, is the second oldest preserved locomotive in Finland.

The eighteen Class C2s were numbered 31 to 43 and 48 to 52. They were also nicknamed &quot;Bristollari&quot;.

The C3 was a class of only two locomotives, numbered 74 and 75.

The thirteen Class C4s were numbered 62 and 78 to 89.

The fourteen Finnish Steam Locomotive Class C5s were numbered 101 to 114. They were operational from 1881 to 1930. They were built by Hanomag in Hannover and were nicknamed &quot;Bliksti&quot;. No 110 is preserved at the Finnish Railway Museum.

The C6 was a solitary class of one locomotive, numbered 100.

=== Indonesia ===
==== Skirt tank locomotives ====

The colonial government of the Dutch East Indies ordered &quot;Nederlandsch Indische Spoorweg Maatschappij&quot; (NIS) to build a 3 ft 6 in (1,067 mm) railway line connecting Yogyakarta to Magelang around 47 km (29 miles), which was the important city for the economic and defense sectors in Central Java and finished in 1898. By 1903–1907, they continued to build the line from Magelang to Secang–Ambarawa–Temanggung–Parakan because there were tobacco plantations. Just after the line finished, the NIS ordered around 12 units of 0-6-0T (skirt tank) locomotives from Sachsische Maschinenfabrik (Hartmann), Germany and came in 1899-1908 and they were classified as NIS Class 250 (NIS 250–262), these locomotives were used to haul mixed freight and passenger trains. By 1914, NIS Class 251, 253, 255, 256, 257 were moved to Solo (Purwosari)–Boyolali (23 km / 14 miles) line and Solo–Wonogiri–Baturetno (51 km / 32 miles) line for sugarcane freight and passenger transports, both of the lines were purchased by NIS from the &quot;Solosche Tramweg Maatschappij&quot; (SoTM) or Solo Tramway Company. They also acquired a 0-6-0T which had been operated by SoTM with similar characteristic and performance also its manufacturer which then completed its skirt tanks collection to 13 units and renumbered as NIS Class 259. At first, these 0-6-0Ts were saturated steam and the tanks are located at both low sides of boiler near the wheels, they have a water capacity of 3 m3 and their length is 7,940 mm and they used inside cylinders. The driving wheels of the locomotive has a distinctive feature, using the &#x27;Golsdorf&#x27; wheel movement systems. By this, all wheels (first wheel, second and third wheel) would only shift left/right following the rail track. Wheels with the &#x27;Golsdorf&#x27; system are suitable for railroads with a large bend radius. This system was patented by Austrian railway engineer Karl Golsdorf. By 1924–1931, the NIS Class 250, 252, 254, 258 and 259 were converted and equipped with superheater technology and cylinder with piston valve. During Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies in 1942, all of Dutch East Indies private or state owned railway locomotives were renumbered based on Japanese numberings, while the NIS Class 250s were renumbered to C16, C17 and C18 and still used after Indonesian Independence by &quot;Djawatan Kereta Api&quot; (DKA) or Department of the Railways of Railways of the Republic of Indonesia until the era of &quot;Perusahaan Jawatan Kereta Api&quot; (PJKA) or Railway Bureau Company, out of 13 locomotives only C16 03, C17 04 and C18 01 are preserved in Ambarawa Railway Museum.

==== Side tank locomotives ====

&quot;Nederlandsch Indische Spoorweg Maatschappij&quot; (NIS) was known operating its 4 ft 8½ in (1,435 mm) gauge between Samarang–&quot;Vorstenlanden&quot; (Solo and Yogyakarta), Brumbung–Gundih and Kedungjati–Ambarawa all of which had been built in the 1870s. NIS expanded its rail network in &quot;Jogja&quot; (another term of Yogyakarta) by building branch lines between Yogyakarta–Brosot–Sewugalur in 1895 and Yogyakarta–Pundong in 1919. The line construction in and around Jogja was also to serve the freight transports of sugarcane from many sugar mills that operating in the royal land of Yogyakarta Sultanate. NIS imported another 10 new 0-6-0Ts as standard-gauge runner on Samarang–&quot;Vorstenlanden&quot; and came in 2 batches in 1910 and 1912 from Werkspoor, N.V., Netherlands. The first batch engines were classified as NIS 151–156, those on second batch were NIS 157–160 and equipped with steam brake. These locomotives often worked on southern lines of &quot;Jogja&quot;. Since Japanese occupation in 1942, the entire of NIS standard-gauge lines were converted to 3 ft 6 in (1,067 mm) gauge which made almost NIS standard gauge locomotives were found derelict. All of NIS 151–160 were also scrapped after Indonesian Independence, while the last one of them was found derelict in Pengok Workshop, Yogyakarta in 1974.

In 1901, the &quot;Staatsspoorwegen&quot; (SS) acquired 24 units of 0-6-0Ts from &quot;Solo Vallei Waterwerken&quot; or Solo Valley Waterworks after they sold it due to debts as a result of swelling funds for the construction of irrigation canal dams on the banks of the Bengawan Solo and then, SS classified them as SS Class 500 (501–524). Not quite a long, a local private tramway company named &quot;Pasoeroean Stoomtram Maatschappij&quot; (PsSM) bought 2 units from SS to assist their sugar-freight transports to the port there along with their Hohenzollern 0-4-0Tr engines in 1905 and 1908. The remaining owned by the SS were renumbered as SS Class 24–45 and used to aid mainline and rural tramlines, especially in East Java between Garahan–Banyuwangi line using as transport for construction materials and metal bridge girders. After that, they were used as yard shunter and short harbor works at Banyuwangi and Panarukan. While 2 units of &quot;Solo Vallei&quot; which were acquired by PsSM renumbered to PsSM 6 Louisa (former SS 506) and PsSM 7 Marie (former SS 516), by 1911 they also purchased brand new of the same type PsSM 8 Nella. These locomotives were manufactured by John Cockerill &amp; Cie., Belgium. After Japanese occupation, the SS Class 24–45 were renumbered as C13 class and PsSM 6–8 were reclassified as C22 class, the C13s were brought by Japanese throughout Java while the C22s were brought to Mojokerto as yard shunt duties. From all of these locomotives, not a single one remains. All of them were scrapped around the 1970s.
In addition to operating trams for transportation facilities in the city of Semarang, Central Java, the private tramway company of Semarang-Joana or &quot;Semarang-Joana Stoomtram Maatschappij&quot; (SJS) was also extending the construction of their 3 ft 6 in (1,067 mm) lines to the east, which connected to Rembang, Blora and Cepu. The line of Semarang–Demak–Kudus–Rembang (197 km / 122 miles) was built in 1883–1900, while the Rembang–Blora–Cepu line (70 km / 43 miles) was completed in 1902. The line to Cepu was used for oil transportation and by this area there are fairly extensive teak forests. To serve the freight or passenger transportation on those lines, the SJS ordered 12 &#x27;0-6-0T&#x27; locomotives from Sächsische Maschinenfabrik (Hartmann) and came in 1898–1902 and classified as SJS Class 100 (101–112). Originally these locomotives had a funnel-shaped chimney, but was later replaced by a straight one and also equipped with a sand box which it made of brass. During Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies, all of SJS Class 100s were renumbered to C19 and still used up today. After World War II ended, 2 units of C19 locomotives were moved from Java to West Sumatra at the Padang locomotive depot to meet the needs of rail transportation in West Sumatra. At the end of its service period around 1973, the C19 locomotive was used to haul the molasses tank wagons around Probolinggo–Pajarakan. From 12 of them, only C19 12 or SJS 112 is preserved at the Transportation Museum of Taman Mini Indonesia Indah, Jakarta.

In 1895–1896, two private-owned tramway company named &quot;Modjokerto Stoomtram Mij.&quot; (Mdj.SM) and &quot;Babat Djombang Stoomtram Mij.&quot; (BDSM) received the permit concession from the colonial Dutch government to build the line of Porong–Gunung Gangsir–Bangil–Pandaan–Japanan–Mojokerto and Sidoarjo–Tarik–Mojokerto–Jombang which were connected to &quot;Staatsspoorwegen&quot; (SS) lines. In addition, the BDSM was also built their line of Babat–Jombang to serve sugarcane freight transports which was connected to Nederlandsch-Indische Spoorweg Mij. (NIS) line at the Soerabaia NIS (Surabaya Pasar Turi), Babat and Cepu railway stations. The Mdj. SM completed their line construction in 1899, while BDSM completed in 1902 and 1913. To serve their rail transports, The Mdj. SM imported 4 locomotives in 1907–1926 (classified as MSM 11, 12, 15 and 16) and BDSM imported 2 of them in 1903 and 1903 (classified as BDSM 9 &amp;10) from Georg Krauß, Germany. BDSM was defunct in 1916 due to the company&#x27;s financial difficulties, so all of its assets including their two 0-6-0T units were acquired by SS (became SS 113 &amp;114). After Japanese occupation, they were classified as C21 class. From 6 of them only 2 remained, the C21 02 of BDSM in INKA, Madiun and C21 03 of Mdj. SM in Taman Mini Indonesia Indah.

==== Well Tank locomotives ====

Type C2-Lts later classified as NIS 106 and NIS 107 were the first generation of 0-6-0WT operated by NIS from Hanomag, Germany and came in 1901. These C2-Lts were wood and coal burners and had a maximum speed of 40 kilometres per hour (24.8 miles per hour). These locomotives often worked on southern lines of &quot;Jogja&quot;. Since Japanese occupation in 1942, the entire of NIS standard-gauge lines were converted to 3 ft 6 in (1,067 mm) gauge which made almost NIS standard gauge locomotives were found derelict. Just before occupation, NIS 106 and 107 were converted became armored locomotive by J. C. Jonker who was the former head of NIS traction depot. The last known NIS 106 was re-gauged to 1,067 mm and operating as short harbor works in Semarang in July 1945 before being scrapped by Japanese. The chassis of NIS 107 still be found in front of SMK Negeri 2 Yogyakarta (state vocational school), while the most parts of it had been stripped down by the Japanese.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand the 0-6-0 design was restricted to tank engines. The Hunslet-built M class of 1874 and Y class of 1923 provided 7 examples, however the F class built between 1872 and 1888 was the most prolific, surviving the entire era of NZR steam operations, with 88 examples of which 8 were preserved.

===Philippines===

This wheel arrangement was first introduced in 1905. Most of the preserved steam locomotives in the country are of this type as they were popular among sugarcane plantation, sawmill and coal mine owners.

====Tank and tank-tender locomotives====
The first operators of the type were the Manila Railway with its 0-6-0T &quot;Cabanatuan&quot; class, named after the now-defunct branch line towards Cabanatuan. Two of these locomotives were built, No. 777 &quot;Cabanatuan&quot; and No. 778 &quot;Batangas&quot;. It was followed by the 0-6-2ST &quot;Cavite&quot; class of 1906, after also defunct Naic branch of the PNR South Main Line. This was later known as the &quot;V&quot; class. No. 777 &quot;Cabanatuan&quot; and No. 1007 &quot;Dagupan&quot; (originally &quot;Cavite&quot;) are in display in front of the Philippine National Railways headquarters at Tutuban station in Tondo, Manila.

This type was also used by the 3 ft gauge railways in Negros Island. Central Azucarera de Bais operated 3 tank locomotives. The De La Rama conglomerate of Bago, Negros Occidental led by Esteban de la Rama (1866–1947) had Locomotive No. 2. Other operators include Ma-Ao Sugar Central, the National Coal Company in which used this locomotive as a 0-6-0STT tank tender, and San Carlos Milling Company No. 4 of 1919.

====Tender locomotives====
The Hawaiian-Philippine Company of Silay, Negros Occidental operates three 0-6-0 tender locomotives and are the last active steam locomotives in the country. The three locomotives are No. 2 &quot;Peter Francis Davies&quot; of 1919, No. 5 &quot;The Isabella Curran&quot; of 1920 and No. 7 &quot;Edwin H. Herkes&quot; of 1928. These are still used for its heritage railway service after the rail freight service was terminated in 2021. No. 7 was later renamed as the second &quot;Isabella Curran&quot;. Aside from these, the company also had two more locomotives of the same arrangement that were most likely scrapped.

Other known operators of tender locomotives include Central Azucarera de Bais with its Baldwin-built also numbered No. 7, North Negros Sugar Company, San Carlos No. 5 of 1926, and Tabacalera Central No. 5 of 1927. Out of these, only the Tabacalera Central No. 5 uses the 3 ft 6 in gauge lines being operated in Tarlac while the other units use the 3 ft gauge.

===South Africa===

====Cape gauge====
In 1876, the Cape Government Railways (CGR) placed a pair of 0-6-0 Stephenson&#x27;s Patent permanently coupled back-to-back tank locomotives in service on the Cape Eastern system. They worked out of East London in comparative trials with the experimental Fairlie locomotive that was acquired in that same year.
The Natal Harbours Department placed a single saddle-tank locomotive in service in 1879, named &quot;John Milne&quot;.

The Natal Government Railways placed a single locomotive in shunting service in 1880, later designated Class K, virtually identical to the Durban Harbour&#x27;s John Milne and built by the same manufacturer.

In 1882, two 0-6-0 tank locomotives entered service on the private Kowie Railway between Grahamstown and Port Alfred. Both locomotives were rebuilt to a 4-4-0T wheel arrangement in 1884.

In 1890, the Nederlandsche-Zuid-Afrikaansche Spoorweg-Maatschappij of the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek (Transvaal Republic) placed six 18 Tonner 0-6-0ST locomotives in service on construction work.

In 1896 and 1897, three 26 Tonner saddle-tank locomotives were built for the Pretoria-Pietersburg Railway (PPR) by Hawthorn, Leslie and Company. These were the first locomotives to be obtained by the then recently established PPR. Two of these, named &quot;Nylstroom&quot; and &quot;Pietersburg&quot;, came into SAR stock in 1912 and survived into the 1940s.
In 1901, a single 0-6-0T harbour locomotive built by Hudswell, Clarke was delivered to the Harbours Department of Natal. It was named &quot;Edward Innes&quot; and retained this name when it was taken onto the SAR roster in 1912.

Two saddle-tank locomotives were supplied to the East London Harbour Board in 1902, built by Hunslet. Both survived until the 1930s, well into the SAR era.

In 1904, a single saddle tank harbour locomotive, named &quot;Sir Albert&quot;, was built by Hunslet for the Harbours Department of Natal. It came into SAR stock in 1912 and was withdrawn in 1915.

====Narrow gauges====
In 1871, two gauge tank locomotives, built by the Lilleshall Company of Oakengates, Shropshire in 1870 and 1871, were placed in service by the Cape of Good Hope Copper Mining Company. Named &quot;John King&quot; and &quot;Miner&quot;, they were the first steam locomotives to enter service on the hitherto mule-powered Namaqualand Railway between Port Nolloth and the Namaqualand copper mines around O&#x27;okiep in the Cape Colony.

In 1902, Arthur Koppel, acting as agent, imported a single 0-6-0 narrow gauge tank steam locomotive for a customer in Durban. It was then purchased by the Cape Government Railways and used as construction locomotive on the Avontuur branch from 1903. In 1912, this locomotive was assimilated into the South African Railways and in 1917 it was sent to German South West Africa during the First World War campaign in that territory.

===South West Africa===

Between 1898 and 1905, more than fifty pairs of Zwillinge twin tank steam locomotives were acquired by the &quot;Swakopmund-Windhuk Staatsbahn&quot; (Swakopmund-Windhoek State Railway) in &quot;Deutsch-Südwest-Afrika&quot; (DSWA, now Namibia). Zwillinge locomotives were a class of small &quot;Schmalspur&quot; (narrow gauge) tank steam locomotives that were built in Germany in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As indicated by their name &quot;Zwillinge&quot; (twins), they were designed to be used in pairs, semi-permanently coupled back-to-back at the cabs, allowing a single footplate crew to fire and control both locomotives. The pairs of locomotives shared a common manufacturer&#x27;s works number and engine number, with the units being designated as A and B. By 1922, when the SAR took control of all railway operations in South West Africa (SWA), only two single Illinge locomotives survived to be absorbed onto the roster of the SAR.

In 1907, the German Administration in DSWA acquired three Class Hc tank locomotives for the narrow gauge Otavi Mining and Railway Company. One more entered service in 1910, and another was obtained by the South African Railways in 1929.

In 1911, the &quot;Lüderitzbucht Eisenbahn&quot; (Lüderitzbucht Railway) placed two Cape gauge 0-6-0T locomotives in service as shunting engines. They were apparently no longer in service when all railways in the territory came under the administration of the South African Railways in 1922.

===Switzerland===
During the Second World War, Switzerland converted some 0-6-0 shunting engines into electric–steam locomotives.

===United Kingdom===
The 0-6-0 inside-cylinder tender locomotive type was extremely common in Britain for more than a century and was still being built in large numbers during the 1940s. Between 1858 and 1872, 943 examples of the John Ramsbottom DX goods class were built by the London and North Western Railway and the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. This was the earliest example of standardisation and mass production of locomotives.
Of the total stock of standard-gauge locomotives operating on British railways in 1900, around 20,000 engines, over a third were 0-6-0 tender types. The ultimate British was the Q1 &quot;Austerity&quot; type, developed by the Southern Railway during the Second World War to haul very heavy freight trains. It was the most powerful steam design produced in Europe.

Similarly, the 0-6-0 tank locomotives became the most common locomotive type on all railways throughout the 20th century. All of the Big Four companies to emerge from the Railways Act, 1921 grouping used them in vast numbers. The Great Western Railway, in particular, had many of the type, most characteristically in the form of the pannier tank locomotive that remained in production well past railway nationalisation in 1948.

When diesel shunters began to be introduced, the 0-6-0 type became the most common. Many of the British Railways shunter types were , including Class 03, the standard light shunter, and Class 08 and Class 09, the standard heavier shunters.

===United States===
In the United States, huge numbers of 0-6-0 locomotives were produced, with the majority of them being used as switchers. The USRA 0-6-0 was the smallest of the USRA Standard classes designed and produced during the brief government control of the railroads through the USRA during the First World War. 255 of them were built and ended up in the hands of about two dozen United States railroads.
In addition, many of the railroads (and others) built numerous copies after the war. The Pennsylvania Railroad rostered over 1,200 0-6-0 types over the years, which were classed as class B on that system. The United States 0-6-0s were generally tender locomotives.

During the Second World War, no fewer than 514 USATC S100 Class 0-6-0 tank engines were built by the Davenport Locomotive Works, for use by the United States Army Transportation Corps in both Europe and North Africa. Some of these remained in service long after the war, having been purchased or otherwise adopted by the countries where they were used. These included Austria, Egypt, France, Iraq, the United Kingdom and Yugoslavia.

The fourteen SR USA Class engines purchased by the British Southern Railway in 1946 remained in service well into the 1960s. Designed to be extremely strong but easy to maintain, these engines had a very short wheelbase that allowed them to operate on dockyard railways.

<doc id="424010" wikidata="Q2093829" url="?curid=424010" title="USS Tullibee (SSN-597)">
<text>USS &quot;Tullibee&quot; (SSN-597), a unique submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the tullibee, any of several whitefishes of central and northern North America.

At 273 feet long and 2,640 tons displacement, USS &quot;Tullibee&quot; was the smallest nuclear-powered attack submarine in the US submarine fleet, although she was originally designed mainly for the anti-submarine (ASW) &#x27;hunter-killer&#x27; role and was redesignated an attack submarine when the two roles were merged. The initial manning complement was 7 officers and 60 enlisted men. However before inactivation, the crew included 13 officers and over 100 enlisted men.

During her career, &quot;Tullibee&quot; achieved much and conducted many submarine firsts. During her commissioned service she submerged and surfaced 730 times and traveled approximately equal to the distance from the Earth to the Moon and halfway back.

==Construction==
&quot;Tullibee&quot; was the result of Project Nobska, a study ordered in 1956 by Admiral Arleigh Burke, then Chief of Naval Operations, from the Committee on Undersea Warfare of the National Academy of Sciences. That report emphasized the need for deeper-diving, ultraquiet submarine designs using long-range sonar to accomplish the anti-submarine (ASW) &#x27;hunter-killer&#x27; mission. &quot;Tullibee&quot; incorporated three design innovations inspired by Project Nobska. First, it incorporated the first bow-mounted spherical sonar array. This required the second innovation: angled torpedo tubes amidships. Thirdly, &quot;Tullibee&quot; was propelled by a very quiet turbo-electric transmission powered by a S2C reactor and producing 2,500 shp (~1,900 kW).

The contract to build &quot;Tullibee&quot; was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of the General Dynamics Corporation on 15 November 1957. Her keel was laid down in Groton, Connecticut, on 26 May 1958. She was launched on 27 April 1960, sponsored by Mrs. John F. Davidson, the widow of Commander Charles F. Brindupke, CO of when it was lost on 26 March 1944, and commissioned on 9 November 1960, with Commander Richard E. Jortberg in command.

While &quot;Tullibee&quot; was very successful from a technology perspective, she was not repeated on cost-effective grounds. &quot;Tullibee&quot;&#x27;s unexpected high cost of construction coupled with her intentionally inferior overall performance compared with the contemporary &quot;Thresher&quot; attack submarine convinced the Navy to abandon the specialized hunter-killer submarine concept and assign the hunter-killer role to the attack submarines. The Navy then attempted to scale up the &quot;Tullibee&quot; engineering plant to make it suitable for a full-sized attack submarine, but the result - the &quot;Glenard P. Lipscomb&quot; - was also judged to be not completely successful and was not repeated.

==Operational history==

===1961–1968===
Following her shakedown in January 1961, &quot;Tullibee&quot; engaged in sonar evaluations and nuclear submarine tactical exercises with Submarine Developmental Group 2, operating out of Naval Submarine Base New London, Connecticut, into 1963. During this period, the ship visited Bermuda on several occasions, as well as San Juan, Puerto Rico.

In July 1964, &quot;Tullibee&quot; participated in fleet exercises in anti-submarine warfare (ASW) tactics with NATO units. The submarine resumed developmental work in 1965 and operated in this capacity into the autumn of that year. On 28 October her home port was temporarily changed to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, when the ship entered the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, for an extensive overhaul. She remained in drydock for 754 days (2 years and 24 days), emerging on 2 January 1968.

===1969–1979===
Shifted back to New London, &quot;Tullibee&quot; deployed to the Caribbean Sea in January 1969 following refresher training and continued developmental work during 1969 and 1970. On 1 August 1970, &quot;Tullibee&quot; departed New London, bound for the Mediterranean and the ship&#x27;s first service with the Sixth Fleet. During this period, she took part in NATO and Sixth Fleet exercises and made port visits to Athens, Greece; Naples, Italy; and Rota, Spain, before returning to New London on 14 December, having traveled some in 135 days.

In early 1971, the submarine returned to developmental exercises once more to work on SSN tactics and also made a port visit to Cape Canaveral, Florida. Participating in a major NATO exercise in the western Atlantic, &quot;Tullibee&quot; visited Halifax, Nova Scotia, before she received the Meritorious Unit Commendation for her contingency operations in the Mediterranean Sea during the previous year (from 9 September to 31 October 1970). For the remainder of the year 1971, &quot;Tullibee&quot; operated in the western Atlantic on NATO and ASW exercises. During this period, too, &quot;Tullibee&quot; received the Arleigh Burke Fleet Trophy for significant improvement in the ship&#x27;s battle efficiency and readiness for that fiscal year.

The submarine conducted regular operations with the Atlantic Fleet Submarine Force into 1974, operating off the east coast and in the Caribbean Sea. Following one Caribbean cruise in the fall of 1974, &quot;Tullibee&quot; departed New London on 28 April 1975 for her second deployment to the Sixth Fleet. After operating in the Mediterranean into the fall of that year, the submarine returned to New London in October for an extended period of upkeep.

&quot;Tullibee&quot; subsequently participated in sonar evaluation tests with British destroyer in the Caribbean Sea in two separate deployments between April and June 1976, before undergoing another extended upkeep period. The submarine conducted ASW operations and local operations into the fall of 1976. In October 1976, the ship received the &quot;Golden Anchor&quot; Award from the Commander in Chief, U. S. Atlantic Fleet (CINCLANTFLT), for meritorious retention. She departed New London on 12 November for her third Mediterranean deployment attached to the SIXTH Fleet. &quot;Tullibee&quot; conducted several significant SIXTH Fleet operations and participated in key NATO exercises. Her excellence in the area of anti-submarine warfare during this patrol was acknowledged by the Commander U.S. SIXTH Fleet of the prestigious &quot;HOOK &#x27;EM&quot; Award for ASW Excellence in the spring of 1977. She returned to her home port on 24 April 1977 and during the remainder of the year, &quot;Tullibee&quot; underwent three upkeep periods interspersed with ASW exercises off the east coast of the United States. The early months of 1978 were spent in preparation for her fourth Mediterranean deployment. Departing New London in March, the submarine conducted operations with various units of the Sixth Fleet. The deployment was marred somewhat by a propulsion casualty which necessitated a two-month repair period spent at Rota, Spain. &quot;Tullibee&quot; returned to New London on 30 August. Operations out of that port took &quot;Tullibee&quot; into 1979.

===1979–1987===
On 24 July 1979, Commander Daniel J. Koczur relieved as the eighth Commanding Officer. During August 1979, &quot;Tullibee&quot; entered Portsmouth Naval Shipyard for its third and final major overhaul. This overhaul lasted until October 1982 (a total of 39 months). After leaving the shipyard, the remaining months of 1982 were spent conducting various operations, which provided refresher training for the crew.

On 26 April 1983, Commander David W. Candler relieved as the ninth Commanding Officer. On two occasions between April 1983 and February 1984 difficulties with the propulsion system required the ship to return to New London for repairs. In November 1985, the ship departed New London for her fifth and final extended deployment to the Mediterranean Sea. While deployed she conducted several ASW operations for Commander Sixth Fleet and participated in a major NATO ASW exercise. &quot;Tullibee&#x27;s&quot; assignment to the Sixth Fleet during freedom of navigation exercises, involving combat with Libyan forces, resulted in her crew receiving a Navy Expeditionary Medal as well as her first award of a Navy Unit Commendation. The ship returned to New London, Connecticut, in April 1986 after having spent five months deployed.

In November 1986, Commander Charles R. Skolds relieved as the tenth Commanding Officer. The ship remained pier side in New London for the rest of 1986 and most of 1987 while preparing for inactivation. In September 1987 the ship was towed to Portsmouth Naval Shipyard to begin a ten-month inactivation and decommissioning.

==Final disposition==
Decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 25 June 1988, ex-&quot;Tullibee&quot; entered the Navy&#x27;s Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program on 5 January 1995. Recycling was completed on 1 April 1996. One of the fairwater planes from the Tullibee can be seen as part of a permanent art installation at Magnuson Park on the shore of Lake Washington in Seattle.

<doc id="424013" wikidata="Q948500" url="?curid=424013" title="Air Do">
<text>, previously known as , is a Japanese regional airline headquartered in Sapporo, Japan. It operates scheduled service between the islands of Honshu and Hokkaido in cooperation with All Nippon Airways, from its hubs at New Chitose Airport in Sapporo and Haneda Airport in Tokyo.

== History ==
The airline was founded as Hokkaido International Airlines in 1996 by , an entrepreneur in Hokkaido, shortly after the Japanese government approved a domestic airline deregulation policy that would allow carriers to freely set fares on domestic routes. Hamada gathered investments from 29 other individuals who were interested in establishing a low-cost airline to compete with Japan&#x27;s major domestic carriers (All Nippon Airways, Japan Airlines, and Japan Air System) on flights between Hokkaido cities and Tokyo. Additional capital was raised from Kyocera, Tokio Marine &amp; Fire Insurance, Hokkaido Electric Power Company and other institutional investors, as well as from Hokkaido local governments seeking less expensive air service to Tokyo.

The company started flight operations on the Tokyo-Sapporo route, using the Air Do brand, in December 1998. Its first CEO was the former Japan-based manager of Virgin Atlantic. Maintenance and ground handling services were outsourced to Japan Airlines. Air Do enjoyed very high load factors during its first few months of operation, as its fares were 60% to 70% of the walk-up fares offered by established airlines.

However, other airlines quickly adopted their own discounted advance purchase fares in the wake of Air Do&#x27;s initial success, driving load factors down to around 50%. In 2000, the Hokkaido prefectural government injected more capital and installed one of its senior officials as head of the company. After being significantly impacted financially in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks, and being denied additional financing from the Hokkaido prefectural government, Air Do entered Japanese corporate restructuring procedures in June 2002.

Air Do received new equity capital from a &quot;tokumei kumiai&quot; investment fund arranged by the Development Bank of Japan (DBJ), in which All Nippon Airways was a key investor. This began a number of business relationships between Air Do and ANA, including ANA codesharing on Air Do operated flights and Air Do leasing additional 767 and 737 aircraft from ANA. The fund was dissolved in September 2008 and DBJ, ANA and other investors became direct shareholders in Air Do.

On October 1, 2012, the company&#x27;s legal name was changed from Hokkaido International Airlines Co., Ltd. to AIRDO Co., Ltd.

Air Do was sanctioned by the Japanese government in December 2014 for promoting a first officer to captain despite poor performance in training. Following the business improvement order, Air Do in January 2015 moved to eliminate its lowest-yielding routes to Niigata, Toyama, Fukushima and Komatsu.

In May 2021, Air Do and Solaseed Air announced their intentions to merge as a result of operating difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic. In July 2021, Air Do shareholders approved a proposal to issue US$63.2 million of preferred shares to improve finances prior to the business integration. The new holding company for both airlines, , was officially established on October 3, 2022.

== Corporate affairs ==
The airline&#x27;s headquarters are located in the in Chūō-ku, Sapporo.

The company&#x27;s president is Susumu Kusano, who was appointed to the position on June 27, 2019.

== Destinations ==
Over its history, Air Do has operated scheduled services to the following destinations in Japan :

===Codeshare agreements===
Air Do has a codeshare agreement with All Nippon Airways.

== Fleet ==

<doc id="424015" wikidata="Q664174" url="?curid=424015" title="Asbestosis">
<text>Asbestosis is long-term inflammation and scarring of the lungs due to asbestos fibers. Symptoms may include shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, and chest tightness. Complications may include lung cancer, mesothelioma, and pulmonary heart disease.
Asbestosis is caused by breathing in asbestos fibers. It requires a relatively large exposure over a long period of time, which typically only occur in those who directly work with asbestos. All types of asbestos fibers are associated with an increased risk. It is generally recommended that currently existing and undamaged asbestos be left undisturbed. Diagnosis is based upon a history of exposure together with medical imaging. Asbestosis is a type of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.
There is no specific treatment. Recommendations may include influenza vaccination, pneumococcal vaccination, oxygen therapy, and stopping smoking. Asbestosis affected about 157,000 people and resulted in 3,600 deaths in 2015. Asbestos use has been banned in a number of countries in an effort to prevent disease.

Statistics from the UK&#x27;s Health and Safety Executive showed that in 2019, there were 490 asbestosis deaths.

==Signs and symptoms==
The signs and symptoms of asbestosis typically manifest after a significant amount of time has passed following asbestos exposure, often several decades under current conditions in the US. The primary symptom of asbestosis is generally the slow onset of shortness of breath, especially with physical activity. Clinically advanced cases of asbestosis may lead to respiratory failure. When a stethoscope is used to listen to the lungs of a person with asbestosis, they may hear inspiratory &quot;crackles&quot;.

The characteristic pulmonary function finding in asbestosis is a restrictive ventilatory defect. This manifests as a reduction in lung volumes, particularly the vital capacity (VC) and total lung capacity (TLC). The TLC may be reduced through alveolar wall thickening; however, this is not always the case. Large airway function, as reflected by FEV1/FVC, is generally well preserved. In severe cases, the drastic reduction in lung function due to the stiffening of the lungs and reduced TLC may induce right-sided heart failure (cor pulmonale). In addition to a restrictive defect, asbestosis may produce reduction in diffusion capacity and a low amount of oxygen in the blood of the arteries.

==Cause==

The cause of asbestosis is the inhalation of microscopic asbestos mineral fibers suspended in the air. In the 1930s, E. R. A. Merewether found that greater exposure resulted in greater risk.

==Risk factors==
Those who worked in the production, milling, manufacturing, installation, or removal of asbestos products before the late 1970s are at an increased risk of exposure to asbestos. This includes people who worked in these jobs in the United States and Canada. For example:

* Asbestos miners
* Aeronautical and car mechanics 
* Boiler operators 
* Construction workers 
* Electricians 
* Railway workers 
* Workers who remove asbestos insulation from around a steam vessel in an old building 

Construction workers who inhale asbestos from contaminated building materials such as paint, spackling, roof shingles, masonry compounds, and drywall may get asbestosis.
The amount and length of an individual&#x27;s exposure to asbestos are the primary factors that determine the level of risk. The longer one is exposed to the substance, the higher their risk of developing lung damage.

Families of exposed workers can be affected because asbestos fibers from clothing and hair can end up in the home. People who live near mines can also be exposed to airborne asbestos fibers.

==Pathogenesis==
Asbestosis is the scarring of lung tissue (beginning around terminal bronchioles and alveolar ducts and extending into the alveolar walls) resulting from the inhalation of asbestos fibers. There are two types of fibers: amphibole (thin and straight) and serpentine (curly). All forms of asbestos fibers are responsible for human disease as they are able to penetrate deeply into the lungs. When such fibers reach the alveoli (air sacs) in the lung, where oxygen is transferred into the blood, the foreign bodies (asbestos fibers) cause the activation of the lungs&#x27; local immune system and provoke an inflammatory reaction dominated by lung macrophages that respond to chemotactic factors activated by the fibers. This inflammatory reaction can be described as chronic rather than acute, with a slow ongoing progression of the immune system attempting to eliminate the foreign fibers. Macrophages phagocytose (ingest) the fibers and stimulate fibroblasts to deposit connective tissue.

Due to the asbestos fibers&#x27; natural resistance to digestion, some macrophages release inflammatory chemical signals, and other macrophages are killed, releasing reactive oxygen species and activating transcription factors, like NF-kB, which amplify the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These inflammatory chemical signals attract further lung macrophages and fibrolastic cells that synthesize fibrous scar tissue, which eventually becomes diffuse and can progress in heavily exposed individuals. This tissue can be seen microscopically soon after exposure in animal models. Some asbestos fibers become layered by an iron-containing proteinaceous material (ferruginous body) in cases of heavy exposure where about 10% of the fibers become coated. Most inhaled asbestos fibers remain uncoated. About 20% of the inhaled fibers are transported by cytoskeletal components of the alveolar epithelium to the interstitial compartment of the lung where they interact with macrophages and mesenchymal cells. The cytokines, transforming growth factor beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha, appear to play major roles in the development of scarring inasmuch as the process can be blocked in animal models by preventing the expression of the growth factors. The result is fibrosis in the interstitial space, thus asbestosis.

This fibrotic scarring causes alveolar walls to thicken, which reduces elasticity and gas diffusion, reducing oxygen transfer to the blood as well as the removal of carbon dioxide. This can result in shortness of breath, a common symptom exhibited by individuals with asbestosis. Those with asbestosis may be more vulnerable to tumor growth (mesothelioma), because asbestos decreases the cytotoxicity of natural killer cells and impairs the functioning of T helper cells, which detect abnormal cell growth.

==Diagnosis==

According to the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the general diagnostic criteria for asbestosis are:
* Evidence of structural pathology consistent with asbestosis, as documented by imaging or histology
* Evidence of causation by asbestos as documented by the occupational and environmental history, markers of exposure (usually pleural plaques), recovery of asbestos bodies, or other means
* Exclusion of alternative plausible causes for the findings

The abnormal chest x-ray and its interpretation remain the most important factors in establishing the presence of pulmonary fibrosis. The findings usually appear as small, irregular parenchymal opacities, primarily in the lung bases. Using the ILO Classification system, &quot;s&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, and/or &quot;u&quot; opacities predominate. CT or high-resolution CT (HRCT) are more sensitive than plain radiography at detecting pulmonary fibrosis (as well as any underlying pleural changes). More than 50% of people affected with asbestosis develop plaques in the parietal pleura, the space between the chest wall and lungs. Once apparent, the radiographic findings in asbestosis may slowly progress or remain static, even in the absence of further asbestos exposure. Rapid progression suggests an alternative diagnosis.

Asbestosis resembles many other diffuse interstitial lung diseases, including other pneumoconiosis. The differential diagnosis includes idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), hypersensitivity pneumonitis, sarcoidosis, and others. The presence of pleural plaques may provide supportive evidence of causation by asbestos. Although lung biopsy is usually not necessary, the presence of asbestos bodies in association with pulmonary fibrosis establishes the diagnosis. Conversely, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis in the absence of asbestos bodies is most likely not asbestosis. Asbestos bodies in the absence of fibrosis indicate exposure, not disease.

==Treatment==
There is no cure available for asbestosis. Oxygen therapy at home is often necessary to relieve the shortness of breath and correct underlying low blood oxygen levels. Supportive treatment of symptoms includes respiratory physiotherapy to remove secretions from the lungs by postural drainage, chest percussion, and vibration. Nebulized medications may be prescribed in order to loosen secretions or treat underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Immunization against pneumococcal pneumonia and annual influenza vaccination is administered due to increased sensitivity to the diseases. Those with asbestosis are at increased risk for certain cancers. If the person smokes, quitting the habit reduces further damage. Periodic pulmonary function tests, chest x-rays, and clinical evaluations, including cancer screening/evaluations, are given to detect additional hazards.

==Society and culture==
===Legal issues===
On 21 December 1906 H. Montague Murray, M.D., F.R.C.P., testified before a British committee concerning a patient who died in April 1900. Murray indicated that fibrosis of the lungs caused by asbestos dust was a plausible cause of the patient&#x27;s death.

The death of English textile worker Nellie Kershaw in 1924 from pulmonary asbestosis was the first case to be described in medical literature, and the first published account of disease definitely attributed to occupational asbestos exposure. However, her former employers (Turner Brothers Asbestos) denied that asbestosis even existed because the medical condition was not officially recognised at the time. As a result, they accepted no liability for her injuries and paid no compensation, either to Kershaw during her final illness or to her family after her death. Even so, the findings of the inquest into her death were highly influential insofar as they led to a parliamentary enquiry by the British Parliament. The enquiry formally acknowledged the existence of asbestosis, recognised that it was hazardous to health and concluded that it was irrefutably linked to the prolonged inhalation of asbestos dust. Having established the existence of asbestosis on a medical and judicial basis, the report resulted in the first Asbestos Industry Regulations being published in 1931, which came into effect on 1 March 1932.

The first lawsuits against asbestos manufacturers occurred in 1929. Since then, many lawsuits have been filed against asbestos manufacturers and employers, for neglecting to implement safety measures after the link between asbestos, asbestosis and mesothelioma became known (some reports seem to place this as early as 1898 in modern times). The liability resulting from the sheer number of lawsuits and people affected has reached billions of U.S. dollars. The amounts and method of allocating compensation have been the source of many court cases, and government attempts at resolution of existing and future cases.

To date, about 100 companies have declared bankruptcy at least partially due to asbestos-related liability. In accordance with Chapter 11 and § 524(g) of the U.S. federal bankruptcy code, a company may transfer its liabilities and certain assets to an asbestos personal injury trust, which is then responsible for compensating present and future claimants. Since 1988, 60 trusts have been established to pay claims with about $37 billion in total assets. From 1988 through 2010, analysis from the United States Government Accountability Office indicates that trusts have paid about 3.3 million claims valued at about $17.5 billion.

<doc id="424017" wikidata="Q432730" url="?curid=424017" title="Daniel Bensaïd">
<text>Daniel Bensaïd (25 March 1946 – 12 January 2010) was a philosopher and a leader of the Trotskyist movement in France. He became a leading figure in the student revolt of 1968, while studying at the University of Paris X: Nanterre.

== Life and career ==
Bensaïd was born in Toulouse, France, to a father who was a Sephardic Jew from Algeria, and who had moved from Oran, where he met Bensaïd&#x27;s mother, to Vichy Toulouse. In response to the 8 February 1962 Charonne massacre of Algerians in Paris, Bensaïd joined the Union of Communist Students. Irritated by the party orthodoxy he swiftly became part of a left opposition within the union, and was among the dissidents expelled from the party in 1966.

In 1966, Bensaïd began studying at the École normale supérieure de Saint-Cloud, where he helped found the &quot;Jeunesse Communiste Révolutionnaire&quot;, which became the Ligue Communiste Révolutionnaire (LCR). With Daniel Cohn-Bendit he helped to found the Mouvement du 22 Mars (Movement of 22 March), which was involved in the protests of May 1968 in France.

Bensaïd became a leading theorist of the LCR and the United Secretariat of the Fourth International, and a professor of philosophy at the University of Paris-VIII. He was also a Fellow at the International Institute for Research and Education. Upon his death, Tariq Ali described him as &quot;France&#x27;s leading Marxist public intellectual, much in demand on talkshows and writing essays and reviews in &quot;Le Monde&quot; and &quot;Libération&quot;.&quot; Bensaïd was known for his studies of Walter Benjamin and Karl Marx, and a recent analysis of French postmodernism.

He died of cancer on 12 January 2010 at the age of 63, arising from the side effects of drugs used to treat AIDS, which he had had for the previous 16 years.

== Criticism and debate ==
Bensaïd and the current of Trotskyism represented by the Unified Secretariat of the Fourth International have come under attack from more orthodox Trotskyists for the strategy they have advanced of entering the &quot;new social movements&quot;; in particular, for seeing reform and revolution as a false dichotomy, and proposing the formation of &quot;broad parties,&quot; rather than forming parties of the traditional Leninist type. In one such critique, Luke Cooper criticised Bensaïd for arguing that—in certain specific circumstances—it maybe permissible to enter a capitalist government, and seek to use the existing state as an instrument of revolutionary transformation. Bensaïd also debated revolutionary strategy with other Fourth International members, and the British Socialist Workers Party&#x27;s International Secretary Alex Callinicos.

<text>Merab Kostava () (May 26, 1939 – October 13, 1989) was a Georgian dissident, musician and poet; one of the leaders of the National-Liberation movement in Georgia. Along with Zviad Gamsakhurdia, he led the dissident movement in Georgia against the Soviet Union and was active in protests for an independent Georgia, until his death in a car crash in 1989.

==Life==
Kostava was born in 1939 in Tbilisi, of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, USSR (the current capital of Georgia). In 1954, Kostava and Zviad Gamsakhurdia founded the Georgian youth underground organization &quot;Gorgasliani,&quot; a tribute to Vakhtang Gorgasali, the medieval Georgian king who supposedly founded the capital, Tbilisi. Between 1956 and 1958 Kostava, together with Gamsakhurdia and several other members of this organization were jailed by the KGB for &quot;anti-Soviet activity.&quot; The charges against Kostava and Gamsakhurdia included the dissemination of anti-communist literature and proclamations.

Kostava graduated from the Tbilisi State Conservatoire in 1962. From 1962–1977 he was a teacher at a local music school in Tbilisi.

In 1973, Kostava and Gamsakhurdia established the Initiative Group for defence of Human Rights. In 1976 Kostava co-founded the Georgian Helsinki Group (later renamed the Georgian Helsinki Union in 1989). From 1976–1977 and 1987–1989 Kostava was a member of the Governing Board of the abovementioned human rights organization. After 1975 Kostava was a member of Amnesty International.

In 1977, Kostava and Gamsakhurdia were arrested and jailed, charged with spreading anti-Soviet propaganda, the result of them raising awareness about the systemic pillaging of Georgian church artifacts and the deportation and subsequent treatment of the Georgian Muslims. In 1978, Kostava and Gamsakhurdia were nominated to the Nobel Peace Prize by the Congress of the USA. They were sentenced to three years in prison and two years in exile to Siberia. Although Kostava was supposed to be released from prison in 1982, he was sentenced to additional three years in camp and two years in exile on 15 December 1981 in controversial circumstances for allegedly &quot;insulting an officer of the law&quot;. He was sent to Irkutsk to serve his sentence and began the hunger strike in protest, which in overall lasted for 13 monthes.

Kostava was released from prison in May, 1987. In 1988, he co-founded the Society of Saint Ilia the Righteous and was one of the leaders of this political pro-independence organization. From 1988–1989 he was one of the organizers and active participants of most (if not all) peaceful pro-independence political actions within the Georgian SSR. On April 9, 1989 Kostava was jailed again but was released after 45 days under public pressure.

Merab Kostava was active in the underground network of Samizdat publishers, co-publisher of the Georgian underground periodical &quot;Okros Satsmisi&quot; (&quot;The Golden Fleece&quot;). He was the author of many important literary and scientific works.

==Death==

On October 13, 1989, Merab Kostava died in a car crash near Boriti under suspicious circumstances. In 2013, he was posthumously awarded the title and Order of National Hero of Georgia.

==Remembrance==
There are streets named after Merab Kostava in Tbilisi, Batumi, Rustavi and Shindisi.

<text>Charles III has received numerous titles, decorations, and honorary appointments, as a member of the British royal family, as heir apparent to Elizabeth II, and as King of the United Kingdom and the 14 other Commonwealth realms.

==Royal and noble titles and styles==
Charles was originally styled as &quot;His Royal Highness Prince Charles of Edinburgh&quot; per letters patent issued by his grandfather George VI.

Upon the accession of his mother as queen, as the eldest son of the monarch, Charles automatically became, in England, the Duke of Cornwall and, in Scotland, the Duke of Rothesay, Earl of Carrick, Baron of Renfrew, Lord of the Isles, and Prince and Great Steward of Scotland. As such, he was styled &quot;His Royal Highness The Duke of Cornwall&quot;, except in Scotland, where he was known as &quot;His Royal Highness The Duke of Rothesay&quot; instead.

In 1958, letters patent from the then sovereign made Charles the Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester and, on 1 July 1969, he was invested as such during the a ceremony in which a coronet and robes were placed on him. In 2021, upon the death of his father, Prince Philip, Charles furthermore inherited the titles Duke of Edinburgh, Earl of Merioneth, and Baron Greenwich. When he became the British sovereign himself on 8 September 2022, these titles merged with the Crown.


===Regnal name===
In an announcement following the death of Queen Elizabeth II, Prime Minister Liz Truss referred to Charles as King Charles III, the first official usage of that name. Shortly afterwards Clarence House confirmed that he would use the regnal name &quot;Charles III&quot;.

There had previously been speculation that he might choose a different name, because the previous two monarchs named &quot;Charles&quot; are both associated with negative events in royal history: Charles I was beheaded in 1649 and Charles II reigned during the Great Plague and the Great Fire of London. The name &quot;Charles III&quot; is also associated with the Jacobite pretender, Charles Edward Stuart, who claimed the throne under that name in the 18th century. The most discussed alternative regnal name had been &quot;George VII&quot;, in honour of Charles&#x27; maternal grandfather; although, prior to succeeding to the throne, Charles denied discussing a regnal name at all.

=== Regnal style ===
Each Commonwealth realm acts as an independent monarchy but in a personal union, as such King Charles has different titles in each realm:

The King&#x27;s full British styles and titles were read out at the state funeral of his mother by David White, Garter Principal King of Arms, as follows:

&quot;Let us humbly beseech Almighty God to bless with long life, health and honour, and all worldly happiness the Most High, Most Mighty and Most Excellent Monarch, our Sovereign Lord, Charles III, now, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of His other Realms and Territories King, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith, and Sovereign of the Most Noble Order of the Garter.&quot;

=== Commonwealth ===
On 20 April 2018, the Commonwealth Heads of Government agreed that Charles would succeed his mother as Head of the Commonwealth, which he did on her death on 8 September 2022.

<doc id="424021" wikidata="Q734757" url="?curid=424021" title="Rilla of Ingleside">
<text>Rilla of Ingleside (1921) is the eighth and last novel in the &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; series by Lucy Maud Montgomery, but was the sixth &quot;Anne&quot; novel in publication order. This book draws the focus back onto a single character, Anne and Gilbert&#x27;s youngest daughter Bertha Marilla &quot;Rilla&quot; Blythe. It has a more serious tone, as it takes place during World War I and the three Blythe boys—Jem, Walter, and Shirley—along with Rilla&#x27;s sweetheart Ken Ford, playmates Jerry Meredith and Carl Meredith—end up fighting in Europe with the Canadian Expeditionary Force.

The book is dedicated: &quot;To the memory of FREDERICA CAMPBELL MACFARLANE who went away from me when the dawn broke on January 25, 1919—a true friend, a rare personality, a loyal and courageous soul.&quot; Frederica, Maud&#x27;s cousin and best friend, grew up in Park Corner, PEI, but died in the Spanish flu. Frederica may have been the model for Diana Barry, Anne of Green Gables&#x27; &quot;bosom friend&quot;: both had unusual, non-Christian first names, and the fictional Diana&#x27;s husband was named, perhaps not coincidentally, Fred.

&quot;Rilla of Ingleside&quot; is the only Canadian novel written from a woman&#x27;s perspective about the First World War by a contemporary. The novel is also groundbreaking as it is one of the first non-Australian texts to mention the Gallipoli campaign and the sacrifice made by the ANZACs.

At some point after Montgomery&#x27;s death in 1942, publishers quietly trimmed &quot;Rilla of Ingleside&quot; of a few thousand words, removing among other things passages containing historically accurate but now offensive anti-German sentiment. The trimmed version was the only available &quot;in print&quot; version for decades, until a new, restored and annotated edition of &quot;Rilla of Ingleside&quot;, edited by Benjamin Lefebvre (editor of Montgomery&#x27;s &quot;The Blythes Are Quoted&quot;) and Andrea McKenzie, was published by Viking Canada in October 2010.

==Plot summary==
Set almost a decade after &quot;Rainbow Valley&quot;, Europe is on the brink of the First World War, and Anne&#x27;s youngest daughter Rilla is an irrepressible almost-15-year-old, excited about her first adult party and blissfully unaware of the chaos that the Western world is about to enter. Her parents worry because Rilla seems not to have any ambition, is not interested in attending college, and is more concerned with having fun. Rilla was needlessly worried whether any boy would dance with her. Kenneth Ford dances with her, and they spend time together away from the crowd.

Once the Continent descends into war, Jem Blythe and Jerry Meredith promptly enlist, upsetting Anne, Nan, and Faith Meredith (whom Rilla suspects is engaged to Jem). Rilla&#x27;s brother Walter, who is of age, does not enlist, ostensibly due to a recent bout with typhoid but truly because he fears the ugliness of war and death. He confides in Rilla that he feels he is a coward. Rilla was a bit happy because she was closer to Walter than to her brother Jem.

The enlisted boys report to Kingsport for training. Jem&#x27;s dog, Dog Monday, takes up a vigil at the Glen train station waiting for Jem to come back. Rilla&#x27;s siblings Nan, Di, and Walter return to Redmond College, and Shirley returns to Queen&#x27;s Academy, leaving Rilla anxiously alone at home with her parents, their spinster housekeeper Susan Baker, and Gertrude Oliver, a teacher who is boarding with the Blythes while her fiancé reports to the front.

As the war drags on, Rilla matures, organizing the Junior Red Cross in her village. While collecting donations for the war effort, she comes across a house where a young mother has just died with her husband away at war, leaving no one to care for her two-week-old son. Rilla takes the sickly little boy back to Ingleside in a soup tureen, naming him &quot;James Kitchener Anderson&quot; after his father and, on the insistence of Susan, Herbert Kitchener, British Secretary of State for War. Rilla&#x27;s father Gilbert challenges her to raise the war orphan, and although she doesn&#x27;t like babies at all, she rises to the occasion, eventually coming to love &quot;Jims&quot; as her own. She also assists in the elopement of a soldier whose beloved is Miranda Pryor, the daughter of the town&#x27;s only vocal pacifist; the pacifist&#x27;s attempts to oppose fund-raising for the war effort or to criticize the war while leading prayers are a recurring minor storyline.

Rilla and her family pay anxious attention to all the war news as the conflict spreads and thousands die. Rilla grows much closer to Walter, who some townsfolk and fellow students have branded a slacker, an insult he feels deeply. Rilla feels that Walter finally regards her as a chum, not just as his little sister. Walter eventually does enlist, as does Rilla&#x27;s newfound love interest, Kenneth Ford (the son of Owen and Leslie Ford, who met in &quot;Anne&#x27;s House of Dreams&quot;), who kisses her before leaving and asks her to promise she will not kiss anyone else until he returns. She keeps this a secret for much of the book, unsure what it means about his feelings for her. Her mother later tells her that &quot;If Leslie West&#x27;s son asked you to keep your lips for him, I think you may consider yourself engaged to him.&quot; 

As the war continues, one night Dog Monday begins to howl inconsolably, leading the family to fear something terrible has happened to Jem. Instead, they receive news that Walter was killed in action at Courcelette. (In &quot;Anne of Ingleside&quot;, published in 1939 but set many years before &quot;Rilla of Ingleside&quot;, Montgomery foreshadows Walter&#x27;s death; Anne sees the shadow of a cross cast from the window over sleeping Walter&#x27;s head.) In Walter&#x27;s last letter to Rilla, written the day before his death, he tells her that he is no longer afraid and believes it may be better for him to die than to go on living with his memories of war forever spoiling life&#x27;s beauty. Rilla gives the letter to Una Meredith, as she has long believed Una had been in love with Walter, though she had never spoken of it to either of them. After Rilla had gone back to Ingleside that night, Una swore that she would not let love enter her life again.

Anne&#x27;s youngest son, Shirley, comes of age and immediately joins the flying corps. Susan was deeply touched when Shirley called her &quot;Mother Susan&quot; before he went. Jerry Meredith is wounded at Vimy Ridge, and in early May 1918, Jem is reported wounded and missing following a trench raid. The Blythes spend nearly five months not knowing Jem&#x27;s fate, but are encouraged by Dog Monday&#x27;s continued presence at the train station, as Susan reasons a dog so troubled by the death of his master&#x27;s brother surely would sense a tragedy involving his master. Finally the family receives a telegram: Jem had been taken prisoner in Germany, but eventually escaped to Holland and is now proceeding to England for medical treatment.

When the war finally ends, the rest of the boys from Glen St. Mary return home. Mary Vance and Miller Douglas announce plans to marry, with Miller deciding to pursue a career in Mr. Flagg&#x27;s store after losing a leg in the war. Jem returns on an afternoon train and is met by a joyful Dog Monday. Jims&#x27; father returns with a young merry English bride and takes Jims to live with them nearby; Rilla is glad she can still remain part of Jims&#x27; life.

Life after war resumes. Jem plans to return to college, since he and Faith cannot be married until he finishes studying medicine. Faith, Nan, and Diana plan to teach school, while Jerry, Carl, and Shirley will return to Redmond, along with Una, who plans to take a Household Science course. Noting that Kenneth Ford has survived the war but has not contacted her, Rilla concludes that his interest must have faded and she should consider joining the college-bound group. Una and Walter share a romantic bond that Montgomery hints at, but their story is cut short by his death.

Finally, Kenneth returns home and proposes to Rilla with the question &quot;&quot;Is&quot; it Rilla-&quot;my&quot;-Rilla?&quot;—to which Rilla lisps, &quot;Yeth,&quot; a rare slip into her childhood habit.

==Series==
Montgomery continued the story of Anne Shirley in a series of sequels. They are listed in the order of Anne&#x27;s age in each novel.

<doc id="424022" wikidata="Q8024486" url="?curid=424022" title="Windrow composting">
<text>In agriculture, windrow composting is the production of compost by piling organic matter or biodegradable waste, such as animal manure and crop residues, in long rows – windrow.

As the process is aerobic, it is also known as Open Windrow Composting (OWC) or Open Air Windrow Composting (OAWC). 

This method is suited to producing large volumes of compost. These rows are generally turned to improve porosity and oxygen content, mix in or remove moisture, and redistribute cooler and hotter portions of the pile. Windrow composting is a commonly used farm scale composting method. Composting process control parameters include the initial ratios of carbon and nitrogen rich materials, the amount of bulking agent added to assure air porosity, the pile size, moisture content, and turning frequency. The temperature of the windrows must be measured and logged constantly to determine the optimum time to turn them for quicker compost production.

==Compost windrow turners==

Compost windrow turners were developed to produce compost on a large scale by Fletcher Sims Jr. of Canyon, Texas. They are traditionally a large machine that straddles a windrow of or more high, by as much as across. Although smaller machines exist for small windrows, most operations use large machines for volume production. Turners drive through the windrow at a slow rate of forward movement. They have a steel drum with paddles that are rapidly turning. As the turner moves through the windrow, fresh air (oxygen) is injected into the compost by the drum/paddle assembly, and waste gases produced by bacterial decomposition are vented. The oxygen feeds the aerobic bacteria and thus speeds the composting process.

;Utilization
To properly use a compost windrow turner, it is ideal to compost on a hard surfaced pad. Heavy-duty compost windrow turners allow the user to obtain optimum results with the aerobic hot composting process. By using four wheel drive or tracks the windrow turner is capable of turning compost in windrows located in remote locations. With a self-trailering option this allows the compost windrow turner to convert itself into a trailer to be pulled by a semi-truck tractor. These two options combined allow the compost windrow turner to be easily hauled anywhere and to work compost windrows in muddy and wet locations.

==Specific applications==
Molasses-based distilleries all over the world generate large amount of effluent termed as spent wash or vinasse. For each liter of alcohol produced, around 8 liters of effluent is generated. This effluent has chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 1,50,000 PPM and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of 60,000 PPM and even more. This effluent needs to be treated and the only effective method for conclusive disposal is by composting.

Sugar factories generate pressmud / cachaza during the process and the same has about 30% fibers as carbon and has large amounts of water. This pressmud is dumped on prepared land in the form of 100 meters long windrows of 3 meters x 1.5 meters and spent wash is sprayed on the windrow while the windrow is being turned. These machines help consume spent wash of about 2.5 times of the volume of the pressmud, which means that 100 meters of windrow accommodates about 166 MT of pressmud and uses about 415 m³ of spent wash in 50 days.

Microbial Culture (organic solution) TRIO COM-CULT is used about 1 kg per MT of pressmud for fast de-composing of the spent wash. Hundreds of thousands of square meters of spent wash is being composted all over the world in countries like India, Colombia, Brazil, Thailand, Indonesia, South Africa etc.

The compost yard has to be prepared in such a way that the land is impervious and does not allow the liquid effluent to pass down into the earth. The compost thus generated is of excellent quality and is rich in nutrients.

<text>The prime minister of Czechoslovakia (, ) was the head of government of Czechoslovakia, from the creation of the First Czechoslovak Republic in 1918 until the dissolution of the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic on 1 January 1993.

During periods when the post of the president of Czechoslovakia was vacant, the prime minister took on most presidential duties. However, the Czechoslovak constitutions do not define anything like a post of acting president.

<doc id="424030" wikidata="Q7083917" url="?curid=424030" title="Old English Bible translations">
<text>The Old English Bible translations are the partial translations of the Bible prepared in medieval England into the Old English language. The translations are from Latin texts, not the original languages.

Many of these translations were in fact Bible glosses, prepared to assist clerics whose grasp of Latin was imperfect and circulated in connection with the Vulgate Latin Bible that was standard in Western Christianity at the time. Old English was one of very few early medieval vernacular languages the Bible was translated into, and featured a number of incomplete Bible translations, some of which were meant to be circulated, like the Paris Psalter or Ælfric&#x27;s Hexateuch.

== Early history (600-874) ==
Information about translations is limited before the Synod of Whitby in 664. Aldhelm, Bishop of Sherborne and Abbot of Malmesbury (639–709), is said to have written an Old English translation of the Psalms, although this is disputed.

Cædmon (~657–684) is mentioned by Bede as one who sang poems in Old English based on the Bible stories, but he was not involved in translation &quot;per se&quot;.

Bede (&quot;c.&quot; 672–735) produced a translation of the Gospel of John into Old English, which he is said to have prepared shortly before his death. This translation is lost; we know of its existence from Cuthbert of Jarrow&#x27;s account of Bede&#x27;s death.

The &quot;Vespasian Psalter&quot; (~850–875) is an interlinear gloss of the Book of Psalms in the Mercian dialect. Eleven other Anglo-Saxon (and two later) psalters with Old English glosses are known. The earliest are probably the early-9th-century red glosses of the Blickling Psalter (Morgan Library &amp; Museum, M.776). The latest Old English gloss is contained in the 12th-century Eadwine Psalter. The Old English material in the Tiberius Psalter of around 1050 includes a continuous interlinear gloss of the psalms.

== Alfred and the House of Wessex (875-999) ==

As England was consolidated under the House of Wessex, led by descendants of Alfred the Great and Edward the Elder, translations continued. King Alfred (849–899) circulated a number of passages of the Bible in the vernacular. These included passages from the Ten Commandments and the Pentateuch, which he prefixed to a code of laws he promulgated around this time. Alfred is also said to have directed the Book of Psalms to have been translated into Old English, though scholars are divided on Alfredian authorship of the Paris Psalter collection of the first fifty Psalms.

In approximately 990, a full and freestanding version of the four Gospels in idiomatic Old English appeared in the West Saxon dialect and are known as the &quot;Wessex Gospels&quot;. Seven manuscript copies of this translation have survived. This translation gives us the most familiar Old English version of , the Lord&#x27;s Prayer:
::&quot;Fæder ure þu þe eart on heofonum, si þin nama gehalgod. To becume þin rice, gewurþe ðin willa, on eorðan swa swa on heofonum. Urne gedæghwamlican hlaf syle us todæg, and forgyf us ure gyltas, swa swa we forgyfað urum gyltendum. And ne gelæd þu us on costnunge, ac alys us of yfele. Soþlice.&quot;

==Gospels from the South, East and North==

Between 950 and 970, Aldred the Scribe added a gloss in the Northumbrian dialect of Old English (the &quot;Northumbrian Gloss on the Gospels&quot;) to the &quot;Lindisfarne Gospels&quot; as well as a foreword describing who wrote and decorated it. Its version of The Lord&#x27;s Prayer is as follows:
::&quot;Suae ðonne iuih gie bidde fader urer ðu arð ðu bist in heofnum &amp; in heofnas; sie gehalgad noma ðin; to-cymeð ric ðin. sie willo ðin suae is in heofne &amp; in eorðo. hlaf userne oferwistlic sel us to dæg. &amp; forgef us scylda usra suae uoe forgefon scyldgum usum. &amp; ne inlæd usih in costunge ah gefrig usich from yfle&quot;

At around the same time (~950–970), a priest named Farman wrote a gloss on the Gospel of Matthew that is preserved in a manuscript called the &quot;Rushworth Gospels&quot;.

At about the same time as the Wessex Gospels (~990), the priest Ælfric of Eynsham produced an independent translation of the Pentateuch with books of Joshua and Judges. His translations were used for the illustrated Old English Hexateuch.

Seemingly unrelated to Ælfric&#x27;s translation are two versions of the Gospels:

* The three related manuscripts, Royal 1 A. xiv at the British Library, Bodley 441 and Hatton 38 at the Bodleian Library, are written in Old English, with a least one manuscript being produced in the late 12th century. Hatton 38 is noted as being written in the latest Kentish form of West Saxon. They cover the four Gospels, with one section (Luke 16.14–17.1) missing from both manuscripts, Hatton and Royal.

* Three other manuscripts and five fragments also contain text of Old English Gospels, not necessarily the same recension, from the late 900s.

== Late Anglo-Saxon translations (after 1000) ==
The Junius manuscript (initially ascribed to Cædmon) was copied about 1000. It includes Biblical material in vernacular verses: Genesis in two versions (&quot;Genesis A&quot; and &quot;Genesis B&quot;), &quot;Exodus&quot;, &quot;Daniel&quot;, and &quot;Christ and Satan&quot;, from the apocryphal Gospel of Nicodemus.

In 1066, the Norman Conquest marked the beginning of the end of the Old English language. Translating the Bible into Old English gradually ended with the movement from Old English to Middle English, and eventually there were attempts to provide Middle English Bible translations.

<doc id="424033" wikidata="Q899498" url="?curid=424033" title="Cucumber Castle">
<text>Cucumber Castle is the seventh studio album by the Bee Gees, released in April 1970. It was produced by Barry Gibb, Maurice Gibb, and Robert Stigwood. It consists of songs from their television special of the same name, which was named after a song on their 1967 album &quot;Bee Gees&#x27; 1st&quot;. &quot;Cucumber Castle&quot; is the only Bee Gees album not to feature any recorded contributions from Robin Gibb, as he had left the group before the album was recorded. (He did receive co-composer credit on one track, which was written before his departure.)

&quot;Cucumber Castle&quot; was the last Bee Gees album with drummer Colin Petersen, who was fired during the recording of the album. Pentangle drummer Terry Cox played on the remaining tracks.

This album contained the hit single &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget to Remember&quot; which hit No. 2 in the UK in August 1969, going virtually head to head with Robin Gibb&#x27;s solo single &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;, which had reached number No. 2 the previous month. The album struggled to make an impact and stalled at number 57 in the UK and number 94 in the US. Indeed, it was the last Bee Gees album to chart in the UK until &quot;Spirits Having Flown&quot; in 1979 (though the soundtrack for &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;, which featured six contributions from the group as well as two additional songs that they wrote that other artists performed, topped the UK album chart in 1978).

==Background==
On 19 March 1969, Robin Gibb announced his solo career, while the Bee Gees recorded three songs &quot;Tomorrow Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Sun in My Morning&quot; and &quot;Ping Pong&quot; (unreleased). Maurice recalls,

&quot;Since Robin left, Barry and I are a lot closer, we&#x27;re working much more together. We&#x27;re having a ball, we can bring anyone we like into things. I did the majority of the backings anyway, even when Robin was with us, but there&#x27;s more work for me now. I&#x27;m bringing me out more – I do six leads on the next album; before I think I only sang three all told. I write soft, and Barry keeps telling me to write harder music. I&#x27;m progressing more to the arranging side and Barry is getting more ideas-wise, he&#x27;s freer with his words. At the moment, we&#x27;ll go on as a three-piece [group], and if we find someone suitable to take Robin&#x27;s place, we&#x27;ll take him in, we&#x27;ve only seen two people. We&#x27;re getting tapes from Wapping and Nottingham and Stoke and all over, but we want to get someone who can sing nice. We can take care of the hair and the clothes and all that. We&#x27;re not looking for a copy of Robin though&quot;.

==Production==
On 7 May 1969, the Bee Gees recorded &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget to Remember&quot;. The other songs recorded around May were &quot;I Lay Down and Die&quot;, &quot;Give a Hand, Take a Hand&quot; (not released at the time but recorded by the Staple Singers in 1971 and re-recorded by the reformed Bee Gees for the 1974 album &quot;Mr. Natural&quot;) and &quot;Bury Me Down By the River&quot;. At the time the band was considering a replacement for Robin. As Dave Dee recalls, &quot;[Barry] was looking for a replacement and I found him one, A guy called Peter Mason, he was a Scouser, but he lived in Salisbury where we lived. Barry was looking for somebody who had a similar voice sound but also wrote&quot;. Peter Mason did audition and recorded vocals on a few of the songs to be included on the Cucumber Castle album but those were either erased or left out of the final mix. Mason is unable to verify if his voice is on &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget to Remember&quot;. Mason believes that it was Robert Stigwood wanting to reunite the three brothers that kept him from joining the Bee Gees, in spite of the fact that Barry had welcomed him on board and even bought him a suit for performing in.

In June, Barry produced &quot;The Love of a Woman&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Let It Happen Again&quot; performed by Samantha Sang, the orchestral arrangement was credited to Bill Shepherd. Also in that month, Barry produced P.P. Arnold&#x27;s version of &quot;Give a Hand, Take a Hand&quot;, around the same time, the Bee Gees recorded the unreleased &quot;Between the Laughter and the Tears&quot;. On 13 June, Maurice produced Tin Tin&#x27;s &quot;Tuesday Dreamer&quot;, &quot;Swans on the Canal&quot; and &quot;Spanish Shepherd&quot;, . On 9 July 1969, Barry produced P.P. Arnold&#x27;s version of &quot;Bury Me Down By the River&quot; and &quot;Let There Be Love&quot;. Also in July, the Bee Gees continued recording eight songs for the film of the same name. Filming started on 11 August 1969. Also on July, Maurice played all the instruments on the song &quot;My Thing&quot;, which was sung by him. In August 1969, Maurice Gibb, Steve Groves, Steve Kipner and Billy Lawrie recorded &quot;Have You Heard the Word&quot; under the name The Fut. The song was released as a single in 1970.

The Bee Gees returned to the studio in September 1969 to record seven songs including the unreleased &quot;One Bad Thing&quot; and &quot;The Day Your Eyes Meet Mine&quot;. Both songs were later re-recorded for what was intended to be Barry&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;The Kid&#x27;s No Good&quot;. In October, the Bee Gees recorded two songs, around the same time as they re-recorded &quot;I.O.I.O.&quot;, a song from 1968. On 16 October, the last album session, they recorded the unreleased track &quot;Julia&quot;, which was sung by Maurice. On 31 October, Gibb produced the two Samantha Sang songs and on November, Gibb produced P.P. Arnold songs &quot;Piccaninny&quot;, &quot;High and Windy Mountain&quot; and a cover version of &quot;Turning Tide&quot;. Also in November, Gibb produced Tin Tin&#x27;s three songs.

During much of this time, Maurice Gibb was also producing the debut album by Australian duo Tin Tin.

Shortly after Petersen&#x27;s departure, Barry reminded everyone, &quot;Maurice is capable of playing about seven instruments - most of the back tracks on the records were all him, and I sang lead on four or five of the hit singles. So how can the Bee Gees sound be finished?&quot;. Nevertheless, Barry and Maurice drifted apart shortly afterwards and both recorded unreleased solo albums. The brothers would reunite as a trio in 1970.

==Recording &amp; Release==
Around the same time in 1969, Barry and Maurice planned a series of performances as a gratitude to their fans who had supported the Bee Gees through all the tumult as Barry reveals, &quot;We want to go out on a concert tour of Britain before Christmas with a big orchestra&quot;. But on 1 December 1969, Barry announced his departure from the band saying &quot;As from today, I&#x27;m solo&quot; while Maurice recorded songs for his debut solo album &quot;The Loner&quot;. Barry would spend the following months writing new material for his solo album, &quot;The Kid&#x27;s No Good&quot;.

By February 1970, Barry started to record songs for the album. He continued it in March, while Maurice continued working with Billy Lawrie. In April 1970, Maurice recorded &quot;Leave Me Here to Linger with the Ladies&quot; for &quot;Sing a Rude Song&quot;. Also in April, Barry continued to produce songs for P.P. Arnold. The last day on which P.P. Arnold recorded his song, which was produced by Barry was on 10 June 1970. &quot;Cucumber Castle&quot; was released around April 1970.

&quot;Cucumber Castle&quot; reached No. 9 in Italy behind &quot;Led Zeppelin II&quot; by Led Zeppelin (#7) and &quot;McCartney&quot; by Paul McCartney (#8), the number one LP at that time was The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Let It Be&quot;.

<doc id="424034" wikidata="Q5613723" url="?curid=424034" title="Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport (1933–2004)">
<text>Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport , formerly known as Canton Civil Airport (White Cloud) or Pai Yuen Airport, was an airport that served Guangzhou, the capital of South Central China&#x27;s Guangdong province. Originally opened in 1933, it was one of the first civil airports in China, but was closed on 5 August 2004 when all services were transferred to the new airport of the same name, to the north.

== History ==
The airport started construction in 1932 and opened in November 1933. During the Canton Operation, the Japanese Navy invaded the airport and expanded the runway. In 1963, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force moved away from the airport, making the airport only for public use. The name of the airport is changed to &quot;Baiyun&quot; named from nearby Baiyun Mountain (&quot;Baiyun&quot; in Chinese means &quot;white cloud&quot;).

From 1964 to 1967, it underwent a comprehensive expansion, adding an area of , and extending the runway to from before it had the conditions of further navigation with foreign countries.
In the 1980s, the airport renovated and expanded facilities such as oil storage depots, aprons, terminal buildings, boarding bridges, and maintenance hangars to meet the standards of international first-class airports. After the Reform and Opening-up, Baiyun Airport had developed rapidly. Its passenger capacity, takeoffs and landings had ranked first in mainland China for eight consecutive years. After several expansions, it was still far from meeting its demand. It was imperative to choose a new location to build a new airport.

In 1992, the airport underwent civil aviation system reform, and the airport operated as an independent economic entity.

By 2002, the passenger throughput of the old Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport had reached 16,014,400 passengers, and the cargo and mail throughput reached 592,600 tons.

Due to the expansion of Guangzhou, the airport was surrounded by high-rise buildings and was unable to expand further to meet passengers’ needs. Instead, the new Baiyun airport was built and opened on 5 August 2004, and the old airport was closed.

== Former airlines and destinations ==
There are often ferry international flights to Hong Kong, even before its economic open up. Similar to its new airport, it had served a variety of domestic or foreign international airlines back in the 1980s and 1990s such as Pakistan International Airlines, Garuda Indonesia, Air France, Japan Air System, Japan Airlines, All Nippon Airways, Malaysia Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Lufthansa, Philippine Airlines, Thai Airways International, Dragonair, Singapore Airlines, Aeroflot, Baikal Airlines, Royal Air Cambodge, and nearly every domestic airlines.

== Legacy ==
The former terminal of the airport is being converted into a large shopping mall. The northern portion of the former airport is being turned into a provincial- and city-level functional area integrating conference services. The southern portion will be converted into Guangzhou&#x27;s secondary center integrating retail, sports facilities, business, and cultural activities.


== Incidents and accidents ==

*On the 24December 1982, CAAC Flight 2311, an Ilyushin Il-18B was destroyed by fire after landing at the airport. Twenty-five of the 69 people on board were killed.
*On 2October 1990, Xiamen Airlines Flight 8301, a Boeing 737-247, was hijacked on route to Guangzhou from Xiamen. While landing at the airport, it sideswiped a parked China Southwest Airlines Boeing 707-3J6B, and crashed into a taxiing China Southern Airlines Boeing 757-21B; of the total 225 occupants involving the aircraft, 97 survived.

<doc id="424037" wikidata="Q2658711" url="?curid=424037" title="Unity of the Brethren Baptists">
<text>Unity of the Brethren Baptists in the Czech Republic (), is a Baptist Christian denomination in Czech Republic. It is affiliated with the Baptist World Alliance. The headquarters is in Prague.

==History==

Baptist work in the territory of the present Czech Republic began in the 1850s. The area was part of Austria-Hungary until the end of World War I, and was known as Czechoslovakia from 1918 until 1992. In 1858 Magnus Knappe, a German minister, began to travel regularly to the Broumov area and preach to the German-speaking people there. The first Czech Baptist congregation was established on March 15, 1884 in the village of Hledsebe in Central Bohemia. This body called itself the &quot;Congregation of Christians Baptized in Faith&quot;. This work moved to Prague and continued to grow, and other works were established. Meeting in Vavrišovo in 1919, 15 Baptist congregations formed an association with the name &quot;The Chelčicky Unity of the Brethren&quot;. Later the name &quot;The Chelčicky Unity of the Brethren Baptists&quot; replaced the original, and in the early 1950s it was changed to &quot;The Unity of the Brethren Baptists&quot;. Though in the 1960s two regional groups (Bohemian-Moravian and Slovak) were formed, the Unity included all Baptists in the territory of Czechoslovakia until 1993. After Czechoslovakia was split into two republics on January 1, 1993, the &quot;Unity of the Brethren Baptists&quot; was divided on January 1, 1994, forming the &quot;Unity of the Brethren Baptists in the Czech Republic&quot; and the &quot;Unity of the Brethren Baptists in the Slovak Republic&quot;. These two bodies maintain fellowship, use the same hymn book, and publish a common magazine, the &quot;Rozsievač&quot; (meaning &quot;The Sower&quot;). In 2019, some churches left the union for theological reasons and founded the &quot;Fellowship of Baptist Churches&quot;. According to a census published by the association in 2023, it claimed 2,298 members and 43 churches.

==Beliefs==
The &quot;Unity of the Brethren Baptists&quot; is a member of the European Baptist Federation, the Baptist World Alliance, and the &quot;Ecumenical Council of Churches in the Czech Republic&quot;.

The &quot;Unity of the Brethren Baptists&quot; is a Trinitarian body, holding a belief in one God - the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. The highest example, criteria and authority is Jesus. The Scriptures of the Old and the New Testaments are held to be the word of God - God&#x27;s revelation of Jesus Christ. Salvation comes to persons who exercise faith in Jesus Christ as their Savior, which is prerequisite to becoming church members. Baptism of believers is performed by immersion in water. Since each person is believed to be responsible to God, the &quot;Unity of the Brethren Baptists&quot; practice and defend liberty of conscience of everyone. Local congregations should be independent and autonomous, but not isolated from other Baptist congregations.

==Governance==
The highest body in the &quot;Unity of the Brethren Baptists&quot; is a &quot;convention of delegates&quot;, which generally holds sessions once a year. The Convention elects a five-member executive committee for a four-year term, which functions in matters of administration.

==Schools==
The college or Bible school in Olomouc (founded 1992) offers a three-year study, focusing on theological activities. Those who are interested in specific theological degrees often study at the &quot;Evangelic Theological Seminary&quot; in Prague.

<doc id="424038" wikidata="Q763956" url="?curid=424038" title="Pontifical High Mass">
<text>A Pontifical High Mass, also called Solemn Pontifical Mass, is a Solemn or High Mass celebrated by a bishop using certain prescribed ceremonies. Although in modern English the word &quot;pontifical&quot; is almost exclusively associated with the pope, any bishop may be properly called a pontiff. Thus, the celebrant of a Pontifical High Mass may be the pope, any bishop or any other prelate who is allowed to wear pontificals.

==Origins==
In the early Church, Mass was normally celebrated by the bishop, with other clergy. In the Roman Rite this evolved into a form of Solemn High Mass celebrated by a bishop accompanied by a deacon, subdeacon, assistant deacons, thurifer, acolyte(s) and other ministers, under the guidance of a priest acting as master of ceremonies. Most often the specific parts assigned to deacon and subdeacon are performed by priests. The parts to be said aloud are all chanted, except that the prayers at the foot of the altar were said quietly by the bishop with the deacon and the subdeacon, while the choir sang the Introit.

The full Pontifical High Mass is carried out when the bishop celebrates the Mass at the &quot;cathedra&quot; in his own cathedral church, or with permission at the throne in another diocese.

A Low Mass celebrated by a bishop is almost identical with one celebrated by a priest, except that the bishop puts on the maniple only after the prayers at the foot of the altar, uses the greeting &quot;Pax vobis&quot; (&quot;Peace to you&quot;) rather than the priest or deacon&#x27;s &quot;Dominus vobiscum&quot; (&quot;The Lord be with you&quot;), and makes the sign of the cross three times at the final blessing, which may be preceded by a formula that begins with &quot;Sit nomen Domini benedictum&quot; (&quot;Blessed be the name of the Lord&quot;).

==Differences from ordinary Solemn Mass==
===Celebration by a bishop other than the pope===
In contrast to celebration by a priest, a bishop celebrates almost the entire first half of the Solemn High Mass at the &quot;cathedra&quot;, often referred to as his throne (to the left of the altar), until the offertory. Instead of saying &quot;Dominus vobiscum&quot; (&quot;The Lord be with you&quot;) as the opening liturgical greeting for the Eucharistic part of the Mass, a bishop says &quot;Pax vobis&quot; (&quot;Peace to you&quot;).

A bishop also wears additional vestments to those of a priest. Unless specifically mentioned, the following vestments are normally worn in the Ordinary Form of the Mass celebrated by a bishop:
* The dalmatic, the distinctive vestment of a deacon, worn under the bishop&#x27;s chasuble to show that he has the full powers of the sacrament of Holy Orders.
* For the Extraordinary Form, in addition to the dalmatic, the tunicle, the particular vestment of the subdeacon, worn under the bishop&#x27;s dalmatic, further to show the fullness of the major orders. Since the 19th century it looks almost exactly the same as the dalmatic.
* The mitre, the bishop&#x27;s headdress.
* The crosier, the bishop&#x27;s hooked staff.
* Episcopal buskins along with episcopal sandals, a specially decorated form of footwear in the shape of slippers, may be worn in the Extraordinary Form of Mass.
* A pectoral cross.
* Liturgical gloves are worn in the Extraordinary Form of Mass. 
* A metropolitan archbishop celebrating Mass within the area of his province over which he has jurisdiction wears a pallium over the chasuble, as a sign of the special authority over the suffragan bishops, granted by the Pope. The metropolitan archbishop does not need the permission of one of his suffragan bishops to celebrate Mass in one of the suffragan&#x27;s churches or even the cathedral, but he will usually do so as a sign of respect. In a similar case is used the rationale if allowed.

In the Extraordinary Form, when the bishop sits at the cathedra, a special silk cloth, called a gremiale, of the same liturgical colour as the bishop&#x27;s vestments is placed in his lap.

===Papal Mass===

The Pope&#x27;s Pontifical High Mass, when celebrated with full solemnity, was even more elaborate. As is still done in papal Masses on occasions such as the inauguration of a pontificate, the Gospel and Epistle were sung not only in Latin by a Latin Church deacon and subdeacon, but also in Greek by Eastern clergy, wearing the vestments of their own rite and observing its customs, such as placing the deacon&#x27;s stole on the Gospel Book and bowing rather than genuflecting. This custom stresses the unity of the universal Catholic Church, formed by both the Eastern and the Western (Latin Church) Churches in full communion.

At the elevations of host and chalice, the Silveri symphony was played on the trumpets of the no longer existing Noble Guard. Through a misunderstanding of the name Silveri, English speakers sometimes referred to this as the sounding of silver trumpets. An asterisk – a common eucharistic implement in the Eastern Rites, in which it is shaped differently from the twelve-ray asterisk that was used in Papal Masses – was used to cover the host on the paten, when it was brought to the Pope at his throne for communion. The Pope drank the Precious Blood, the wine having been consecrated, through a golden tube. Even for the laity, the use of a tube is one of the four ways envisaged in the 1970 revision of the Roman Missal for receiving Communion from the chalice, cf. also &quot;General Instruction of the Roman Missal&quot;, 248–250. It was also customary for some of the bread and wine used at the Mass to be consumed by the sacristan and the cup-bearer in the presence of the Pope at the offertory and again before the Our Father (&quot;Pater noster&quot;) in a short ceremony called the &quot;praegustatio&quot; as a precaution against poison or invalid matter.

==Anglican use of the term==
In the Anglo-Catholic tradition of Anglicanism, the term &quot;Pontifical High Mass&quot; may refer to a Mass celebrated with the traditional Tridentine ceremonies described above. Liturgical manuals such as &quot;Ritual Notes&quot; provide a framework for incorporating Tridentine ceremonial into the services of the Book of Common Prayer. More generally, the term may refer to any High Mass celebrated by a bishop, usually in the presence of his throne. The Pontifical High Mass is one of four full-form pontifical functions, the other three being pontifical Evensong, High Mass in the presence of a greater prelate, and Solemn Evensong in the presence of a greater prelate. In its more traditional form, the ministers required at the service are a deacon and subdeacon of the Mass, assistant deacons in dalmatics, and an assistant priest in cope and surplice, who acts as the episcopal chaplain, along with the usual servers.

<doc id="424040" wikidata="Q6245783" url="?curid=424040" title="John M. Dowd">
<text>John Maguire Dowd (born November 2, 1941) is an American attorney, former attorney for the United States Department of Justice, and former Marine Corps Judge Advocate. Dowd was employed by several law firms in the Washington, D.C. area for his expertise in defending clients accused of white-collar crimes. He was appointed by Major League Baseball (MLB) to lead the special counsel in multiple investigations with the organization in the 1980s and 1990s involving sports betting and bribery, the most notable investigation being the &quot;Dowd Report&quot; in 1989, which resulted in Pete Rose being banned from baseball for life.

From June 2017 to March 2018, Dowd was a legal advisor to President Donald Trump. On March 22, 2018, Dowd resigned as Trump&#x27;s lead counsel in the special counsel investigation into Russian election interference and possible ties to Trump associates.

==Early life==
Dowd was born in Brockton, Massachusetts, to parents Mary and Paul Dowd. As a boy, he became fascinated with the writings of attorney Clarence Darrow. During the summers, Dowd worked at Sankaty Head Golf Club on Nantucket Island where he became acquainted with trial attorney Edward Bennett Williams. Dowd received his B.A. &quot;cum laude&quot; from then St. Bernard College in 1963 and J.D. from Emory University School of Law in 1965. From 1965 to 1969, Dowd served in the Judge Advocate Division and was promoted to the rank of captain.

==Department of Justice==
Dowd joined the Department of Justice in 1969. Working for the Department of Justice, Dowd was a trial attorney for the tax division and later as a chief of an Organized Crime Strike Force from 1974 to 1978. His early career at the Department of Justice involved working on the tax evasion case of mobster Meyer Lansky, the prosecution of Small Business Administration bribery cases in Virginia, and internal investigations involving financial corruption by Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) officials. One internal investigation of FBI officials in particular dealt with former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover that began in 1976, four years after his death. Dowd stated in a 1993 interview on &quot;Frontline&quot; that the investigation revealed, &quot;Hoover had taken, at taxpayers&#x27; expense, goods and services provided by employees of the FBI.&quot;

Dowd also helped implement and trained FBI officers and U.S. Attorneys&#x27; offices the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). The first case that tested the strength of the RICO laws was tried by Dowd.

In 1977 and 1978, Dowd led an investigation of Pennsylvanian Congressman Daniel J. Flood. Dowd questioned Flood&#x27;s former aide, Steve Elko, who accused Flood on a number of federal contracts in exchange for cash kickbacks and also mentioned Pennsylvanian Congressman Joshua Eilberg&#x27;s law firm handling the contract negotiations for a federal grant to Hahnemann University Hospital. The discovery of evidence involving Congressman Eilberg coincided with the firing of U.S. Attorney, David W. Marston. Dowd was then assigned to investigate Eilberg while the Flood investigation later expanded to include RICO violations.

Dowd was considered a candidate to be a U.S. Attorney for the eastern district of Virginia in 1978, but he was never appointed by President Jimmy Carter.

In April 1979, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reporter Jim Drinkhall, wrote an article accusing federal prosecutors Dowd and William M. Kramer of developing and implementing an unethical plan to force a convicted felon, Samuel Ray Calabrese, to cooperate with the government against other organized crime figures. Following its publication, the Department of Justice launched an investigation that ultimately cleared Dowd and Kramer of wrongdoing. Drinkhall later published a second article in December 1979 where he accused Dowd and Kramer of investigating him. Dowd and Kramer filed a libel suit against Dow Jones for $5 million and it was settled for $800,000 in 1984 before going to trial.

==Legal career==
Following his departure at the Department of Justice in 1978, Dowd was hired by the law firm Whitman &amp; Ransom as a partner in their Washington, D.C. office to represent defendants accused of white-collar crimes. He exited Whitman &amp; Ransom to join Heron, Burchette, Ruckert &amp; Rothwell in 1984. Dowd left Heron Burchette in 1990 and joined Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld where he later became a partner. Dowd has set up his own practice, John M. Dowd, in Washington, D.C.

===Robert Reckmeyer===
Dowd represented Robert Reckmeyer in a 1985 federal trial for distribution of illegal drugs. Reckmeyer pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 17 years in prison, but later it was reduced to 14 years. Later reduced to 8 years and 2 months for good behavior, released on November 2, 1992. Reckmeyer petitioned to vacate his sentence making the accusation that Dowd had requested and knowingly accepted illegally sourced funds as fees for his services. The grand jury brought no charges against Dowd and no action was taken by the District of Columbia Bar. Reckmeyer appealed the case to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals which affirmed the lower court&#x27;s decision and later denied an en banc.

===Iran–Contra affair===
During the Iran–Contra affair, Dowd represented Colonel Robert C. Dutton, a former Air Force officer and an associate to Major General Richard Secord, who oversaw the contra air supply effort.

===John McCain===
Dowd represented Arizona Senator John McCain during the Senate Ethics Investigation known as the Keating Five in hearings held in 1990 and 1991. John McCain was cleared for impropriety by the Senate committee, but was reprimanded and criticized for his poor judgment.

===ADM===
Akin Gump was retained by Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) during the lysine price-fixing conspiracy to develop a defense strategy following the FBI raid of ADM&#x27;s offices in June 1995. For four hours, Dowd interviewed employee Mark Whitacre, who at the time was an informant for the FBI. Whitacre told Dowd about his role as an informant and Dowd immediately informed ADM&#x27;s management, who in retaliation, accused Whitacre of embezzlement. In the film, &quot;The Informant!&quot;, which is based on the lysine price-fixing conspiracy, Dowd was portrayed by stand-up comedian Bob Zany.

===Fife Symington===
Arizona governor Fife Symington retained Dowd as an adviser when he faced questioning from United States House Committee on Financial Services over the Savings and loan crisis in the late-1980s and early-1990s on using his position improperly to access loans with favorable terms. Dowd represented Symington during the latter&#x27;s trial for extortion and bank fraud in 1996 and 1997, of which he was convicted for bank fraud. Symington was convicted on 7 of the 21 counts and acquitted on 3, with the other 11 resulting in a hung jury. His conviction was reversed by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2000. Symington was later pardoned by President Bill Clinton in 2001. Symington had once saved an intoxicated 19 year old Bill Clinton from a rip tide off of Massachusetts.

===Monica Goodling===
Dowd represented Monica Goodling in the dismissal of U.S. attorneys overseen by Attorney General, Alberto Gonzales. Goodling was advised by Dowd to invoke the fifth and avoid testifying to Congress about the firing of eight U.S. attorneys. Dowd said that the investigation was &quot;hostile&quot;. Goodling took his advice. As a result, the Committee obtained an immunity order from the Chief Judge, USDC DC directing her to testify. Ms. Goodling testified in public pursuant to the Court&#x27;s order. The Chairman of the Committee said Goodling&#x27;s testimony was the most honest and complete he had ever heard.

===Raj Rajaratnam===
Dowd defended hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam, founder of the Galleon Group, in his insider trading case. Dowd flipped off a photographer in May 2011 following Rajaratnam&#x27;s conviction.

===Donald Trump===
From June 2017 until March 2018, Dowd was a personal attorney representing President Donald Trump in the special counsel investigation into possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. Dowd recommended to President Trump that attorney Ty Cobb be added to his legal team to manage matters with the special counsel.

On December 2, 2017, the day after Mike Flynn plead guilty in federal court and agreed to cooperate with the special counsel&#x27;s investigation, controversy erupted over Trump&#x27;s tweeting about firing Flynn. It was reported Dowd had drafted the tweet that stated Trump had to fire General Flynn after he lied to the vice president and the FBI. Dowd did not comment, and referred reporters to fellow Trump attorney Ty Cobb&#x27;s statement; however, Cobb said nothing about lying to the FBI being a factor in Flynn&#x27;s firing. Legal commentators quickly raised the question of whether, in fact, Trump knew Flynn lied to the FBI when he fired him in February 2017. Ten days prior on November 22, Dowd sent a voicemail to Rob Kelner, an attorney of Mike Flynn, in which Dowd asked for a &quot;heads up&quot; of where the special counsel&#x27;s probe was headed. The Department of Justice released a transcript of the voicemail on May 31, 2019.

On March 22, 2018, Dowd resigned as Trump&#x27;s lead attorney in the Russia inquiry. Dowd cited Trump&#x27;s repeatedly ignoring advice, clashing over legal strategy, and the recent hire of attorney Joseph diGenova to the legal team as justification for his resignation, while Trump cited his lack of confidence in Dowd to handle the investigation.

===Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman===
Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman retained the services of Dowd in October 2019. President Trump consented to allow Dowd to represent them as evidenced in an email from Counsel to the President Jay Sekulow. The email was given to the US House of Representatives by Parnas. Dowd emailed the House Intelligence Committee that they would not comply with an October 7 deadline to hand over documents concerning an impeachment inquiry of President Trump. The two men had previously peddled information to President Trump&#x27;s attorney, Rudy Giuliani, about Ukrainian corruption involving Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton. On October 9, Fruman and Parnas were arrested and indicted for funneling foreign money into U.S. elections. Parnas severed ties with Dowd the following month in preparation to comply with requests for record and testimony into the impeachment inquiry.

==Baseball investigations==

Dowd was the Special Counsel to the Commissioner of Baseball that led to the banning of MLB player and manager Pete Rose for the Cincinnati Reds. In his role as Special Counsel to the Commissioners, Peter Ueberroth and subsequently A. Bartlett Giamatti, he submitted a 225-page report in May 1989, which detailed Rose&#x27;s betting on baseball games in the 1980s. The report led to Rose&#x27;s being placed on baseball&#x27;s ineligible list in August 1989, even though &quot;no evidence was discovered that Rose bet against the Reds&quot; according to Dowd. Dowd mentioned in a 2002 ESPN interview that he &quot;probably did&quot;. Rose later filed a defamation suit against Dowd in July 2016 after comments Dowd made in a radio interview in mid-2016 alluding to Rose engaging in statutory rape. A sworn statement was filed in July 2017 in Dowd&#x27;s defense alleging that Rose had a sexual relationship with a minor. The case was dismissed in December 2017 after both parties settled out of court for undisclosed terms.

In addition to investigating Rose, Dowd scrutinized several members of MLB for betting. Dowd investigated outfielder Lenny Dykstra over allegations of betting on baseball games in 1991. Dykstra was cleared, but admonished for his gambling addiction. Manager Don Zimmer and two umpires, Rich Garcia and Frank Pulli, were given two years probation in 1989 for sports betting. The investigation was kept secret until 2002 when the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; disclosed it.

At the request of Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent, Dowd was assigned to compile a report on New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner&#x27;s $40,000 payment to Howard Spira to dig up dirt on outfielder Dave Winfield in 1990. His work led to Vincent banning Steinbrenner&#x27;s day-to-day operations of the Yankees on July 30, but was later sued by Yankees&#x27; minority owners Harold M. Bowman and Daniel R. McCarthy. The suit where Bowman and McCarthy sought $30,000 in damages from Dowd was thrown out in court in early 1991 by District Judge Robert W. Sweet.

During the Mitchell Report, which looked into the culture of steroid abuse in MLB, Dowd brought up allegations against former Maine Senator George J. Mitchell about the independence of the probe. It was after the release of the report that Dowd was convinced that Mitchell had done a good job.

==Personal life==
Dowd is married to Carole Dowd (née Folts) and resides in Chatham, Massachusetts. They have three sons: Daniel, Michael and Thomas and two daughters: Anne and Sarah.

<doc id="424059" wikidata="Q5256002" url="?curid=424059" title="Demographics of Czechoslovakia">
<text>Czechoslovakia had a peak population of 15.6 million, mainly composed of Czechs, Slovaks, Hungarians, Romani people, Silesians, Ruthenians, Ukrainians, Germans, Poles and Jews. The ethnic composition of Czechoslovakia changed over time from Sudeten Germans being the most prominent ethnicity to Czechs and Slovaks making up two-thirds of the demographic. Amongst this demographic there was also a diverse range of religions with Roman Catholic being the most prominent. This population has been found to have had an increasing growth rate that had a declining trajectory. The population density was approximately 121 persons per square kilometre with the highest population density being in Moravia of 154 persons per square kilometre.

==Population==
As of 1991, Czechoslovakia had a population of 15.6 million, of which by ethnicity 62.8% were Czechs (including Moravians), 31% Slovaks, 3.8% Hungarians, 0.7% Roma, and 0.4% Silesians. Smaller groups of Rusyns, Ukrainians, Germans, Austrians, Poles and Jews (the post-Holocaust community) combined made up the remaining 1.6% of the population.

===Population growth rate===
The population growth rate was 2.7% in 1985, falling to 1.7% in 1990. Its decreasing tendency was sharper in the Czech Republic than in Slovakia. In 1989 life expectancy was 67.7 years for men and 75.3 years for women. About 23.1% of the population was under the age of 15, and 19% was over the age of 60.

===Population density===
The population density in 1986 was approximately 121 persons per square kilometer. The most densely settled geographic region was Moravia, which had around 154 persons per square kilometer. The figure for Bohemia was around 120, and for Slovakia, around 106. The major cities and their estimated populations in January 1986 were as follows:
*Prague (ČSR) 1.2 million (1.85 million in Metropolitan area)
*Bratislava (SSR) 417,103
*Brno (ČSR) 385,684
*Ostrava (ČSR) 327,791
*Košice (SSR) 222,175
*Plzeň (ČSR) 175,244
Czechoslovakia remained essentially a society of small cities and towns, in which about 65% of the population were classified as urban dwellers.

==Ethnic composition==
Czechoslovakia&#x27;s ethnic composition in 1987 offered a stark contrast to that of the First Republic (see History). The Sudeten Germans that made up the majority of the population in border regions were forcibly expelled after World War II, and Carpathian Ruthenia (poor and overwhelmingly Ukrainian and Hungarian) had been ceded to the Soviet Union following World War II. Czechs and Slovaks, about two-thirds of the First Republic&#x27;s population in 1930, represented about 94% of the population by 1950, with Hungarians as the third largest group.

Following the expulsion of the ethnic German population from Czechoslovakia, parts of the former Sudetenland, especially around Krnov and the surrounding villages of the Jesenik mountain region in northeastern Czechoslovakia, were settled in 1949 by Communist refugees from Northern Greece who had left their homeland as a result of the Greek Civil War. These Greeks made up a large proportion of the town and region&#x27;s population until the late 1980s/early 1990s. Although defined as &quot;Greeks&quot;, the Greek Communist community of Krnov and the Jeseniky region actually consisted of an ethnically diverse population, including Greek Macedonians, Slavo-Macedonians, Vlachs, Pontic Greeks and Turkish speaking Urums or Caucasus Greeks.

The aspirations of ethnic minorities had been the pivot of the First Republic&#x27;s politics. This was no longer the case in the 1980s. Nevertheless, ethnicity continued to be a pervasive issue and an integral part of Czechoslovak life. Although the country&#x27;s ethnic composition had been simplified, the division between Czechs and Slovaks remained; each group had a very similar history, but sometimes divergent aspirations.

From 1950 through 1983, the Slovak share of the total population increased steadily. The Czech population as a portion of the total declined by about 4%, while the Slovak population increased by slightly more than that. The actual numbers did not imperil a Czech majority; in 1983 there were still more than two Czechs for every Slovak. In the mid-1980s, the respective fertility rates were fairly close, but the Slovak fertility rate was declining more slowly.

*History of Czechoslovakia (1918–1938)
*History of Czechoslovakia (1948–1989)

== Religious affiliations in 1930 ==
Czechoslovakia had the following religious proportion of the population at the time:

* Roman Catholic - 73.5%
* Protestants - 7.67%
* Czechoslovak Hussite Church 5.39%
* Greek and Armenian Catholics 3.97%
* Jews - 2.42%
* Orthodox - 0.99%
* No affiliation - 5.8%

<text>The Battles of Barfleur and La Hougue took place during the Nine Years&#x27; War, between 19 May O.S. (29 May N.S.) and 4 June O.S. (14 June N.S.) 1692. The first was fought near Barfleur on 19 May O.S. (29 May N.S.), with later actions occurring between 20 May O.S. (30 May N.S.) and 4 June O.S. (14 June N.S.) at Cherbourg and Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue in Normandy, France.

The French attempt to restore James II to the English throne—the Williamite War in Ireland—ended in defeat in October 1691. Instead, a fleet of 44 ships of the line under Admiral de Tourville was to transport an invasion force commanded by Bernardin Gigault de Bellefonds. The Anglo-Dutch ships wintered in separate ports, and Tourville was ordered to put to sea as early as possible, hoping to intercept them before they could combine. However, when he finally did so in late May, the two fleets under Admiral Edward Russell had already met up and were 82 strong when they encountered the French off Cape Barfleur.

Following his instructions, Tourville attacked and inflicted numerous casualties to the Anglo-Dutch crews, but, after a clash that left many ships on both sides damaged, he ultimately disengaged. The Anglo-Dutch fleet pursued the outnumbered French into the harbours of Cherbourg and La Hougue, destroying a total of fifteen ships and ending the threat to England.

==Background==
The French victory at the battle of Beachy Head two years earlier, in June 1690, had opened up the possibility of destroying a significant part of the Anglo-Dutch fleet and landing an invading army at Great Britain. King Louis XIV and his naval minister, Louis Phélypeaux, planned to land an army in England and restore James II to the throne. They planned to launch the invasion in April 1692, which was earlier than the separate English and Dutch fleets were expected to put to sea and combine. Much of the invasion force was to be made up of the Irish Royal Army which had gone into exile in the Flight of the Wild Geese after the siege of Limerick in 1691.

Troops were collected at Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue. The cavalry and guns were to be loaded into transports at Le Havre. The French commander Admiral Anne Hilarion de Tourville was to bring the French fleet up from Brest, collect the transports and the troops, then fight off the English fleet and land the army in England. Despite Tourville being in command of the fleet, strategic decisions were to be taken by James II, François d&#x27;Usson de Bonrepaus and Bernardin Gigault de Bellefonds.

However, the French fleet was unable to concentrate in time. D&#x27;Estrees and the Toulon fleet were beaten back at the Strait of Gibraltar, losing two ships in a storm, and Villette Mursay with the Rochefort squadron was delayed. Tourville&#x27;s Brest fleet was undermanned, and when he sailed, on , he was forced to leave 20 ships under François Louis Rousselet de Châteaurenault behind. His fleet was further delayed by adverse winds, and did not clear Berteaume Roads until 12 May.

Tourville entered the English Channel with 37 ships of the line, accompanied by seven fireships, plus frigates, scouts, and transports. He was joined on 15 May by Villette and the Rochefort squadron, seven ships of the line and attendant vessels, giving Tourville a combined fleet of 44 ships plus attendant vessels, 70 or 80 sail altogether. Meanwhile, the allied fleet was assembling at St Helens on the Isle of Wight. Vice Admiral of the Red Sir Ralph Delaval arrived on 8 May. Next day he was joined by Richard Carter, who had been in the western channel guarding a convoy, and delivering troops to Guernsey. The Dutch had despatched a fleet, under Philips van Almonde, from the Texel in April, which was making its way south. Admiral of the Blue Sir John Ashby sailed from the Nore on 27 April.

Admiral of the Fleet Edward Russell was delayed until 29 April, but gained time by making a risky passage through the Gull channel. He met Almonde at the Downs and a further Dutch squadron at Dungeness, arriving at St Helens in the second week of May. More detachments joined over the next few days, and by 14 May, Russell had a force of over 80 ships of the line, plus auxiliaries. Thus by 14 May, the allied fleet was fully assembled and the French strategic aim of acting with a concentrated force while the allies were scattered was already lost. However, Louis XIV had furnished Tourville with strict orders to seek battle, strong or weak (&quot;fort ou faible&quot;), and this he proceeded to do.

==Battle==

The fleets sighted each other at first light on 19 May, off Cap Barfleur. The story that Tourville then held a conference with his officers, whose advice, and his own opinion, was against action seems inaccurate in view of Tourville&#x27;s strict orders from the king to engage. He had also been advised by James II&#x27;s envoys to expect some defections by English captains with Jacobite sympathies, though none in fact did so. The fleets slowly closed in the light southwesterly breeze: Russell from the northeast, and Tourville, who had the weathergage, from the south, on a starboard tack to bring his line of battle into contact with Russell&#x27;s. Both fleets were in three squadrons, each split into three divisions and commanded by a flag officer.

Owing to the calm conditions, it was not until after 10:00, four hours after first sighting each other, that the two fleets engaged. As long as he held the weathergage Tourville was able to break off the engagement when he had carried out his orders to damage the enemy. He had reinforced his centre, the White squadron under his own command, in order to engage Russell&#x27;s Red squadron with close to equal numbers. Elsewhere, he sought to minimise damage by extending and refusing the van, to avoid them being turned and overwhelmed, while the rear was held back to keep the weathergage. Russell countered by holding fire as long as possible, to allow the French to come closer. Almonde, in the van, extended to try to overlap the French line, while Ashby, with the rear and some way off, sought to close and bring his Blue squadron into action. From around 11:00, and for the next few hours, both fleets bombarded each other, causing considerable damage.

The battle continued for the rest of the day and into the night, and was full of incident. At 13:00, a change in the wind allowed Rear Admiral of the Red Sir Cloudesley Shovell to break the French line and the Dutch to start enveloping the French van. A flat calm descended at 16:00, leaving both fleets in a fog. At 18:00, Tourville was able to use the tide to gain a respite, and Shovell used the same tide at 20:00 for a fireship attack.

By 18:00, the battle was almost over. Surprisingly, though most ships on both sides were damaged, some severely, no ships from either battle line were lost. At the turn of the tide, Tourville again took advantage of this to cut cables and be carried down channel on the ebb, away from the scene of battle. Russell also cut when he realised what had happened, in order to give chase into the night. On 30 May, the French withdrawal was hampered by wind and tide and by the fact that, due to cost concerns by the French Naval Ministry, many of the ships had anchors inadequate to withstand the strong tidal races in the region. The nearest French port, Cherbourg was not fortified.

===Pursuit===
First light on 20 May saw the French fleet scattered into groups across a wide area. To the north of the battle scene, and heading northward, were Gabaret and Langeron, with four ships between them. They skirted the English coast later that day, and headed out into the Atlantic. Eventually they would arrive safely at Brest. To the south, Nesmond was heading south-east towards the Normandy coast with six ships. Two of these would be beached at Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue, while another two would later put into Le Havre, one of which, &quot;L’Entendu&quot;, was wrecked at the harbour entrance. Nesmond, with the remaining two ships &quot;Monarque&quot; and &quot;Aimable&quot;, passed through the Strait of Dover, went north around Britain and finally arrived safely at Brest. Heading west was the main body in three groups: Villette leading with fifteen ships, followed by d’Amfreville with twelve, and Tourville bringing up the rear with seven. The French were able to close up during the day, but Tourville was hampered by his efforts to save his flagship, &quot;Soleil Royal&quot;, which was in a pitiable condition. He recognised this later that day, and transferred his flag to &quot;L’Ambiteux&quot;.

On 21 May, the French fleet was anchored against the tide off Cap de la Hague. The leading contingent, twenty-one ships, now under Pannetier, had rounded the cape and was in the Alderney Race, while the remainder, thirteen with Tourville and the other flag officers, were to the east. As the weather deteriorated, these ships began to drag their anchors and were forced to cut and run before the wind and tide. Russell pursued Tourville eastward along the Cotentin coast. Tourville, without anchors, was unable to do more than beach his ships. Three of the most badly damaged were forced to beach at Cherbourg. The rest, ten ships, reached St Vaast la Hougue where they too were beached, joining the two of Nesmond&#x27;s division that were already there. Russell and the ships with him, together with some of Ashby&#x27;s Blue squadron, also cut to pursue him, while Ashby and Almonde continued to shadow Pannetier&#x27;s group.

Pannetier, in order to escape the pursuing allied fleet, sought to make the hazardous passage through the Alderney Race. In this he was helped by finding in his crew a local man, Hervé Riel, to act as pilot when his navigators demurred. Almonde and Ashby did not try to follow him. They were criticised later by Russell for not doing so, although the only flag officer who knew the waters, Carter, had died of his wounds. Almonde attempted pursuit by taking his squadron west of Alderney, but the delay allowed Pannetier to pull too far ahead, and Almonde abandoned the chase. Pannetier later reached Saint-Malo and safety, while Almonde and Ashby turned east to rejoin Russell at La Hougue.

The &quot;Soleil Royal&quot;, &quot;Admirable&quot;, and were in such bad shape they had to be beached at Cherbourg. They were destroyed there the next day, 23 May, by Vice-Admiral Delaval, attacking from long boats and with fireships. Meanwhile, Russell had turned on the remaining ships. These had sought refuge at La Hougue where they would be under the protection of the assembled land forces and a battery. On 3 June and 4 June, the Dutch and English attacked with long boats. By this time, the French crews were exhausted and disheartened. The allies successfully deployed shore parties and fireships that burnt all twelve French ships of the line which had sought shelter there. This last action became celebrated in England as the Battle of La Hougue.

==Aftermath==
The dispersal of the French fleet put an end to the invasion plans, and the Allied victory was commemorated in England by a Fleet Review. Following the battle, the French abandoned the idea of seeking naval superiority for its own sake, adopting instead a continental strategy on land and pursuing a war against trade at sea. The battle is seen differently on either side of the English Channel. The English have seen the action as a single action over six days; it has often been referred to as the battle of La Hougue, or simply Hougue. On the other hand, the French have seen the various actions as separate battles, of Barfleur, Cherbourg and La Hougue. However, more neutral observers, such as Mahan, have also seen the action as a whole, as does Pemsel, and naval actions over a period of days were not unusual for the time.

Each side regards the outcome differently. The English claim this as an outright victory. The French, while acknowledging La Hougue and Cherbourg as defeats, prefer to claim Barfleur as a victory. The English view of this as an out-and-out victory, while plausible tactically, is flawed strategically. In earlier times it was widely celebrated, though by Mahan&#x27;s time it was seen as less important. The French invasion plan was foiled, but La Hougue was not the devastating blow to the French Navy it was once thought. French losses were quickly made good, and by the following year Tourville was able to inflict a defeat on the Allies in the battle of Lagos. Although the French dropped their invasion plans for the rest of the conflict and switched to a &quot;guerre de course&quot;, this was a matter of policy rather than necessity.

However, the French view of the action at Barfleur as a victory is similarly flawed. The actions at Cherbourg and La Hougue can only be seen as defeats, but the view of the action at Barfleur as a victory is not tenable. The strategic aim, to concentrate the fleet and seize control of the channel before the allied fleet had assembled, had already failed by 14 May, and the chance for invasion was lost even if the battle had never taken place. Tactically Tourville made the best he could of a difficult situation. He made skilled use of the tides, first to disengage his fleet and, later to escape, but with no ships lost on either side and the action ending with Russell in hot pursuit, it can be seen at best as inconclusive. Nevertheless, historians have generally acknowledged the skill, bravery, courage and ferocious fighting ability of the French in this action. Barfleur remains an action which is celebrated in France, while the English complained of a lack of spirit among their captains and two lieutenants were court martialled and dismissed from the navy for retreating from the battle after their captains were incapacitated.

<text>The Department for the Protection of Public Safety and Order (), usually called the Guard Department () and commonly abbreviated in modern English sources as the Okhrana () was a secret police force of the Russian Empire and part of the police department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) in the late 19th century and early 20th century, aided by the Special Corps of Gendarmes.

==Overview==
Formed to combat political terrorism and left-wing politics and revolutionary activity, the Okhrana operated offices throughout the Russian Empire, as well as satellite agencies in a number of foreign countries. It concentrated on monitoring the activities of Russian revolutionaries abroad, including in Paris, where Okhrana agent Pyotr Rachkovsky (1853–1910) was based 1884–1902 before he returned to service in Saint Petersburg 1905–1906.

The Okhrana deployed multiple methods, including covert operations, undercover agents, and —the reading of private correspondence. The Okhrana&#x27;s Foreign Agency also monitored revolutionary activity. The Okhrana became notorious for its agents provocateurs, including Jacob Zhitomirsky (born 1880, a leading Bolshevik and close associate of Vladimir Lenin), Yevno Azef (1869–1918), Roman Malinovsky (1876–1918) and Dmitry Bogrov (1887–1911).

The Okhrana tried to compromise the labour movement by setting up police-run trade unions, a practice known as &quot;zubatovshchina&quot;. The Communists blamed the Okhrana in part for the Bloody Sunday event of January 1905, when Tsarist troops killed hundreds of unarmed protesters who were marching during a demonstration organized by Father Gapon.) and with the participation of Pyotr Rutenberg.

Many historians, such as the German Konrad Heiden and the Russian historian Mikhail Lepekhine maintain that Matvei Golovinski, a writer and Okhrana agent, fabricated the first edition of &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot; (1903). The organization also fabricated documentation connected with the antisemitic Beilis trial of 1913.

Suspects captured by the Okhrana were passed to the judicial system of the Russian Empire.

The Okhrana was perpetually underfunded and understaffed; before 1914 it had just 49 employees split between seven offices and never had more than 2,000 informants at any one time. It never received more than 10% of the total police budget.

===Use of torture===
Despite the reforms
in the early 19th century, the practice of torture was never truly abolished. Possibly, the formation of the Okhrana led to increasing use of torture, due to the Okhrana using methods such as arbitrary arrest, detention and torture to gain information. Claims persisted the Okhrana had operated torture chambers in places like Warsaw, Riga, Odessa and most of the urban centres.

==History==
Forerunners of the Okhrana as a Russian security service included the Secret Prikaz () (1654–1676), the (1686–1726), the (1731–1762), the (1762–1801), and the Third Section of His Imperial Majesty&#x27;s Own Chancellery (1826–1880).

The first special security department was the Department on Protecting the Order and Public Peace under the Head of St. Petersburg, set up in 1866 after a failed assassination attempt on Emperor Alexander II, with a staff of 12 investigators. Its street address, Fontanka, 16, was publicly known in the Russian Empire. After another failed assassination attempt, on August 6, 1880, the Emperor, acting on proposals made by Count Loris-Melikov, established the Department of State Police under Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and transferred part of the Special Corps of Gendarmes and the Third Section of the Imperial Chancellery to the new body. The position of Chief of Gendarmes was merged with that of the Minister, and Commander of the Corps was assigned as a Deputy of the Minister. Still, these measures did not prevent the assassination of Alexander II in March 1881.

In an attempt to implement preventive security measures, Emperor Alexander III () immediately set up two more Security and Investigation (охранно-розыскные) secret-police stations, supervised by Gendarme officers, in Moscow and Warsaw; they became the basis of the later Okhrana. The Imperial Gendarmerie still operated as security police in the rest of the country through their Gubernial and Uyezd Directorates. The Emperor also established the Special Conference under the MVD (1881), which had the right to declare a State of Emergency Security in various parts of the Empire (which was actively used in the time of 1905 Revolution) and subordinated all of the imperial police forces to the Commander of the Gendarmes (1882).

The rise of the socialist movements led to the integration of security forces. From 1898 the Special Section (Особый отдел) of the Department of Police succeeded the Gendarmes in the role of gaining information from domestic and foreign agents and &quot;&quot;. Following the Socialist-Revolutionary Party&#x27;s assassination of MVD Minister Dmitry Sipyagin on April 2, 1902, the new Minister Vyacheslav von Plehve gradually relieved the Directorates of Gendarmes of their investigation power in favor of Security and Investigation Stations (Охранно-розыскное отделение) under respective Mayors and Governors (who as a matter of fact were subordinate to the MVD Minister).

===Pre-1905===
The Okhrana used many seemingly unorthodox methods in the pursuit of its mission to defend the Tsarist monarchy; indeed, some of the Okhrana&#x27;s activities even contributed to the wave of domestic unrest and revolutionary terror that they were intended to quell. Perhaps most paradoxical of all was the Okhrana&#x27;s collaboration with revolutionary organizations. Early Okhrana agents to work alongside revolutionaries included Lieutenant-Colonel Georgy Sudeykin of the St. Petersburg Special Section, who, in 1882, set up an illegal printing operation to publish the revolutionary People&#x27;s Will literature with Okhrana funds. Sudeykin and his colleague, a revolutionary-turned-police-informant named Sergey Degayev, passed drafts of the publication through Okhrana censors before printing. This episode marked the beginning of the Okhrana&#x27;s efforts to surreptitiously observe, but also influence and undermine, revolutionary movements. This focus on infiltrating and influencing revolutionary groups, rather than merely identifying and arresting their members, intensified with the innovations of one Okhrana bureau chief, Sergey Zubatov. While P.I. Rachkovsky, as head of the Okhrana&#x27;s Foreign Agency, had long ordered Okhrana agents to infiltrate and influence revolutionary movements abroad, Zubatov brought these tactics to a new level by setting up Okhrana-controlled trade unions, the foundation of police socialism. Perhaps recognizing the same discontent among factory workers that the Bolsheviks sought to exploit to start a revolution, Zubatov hoped the unions would mollify factory workers with improvements in working conditions and thus prevent workers from joining revolutionary movements that threatened the monarchy. To this end, Zubatov set up the Moscow Mechanical Production Workers&#x27; Mutual Aid Society in May 1901. After Zubatov became head of the Special Section in 1902, he expanded his trade unions from Moscow to St. Petersburg and to Southern Russia. 
Zubatovite trade unions achieved moderate success at channeling workers&#x27; political agitations away from revolutionary movements and toward labor improvements, especially in the cities of Minsk and Odessa, with one high-ranking official noting that many revolutionaries and workers were joining the unions. However, Zubatov, if not police socialism, became discredited in the summer of 1903 after the Okhrana officer in charge of the Odessa union allowed a strike to get out of hand, causing a mass movement which paralyzed the region. Although the police-run unions continued to operate after Zubatov&#x27;s ousting, without Okhrana funding, they proved more a liability than an asset. The Assembly of Working Men, a police-run union with about 6,000–8,000 members, formed by the alleged Okhrana agent Father Georgy Gapon, sparked the Bloody Sunday massacre of January 1905, a milestone in the Revolution of 1905 when union members marched peacefully on the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg and were fired upon by Imperial soldiers. The Okhrana complemented police socialism and other projects to prevent the conditions in which revolutionary movements could take hold by pursuing initiatives to curtail the activities of existing organizations. Yevno Azef, the notorious Okhrana provocateur who became the head of the Socialist Revolutionary Fighting Organization (SRFO), epitomized the Okhrana&#x27;s inscrutable practice of revolutionary-group infiltration. While the Okhrana managed to imbed many of its agents in revolutionary organizations, the police preferred to slowly gather intelligence and to attempt to interfere with revolutionary work surreptitiously rather than to arrest known revolutionaries immediately. This policy led to numerous dubious acts on the part of police spies, who needed to participate in revolutionary activities to avoid suspicion, as when Yevno Azef, as head of the SRFO, ordered the assassination of V. K. Plehve on July 15, 1904.

===The Revolution of 1905===
For over twenty years, the Okhrana had focused on interfering with the activities of relatively small, and distinct, revolutionary groups. The Revolution of 1905, characterized by seemingly spontaneous marches and strikes, exposed the Okhrana&#x27;s inefficacy at controlling mass popular movements. Not only did the Okhrana lack the capacity to prevent the mass movements of 1905, or even to contain them once they began, the Okhrana&#x27;s misguided attempts may even have worsened the unrest. D. F. Trepov, the Assistant Minister of the Interior in charge of police affairs, and P. I. Rachkovsky, now in charge of all domestic political-police operations, attempted to mount an aggressive offensive against those they believed to be responsible for the unrest, namely &quot;zemstvo&quot; employees, in May 1905, but backed down three months later. In October of that year, Trepov again attempted a violent repression of the revolution, only to call off the effort for lack of manpower. Since these attempts at repression never reached fruition, they only served to aggravate the already enraged Russian populace and to deepen their distrust of the Imperial government. Trepov&#x27;s replacement by P.N. Durnovo in late-October ushered in a period of even more vicious repression of the revolutionaries. Indicative of this new period is the head of the St. Petersburg Special Section, A.V. Gerasimov&#x27;s, strike on the St. Petersburg Soviet. To Emperor Nicholas II&#x27;s delight, Gerasimov arrested delegates of the Soviet &quot;en masse&quot; on December 3, 1905. Along with this repression and the end of the Revolution of 1905 came a shift in the political police&#x27;s mentality; gone were the days of Nicholas I&#x27;s white-gloved moral police: post-1905 the political police feared that the Russian people were as eager to destroy them as to depose the Emperor.

Following the outbreak of the 1905 Revolution and assassination of Plehve, Pyotr Stolypin, as the new MVD Minister and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, set up a nationwide net of Security Stations. By 1908 there were 31 Stations, and more than 60 by 1911. Two more Special Sections of the Department of Police were organized in 1906. The centralized Security Section of the Department of Police was created on February 9, 1907; it was located at 16, Fontanka, St. Petersburg.

The exposure of Yevno Azef (who had organized many assassinations, including that of Plehve) and Dmitri Bogrov (who assassinated Stolypin in 1911) as Okhrana double agents put the agency&#x27;s methods under great suspicion; the organisation was further compromised by the discovery of many similar double agents-provocateur. In Autumn 1913, all of the Security Stations except the original Moscow, St Petersburg and Warsaw ones were dismissed. The start of World War I in 1914 marked a shift from anti-revolutionary activities of the Department of Police to counter-intelligence; however, the efforts of the department were poorly synchronised with counter-intelligence units of the General Staff and of the Army.

===The 1917 Russian Revolution (February Revolution and October Revolution)===

Just as the Okhrana had once sponsored trade unions to divert activist energy from political causes, so too did the secret police attempt to promote the Bolshevik party, as the Bolsheviks seemed a relatively harmless alternative to more violent revolutionary groups. Indeed, to the Okhrana, Lenin seemed to actively hinder the revolutionary movement by denouncing other revolutionary groups and refusing to cooperate with them.

To aid the Bolsheviks at the expense of other revolutionaries, the Okhrana helped Roman Malinovsky (a police spy who had managed to rise within the Bolshevik hierarchy and gain Lenin&#x27;s trust) in his bid to become a Bolshevik delegate to the Duma in 1912. To this end, the Okhrana sequestered Malinovsky&#x27;s criminal record and arrested other candidates for the seat.

According to the transcribed recollections of Nikolay Vladimirovich Veselago, a former Okhrana officer and relative of the director of the Russian police department Stepan Petrovich Beletsky, both Malinovsky and Joseph Stalin reported on Lenin as well as on each other although Stalin was unaware that Malinovosky was also a penetration agent.

Malinovsky won the seat and led the Bolshevik delegation in the Fourth Duma until 1914, but even with the information Malinovsky and other informants provided to the Okhrana, the police were unprepared for the rise of Bolshevism in 1917. Although the secret police had agents within the Bolshevik organization, other factors contributed to the Okhrana&#x27;s inefficacy at averting the events of 1917. Among these factors was the ban on police spies within the military promulgated by the Deputy Minister of the Interior Vladimir Dzhunkovsky, who found the practice dishonorable and damaging to morale. While the beginning of World War I in 1914 moved the Okhrana&#x27;s attentions initially from countering revolutionaries to countering German espionage, the focus quickly shifted back as it emerged that the Germans were heavily funding Russian revolutionary groups in order to destabilize the Russian Empire.

Despite the renewed attention, the Russian Revolution of 1917 took the secret police, and the country, by surprise. Indeed, the Okhrana&#x27;s persistent focus on revolutionary groups may have resulted in the secret police not fully appreciating the deep-seated popular unrest brewing in Russia.

The revolutionaries identified the Okhrana as one of the main symbols of Tsarist repression, and its headquarters were sacked and burned on 27 February 1917. The newly formed Provisional Government then disbanded the whole organization and released most of the political prisoners held by the Tsarist regime. Revelations of the Okhrana&#x27;s earlier abuses heightened public hostility towards the secret police after the 1917 February Revolution and made it very dangerous to be a political policeman. That fact, along with the St. Petersburg Soviet&#x27;s insistence on the dissolution of the regular Tsarist police force, as well as of the political police, meant that the Okhrana quickly and quietly disappeared.

=== Successor organisations ===
Some Okhrana functionaries continued their activities in the civil-war period (1917–1923) within the White Armies, notably in the ().

After the 1917 October Revolution, the government of the RSFSR under Vladimir Lenin replaced the Okhrana with a Soviet security organisation – the much larger and more efficient Cheka in December 1917, supplemented by the GRU (military intelligence) from October–November 1918. The Cheka and its successor organizations (notably the GPU and the OGPU) eventually became the KGB (1954–1991) after the death of the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in March 1953. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991 the KGB split into the FSK (later reorganized into the FSB in 1995) and the SVR.

<text>The president of Czechoslovakia (, ) was the head of state of Czechoslovakia, from the creation of the First Czechoslovak Republic in 1918 until the dissolution of the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic on 1 January 1993.

In periods when the presidency was vacant, most presidential duties were assumed by the prime minister.

The second section lists the leaders of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSČ) from 1948 to 1989. The post was titled as chairman from 1948 to 1953, first secretary from 1953 to 1971, and general secretary from 1971 to 1989. After the 1948 coup d&#x27;état, the KSČ&#x27;s leader was the country&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; chief executive. However, three party leaders (Klement Gottwald, Antonín Novotný, and Gustáv Husák) also served as president at some point in their tenures.

<doc id="424086" wikidata="Q2464180" url="?curid=424086" title="SS Jeremiah O'Brien">
<text>SS &quot;Jeremiah O&#x27;Brien&quot; is a Liberty ship built during World War II and named after the American Revolutionary War ship captain Jeremiah O&#x27;Brien (1744–1818).

Now based in San Francisco, she is a rare survivor of the 6,939-ship 6 June 1944 D-Day armada off the coast of Normandy, France.

Of the 2,710 Liberty ships that were built, only the &quot;Jeremiah O&#x27;Brien&quot; and the (both operational as of 2024) and the (a static museum ship) are still afloat.

==History==

===World War II===
&quot;Jeremiah O&#x27;Brien&quot; is a class EC2-S-CI ship, built in just 56 days at the New England Shipbuilding Corporation in South Portland, Maine and launched on 19 June 1943. Deployed in the European Theater of Operations, she made four round-trip convoy crossings of the Atlantic and was part of the Operation Neptune invasion fleet armada on D-Day. She made 11 cross-channel round-trips to support the invasion. Following this she was sent to the Pacific Theater of Operations and saw 16 months of service in both the South Pacific and Indian Ocean calling at ports in Chile, Peru, New Guinea, the Philippines, India, China, and Australia.

===Postwar===
The end of the war caused most of the Liberty ships to be removed from service in 1946 and many were subsequently sold to foreign and domestic buyers. Others were retained by the U.S. Maritime Commission for potential reactivation in the event of future military conflicts. &quot;Jeremiah O&#x27;Brien&quot; was mothballed and remained in the National Defense Reserve Fleet in Suisun Bay for 33 years.

===Restoration===
In the 1970s, however, the idea of preserving an unaltered Liberty Ship began to be developed and, under the sponsorship of Rear Admiral Thomas J. Patterson, USMS (then the Western Regional Director of the U.S. Maritime Administration), the ship was put aside for preservation instead of being sold for scrap. In a 1994 interview printed by the Vintage Preservation magazine &quot;Old Glory&quot;, Patterson claimed the ship was steamed to her anchorage in the mothball fleet (unlike the many that were secured as unserviceable and towed into storage), and frequently placed at the back of the list for disposal which undoubtedly contributed to her survival.

An all-volunteer group, the National Liberty Ship Memorial (NLSM), acquired &quot;Jeremiah O&#x27;Brien&quot; in 1979 for restoration. At that time, she was virtually the last Liberty at the anchorage. The volunteers who campaigned to resurrect the mothballed ship (led by Captain Edward MacMichael, NLSM Executive Director, and Master) were able to get the steam plant operating while she remained in Suisun Bay. After more than three decades in mothballs, &quot;Jeremiah O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s&quot; boilers were lit. The ship left the mothball fleet on 6 October 1979 bound for San Francisco Bay, drydocking, and thousands of hours of restoration work. She was the only Liberty Ship to leave the mothball fleet under her own power.

&quot;Jeremiah O&#x27;Brien&quot; then moved to Fort Mason on the San Francisco waterfront just to the west of Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf to become a museum ship dedicated to the men and women who built and sailed with the United States Merchant Marine in World War II. She was named a National Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1984 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1986. Licensed to carry tours around San Francisco Bay, it was suggested that the ship be restored to oceangoing specification. After efforts in securing sponsorship, this was accomplished in time for the 50th &quot;D-Day&quot; Anniversary Celebrations in 1994.

===50th Anniversary of D-Day===
In 1994, &quot;Jeremiah O&#x27;Brien&quot; steamed through the Golden Gate bound for France. She went down the West Coast, through the Panama Canal, and crossed the Atlantic for the first time since World War II. She stopped first in London, England, where she was berthed adjacent to HMS &quot;Belfast&quot;, then went on to Portsmouth for the D-Day +50 celebrations before she continued on to Normandy, where &quot;Jeremiah O&#x27;Brien&quot; and her crew (a volunteer crew of veteran World War II-era sailors and a few cadets from the California Maritime Academy) participated in the 50th Anniversary of Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of Western Europe. She was the only large ship from the original Normandy flotilla to return for the event.

===Today===
Docked at Pier 35, she makes several passenger-carrying daylight cruises each year in the San Francisco Bay, and occasional voyages to more distant ports such as Seattle and San Diego.

Footage of the ship&#x27;s engine was used in the 1997 film &quot;Titanic&quot; to depict the ill-fated ship&#x27;s own triple-expansion engines. The engine is very similar to the engines on board the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;; two of her engines were triple expansion marine steam engines, albeit &quot;Titanic&quot; engines were four cylinders as opposed to three.

The ship is completely restored to its original World War II configuration. Most areas are open to the public, including the engine room, bridge, and cargo holds. Modernization has been kept to a minimum and mostly involves systems related to safety, communications, and navigation.

In 2009, &quot;Jeremiah O&#x27;Brien&quot; was dry docked inside &quot;Eureka&quot; at Pier 70. During that same year, Tim Ferriss hosted a party aboard the ship to celebrate the success of his LitLiberation project.

On 23 May 2020, &quot;Jeremiah O&#x27;Brien&quot; and USS &quot;Pampanito&quot; were threatened by a 4-alarm fire at a warehouse structure next to where &quot;Jeremiah O&#x27;Brien&quot; was berthed at San Francisco&#x27;s Pier 45, but both vessels were undamaged due to the actions of the local firefighters. The fireboat &quot;St. Francis&quot; is credited with saving the ship. Following the fire, the ship was moved on a temporary basis to Pier 35 until repairs to Pier 45 could be made. This relocation was made permanent in 2023 when the nonprofit organization responsible for the ship signed a long-term lease at Pier 35 with the Port of San Francisco.

<doc id="424087" wikidata="Q7396137" url="?curid=424087" title="Sabinas brittle hair syndrome">
<text>Sabinas brittle hair syndrome, also called Sabinas syndrome or brittle hair-mental deficit syndrome, is an autosomal recessive congenital disorder affecting the integumentary system.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms include brittle hair, mild mental retardation and nail dysplasia. The syndrome was first observed in Sabinas, a small community in northern Mexico.

The principal biochemical features of the illness are reduced hair cystine levels, increased copper/zinc ratio, and presence of arginosuccinic acid in the blood and urine.

The key finding is brittle hair with low sulfur content, but alternating dark and light bands under polarizing microscopy, trichoschisis, and absent or defective cuticle are additional important clues for the diagnosis of trichothiodystrophy. Review of literature reveals extensive associated findings in trichothiodystrophy. Amino acid analyses of control hair when compared with those of patients with the Sabinas syndrome showed very striking differences with regard to content of sulphur amino acids. As in previous descriptions of amino acid abnormalities in the trichorrhexis nodosa of arginosuccinicaciduria, there were increases in lysine, aspartic acid, alanine, leucine, isoleucine, and tyrosine.

Trichothiodystrophy represents a central pathologic feature of a specific hair dysplasia associated with several disorders in organs derived from ectoderm and neuroectoderm. Trichothiodystrophy or TTD is a heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive disorders, characterized by abnormally sulfur deficient brittle hair and accompanied by ichthyosis and other manifestations.
Patients with trichothiodystrophy should have a thorough evaluation for other associated manifestations, including investigation of photosensitivity and DNA repair defects. Because the disease appears to be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, detection of low-sulfur brittle hair syndrome is also important for genetic counseling.

==Genetics==
Sabinas brittle hair syndrome is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic trait.

In a study by Howell et al. patients were located and studied by means of complete histories and physical examinations, analyses of serum trace metals, ceruloplasmin concentration, urine and serum amino acids, and routine metabolic urine screens. In addition, serum and urine luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) values were determined, and were interpreted in conjunction with total plasma estrogen, estradiol, and testosterone levels. Close examination demonstrated the scalp hairs were very brittle, coarse, wiry in texture, and broke off quite easily with mechanical trauma such as combing and brushing. Some hairs could be visualized in their follicles, which were broken off at the skin line. Most patients had accompanying hyperkeratosis (thickening of the skin) of moderate degree on exposed surfaces. Maxillary hypoplasia (midfacial retrusion) was significant in many patients. The brittle, short hair, reduced eyelashes, crowded teeth, and dull appearance created a characteristic facial appearance. Post-pubertal patients had development of secondary sexual characteristics consistent with their age, except for sparse pubic escutcheons. All cases studied demonstrated some degree of mental deficiency; I.Q.&#x27;s ranged between 50 and 60. A deficiency in eye–hand coordination was also noted.

==Diagnosis==
The easiest way to test for this condition is through genetic testing. Several methods can be used for genetic testing that can help identity this condition,
* Molecular genetic tests (or gene tests) study single genes or short lengths of DNA to identify mutations and variations that can help lead to a genetic disorder.
* Chromosomal genetic tests help investigate whole chromosomes or long lengths of DNA to see if there are bigger genetic changes, for example, an extra copy of a chromosome that can help cause a genetic condition.
* Biochemical genetic tests study the activity level and amount level of proteins; abnormalities in either can indicate changes to the DNA and result in a genetic disorder.

==Management==
Although there has been no conclusive evidence on medications to manage the disorder, many organizations help with several aspects on living with the chronic condition, not only for the affected but also for the loved ones around them. With services like Global Genes helping contribute to this.

<doc id="424093" wikidata="Q3648979" url="?curid=424093" title="1990s in music">
<text>[[Popular music]] in the 1990s saw the continuation of teen pop and dance-pop trends which had emerged in the 1970s and 1980s. Furthermore, hip hop grew and continued to be highly successful in the decade, with the continuation of the genre&#x27;s golden age. Aside from rap, reggae, contemporary R&amp;B, and urban music in general remained popular throughout the decade; urban music in the late-1980s and 1990s often blended with styles such as soul, funk, and jazz, resulting in fusion genres such as new jack swing, neo-soul, hip hop soul, and g-funk which were popular.

Similarly to the 1980s, rock music was also very popular in the 1990s, yet, unlike the new wave and glam metal-dominated scene of the time, grunge, Britpop, industrial rock, and other alternative rock music emerged and took over as the most popular of the decade, as well as punk rock, ska punk, and nu metal, amongst others, which attained a high level of success at various points throughout the years.

Electronic music, which had risen in popularity in the 1980s, grew highly popular in the 1990s; house and techno from the 1980s rose to international success in this decade, as well as new electronic dance music genres such as rave, happy hardcore, drum and bass, intelligent dance, and trip hop. In Europe, techno, rave, and reggae music were highly successful, while also finding some international success. The decade also featured the rise of contemporary country music as a major genre, which had started in the 1980s.

The 1990s also saw a resurgence of older styles in new contexts, including third wave ska and swing revival, both of which featured a fusion of horn-based music with rock music elements.

==== Alternative rock ====

With the breakthrough of bands such as Nirvana and the popularity of the grunge and Britpop movements in the 1990s, alternative rock entered the musical mainstream and many alternative bands became commercially successful during the 1990s.

By the start of the 1990s, the music industry was enticed by alternative rock&#x27;s commercial possibilities and major labels actively courted bands including Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, Jane&#x27;s Addiction, Dinosaur Jr, and Nirvana. In particular, R.E.M.&#x27;s success had become a blueprint for many alternative bands in the late 1980s and 1990s to follow; the group had outlasted many of its contemporaries and by the 1990s had become one of the most popular bands in the world. Mazzy Star had a top 40 hit with &quot;Fade into You&quot; (1993) and Smash Mouth recorded hits &quot;Walkin&#x27; on the Sun&quot; (1997) and &quot;All Star&quot; (1999).
The Red Hot Chili Peppers became an important band in the rise of alternative rock with their album &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot;. Combining funk rock with more conventional rock music, the Red Hot Chili Peppers were able to achieve mainstream success, culminating with the release of their 1999 album &quot;Californication&quot;.

Some of the top mainstream American alternative rock bands of the 1990s included Hootie and The Blowfish, Collective Soul, Creed, Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Dinosaur Jr, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Green Day, Weezer, Live, 311, The Wallflowers, Toad the Wet Sprocket, R.E.M., The Offspring, Matchbox Twenty, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Soul Asylum, Liz Phair, The Lemonheads, Soundgarden, Counting Crows, Spin Doctors, dc Talk, Goo Goo Dolls, Third Eye Blind, Smash Mouth, The Smashing Pumpkins, 4 Non Blondes, Beck, The Breeders, The Cranberries, Gin Blossoms, Foo Fighters, Sublime, Marcy Playground, No Doubt, Hole, Cake, Blind Melon, Eels, Stone Temple Pilots, Garbage, and Pearl Jam. These bands were variously influenced by ska, punk, pop, metal, and many other musical genres.

===== Alternative metal =====
During the early 1990s a new style of alternative music emerged, which combined elements of alternative rock with heavy metal. This new genre, dubbed &quot;alternative metal&quot;, is considered a precursor to the nu metal movement of the late 1990s. This style was typified by bands such as Tool, Helmet and Jane&#x27;s Addiction. Other bands including Faith No More, Living Colour, Primus, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Rage Against the Machine also blended funk and hip hop elements, creating subgenres of this style such as funk metal and rap metal.

===== Grunge =====
A subgenre of alternative rock, grunge bands were popular during the early 1990s. Grunge music, and its associated subculture, was born out of the Pacific Northwest American states of Washington and Oregon in the 1980s. They delivered a more direct, less polished rock sound. Artists such as Nirvana, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Stone Temple Pilots and Pearl Jam brought alternative rock to popularity in 1991. Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Nevermind&quot; reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; number one, and Pearl Jam&#x27;s &quot;Ten&quot; reached number two a year later.

During the mid-1990s, many grunge bands broke up or became less visible. The death of Kurt Cobain in early 1994, as well as the touring problems for Pearl Jam marked the decline of the genre. By the end of 1996, Soundgarden had broken up and Alice in Chains had played their final live shows with lead singer Layne Staley.

===== Post-grunge =====
At the same time as the original grunge bands went into decline, major record labels began signing and promoting bands that were emulating the genre. The term post-grunge was coined to describe these bands, who emulated the attitudes and music of grunge, particularly thick, distorted guitars, but with a more radio-friendly commercially oriented sound.

In 1995, former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl&#x27;s new band, the Foo Fighters, helped popularize the genre and define its parameters, becoming one of the most commercially successful rock bands in the US, aided by considerable airplay on MTV. Some of the most successful post-grunge acts of the 90s were Candlebox, Bush, Collective Soul, Creed, Matchbox Twenty, Our Lady Peace, Foo Fighters, Everclear, Live and others. The genre would have another wave of successful acts throughout much of the early part of the next decade which includes bands like Nickelback, Lifehouse, 3 Doors Down, and more. Although, some of those bands were formed during the late 1990s, many would not see a commercial breakthrough until the early years of the following decade.

===== Indie rock =====

Following the immense success of alternative rock in the 1990s, the term &quot;indie rock&quot; became associated with the bands and genres that remained underground. Bands like Sonic Youth and Pixies set the stage for the rise of indie rock in the underground scene, with bands such as Pavement, Archers of Loaf, Sleater-Kinney, Built to Spill, Modest Mouse, Yo La Tengo, The Breeders, Superchunk, Dinosaur Jr., Cat Power, Guided by Voices, Sebadoh, The Jesus Lizard, Liz Phair, and The Flaming Lips gaining popularity throughout the decade. The B-52&#x27;s made a comeback with their 1994 cover of Meet the Flintstones.

===== Ska punk =====
By the late 1990s, mainstream interest in third wave ska bands such as Reel Big Fish, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Sublime, and No Doubt waned as other music genres gained momentum.

==== Skate punk and pop punk ====

Punk rock in the United States underwent a resurgence in the early to mid-1990s. Punk rock at that time was not commercially viable, and no major record label signed a punk rock band until Green Day&#x27;s breakthrough in 1994. Both these factors contributed to the emergence of a number of independent record labels, often run by people in bands in order to release their own music and that of their friends. The independent labels Lookout! Records, Fat Wreck Chords and Epitaph Records achieved commercial success.

Skate punk broke into the mainstream in the mid-1990s, initially with the Northern California-based skate punk band Green Day and in the late 1990s with the Southern California-based pop punk band Blink-182 as well who all achieved massive worldwide commercial success. Green Day&#x27;s album &quot;Dookie&quot; (1994) sold 10 million copies in the United States and another 10 million copies worldwide. Soon after the release of &quot;Dookie&quot;, The Offspring released the album &quot;Smash&quot;. The album sold over 14 million copies worldwide, setting a record for most albums sold on an independent label. In 1996, Weezer released its sophomore album &quot;Pinkerton&quot;, which became a major influence for many 2000s emo bands, although failing to reach the commercial success of the band&#x27;s debut &quot;Weezer (Blue Album)&quot;. Rancid&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot; and NOFX&#x27;s &quot;Punk in Drublic&quot; were also released during this period and both of them went gold as well. By the end of the year, &quot;Dookie&quot; and &quot;Smash&quot; had sold millions of copies. The commercial success of these two albums attracted major label interest in skate/pop punk, with bands such as Bad Religion being offered lucrative contracts to leave their independent record labels. In 1999, Blink-182 made a breakthrough with the release of &quot;Enema of the State&quot;, which sold over 15 million copies worldwide receiving multi-platinum status in the United States, Canada, Australia, Italy, New Zealand and platinum status in Europe and the United Kingdom. Green Day are seen as the biggest act in punk rock whilst Weezer and Blink-182 are seen to have the most influence on later bands like Fall Out Boy and All Time Low.

==== Heavy metal ====
Many subgenres of metal developed outside of the commercial mainstream during the 1980s. In the early 1990s the thrash metal genre achieved break-out success, mainly due to the massive success of Metallica&#x27;s eponymous 5th album which was released in 1991 and brought thrash metal to the mainstream for the first time. Metallica&#x27;s success was followed by Megadeth&#x27;s &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot; (1992) which hit number 2, Anthrax, Pantera, and Slayer cracked the top 10, and albums by regional bands such as Testament and Sepultura entered the top 100.

In the later half of the decade industrial metal became popular. The top mainstream American industrial metal bands of the 1990s included Nine Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson, White Zombie, KMFDM, Ministry, and Fear Factory.

Death Metal gained momentum in the early 1990s as well, with acts such as Death, Deicide, Morbid Angel, Cannibal Corpse and Obituary among others.

The Second wave of Black Metal gained popularity with leading force in Norway in Mayhem, Burzum and Darkthrone.

==== Pop rock ====
In the 1990s, there was a revival of the singer-songwriter movement of the 1970s. This movement lasted up to about 2004 with artists like Norah Jones, Dido and Sarah McLachlan. Important artists of this movement include Mariah Carey, Alanis Morissette, Tori Amos, Fiona Apple, Liz Phair, Amy Grant, Meredith Brooks, Juliana Hatfield, Edwin McCain, Duncan Sheik, Jewel, Natalie Merchant, Tracy Chapman, k.d. lang, Tal Bachman, Shawn Mullins, Sheryl Crow and Lisa Loeb. A famous album of the movement was the multi-platinum 1995 album &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; by Alanis Morissette as well as Sheryl Crow&#x27;s 1993 album &quot;Tuesday Night Music Club&quot; and her 1996 eponymous album. Canadian artist Tom Cochrane got hit &quot;Life is a Highway&quot;, Marc Cohn had &quot;Walking in Memphis&quot;, and 4 Non Blondes released hit &quot;What&#x27;s Up&quot;.

The trend ended in the late 1990s with Lynda Thomas, who became the first idol of the &quot;teen pop-rock&quot; movement, which later in the 2000s reached its highest level of popularity with later singers such as Avril Lavigne, Kelly Clarkson, P!nk, Hilary Duff, Miley Cyrus, Aly &amp; AJ, and Ashlee Simpson.

Also in the 1990s, artists such as Jeff Buckley, Dave Matthews, Shania Twain, Bryan Adams, Elliott Smith, Melissa Etheridge, as well as Sheryl Crow borrowed from the singer-songwriter tradition to create new acoustic-based rock styles.

==== Hard rock ====
Third wave glam metal artists such as Firehouse, Warrant, Extreme, Slaughter, and Skid Row experienced their greatest success at the start of the decade, but these bands&#x27; popularity waned after 1992 or so. Mötley Crüe and Poison, who were hugely popular in the 1980s, released successful albums in 1989 and 1990, respectively, and continued to benefit from that success in the early part of the decade. The Black Crowes ushered in a more classic rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll sound with their successful debut in 1990. More well-established hard rock artists such as Guns N&#x27; Roses, Van Halen, Def Leppard, Ozzy Osbourne, and Tom Petty released successful albums and remained very popular in the first half of the decade, while Aerosmith, Bon Jovi, and Metallica maintained their popularity throughout the entire decade, largely by re-inventing themselves with each new album and exploring different sounds. Kiss released what was claimed to be a reunion album with the original four members in the late 1990s, but it was later revealed Ace Frehley and Peter Criss had very limited performances on the album.

=== Pop ===
British girl group Spice Girls managed to break the US market, becoming the most commercially successful British group in North America since The Beatles. Their impact brings about a widespread invasion of teen pop acts to the US charts which had been predominantly dominated by grunge and hip hop prior to the success of the group. Between 1997 and 2000, American teen pop singers and groups including Backstreet Boys, *NSYNC, 98 Degrees, Hanson, Christina Aguilera, Britney Spears, Jessica Simpson, Mandy Moore, Jennifer Lopez and Destiny&#x27;s Child became popular, following the lead of the Spice Girls by targeting early members of Generation Y. At the end of the decade, Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera had huge successes with their hit singles, &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot; and &quot;Genie in a Bottle&quot; and respective debut albums which remain among the best selling of all time. Britney Spears&#x27;s single/ album went onto the top of the US charts in early 1999. &quot;Womanizer&quot; (Jive) was the second No. 1 hit for Spears after her debut single, &quot; ... Baby One More Time.&quot; Spears has the longest gap between No. 1 hits since Cher&#x27;s &quot;Believe&quot; claimed pole position in March 1999, just 10 days shy of 25 years after &quot;Dark Lady&quot; landed in first place.

Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Erotica&quot;, was released in 1992 and became one of her most controversial releases. In February 1998, Madonna released the critically acclaimed &quot;Ray of Light&quot;. Cyndi Lauper released her first mature album &quot;Hat Full of Stars&quot; (1993), which leaves complete the image of her first two albums, but was highly praised by critics even though it did not achieve commercial success. Larry Flick of &quot;Billboard&quot; called Janet Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Velvet Rope&quot; &quot;[t]he best American album of the year and the most empowering of her last five.&quot; Released in October 1997, &quot;The Velvet Rope&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. In August 1997, the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Got &#x27;til It&#x27;s Gone&quot;, was released to radio, peaking at number 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Rhythmic Airplay Chart. The single sampled the Joni Mitchell song &quot;Big Yellow Taxi&quot;, and featured a cameo appearance by rapper Q-Tip. &quot;Got &#x27;til It&#x27;s Gone&quot; won the 1997 Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video. The album&#x27;s second single &quot;Together Again&quot;, became her eighth number one hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart, and placing her on par with Elton John, and The Rolling Stones. The single spent a record 46 weeks on the Hot 100, as well as spending 19 weeks on the UK singles chart. &quot;I Get Lonely&quot; peaked at number three on the Hot 100. &quot;The Velvet Rope&quot; sold over ten million albums worldwide and was certified three times platinum by the RIAA. Celine Dion achieved worldwide success during the decade after releasing English-language albums, such as &quot;Falling into You&quot; (1996) and &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Love&quot; (1997), which were both certified diamond by the RIAA. In December 1997, Dion released the single &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; from the &quot;Titanic&quot; which became the second-best-selling single by a female artist in history.

==== Adult contemporary ====
In the early 1990s, Mariah Carey&#x27;s hit singles such as &quot;Vision of Love&quot; (1990) and &quot;Love Takes Time&quot; (1990), and Whitney Houston&#x27;s &quot;All the Man That I Need&quot; (1990) and &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; (1992) topped the radio charts for the adult contemporary format.

=== Contemporary R&amp;B ===
Whitney Houston&#x27;s quiet storm hits included &quot;All the Man That I Need&quot; (1990) and &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; (1992), later became the best-selling physical single by a female act of all time, with sales of over 20 million copies worldwide. Her 1992 hit soundtrack &quot;The Bodyguard&quot;, spent 20 weeks on top of the Billboard 200, sold over 45 million copies worldwide and remains the best-selling soundtrack album of all time. According to the RIAA, Houston is the best-selling female R&amp;B artist of the 20th century. In the 1990s, Mariah Carey&#x27;s career originated in quiet storm, with hit singles such as &quot;Vision of Love&quot; (1990) and &quot;Love Takes Time&quot; (1990). Her albums &quot;Music Box&quot; (1993) and &quot;Daydream&quot; (1995) are some of the best-selling albums of all time, and had R&amp;B/HipHop influences. Richard J. Ripani wrote that Carey and Houston, &quot;both of whom rely heavily on the gospel music vocal tradition, display an emphasis on melisma that increased in R&amp;B generally over the 1980s and 1990s.&quot; Beyoncé quoted Carey&#x27;s &quot;Vision of Love&quot; to make her want to sing, as did many other popular artist. Also during the early 1990s, Boyz II Men re-popularized classic soul-inspired vocal harmonies. Michael Jackson incorporated new jack swing into his 1991 album &quot;Dangerous&quot;, with sales over 35 million, and was one of the best selling albums of the decade.
The popularity of ballads and R&amp;B led to the development of a radio format called Urban adult contemporary. Popular African-American contemporary R&amp;B artists included Mariah Carey, Mark Morrison, Faith Evans, 112, D&#x27;Angelo, Lauryn Hill, Whitney Houston, En Vogue, Toni Braxton, Boyz II Men, Macy Gray, Mary J. Blige, Dru Hill, Vanessa Williams, Groove Theory, Bell Biv Devoe, Jodeci, Janet Jackson, Diana King, Tony! Toni! Tone!, Brownstone, Shanice, Usher, SWV, Silk, 702, Aaliyah, Keith Sweat, TLC, Xscape, Brandy, Monica, Mýa, Total, Tevin Campbell and R.Kelly. In contrast to the works of Boyz II Men, Babyface and similar artists, other R&amp;B artists from this same period began adding even more of a hip hop sound to their work. The synthesizer-heavy rhythm tracks of new jack swing was replaced by grittier East Coast hip hop-inspired backing tracks, resulting in a genre labelled &quot;hip hop soul&quot; by producer Sean Combs. The style became less popular by the end of the 1990s, but later experienced a resurgence.

During the mid-1990s, Mary J. Blige, Mariah Carey, Faith Evans, TLC, Xscape, Whitney Houston and Boyz II Men brought contemporary R&amp;B to the masses.

Jackson&#x27;s self-titled fifth studio album &quot;janet.&quot; (1993), which came after her historic multimillion-dollar contract with Virgin Records, sold over 20 million copies worldwide. Houston, Boyz II Men and Carey recorded several &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 No. 1 hits, including &quot;Exhale (Shoop Shoop)&quot;, &quot;One Sweet Day&quot;, a collaboration between Boyz II Men and Carey, which became the longest-running No. 1 hit in Hot 100 history. Carey, Boyz II Men and TLC released albums in 1994 and 1995—&quot;Daydream&quot;, &quot;II&quot;, and &quot;CrazySexyCool&quot; respectively – that sold over ten million copies, earning them diamond status in the U.S. Beginning in 1995, the Grammy Awards enacted the Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Album with &quot;II&quot;, and Boyz II Men became the first recipient. The award was later received by TLC for &quot;CrazySexyCool&quot; in 1996.

Mariah Carey&#x27;s duet with Boyz II Men &quot;One Sweet Day&quot; was pronounced song of the decade, charting at number one on the decade-end chart. Carey became Billboard&#x27;s most successful female artist of the decade, and one of the most successful R&amp;B acts of the 1990s.

R&amp;B artists such as Janet Jackson, Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston, R.Kelly and Mariah Carey are some of the best selling music artists of all time, and especially in the 1990s brought Contemporary R&amp;B to a worldwide platform.

=== Neo-soul ===
 In the mid-1990s, neo soul, which added 1970s soul influences to the hip hop soul blend, arose, led by artists such as D&#x27;Angelo, Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill, and Maxwell. Lauryn Hill and Missy Elliott further blurred the line between R&amp;B and hip hop by recording both styles. D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; was released in June 1995. Although sales were sluggish at first, the album was eventually a hit, due in large part to &quot;Lady,&quot; a top-ten hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 charts, peaking at No. 10. The album earned platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America, for shipments of one million copies in the U.S., while its total sales have been estimated within the range of 1.5 million to over two million copies. While the album was certified platinum in the United States, indicating shipments of one million units, its total sales were adversely reported by several publications with estimations ranging from 1.5 to 2 million units. The album helped give commercial visibility to the burgeoning Neo soul movement of the 1990s, along with debut albums by Maxwell, Erykah Badu, and Lauryn Hill. The album was a critical success as well and appeared on many critics&#x27; best-of lists that year.

Hill&#x27;s &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; (1998) remains her only studio album; it received critical acclaim, some suggesting it was the greatest neo-soul album of all time. It debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and sold 19 million copies worldwide, spawning the singles &quot;Doo Wop (That Thing)&quot;, &quot;Ex-Factor&quot;, and &quot;Everything Is Everything&quot;. At the 41st Grammy Awards, the album earned her five Grammy Awards, including the Album of the Year. Soon after, Hill dropped out of the public-eye, mainly because of her dissatisfaction with the music industry.

=== Hip hop ===
The decade is notable for the extension of the rap music scene from New York City, the center of hip hop culture throughout the 1980s, to other cities like Los Angeles, Atlanta, Houston, the Bay Area, Miami, Chicago, and Memphis.

Dr. Dre&#x27;s 1992 album &quot;The Chronic&quot; provided a template for modern gangsta rap. In addition to &quot;The Chronic&quot;, Dre introduced a new artist known as Snoop Dogg which allowed for the success of Snoop&#x27;s album, &quot;Doggystyle&quot;, in 1993. Due to the success of Death Row Records, West Coast hip hop dominated hip hop during the early 1990s, alongside The Notorious B.I.G. on the East Coast. Hip hop became the best selling music genre by the mid-1990s.

High-selling rap albums released in the 1990s include &quot;The Chronic&quot; by Dr. Dre, &quot;Illmatic&quot; by Nas, &quot;To The Extreme&quot; by Vanilla Ice, &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot; by Tupac, &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)&quot; by Wu-Tang Clan, &quot;Ready To Die&quot; by Notorious B.I.G., &quot;Ridin&#x27; Dirty&quot; by UGK, &quot;19 Naughty III&quot; by Naughty by Nature, and &quot;Doggystyle&quot; by Snoop Dogg.

In 1998, Lauryn Hill released her debut album &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot;, which debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. In 1999, &quot;The Miseducation&quot; was nominated for 10 Grammys, winning five (which at the time was unheard of for a hip-hop artist) and eventually went on to sell over 19 million copies worldwide.

The early 1990s was dominated by female rappers, such as Queen Latifah and hip hop trio Salt-N-Pepa. The late 1990s saw the rise of successful female rappers and a turn in East Coast hip hop, with the debuts of Lil&#x27; Kim (with &quot;Hard Core&quot;) and Foxy Brown (with &quot;Ill Na Na&quot;), due to their use of excessive raunchy and provocative lyrics.

In the early 1990s, the hip-hop/dance group C+C Music Factory also saw huge success, especially with the song &quot;Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)&quot;. 

By the end of the 1990s, attention turned towards dirty south and crunk, with artists such as Outkast, Trick Daddy, Trina, Three 6 Mafia, Master P, Juvenile, Missy Elliott and Lil Wayne.

The mid-1990s were marked by the deaths of the West Coast-based rapper Tupac and the East Coast-based rapper The Notorious B.I.G., which conspiracy theorists claim were killed as a result of the East Coast–West Coast hip hop rivalry.

Samples and interpolations of old songs in hip hop songs were common in the 1990s as a way to celebrate the end of the 2nd millennium and the 20th century by going retro. Many of the following songs include samples from older songs: &quot;U Can&#x27;t Touch This&quot; by MC Hammer; &quot;Jump Around&quot; by House of Pain; &quot;Mo Money Mo Problems&quot; and &quot;Big Poppa&quot; by Notorious B.I.G.; &quot;It Was a Good Day&quot; by Ice Cube; &quot;Regulate&quot; by Warren G and Nate Dogg; &quot;Ice Ice Baby&quot; by Vanilla Ice; &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Missing You&quot; by Puff Daddy featuring Faith Evans and 112; &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Nigga&quot; by Jay-Z featuring Foxy Brown; &quot;Killing Me Softly&quot; by The Fugees; &quot;Feel So Good&quot; by Mase; &quot;Hey Lover&quot; by Boyz II Men featuring LL Cool J; &quot;C.R.E.A.M.&quot; by Wu-Tang Clan; &quot;Nuthin&#x27; but a &#x27;G&#x27; Thang&quot; by Dr. Dre featuring Snoop Dogg; &quot;No Diggity&quot; by BLACKstreet; &quot;Gangsta&#x27;s Paradise&quot; by Coolio featuring L.V.; &quot;The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)&quot; by Missy Elliott; &quot;I Wish&quot; by Skee-Lo; &quot;People Everyday&quot; and &quot;Tennessee&quot; by Arrested Development; &quot;The Humpty Dance&quot; by Digital Underground; Tupac&#x27;s &quot;Do for Love&quot;, &quot;I Get Around&quot;, and &quot;California Love&quot;; and Will Smith&#x27;s &quot;Men in Black&quot;, and &quot;Wild Wild West&quot;.

Some of the most prominent rap artists of the 1990s include Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, Tupac, Notorious B.I.G., Nas, Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, LL Cool J, Eazy-E, Wu-Tang Clan, Vanilla Ice, Snoop Dogg, Busta Rhymes, Cypress Hill, Warren G, Coolio, Big Pun, OutKast, MC Hammer, The Fugees, Naughty by Nature , Mobb Deep, A Tribe Called Quest, Puff Daddy, Will Smith, DMX, Master P, Jay-Z and Eminem.

=== Electronic music ===

With the explosive growth of computers, music technology and consequent reduction in the cost of equipment in the early 1990s, it became possible for a wider number of musicians to produce electronic music. Even though initially most of the electronic music was dance music, the genre developed in the 1990s as musicians started producing music which was not necessarily designed for the dance-floor but rather for home listening (later on referred to as &quot;Electronica&quot;) and slower-paced music which was played throughout chillout rooms—the relaxation sections of the clubs (later on referred to as &quot;downtempo&quot;, &quot;chill-out music&quot; and &quot;ambient music&quot;).

Since we don&#x27;t really know what was the first electronic music computer generated track ever made, in the USA we can find in the intro of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; released in 1973, a fully completed music track using only computers and machines. At the same time, in Germany, Kraftwerk is recognized as the very first band creating music only with machines and computers. Kraftwerk were the pioneers of what is electronic music nowadays.

Then, the electronic music scene exploded in the world, with at the front line, Chicago for House Music, and Detroit the Techno.

In the late 1990s, Madonna had success with her album &quot;Ray of Light&quot; which experimented with electronica sounds. Moby achieved international success in the ambient electronica scene after releasing his critically acclaimed album &quot;Play&quot; in 1999 which produced an impressive eight hit singles (including his most popular songs &quot;Porcelain&quot;, &quot;Natural Blues&quot; and &quot;Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad?&quot;).
Electronic dance music was highly successful throughout the decade in Europe, particularly in Britain, Germany and Italy. Outdoor raves were popular at the start of the decade in the UK, before the government introduced its Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, leading to a higher number of superclubs opening. Among the most successful were Ministry of Sound and Cream. Before the ban, popular genres at these raves included breakbeat hardcore and techno, though in the mid-1990s these genres splintered into separate scenes, such as happy hardcore, jungle and drum and bass, the latter of which received mainstream recognition through artists such as Goldie and Roni Size.

Other notable British genres that emerged during the decade include progressive house, big beat, vocal house, trip hop and UK garage (or speed garage). The latter genre developed in London in the late 1990s and continued to be successful through to the early 2000s. DJ Culture also gained momentum during the 1990s. DJs such as Sasha, John Digweed, Paul Oakenfold, Ferry Corsten and Pete Tong became big names in the business, which was made desirable by magazines such as &quot;Mixmag&quot; and &quot;Muzik&quot;.

Italy ended the 1980s with Italo house, before becoming one of many countries to release Eurodance and Hi-NRG. Both genres were commercially successful across the world, with artists such as 2 Unlimited, La Bouche and Captain Hollywood promoting the genre. Countries such as Germany and Belgium, however, developed harder, darker styles of music, namely gabber, hard trance and techno. Trance emerged in the early 1990s and by the end of the decade had penetrated most of Europe, with artists such as ATB, Ferry Corsten, WestBam and Paul Van Dyk gaining huge commercial and underground success. European trance remained popular until the early 2000s. Goa became famed for its goa trance parties and Ibiza became the Number 1 clubbers&#x27; holiday destination.

=== Country music ===

The popularity of country music exploded in the early 1990s. The stage had been set in 1989 with the debuts of several performers who proved to be profoundly influential on the genre during the 1990s and beyond. Most notable of that group was Garth Brooks, who shattered records for album sales and concert attendance throughout the decade. The RIAA has certified his recordings at a combined (128× platinum), denoting roughly 113 million U.S. shipments. Brooks recorded primarily in a honky-tonk style, although he frequently combined elements of soft rock and arena rock in his songs. His songs sometimes explored social themes, such as domestic violence (in &quot;The Thunder Rolls&quot;) and racial harmony (&quot;We Shall Be Free)&quot;, while others – such as &quot;Friends in Low Places&quot; — were just good-time songs with traditional country themes of heartbreak, loneliness and dealing with those emotions.

Other performers who rose in popularity during the early 1990s were neo-traditionalists Clint Black and Alan Jackson and southern rock influenced Travis Tritt. Mary Chapin Carpenter had a folk-style about her, while Lorrie Morgan (daughter of the late George Morgan, himself a country legend) blended elements of country and pop, and occasionally operatic sounds in songs such as &quot;Something in Red.&quot; Trisha Yearwood was one of the top new singers of 1991, while Diamond Rio blended traditional and bluegrass styles and Brooks &amp; Dunn provided a driving honky-tonk sound. Tom Cochrane also saw huge success with his signature song &quot;Life Is a Highway&quot;.

During the early-to-middle part of the decade, several recordings were influenced by the popularity of line dancing, including &quot;Boot-Scootin&#x27; Boogie&quot; by Brooks &amp; Dunn and &quot;Achy Breaky Heart&quot; by Billy Ray Cyrus. This influence was so great that Chet Atkins was quoted as saying &quot;The music has gotten pretty bad, I think. It&#x27;s all that damn line dancing.&quot;

A steady stream of new artists began their careers during the mid- and late-1990s. Many of these careers were short-lived, but several went on to long-lived, profitable careers. The most successful of the new artists were Yearwood, Shania Twain, LeAnn Rimes, Lee Ann Womack, Martina McBride, Kenny Chesney, Collin Raye, Faith Hill, and Tim McGraw, while Lonestar and Dixie Chicks were the most successful new groups. Twain&#x27;s &quot;Come on Over&quot; album became the best-selling album released by a female of any genre. Yearwood became the first woman in more than 25 years to have her debut single top the Billboard Country Singles chart in 1991 with her single &quot;She&#x27;s in Love with the Boy&quot;. Yearwood&#x27;s debut album also became the first by a female country act to sell over 1 million copies, eventually going double platinum.
Among artists whose success continued from the 1980s, Reba McEntire was the most successful of the female artists, selling more than 30 million albums during the decade, gaining eight number-one hit singles on the U.S. Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks chart and six number one albums internationally, including her best-selling album, &quot;Greatest Hits Vol. 2&quot;, which was released in September 1993 and has sold over an international amount of 10 million copies to date. George Strait, a neo-traditionalist whose national success began in the early 1980s, enjoyed success as both a radio artist (17 No. 1 songs) and as a movie star (1992&#x27;s &quot;Pure Country&quot;). Alabama, the most successful country band of the 1980s, continued their run of popularity with sell-out concerts and best-selling albums, while topping the country chart five times. Among older artists having big hits, Conway Twitty was one of the most successful, scoring two Top 3 hits with &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; and &quot;I Couldn&#x27;t See You Leaving&quot;, while Eddie Rabbitt had a No. 1 hit with &quot;On Second Thought.&quot; Dolly Parton had a No. 1 hit (with relative newcomer Ricky Van Shelton) on &quot;Rockin&#x27; Years&quot; in 1991 and had several top 15 hits. Although his 1990s singles never reached the top 20 (excepting for a duet single with Randy Travis), George Jones (who had been around since the 1950s) regularly recorded and released critically acclaimed material, including the semi-autobiographical &quot;Choices.&quot; The Oak Ridge Boys continued their run of success with a No. 1 hit (&quot;No Matter How High&quot;) and several other top 40 hits; in 1995, upon the departure of William Lee Golden&#x27;s replacement Steve Sanders, Golden reunited with longtime band members Duane Allen, Joe Bonsall and Richard Sterban, and the group has remained intact since then. While the Oak Ridge Boys&#x27; contemporaries The Statler Brothers were no longer reaching the top 40, the veteran group remained highly popular with fans and their new albums continued to sell well. Other artists reaching the top 10 of the Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks chart were Waylon Jennings, Anne Murray, and Kenny Rogers.
Pop-influenced country music began growing in popularity, particularly after Twain and Hill rose in popularity in the latter half of the 1990s. In 1998, Hill&#x27;s &quot;This Kiss&quot; and Twain&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;re Still the One&quot; both reached the top 10 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, in addition to peaking at No. 1 on the Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks chart. Rimes had a multi-million selling hit with &quot;How Do I Live&quot; (a song successfully covered by Yearwood), while Lonestar also had a huge crossover hit with &quot;Amazed.&quot; Although the occurrence of country crossing over to the pop charts goes back as far as the start of the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts in 1940, some critics began to be troubled by a trend toward what they perceived as pop music marketed as country; they contended that radio was concentrating more on newer music while ignoring the more traditional styles of older artists such as Merle Haggard, George Jones, and others who continued to record and release new material. Johnny Cash and producer Rick Rubin once purchased a full-page advertisement in &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine – after Cash&#x27;s album &quot;Unchained&quot; won a Grammy for Best Country Album, despite a lack of support from radio – showing a young Cash displaying his middle finger and sarcastically &quot;thanking&quot; radio for supporting the album. The criticism of pop-influenced and non-traditional styles in country music, however, dated back to the 1970s although it had quieted down comparably during the 1980s.

In the 1990s, alternative country came to refer to a diverse group of musicians and singers operating outside the traditions and industry of mainstream country music. In general, they eschewed the high production values and pop outlook of the Nashville-dominated industry, to produce music with a lo-fi sound, frequently infused with a strong punk and rock &amp; roll aesthetic, bending the traditional rules of country music. Lyrics were often bleak, gothic or socially aware. Other initiators include Old 97&#x27;s, Steve Earle, Uncle Tupelo, Son Volt, Ryan Adams, My Morning Jacket, Blitzen Trapper, and Drive-By Truckers.

A number of notable artists in country music died during the decade, including Twitty, Webb Pierce, Dottie West, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Roger Miller, Roy Acuff, Charlie Rich, Minnie Pearl, Faron Young, John Denver, Carl Perkins, Grandpa Jones, Tammy Wynette, Eddie Rabbitt, Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, Rex Allen and Hank Snow.

=== Jazz ===

==== Swing revival ====
During the 1990s, concurrent with third wave ska, swing music made a resurgence in the form of swing revival, which brought the jazz form into the pop charts. Reaching its commercial zenith around the time of the movie &quot;Swingers&quot;, whose soundtrack featured numerous 1990s swing bands, the movement was exemplified by bands such as Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, Cherry Poppin&#x27; Daddies, Squirrel Nut Zippers, and the Brian Setzer Orchestra. The highest-charting song of the genre would have been &quot;Jump, Jive an&#x27; Wail&quot; by the Brian Setzer Orchestra, which peaked at No. 23 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S. in 1998, and won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals in 1999.

== Europe ==
=== Rock ===

==== Madchester ====
In the late 1980s/early 1990s, a counter-culture movement rose from the Manchester club scene that came to be known as Madchester. Happy Mondays, Inspiral Carpets and the Stone Roses were the pre-eminent bands.

==== Britpop ====

In the early 1990s, a counter-culture movement rose in Britain, called Britpop by the music press, rejecting the themes of disenfranchised youth coming out of America in favor of songs written specifically about the experiences of the British youth. Although the movement was heavily influenced by 1960s, 1970s and 1980s British rock, there was very little that musically defined the Britpop bands beyond the intensely British lyrical themes. Britpop bands such as Blur, Suede, Kula Shaker, Pulp, Ash, Ocean Colour Scene, Elastica, Supergrass, the Verve and Oasis regularly topped the singles and album charts throughout the decade.

Oasis were the biggest band of the Britpop era at the forefront of alternative rock, as their second album &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot; became the second highest selling studio album of all time in the UK. &quot;Wonderwall&quot; peaked at number 2 on the UK Singles Chart, and number 8 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Their era-defining concerts at Knebworth Park, playing to 250,000 people over two nights, broke records for attendance and ticket applications. In addition to this, they made a significant impact on the US market, achieving three top 5 albums in that country. The Britpop phenomena ran out of steam by the end of the 1990s with most of its most successful bands splitting up or fading away, although bands that rose from the rubble of predecessors Oasis were Travis, Coldplay and Keane.

==== Post-Britpop ====
From about 1997, Britpop as a movement began to dissolve, and emerging bands began to avoid the Britpop label while still producing music derived from it. Many of these bands tended to mix elements of British traditional rock (or British trad rock), particularly the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and Small Faces with American influences, including post-grunge. Post-Britpop bands like Coldplay, Travis, Keane, Stereophonics, Snow Patrol and Feeder achieved much wider international success than most of the Britpop groups that had preceded them, and were some of the most commercially successful acts of the late 1990s.

==== Shoegaze ====
Shoegaze is an indie and alternative rock subgenre distinguished by an ethereal blend of obscured vocals, guitar distortion and effects, feedback, and overwhelming volume. The album &quot;Loveless&quot; (1991) by My Bloody Valentine is widely regarded as the genre&#x27;s defining release; other notable shoegaze bands include Slowdive, Ride, Lush, Pale Saints, and Chapterhouse. &quot;The Scene That Celebrates Itself&quot; was a loose label given to shoegaze bands and other affiliated bands in London in the early 1990s. Most shoegaze artists followed in the footsteps of My Bloody Valentine and bands like Dinosaur Jr., the Jesus and Mary Chain, and Cocteau Twins on their late 1980s recordings.

==== Other trends ====

The Irish Celtic folk rock band the Corrs achieved international success during the late 1990s with a series of hit recordings which established them as international stars and helped prolong a successful career that continued into the 2000s. The Scottish rock duo The Proclaimers achieved success with &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Be (500 Miles)&quot;.

=== Pop ===
Pop music and dance music became popular throughout the 1990s. Popular European pop artists of the 1990s included Seal, M People, 2 Unlimited, and Ace of Base.

During the 1990s, some European managers created their own boy band acts, beginning with Nigel Martin-Smith&#x27;s Take That and East 17, which competed with Louis Walsh&#x27;s Irish bands Westlife and Boyzone. In 1996, the male saturated market was turned on its head by one of the most successful and influential pop acts of the decade, the Spice Girls. The group achieve nine number one singles in the UK and US, including &quot;Wannabe&quot;, &quot;2 Become 1&quot; and &quot;Spice Up Your Life&quot;. The group, unlike their British boy band predecessors, manage to break America and achieve the best-selling album of 1997 in the US. More girl groups began to emerge such as All Saints, who had five number one hits in the UK and two multi-platinum albums. By the end of the century, the grip of boy bands on the charts was faltering, but proved the basis for solo careers like that of Robbie Williams, formerly of Take That, who achieved six number one singles in the UK between 1998 and 2004. Additional popular European teen pop acts of the 1990s included Ace of Base, Aqua and A*Teens. The German singer Lou Bega also achieved success with his cover of &quot;Mambo No. 5&quot; 

Ballad songs were popular during this decade, and popular European artists included George Michael, Robert Palmer, Sade, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, the Cranberries, Lisa Stansfield and Roxette. Danish pop/soft rock band Michael Learns to Rock, fronted by singer/songwriter/keyboardist Jascha Richter, were well known for their ballads, particularly in Asia with songs such as &quot;The Actor&quot;, &quot;Sleeping Child&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s Why (You Go Away)&quot;, and &quot;Paint My Love&quot;.

In summer 1996, the Spanish music duo Los del Río popularized the dance craze &quot;Macarena&quot; with their summer hit &quot;Macarena&quot;. The song was featured prominently in many other countries during the mid-1990s.

In October 1998, the American artist Cher released her Euro disco album Believe, which was popular and sold more than 10 million copies worldwide.

=== Electronic music ===
With the explosive growth of computers music technology and consequent reduction in the cost of equipment in the early 1990s, it became possible for a wider number of musicians to produce electronic music.

The popularity of house, techno and rave in the early part of the decade lead to the boom of the more commercial Eurodance genre. Popular European Eurodance acts of the decade included Toy-Box, Daze, Jonny Jakobsen, Alexia, Alice Deejay, Rednex, Haddaway, Captain Jack, Captain Hollywood Project, Basic Element, Solid Base, Daze, Gigi D&#x27;Agostino, Vengaboys, 2 Unlimited, Cappella, Eiffel 65, Corona, Culture Beat, DJ Bobo, Dr. Alban, T.H. Express, Ice MC, La Bouche, 2 Brothers on the 4th Floor, Twenty 4 Seven, Leila K, Fun Factory, Masterboy, Mr. President, Pandora, Magic Affair, Maxx, Loft, Sash!, BKS, Snap!, Playahitty, Love Inc., Real McCoy, Urban Cookie Collective, Scatman John, Paradisio and Whigfield. Eventually the popularity of the Eurodance genre lead to the huge popularity of the trance genre in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

The 1990s also saw the development and refinement of IDM (intelligent dance music), which borrowed from forms such as techno, drum and bass and acid house music and introduced more abstract elements, including heavy use of digital signal processing.

====United Kingdom====
In the United Kingdom, popular electronic genres of the 1990s included breakbeat hardcore, drum and bass/jungle, big beat and UK garage. Among the most commercially successful electronic acts in the 1990s of these scenes were artists such as the Prodigy, the Chemical Brothers, Fatboy Slim, Aphex Twin, Autechre, Boards of Canada, Squarepusher, Leftfield, LFO, Massive Attack, Portishead, Underworld and Faithless. Notable 1990s UK garage acts included the Dreem Teem, Tuff Jam, Grant Nelson, 187 Lockdown, R.I.P. Productions/Double 99, Dem 2, Artful Dodger and Sunship.

Acid jazz saw a rise in popularity in the early part of the decade, with acts such as Jamiroquai, Incognito, the Brand New Heavies, Us3, the James Taylor Quartet, Stereo MCs, Ronny Jordan, Galliano, and Corduroy, as well as some American acts such as Digable Planets and Buckshot LeFonque.

The arrival of Massive Attack in the early 1990s lead to a new style of slow electronic music dubbed trip hop and influenced groups such as Portishead, Björk, Tricky, Morcheeba and Thievery Corporation.

== Latin America ==
=== Pop ===

Puerto Rico became a merengue stronghold in the early 1990s, with acts such as Elvis Crespo, Olga Tañón and Grupo Manía topping the charts throughout Latin America.

Latin boys band and vocal pop groups were storming up the charts in Mexico and Central America. Mexican boy band Magneto spawned hits in the early 1990s but split in 1996. In 1995, their successors, Mercurio continued making top hits like &quot;Bye Bye Baby&quot; and &quot;Explota Corazón&quot;. MDO, a Puerto Rican boy band also hoarded the charts with songs like &quot;No Puedo Olvidarme de Ti&quot;. Mexican pop groups Onda Vaselina and Kabah spanned several hits in the Latin American charts and made history in the Mexican charts. Jeans, Mexican pop girl group rose to fame in late 1996 and 1997 and continued until the 2000s.
Then-21-year-old singer Luis Miguel rediscovered the bolero circa 1991, echoing back to the trios of the 1940s with his album &quot;Romance&quot;, making him the biggest international Latin star until the late 1990s.

From early to mid-1990s successful acts such as Selena Quintanilla-Pérez, Thalía, Lynda Thomas, Chayanne, Paulina Rubio and arguably the most successful and influential, Gloria Trevi, became the first 1990s music idols in Latin America, subsequently appeared other successful singers and pop groups, including No Mercy, Shakira, Fey and Enrique Iglesias, they also achieved international success.

Colombian rock singer Shakira, Puerto Rican-American actress Jennifer Lopez, and Spanish singer Enrique Iglesias began to rise into the top of the pop charts by the end of the decade, following Selena&#x27;s assassination.

Ricky Martin eclipsed Luis Miguel as the top Latin star when he performed &quot;The Cup of Life&quot; during the 1999 Grammy Awards, earning him the award for Best Latin Pop Performance. He released his English-language debut album less than half a year later, which featured the international hit, opening track &quot;Livin&#x27; la Vida Loca&quot;.
=== Rock ===

Surge of newfound interest in Spanish-language rock, led by bands like Soda Stereo, Héroes del Silencio, Los Fabulosos Cadillacs, Maná, La Ley, Café Tacuba or Los Tres which gained large international following during this period. Others would follow their footsteps.

Along with the rise of Spanish rock came &quot;rock alternativo&quot;, a Spanish equivalent to alternative rock headed by bands like Los Piojos, Babasónicos and Attaque 77. The &quot;rolinga&quot; or &quot;stone rock&quot; genre also emerged from &quot;rock alternativo&quot;, popularized and headed throughout the entire decade by Viejas Locas. The stone-rock genre would remain popular in the 2000s with the Viejas Locas&#x27; vocalist, Pity Álvarez&#x27;s other band Intoxicados.

=== Salsa ===
During the 1990s, salsa spread from the Caribbean region all over Latin America sharing the dance music niche with cumbia. During this period salsa became also increasingly popular as dance music in the US and Europe.
Beginning in 1990, the salsa romantica that began in the 1980s becomes a standard in tropical music thanks to chart-topping stars mainly from Puerto Rico such as Marc Anthony, Jerry Rivera, Tito Rojas, Víctor Manuelle and Gilberto Santa Rosa.

=== Cumbia ===
In the 1990s, the popularity of cumbia waned in favour of other styles such as salsa but remained relatively strong. In Argentina, Mexico, El Salvador, Colombia and other countries as well synthesizers and elements of electronic music were incorporated into cumbia music, giving birth to cumbia sonidera, cumbia andina mexicana and cumbia villera. The blending of chicha music and cumbia in Peru also gained large popularity.

== Oceania ==

In Australia and New Zealand, the bands INXS and Crowded House, who had risen to international fame in the 1980s, continued their success into the 1990s. However, INXS saw a decline in popularity after the release of 1993&#x27;s &quot;Full Moon, Dirty Hearts&quot;, which did not even reach the US Top 50 and on 22 November 1997, a few months after the release of the band&#x27;s tenth studio album &quot;Elegantly Wasted&quot;, lead singer Michael Hutchence was found dead in a Sydney hotel room. Crowded House released two further albums, 1991&#x27;s &quot;Woodface&quot; and 1994&#x27;s &quot;Together Alone&quot;, which were both successful internationally, but disbanded in 1996 after playing their &#x27;Farewell to the World&#x27; concert at the steps of the Sydney Opera House. Their greatest hits compilation album &quot;Recurring Dream&quot;, released in 1996, debuted at number one in Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom and reached the Top 20 in several European territories. Notable 1990s Australian rock bands include Silverchair, Savage Garden, Bachelor Girl, Powderfinger, and The Living End.

By the mid-1990s, Australian music saw increased exposure in East and Southeast Asia with several newer Australian acts being marketed in those regions. In 1993, Rick Price&#x27;s album &quot;Heaven Knows&quot; reached over 250,000 copies in Asia and its title track reached no. 1 in top 40 radio charts in Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Taiwan. In 1995, Southern Sons topped Philippine radio charts, and Frente! reached platinum in the Philippines and Thailand with the album &quot;Marvin the Album&quot;.

In New Zealand, hip hop group OMC&#x27;s single &quot;How Bizarre&quot; became the most successful New Zealand song in history, reaching number one in several music charts around the world, including Australia, Canada, Ireland, South Africa and Austria. The nineties saw a surge in popularity of alternative rock music in New Zealand, especially the popularity of alternative rock bands from the independent music label Flying Nun Records. Successful alternative rock bands of this era include Straitjacket Fits, Headless Chickens and The Chills. Headless Chickens provided Flying Nun with their first number one New Zealand single in 1994 with their song &quot;George&quot;.

Australian singer Kylie Minogue, who quickly rose to fame in the late 1980s, continued to be popular throughout the decade, most notably with songs &quot;Confide in Me&quot; and &quot;Where the Wild Roses Grow&quot;, which she recorded with Nick Cave. Her younger sister Dannii, launched her music career becoming successful in Australia and the United Kingdom with hits such as &quot;Love and Kisses&quot;, &quot;This Is It&quot;, and &quot;All I Wanna Do&quot;.

The 1990s also saw the emergence of pop/rock singer Natalie Imbruglia mainly thanks to her biggest hit - the cover of the song Torn which became one of the most popular pop songs of the decade.

Other prominent pop singers that emerged during the 1990s included Peter Andre, pop band Human Nature, Tina Arena and R&amp;B/hip-hop artists CDB and Deni Hines.

== Asia ==
Throughout the 1990s, the local music industries across Asia have seen massive growth, despite persistent challenges from piracy. While local acts continue to dominate sales and airplay across the region, the 1990s also saw many Western artists break into the Asian markets, especially in the growing East and Southeast Asian markets.

=== Japanese rock ===
In 1998, Supercar released its influential debut album &quot;Three Out Change&quot;. Characterized as having &quot;almost foundational importance to 21st century Japanese indie rock&quot;, Supercar remained active through 2005 with their later albums containing more electronic rock.

Around the same time, bands such as Quruli and Number Girl had begun heavily influencing Japanese alternative rock. Music critic Ian Martin wrote that, along with Supercar, these groups had demonstrated that &quot;Japanese rock bands could take on the British and American alternative bands of the 1990s at their own game ... and in doing so, they had laid the new ground for Japanese rock to develop in its own way from this point on.&quot;

=== J-pop ===
Tokyo-based noise rock band Melt-Banana became an international touring cult act as well as the Boredoms.

J-Pop was a major trend in the late 1990s. The Japanese record label Avex Trax produced a string of top-charting J-pop artists, including Namie Amuro, Ayumi Hamasaki, and the band Every Little Thing. Hikaru Utada, only 16 at the time, scored her signature hit in 1999 with &quot;Automatic&quot;, which was later covered by Hong Kong singer Kelly Chen. Also in 1999, DA PUMP, a four-member boyband, had a hit with &quot;Crazy Beat Goes On!&quot;, featured in the soundtrack of the year&#x27;s film blockbuster, &quot;Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace&quot;. &quot;Give me a shake&quot;, by girl-band MAX, was also a chart-topper in 1999.

J-pop in the 1990s was significant because of its irresistible inclusion of English lyrics in the songs. Titles of most songs were also often in English. Notable examples include &quot;Feeling good – it&#x27;s paradise&quot; by DA PUMP and &quot;Give me a shake&quot; by MAX. Other J-pop artists, such as Hokkaido two-girl band Kiroro, rarely included English lyrics in their songs.

Some non-Japanese-speaking artists, such as Taiwan&#x27;s Vivian Hsu, also crossed over successfully into J-pop; Hsu&#x27;s band Black Biscuits had a hit single in 1999 in both Japanese and Taiwanese Mandarin with &quot;Bye bye&quot;. Taiwanese singer A-mei recorded a Japanese song on her 1999 album &quot;May I hold you, lover?&quot;.

=== C-pop ===

The 1990s saw a revival of interest in local music in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Singapore. In these four regions alone, local artists outsold foreign artists, especially during the late 1990s.

Three big Taiwanese rockers were household names throughout the 1990s. In 1997, it was Wu Bai; in 1998, the two-piece band Power Station; and in 1999, the veteran pub guitarist/singer Dick Cowboy.

Wu was known for his versatile ability to sing and write songs in Hokkien (&quot;Number one in the world&quot;, &quot;Back to hometown&quot;, &quot;Lonely tree, lonely bird&quot;) as well as Taiwanese Mandarin (&quot;Wanderer&#x27;s love song&quot;, &quot;Crying woman&quot;), and also his poetic lyrics. His compositions were also recorded by other artists such as Hong Kong&#x27;s Jacky Cheung (&quot;If this is not love&quot;), Wakin Chau (&quot;Crying woman&quot;), and Andy Lau (&quot;Number one in the world&quot;, &quot;Lone star tear&quot;), and Taiwan&#x27;s Tarcy Su (&quot;Lazy Man&#x27;s Diary&quot;, &quot;Passive&quot;, &quot;Yellow Moon&quot;).

Power Station, a Taiwanese aboriginal duo from the Paiwan tribe, were well known for their long hair, pitch-perfect two-part vocal harmonies, branded guitars/basses, and electrifying rock anthems. Members Yu Chiu-Hsin and Yen Chih-Lin also enjoyed success as singers of numerous television opening (and occasionally ending) themes throughout 1998 and 1999; they won the Best Theme Song award at the 1999 Star Awards for their song &quot;I can endure the hardship&quot;, opening theme song to the award-winning drama series &quot;Stepping Out&quot;.

Dick Cowboy had been a singer in various pubs in his youth, and was especially known for his covers of songs by A-mei, Phil Chang, and Jeff Chang. In 1999, at the age of 40, his original composition &quot;Forget me or forget him&quot; propelled him to superstardom.

High-voiced male singers were fashionable in Taiwanese pop music in the 1990s. Jeff Chang was the foremost of these. His album &quot;Intuition&quot; (1998) contained the title track, which is his biggest single to date.

Singer-songwriter Panda Hsiung, whose voice was very similar to Chang&#x27;s, had his biggest hit with his original composition &quot;Incomprehensible memories&quot; in 1998, which was featured on the soundtrack of the drama, &quot;Legend of the Eight Immortals&quot;. Panda also had a string of hits throughout 1998 and 1999, including &quot;I Wander Alone&quot;, &quot;River of the Blues&quot;, &quot;Snowbird&quot;, and &quot;The Match Girl&quot;.

Other popular Taiwanese male singers with exceptionally high voices during the 1990s included Chang Yu Sheng, Terry Lin, and Chyi Chin.

The Eurodance craze found its way into the Asian pop market with such singers as Yuki Hsu. Her first big hit, recorded in 1999 when she was only 20, was &quot;Who is bad?&quot;, a cover of Jonny Jakobsen&#x27;s &quot;Calcutta (Taxi taxi taxi)&quot;. Similarly, J-pop became popular in Taiwan and Hong Kong after their songs were translated into Chinese, for instance Kelly Chen&#x27;s &quot;Automatic &quot;, a cover of the Hikaru Utada original; and Rene Liu&#x27;s &quot;Later&quot;, a remake of the Kiroro original.

Hong Kong&#x27;s Four Heavenly Kings – Aaron Kwok, Andy Lau, Jacky Cheung, and Leon Lai – were the undisputed solo artists from Hong Kong in the 1990s. Cheung was also nicknamed the &quot;God of Songs&quot; during this period.

Young Hong Kong singers Daniel Chan, Ronald Cheng, and Gigi Leung had their big breaks in the 1990s. Chan&#x27;s &quot;Only you in my heart&quot;, on the album of the same name, was released in 1997 when Chan was only 22; the song was later selected as the opening theme song of Singaporean TV series, &quot;From the Medical Files&quot; . Chan would also continue to sing a few television opening/ending themes in 1998, including &quot;Lonely nights I&#x27;m not lonely&quot; (from &quot;Stand by me&quot;), &quot;When dreams are discovered&quot; and &quot;Does your heart hurt&quot; (both from &quot;A Piece of Sky&quot;).

Cheng&#x27;s album &quot;I Really Can&quot; was released in 1999 and was his biggest seller to date; his other successful albums included &quot;You Are Not My Dearest Lover&quot; (1997) and &quot;Don&#x27;t Love Me&quot; (1996).

Leung&#x27;s album &quot;Fresh&quot; (1999), along with its title track, was a bestseller upon its release, and the title track remains her signature song.

Julie Su Rui of Taiwan and Anita Mui of Hong Kong, both of them established veteran singers, also had comeback albums in this period. Su&#x27;s album &quot;Love Comes This Way&quot; was released in 1998, and Mui&#x27;s &quot;Intimate Lover&quot;, in 1992.

In late 1999, two Hong Kong veteran singers had chart-topping albums. Jordan Chan&#x27;s album &quot;A Bigger Star&quot; contained the song &quot;I Don&#x27;t Have Such Fate&quot;; while William So&#x27;s album &quot;Loving Someone Is So Hard&quot; contained &quot;You + Me + Heartbroken&quot;, a re-recording of his signature song &quot;Sadder as We Kiss&quot; with new lyrics.

Other Asian singers who had chart-toppers in the 1990s included, among others:
* From Hong Kong: Wakin Chau, Sally Yip, Andy Hui, Samuel Tai, David Lui and Sammi Cheng; 
* From Taiwan: Tarcy Su, CoCo Lee, A-mei, Chao Chuan, Richie Ren and Phil Chang; 
* From Malaysia: Eric Moo, Ah Gu and Auguste Kwan;
* From Singapore: Kit Chan, Mavis Hee and Fann Wong.

The 1990s also saw the death of Taiwanese countertenor singer Chang Yu Sheng, who died in a car accident late in 1997. His protege, aboriginal singer A-mei, recorded the song &quot;Hearing You, Hearing Me&quot; in his memory.

===Filipino pop===
In the early 1990s, the Philippine music market, largely dominated by Western acts, saw the emergence of a local music scene influenced by indigenous styles and instrumentation, as illustrated in the music of artists such as Joey Ayala and Smokey Mountain. By the mid-1990s, an alternative-influenced Pinoy rock scene emerged from the underground, led by bands such as Rivermaya and the Eraserheads. Filipino acoustic and soft rock also became prominent by the mid-1990s, led by bands such as Neocolours, True Faith and Side A. 

Original Pilipino music (OPM), primarily in Tagalog and English and driven by sentimental ballads, remained prominent throughout the 1990s, led by emergent artists from that decade such as Regine Velasquez, Jaya and Jolina Magdangal, as well as established acts from the 1980s such as Sharon Cuneta, Zsa Zsa Padilla, Joey Albert, Donna Cruz and Martin Nievera. Soul, R&amp;B and Latin music became more influential on the OPM sound by the late 1990s.

==Legacy==
In December 1999, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine named Mariah Carey as the Artist of the Decade in the United States. In 1999, Selena was named the &quot;top Latin artist of the &#x27;90s&quot; and &quot;best-selling Latin artist of the decade&quot; by &quot;Billboard&quot;, for her fourteen top-ten singles in the Top Latin Songs chart, including seven number-one hits. The singer also had the most successful singles of 1994 and 1995, &quot;Amor Prohibido&quot; and &quot;No Me Queda Más&quot;.

Reflecting on the decade&#x27;s musical developments in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Consumer Guide: Albums of the &#x27;90s&quot; (2000), music critic Robert Christgau said the 1990s were &quot;richly chaotic, unknowable&quot;, and &quot;highly subject to vagaries of individual preference&quot;, yet &quot;conducive to some manageable degree of general comprehension and enjoyment by any rock and roller.&quot; A 2022 study from research group Luminate revealed that 60% of American music listeners born in the 1990s listened to music from the decade they were born, compared to 53% of those born in the 2000s, 52% of those born in the 1980s, 41% of those born in the 1970s, and 35% of those born in the 1960s.

This article is an overview of the major events and trends in [[popular music]] in the 2000s.

In American culture, various styles of the late 20th century remained popular, such as rock, pop, metal, hip hop, R&amp;B, EDM, country, and indie. As the technology of computers and internet sharing developed, a variety of those genres started to fuse in order to see new styles emerging. Terms like &quot;contemporary&quot;, &quot;nu&quot;, &quot;revival&quot;, &quot;alternative&quot;, and &quot;post&quot; are added to various genre titles in order to differentiate them from past styles, with nu-disco and post-punk revival as notable examples.

The popularity of teen pop carried over from the 1990s with acts such as *NSYNC, Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears, and Christina Aguilera dominating the charts in the earlier years of the decade. Previously established pop music artists such as Michael Jackson and Madonna made a comeback in the early 2000s with successful releases such as &quot;Invincible&quot; and &quot;Music&quot;.
Contemporary R&amp;B was one of the most popular genres of the decade (especially in the early and mid-2000s), with artists like Usher, Alicia Keys, Beyoncé, and Rihanna. In 2004, the &quot;Billboard&quot; Year-End Hot 100 had 15 of its top 25 singles as contemporary R&amp;B.

The decade was dominated by the garage rock revival and the birth of a new indie rock style. In this decade, grime and dubstep were genres invented in the UK, while chillwave became popular in the United States in the latter part of the decade.

In Britain, Britpop, post punk revival, and alternative rock were at the height of their popularity with acts such as Coldplay, The Libertines, Oasis, Travis, Dido, Blur, The Hives, Björk, and Radiohead, which still continued at the top of the major charts in the rest of the world since the 1990s.

Hip hop music achieved major mainstream status after the 1990s including Atlanta, Houston, New Orleans mainstream success. Popular rap movements of the 2000s include crunk, snap, hyphy, and alternative hip hop.

Despite the hip hop dominance, such as Southern hip hop which lasted for most of the decade (particularly the middle years), rock music was still popular, notably alternative rock, and especially genres such as post-grunge, post-Britpop, nu metal, pop punk, emo, post-hardcore, metalcore, and in some cases indie rock; the early and mid-2000s saw a resurgence in the mainstream popularity of pop rock and power pop.

Even though the popularity among the mainstream audience dipped slightly, country music continued to rise in sales, having a strong niche in the music industry. The genre saw the rise of new front-runners like Taylor Swift, Carrie Underwood, and Miley Cyrus, who was able to score top hits on all-genre &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, apart from the country charts, by appealing to a wider audience outside the genre.

Electronic music was also popular throughout the decade; at the beginning of the 2000s, genres such as trance, chillout, house, indietronica, and Eurodance (in Europe) were popular. By the end of the decade, late 1980s/early 1990s inspired dance-oriented forms of electronic music such as synthpop, electropop, and electro house had become popular.

By the end of the decade, a fusion between hip hop and electronic dance similar to the freestyle music of the late 1980s and early 1990s, known as hip house and electrohop also grew successful.

In many Asian musical markets, with the increase of globalization, music became more Westernized, with influences of pop, hip hop, and contemporary R&amp;B becoming ever-present in Eastern markets. American and European popular music also became more popular in Asia.

Genres such as J-pop and K-pop remained popular throughout the decade, proliferating their cultural influence throughout the East and Southeast of Asia. In other parts of Asia, including India, Indian pop music, closely linked to Bollywood films and &quot;filmi&quot; music, was popular alongside Western pop music.

In Latin America, whilst R&amp;B, hip hop, and pop rock did have influence and success, Latin-based pop music remained highly popular.

Reggaetón became a definitive genre in 2000s Latin music, as well as salsa and merengue. Subgenres fusing Latin music such as merengue and reggaetón with hip hop and rap music became popular from the middle of the decade onwards.

In the mid-2000s, Narcocorrido music initially becomes a regional musical preference in many parts of Mexico and the southwestern United States. By 2006-2007 the genre had racked up sales averaging over $2 million per year beginning in 2005. No other regional Mexican music genere had garnered more sales and radio play as did Narcocorridos during this era.

The continued development of studio recording software and electronic elements was observed throughout this decade. One such example is the usage of pitch correction software, such as auto-tune that appeared in the late 1990s. The internet allowed for unprecedented access to music and made it possible for artists to distribute their music freely without label backing. Innumerable online outlets and sheer volume of music also offers musicians more musical influences to draw from.

=== Hip hop ===

Hip hop dominated popular music in the early 2000s. Artists such as Eminem, Outkast, Black Eyed Peas, T.I., 50 Cent, Kanye West, Nelly, Common, Nas, Jay-Z, Busta Rhymes, Puff Daddy, Snoop Dogg, Missy Elliott, M.I.A., Lil&#x27; Kim, Gorillaz, Jeezy, Lil Wayne, Timbaland, The Game, Cam&#x27;ron and Ludacris were among the dominant mainstream hip hop artists to have represented the hip hop genre for the decade. By 1999, more 2000s styled glam started coming in, along with dirty south and crunk, with artists such as Mannie Fresh, Cam&#x27;ron, Lil Jon, Ludacris, Trina, Three 6 Mafia, Ying Yang Twins, Bubba Sparxxx, Neptunes, and Jay-Z. Distinct regional differences also developed outside the hip hop/rap strongholds of the 1990s, New York City and Los Angeles. Though the Los Angeles style of the 1990s waned, gangsta rap continued to be popular through the 2000s, and more commercially oriented party rap dominated the charts. The emergence of hip-hop from the south and the Midwest was starting to take place, and by the end of the decade, hip-hop was starting to spread internationally.During the 2000s, Eminem, who is perhaps best known for being one of the few successful white rappers in the music industry, enjoyed a massive commercial success and maintained commercial relevance by attempting to be controversial and subversive. According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, two of Eminem&#x27;s albums are among the top five highest-selling albums of the 2000s. After the release of his album &quot;Relapse&quot;, Eminem became the best-selling rapper of all time and the top selling artist of the decade across all genres. &quot;Ringtone rap&quot;, which is rap music that was made popular for ringtones, which includes more &quot;laid back&quot; and &quot;silly&quot; elements along with repetitive hooks, became very popular in the later part of the 2000s.

In late 2005, the Southern hip hop subgenre reached the peak of its popularity, especially its sub-subgenres of crunk and snap music (which started the dance craze movement in hip hop from 2005 to 2009). The number one selling crunk artist as well as paving the way to its popularity was Lil Jon who shot to fame in 2003, with his group The East Side Boyz. Then snap music became a staple for the remainder of the decade in hip hop with artists such as, Dem Franchize Boyz, D4L, Yung Joc, Soulja Boy, Unk, Jibbs, Da BackWudz, Purple Ribbon All-Stars, V.I.C., GS Boyz, the Fast Life Yungstaz, New Boyz, and Cali Swag District, to name a few. These artists have all contributed to starting some dance craze accompanied to one of their songs, with the most popular being Soulja&#x27;s &quot;Crank Dat&quot; move, which gained popularity throughout 2007 and 2008. By the end of the decade this sound began to decline in popularity as well as the dance-crazes that came along with them, as pioneer hip hop artists and hip hop purists such as Ice-T and Nas denouncing the crunk and snap craze, with Nas&#x27;s 2006 song &quot;Hip Hop Is Dead&quot; brought dislike to the new path hip hop was directing.

By early 2000, the hyphy movement became popular in Northern California, specifically the Bay Area. Bay Area artists like Mac Dre, Keak Da Sneak, E-40, The Pack, and Too Short were prominent hyphy rappers. Hyphy culture included the use of party drugs like ecstasy, slang terms like &quot;Go dumb&quot; and &quot;yadadamean&quot;, Ghost Riding, and Sideshows.

By mid-2008, the sound began to fade as indie rap and alternative began to come in with artists such as Kid Cudi and The Cool Kids, who fused hip hop with electro and hipster influences. This trend continued on into the early 2010s. Alternative hip hop, almost unknown in the mainstream, except for a few crossover acts, evolved throughout the decade with the help of artists such as Mos Def, Lupe Fiasco, The Roots, MF Doom, Aesop Rock, and Common, who achieved unheard-of success for their field. Throughout the 2000s, alternative hip hop continued its philosophical, positive, and complex lyrical subject matter, while denouncing materialism, fashion, and money. This subgenre also includes spoken word and a branch of slam poetry. The subgenre could be said to be related to both the old school hip-hop culture of the 1980s and 1990s, and the indie rock and hipster subcultures.

Auto-Tune became popular by mid-2007, with R&amp;B artist T-Pain starting the craze. This technology was not exclusively used for hip-hop music, it was used in other genres such as pop, R&amp;B, and EDM. Auto-Tune was popular in the earlier part of the decade as well (primarily in 2000 and 2001), but then only called &quot;synthesizer&quot; and it was used casually as just an effect. Artists such as Daft Punk, Eiffel 65, *NSYNC, 98 Degrees, Willa Ford, and even Faith Hill have used Auto-Tune in their songs. It was first known as the &quot;Cher effect&quot; since it was used in the song &quot;Believe&quot; by Cher in 1998. The Black Eyed Peas began utilizing Auto-Tune and electropop–dance in their most successful album to date, &quot;The E.N.D.&quot;, which spawned five top ten hit singles: &quot;Boom Boom Pow&quot;, &quot;I Gotta Feeling&quot;, &quot;Meet Me Halfway&quot;, &quot;Imma Be&quot;, and &quot;Rock That Body&quot;. Due to hip-hop&#x27;s increased moulding with pop music, some, such as rapper Nas have declared the death of the genre.

=== Rock ===
==== Pop rock ====
In the early 2000s, there was a resurgence of interest in pop rock and power pop. This was kickstarted in the year 2000 with the success of Blink-182&#x27;s song &quot;All the Small Things&quot; and Nine Days&#x27; song &quot;Absolutely (Story of a Girl)&quot;, both of which peaked at No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The trend kicked off the brief musical careers of Ryan Cabrera, Ashley Parker Angel, Teddy Geiger, Evan and Jaron, The Click Five, Jet, and Snow Patrol throughout the early and mid-2000s. This also paved the way for a second wave of pop punk bands such as Good Charlotte, New Found Glory, and Sum 41, who made use of humor in their videos and had a radio-friendly tone to their music. Later pop-punk bands such as Simple Plan, The All-American Rejects, and Fall Out Boy had a sound that had been described as closer to late 1970s and early 1980s hardcore, with similarities to the band Cheap Trick, while still achieving considerable commercial success. In addition, some of the most successful pop-punk bands of the 1990s, such as Green Day, Blink-182, Weezer, and The Offspring continued their success during the early 2000s.

In the early 2000s, the power pop and pop rock trend also spread to women musicians. Michelle Branch became successful in 2001 with her song &quot;Everywhere&quot;. Her success continued with her second album singles &quot;Are You Happy Now?&quot; and &quot;Breathe&quot;. Kelly Clarkson was also another prominent female artist of this movement, rivaling the success of Avril Lavigne. The first winner on the hit reality TV show &quot;American Idol&quot;, Clarkson started off her musical career with contemporary R&amp;B hit songs such as &quot;A Moment Like This&quot; and &quot;Miss Independent&quot; and catapulted to cultural icon status in the mid-2000s with aggressive songs such as &quot;Since U Been Gone&quot; and &quot;Behind These Hazel Eyes&quot;. Clarkson strayed away from this sound in the late 2000s but continued to make pop rock hits. Other female pop rock and power pop artists who experienced Top 40 success in the 2000s included Alanis Morissette, Liz Phair, Ashlee Simpson, and Stacie Orrico.

==== Pop punk ====

After the breakthrough of punk rock in the 1990s, by the 2000s the genre had evolved more into pop punk due to major label records taking interest and signing on bands such as Blink-182. Green Day kick-started the 2000s with the release of their sixth studio album &quot;Warning&quot; in 2000 to lukewarm success. The following year, Blink-182 released their fourth studio album &quot;Take Off Your Pants and Jacket&quot; in 2001 which went on to sell 14 million copies worldwide. It was a commercial and critical success, debuting at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 within its first week of release and securing the status of the pop punk trio as one of biggest bands of the genre. Also in that year, Canadian band Sum 41 released their debut album &quot;All Killer No Filler&quot;, which went platinum in the United States. The second-wave bands dominated the pop punk genre in the early years with bands like Good Charlotte, New Found Glory, Simple Plan, and Sum 41 receiving platinum status and gaining large fan bases worldwide. 
In 2002, Avril Lavigne became popular in the pop punk scene thanks to her pop punk-based sound, and was arguably the most prominent artist to take this new direction in pop music, with hits such as &quot;Complicated&quot; and &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot;. In 2003, Blink-182 released their self-titled album &quot;blink-182&quot;, which demonstrated a darker and more mature tone than previous albums. This was mainly due to the side-project Box Car Racer. Even so, the album was yet another commercial and critical success. It was to be their last album released before taking an indefinite hiatus in 2005. The band would reunite four years later. After their 1994 breakthrough, Green Day&#x27;s fame was fading, mainly due to rising popularity of other bands like Good Charlotte and Sum 41. Realizing this, they retreated to the studio and produced their seventh studio album &quot;American Idiot&quot; released in 2004. It saw a significant sales boost, selling 14 million copies worldwide and awarding the band 3 Grammy awards. Fall Out Boy&#x27;s &quot;From Under the Cork Tree&quot; gained commercial success in 2005 and put the band on the pop punk map. Fall Out Boy&#x27;s follow-up album &quot;Infinity on High&quot; went No.1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in 2007. The last successful pop punk album of the decade was Green Day&#x27;s eighth studio album &quot;21st Century Breakdown&quot; released in 2009 which achieved their best chart performance to date by reaching number one on the album charts of various countries as well as winning a Grammy, including the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the European Top 100 Albums, and the UK Albums Chart.

==== Post-grunge ====
Post-grunge continued to be popular in the 2000s, with the genre reaching its peak in the early years of the decade. Artists include Foo Fighters, Creed, Alter Bridge, Nickelback, Lifehouse, Hoobastank, 3 Doors Down, Puddle of Mudd, Our Lady Peace, Switchfoot, Shinedown, Three Days Grace, Staind, Seether, and Daughtry. These bands took post-grunge into the 21st century with considerable commercial success, at times abandoning the angst and anger of the original movement for more conventional anthems, narratives, ballads and romantic songs.

==== Nu metal ====

During the early 2000s, a new wave of metal began with interest in the newly emerging genre nu metal and genres of a similar style such as rap metal and the later mainstream success rap rock. The popularity of nu metal music carried over from the late 1990s, where it was introduced by early work from bands such as Korn, Deftones, Limp Bizkit, Slipknot, Incubus, Coal Chamber, and Rage Against the Machine into the early 2000s with the similar genre, rap rock, bringing in a wave of monster-hit artists such as System of a Down, Evanescence, P.O.D, Linkin Park, Papa Roach, and Disturbed. 
The success of Korn&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Follow the Leader&quot; and Limp Bizkit&#x27;s &quot;Significant Other&quot; and &quot;Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water&quot;, brought nu metal to the mainstream. Limp Bizkit&#x27;s &quot;Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water&quot; would sell over 1,050,000 in its first weekmaking it the highest selling rock record with first week sales ever. Linkin Park&#x27;s debut album &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;, released in 2000, sold over 24 million copies worldwide. Beginning in 2002, nu metal rapidly began to lose mainstream appeal. Since then, many bands have changed to other genres of music, such as post-grunge (Staind), heavy metal (Slipknot, Disturbed, Drowning Pool), and alternative rock (Linkin Park, Papa Roach).

==== Metalcore ====
By 2004, the up-and-coming genre metalcore was dominated by bands such as Killswitch Engage, Underoath, Bullet for My Valentine, Trivium, and most successfully Avenged Sevenfold, all of whom releasing successful albums.

The rise of metalcore led to increased popularity and exposure of nearly every other subgenre of heavy metal including death metal, black metal, and thrash. In 2002, heavy metal saw a new subgenre called deathcore, which would gain moderate success from 2005 to present day.

==== Hard rock/Heavy metal ====

AC/DC released &quot;Stiff Upper Lip&quot; in 2000 and &quot;Black Ice&quot; in 2008. Guns N&#x27; Roses released the long-awaited &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; in 2008 after over a decade of work by Axl Rose. Metallica released two albums in the 2000s, &quot;St. Anger&quot; in 2003 and &quot;Death Magnetic&quot; in 2008. Aerosmith released the platinum-selling &quot;Just Push Play&quot; in 2001 followed by the blues-infused &quot;Honkin&#x27; on Bobo&quot; in 2004; the band also toured every year of the decade except 2008. 

Bon Jovi released five albums during the decade: &quot;Crush&quot; (2000), &quot;Bounce&quot; (2002), &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot; (2005), &quot;Lost Highway&quot; (2007), and &quot;The Circle&quot; (2009). &quot;Crush&quot; fared best, going double platinum, and spawning the hit &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot;, while &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot; and &quot;Lost Highway&quot; also launched Top 40 singles, went platinum, and saw the band mix hard rock with country. Bon Jovi&#x27;s Lost Highway Tour was the highest-grossing tour of 2008.

==== Emo ====
Emo broke into mainstream culture in the early 2000s with the platinum-selling success of Jimmy Eat World&#x27;s &quot;Bleed American&quot;. The new emo had a far greater appeal amongst adolescents than its earlier incarnations. In the following years, use of the term &quot;emo&quot; expanded beyond the music world, becoming associated with fashion, hairstyle, and other aesthetic attributes of culture. 

Later in the decade, the term &quot;emo&quot; was applied by critics and journalists to a variety of artists, including multi-platinum acts such as Fall Out Boy and My Chemical Romance and disparate groups such as Paramore and Panic! at the Disco, although some artists branded as such rejected the label. Despite its success, the emo genre never quite surpassed post-grunge in popularity during the 2000s.

==== Garage rock, post-punk and new wave revival ====
In the early 2000s, a new group of bands emerged into the mainstream which drew primary inspiration from post–punk and new wave and were variously characterized as part of a garage rock, post–punk, or new wave revival. Because the bands came from across the globe, cited diverse influences (from traditional blues, through new wave to grunge), and adopted differing styles of dress, their unity as a genre has been disputed. There had been attempts to revive garage rock and elements of punk in the 1980s and 1990s and by 2000 scenes had grown up in several countries. The Detroit rock scene included The Von Bondies, Electric Six, The Dirtbombs, and The Detroit Cobras and that of New York which included Radio 4, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and The Rapture. Social networking sites such as Myspace and PureVolume enabled amateur artists to promote their music, and thanks to the internet, many underground unsigned artists become discovered and well known amongst alternative subcultures. The revival hit a peak in 2003–04. Franz Ferdinand from Scotland, also became popular with their debut album in 2004. Though drawing on an indie sound, none of the groups were derivative in a way that could be described as retro. In 2004, Las Vegas-based alternative rock band The Killers released their successful debut album &quot;Hot Fuss&quot;, spawning hits like &quot;Mr. Brightside&quot; and &quot;All These Things That I&#x27;ve Done&quot;. New York-based act The Bravery became popular the following year.

Three of the most successful bands from these scenes were The Strokes, who emerged from the New York club scene with their debut album &quot;Is This It&quot; (2001); The White Stripes, from Detroit, with their third album &quot;White Blood Cells&quot; (2001); and Interpol from New York, with their debut album &quot;Turn On the Bright Lights&quot; (2002). They were christened by the media as the &quot;The&quot; bands, and dubbed &quot;The saviors of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot;, because of their connections with the indie rock underground, leading to accusations of hype. Other popular &quot;The&quot; bands were The Hives, The Vines, and The Darkness; as well as Jet, whose 2003 smash-hit &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl&quot; catapulted to the top of the charts and was frequently used in commercials primarily for music products such as the Apple iPod. Canadian punk band, Sum 41 poked fun at the start of the &quot;The&quot; band craze in their music video for &quot;Still Waiting&quot; in 2003 off the album &quot;Does This Look Infected?&quot; (2002). Will Sasso makes a cameo in the video, coining the band as &quot;The Sums&quot;.

==== Indie rock ====

During the mid-2000s, bands such as Modest Mouse, Death Cab for Cutie and Arcade Fire released indie rock albums that broke into the mainstream and gave indie rock recognition. The late 2000s also saw more indie rock bands such as MGMT, Spoon, Interpol, Tegan and Sara, Wilco, The Decemberists, The White Stripes, The Strokes, Animal Collective, Bright Eyes, Rilo Kiley, She &amp; Him, The New Pornographers, Feist, Cat Power, Grizzly Bear, Arcade Fire, The Shins, The Killers, and Vampire Weekend gain popularity around the world, including in the United States, thanks to the rise of independent internet music blogs. The rising popularity of Internet radio also contributed to high album sales for Indie rock bands, despite little to no mainstream radio play. By the end of the decade several of these bands released albums that topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. This trend has been viewed as heralding a new era for rock in the wake of an era of pop dominance by the likes of Lady Gaga and Katy Perry.

=== Pop ===

Teen pop continued to be an extremely popular genre in the early 2000s with success of teenage pop singers Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. Spears&#x27; &quot;Oops!... I Did It Again&quot; and Aguilera&#x27;s &quot;Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)&quot; became huge hits in the year 2000. By 2001 and 2002, however, the teen-pop trend faded due to modern R&amp;B and hip-hop influenced music that later dominated throughout the middle of the decade. Spears&#x27; 2001 album &quot;Britney&quot; and Aguilera&#x27;s 2002 album &quot;Stripped&quot; are examples of teen pop artists transitioning from teen pop to more grown-up, modern R&amp;B influenced records.Boy bands maintained their popularity during the beginning of the decade, but their popularity also faded, with the exception of Backstreet Boys, who continued their popularity post–2005, (after a short hiatus between 2002 and 2004). As the typical &quot;boy band&quot; sound was no longer mainstream, they began to transition to more of an adult contemporary, soft-rock and ballad styles of music for the remainder of the decade. By 2003, records by boy bands were very sparse on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and some members of boy bands left to pursue other projects and solo endeavors, such as Jesse McCartney from Dream Street, Nick Lachey from 98 Degrees, and most successfully Justin Timberlake from NSYNC, whose foray into Blue-eyed soul R&amp;B/Pop spawned a successful solo career. A new strain of boy bands, such as V Factory, Varsity Fanclub, The Click Five, NLT, and the Jonas Brothers, emerged at the end of the decade, but this new generation of boy bands did not reach the glamor and success of those of the 1990s and early 2000s.

Along with the boy bands, girl groups were popular as well with groups such as The Pussycat Dolls and Destiny&#x27;s Child. Other girl groups included Danity Kane (2005–09), Dream (2000–03), and Sugababes, along with shorter-term girl groups such as No Secrets, A Girl Called Jane, Girlicious, Soluna, and Paradiso Girls.

Pop rock artist Pink, who would go on to be one of the biggest pop singers of the 2000s, released her debut album &quot;Can&#x27;t Take Me Home&quot; in 2000, her second studio album &quot;Missundaztood&quot;, and later, her &quot;I&#x27;m Not Dead&quot; album in which features &quot;Stupid Girls&quot; and &quot;Who Knew&quot;. Her following album, &quot;Funhouse&quot;, released in 2008 also included &quot;So What&quot; and &quot;Sober&quot;. Pink&#x27;s song, &quot;You Make Me Sick&quot;, which debuted January 6, 2001, reached No. 33 on the Hot100 list. &quot;Family Portrait&quot; got up to No. 20, debuting on November 16, 2002.

Singer Anastacia achieved worldwide commercial success with singles such as &quot;Not That Kind&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Outta Love&quot;, &quot;Paid My Dues&quot;, &quot;One Day in Your Life&quot;, and &quot;Left Outside Alone&quot;. She was highly successful in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Asia, South Africa, and South America, but had only minor success in her native United States. She is one of the fastest and biggest-selling artists of the new millennium.

In 2001, triple-threat entertainer Jennifer Lopez debuted at No. 1 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart with her &quot;J.Lo&quot; album and in addition her film, &quot;The Wedding Planner&quot;, opened at No. 1 at the box office at the same time making her the first actress and singer in history to have both a film and an album at No. 1 in the same week.In 2006, Shakira with &quot;Hips Don&#x27;t Lie&quot; became the first South American woman, also one of the few women ever to have a No. 1 single on the official charts of the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Latin charts. The song is regarded as the best-selling single of the decade, and one of the best-selling singles of all time. Her massive crossover success in 2001 generated many global smash hits throughout the decade like &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot;, &quot;La Tortura&quot;, &quot;Hips Don&#x27;t Lie&quot;, &quot;Beautiful Liar&quot;, and &quot;She Wolf&quot;. Shakira also broke the record for the highest-selling Spanish-language album in the United States with &quot;Fijación Oral, Vol. 1&quot;.

Artists such as Madonna, Janet Jackson, Anastacia, Kylie Minogue, Mariah Carey, and Nelly Furtado experienced revived success. Justin Timberlake shot to stardom with his debut solo album, &quot;Justified&quot; (2002). In 2005, Cher ended her 3-year-long Farewell Tour which became the highest grossing female and solo tour at that time. Madonna enjoyed success throughout the decade. Her albums &quot;Music&quot; (2000) and &quot;Confessions on a Dance Floor&quot; (2005) are among the best-selling of the decade. Both were universally acclaimed by critics. The first was also nominated for five Grammy Awards while the second won one. Madonna also had four highly successful tours in the 2000s. The Re-Invention Tour which grossed $125 million in just 56 shows making it the highest grossing of 2004, the Confessions Tour went on to gross over $190 million in 60 shows becoming the highest-grossing tour by a female ever. Her final tour in 2008/09 was Sticky and Sweet Tour which became the highest grossing female tour and the highest grossing solo tour of all-time making $408 million in 85 shows.

Justin Timberlake released his sophomore studio album &quot;FutureSex/LoveSounds&quot; in 2006, producing the chart-topping singles &quot;SexyBack&quot;, &quot;My Love&quot;, and &quot;What Goes Around... Comes Around&quot;, and winning four Grammy Awards for the record.

Fergie released her first solo album in 2006 called &quot;The Dutchess&quot;. The album produced five top five singles in the United States, including three No. 1 hits on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, &quot;London Bridge&quot;, &quot;Big Girls Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;, and &quot;Glamorous&quot;, as well as the No. 2 single &quot;Fergalicious&quot; and the No. 5 single &quot;Clumsy&quot;. All five of the aforementioned singles have sold over 2 million digital downloads each in the United States, thus setting a new record in the digital era for the most multi-platinum singles from one album. &quot;The Dutchess&quot; sold over 6 million copies worldwide becoming one of the most successful albums of the era.

While predominantly focusing on R&amp;B music during this time, Beyoncé also ventured into a pop sound with her third studio album &quot;I Am... Sasha Fierce&quot; in 2008, producing the top-ten singles &quot;Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)&quot; at No. 1, &quot;If I Were a Boy&quot; at No. 3, &quot;Halo&quot; at No. 5, and &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; at No. 10. The album and its accompanying songs won five Grammy Awards, helping Beyoncé set a record for the most Grammy Awards won by a female artist in one night.
Lady Gaga took the latter part of the decade by storm and revived the electronic influence of pop music that had not been prominent since 2000. Her debut album, &quot;The Fame&quot; (2008), reached No. 1 in Canada, Austria, Germany, United Kingdom and Ireland and topped the &quot;&quot;Billboard&quot;&quot; Top Electronic Albums chart. Its first two singles, &quot;Just Dance&quot; and &quot;Poker Face&quot;, became international No. 1 hits, topping the Hot 100 in the United States as well as other countries. The album later earned a total of six Grammy Award nominations and won awards for Best Electronic/Dance Album and Best Dance Recording. By the fourth quarter of 2009, she had released an extended play &quot;The Fame Monster&quot;, with the global chart-topping lead single &quot;Bad Romance&quot;.

In 2001, Michael Jackson, one of popular music&#x27;s most successful artists of all-times, released his final studio album &quot;Invincible&quot;, though it did not receive a lot of exposure compared to previous releases. In 2009, the album was voted by readers of &quot;Billboard&quot; as the Best Album of the Decade.
Michael Jackson died in June 2009, creating the largest public mourning since the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997.

Children&#x27;s music rose significantly in sales, especially with Disney (&quot;The Cheetah Girls&quot;, &quot;High School Musical&quot;, &quot;Hannah Montana: The Movie&quot;, and The Jonas Brothers among others). All &quot;The Cheetah Girls&quot;, &quot;High School Musical&quot; and &quot;Hannah Montana: The Movie&quot; albums were among the best-sellers of 2006 and 2007 and reached the No. 1 position, left many artists produced by Disney in the 2000s, The Cheetah Girls, Hilary Duff, Miley Cyrus, Demi Lovato, Jonas Brothers, Raven-Symoné, the best-selling artists of the decade.

The musical style of the 1980s influenced pop music to some extent in the later stages of the decade, especially around late 2009, as seen in Rihanna&#x27;s hit &quot;SOS&quot; (a sampling of Soft Cell&#x27;s &quot;Tainted Love&quot;), Lumidee&#x27;s &quot;She&#x27;s Like the Wind&quot; and Flo Rida&#x27;s &quot;Right Round&quot;, a reworking of the Dead or Alive hit &quot;You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)&quot;. Other hits include Aaron Carter&#x27;s cover of Bow Wow Wow&#x27;s &quot;I Want Candy&quot;, and Britney Spears&#x27; covers of &quot;My Prerogative&quot; and &quot;I Love Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;. Pop rock groups such as Metro Station, The Veronicas, and Owl City also displayed 1980s influences. Beyoncé&#x27;s hit &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; was not a direct sampling of a 1980s pop hit but Anne Hagerty of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine was quoted as saying, &quot;this track will fit right on a Michael Jackson or Madonna instrumental.&quot; Alien Ant Farm successfully covered Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot;, and Fall Out Boy came out with their own cover of &quot;Beat It&quot;, later on. Bowling for Soup also had a hit with &quot;1985&quot;, a nostalgic ode to the 1980s.

1980s pop star Cyndi Lauper released several albums, experimenting with different styles, like adult contemporary, pop, pop rock, electronic music and blues. These were critically acclaimed and received several nominations for Grammy Award, and Lauper saw significant sales throughout the decade.

=== Adult contemporary ===
The radio format called adult contemporary music (primarily &quot;soft rock&quot; or &quot;lite-rock&quot;), began to somewhat decrease in popularity starting in the late 1990s (due to the increasing popularity of Top 40 music, ho) into January 2000 until September 11, 2001. After 9/11, popularity for Adult Contemporary Music (as well as Contemporary Christian Music crossovers) increased trifold during the grieving process, when the 25–44 Conservative Female Demographic favored listening to songs with appropriate, positive and uplifting lyrics containing love and hope. Upon the eventual return to normalcy after 9/11, the popularity of Adult Contemporary music held steady until about 2003, when Billboard began to change their chart formats. This led to adult contemporary stations to program their music &quot;not-as-soft&quot; or &quot;cheesy&quot; as they used to and ended up substituting the words &quot;soft-rock&quot; with &quot;lite-rock&quot;, which has a more modern-edged connotation. Yet, AC stations remained careful to not cross the Adult Top 40 format line. Because of all these changes, AC Stations slowly increased in popularity.

In the late 2000s, artists like Coldplay, Daughtry, The Fray, Gavin Rossdale Sara Bareilles, Colbie Caillat, Diana Krall, Norah Jones, Kelly Clarkson, Alicia Keys, and Leona Lewis were finding more success crossing over onto the Adult Contemporary charts. AC veterans such as Celine Dion, Rod Stewart, Phil Collins, The Eagles, Cyndi Lauper, Alanis Morissette and Sheryl Crow continued to release music only on the Adult Contemporary formats. There are three songs which experienced longevity atop the chart, &quot;Love Song&quot; by Sara Bareilles, &quot;Bubbly&quot; by Colbie Caillat, and &quot;Breakaway&quot; from Kelly Clarkson spent a longevity 20 weeks atop the chart.

Alicia Keys is considered the most successful R&amp;B singer of the decade with 30 million records sold worldwide. Keys scored hits in the U.S. charts with seven songs on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs and four songs on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 100. She shares a record with Britney Spears, being the only two female singers to have their first four albums debuting in first place in the chart &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 200. Beyoncé would become the third female singer to accomplish this feat in 2011.

Norah Jones is considered the greatest jazz singer of the decade with 37 million records sold worldwide. Her debut album &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; with sold 10 million copies in the U.S. and 20 million worldwide. Jones continued her success with her second album, &quot;Feels like Home&quot;. It became the biggest selling album in one week with 1.9 million copies sold. She released two more bestselling albums in the 2000s, had 3 albums debut in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and won eight Grammys with her debut album and 12 Grammys in total during the decade.
=== Contemporary R&amp;B ===
The continued popularity of contemporary R&amp;B was seen during this decade in the global success of established artists such as Beyoncé, both as a solo artist, and with the help of Destiny&#x27;s Child, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, Mary J. Blige, Craig David and Usher, whose careers began in the 1990s and continued in the dawn of the new millennium. The year 2001, in particular its summer, has been described as a golden age for contemporary R&amp;B and urban soul music, with artists such as Janet Jackson, Jill Scott, Mariah Carey and Destiny&#x27;s Child, who paved the way for Alicia Keys, Blu Cantrell, and the revival of Aaliyah.

Beyoncé was ranked the 4th Artist of the 2000s decade by &quot;Billboard&quot;, and was listed the most successful female artist of the 2000s, as well as the top radio artist of the 2000s. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), also recognized Knowles as the top certified artist of the 2000s. Beyoncé, Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland, better known as Destiny&#x27;s Child is the most successful female R&amp;B group of all time, selling over 50 million records worldwide during the 2000s. The group has many chart topping singles worldwide, such as &quot;Survivor&quot;, &quot;Say My Name&quot;, &quot;Bootylicious&quot;, &quot;Independent Women Part 1&quot; and &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jumpin&#x27;&quot;.

Janet Jackson was awarded the American Music Awards&#x27; Award of Merit in March 2001 for &quot;her finely crafted, critically acclaimed and socially conscious, multi-platinum albums&quot;. She became the inaugural honoree of the &quot;mtvICON&quot; award, &quot;an annual recognition of artists who have made significant contributions to music, music video and pop culture while tremendously impacting the MTV generation.&quot; Jackson&#x27;s seventh album, &quot;All for You&quot;, was released in April 2001, debuting at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Selling 605,000 copies, &quot;All for You&quot; had the highest first-week sales total of her career. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic stated &quot;[Jackson&#x27;s] created a record that&#x27;s luxurious and sensual, spreading leisurely over its 70 minutes, luring you in even when you know better&quot;, and Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented, &quot;[a]s other rhythm and blues strips down to match the angularity of hip-hop, Ms. Jackson luxuriates in textures as dizzying as a new infatuation.&quot; The album&#x27;s title-track, &quot;All for You&quot;, debuted on the Hot 100 at No. 14, the highest debut ever for a single that was not commercially available. Teri VanHorn of MTV dubbed Jackson &quot;Queen of Radio&quot; as the single made radio airplay history, &quot;[being] added to every pop, rhythmic and urban radio station that reports to the national trade magazine Radio &amp; Records&quot; in its first week. The single peaked at number one, where it topped the Hot 100 for seven weeks. It received the 2001 Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording. The second single, &quot;Someone to Call My Lover&quot;, which contained a heavy guitar loop of America&#x27;s &quot;Ventura Highway&quot;, peaked at No. 3 on the Hot 100. &quot;All for You&quot; was certified double platinum by the RIAA and sold more than 9 million copies worldwide.Usher was named the number-one Hot 100 artist of the 2000s decade and the 2nd most successful artist of the 2000s decade. He released the album &quot;Confessions&quot; which went on to become the best-selling album of 2004 and the second best-selling album of the 2000s. He also had the overall total most No. 1 singles of the decade with seven going top. &quot;Confessions&quot; is now certified Diamond by the RIAA. Other emerging acts from the early 2000s include Ashanti, Rihanna, Trey Songz, Cupid, DJ Casper, Ne-Yo, Sisqó, Chris Brown, Bobby V, Keyshia Cole, Pretty Ricky, B2K, Jaheim, Musiq Soulchild, Fantasia, and Ciara.
Singer Mary J. Blige topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 2001 with her smash single, &quot;Family Affair&quot;, taken from hit album &quot;No More Drama&quot;. She scored a big hit with, &quot;Be Without You&quot;, which peaked at No. 3 on the Hot 100. During the 2000s decade, Mary released five platinum albums. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine ranked Blige as the most successful female R&amp;B artist of the past 25 years. The magazine also lists &quot;Be Without You&quot; as the top R&amp;B song of the 2000s, as it spent an unparalleled 15 weeks atop the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.

After experiencing a dominant run of success throughout the 1990s, Mariah Carey experienced a commercial lull with &quot;Glitter&quot; and &quot;Charmbracelet&quot;, the first two albums she released in the 2000s. However, she made an astounding comeback in 2005 with the release of &quot;The Emancipation of Mimi&quot;, which debuted at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart. The album included the No. 1 singles &quot;We Belong Together&quot;, which shattered airplay records and was named the Song of the Decade by Billboard, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget About Us&quot;, as well as &quot;Shake It Off&quot;, which peaked at No. 2 (it was blocked from the No. 1 spot by &quot;We Belong Together&quot;, making Carey the first female artist in &quot;Billboard&quot; history to occupy the top two spots on the Hot 100 as a lead artist). Additionally, Carey&#x27;s 2008 album &quot;E=MC²&quot; spawned her 18th chart-topper, &quot;Touch My Body&quot;, with which she surpassed Elvis Presley to become the solo artist with the most Hot 100 No. 1 songs in history.

=== Country ===
Country music sales continued to rise, as the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 all-genre album chart frequently had albums recorded by country music artists listed; several of those titles were certified double platinum or better, indicating the genre continued to have a strong niche in the music industry.

In 2002, The Statler Brothers retired from music. Jimmy Fortune struck out on his own as a solo artist with the help of The Oak Ridge Boys and continues to record music and tour today.
One of the most successful new artists of the decade was Carrie Underwood. In 2005, the Checotah, Oklahoma, native became the first &quot;American Idol&quot; winner to record primarily country music, instead of pop, rap or rhythm and blues. By the end of the decade, Underwood had amassed eight No. 1 songs on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart, along with numerous awards from the Country Music Association, Academy of Country Music and others.

Country pop, a subgenre which has its roots in the Nashville Sound of the late 1950searly 1960s, continued to flourish in popularity. The most prominent act was Shania Twain, with her album &quot;Up!&quot;, released in 2002. Top performers in the genre included Dixie Chicks, Lonestar, Martina McBride, Tim McGraw, Faith Hill, Keith Urban and Rascal Flatts. In the middle of the decade, an informal group of singers and songwriters called the MuzikMafia formed to promote their mesh of honky-tonk and outlaw brand of country music; the most prominent members were &quot;Big&quot; Kenny Alphin and John Rich (of the duo Big &amp; Rich) and Gretchen Wilson, who enjoyed success in the middle part of the decade.Many non-country artists enjoyed success in the country music during the 2000s. The most successful of these artists has been former Hootie &amp; the Blowfish lead singer Darius Rucker, who had three No. 1 hits in 2008–09: &quot;Don&#x27;t Think I Don&#x27;t Think About It&quot;, &quot;It Won&#x27;t Be Like This for Long&quot; and &quot;Alright&quot;. The Eagles, a California-based country-rock group, had their first major success on the Hot Country Songs chart in more than 30 years in 2007–08 with the songs &quot;How Long&quot; and &quot;Busy Being Fabulous&quot;. Pop-rock singers Michelle Branch and Jessica Harp formed The Wreckers and had two top 10 hits, including the No. 1 hit &quot;Leave the Pieces&quot;. Other non-country artists who had success in the genre were Kid Rock, Sheryl Crow, Robert Plant, Jewel, Jessica Simpson, Bon Jovi and Miley Cyrus.

In the late 2000s, teenager Taylor Swift became the first country act to enjoy widespread mainstream popularity since the 1980s. Her self-titled debut studio album produced several top-ten hits on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart, while her second album &quot;Fearless&quot; spawned two of Swift&#x27;s biggest international hits&quot;Love Story&quot; and &quot;You Belong with Me&quot;both reached the top 5 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 (and atop several of the Hot 100 component charts) after topping the Hot Country Songs chart. At the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, Swift became the first country artist in history to win a VMA award, with &quot;You Belong with Me&quot;. The self-titled album became the longest charting album of the 2000s decade on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, across all music genres. &quot;Fearless&quot; topped the same chart for 11 weeks, a feat that has not been matched by another country album since then. In 2016, &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote that &quot;the country landscape is much different today, thanks in part to Swift and her insistence on following a game plan that many considered unorthodox&quot;, noting the favorable views toward country music since her debut, and reported that following her rise to fame, labels have become more interested in signing young country singers and artists who write their own music.

Not everyone celebrated the success of artists such as Underwood and Swift, reflecting the continued discontent and debate over what constituted &quot;real&quot; country music, a debate that had been on and off since the 1970s. Despite the fact that country music songs had long been crossing over to pop radio (and charting since the start of the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts in 1940), some critics continued to state opinions that the pop-oriented sound was little more than repackaged pop music. In 2009, legendary country music artist George Jones proclaimed that &quot;they&#x27;ve (the new artists) stolen our identity. ... They had to use something that was established already, and that&#x27;s traditional country music. So what they need to do really, I think, is find their own title, because they&#x27;re definitely not traditional country music.&quot; In addition, several forums, including the classic country-oriented Pure Country Music Web site, regularly included posts that were openly critical of artists such as Swift and Rascal Flatts. Songs such as &quot;Murder on Music Row&quot; (by George Strait and Alan Jackson) and &quot;Too Country&quot; (by Brad Paisley) gained widespread acceptance and radio airplay, despite criticism in the lyrics over the eschewing of traditional sounds by radio programmers.

However, traditional country music retained a large following during the decade, thanks to the ongoing successes of veteran artists such as Strait, Jackson, Reba McEntire, Brooks &amp; Dunn, Toby Keith and Kenny Chesney, and newer artists such as Paisley, Blake Shelton and Billy Currington. McEntire&#x27;s success came with two albums hitting No. 1 on the all-genre &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart (&quot;&quot; and &quot;Keep On Loving You&quot;), and at the end of the decade had her biggest hit of her career (&quot;Consider Me Gone&quot;). Rogers, Parton and Willie Nelson, all artists who had No. 1 country hits as far back as the early 1970s, all had No. 1 songs during the 2000s decade. In addition, veteran songwriters such as Bill Anderson and Bobby Braddock also enjoyed continued success with newly written songs. Late in the decade, newcomers such as Jamey Johnson and Miranda Lambert were widely hailed for their songwriting and performance talents.

The legendary group Alabama retired from touring in 2004 after nearly a quarter century of mainstream success, primarily during the 1980s and 1990s. Its band memberscousins Randy Owen, Teddy Gentry and Jeff Cook; and drummer Mark Herndonremained active performers and recorded a successful series of albums containing gospel and traditional old-time songs.

Many legendary country music figures died during the decade. Some of the more prominent names included Pee Wee King, Chet Atkins, Waylon Jennings, June Carter Cash, Johnny Cash, Skeeter Davis, Buck Owens, Hank Thompson, Porter Wagoner, Eddy Arnold, Jerry Reed, Vern Gosdin and Hank Locklin.

=== Electronic music ===

In Europe, trance music and house music started to gain popularity in the 2000s, prominently progressive trance and progressive house where popular throughout the 2000s. Hard house became the next big craze after trance in 2001, with a certain amount of cross-over between the two genres (in some cases creating hard trance tracks), but this style diminished in as the decade later wore on. As a kind of backlash, ambient, chillout music achieved mainstream popularity in the early 2000s, with a successful market of chillout compilations and the genre even making it into television commercials and soundtracks.
Popular electronic artists of the decade included Deadmau5, LCD Soundsystem, Owl City and Kaskade.

Disco house and funky house, popular in the late 1990s, continued to be successful through to the mid-2000s before the sound of electro house developed in late 2006. The electro sound began to merge with other genres such as hip hop as the decade drew to a close.

From 2007, dance music started gaining popularity in North America with dance-pop hits by artists such as the pop singer Rihanna&#x27;s song &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop the Music&quot; and &quot;Disturbia&quot;. Hilary Duff in her album &quot;Dignity&quot; has changed her style from pop rock to the more contemporary electropop, to go with the current trends.

In 2008 and 2009, electropop and nu-disco increased in popularity in North America, replacing hip-hop and R&amp;B as the dominant genres of music. Artists like Britney Spears, Beyoncé, and Lady Gaga brought this style to great popularity towards the end of 2008 with their hits such as Britney&#x27;s &quot;Womanizer&quot;, Beyoncé&#x27;s &quot;Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)&quot; and Gaga&#x27;s &quot;Poker Face&quot;. Furthermore, Madonna&#x27;s singles such as &quot;Hung Up&quot; (No. 1 in 45 countries) and &quot;4 Minutes&quot; (No. 1 in 32 countries) become huge dance hits.

Pop duo Aly &amp; AJ explored electropop and 1980s new wave influences in their second album &quot;Insomniatic&quot;. In addition, some of the most successful electronica American artists and DJs in the 1990s, such as Moby and The Crystal Method, also continued their success during the 2000s.

=== Jazz ===
In the 2000s, straight-ahead jazz continued to appeal to a core group of listeners. Well-established jazz musicians, such as Dave Brubeck, Wynton Marsalis, Sonny Rollins, Wayne Shorter or Kenny Barron continue to perform and record. In the 2000s, a number of young musicians emerged, including the pianist Jason Moran, vibraphonist Stefon Harris, trumpeter Roy Hargrove, and bassist Christian McBride.

In addition, a number of new vocalists have achieved popularity with a mix of traditional jazz and pop/rock forms, such as Diana Krall, Norah Jones, Cassandra Wilson, Kurt Elling, and Jamie Cullum. Norah Jones and Diana Krall, due to their massive international success during the 2000s are considered the first and second most successful female jazz singers of the decade, respectively. Diana Krall has topped the Music &quot;Billboard&quot;s multiple times in the year 2000. The week of April 15, 2000, Krall&#x27;s album &quot;When I Look in Your Eyes&quot; reached number one, followed by Al Jarreau&#x27;s &quot;Tomorrow Today&quot; and Kenny G&#x27;s &quot;Classics in the Key of G&quot;. Norah Jones was named the top jazz artist of the 2000–2009 decade by &quot;Billboard&quot;. Jones had many albums come out in the 2000s decade, including jazz and adult contemporary. These include &quot;Come Away with Me&quot; in 2002, &quot;New York City&quot; in 2003, and &quot;Feels Like Home&quot; in 2004.

=== Reggae ===
====Dancehall====

The early 2000s saw the success of older and newer charting acts such as Baha Men, Sean Kingston, Elephant Man, Akon, and Sean Paul, who has achieved mainstream success in the U.S. and has produced several top 10 &quot;Billboard&quot; hits, including &quot;Gimme the Light&quot;, &quot;We Be Burnin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;(When You Gonna) Give It Up to Me&quot;, and &quot;Break It Off&quot; (a duet with Rihanna). He has also had several No. 1 singles, &quot;Get Busy&quot;, &quot;Temperature&quot; and &quot;Baby Boy&quot; (a duet with Beyoncé).

====Reggaetón====

Reggaetón gained mainstream exposure and massive popularity in North America during the mid-2000s. Reggaetón blends West-Indian music influences of reggae and dancehall with those of Latin America, such as bomba, plena, salsa, merengue, latin pop, cumbia and bachata as well as that of hip hop, contemporary R&amp;B, and electronica. The influence of this genre has spread to the wider Latino communities in the United States, as well as the Latin American audience. Shakira has sold more than 100 million copies in the 21st century.

=== Christian music ===
Christian music continued to gain popularity after its success in the 1990s with acts such as Jars of Clay and Audio Adrenaline. Relient K&#x27;s work in the pop punk/pop rock scene earned them three albums certified gold&quot;The Anatomy of the Tongue in Cheek&quot;, &quot;Two Lefts Don&#x27;t Make a Right...but Three Do&quot;, and &quot;Mmhmm&quot;and a Grammy nomination. Skillet recorded two Grammy-nominated albums&quot;Collide&quot; and &quot;Comatose&quot;and achieved Platinum-selling status with &quot;Awake&quot;, and Gold with &quot;Comatose&quot;.

In the early and mid-2000s, British Indie rock groups such as The Libertines, Arctic Monkeys, Bloc Party and Kaiser Chiefs witnessed commercial and chart success not seen by guitar music since Britpop in the 1990s. Regional indie rock scenes such as New Yorkshire also appeared at this point in the decade. Indie music itself increased in popularity due to the increased commercialization of alternative, and major labels begin marketing indie bands with mainstream appeal. American indie/rock band The Killers also became very popular in Britain with their singles &quot;Mr. Brightside&quot;, &quot;When You Were Young&quot;, and &quot;Smile Like You Mean It&quot;.

Radiohead enjoyed further success in the 2000s, moving away from their experimental sound of the &quot;Kid A&quot;/&quot;Amnesiac&quot; era to a more &quot;typical&quot; Alternative rock sound. Muse saw a similar level of commercial acclaim, with the rock trio releasing three chart-topping albums.

Audience-voted reality talent shows became very popular with UK TV audiences in the 2000s. Such programs included &quot;Popstars&quot;, &quot;Pop Idol&quot;, &quot;Fame Academy&quot; and &quot;The X Factor&quot;, and many contestants progressed onto mainstream chart success. The Eurovision Song Contest also retained its important status within European music.

1980s female pop stars Madonna and Kylie Minogue enjoyed a large presence on the European music scene, both having numerous hits in the 2000s including &quot;Music&quot;, &quot;Hollywood&quot;, &quot;Hung Up&quot;, and &quot;Celebration&quot; for Madonna, and &quot;Spinning Around&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot;, &quot;Slow&quot;, and &quot;In My Arms&quot; for Kylie. Britney Spears retained a huge impact throughout the continent and was one of the most successful artists of the decade in that region.
In 2004, Moldovan pop music trio O-Zone&#x27;s hit single &quot;Dragostea Din Tei&quot; witnessed major European and international success. Later in the decade, Romanian pop/dance singer Inna spawned a European hit single with &quot;Hot&quot; and became the first Romanian internationally known female star in modern history. When American boy band Backstreet Boys returned to the music scene in 2005 with a more adult rock sound, some of their 1990s contemporaries from Europe followed. Take That reunited in 2006 without Robbie Williams and managed to recreate their earlier success. Bands such as Boyzone also experienced second-time success, whilst others of the same era such as 5ive and East 17 did not and subsequently disbanded. The Irish boy band Westlife were very successful and emerged as the top selling Irish group of the decade with 44 million records sold and a number of record-breaking hit singles and albums.

Media commentators did however observe during the 2000s that electronic dance music had returned somewhat to the &quot;underground&quot;, with mainstream commercial interest in the genre waning following its peak in the 1990s. This was symbolized in the Brit Awards&#x27; decision in 2004 to remove its &quot;Best Dance Act&quot; category.

Electro, as well as house, became mainstream in the dance music scene in the middle of the decade, replacing the mainstream of more jazzy and Latin influenced sounds from the beginning of the decade. Electro house artists such as Benny Benassi, Bob Sinclar and MSTRKRFT gained popularity in clubs around the world. Dubstep and bassline house achieved more mainstream success within the dance music scene, with artists like Skream and T2 becoming well known.

=== Pop ===

The Colombian Latin pop singer Shakira&#x27;s breakthrough in the early 2000s led to her major international success in many non-Spanish-speaking countries, especially the United States in addition to the music scene of Latin America.

In 2002, the New York-based group Aventura would reinvent bachata, thus making it a dominant Latin genre. By 2004, reggaetón would become a staple in music with acts such as Don Omar, Daddy Yankee, Ivy Queen and Wisin &amp; Yandel. By the mid-2000s, reggaetón had replaced salsa, merengue and cumbia as the main dance genre in nightclubs for young people all over Latin America, reaching popularity in parts of Spain and Italy as well. But by the end of 2007, this craze soon declined in popularity.

=== Salsa and merengue ===
Although salsa and merengue began to decline in popularity, merengue would have new life injected thanks to the subgenre known as, &quot;merengue de calle&quot; (or street merengue). Beginning in 2004, this subgenre combining elements of merengue, rap, and reggaetón would be popularized by Dominican acts such as Omega, Silvio Mora, El Sujeto, and Tito Swing.

== Asia ==

With the rapid development of Asian economies during the 1990s and 2000s, the independent music industries of Asia have seen considerable growth. Asian countries like Japan, China, and India have some of the largest music markets in the world. Supported by their large markets, the music charts in Asia are largely dominated by local Asian artists, with very few artists from the Western world managing to break into those markets.

J-pop and K-pop have become increasingly influenced by contemporary R&amp;B, hip hop music and Eurobeat, and they have become popular all over the Far East region. Meanwhile, in the Southern Asia region, the rising independent Indian pop scene, often characterized by its fusion of Indian and non-Indian sounds, has begun to increasingly compete with the popularity of Bollywood &quot;filmi&quot; music in the region. In Southeast Asia, especially Singapore and Indonesia, straight-ahead jazz saw a revival in the second half of the decade. P-pop refers to contemporary pop music in the Philippines originating from the OPM genre. With its beginnings in the late 1970s, Pinoy pop is a growing genre in the year of 2020s. From the 1990s to the 2000s, OPM pop was regularly showcased in the live band scene.

=== C-pop ===

The appearance of Hong Kong national William Hung on &quot;American Idol&quot; in 2004, proved to be very popular with many locals of East Asia and Southeast Asia. This resulted in a new generation of young local artists, both solo singers as well as bands, having hit records during this period. Later in 2004, Hung would hold his first solo concert at the Esplanade Theatre in Singapore.Taiwanese boy band F4&#x27;s first big hit &quot;Meteor Rain&quot;, from the album of the same name, established them as the dominant boyband of the first half of the decade. The four members of F4 also had solo hits, such as Jerry Yen&#x27;s &quot;One Metre&quot;, Vanness Wu&#x27;s &quot;My Friend&quot; (an adaptation of the Robert Burns poem &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot;), Ken Chu&#x27;s &quot;Never Stopping&quot;, and Vic Chou&#x27;s &quot;Make a wish&quot;.

Jay Chou&#x27;s first solo album &quot;Jay&quot; in 2000, showcased a unique fusion of Asian music with American R&amp;B. Chou would go on to become the dominant force in Asian music for almost all of the 2000s and the first half of the next decade.
Among solo female artists of the 2000s, Stefanie Sun of Singapore was the most outstanding. Her 2000 eponymous debut album featured a remake of an old Hokkien pop song, &quot;Cloudy Day&quot;; and it earned her a Golden Melody Award for Best New Artist.Singer-songwriter-guitarist Tanya Chua was successful during this period as a leading Mandopop artist. Her 2000 album &quot;I Do Believe&quot; garnered a nomination for Best New Artist at the Golden Melody Awards. Chua also wrote songs or produced albums for several other established singers during this period, for instance, &quot;Wrong Number&quot; for Faye Wong.
The most popular girl group of this period was S.H.E, comprising Selina Jen, Hebe Tien, and Ella Chen. Their first big hit, from their fourth album &quot;Super Star&quot;, was their cover of the Bee Gees&#x27; &quot;I.O.I.O.&quot;. In Taiwan alone, 250,000 copies of &quot;Super Star&quot; were sold.

In the second half of the decade, straight-ahead jazz saw a surge of popularity in Asia, in particular after the release in 2006 of the debut album, &quot;Let Me Sing!&quot;, from 15-year-old Indonesian jazz virtuoso Nathan Hartono. Singapore-based wind orchestra The Philharmonic Winds, formed at the beginning of the decade, also played a major part in the revival of jazz in Asia. In 2009, Singapore&#x27;s Esplanade Theatre would found its own jazz festival especially meant for young bands and artistes; it was originally called Bright Young Things, but it would later be renamed Mosaic Jazz Fellows.

Contemporary Christian music artistes also found their way into Asian secular music charts for the first time ever during the 2000s. Mi Lu Bing was a three-piece band that had originally started out playing for worship in their church, but later would release secular-themed albums and songs, including their opening and ending theme songs to the 2007 local television serial, &quot;The Golden Path&quot;. Sun Ho had been the worship pastor at megachurch City Harvest Church before she released her first album of secular material, &quot;Sun With Love&quot;, in 2002. She would go on to release another four albums between 2003 and 2007, although her secular music career eventually came to an abrupt ending with the City Harvest Trial.

Taiwanese supergroup SuperBand, comprising Wakin Chau, Jonathan Lee, Chang Chen-yue, and Lo Ta-Yu, emerged in 2008 and went on to hold several concerts and release two studio EPs of new material, &quot;Northbound&quot; (2009) and &quot;Go South&quot; (2010), before finally resuming their individual solo careers in 2010.

2003 saw the deaths of Hong Kong popular singers Leslie Cheung, 46, who committed suicide; and Anita Mui, 40, who died of cervical cancer. Both singers were highly respected in Cantopop music.

=== J-pop ===

Japanese Pop&#x27;s popularity continued to expand through Asia and the rest of the world, with various Japanese artists debuting in the U.S. J-pop starts to enjoy a relatively big global online fan base. At the end of the decade, dance music and techno become the most popular genres. Bubblegum pop remains popular during the entire decade. Ayumi Hamasaki was one of the most popular Japanese stars of the 2000s, known as &quot;The Empress of Japanese Pop&quot;. Ken Hirai was the most popular male solo artist. 1990s divas like Namie Amuro, Misia, and Hikaru Utada remained popular during this era, with Utada having a second popularity boom in 2008. Starlet Kumi Koda became popular in this era, due to her provocative dance moves. Boy bands were the most popular musical format, with girl bands like Morning Musume experiencing a decline in popularity. Johnny&#x27;s boy bands, notably Arashi, became very popular. Vocal groups like Exile and Tohoshinki gained popularity and pop/rock bands like Mr. Children, Tokio and Glay remained popular. English pop music&#x27;s popularity expanded with popular U.S. artists receiving success such as Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears two of the most successful non-Japanese artists.

=== K-pop ===
By the beginning of the 21st century, the K-pop market had slumped and early K-pop idol groups that had seen success in the 90s were on the decline. H.O.T. disbanded in 2001, while other groups like Sechs Kies, S.E.S., Fin.K.L, Shinhwa, and g.o.d became inactive by 2005. 
Solo singers like BoA, Rain, and Lee Hyori grew in success. However, the success of the boy band TVXQ after its debut in 2003 marked the resurgence of idol groups to Korean entertainment and the growth of K-pop as part of &quot;Hallyu&quot;. The birth of second-generation K-pop was followed with the successful debuts of SS501, Super Junior, BigBang, Wonder Girls, Girls&#x27; Generation, Kara, Shinee, 2NE1, 4Minute, T-ara, f(x), and After School.

=== Indian pop ===

The Indian music industry was previously dominated by the &quot;filmi&quot; music of Bollywood for much of the late 20th century. The 2000s saw increasing popularity of independent Indian pop music that could compete with Bollywood film music. Indian pop music began distinguishing itself from mainstream Bollywood music with its fusion of Indian and non-Indian sounds, which later had on influence an Bollywood music itself. Indian pop has itself been partly influenced by the Asian Underground scene emerging in the United Kingdom among British Asian artists such as Bally Sagoo, Apache Indian, Panjabi MC, Raghav and the Rishi Rich Project (featuring Rishi Rich, Jay Sean and Juggy D). India has one of the largest music markets in the world, though like other developing nations, suffers from high levels of piracy.

Indian music has also had an increasing influence on popular music in the Western world. The music of South Asia has influenced Europe&#x27;s pop mainstream as acts like Björk, Bananarama, Erasure, and Siouxsie and the Banshees all released singles or remixes featuring South Asian instrumentation. Indian music has also influenced mainstream American hip hop, R&amp;B and urban music in the 2000s, including artists/producers such as Timbaland, Jay-Z, Dr. Dre, Truth Hurts, The Black Eyed Peas, Missy Elliott and Britney Spears. According to DJ Green Lantern, &quot;Indian beats have now become a fixture on the R&amp;B scene&quot;. Several Hollywood musical films such as &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; have incorporated Bollywood songs, while several Indian music composers have gained international fame, particularly A. R. Rahman who, having sold over 300 million records worldwide, is one of the best-selling music artists of all time. M.I.A., a British-born Sri Lankan electronic artist incorporates Bollywood songs in her music.

=== Indo pop ===
In the early until the middle of 2000s, the most popular music genre in Indonesia was pop and pop rock music. Some group bands like Slank, Dewa 19, Sheila on 7, Padi, Noah, Radja, ST12, Ungu were top bands and their songs were the most played songs by teens and young adults. Some of these 2000s bands&#x27; most popular songs were Sheila on 7&quot;Sebuah Kisah Klasik&quot;, Dewa 19&quot;Separuh Nafas&quot;, Padi&quot;Menanti Sebuah Jawaban&quot;, Peterpan/Noah&quot;Ku Katakan Dengan Indah&quot;, etc.

=== P-pop ===
In the early 1970s, Pinoy music or Pinoy pop emerged, often sung in Tagalog. It was a mix of rock, folk and ballads making political use of music similar to early hip hop but transcending class. The music was a &quot;conscious attempt to create a Filipino national and popular culture&quot; and it often reflected social realities and problems. As early as 1973, the Juan de la Cruz Band was performing &quot;Ang Himig Natin&quot; (&quot;Our Music&quot;), which is widely regarded as the first example of Pinoy rock. &quot;Pinoy&quot; gained popular currency in the late 1970s in the Philippines when a surge in patriotism made a hit song of Filipino folk singer Heber Bartolome&#x27;s &quot;Tayo&#x27;y mga Pinoy&quot; (&quot;We are Pinoys&quot;). This trend was followed by Filipino rapper Francis Magalona&#x27;s &quot;Mga Kababayan Ko&quot; (&quot;My Countrymen&quot;) in the 1990s and Filipino rock band Bamboo&#x27;s &quot;Noypi&quot; (&quot;Pinoy&quot; in reversed syllables) in the 2000s. Nowadays, &quot;Pinoy&quot; is used as an adjective for some terms highlighting their relationship to the Philippines or Filipinos. Pinoy rock was soon followed by Pinoy folk and later, Pinoy jazz. Although the music was often used to express opposition to then Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos and his use of martial law and the creation of the Batasang Bayan, many of the songs were more subversive and some just instilled national pride. Perhaps because of the culturally affirming nature and many of the songs seemingly being non-threatening, the Marcos administration ordered radio stations to play at least oneand later, threePinoy songs each hour. Pinoy music was greatly employed both by Marcos and political forces who sought to overthrow him.

== Middle East and Africa ==
Music charts in the Middle East are largely dominated by local Arabic-language artists, with an equivalent population of Western world artists as well. The music industry within the Middle East and Africa is international and diverse.

=== Afrobeats ===

Styles of music that make up afrobeats largely began sometime in the late 90s and early-mid-2000s. With the launching of MTV Base Africa in 2005, West Africa was given a large platform through which artists could grow. Artists such as MI Abaga, Naeto C and Sarkodie were among the first to take advantage of this, however most of the artists were merely making interpretations of American hip hop and R&amp;B. Prior to this, groups such as Trybesmen, Plantashun Boiz, and The Remedies were early pioneers that fused modern American influences from hip-hop and R&amp;B with local melodies. While this allowed them to build local audiences, it blocked them from a wider platform due to the language barriers in-place. P-Square released their album &quot;Game Over&quot; in 2007, which was unique for its usage of Nigerian rhythms and melodies. Meanwhile, artists such as Flavour N&#x27;abania were able to find success by embracing older genres, such as highlife, and remixing it into something more modern. By 2009 artists within the burgeoning scene were beginning to become stars across the continent and beyond. The style of music had a variety of names which made it difficult to market outside of Africa.
=== Arabic pop music ===
Arabic pop is mainly produced and originated in Cairo, Egypt; as Egyptian music genre is by far the most widespread within the region. Also Beirut, Lebanon, and Gulf states come as secondary centers. It is an outgrowth of the Arabic film industry (mainly Egyptian movies), also predominantly located in Cairo. Since 2000, various locations in the Gulf countries have been producing Khaleeji pop music. The primary style is a genre that synthetically combines pop melodies with elements of different Arabic regional styles, called &quot;ughniyah&quot; (Arabic: أغنية) or in English &quot;song&quot;. It uses a wide variety of instruments, including electric guitars or electronic keyboards, as well as traditional Middle Eastern instruments like the oud, darbukka or qanun and many more. Another characteristic aspect of Arabic pop is the overall tone and mood of the songs. The majority of the songs are in a minor key, and the lyrics tend to focus on longing, melancholy, strife, and generally love issues.

Although tame by Western standards, female Arab popstars have been known to cause controversy with their sexuality. Playful lyrics, skimpy costumes, and dancing have led to quite a bit of criticism in the more conservative Islamic circles. Artists such as Lydia Canaan, Samira Said, Nancy Ajram, Nawal El Zoghbi, Latifa, Assala, Amal Hijazi and Haifa Wehbe have all come under fire at one time or another for the use of sexual innuendos in their music. This has led to bans on their music and performances in certain countries; particularly in Haifa&#x27;s case. Lydia Canaan&#x27;s provocative costumes made her a sex symbol. &quot;The Daily Star&quot; wrote: &quot;On stage, with her daring looks and style, Canaan became a role model&quot;. In 2002, a video by Samira Said called &quot;Youm Wara Youm&quot; was banned by the Egyptian Parliament for being &#x27;too sexy&#x27;, similar to Nancy Ajram&#x27;s music video &quot;Akhasmak Ah&quot;. In addition Amal Hijazi&#x27;s music video of &quot;Baya al Ward&quot; was heavily criticised and banned on a few music channels. Such extremes are rare, but such kinds of censorship are not uncommon for Arab female popstars.
=== Drum and bass ===
The South African drum and bass scene began in the mid nineties. In 2000, events such as Homegrown became a prominent fixture in Cape Town and a launching platform for international and local artists such as Counterstrike, SFR, Niskerone, Tasha Baxter, Anti Alias and Rudeone. Other regular events include It Came From The Jungle in Cape Town and Science Friksun in Johannesburg.

A weekly Sublime drum and bass radio show is hosted by Hyphen on Bush Radio.

=== Hip hop ===

==== Botswana ====
Phat Boy etc. has done a lot to promote Botswana hip hop. The hip hop movement in Botswana has grown over the years as evidenced by the release over the years of albums and songs from artists such as Mr Doe, Zeus, Touch Motswak Tswak, Ignition, S.C.A.R, Awesomore.aka Gaddamit, Cashless Society, Nitro, Konkrete, HT, Flex, Dice, Dj Dagizus, 3rd Mind, Kast, Nomadic, and Draztik to name a few. The release of hip hop albums is slow because of the small market and competition from other genres of mostly dance-oriented music. Since 2000 hip hop has achieved more prominence in Botswana, with rappers like Scar Kast and Third Mind releasing relatively successful albums. In 2006, Scar released his sophomore offering, &quot;Happy Hour&quot;. The same year Kast released &quot;Dazzit&quot;. S.C.A.R has since won a Channel O Spirit of Africa Award 2007 for best hip hop.
==== Côte d&#x27;Ivoire ====
Ivorian hip hop became a mainstream part of the popular music of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire beginning in 2009 after the victory of Ivorian hip hop group Kiff No Beat at the hip-hop contest Faya Flow, and has been fused with many of the country&#x27;s native styles, such as zouglou. There is a kind of gangsta rap-influenced Ivorian hip hop called &quot;rap dogba&quot;. Ivorian Hip Hop is mostly in the French language, but includes nouchi (Ivorian Slang).

==== Madagascar ====
On 21 June 2007, UNICEF chose a 15-year-old Malagasy rap star, Name Six as its first-ever Junior Goodwill Ambassador for Eastern and Southern Africa. The young rapper&#x27;s work continues the genre&#x27;s tradition of social critique and political commentary, focusing largely on the challenges faced by children in underprivileged communities in Madagascar and voicing the views and concerns of the young, who are routinely omitted from political decision-making processes.
==== Malawi ====
Hip hop culture in Malawi is relatively young. Notable rappers who were early on the scene include Criminal A, Bantu Clan, Real Elements, Dynamike, Dominant 1, Knight of the Round Table, and Wisdom Chitedze. The scene started to gain traction in the late 90s and expanded further in the early 2000s when cheap computers and recording gear became widely available to artists. The launch of Television Malawi in 1999 provided a platform for rappers to have their music videos beamed to a national audience. The music video to Wisdom Chitedze&#x27;s song Tipewe was on regular rotation on the station in its early days. In the early to mid-2000s artists such as Nospa G, M Krazy, David Kalilani, and Gosple helped push the music further. A lot of Malawi&#x27;s early hip hop music contained social commentary, religious, and introspective themes.

By the late 2000s the scene had picked up further with artists such as Barry One, Basement, Mandela Mwanza, Hyphen, Fredokiss, and Tay Grin gaining notoriety. Tay Grin&#x27;s music video for the song Stand Up was featured considerably on Channel O. He was not the first Malawian rapper to get his song on that station; that accolade goes to the Real Elements. However, Tay Grin&#x27;s got much more airplay. In 2009, Phyzix released his debut studio album The Lone Ranger LP which contained the hit singles Cholapitsa and Gamba. Around the same time, Christian rap started to gain popularity and that movement was spearheaded by Manyanda Nyasulu, DJ Kali, KBG, Double Zee, Liwu, C-Scripture, Asodzi, Erasto, and Sintha.

==== Niger ====
Hip hop groups began to appear and perform in Niamey in 1998. In August 2004, UNICEF opened its &quot;Scene Ouverte Rap&quot;, where 45 new groups entered selections among an informal count of 300 existing groups. Shows took place at Niamey&#x27;s Jean Rouch Centre Culturel Franco – Nigerien (CCFN) in August 2004.

==== Palestine ====

Ramallah Underground, based in Ramallah, Palestine, was a musical collective born from the desire to give voice to a generation of Palestinians and Arabs, in a situation of great economic, artistic, and political difficulty. The collective was founded by artists Stormtrap and Boikutt, later joined by Aswatt, who aim to rejuvenate Arabic culture by creating &quot;music that Arabic youth can relate to,&quot; in the words of Boikutt. They rapped in Arabic, and were credited as some of the founders of Palestinian hip-hop. Their music combines hip-hop, trip hop, and downtempo, besides more traditional Middle-Eastern music. Their MySpace page led David Harrington of the Kronos Quartet to ask them to collaborate on a piece, &quot;Tashweesh,&quot; composed by Boikutt, which was included on the quartet&#x27;s 2009 release &quot;Floodplain&quot;.

==== Uganda ====
In 2003 Geoffrey Ekongot, Saba Saba aka Krazy Native, of the Bataka Squad, Francis Agaba, the late Paul Mwandha of Musicuganda.com, and Xenson formed the Uganda Hip Hop Foundation. In 2003, the Foundation hosted the first Ugandan Hip Hop Summit and concert at Club Sabrina&#x27;s in Kampala. It was so successful that they have hosted it every year for the past four years. In 2005 the Bavubuka All Starz was formed under the leadership of Silas aka Babaluku of the Bataka Squad, with the mission of bringing hip hop music and community together to address social causes. Keko is currently one of the most promising and talented rappers in Uganda. Of late Uganda has produced globally recognized MCs like Bana Mutibwa whose commonly known as Burney MC.
==== Zambia ====
The first hip hop album to be released in Zambia was actually a gospel hip hop album called &quot;Talk About God&quot; by a duo called MT God Bless which was released on cassette tape in 2003. (Mandiva Syananzu &amp; Tommy Banda were the two rappers). It got massive airplay both locally and internationally. MT God Bless were also the first Christian hip hop dual to have their music video played on South Africa&#x27;s Channel O. Pictures of the cassette tape can be seen on Mandiva&#x27;s Facebook page with the year 2003 inscribed on it. In 2005 C.R.I$..I$. Mr Swagger released what is considered the biggest debut release by a hip hop artist in Zambia titled &quot;Officer in Charge&quot;. Other notable artists to come up over the years are Black Muntu, The Holstar, Conscious, Takondwa, Pitch Black, Diamond Chain, 5ive 4our, Zone Fam, C.Q Krytic, Slap Dee, Macky 2, Mic Diggy and Urban Chaos.

<doc id="424102" wikidata="Q1248605" url="?curid=424102" title="Battle of Beachy Head (1690)">
<text>The Battle of Beachy Head, also known as the Battle of Bévéziers, was a fleet action fought on 10 July 1690 during the Nine Years&#x27; War. The battle was the most significant French naval victory over their English and Dutch opponents during the war. The Dutch lost seven ships of the line and three fire ships. Their English allies also lost one ship of the line, whereas the French did not lose a single vessel. Control of the English Channel temporarily fell into French hands but French Vice-Admiral Anne Hilarion de Tourville failed to pursue the Anglo-Dutch fleet with sufficient vigour, allowing it to fall back to the Thames.

Tourville was criticised for not following up his victory and was relieved of his command. Royal Navy Admiral Arthur Herbert, 1st Earl of Torrington, who had advised against engaging the superior French fleet but had been overruled by Queen Mary II of England and her ministers, was court-martialled for his performance during the battle. Although he was acquitted, King William III of England dismissed him from the service.

==Background==

The deposed James II of England fled to Ireland as a first step to regain the throne following his deposition after the Glorious Revolution. In August 1689, Marshal Frederick Schomberg had been sent from England to bolster the forces loyal to King William but after the Siege of Carrickfergus his army had stalled through the winter of 1689–90, suffering from sickness and desertion. As early as January 1690, it was clear to William that he would have to sail to Ireland, with substantial reinforcements, to salvage the situation.

The main Allied fleet under Admiral Herbert, Earl of Torrington, was stationed in the English Channel. A substantial part of the fleet was in the Mediterranean under Vice Admiral Henry Killigrew, which the Earl of Nottingham, William&#x27;s Secretary of State and chosen naval advisor, hoped would neutralize the French Toulon squadron. Sir Cloudesley Shovell remained in the Irish Sea but his squadron was much too small to stop the French controlling these waters if they chose to do so. The French decided not to use their fleet as a subsidiary to the Irish campaign; King Louis XIV instead directed his navy against Torrington in the Channel. Although 6,000 French troops under the command of the Comte de Lauzun were ferried across to Ireland to aid James on 17 March, the French fleet under the Comte de Tourville returned to Brest on 1 May and there remained inactive during May and June, whilst the grand fleet was assembling.

This French inaction had provided William with the opportunity he desired. On 21 June, he embarked his forces at Chester on board 280 transports, escorted by only six men-of-war commanded by Shovell. On 24 June, unmolested by the French fleet, William landed in Carrickfergus with 15,000 men for his Irish campaign, much to the consternation of James&#x27;s chief lieutenant in Ireland, the Earl of Tyrconnel, who later wrote: &quot;The want of a squadron of French men-of-war in St George&#x27;s Channel has been our ruin ... &quot;

==Prelude==

After evading Killigrew off Cadiz, the Toulon squadron (Château-Renault) joined Tourville&#x27;s fleet on 21 June. Tourville, commanding the combined Brest and Mediterranean fleets, with 75 ships of the line and 23 fire ships, sailed on 23 June into the Channel. By 30 June, the French were off the Lizard. Torrington sailed from the Nore, already convinced the French would be stronger – much of the Royal Navy had been diverted to protect their maritime commerce from privateers and the Allied fleet had only 56 English and Dutch ships of the line, with 4,153 guns, against the French fleet of 4,600 guns.

Torrington&#x27;s fleet reached the Isle of Wight and was joined by a Dutch squadron, consisting of 22 ships, under the command of Cornelis Evertsen. On 5 July, Torrington sighted the French fleet, calculating their strength at almost 80 ships of the line. Unable to proceed to the westward to link up with Shovell and Killigrew (who was on his way home), Torrington announced his intention of retreating before the superior French fleet to the Straits of Dover, believing that the risk to the fleet in being would be too great.

In William&#x27;s absence, Queen Mary and her advisors – the &#x27;Council of Nine&#x27; – hastened to take measures for the defence of the country. Carmarthen thought that it was advisable to fight, as did Nottingham and Admiral Russell, who were unconvinced that the French were as strong as Torrington reported and considered that only the admiral&#x27;s pessimism, defeatism or treachery could account for his reports. As the two fleets moved slowly up the channel (with Torrington keeping carefully out of range), Russell drafted the order to fight. Countersigned by Nottingham, the orders reached the admiral on 9 July whilst he was off Beachy Head. Torrington realised that not to give battle was to be guilty of direct disobedience and to give battle was, in his judgment, to incur serious risk of defeat. Torrington called a council of war with his flag-officers, who concluded that they had no option but to obey.

==Battle==
The following day, 10 July, off Beachy Head near Eastbourne, Torrington advanced towards the French in line of battle. He placed the Dutch white squadron with 21 ships – commanded by Cornelis Evertsen – in the van. Torrington was in the centre red squadron; the rear blue squadron, commanded by Vice-Admiral Ralph Delaval, comprised English and Dutch ships.

The French admiral divided his force of 70 ships of the line into the customary three squadrons, with white, blue, and white and blue pennants respectively. Tourville, aboard the &quot;Soleil Royal&quot;, commanded the centre, white squadron. The blue squadron in the French van was commanded by Châteaurenault; Victor-Marie d&#x27;Estrées commanded the rear white and blue squadron. In each fleet the squadron commanders were in the centre of their respective squadrons and the division flag officers in the centre of their divisions.

At about 08:00 the Allies, who had the weather gage, ran down together in line abreast, elongated in order to cover the whole French fleet and prevent doubling at either end. The Dutch squadron bore down on the leading French squadron to engage on a parallel course but left the leading division of Châteaurenault&#x27;s squadron unmarked. This division cut across Evertsen&#x27;s path and doubling on the Dutch squadron, was able to inflict much loss.

Vice Admiral Ashby of the red squadron failed to help the Dutch, as the Marquis de Villette succeeded in tacking ahead, placing Ashby between two fires. When Torrington brought the remainder of the red squadron into action, he found difficulty in getting close enough because of the sag in the French line and came no closer than twice gunshot range. Admiral Tourville, finding himself with few adversaries in the centre, pushed forward his own leading ships, which Torrington&#x27;s dispositions had left without opponents, further strengthening the French attack in the van. The Dutch were now opposed by the whole of Châteaurenault&#x27;s squadron and the van and centre divisions of Tourville&#x27;s squadron.

Delaval&#x27;s greatly outnumbered blue squadron fought a desperate battle with d&#x27;Estrées in the rear. Evertsen in the van, having lost his second-in-command and many other officers, was forced to withdraw. The Dutch had maintained the unequal contest with very little assistance from the rest of the Allied fleet; he left two Dutch fire ships sunk (&quot;Suikermolen&quot; and &quot;Kroonvogel&quot;), one shattered and dismasted vessel captured (&quot;Friesland&quot; of 68 cannon which was later burnt by the French) and many badly damaged. Outmatched, Torrington ended the battle late in the afternoon. Evertsen prevented further Dutch losses by taking advantage of the tide and the drop in wind. He ordered his ships to drop their anchors while in full sail, the French – who were not sufficiently alert – were carried off by the current and out of cannon range.

The eight-hour battle was a victory for the French but far from decisive. When the tide changed at 21:00, the Allies weighed anchor. Tourville pursued, but instead of ordering a general chase, he maintained the strict line-of-battle, reducing the speed of the fleet to that of the slower ships. Torrington burnt six more badly-damaged Dutch ships (&quot;Noorderkwartier&quot;, &quot;Gekroonde Burg&quot;, &quot;Maagd van Enkhuizen&quot;, &quot;Elswout&quot;, &quot;Tholen&quot; and the fire ship &quot;Maagd van Enkhuizen&quot;) and one English ship (the third rate 70-gun &quot;Anne&quot;) to avoid their capture before gaining the refuge of the Thames. The &quot;Wapen van Utrecht&quot; sank by herself. As soon as Torrington was in the safety of the river, he ordered all the navigation buoys removed, making any attempt to follow him too dangerous.

==Aftermath==
The defeat of Beachy Head caused panic in England. Tourville had temporary command of the English Channel. It seemed that the French could at the same time prevent William from returning from Ireland across the Irish Sea and land an invading army in England. Diarist John Evelyn wrote – &quot;The whole nation now exceedingly alarmed by the French fleet braving our coast even to the very Thames mouth&quot;, a fear compounded by news from the Continent of French victory at the Battle of Fleurus on 1 July. To oppose the threatened invasion, 6,000 regular troops, together with the hastily organised militia, were prepared by the Earl of Marlborough for the country&#x27;s defence.

In the prevailing atmosphere of panic, no-one attributed the defeat to overwhelming odds. Evertsen said that Torrington had intentionally deserted the Dutch. Nottingham accused Torrington of treachery, informing William on 13 July &quot;In plain terms ... Torrington deserted the Dutch so shamefully that the whole squadron had been lost if some of our ships had not rescued them.&quot; Nottingham was anxious to shift blame but no one disputed his interpretation. &quot;I cannot express to you&quot;, wrote William to the Grand Pensionary Anthonie Heinsius in the Dutch Republic, &quot;how distressed I am at the disasters of the fleet. I am so much the more deeply affected as I have been informed that my ships did not properly support those of the Estates, and left them in the lurch.

There was some good news for the Allies. The day after Beachy Head, 11 July, William decisively defeated Louis&#x27; ally, James II, at the Battle of the Boyne in Ireland. James fled to France but appeals to Louis for an invasion of England were not heeded. The Marquis de Seignelay, who had succeeded his father Colbert as naval minister, had not planned for an invasion and had thought no further than Beachy Head, writing to Tourville before the engagement – &quot; ... I shall be content if you will let me know as soon as possible after the battle your thoughts on the employment of the fleet for the rest of the campaign&quot;. Tourville anchored off Le Havre to refit and land his sick. The French had failed to exploit their success. To the fury of Louis and Seignelay, the sum of Tourville&#x27;s victory was the symbolic and futile burning of the English coastal town of Teignmouth in July. Tourville was relieved of command.

The English squadrons rallied to the main fleet. By the end of August the Allies had 90 vessels cruising the Channel and temporary French control had come to an end. Torrington had been sent to the Tower of London to await a court martial at Chatham. The substance of the charge was that he had withdrawn and kept back, had not done his utmost to damage the enemy and to assist his own and the Dutch ships. Torrington blamed the defeat on the lack of naval preparations and intelligence – he had not been informed that the Brest fleet had been reinforced with the Toulon squadron. He also contended that the Dutch had engaged too early, before they had reached the head of the French line. To the outrage and astonishment of William and his ministers – and the delight of the English seamen who, rightly or wrongly, regarded him as a political sacrifice to the Dutch – the court acquitted him. Torrington took up his seat in the House of Lords but William refused to see him and dismissed him from the service on 12 December (O.S). Torrington was temporarily replaced by a triumvirate of Sir Henry Killigrew, John Ashby and Sir Richard Haddock. These were in turn replaced by Admiral Russell as sole commander of the English fleet.

<doc id="424112" wikidata="Q354380" url="?curid=424112" title="KRDK-TV mast">
<text>The KRDK-TV mast is a television transmitting tower in Traill County, North Dakota, United States. At , it is currently the tallest structure in the United States, the second-tallest structure in the Western Hemisphere and the seventh-tallest structure in the world. It stands taller than the nearby KVLY-TV mast in Blanchard, North Dakota, which was previously taller until the removal of a VHF antenna reduced its height in 2019.

Located northeast of Galesburg, North Dakota, the KRDK-TV mast was completed in 1966, to replace the station&#x27;s previous mast, a tower northeast of Valley City, North Dakota (or southwest of Pillsbury) which was sold to KOVC, an AM radio station.

The KRDK-TV antenna has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 285 kW. KRDK-TV (formerly KXJB-TV) is licensed to Valley City, serving the Fargo and Grand Forks TV markets. The station and tower are owned by Major Market Broadcasting.

==Collapses==
The mast has fallen and been rebuilt twice. The first collapse occurred at 9:08a.m. on February 14, 1968, when the rotor of a Marine helicopter severed some guy-wires; all four passengers aboard the helicopter were killed in the mishap. The television station was off the air for eight days, finally resuming broadcasts from their previous (KOVC) tower. A replacement mast of the same height as the one destroyed was completed in four and a half months.

The second mast fell during an ice storm which hit the area on April 6, 1997, subjecting it to wind gusts of 70 mph and causing at least of ice to accumulate on the structure, resulting in the structure&#x27;s failure at 6:09p.m. Cable programming was resumed by 8:34 and broadcasts by 3p.m. the following afternoon through coordination with other affiliates; a temporary tower was completed and resumed broadcasts by July 10. This tower, known as KXJB-TV Mast 2, still stands next to the full-height mast.

Work began on replacement of the full-height mast with a more durably-built structure on April 1, 1998, and had reached the tower&#x27;s previous height by July 30. That day members of the construction crew affixed a four-foot (1.2 m) flagpole to the top of the tower, making the structure&#x27;s height effectively , or one foot higher than the KVLY mast (the flagpole was later removed). Broadcasting for Channel 4 was switched to the new mast on August 15.

<doc id="424114" wikidata="Q6023073" url="?curid=424114" title="Eastern Express">
<text>The Eastern Express () is an overnight passenger train operated by TCDD Taşımacılık. The train runs from Ankara to Kars. The train was the first overnight service east of Ankara. The Eastern Express stops in 7 provincial capitals: Ankara, Kırıkkale, Kayseri, Sivas, Erzincan, Erzurum and Kars. The first train ran in 1936 from Istanbul&#x27;s Haydarpaşa Terminal to Çetinkaya.

Until the Ankara–Istanbul high-speed railway project, the train ran between Istanbul and Kars.

Due to the increasing popularity of the train, TCDD Taşımacılık added a second train named the Touristic Eastern Express. This new train operates three times a week with fewer stops and costs more than the regular Eastern Express train. The Touristic Eastern Express was inaugurated in 2019 from Ankara.

==History==

During the 1930s, railway construction in Turkey reached its peak, where of lines were completed. Ever since the Turkish State Railways were formed in 1927, railways extended to eastern Turkey. A main line was to be constructed from Ankara to Erzurum, where it would connect with the broad gauge line to the Turkey/Soviet Union border built by the Russian Empire in 1916. Construction of the line started in 1924 (by the CFAB, TCDD took over in 1927) and reached Kayseri in 1927, Sivas in 1930 and Çetinkaya in 1936. The Eastern Express made its first run with the opening of the line to Çetinkaya. The railway finally reached Erzurum in 1939. In the same year the Eastern Express started operating from Haydarpaşa to Erzurum. By transferring to a broad gauge train in Erzurum, passengers could travel to Kars, the last Turkish city before the Soviet Union. In 1962, the broad gauge line from Erzurum-Kars-Akkaya was made standard gauge by the State Railways. The Eastern Express was extended to Kars in 1962.

==Equipment==
The Eastern Express had many layouts over the years. The Turkish steam locomotives were the source of power from 1936 to the 1970s when the diesel locomotive took over. The layout today is:

*DE 22 000, Head End Power Car, Coach, Coach, Coach, Diner, couchette, couchette, private cars at the end, helper engine if used

==Route==
Prior to the commencement of high-speed rail service from Istanbul to Ankara the train departed from Haydarpaşa Terminal on the Bosphorus and traveled along the south-eastern shores of Istanbul. The journey out of the extensive suburbs of the metropolis took an average of 45 minutes after which the train followed the Bay of İzmit coastline before reaching İzmit and then traveling across the Sakarya plain. At Arifye, the line headed south through the mountainous route towards Eskişehir. After crossing many gorges and after Bilecik, the train ascended the Anatolian plateau and arrived in Ankara. 

The Eastern Express runs east through Ankara&#x27;s eastern suburbs. After Kırıkkale, the train heads south-east towards Kayseri. At Kayseri the train is refuelled and has a crew change. The Eastern Express then continues east into the dusk. The route then heads north-east until Sivas, where the train has its second break. After Sivas the tracks travel through very mountainous terrain so the speed is limited. A small portion between Çetinkaya and Divriği is electrified for freight trains carrying iron ore south to the Mediterranean Sea. After Divriği the Eastern Express steadily climbs towards the Armenian Highlands. After a break in Erzurum, the train arrives in Kars in the evening.

<doc id="424117" wikidata="Q6438562" url="?curid=424117" title="Kriti (music)">
<text>A kriti () is a form musical composition in the Carnatic music literature. The Sanskrit common noun &quot;Kriti&quot; means &#x27;creation&#x27; or &#x27;work&#x27;.

A kriti forms the mental backbone of any typical Carnatic music concert and is the longer format of a Carnatic song.

==Structure==
A conventional &quot;kriti&quot; typically contain three parts:
#&quot;Pallavi&quot;, the equivalent of a refrain in Western music
#&quot;Anupallavi&quot;, the second verse, which is sometimes optional
#&quot;Charanam&quot;, the final (and longest) verse that wraps up the song

The &quot;charanam&quot; usually borrows patterns from the &quot;anupallavi&quot;. The &quot;charanam&#x27;s&quot; last line usually contains the composer&#x27;s signature, or &quot;mudra&quot;, with which the composer leaves their mark.

==Variations==
Some Kritis have a verse between the &quot;anupallavi&quot; and the &#x27;, called the &quot;&quot;. This verse consists only of notes, and has no words. Other &quot;krithis&quot;, particularly some of Oothukkadu Venkata Kavi and Muthuswami Dikshitar&#x27;s compositions, are intentionally composed without an &quot;annupallavi&quot;, where the verse after the pallavi is called the &quot;samashti charanam&quot;. Still others have some more &quot;sāhityā&quot; at the end of the &#x27;, set in &quot;madhyamakāla&quot; (few lines within a song that are sung faster than the rest of it).

There are krithi&#x27;s, such as Thyagaraja&#x27;s &quot;Enduku Nirdhaya&quot; that have no &quot;annupallavi&quot; but many short &quot;charanams&quot;. Often, the artists take up certain lines of a Krithi for &quot;neraval&quot;. One of the greatest explorers of the krti form was Oottukkadu Venkata Kavi (1700–1765), who has created numerous varieties within this form, often with innovations in contrasting speeds, gaits (&quot;gatis&quot;) and lyrical variation (&quot;sahitya-sangatis&quot;), sectional partitioning and singular blending of rhythmic syllables and lyrics.

<doc id="424122" wikidata="Q181998" url="?curid=424122" title="The Love Boat">
<text>The Love Boat is an American romantic comedy-drama television series created by Wilford Lloyd Baumes that originally aired on ABC from September 24, 1977, to May 24, 1986. In addition, three TV movies aired before the regular series premiered and four specials and a TV movie aired after the series ended. The series was set on the cruise ship MS &quot;Pacific Princess&quot;, and revolved around the ship&#x27;s captain Merrill Stubing (played by Gavin MacLeod) and a handful of his crew, with passengers played by guest actors for each episode, having romantic, dramatic and humorous adventures.

The series was part of ABC&#x27;s popular Saturday-night lineup of the time, which also included &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; until 1984. The executive producer for the series was Aaron Spelling, who produced several television series for Four Star Television and ABC from the 1960s into the 1990s.

The series was nominated four consecutive times for a Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy between 1978 and 1981, without winning any. Gavin MacLeod and Lauren Tewes also received several Golden Globe nominations for their roles in the series. In 1997, the episode with segment titles &quot;Hidden Treasure&quot;, &quot;Picture from the Past&quot;, and &quot;Ace&#x27;s Salary&quot; (season 9, episode 3) was ranked No. 82 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time list.

==Episodes==

==Cast==

* Gavin MacLeod as Your Captain, Merrill Stubing
* Bernie Kopell as Your Ship&#x27;s Doctor, Adam &quot;Doc&quot; Bricker; Kopell played a different character, Dr. O&#x27;Neill, in the second pilot film, &quot;The Love Boat II&quot;.
* Fred Grandy as Your Yeoman Purser, Burl &quot;Gopher&quot; Smith (seasons 1–6), chief purser (seasons 7–9)
* Ted Lange as Your Bartender, Isaac Washington (seasons 1–9, four specials), yeoman purser (made-for-TV movie)
* Lauren Tewes as Your Cruise Director, Julie McCoy (seasons 1–7, four specials, plus a guest appearance in season 9)
* Jill Whelan as Vicki Stubing, the captain&#x27;s daughter (guest appearance in season 2, seasons 3–9, four specials, made-for-TV movie)
* Ted McGinley as Your Ship&#x27;s Photographer, Ashley &quot;Ace&quot; Covington Evans (seasons 7–9), yeoman purser (four specials)
* Patricia Klous as Judy McCoy, Julie&#x27;s sister and successor as cruise director (seasons 8–9)

MacLeod, Kopell and Lange are the only cast members to appear in every episode of the TV series, the four specials as well as the last made-for-TV movie. Grandy appeared in every episode throughout the run of the series but he did not appear in the four specials nor in the last TV movie, as he was campaigning for the first of his four consecutive terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. MacLeod was not the captain of the &quot;Pacific Princess&quot; in the first two pilot TV movies and did not appear in them, although when his character was introduced, it was mentioned that he was the new captain; indeed, none of the series cast members appeared in the first pilot, which had a different captain and crew.

Among the series&#x27; attractions was the casting of well-known actors in guest-starring roles, with many famous film stars of prior decades making rare television appearances. &quot;The Love Boat&quot; was not the first comedy series to use the guest-star cast anthology format—&quot;Love, American Style&quot; had used the formula seven years earlier—but it had such success with the formula that future series in similar style (such as &quot;Supertrain&quot; and &quot;Masquerade&quot;) drew comparisons to &quot;The Love Boat&quot;. The series was followed on Saturday nights on ABC by &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, which was also produced by Aaron Spelling and had a similar format. In all, thirty-two past and future Academy Award winners guested on &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, including the Best Actress from the first awards ceremony in 1929, Janet Gaynor.

In the final season, a troupe of dancers who performed choreographed routines, often to current hits, was introduced. The Love Boat Mermaids were made up of Tori Brenno (Maria), Debra Johnson (Patti), Deborah Bartlett (Susie), Macarena (Sheila), Beth Myatt (Mary Beth), Andrea Moen (Starlight), Teri Hatcher (Amy) and Nanci Lynn Hammond (Jane).

==Production==

The original 1976 made-for-TV movie (titled &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, that served as the pilot for the series, was based on the nonfiction book &quot;The Love Boats&quot; by Jeraldine Saunders, a real-life cruise director for a passenger cruise-ship line. Saunders was also partly inspired by the German cruise ship MV &quot;Aurora&quot;. The pilot was followed by other two (titled &quot;The Love Boat II&quot; and &quot;The New Love Boat&quot;, all of which aired before the series began in September 1977.

The one-hour sitcom was set aboard &quot;Pacific Princess&quot;, at the time a real-life Princess Cruises cruise ship. The &quot;Pacific Princess&quot;″ twin sister vessel &quot;Island Princess&quot; was also used for the show, especially if the show&#x27;s schedule conflicted with &quot;Pacific Princess&quot;″s cruises or her annual drydocking. Based in the port of Los Angeles, the ship&#x27;s regular ports of call were Puerto Vallarta, Acapulco and Mazatlán. The series was primarily filmed on sets in southern California: 20th Century Fox Studios for seasons one through five, and the Warner Hollywood Studios for the remainder of the series, and occasionally filmed aboard the actual vessels. Regardless of where the episode was filmed, the actual ship was extensively shown in the establishing shots.

Along with use of the real-life &quot;Pacific Princess&quot; and &quot;Island Princess&quot;, the series was permitted to use some iconography owned by Princess Cruises. For example, Princess&#x27; logo is frequently visible in the establishing shots of the vessels, in the backgrounds of sets and even on props, such as name tags for the ship&#x27;s crew. However, the ownership of this fictional representation of the &quot;Pacific Princess&quot; is never explicitly stated as being Princess Cruises; instead, characters would use terms such as &quot;the line&quot; or &quot;the company&quot; in reference to the entity that owned and operated &quot;Pacific Princess&quot;.

Episodes set and filmed in European and East Asian locations became more frequent instead of the usual west coasts along the Pacific shore of North America as the show continued. They traditionally aired as season premieres or during the sweeps months of February, May and November. Ships used in these episodes were: for a Mediterranean Sea cruise, for a Chinese cruise, &quot;Royal Viking Sky&quot; for European cruises and &quot;Royal Princess&quot; and for Caribbean Sea cruises. In 1981, P&amp;O Cruises&#x27; line &quot;Sea Princess&quot; was also used for the two-hour episode &quot;Julie&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, set in and around Australia.

The &quot;star of the show&quot;, the now-world famous &quot;Pacific Princess&quot;, after being renamed MS &quot;Pacific&quot; and being sold then owned by another cruise line in Spain, was scrapped in Aliağa, Turkey in 2013 after no further buyer could be found. Her sister ship, which was later renamed , was scrapped in Alang, India in 2015 after she too failed to find a new owner. Both vessels&#x27; scrappings were controversial, but the previous owners justified it by saying that they were getting too old to continue operating.

===Writing format===
Every episode contained several storylines, each written by a different set of writers working on one group of guest stars. Thus, episodes have multiple titles referencing its simultaneous storylines, e.g., the first episode of season one is &quot;Captain &amp; the Lady / Centerfold / One If by Land&quot;.

Each episode typically featured three storylines. Storylines focused on members of the crew, the interactions between passengers and crew members, a single passenger, or interactions between several passengers. The three storylines usually followed a similar thematic pattern: One storyline (typically a &quot;crew&quot; one) was straight-ahead comedy. The second would typically follow more of a romantic comedy format (with only occasional dramatic elements). The third storyline would usually be the most dramatic of the three, often offering few (if any) laughs and a far more serious tone. A common plotline focused on a romance that had gone sour, with the parties reconciling at the end of the episode.

On rare occasions, there were crossovers between stories. In one episode, actors Robert Reed and Florence Henderson, formerly of &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;, guest-starred in separate segments. In one scene, the two bump into each other at a buffet table, exchange a questioning look, shrug, and continue on their separate ways.

===Laugh track===
The series was also distinctive as being one of the few hour-long series ever made for American television that used a laugh track.

===Theme song and title sequence===

&quot;The Love Boat&quot; theme song was composed by Charles Fox with lyrics by Paul Williams. It was sung by Jack Jones in the opening sequence of the first eight seasons and, in a different arrangement, by Dionne Warwick in the last season and the four specials that followed it. Charo, who had also recorded and commercially released the song, performed it within the show in one of her guest appearances. The opening sequence of the TV movies featured an instrumental version of the song without the lyrics. Instrumental variations of the song were extensively used throughout the series as incidental music.

The opening sequence for the series underwent three major changes over the years. From seasons one to eight, the opening sequence began with a long shot of the ship in dock before the camera slowly zoomed in onto its bridge area. This was followed by posing shots of the crew members at different points on the ship or the set, revealed with a weighing anchor graphic wipe. These posing shots were updated several times throughout all seasons due to cast changes. The long shot footage of the ship was used for the credits of the celebrity guest stars. For only the first season, the guest stars were credited by having their names appear on the screen while a radar/compass style circle with four hearts wrapped around them. Beginning with season two (and originally tested in the fifteenth episode of the first season), the compass was graphically put in place and at its center, the guest stars were shown posing for the camera on different parts of the set, the ship or on-location in special episodes, while their names appeared at the bottom of the screen. For the final season, the compass was replaced by a crescent wave and the long shot of the ship was replaced by a montage of the various locations traveled to on the series. At the center of the wave graphic, the guest stars were shown posing for the camera wearing their formal outfits against different colored backgrounds.

===Broadcast and syndication===
&quot;The Love Boat&quot; aired in reruns on ABC Daytime from June 30, 1980 to June 12, 1981, and from September 14, 1981 to June 24, 1983 at 11:00 a.m. EST/10:00 CST. The show entered the syndication market in the United States in September 1983, with Worldvision Enterprises handling distribution. As an alternative for stations with tight scheduling commitments, Worldvision offered edited 30-minute episodes in addition to the original hour-long programs beginning in the fall of 1986 after the series completed its original run on ABC. It is currently distributed in syndication by its successor CBS Media Ventures. The series can currently be seen on MeTV Sunday afternoons at 5:00 PM ET/4:00 PM CT and on Catchy Comedy Monday through Friday afternoons at 4:00 PM ET/3:00 PM CT. &quot;The Love Boat&quot; is currently airing 24/7 on its own channel on Pluto TV under the &quot;Classic TV&quot; section. So far it just seems to be the 9 regular seasons on the series.

==Home media==
CBS DVD (distributed by Paramount) has released seasons 1–4 of &quot;The Love Boat&quot; on DVD in Region 1. Each season has been released in two-volume sets.

==Reception==

For its first seven years, &quot;The Love Boat&quot; was very successful in the ratings. During that time, it usually ranked among the top 20, and sometimes even the top 10. However, the show fell out of the Top 30 during the 1984–85 season, and after falling out of the Top 50 during the 1985–86 season, &quot;The Love Boat&quot; was canceled after nine years on ABC, although four three-hour specials aired during the 1986–87 season.

===U.S. television ratings===
==Accolades==
In 1997, the episode with segment titles &quot;Hidden Treasure&quot;, &quot;Picture from the Past&quot;, and &quot;Ace&#x27;s Salary&quot; (Season 9, Episode 3) was ranked No. 82 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;&#x27;s 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time list.

In 2014, Fred Grandy, Bernie Kopell, Ted Lange, Gavin McLeod, Cynthia Lauren Tewes, and Jill Whelan became godparents (the passenger ship industry&#x27;s equivalent of naval ship sponsors) of the Princess Cruises ship &quot;Regal Princess&quot;.

On May 23, 2017, the original cast (MacLeod, Kopell, Grandy, Lange, Tewes and Whelan) reunited on &quot;Today&quot;, where it was announced they would be receiving a joint star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for their contributions to television, sponsored by Princess Cruises.

==Sequels, spin-offs and crossovers==
The 1979 two-hour season premiere of &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; —another Aaron Spelling series— that introduced Shelley Hack as new angel Tiffany Welles was titled &quot;Love Boat Angels&quot; and its characters attempted to recover stolen museum artifacts while aboard the &quot;Pacific Princess&quot; on a cruise to the Virgin Islands with all of &quot;The Love Boat&quot; regulars having cameo appearances.

A 1994 &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketch featuring guest host Patrick Stewart merged &quot;The Love Boat&quot; with &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. Stewart played the captain while caricatures of Deanna Troi and Geordi La Forge played the cruise director and bartender, with Kopell having a cameo appearance as Doc.

A two-part 1997 &quot;Martin&quot; episode, &quot;Goin&#x27; Overboard&quot;, had the main characters going on a cruise and encountering Isaac, Julie, Doc, and Vicki.

===Revival===

A revival of the series, titled &quot;Love Boat: The Next Wave,&quot; aired on UPN from 1998 to 1999 for two seasons and twenty-five episodes. Set aboard the cruise ship &quot;Sun Princess&quot;, the series starred Robert Urich as Captain Jim Kennedy, a retired United States Navy officer, Phil Morris as chief purser Will Sanders, and Heidi Mark as cruise director Nicole Jordan. Several members of the original show&#x27;s cast guest-starred on a reunion-themed episode in which it was revealed that Julie and Doc had been in love all along.

===&quot;The Real Love Boat&quot;===

In March 2022, both CBS and Australia&#x27;s Network 10 (both Paramount-owned networks) commissioned &quot;The Real Love Boat&quot;, a reality dating competition series to be produced by Eureka Productions. The series features single contestants on a luxury Mediterranean cruise as they participate in challenges and dates to stay on the boat in the hopes of finding love, with those unsuccessful being progressively dumped from the cruise. As contestants are dumped, new contestants come aboard the cruise. In the end, the last couple remaining wins the series and is awarded a large cash prize as well as a cruise from Princess Cruises.

The American version is hosted by married actors Jerry O&#x27;Connell and Rebecca Romijn. This version briefly aired on Wednesday nights at 9/8C on CBS starting on October 5, 2022, before being moved to Paramount+. The Australian version is presented by Darren McMullen. This version also premiered on 5 October 2022 and aired on Wednesdays and Thursday nights on 10.

== Influence ==
CNN reported industry experts credit the show with increasing interest in the cruise industry, especially for those that weren&#x27;t newlyweds or senior citizens, and for the resulting demand to spur investment in new ships instead of conversions. The influence was particularly notable for Princess Cruises, a line that partnered with the series and received a great deal of attention as a result.

Princess Cruises has embraced its connection to the series in its marketing. Actor Gavin Macleod was appointed the line&#x27;s global ambassador in 1986 and appeared in television advertisements and other campaigns for Princess for over 30 years. Actress Jill Whelan is currently Princess&#x27; Celebrations Ambassador and has appeared in online videos promoting the line. The series&#x27; primary cast were named the godparents for and participated in the christening of two Princess Cruises ships, the &quot;Dawn Princess&quot; in 1997 and the &quot;Regal Princess&quot; in 2014. Members of the cast have participated in themed cruises honoring the series, most recently in 2022 and 2024, with another cruise scheduled for November 2025.

<text>Sylvester Laflin &quot;Pat&quot; Weaver Jr. (December 21, 1908 – March 15, 2002) was an American broadcasting executive who was president of NBC between 1953 and 1955. He has been credited with reshaping the format and philosophy of commercial broadcasting as radio gave way to television as America&#x27;s dominant home entertainment medium. Actress Sigourney Weaver is his daughter.

==Early life and education==
Born in Los Angeles, Sylvester Laflin Weaver Jr. was the son of Eleanor Isabel (née Dixon) and Sylvester Laflin Weaver. His brother was comedian Doodles Weaver.

Weaver was of English descent and Scottish descent (possibly Clan MacFarlane), as well as of Ulster-Scots, Dutch and early New England ancestry (going back to the early days of the Massachusetts Bay Colony). He was related to Matthew Laflin, an American manufacturer of gunpowder, businessman, philanthropist, and an early pioneer of Chicago. Both were descendants of Charles Laflin, a gunpowder manufacturer, who came to America in 1740 from Ulster, Ireland, settling in Oxford, Massachusetts. Charles Laflin and his family were living at Oxford when he purchased land in 1749 in Westfield, Massachusetts.
Weaver graduated from Dartmouth College in 1930, where he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and Phi Kappa Psi fraternity.

He served in the United States Navy during World War II from 1942 to 1945.

==Career==
Weaver worked for the Young &amp; Rubicam advertising agency and American Tobacco during the golden age of radio.&lt;ref name=&quot;jimramsburg/1951-52&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1930s he produced Fred Allen&#x27;s &quot;Town Hall Tonight&quot; radio show, and he then supervised all the agency&#x27;s radio programming. NBC hired him in 1949 to challenge CBS&#x27;s programming lead. At NBC, Weaver established many operating practices that became standard for network television. He introduced the practice of networks producing their own television programming, then selling advertising time during the broadcasts. Prior to that, ad agencies usually created each show for a particular client. Because commercial announcements could now more easily be sold to more than one company sponsor for each program, a single advertiser pulling out would not necessarily threaten a program.

Weaver created &quot;Today&quot; in 1952, followed by &quot;Tonight Starring Steve Allen&quot; (1954), &quot;Home&quot; (1954) with Arlene Francis and &quot;Wide Wide World&quot; (1955), hosted by Dave Garroway. There are those who dispute Weaver&#x27;s credit for &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, including hosts Steve Allen and Jack Paar but, during a broadcast of &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, both the host and his guest Dick Cavett stated that Weaver created both &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. Years later, Paar said &quot;He didn&#x27;t invent programs, but wrote great memos.&quot;

He believed that broadcasting should educate as well as entertain. He required NBC shows to include at least one sophisticated cultural reference or performance per installment — including a segment of a Verdi opera adapted to the comic style of Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca&#x27;s groundbreaking &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot;. Weaver did not ignore NBC Radio, either. In 1955, as network radio was dying, Weaver helped revive it with &quot;NBC Monitor&quot;, a weekend-long magazine-style programming block that featured an array of news, music, comedy, drama, sports, and anything that could be broadcast within magazine style, with rotating advertisers and some of the most memorable names in broadcast journalism, entertainment and sports.

He was the developer of the magazine style of advertising whereby sponsors would purchase blocks of time (typically one to two minutes) in a show, rather than sponsor an entire show. This style suited the networks. Like a magazine, a television network could now control what advertisements were being broadcast and no one advertiser could own exclusive rights to a particular show.

Advertisers and network executives agreed that radio audiences preferred live broadcasts to prerecorded shows. Weaver believed that ratings for radio had declined because listeners were tired of predictable, regularly scheduled shows. For NBC he advocated for television spectaculars, live, 90-minute special programs with high production values and costs. While some, like &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, were very successful, CBS&#x27;s more traditional programming of regularly scheduled and prefilmed shows like &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; were more popular, less expensive, and could be rerun. NBC fired Weaver in August 1956; he never worked for another network.

&quot;NBC Monitor&quot; long outlived Weaver&#x27;s tenure running the network. His successors (first, David Sarnoff&#x27;s son, Robert; then, Robert Kintner) standardized the network&#x27;s programming practices. In November 1960, years after leaving NBC, Weaver displayed his frustration with the network in an article in the Sunday edition of &quot;The Denver Post&quot;. What once was the Golden Age of Television in the early 1950s slowly diminished by the end of the decade into the early 1960s, when he claimed networks made a series of bad decisions. In the article he noted management problems within NBC, CBS, and ABC: &quot;Television has gone from about a dozen forms to just two – news shows and the Hollywood stories. The blame lies in the management of NBC, CBS and ABC. Management doesn&#x27;t give the people what they deserve. I don&#x27;t see any hope in the system as it is.&quot;

Weaver proposed on at least two occasions a fourth television network (dubbed the &quot;Pat Weaver Prime Time Network&quot;) that never came to fruition. He also lent his talents as a consultant for radio and television activities to Freedomland U.S.A., a New York City theme park, during its 1960 debut. He is featured in the book &quot;Freedomland U.S.A.: The Definitive History&quot; (Theme Park Press, 2019).

In 1985, Pat Weaver was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.

==Personal life and death==
Weaver married Elizabeth Inglis in 1942. She was born Desiree Mary Lucy Hawkins (daughter of Alan G. Hawkins and Margaret I. Hunt) on July 10, 1913, in Colchester, Essex, England; and died on August 25, 2007, in Santa Barbara, California. She made her screen debut in &quot;Borrowed Clothes&quot; (1934) as well as a number of small parts in some of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s early movies. She reached the high point of her career when she co-starred with Bette Davis in William Wyler&#x27;s movie &quot;The Letter&quot;. She retired from acting when she married in 1942. The couple had two children, Trajan Victor Charles Weaver and actress Sigourney Weaver (born Susan Alexandra Weaver).

Pat Weaver died in 2002 of natural causes at his home in Santa Barbara at age 93.

== History ==
Hakodate airport opened in 1961 with a single, 1,200-meter runway. A new terminal upgrade and runway extension to 2,000 m became operational in 1971. The runway was extended further to 2,500 m in 1978 and to 3,000 m in 1999. A new terminal building opened in 2005.

On September 6, 1976, Soviet pilot Viktor Belenko defected to the West by landing a MiG-25 Foxbat aircraft at Hakodate Airport.

On June 21, 1995, All Nippon Airways Flight 857, a scheduled Boeing 747 flight from Tokyo to Hakodate, was hijacked by Fumio Kutsumi, a Tokyo bank employee armed with a screwdriver. Kutsumi claimed to be acting on behalf of Aum Shinrikyo cult group leader Shoko Asahara. The aircraft landed in Hakodate and stayed on the runway overnight for 15 hours before riot police stormed the aircraft at dawn and freed the passengers.

<doc id="424141" wikidata="Q3184725" url="?curid=424141" title="Compassionate conservatism">
<text>Compassionate conservatism is an American political philosophy that stresses using conservative techniques and concepts in order to improve the general welfare of society. The philosophy supports the implementation of policies designed to help the disadvantaged and alleviate poverty through the free market, envisaging a triangular relationship between government, charities and faith-based organizations. The term entered mainstream parlance between 2001 and 2009, during the administration of US President George W. Bush. He used the term often to describe his personal views and embody some parts of his administration&#x27;s agenda and policy approach. 

The term itself is often credited to the American historian and politician Doug Wead, who used it as the title of a speech in 1979. Although its origins lie mostly in accepted economic principles, some applications of it have been criticized as paternalism. The term has been used in the United Kingdom by former Prime Minister David Cameron, in New Zealand by former Prime Minister John Key, and in Lithuania by President Gitanas Nausėda.

The term &quot;compassionate conservatism&quot; has also been applied to Christian democratic political parties. However, Christian democrats are far more supportive of government interventionism in the economy.

==Origins of the term==
Historian and presidential advisor Doug Wead may have been the first person to use the phrase &quot;compassionate conservative&quot;. In 1977, Wead wrote a book about Kolkata, India, entitled &quot;The Compassionate Touch&quot;. In 1979, he gave a popular speech entitled &quot;The Compassionate Conservative&quot; at the annual Washington Charity Dinner. Tapes of the speech were sold across the country at corporate seminars.

Wead contended that the policies of Republican conservatives should be motivated by compassion, not protecting the status quo. He declared himself to be &quot;a bleeding heart conservative,&quot; meaning that he cared for people and sincerely believed that a free marketplace was better for the poor.

In 1981, in a perhaps-unrelated usage, Vernon Jordan of the National Urban League said of the Reagan administration,

In 1982, Wead co-authored with Ronald Reagan&#x27;s Secretary of the Interior, James G. Watt, the book &quot;The Courage of a Conservative&quot; and developed his ideas further in chapter five of the book, which was entitled &quot;The Compassionate Conservative.&quot;

In 1984, U.S. Representative James R. Jones (D-OK) told &quot;The New York Times&quot;:

Earlier the same year Republican Ray Shamie proclaimed that &quot;I believe in a visionary and compassionate conservatism&quot;

In June 1986, Wead wrote an article for the &quot;Christian Herald&quot;, describing then-vice-president George H. W. Bush, to whom he served as an aide, as a &quot;compassionate conservative.&quot;

According to journalist Jacob Weisberg, George W. Bush, George H. W. Bush&#x27;s son, first picked up the term &quot;compassionate conservative&quot; from Wead, in 1987.

In 1992, when Doug Wead ran for U.S. Representative from Arizona, he wrote a campaign book entitled &quot;Time for a Change&quot;. The first chapter was called &quot;The Compassionate Conservative&quot; and outlined Wead&#x27;s philosophy that the masses did not care if Republican policies worked if the attitude and purpose behind the policies were uncaring.

Some insist the doctrine was invented by Marvin Olasky, who went on to memorialize it in his books &quot;Renewing American Compassion&quot; (1996) and &quot;Compassionate Conservatism: What it is, What it Does, and How it Can Transform America&quot; (2000), and Myron Magnet of the Manhattan Institute. Olasky has been called the &quot;godfather of compassionate conservatism&quot;.

The phrase was popularized when George W. Bush adopted it as one of his key slogans during his 2000 presidential campaign against Al Gore. Bush also wrote the foreword to Olasky&#x27;s &quot;Compassionate Conservatism&quot;. Olasky said others had come up with the term first.

==As a political descriptor==

===Use in the 1990s===
Compassionate conservatism has been defined as the belief that conservatism and compassion complement each other. A compassionate conservative might see the social problems of the United States, such as health care or immigration, as issues that are better solved through cooperation with private companies, charities, and religious institutions rather than directly through government departments. As former Bush chief speechwriter Michael Gerson put it, &quot;Compassionate conservatism is the theory that the government should encourage the effective provision of social services without providing the service itself.&quot;

Magnet and Olasky said 19th century compassionate conservatism was based in part on the Christian doctrine of original sin, which held that &quot;Man is sinful and likely to want something for nothing. … Man&#x27;s sinful nature leads to indolence.&quot;

In the words of Magnet,

Compassionate conservative philosophy argues for policies in support of traditional families, welfare reform to promote individual responsibility (cf. workfare), active policing, standards-based schools (cf. No Child Left Behind Act), and assistance (economic or otherwise) to poor countries around the world.

U.S. president George W. Bush said:

Bush began his presidency hoping to make compassionate conservatism his centerpiece. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, he focused less on this theme, but, according to professor and author Ira Chernus, its fundamental ideas became central in his rhetoric about the War on Terrorism.

===Reception and criticism===
Nicholas Lemann, writing in &quot;New Yorker&quot; magazine in 2015, wrote that George W. Bush&#x27;s &quot;description of himself, in the 2000 campaign, as a &#x27;compassionate conservative&#x27; was brilliantly vague—liberals heard it as &#x27;I&#x27;m not all that conservative,&#x27; and conservatives heard it as &#x27;I&#x27;m deeply religious.&#x27; It was about him as a person, not a program.&quot;

In a July 1999 speech to the Democratic Leadership Council, then-President Bill Clinton criticized Bush&#x27;s &quot;compassionate conservative&quot; self-description, saying: &quot;This &#x27;compassionate conservatism&#x27; has a great ring to it, you know? It sounds so good. And I&#x27;ve really worked hard to try to figure out what it means... I made an honest effort, and near as I can tell, here&#x27;s what it means: It means, &#x27;I like you. I do. And I would like to be for the patients&#x27; bill of rights and I&#x27;d like to be for closing the gun show loophole, and I&#x27;d like not to squander the surplus and, you know, save Social Security and Medicare for the next generation. I&#x27;d like to raise the minimum wage. I&#x27;d like to do these things. But I just can&#x27;t, and I feel terrible about it. Similarly, in December 2005, then-British Prime Minister Tony Blair, speaking in the House of Commons, said: &quot;the only difference between compassionate conservatism and conservatism is that under compassionate conservatism they tell you they&#x27;re not going to help you but they&#x27;re really sorry about it.&quot;

Some critics of George W. Bush criticized the phrase &quot;compassionate conservatism&quot; as simply sugarcoating, an empty phrase to make traditional conservatism sound more appealing to moderate voters. Liberal commentator Joe Conason, noting Bush&#x27;s policy of tax cuts, wrote in 2003 that &quot;so far, being a &#x27;compassionate conservative&#x27; appears to mean nothing very different from being a hardhearted, stingy, old-fashioned conservative.&quot; 
Others on the left have viewed it as an effort to remove America&#x27;s social safety net out of the hands of the government and give it to Christian churches. &quot;Liberals make a big mistake if they dismiss &#x27;compassionate conservatism&#x27; as just a hypocritical catch phrase&quot;, wrote University of Colorado religion professor Ira Chernus. &quot;For the right, it is a serious scheme to give tax dollars to churches through so-called &#x27;faith-based initiatives. Nobel Prize–winning Keynesian economist and columnist Paul Krugman has called it a &quot;dog whistle&quot; to the religious right, referencing Marvin Olasky&#x27;s &quot;The Tragedy of American Compassion,&quot; who believed the poor must help themselves and that poverty was the fault not of society but of the poor and of social workers. Krugman endorses Digby&#x27;s analysis that right-wing compassionate &#x27;charity&#x27; assumes that the giver has the right to investigate and dictate the life of the receiver, even for the smallest charity.

Conversely, the phrase has also been attacked from the right. John J. DiIulio, Jr. wrote that Bush&#x27;s &quot;Duty of Hope&quot; speech, delivered in Indianapolis in May 1999, drew a &quot;negative reaction from his party&#x27;s right wings. ... Many Republican conservative activists hated the center-hugging &#x27;compassionate conservative.&#x27; Others favored it, but only as a rhetorical Trojan Horse. If a &#x27;compassionate conservative&#x27; was actually a government-shrinking libertarian in religious drag, then fine. But, if Bush really meant what he said, Gore-like, about volunteerism not being enough ... or about rejecting as &#x27;destructive&#x27; the Reagan-tested idea that government itself is the main problem, then many conservative Republicans would not suffer it.&quot; Herman Cain criticized the idea of &quot;compassionate conservatism&quot; as leading to the Bush administration&#x27;s increased government spending, saying that it &quot;completely betrayed conservative voters and their decades of grassroots activism&quot;, and &quot;alienated the party&#x27;s conservative base&quot;, noting Bush policies such as the Medicare prescription-drug benefit, which increased the size of the Medicare program by around $500 billion.

In 2006, conservative commentator Jonah Goldberg has written that compassionate conservatism as implemented by George W. Bush differs markedly from the theoretical concept: &quot;As countless writers have noted in &quot;National Review&quot; over the last five years, most conservatives never really understood what compassionate conservatism was, beyond a convenient marketing slogan to attract swing voters. The reality—as even some members of the Bush team will sheepishly concede—is that there was nothing behind the curtain.&quot; Similarly, conservative commentator Fred Barnes wrote: &quot;Bush has famously defined himself as a compassionate conservative with a positive agenda. Almost by definition, this makes him a big government conservative.&quot;

===Decline===
The phrase and the idea of compassionate conservativism declined after the Bush administration left office. In December 2011, Christian commentator Jim Wallis of Sojourners, citing harsh rhetoric toward the poor and immigrants from candidates for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, wrote that &quot;the compassionate conservative agenda has virtually disappeared from the Republican Party.&quot; In January 2012, commentator Amy Sullivan wrote that &quot;Just three years after George W. Bush left the White House, compassionate conservatives are an endangered species. In the new Tea Party era, they&#x27;ve all but disappeared from Congress, and their philosophy is reviled within the GOP as big-government conservatism.&quot; Sullivan noted that Republican presidential candidates &quot;have jostled to take the hardest line in opposing government-funded programs to help the poor.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; columnist Eugene Robinson made similar observations.

==Other uses==
===United Kingdom=== 

According to a 2006 report by the British think tank Policy Exchange, &quot;compassionate conservative&quot; was &quot;one of the most prominent themes&quot; of the Conservative Party under David Cameron. In speeches and the party&#x27;s statement of aims and values around 2005 and 2006, Cameron and other senior Conservatives emphasized a &quot;modern, compassionate conservatism&quot; theme. Other figures associated with compassionate conservatism in Britain include Tim Montgomerie and Iain Duncan Smith. At the 2011 Conservative Party Conference, the party released a pamphlet titled &quot;Modern Compassionate Conservatism&quot;, which senior leaders such as Cameron and foreign secretary William Hague claimed had pushed for &quot;compassionate&quot; and &quot;cuddly&quot; policies. In 2015, Michael Gove claimed David Cameron was &quot;a modern, compassionate Conservative.&quot; The term &quot;compassionate conservative&quot; was used as a way for the Conservatives to distance themselves from their &quot;Nasty Party&quot; image. This is exemplified by some think tanks, such as Bright Blue and the Centre for Social Justice.

===Christian democracy===

Political commentator Jane Louise Kandur has used the term &quot;compassionate conservatism&quot; to describe Christian democratic political parties, with their support of labour unions and church-established schools and hospitals. While Christian democrats uphold social conservatism, they advocate for human rights and social justice, being in support of the welfare state. However, unlike the American philosophy, they are far more supportive of government intervention in the economy.

<doc id="424150" wikidata="Q370706" url="?curid=424150" title="Iranian Embassy siege">
<text>The Iranian Embassy siege took place from 30 April to 5 May 1980, after a group of six armed men stormed the Iranian embassy on Prince&#x27;s Gate in South Kensington, London. 

The gunmen, Iranian Arabs campaigning for sovereignty of Khuzestan Province, took 26 people hostage, including embassy staff, several visitors, and a police officer who had been guarding the embassy. They demanded the release of prisoners in Khuzestan and their own safe passage out of the United Kingdom. The British government quickly decided that safe passage would not be granted and a siege ensued. Subsequently, police negotiators secured the release of five hostages in exchange for minor concessions, such as the broadcasting of the hostage-takers&#x27; demands on British television.

By the sixth day of the siege the gunmen were increasingly frustrated at the lack of progress in meeting their demands. That evening, they killed a hostage and threw his body out of the embassy. The British Special Air Service (SAS) initiated &quot;Operation Nimrod&quot; to rescue the remaining hostages, abseiling from the roof and forcing entry through the windows. During the 17-minute raid they rescued all but one of the remaining hostages and killed five of the six hostage-takers. An inquest cleared the SAS of any wrongdoing. The sole remaining gunman served 27 years in prison in Britain.

The operation brought the SAS to the public eye for the first time and bolstered the reputation of Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government. The SAS was quickly overwhelmed by the number of applications it received from people inspired by the operation and experienced greater demand for its expertise from foreign governments. The embassy building, damaged by a fire which started during the assault, was not reopened until 1993. 

The SAS raid, televised live on a bank holiday evening, became a defining moment in British history and proved a career boost for several journalists; it became the subject of multiple documentaries and works of fiction, including several films, television series and video games.

==Background==
===Motives===

The hostage-takers were members of the Democratic Revolutionary Front for the Liberation of Arabistan (DRFLA), Iranian Arabs protesting for the establishment of an autonomous Arab state in the southern region of the Iranian province of Khūzestān which is home to an Arabic-speaking minority. The oil-rich area had become the source of much of Iran&#x27;s wealth, having been developed by multi-national companies during the reign of the Shah.

According to Oan Ali Mohammed, suppression of the Arab sovereignty movement was the spark that led to his desire to attack the Iranian Embassy in London. The plan was inspired by the Iran hostage crisis in which supporters of the revolution held the staff of the American Embassy in Tehran hostage.

===Arrival in London===

Using Iraqi passports, Oan and three other members of the DRFLA arrived in London on 31 March 1980 and rented a flat in Earl&#x27;s Court, West London. They claimed they had met by chance on the flight. Over the following days, the group swelled, with up to a dozen men in the flat on one occasion.

Oan was 27 and from Khūzestān; he had studied at the University of Tehran, where he became politically active. He had been imprisoned by SAVAK, the Shah&#x27;s secret police, and bore scars which he said were from torture in SAVAK custody. The other members of his group were Shakir Abdullah Radhil, known as &quot;Faisal&quot;, Oan&#x27;s second-in-command who also claimed to have been tortured by SAVAK; Shakir Sultan Said, or &quot;Hassan&quot;; Themir Moammed Hussein, or Abbas; Fowzi Badavi Nejad, or &quot;Ali&quot;; and Makki Hanoun Ali, the youngest of the group, who went by the name of &quot;Makki&quot;.

On 30 April the men informed their landlord that they were going to Bristol for a week and then returning to Iraq, stated that they would no longer require the flat, and arranged for their belongings to be sent to Iraq. They left the building at 09:30 (BST) on 30 April. Their initial destination is unknown, but en route to the Iranian Embassy they collected firearms (including pistols and submachine guns), ammunition and hand grenades. The weapons, predominantly Soviet-made, are believed to have been smuggled into the United Kingdom in a diplomatic bag belonging to Iraq. Shortly before 11:30, and almost two hours after vacating the nearby flat in Lexham Gardens in South Kensington, the six men arrived outside the embassy.

According to a 2014 academic study into the Iran–Iraq War (which broke out later in 1980), the attackers were &quot;recruited and trained&quot; by the Iraqi government as part of a campaign of subversion against Iran, which included sponsorship of several separatist movements.

===Special Air Service===
The Special Air Service (SAS) is a regiment of the British Army and part of the United Kingdom&#x27;s special forces, originally formed in the Second World War to conduct irregular warfare. Western European governments were prompted to form specialist police and military counter-terrorist units following the Munich massacre at the 1972 Olympic Games, during which a police operation to end a hostage crisis ended in chaos. In the resulting firefight, a police officer, most of the hostage-takers, and all of the hostages were killed. In response, West Germany created GSG 9, which was quickly followed by the French GIGN. 

Following these examples, the British government, worried that the country was unprepared for a similar crisis in the United Kingdom, ordered the formation of the Counter Revolutionary Warfare (CRW) Wing of the SAS. This became the UK&#x27;s primary anti-terrorist and anti-hijacking unit. The SAS had taken part in counter-insurgency operations abroad since 1945, and had trained the bodyguards of influential people whose deaths would be contrary to British interests. Thus, it was believed to be better prepared for the role than any unit in the police or elsewhere in the armed forces. The CRW Wing&#x27;s first operational experience was the storming of Lufthansa Flight 181 in 1977, when a small detachment of soldiers were sent to assist GSG 9, the elite West German police unit set up after the events of 1972.

==Siege==
===Day one: 30 April===
At approximately 11:30 on Wednesday 30 April the six heavily armed members of DRFLA stormed the Iranian Embassy building on Prince&#x27;s Gate, South Kensington. The gunmen quickly overpowered Police Constable Trevor Lock of the Metropolitan Police&#x27;s Diplomatic Protection Group (DPG). Lock was carrying a concealed Smith &amp; Wesson .38-calibre revolver, but was unable to draw it before he was overpowered, although he did manage to press the &quot;panic button&quot; on his radio. Lock was later frisked, but the gunman conducting the search did not find the constable&#x27;s weapon. He remained in possession of the revolver, and to keep it concealed he refused to remove his coat, which he told the gunmen was to &quot;preserve his image&quot; as a police officer. The officer also refused offers of food throughout the siege for fear that the weapon would be seen if he had to use the toilet and a gunman decided to escort him.

Although the majority of the people in the embassy were captured, three managed to escape—two by climbing out of a ground-floor window and the third by climbing across a first-floor parapet to the Ethiopian Embassy next door. A fourth person, Gholam-Ali Afrouz, the chargé d&#x27;affaires and thus most senior Iranian official present, briefly escaped by jumping out of a first-floor window, but was injured in the process and quickly captured. Afrouz and the 25 other hostages were all taken to a room on the second floor. The majority of the hostages were embassy staff, predominantly Iranian nationals, but several British employees were also captured. The other hostages were all visitors, with the exception of Lock, the British police officer guarding the embassy. Afrouz had been appointed to the position less than a year before, his predecessor having been dismissed after the revolution. Abbas Fallahi, who had been a butler before the revolution, was appointed the doorman by Afrouz. One of the British members of staff was Ron Morris, from Battersea, who had worked for the embassy in various positions since 1947.

During the course of the siege, police and journalists established the identities of several other hostages. Mustapha Karkouti was a journalist covering the crisis at the US Embassy in Tehran and was at the embassy for an interview with Abdul Fazi Ezzati, the cultural attaché. Muhammad Hashir Faruqi was another journalist, at the embassy to interview Afrouz for an article on the Iranian Revolution. Simeon &quot;Sim&quot; Harris and Chris Cramer, both employees of the BBC, were at the embassy attempting to obtain visas to visit Iran, hoping to cover the aftermath of the 1979 revolution, after several unsuccessful attempts. They found themselves sitting next to Moutaba Mehrnavard, who was there to consult Ahmad Dadgar, the embassy&#x27;s medical adviser, and Ali Asghar Tabatabai, who was collecting a map for use in a presentation he had been asked to give at the end of a course he had been attending.
Police arrived at the embassy almost immediately after the first reports of gunfire, and, within ten minutes, seven DPG officers were on the scene. The officers moved to surround the embassy, but retreated when a gunman appeared at a window and threatened to open fire. Deputy Assistant Commissioner John Dellow arrived nearly 30 minutes later and took command of the operation. Dellow established a temporary headquarters in his car before moving it to the Royal School of Needlework further down Prince&#x27;s Gate and then to 24 Prince&#x27;s Gate, a nursery school. From his various command posts, Dellow coordinated the police response, including the deployment of D11, the Metropolitan Police&#x27;s marksmen, and officers with specialist surveillance equipment. Police negotiators, led by Max Vernon, made contact with Oan via a field telephone passed through one of the embassy windows, and were assisted by a negotiator and a psychiatrist. At 15:15 Oan issued the DRFLA&#x27;s first demand, the release of 91 Arabs held in prisons in Khūzestān, and threatened to blow up the embassy and the hostages if this were not done by noon on 1 May.

Large numbers of journalists were on the scene quickly and were moved into a holding area to the west of the front of the embassy, while dozens of Iranian protesters also arrived near the embassy and remained there throughout the siege. A separate police command post was established to contain the protests, which descended into violent confrontations with the police on several occasions. Shortly after the beginning of the crisis, the British government&#x27;s emergency committee COBRA was assembled. COBRA is made up of ministers, civil servants and expert advisers, including representatives from the police and the armed forces. The meeting was chaired by William Whitelaw, the Home Secretary, as Margaret Thatcher, the Prime Minister, was unavailable. 

The Iranian government accused the British and American governments of sponsoring the attack as revenge for the ongoing siege of the US Embassy in Tehran. Given the lack of co-operation from Iran, Thatcher, kept apprised of the situation by Whitelaw, determined that British law would be applied to the embassy. At 16:30, the gunmen released their first hostage, Frieda Mozaffarian. She had been unwell since the siege began, and Oan had asked for a doctor to be sent into the embassy to treat her, but the police refused. The other hostages deceived Oan into believing that Mozaffarian was pregnant, and Oan eventually released Mozaffarian after her condition deteriorated.

===Day two: 1 May===
The COBRA meetings continued through the night and into Thursday. Meanwhile, two teams were dispatched from the headquarters of the Special Air Service (SAS) near Hereford, and arrived at a holding area in Regent&#x27;s Park Barracks. The teams, from B Squadron, complemented by specialists from other squadrons, were equipped with CS gas, stun grenades, and explosives and armed with Browning Hi-Power pistols and Heckler &amp; Koch MP5 submachine guns. Lieutenant-Colonel Michael Rose, commander of 22 SAS, had travelled ahead of the detachment and introduced himself to Dellow, the commander of the police operation. At approximately 03:30 on 1 May, one of the SAS teams moved into the building next door to the embassy, normally occupied by the Royal College of General Practitioners, where they were briefed on Rose&#x27;s &quot;immediate action&quot; plan, to be implemented should the SAS be required to storm the building before a more sophisticated plan could be formed.

Early in the morning of 1 May, the gunmen ordered one of the hostages to telephone the BBC&#x27;s news desk. During the call, Oan took the receiver and spoke directly to the BBC journalist. He identified the group to which the gunmen belonged and stated that the non-Iranian hostages would not be harmed, but refused to allow the journalist to speak to any other hostages. At some point during the day, the police disabled the embassy&#x27;s telephone lines, leaving the hostage-takers just the field telephone for outside communication. As the hostages woke up, Chris Cramer, a sound organiser for the BBC, appeared to become seriously ill. He and three other non-Arab hostages had decided one of them must get out, and to do this, he had convincingly exaggerated the symptoms of an existing illness. His colleague, Sim Harris, was taken to the field telephone to negotiate for a doctor. The police negotiator refused the request, instead telling Harris to persuade Oan to release Cramer. The ensuing negotiations between Harris, Oan, and the police took up most of the morning, and Cramer was eventually released at 11:15. He was rushed to hospital in an ambulance, accompanied by police officers sent to gather information from him.

As the deadline of noon approached, set the previous day for the release of the Arab prisoners, the police became convinced that the gunmen did not have the capability to carry out their threat of blowing up the embassy, and persuaded Oan to agree to a new deadline of 14:00. The police allowed the deadline to pass, to no immediate response from the gunmen. During the afternoon, Oan altered his demands, requesting that the British media broadcast a statement of the group&#x27;s grievances and for ambassadors of three Arab countries to negotiate the group&#x27;s safe passage out of the UK once the statement had been broadcast.

At approximately 20:00, Oan became agitated by noises coming from the Ethiopian Embassy next door. The noise came from technicians who were drilling holes in the wall to implant listening devices, but PC Trevor Lock, when asked to identify the sound, attributed it to mice. COBRA decided to create ambient noise to cover the sound created by the technicians and instructed British Gas to commence drilling in an adjacent road, supposedly to repair a gas main. The drilling was aborted after it agitated the gunmen, and instead British Airports Authority, owner of London Heathrow Airport, was told to instruct approaching aircraft to fly over the embassy at low altitude.

===Day three: 2 May===
At 09:30 on 2 May, Oan appeared at the first-floor window of the embassy to demand access to the telex system, which the police had disabled along with the telephone lines, and threatened to kill Abdul Fazi Ezzati, the cultural attaché. The police refused and Oan pushed Ezzati, who he had been holding at gunpoint at the window, across the room, before demanding to speak to somebody from the BBC who knew Sim Harris. The police, relieved to have a demand to which they could easily agree, produced Tony Crabb, managing director of BBC Television News and Harris&#x27;s boss. Oan shouted his demands—for safe passage out of the UK, to be negotiated by three ambassadors from Arab countries—to Crabb from the first-floor window, and instructed that they should be broadcast along with a statement of the hostage-takers&#x27; aims by the BBC. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office informally approached the embassies of Algeria, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Syria and Qatar to ask if their ambassadors would be willing to talk to the hostage-takers. The Jordanian ambassador immediately refused and the other five said they would consult their governments. The BBC broadcast the statement that evening, but in a form unsatisfactory to Oan, who considered it to be truncated and incorrect.

Meanwhile, the police located the embassy caretaker and took him to their forward headquarters to brief the SAS and senior police officers. He informed them that the embassy&#x27;s front door was reinforced by a steel security door, and that the windows on the ground floor and first floor were fitted with armoured glass, the result of recommendations made after the SAS had been asked to review security arrangements for the embassy several years earlier. Plans for entering the embassy by battering the front door and ground-floor windows were quickly scrapped and work began on other ideas.

===Day four: 3 May===
Oan, angered by the BBC&#x27;s incorrect reporting of his demands the previous evening, contacted the police negotiators shortly after 06:00 and accused the authorities of deceiving him. He demanded to speak with an Arab ambassador, but the negotiator on duty claimed that talks were still being arranged by the Foreign Office. Recognising the delaying tactic, Oan told the negotiator that the British hostages would be the last to be released because of the British authorities&#x27; deceit. He added that a hostage would be killed unless Tony Crabb was brought back to the embassy. Crabb did not arrive at the embassy until 15:30, nearly ten hours after Oan demanded his presence, to the frustration of both Oan and Sim Harris. Oan then relayed another statement to Crabb via Mustapha Karkouti, a journalist also being held hostage in the embassy. The police guaranteed that the statement would be broadcast on the BBC&#x27;s next news bulletin, in exchange for the release of two hostages. The hostages decided amongst themselves that the two to be released would be Hiyech Kanji and Ali-Guil Ghanzafar; the former as she was pregnant and the latter for no other reason than his loud snoring, which kept the other hostages awake at night and irritated the terrorists.

Later in the evening, at approximately 23:00, an SAS team reconnoitred the roof of the embassy. They discovered a skylight, and succeeded in unlocking it for potential use as an access point, should they later be required to storm the building. They also attached ropes to the chimneys to allow soldiers to abseil down the building and gain access through the windows if necessary.

===Day five: 4 May===
During the day, the Foreign Office held further talks with diplomats from Arabian countries in the hope of persuading them to go to the embassy and talk to the hostage-takers. The talks, hosted by Douglas Hurd, ended in stalemate. The diplomats insisted they must be able to offer safe passage out of the UK for the gunmen, believing this to be the only way to guarantee a peaceful outcome, but the British government was adamant that safe passage would not be considered under any circumstances. Karkouti, through whom Oan had issued his revised demands the previous day, became increasingly ill throughout the day and by the evening was feverish, which led to suggestions that the police had spiked the food that had been sent into the embassy. John Dellow, the commander of the police operation, had apparently considered the idea and even consulted a doctor about its viability, but eventually dismissed it as &quot;impracticable&quot;.

The SAS officers involved in the operation, including Brigadier Peter de la Billière, Director SAS, Rose, and Major Hector Gullan (commander of the team that would undertake any raid) spent the day refining their plans for an assault.

===Day six: 5 May===
Oan woke Lock at dawn, convinced that an intruder was in the embassy. Lock was sent to investigate, but no intruder was found. Later in the morning, Oan called Lock to examine a bulge in the wall separating the Iranian embassy from the Ethiopian embassy next door. The bulge had, in fact, been caused by the removal of bricks to allow an assault team to break through the wall and to implant listening devices, resulting in a weakening of the wall. Although Lock assured him that he did not believe the police were about to storm the building, Oan remained convinced that they were &quot;up to something&quot; and moved the male hostages from the room in which they had spent the last four days to another down the hall. Tensions rose throughout the morning and, at 13:00, Oan told the police that he would kill a hostage unless he was able to speak to an Arab ambassador within 45 minutes. At 13:40, Lock informed the negotiator that the gunmen had taken Abbas Lavasani, the embassy&#x27;s chief press officer, downstairs and were preparing to execute him. Lavasani, a strong supporter of the 1979 Iranian Revolution, had repeatedly provoked his captors during the siege. According to Lock, Lavasani stated that &quot;if they were going to kill a hostage, [Lavasani] wanted it to be him.&quot; At exactly 13:45, 45 minutes after Oan&#x27;s demand to speak to an ambassador, three shots were heard from inside the embassy.

Whitelaw, who had been chairing the COBRA crisis meeting during the siege, was rushed back to Whitehall from a function he had been attending in Slough, roughly away, arriving 19 minutes after the shots had been reported. He was briefed on the SAS plan by de la Billière, who told him to expect that up to 40 percent of the hostages would be killed in an assault. After deliberations, Whitelaw instructed the SAS to prepare to assault the building at short notice, an order that was received by Lieutenant-Colonel Rose at 15:50. By 17:00, the SAS were in a position to assault the embassy at ten minutes&#x27; notice. The police negotiators recruited the imam from Regent&#x27;s Park Mosque at 18:20, fearing that a &quot;crisis point&quot; had been reached, and asked him to talk to the gunmen. Three further shots were fired during the course of the imam&#x27;s conversation with Oan. Oan announced that a hostage had been killed, and the rest would die in 30 minutes unless his demands were met. A few minutes later, Lavasani&#x27;s body was dumped out of the front door. Upon a preliminary examination, conducted at the scene, a forensic pathologist estimated that Lavasani had been dead for at least an hour, meaning he could not have been killed by the three most recent shots, and leading the police to believe that two hostages had been killed. In fact, only Lavasani had been shot.

After Lavasani&#x27;s body had been recovered, Sir David McNee, Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, contacted the Home Secretary to request approval to hand control of the operation over to the British Army, under the provisions of Military Aid to the Civil Power. Whitelaw relayed the request to Thatcher, and the prime minister agreed immediately. Thus John Dellow, the ranking police officer at the embassy, signed over control of the operation to Lieutenant-Colonel Rose at 19:07, authorising Rose to order an assault at his discretion. The signed note is now on display at New Scotland Yard&#x27;s Crime Museum. Meanwhile, the police negotiators began stalling Oan. They offered concessions in order to distract him and prevent him killing further hostages, buying time for the SAS to make its final preparations for the now-inevitable assault.

==SAS assault==
The two SAS teams on-scene, Red Team and Blue Team, were ordered to begin their simultaneous assaults, under the codename Operation Nimrod, at 19:23. One group of four men from Red Team abseiled from the roof down the rear of the building, while another four-man team lowered a stun grenade through the skylight. The detonation of the stun grenade was supposed to coincide with the abseiling teams detonating explosives to gain entry to the building through the second-floor windows. During the descent, one of the abseilers became entangled in his rope. While trying to assist him, one of the other soldiers accidentally smashed a window with his foot. The noise of the breaking window alerted Oan, who was on the first floor communicating with the police negotiators, and he went to investigate. The soldiers were unable to use explosives in case they injured their stranded comrade, but managed to smash their way in using sledgehammers.

After the first soldiers entered, a fire started and travelled up the curtains and out of the second-floor window, severely burning the stranded soldier. A second wave of abseilers cut him free, and he fell to the balcony below before entering the embassy. Slightly behind Red Team, Blue Team detonated explosives on a first-floor window, forcing Sim Harris—who had just run into the room—to take cover. Much of the operation at the front of the embassy took place in full view of the assembled journalists and was broadcast on live television, and Harris&#x27;s escape across the parapet of a first-floor balcony was famously captured on video.

As the soldiers emerged onto the first-floor landing, Lock tackled Oan to prevent him attacking the SAS operatives. Oan, still armed, was subsequently shot dead by one of the soldiers. Meanwhile, further teams entered the embassy through the back door and cleared the ground floor and cellar. During the raid, the gunmen holding the male hostages opened fire on their captives, killing Ali Akbar Samadzadeh and wounding two others. The SAS began evacuating hostages, taking them down the stairs towards the back door of the embassy. Two of the terrorists were hiding amongst the hostages; one of them produced a hand grenade when he was identified. An SAS soldier, who was unable to shoot for concern of hitting a hostage or another soldier, pushed the grenade-wielding terrorist to the bottom of the stairs, where two other soldiers shot him dead.

The raid lasted seventeen minutes and involved 30 to 35 soldiers. The terrorists killed one hostage and seriously wounded two others during the raid while the SAS killed all but one of the terrorists. The rescued hostages and the remaining terrorist, who was still concealed amongst them, were taken into the embassy&#x27;s back garden and restrained on the ground while they were identified. The last terrorist was identified by Sim Harris and led away by the SAS.

==Aftermath==
After the end of the siege, PC Trevor Lock was widely considered a hero. He was awarded the George Medal, the United Kingdom&#x27;s second-highest civil honour, for his conduct during the siege and for tackling Oan during the SAS raid, the only time during the siege that he drew his concealed side arm. In addition, he was honoured with the Freedom of the City of London and in a motion in the House of Commons. Police historian Michael J. Waldren, referring to the television series &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot;, suggested that Lock&#x27;s restraint in the use of his revolver was &quot;a defining example of the power of the Dixon image&quot;, and academic Maurice Punch noted the contrast between Lock&#x27;s actions and the highly aggressive tactics of the SAS. 

Another academic, Steven Moysey, commented on the difference in outcomes between the Iranian Embassy siege and the 1975 Balcombe Street siege, in which the police negotiated the surrender of four Provisional Irish Republican Army members without military involvement. Nonetheless, the siege led to calls for increasing the firepower of the police to enable them to prevent and deal with similar incidents in the future, and an official report recommended that specialist police firearms units, such as the Metropolitan Police&#x27;s D11, be better resourced and equipped.

Warrant Officer Class 1 Tommy Goodyear was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Gallantry Medal for his part in the assault, in which he shot dead a terrorist who was apparently about to throw a grenade amongst the hostages. After the operation concluded, the staff sergeant who was caught in his abseil rope was treated at St Stephen&#x27;s Hospital in Fulham. He suffered serious burns to his legs, but made a full recovery.

The Iranian government welcomed the end of the siege, and declared that the two hostages killed were martyrs for the Iranian Revolution. They also thanked the British government for &quot;the persevering action of your police force during the unjust hostage-taking event at the Embassy&quot;.

After the assault concluded, the police conducted an investigation into the siege and the deaths of the two hostages and five terrorists, including the actions of the SAS. The soldiers&#x27; weapons were taken away for examination and, the following day, the soldiers themselves were interviewed at length by the police at the regiment&#x27;s base in Hereford. There was controversy over the deaths of two terrorists in the telex room, where the male hostages were held. Hostages later said in interviews that they had persuaded their captors to surrender and television footage appeared to show them throwing weapons out of the window and holding a white flag. The two SAS soldiers who killed the men both stated at the inquest into the terrorists&#x27; deaths that they believed the men had been reaching for weapons before they were shot. The inquest jury reached the verdict that the soldiers&#x27; actions were justifiable homicide (later known as &quot;lawful killing&quot;).

Fowzi Nejad was the only gunman to survive the SAS assault. After being identified, he was dragged away by an SAS trooper, who allegedly intended to take him back into the building and shoot him. The soldier reportedly changed his mind when it was pointed out to him that the raid was being broadcast on live television. It later emerged that the footage from the back of the embassy was coming from a wireless camera placed in the window of a flat overlooking the embassy. The camera had been installed by ITN technicians, who had posed as guests of a local resident in order to get past the police cordon, which had been in place since the beginning of the siege. Nejad was arrested, and was eventually tried, convicted, and sentenced to life imprisonment for his role in the siege. He became eligible for parole in 2005.

As a foreign national, he would normally have been immediately deported to his home country but Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, incorporated into British law by the Human Rights Act 1998, has been held by the European Court of Human Rights to prohibit deportation in cases where the person concerned would be likely to be tortured or executed in his home country. Nejad was eventually paroled in 2008 and granted leave to remain in the UK, but was not given political asylum. The Home Office released a statement, saying &quot;We do not give refugee status to convicted terrorists. Our aim is to deport people as quickly as possible but the law requires us to first obtain assurances that the person being returned will not face certain death&quot;. After 27 years in prison, Nejad was deemed no longer to be a threat to society, but Trevor Lock wrote to the Home Office to oppose his release. Because it is accepted by the British government that he would be executed or tortured, he cannot be deported to Iran; he now lives in south London, having assumed another identity.

==Long-term impact==

Prior to 1980, London had been the scene of several terrorist incidents related to Middle East politics, including the assassination of the former prime minister of the Republic of Yemen, and an attack on a coach containing staff from the Israeli airline El Al. Although there were other isolated incidents relating to Middle Eastern and North African politics in the years following the embassy siege, most prominently the murder of Yvonne Fletcher from inside the Libyan embassy in 1984, historian Jerry White believed the resolution of the siege &quot;effectively marked the end of London&#x27;s three years as a world theatre for the resolution of Middle Eastern troubles&quot;.

The SAS raid, codenamed &quot;Operation Nimrod&quot;, was broadcast live at peak time on a bank holiday Monday evening and was viewed by millions of people, mostly in the UK, making it a defining moment in British history. Both the BBC and ITV interrupted their scheduled programming, the BBC interrupting the broadcast of the World Snooker Championship final, to show the end of the siege, which proved to be a major career boost for several journalists. Kate Adie, the BBC&#x27;s duty reporter at the embassy when the SAS assault began, went on to cover Nejad&#x27;s trial and then to report from war zones across the world and eventually to become chief news correspondent for BBC News, while David Goldsmith and his team, responsible for the hidden camera at the back of the embassy, were awarded a BAFTA for their coverage. The success of the operation, combined with the high profile it was given by the media, invoked a sense of national pride compared to Victory in Europe Day, the end of the Second World War in Europe. The operation was declared &quot;an almost unqualified success&quot;. Margaret Thatcher recalled that she was congratulated wherever she went over the following days, and received messages of support and congratulation from other world leaders. However, the incident strained already-tense relations between the UK and Iran following the Iranian Revolution. The Iranian government declared that the siege of the embassy was planned by the British and American governments, and that the hostages who had been killed were martyrs for the Revolution.

Operation Nimrod brought the SAS, a regiment that had fallen into obscurity after its fame during the Second World War (partly owing to the covert nature of its operations), back into the public eye. The regiment was not pleased with its new high profile. Nonetheless, the operation vindicated the SAS, which had been at risk of disbandment and whose use of resources had been considered wasteful. The regiment was quickly overwhelmed by new applicants. Membership of 22 SAS is open only to those currently serving in the Armed Forces (allowing applications from any individual in any service), but the unit also has two regiments from the volunteer Territorial Army (TA): 21 SAS and 23 SAS. Both the TA regiments received hundreds more applications than in previous years, prompting de la Billière to remark that the applicants seemed &quot;convinced that a balaclava helmet and a sub-machine gun would be handed to them over the counter, so that they could go off and conduct embassy-style sieges of their own&quot;. Meanwhile, the SAS became a sought-after assignment for career army officers. All three units were forced to introduce additional fitness tests at the start of the application process. The SAS also experienced an increased demand for their expertise in training the forces of friendly countries and those whose collapse was considered not to be in Britain&#x27;s interest. The government developed a protocol for lending the SAS to foreign governments to assist with hijackings or sieges, and it became fashionable for politicians to be seen associating with the regiment. Despite its new fame, the SAS did not have a high profile during the 1982 Falklands War, partly due to a lack of operations, and next came to the fore during the 1990–1991 Gulf War.

The British government&#x27;s response to the crisis, and the successful use of force to end it, strengthened the Conservative government of the day and boosted Thatcher&#x27;s personal credibility. McNee believed that the conclusion of the siege exemplified the British government&#x27;s policy of refusing to give in to terrorist demands, &quot;nowhere was the effectiveness of this response to terrorism more effectively demonstrated&quot;.

The embassy building was severely damaged by fire. It was more than a decade before the British and Iranian governments came to an agreement whereby the United Kingdom would repair the damage to the embassy in London and Iran would pay for repairs to the British embassy in Tehran, which had been damaged during the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Iranian diplomats began working from 16 Prince&#x27;s Gate again in December 1993.

The DRFLA was undermined by its links with the Iraqi government after it emerged that Iraq had sponsored the training and equipping of the hostage-takers. The Iran–Iraq War started five months after the end of the siege and continued for eight years. The campaign for autonomy of Khūzestān was largely forgotten in the wake of the hostilities, as was the DRFLA.

== Cultural impact ==
As well as factual television documentaries, the dramatic conclusion of the siege inspired a wave of fictional works about the SAS in the form of novels, television programmes, and films. Among them were the 1982 film &quot;Who Dares Wins&quot; and the 2017 film &quot;6 Days&quot;, which was released on Netflix. The siege features in the 2006 video game &quot;The Regiment&quot;, and &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six Siege&quot; – a 2015 tactical shooter video game focusing on counter-terrorism – uses the Iranian Embassy Siege as inspiration, with a playable character having canonically participated in the siege. The SAS also feature in the book &quot;Rainbow Six&quot;, upon which the game series was based. The embassy siege was referenced multiple times in the television drama &quot;Ultimate Force&quot; (2002–2008), which stars Ross Kemp as the leader of a fictional SAS unit. As well as fictional representations in media, the siege inspired a version of Palitoy&#x27;s Action Man figure, clad in black and equipped with a gas mask, mimicking the soldiers who stormed the embassy.

<text>Operation Anklet was the codename given to a British Commando raid during the Second World War. The raid on the Lofoten Islands was carried out in December 1941, by 300 men from No. 12 Commando and the Norwegian Independent Company 1. The landing party was supported by 22 ships from three navies.

At the same time, another raid was taking place in Vågsøy. This raid was Operation Archery, on 27 December 1941, and Operation Anklet was seen as a diversionary raid for this bigger raid, intended to draw away the German naval and air forces.

==Background==
After the British Expeditionary Force had been evacuated from Dunkirk in 1940, the then British Prime Minister Winston Churchill called for a force to be assembled and equipped to inflict casualties on the Germans and bolster British morale. Churchill told the joint Chiefs of Staff to propose measures for an offensive against German-occupied Europe, and stated: &quot;they must be prepared with specially trained troops of the hunter class who can develop a reign of terror down the enemy coast.&quot;

One staff officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Dudley Clarke, had already submitted such a proposal to General Sir John Dill, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff. Dill, aware of Churchill&#x27;s intentions, approved Clarke&#x27;s proposal.

The Commandos came under the operational control of the Combined Operations Headquarters. The man initially selected as the commander was Admiral Sir Roger Keyes, a veteran of the Gallipoli Campaign and the Zeebrugge Raid in the First World War. In 1940, the call went out for volunteers from among the serving Army soldiers within certain formations still in Britain, and men of the disbanding Divisional Independent Companies originally raised from Territorial Army Divisions who had seen service in Norway.

The Lofoten Islands form part of the north western Norwegian coastline about inside the Arctic Circle. Operation Anklet would be the second raid on the islands. The first, Operation Claymore, had taken place in March 1941, and the third raid, Operation Archery, would take place at the same time as Operation Anklet.

The raid was organised by the Combined Operations Headquarters, and would only use naval and land assets, the Royal Air Force was not involved. But it would be the last raid undertaken without air support.

The naval force formed for Operation Anklet consisted of 22 ships from three navies. The Royal Navy provided the most ships which included the light cruiser ; six destroyers (, , , , and ); three minesweepers (, and ); two Landing Ship Infantry (HMS &quot;Prins Albert&quot; and &quot;Prinses Josephine Charlotte&quot;); the submarines , ; and the survey ship . The Royal Fleet Auxiliary provided two fleet tankers (RFA &quot;Grey Ranger&quot; and &quot;Black Ranger&quot;); the freighter &quot;Gudrun Maersk&quot;; and the Tugboat &quot;Jaunty&quot;.

The exiled Royal Norwegian Navy provided the corvettes HNoMS &quot;Andenes&quot; and &quot;Eglantine&quot;, while the Polish Navy provided the destroyers ORP &quot;Krakowiak&quot; and &quot;Kujawiak&quot;.

The landing force was supplied by 223 men of No. 12 Commando, supported by 77 men of the Norwegian Independent Company 1.

==Mission==
The naval task force was assembled at three locations: Scapa Flow, Greenock and Lerwick. The task force, now known as Force J, left Scapa and Greenock for the Lofoten Islands on Monday 22 December, and those at Lerwick the following day. &quot;En route&quot; to join up with the main force, the infantry landing ship &quot;Prinses Josephine Charlotte&quot; developed engine trouble, and together with her destroyer escort &quot;Wheatland&quot; was sent back to Scapa, arriving on 24 December. &quot;Wheatland&quot; left Scapa alone on 25 December to catch up with the rest of Force J. As the task force approached the islands, the submarine &quot;Sealion&quot; was already in position to act as a navigational beacon for the attack, which was planned for 26 December.

When the task force arrived, the infantry landing ship &quot;Prins Albert&quot;, escorted by destroyer &quot;Lamerton&quot; and corvettes &quot;Eglantine&quot; and &quot;Acanthus&quot;, headed towards Moskenesøya to land the commandos. Some of the other ships conducted operations around the islands. The destroyer &quot;Bedouin&quot; destroyed a radio station at Flakstadøya, while the cruiser &quot;Arethusa&quot; and destroyers &quot;Somali&quot;, &quot;Ashanti&quot;, and &quot;Eskimo&quot; entered the Vestfjorden. Here they captured the Norwegian coastal steamers &quot;Kong Harald&quot; and &quot;Nordland&quot; and &quot;Ashanti&quot; sank a German patrol boat.

The 300-man landing force landed at 06:00 on Boxing Day. The date had been selected by British planners, who expected the German garrison to be concentrating on the Christmas festivities and would therefore be caught unprepared. The landings were unopposed as the commandos, dressed in white camouflaged overalls, were landed on the western side of the island of Moskenesøya. They soon occupied the villages of Reine and Moskenes, capturing the small German garrison and a number of Norwegian Quislings at the radio station at Glåpen.
The raiding force was attacked on 27 December 1941 by a German seaplane that bombed the cruiser &quot;Arethusa&quot;. Although it was not hit, it did suffer some damage that would require 14 weeks in dock to repair. With no air support of their own, the commander of the raid, Admiral Hamilton, having occupied the Norwegian villages for two days, decided to pull out and head back to Scapa, where they arrived on 1 January 1942.

==Aftermath==
During Operation Anklet, two radio transmitters were destroyed, several small German boats were captured or sunk, and a small number of Germans and Quislings were made prisoners of war. The navy also captured an Enigma coding machine, with its associated wheels and settings, from the patrol ship they had sunk. They also returned with over 200 Norwegians who volunteered to serve in the Free Norwegian Forces. The raid was successful, with no casualties to the Allied force. At least one lesson seemed to have been learnt, as it was the last raid undertaken without air support. During the war, there were 12 commando raids directed against Norway. The German response was to increase the number of troops they stationed there. By 1944, the German garrison in Norway had increased to 370,000 men. A British infantry division in 1944 had 18,347 men.

<text>José Marcelo Salas Melinao (; born 24 December 1974), nicknamed &quot;Matador&quot; (due to his goalscoring celebrations), &quot;El Fenómeno&quot; and &quot;Shileno&quot;, is a Chilean former footballer who played as a striker. Salas is considered the best striker in the history of Chile. He stood out during the 1990s and 2000s in clubs such as Universidad de Chile, River Plate, Lazio and Juventus. He was the captain of the Chile national team and the top scorer – scoring 45 goals in total: 37 goals for the Chile national football team (4 in World Cups, 18 in World Cup qualification processes and 15 in friendlies) and 8 goals with the Chile Olympic football team.

He played in Chile, Argentina and Italy, winning titles with each club he joined.

The IFFHS ranked him as the 31st best South American player of the 20th century, the 19th best South American forward of the 20th century and the 3rd best South American forward of the 1990s (integrating the podium with Brazilians players Ronaldo and Romário). In 1997 he ranked 3rd as the &quot;best centre forward in the world&quot; (after players Ronaldo and Gabriel Batistuta) and he was ranked 5th in the &quot;Best Centre Forward&quot; category in the RSS Award for the best footballer of the year, in 1998 and 1999. He was also named the South American Footballer of the Year in 1997.

A powerful and tenacious forward, with good technique, who was well-known for his deft touch with his left foot, as well as his aerial ability, Salas had a prolific goalscoring record throughout his career. Between 1996 and 2001 he was considered one of the best forwards in the world, often compared to Ronaldo and Gabriel Batistuta.

Salas is considered one of the greatest players in the history of Universidad de Chile, an icon for the football team River Plate of Argentina, and one of the greatest foreign players in Lazio&#x27;s history. He played for the Chile national football team at the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France, where he scored four goals in four matches, leading his team to the second round of the competition. Additionally, Salas played for the Chile national football team at two Copa América tournaments, helping his team to reach fourth place in the 1999 edition of the tournament.

Currently, after his retirement as a football player, he has continued linked to the sport, being since May 2013 the president of Deportes Temuco (a club that on that date absorbed Unión Temuco, owned by him from 2008 to April 2013). The club is now in 2nd division of Chile, the Primera B.

==Club career==
===Universidad de Chile===
Born in Temuco, Salas played for the Deportes Temuco youth team until his father took him to Santiago de Chile to be incorporated into the Universidad de Chile team.

Salas joined the Universidad de Chile team in 1993 and debuted on 4 January 1994 in a match against Cobreloa where he scored a goal. Finally, Salas was consolidated in the match against Colo Colo at the National Stadium, where he scored a Hat-trick in the 4–1 victory. His great performances quickly led the university fans to give him the nickname of &quot;Matador&quot; due to his cold blood when defining, also inspired by the song of the same name by the Argentine musical group Los Fabulosos Cadillacs, which at that time was fashionable in Latin America. It was also at this time that he patented his particular way of celebrating goals: he put one leg down, bowed his head, stretched his right arm and pointed his index finger towards the sky.

Salas helped the team win back-to-back titles in 1994 and 1995, he was an essential player for the Universidad de Chile team, as he was their top scorer in both seasons (27 goals in the first season and 17 goals in the second season). Leaving a trail of 76 goals which included a strong 1996 campaign in the Copa Libertadores.

===River Plate===
Later in 1996, Salas moved to Argentina to play in River Plate team of the Argentine first division of football. On 30 September 1996 he scored his first goal, in a match played against Boca Juniors at the La Bombonera stadium. From 1996 to 1998 Salas scored 31 goals in 67 games, helping River to win the Torneo de Apertura 1996 (where he scored two goals in the 3–0 win over Vélez Sarsfield that made him champion), the Clausura 1997, the Apertura 1997 (scoring the title goal against Argentinos Juniors), and the 1997 Supercopa Libertadores, where he scored the 2 goals in the final against São Paulo that gave the millionaire club the cup. In addition, he was elected the Best Footballer of the season in Argentina and South American Footballer of the Year in 1997. These accomplishments would cement his legacy in Argentina as one of its greatest foreign born players earning the nickname, &quot;El shileno (sic) Salas&quot;.

The Argentine team valued his transfer at US$30,000,000 as the English football club Manchester United (The coach Alex Ferguson wanted a player with the characteristics of Ronaldo and Marcelo Salas to replace the retirement of Eric Cantona, Ferguson traveled 14,000 miles to sign Salas, but River Plate refused to sell him.), in addition to great clubs from Italy and Spain for hiring him.

===Lazio===
On 1 February 1998, thanks to his good performances both in Argentina and in the Chile national football team, he was sold to SS Lazio in Italy for US$20.5 million. becoming the highest transfer in history at that time, after Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Denilson (to Inter Milan from Italy, Barcelona and Betis from Spain, respectively).

Salas played in Italy for five years: three years with SS Lazio (1998–2001), a key catalyst in helping turn around a Lazio team that hadn&#x27;t won a Scudetto since the 1973–1974 season. He made his debut for Lazio on 12 August 1998 against the UEFA Champions League champion, the Real Madrid of Spain, where he scored the second goal of his team, in the Teresa Herrera Trophy. His official debut was for the Supercoppa italiana where his team won the competition after winning 2–1 over Juventus FC, on 29 August 1998. With Salas in the team, successes in Italian football returned for the whole of the Italian capital, after 25 years. He scored his first goal for Serie A playing for Lazio a few days later against Inter Milan. With Lazio he won a Serie A (being Salas the team&#x27;s top scorer with 12 annotations), an Coppa Italia, two Supercoppa Italiana, a UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and a UEFA Super Cup, scoring the match&#x27;s only goal in the latter, in a 1–0 win over Manchester United.

Salas quickly became an idol of the Lazio tifosi, where they dedicated songs to him, the most traditional was: &quot;Matador, Matador, che ce frega de Ronaldo noi c&#x27;avemo er Matador&quot; (Matador, Matador, what do we care about Ronaldo if we have the Matador).

After rejecting offers of US$30,000,000 from important football club as: Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool, Barcelona, Parma, AC Milan and Inter Milan. was in negotiations with Real Madrid to become, together with Zinedine Zidane, one of the two great &quot;meringues&quot; signings of 2001. However, the transfer failed, largely due to the exorbitant sum that the Spanish club had invested in the signing of Zidane. Finally, that same year he signed for Juventus, with the club paying €25,000,000 (US$28,500,000) for him, which at the time was the most expensive transfer of a Chilean player.

===Juventus===
In 2001, he was transferred to Juventus for 55 billion lire (€28.5 million by fixed exchange rate; 22 billion lire cash plus Darko Kovačević). His stay in Turin was cut short due to a torn ACL in his right knee in a Serie A match against Bologna in October 2001. Salas endured one of the worst moments of his career at the club; he was hampered by injuries, including a further issue with his knee meniscus the following season, allowing him to participate in only 26 games and scoring just 4 goals across all competitions.

===Return to River Plate ===
After Juventus unsuccessfully tried to transfer him to such high-profile European clubs as Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool, Barcelona, A.C. Milan, and Sporting Lisbon (in exchange for the transfer of a young Cristiano Ronaldo), in 2003 he was loaned back to River Plate.

Hailed as &quot;Saint Matador&quot; by fans, Salas stood out especially in that year&#x27;s Copa Sudamericana, but could not prevent his team&#x27;s defeat in the final against Cienciano of Peru, despite scoring the tying goal 3–3 in the first leg. However, he later achieved a new title: the 2004 Clausura.

A year later, he helped River Plate reach the semifinals of the 2005 Copa Libertadores, scoring a hat-trick against Liga de Quito. In his second stay at River Plate, Salas scored 17 goals in 43 games.

Marcelo Salas is regarded as one of the greatest players in the history of River Plate, along with Ángel Labruna, Enzo Francescoli, Ramón Díaz, Norberto Alonso, Ubaldo Fillol and Amadeo Carrizo. In addition, he was one of the few foreign players who have worn the &quot;Millonarios&quot; captain armband.

===Universidad de Chile===
Between 2004 and 2005 he received offers to return to European football from Barcelona in Spain and Inter Milan in Italy, among others.

In late July 2005, it was confirmed that he would return to his original team, Universidad de Chile, on a temporary deal from Juventus.

Salas announced his retirement on 28 November 2008, at the age of 33. Before the 23 November game where the Universidad de Chile beat Cobreloa 3–2, with two goals from Salas at the National Stadium.

Salas played his last game on 2 June 2009. Amongst the invited players were his friends from the 1993–1996 Universidad de Chile squads, River Plate, Juventus, plus members of Chile&#x27;s France &#x27;98 World Cup squad. More than 60,000 people attended to pay him one final salute. Playing for both sides, he managed to score three goals.

In a memorable match, Chile won 2–0 with goals of &quot;The Killer&quot;. The first, of great invoice, with perfect control, spin and definition, without letting the ball touch the ground after a pass of more than 60 meters. The second, a penalty that he created after brilliantly dribbling the English defender Sol Campbell.
