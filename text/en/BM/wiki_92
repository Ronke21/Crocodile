<text>In dogs, hip dysplasia is an abnormal formation of the hip socket that, in its more severe form, can eventually cause lameness and arthritis of the joints. It is a genetic (polygenic) trait that is affected by environmental factors. It is common in many dog breeds, particularly the larger breeds, and is the most common single cause of arthritis of the hips.

==Overview==
===Normal hip anatomy===
In the normal anatomy of the hip joint, the almost spherical end of the femur head (the caput, or caput ossis femoris) fits into the acetabulum (a concave socket located in the pelvis). The bony surfaces of the femur head and of the acetabulum are covered by cartilage. While bones provide the strength necessary to support body weight, cartilage ensures a smooth fit and a wide range of motion. Normal hip function can be affected by congenital conditions such as dysplasia, trauma, and by acquired diseases such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.

===Dysplastic hip anatomy===
The hip could have major contractions from dysplasias. The caput is not deeply and tightly held by the acetabulum. Instead of being a snug fit, it is a loose fit, or a partial fit. Secondly, the caput or acetabulum are not smooth and round, but are misshapen, causing abnormal wear and tear or friction within the joint as it moves.
The body reacts to this in several ways. First, the joint is continually repairing itself and laying down new cartilage. However, cartilage repair is a relatively slow process, the tissue being avascular, so the joint may suffer degradation due to the abnormal wear and tear, or may not support the body weight as intended. The joint becomes inflamed and a cycle of cartilage damage, inflammation and pain commences. This is a self-fueling process, in that the more the joint becomes damaged, the more damage it will cause to the surrounding tissues and bones. The inflammation also causes further damage. The bones of the joint may also develop osteoarthritis, visible on a radiograph as small outcrops of bone, which further degrade the joint. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative disease marked by the breakdown of cartilage between joints resulting in painful bone-to-bone contact.

The underlying deformity of the joint may get worse over time, or may remain static. A dog may have good radiographs and yet be in pain, or may have very poor radiographs and have no apparent pain issues. The hip condition is only one factor to determine the extent to which dysplasia is causing pain or affecting the quality of life. In mild to moderate dysplasia it is often the secondary effects of abnormal wear and tear or arthritis, rather than dysplasia itself, which is the direct causes of visible problems.

===Causes and effects===

Hip dysplasia may be caused by a femur that does not fit correctly into the pelvic socket, or poorly developed muscles in the pelvic area. Large and giant breeds are most susceptible to hip dysplasia (possibly due to the body mass index (BMI) of the individual animal), though many other breeds can suffer from it. The Orthopedic Foundation for Animals maintains a list of top 100 breeds affected.

To reduce pain, the animal will typically reduce its movement of that hip. This may be visible as &quot;bunny hopping&quot;, where both legs move together, or less dynamic movement (running, jumping), or stiffness. Since the hip cannot move fully, the body compensates by adapting its use of the spine, often causing spinal, stifle (a dog&#x27;s knee joint), or soft tissue problems to arise.

The causes of hip dysplasia are considered heritable, but new research conclusively suggests that environment also plays a role. To what degree the causality is genetic and what portion environmental is a topic of current debate. Neutering a dog, especially before the dog has reached an age of full developmental maturity, has been shown to almost double the chance he or she will develop hip dysplasia versus intact dogs or dogs that were neutered after reaching adulthood. Other environmental influences include overweight condition, injury at a young age, overexertion on the hip joint at a young age, ligament tear at a young age, or repetitive motion on forming joint (e.g. jogging with puppy under the age of 1 year). As current studies progress, greater information may help provide procedures to effectively reduce the occurrence of this condition.

It is most common in medium-large pure bred dogs, such as Newfoundlands, German Shepherd Dogs, retrievers (such as Labradors, Tollers, or Goldens), Rottweilers and Mastiffs, but also occurs in some smaller breeds such as spaniels and pugs.

==Clinical detection and testing==
===Symptoms===

Dogs with hip dysplasia may exhibit the following signs and symptoms:

*Decreased activity 
*Decreased range of motion
*Difficulty or reluctance rising, jumping, running, or climbing stairs
*Lameness in the hind end
*Looseness in the joint
*Narrow stance
*Swaying, &quot;bunny hopping&quot; gait
*Grating in the joint during movement 
*Loss of thigh muscle mass
*Noticeable enlargement of the shoulder muscles as they compensate for the hind end 
*Pain
*Stiffness or soreness after rising from rest
*Subluxation or dislocation of the hip joint
*Caudolateral curvilinear osteophyte, sometimes called Morgan&#x27;s line, a thickened osteophyte on the caudal aspect of the femoral neck

Affected dogs can show clinical signs as early as seven months of age, but most do not until one to two years of age. In part this is because the underlying hip problem may be mild or severe, worsening or stable, and the body may be more or less able to keep the joint in repair well enough to cope.

===Diagnosis===
Hip dysplasia is diagnosed with radiographs of the pelvis. There are several standardized systems for categorising dysplasia, set out by reputable bodies. The most widely used systems include the following:
It is also common to X-ray the spine and legs, as well as the hips, since soft tissues can be affected by the extra strain of a dysplastic hip, or there may be other undetected factors such as neurological issues (e.g. nerve damage) involved.

===Other conditions with similar symptoms===
The following conditions can give symptoms very similar to hip dysplasia, and should be ruled out during diagnosis:
* Cauda equina syndrome (i.e. lower back problems)
* Cranial (anterior) Cruciate ligament tears
* Other rear limb arthritic conditions
* Osteochondritis dissecans and elbow dysplasia in the forelimbs are difficult to diagnose as the animal may only exhibit an unusual gait, and may be masked by, or misdiagnosed as, hip dysplasia.

A dog may misuse its rear legs, or adapt its gait, to compensate for pain in the &quot;forelimbs&quot;, notably osteoarthritis, osteochondritis (OCD) or shoulder or elbow dysplasia, as well as pain in the hocks and stifles or spinal issues. It is important to rule out other joint and bodily issues before concluding that only hip dysplasia is present. Even if some hip dysplasia is present, it is possible for other conditions to co-exist or be masked by it.

==Treatment==
There is no complete cure, although there are many options to alleviate the clinical signs. The aim of treatment is to enhance quality of life.

Most dogs with hip dysplasia do not need surgery as they do very well with a home physical therapy program, keeping trim and strong, and using pain medication as needed.

If the problem cannot be controlled with medications, then often surgery is considered. There are traditionally two types of surgery - those which reshape the joint to reduce pain or help movement, and hip replacement which completely replaces the damaged hip with an artificial joint, similar to human hip replacements.

===Non-surgical interventions===
Non surgical intervention is dependent on many factors including age, weight, degree of hip laxity, lifestyle of the owner and their tolerance for the cost incurred for medication and physical therapy.

==== Maintenance of minimal body weight ====
Weight control is often &quot;the single most important thing that we can do to help a dog with arthritis,&quot; and &quot;reducing the dog&#x27;s weight is enough to control all of the symptoms of arthritis in many dogs.&quot; With weight control, the goal is to prevent the dog from becoming overweight to reduce mechanical stresses applied to the hip joints. In general terms, the ribs should be easily palpated and there should be an indentation in front of the hip bones.

==== Exercise routine ====
Reasonable exercise stimulates cartilage growth and reduces degeneration, and also regular walks taken in the early stages of dysplasia can help prevent loss of muscle mass to the hips. Exercise should fit an individual dog&#x27;s maximum intensity level with the goal to maintain muscle tone and cardiovascular function without causing pain, stiffness, and inflammation to the joint. Exercise also improves joint range of motion which in turn keeps the dog more comfortable. Swimming, because it is a non-weight bearing exercise, can be a very useful means of maintaining muscle tone and range of motion without placing concussive forces on the joint, though swimming is primarily a front-legged exercise.

==== Medication ====
Medication can reduce pain and discomfort, and also reduce damaging inflammation. Most often, medication consists of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), which doubles as an anti-inflammatory and painkiller. Typical NSAIDs used for hip dysplasia include carprofen and meloxicam (often sold as Rimadyl and Metacam respectively). Both are used to treat arthritis resulting from dysplasia, although other NSAIDs such as tepoxalin (Zubrin) and prednoleucotropin (&quot;PLT&quot;, a combination of cinchophen and prednisolone) are sometimes prescribed.

==== Diet supplementation ====
Incorporating omega-3 fatty acids such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) into the diet can result in improved symptoms of the disease. Omega-3 fatty acids can help decrease inflammation that occurs from osteoarthritis, as well as improve the locomotion of dogs who have the disease. EPA and DHA can be supplemented into the diet through fish oils.

Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate are nutraceuticals that can also be added into the diet to help treat osteoarthritis caused by hip dysplasia. Both nutraceuticals help with improvement of cartilage, joint health and repairing of tissues. A glucosamine-based nutritional supplement may give the body additional raw materials used in joint repair. Glucosamine can take 3–4 weeks to start showing its effects, so the trial period for medication is usually at least 3–5 weeks. In vitro, glucosamine has been shown to have negative effects on cartilage cells.

Another nutrient that can help improve the structural support of the body is vitamin C. Vitamin C contributes to the building blocks of collagen that can help to strengthen the joints.

===Surgical interventions===
Surgical procedures attempt to modify, repair, or replace the hip joint in order to allow pain-free usage.

*&quot;Femoral head ostectomy (FHO)&quot; is when the head of the femur is removed but not replaced. Instead, the resulting scar tissue from the operation takes the place of the hip joint. This false joint is less stable with a reduced range of motion than a normal joint, causing an abnormal gait. Nevertheless, pain relief with adequate function can be achieved. The procedure can be performed in all dogs of all sizes, but there are usually better long-term success rates in smaller dogs less than 20 kg (44 lbs). This procedure is used when there is significant osteoarthritis and a total hip replacement is cost-prohibitive.
*&quot;Triple pelvic osteotomy (TPO)&quot; involves bone cuts in the pelvis so that the socket portion of the joint can be rotated over the ball; the bones are then stabilized with a bone plate. This procedure is indicated for dogs under 10 months of age. A TPO can be performed to reestablish joint stability and encourage normal joint development. This procedure is not indicated if osteoarthritis is already present. Recovery time is about six weeks.
*&quot;Hip replacement&quot; has the highest rate of success, especially in severe cases, since it completely replaces the faulty joint. It usually restores complete mobility if no other joint is affected, and also completely prevents recurrence. It is ideal for dogs over 10 months old that already have established osteoarthritis and can no longer be medically managed. Hip replacement is also the preferred clinical option for serious dysplasia in animals that weigh .
*&quot;Juvenile pubic symphysiodesis (JPS)&quot; is a procedure for very young dogs that manipulates the way the pelvis grows to create a tighter hip. It involves cauterizing the growth plates of the pelvis to halt vertical growth. To compensate, the rest of the pelvis grows outward, in a manner which enhances the &quot;socket&quot; of the hip and provides better support than the dog would have had naturally. Since it relies on growth in puppyhood, it has a very tight window for surgery – between 4 and 5 months old. This is compatible with hip scoring of puppies at 4 months.
*&quot;Capsular neurectomy&quot; is a procedure in which the hip joint capsule is de-nerved to reduce pain in the hip. This allows the dog to exercise moderately with less pain, thus preventing the leg muscles from weakening from disuse and providing less support to the bad joint. Both hips can be done in one surgery. This surgery should not prevent a future hip replacement if a more complete fix is desired.

<text>The New 1st Army () was a prominent military unit of the Chinese National Revolutionary Army. It was nicknamed the &quot;First Army Under Heaven&quot; during the Chinese Civil War and played a significant role during the Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945), where it inflicted substantial casualties on the Imperial Japanese Army.

== History ==
Formed from the X Force, particularly the New 38th Division, the New 1st Army was among the top five Nationalist crack units. The other four included the New 6th Army, the Reorganized 11th Division (army-sized, formerly known as the 18th Army and later reverted to its original designation), the Reorganized 74th Division (army sized, formerly known as the 74th Army), and the 5th Army.

After the New 38th Division under Sun Li-jen and New 22nd Division under Liao Yao-hsiang retreated to India from Burma in the first phase of the Burma Campaign, the two divisions obtained American equipment and training at Ramgarh, India. There the New 1st Army was formed in February 1943 with the three divisions: the New 38th, the New 22nd and the New 30th. Lieutenant-General Qiu Qingquan was appointed its commander, but was soon replaced by Lieutenant-General Cheng Tung-kuo. Sun Li-jen served as the deputy commander but took over tactical command at the beginning of the second phase of the Burma Campaign. In May 1944, Sun was promoted its commander.

During the Chinese Civil War, the New 1st Army was deployed to Northeast China to fight against Chinese Communist Party military units under Lin Biao. It saw much success in the early battles. However, after some time, Sun was dismissed as commander after offending important members of the KMT, including his superior, Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s favorite Lieutenant-General Du Yuming. Sun was replaced by Lieutenant-General Pan Yukun on 26 April 1947. Most officers above battalion level were also dismissed. This dealt a huge blow to the New 1st Army and it began to suffer heavy losses. The Army saw its last action in the effort to relieve the KMT-controlled city of Jinzhou in late October 1948 as part of General Liao Yao-hsiang&#x27;s 9th Army Corps. The entire army was wiped out. General Pan barely escaped with his life. The commanders of the three divisions (New 30th, 50th and Provisional 53rd) were either captured or surrendered. Due to this army&#x27;s group uneasy history with both the KMT and Chinese Communist Party, its successes are rarely talked about across both mainland China and Taiwan.

<text>Jim Watt MBE (born 18 July 1948) is a Scottish former boxer and commentator who became world champion in the lightweight division when Roberto Durán left the title vacant in 1979 and the WBC had him fight Alfredo Pitalua. Watt knocked out Pitalua in twelve rounds.

==Boxing career==
Raised in the Bridgeton and Possilpark neighbourhoods of Glasgow, Watt trained at Cardowan Amateur Boxing Club in the city&#x27;s Maryhill district. His father died when Jim was five years old. He came to prominence in 1968 by beating John H. Stracey to the ABA Championships; he turned professional immediately afterwards, declining the chance to compete as an amateur at the 1968 Summer Olympic Games in Mexico City.

Watt beat such notables as future world champion Sean O&#x27;Grady, former world champion Perico Fernandez, Charlie Nash and Howard Davis Jr. The fight with O&#x27;Grady was particularly controversial: Watt won by a knockout in round twelve when the referee stopped the fight because of a cut suffered by O&#x27;Grady. According to the book, &quot;The Ring: Boxing The 20th Century&quot;, the cut was produced by a head-butt, in which case the judges&#x27; scorecards would have been checked, and whoever was ahead given the win by a technical decision, Watt was ahead on all the scorecards. The referee, however, declared that O&#x27; Grady&#x27;s cut had been produced by a punch and Watt officially won the fight by technical knockout. 

Watt had also fought, and lost to, Ken Buchanan after 15 rounds in 1973. On 20 June 1981, he fought his last fight, when losing the WBC world Lightweight title to Alexis Argüello by a 15-round decision in London. The three judges&#x27; scores were 147–143, 147–143 and 147–137. Watt retired with a record of 38 wins (27 by knockout) and 8 losses (3 by knockout).

== After boxing ==
Watt was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1980 Birthday Honours for services to boxing. He was long-term co-commentator with Reg Gutteridge on ITV&#x27;s &quot;The Big Fight Live&quot; and moved with Gutteridge to Sky Sports in 1996 when ITV withdrew from boxing coverage. During 2016, Watt announced his retirement as a boxing commentator.

Watt made a special guest appearance on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Still Game&quot; sitcom in August 2007, as well as television adverts for Kelvin Timber (a Scottish home and building supplies stores company) in the 1980s. He and his family settled in the town of Kirkintilloch to the north of Glasgow.

== Personal life==
In June 2015, Watt&#x27;s 38-year-old daughter Michelle Watt took her own life after suffering chronic headaches caused by a spinal operation. She appeared in various programmes as a television hostess, including &quot;60 Minute Makeover&quot;. Watt&#x27;s 17-year-old son James died in a car crash in 1995.

<text>Coffin v. United States, 156 U.S. 432 (1895), was an appellate case before the United States Supreme Court in 1895 which established the presumption of innocence of persons accused of crimes in a landmark decision.

F. A. Coffin and Percival B. Coffin, , and A. S. Reed had been charged with aiding and abetting the former president of the Indianapolis National Bank, Theodore P. Haughey, in misdemeanor bank fraud between January 1, 1891, and July 26, 1893.

It is a complex case with a 50-count indictment. But the most interesting aspect is commentary by the Court regarding presumption of innocence:

In the decision, the Court then goes on to detail the complete legal history of presumed innocence.

<doc id="425329" wikidata="Q7713092" url="?curid=425329" title="Algiers Motel killings">
<text>The Algiers Motel incident (also called the Algiers Motel murders) occurred in Detroit, Michigan, United States, throughout the night of July 25–26, 1967, during the racially charged 12th Street Riot. At the Algiers Motel, approximately one mile east of where the riot began, three civilians were killed and nine others abused by a riot task force composed of the Detroit Police Department, the Michigan State Police, and the Michigan Army National Guard. Among the casualties were three black teenage boys killed, and two white women and seven black men wounded. The task force was searching the area after reports were received that a gunman or group of gunmen, possibly snipers, had been seen at or near the motel.

One death has never been explained as the body was allegedly found by responding officers. Two deaths have been attributed to &quot;justifiable homicide&quot; or &quot;self-defense&quot;. Charges of felonious assault, conspiracy, murder, and conspiracy to commit civil rights abuse were filed against three officers. Charges of assault and conspiracy were also filed on a private security guard. All were found not guilty.

==Background==
===Riot===

The 12th Street Riot began in the early morning hours of Sunday, July 23, 1967. The Detroit Police Department at the time was 93% white, of whom 45% working in black neighborhoods were considered to be &quot;extremely anti-Negro&quot; and an additional 34% were &quot;prejudiced&quot;. The riot began after police raided a black-owned business that hosted a &quot;blind pig&quot; (illegal bar), during a party to celebrate the safe return of two black Vietnam War veterans. Police had expected a small number of patrons; however, there were 85 or more patrons inside. As the dozens of partygoers were being loaded into police vans, a mob of people formed around the scene. One of the sons of the blind pig&#x27;s owner jumped on the roof of a car and threw a bottle at the police, and the mob followed suit. In the ensuing violence, numerous businesses were looted or burnt down as the riot spread to other districts of Detroit. At first, police officers were ordered to hold back from responding to the rioting, to prevent an escalation in violence. A curfew was imposed and many people in Detroit stayed home or took shelter. Detroit Fire Department (DFD) personnel were held back from the fires by looters throwing objects at them or by snipers. Michigan Army National Guardsmen were activated by the Michigan government and were patrolling the streets and guarding several large businesses. Michigan State Troopers and United States Army paratroopers were also deployed to patrol the streets.

===Algiers Motel===
The Algiers Motel at 8301 Woodward Avenue near the Virginia Park district was a black-owned business, owned by Sam Gant and McUrant Pye. It was one of three motels in Detroit owned by Gant and Pye, the others being the Alamo, at Alfred and Woodward, and the Rio Grande, on West Grand near Grand River. Prior to Gant and Pye&#x27;s purchase in 1965, the motel&#x27;s white owner had barred black people from staying at the motel. The Algiers was considered by the police to be a center of illegal drugs and prostitution and was raided regularly by the vice squad. It was located close to the then-headquarters of General Motors (GM) and executives of the firm were regular customers. To the rear of the motel, a three-story detached home, known as the Manor House or Annex, was also rented to clients. Its street address was 50 Virginia Park Street, and it was accessible from Virginia Park and through a driveway from Woodward. The motel itself was laid out in the shape of a &quot;U&quot;, with its office, pool and cabana rooms to the left and a two-story wing of rooms to the right around its parking lot. The Manor House could be seen from Woodward Avenue.

===Motel guests===

After the riot started, the Dramatics singing group left a concert on Saturday, July 22 and they all checked in at the Algiers. Three of the members—Ron Banks, Larry Demps and Michael Calhoun—left before the 25th, leaving Roderick Davis, Larry Reed and the band&#x27;s valet Fred Temple at the motel. On the evening of July 25, the Motel Annex was occupied by several people who had taken refuge from the rioting:
* Michael Clark, 21, black male, a survivor 
* Carl Cooper, 17, black male, killed by gunshot
* Roderick Davis, 21, black male, member of The Dramatics, a survivor
* Lee Forsythe, 20, black male, a survivor
* Robert Lee Greene, 26, black male, Vietnam War veteran, a survivor
* Juli Ann Hysell, 18, white female, a survivor
* Karen Malloy, 18, white female, a survivor
* Charles Moore, early 40s, black male, a survivor
* Aubrey Pollard, 19, black male, killed by gunshot
* Larry Reed, 19, black male, singer and member of The Dramatics, a survivor
* James Sortor, 18, black male, a survivor
* Fred Temple, 18, black male, valet to The Dramatics, killed by gunshot

==Incident==

===Shooting of the motel===
On July 25, 1967, police and National Guardsmen were protecting the Great Lakes Mutual Life Insurance building one block north. Security guard Melvin Dismukes was guarding a store across the street from the Algiers. After midnight, shots were heard and Guardsman Ted Thomas reported gunfire in the vicinity of the Algiers Motel. A large contingent of Detroit police officers, State Troopers, and Guardsmen were ordered to investigate. They observed people in the windows of the Algiers&#x27; annex building, and consequently shot out those windows and stormed the building through its three entrances.

According to testimony, three of the black youths—Cooper, Clark, and Forsythe—and the two white women, Hysell and Malloy, were listening to music in a third-floor room of the annex. Cooper pulled out a starter pistol and shot blanks in the air, drawing return fire from the various authorities outside. Alarmed and frightened, the occupants fled to other rooms as law enforcement personnel rushed into the annex.

===Death of Carl Cooper===
Carl Cooper was the first youth shot to death in the incident. Cooper had been in a third-floor room but his dead body was found in a first-floor room, A-2. He was killed by law enforcement personnel when they first entered the building: according to later testimony, he may have been mistaken for an armed rioter. Alternatively, several law enforcement witnesses later testified that Cooper was already dead when they entered the building. The shooting was never fully explained and no one was ever arrested for Cooper&#x27;s death.

His injuries were consistent with buckshot wounds from the type of shotguns the Detroit Police Department used. In their testimony about the entering of the annex, Guardsmen, State Troopers and Detroit police officers each testified they were not the first to enter, stating that Cooper was already dead when they arrived, leaving responsibility for the death unexplained. In the federal conspiracy trial, the defense would attempt to show that Cooper was killed by occupants of the motel before the police arrived but this was denied by those occupants. They testified that at least one policeman shot into the rooms first and checked for persons later.

===Abuse of motel guests===
The occupants of the motel annex were rounded up in the first-floor hallway and lined up against the wall. The various officers present hit each of the persons in turn, threatening to kill them unless they told the officers who had the gun and was sniping from the motel. Two 18-year-old women, Juli Hysell and Karen Malloy, were both forcibly stripped naked and harangued as &quot;nigger lovers&quot;. Several of the men were shown a knife on the floor and told to pick it up, so they could be killed in &quot;self-defense&quot;. In turn, each of the black youths in line were taken into rooms and intimidated with threats or gunshots and told to stay still and quiet or be killed. The policeman who had escorted the occupant then returned to the hallway, making some comment about the death of the individual. First, per conflicting reports, an officer took one of the youths into a room and fired a shot into the wall, to make the prisoners believe he was dead in a simulated execution. He then asked Guardsman Ted Thomas if he wanted to kill one. Thomas then took an occupant into a room and shot into the ceiling. Auburey Pollard was then taken to room A-3 by Officer Ronald August. August would later admit to Pollard&#x27;s killing, stating it was in self-defense. A spent cartridge found next to Pollard was a .300 Savage, a type used for sporting rifles and not issued to police officers. Pollard had extensive injuries to his head. Witnesses described how he had been beaten on the head with a rifle, with force enough to break the rifle. The remaining occupants then admitted that Cooper had a starter pistol and had used it earlier.

The sound of gunshots was then heard outside the motel and the police officers left. Two remaining officers escorted the remaining prisoners out of the motel annex and told them to run home or they would be killed too. The death of the third youth, Fred Temple, occurred at that time or later. Several of the prisoners who were allowed to leave recalled Temple still being alive when they left the motel. Temple&#x27;s body was later found in room A-3. He had been shot by Officer Robert Paille, who later testified it was in self-defense during a struggle over his gun.

==Aftermath==
===Discovery of corpses===
The officers did not report the deaths to the Detroit Police Homicide Bureau as required. The next day, on July 26, 1967, Charles Hendrix, whose security firm provided security for the Algiers, found the bodies in the annex and reported the deaths to the Wayne County Morgue, which then called the Detroit Police Homicide Bureau. Detectives Edward Hay, Lyle Thayer, a photographer and several patrolmen arrived around 3 a.m. The scene was examined and the bodies removed. A knife was found next to the body in A-2, but no gun was found and the cartridges and shell casings were left. The investigator&#x27;s activities, including the flashes from the camera and the presence of police on the roof of the building, were noticed by Guardsmen stationed nearby and they shouted a challenge to identify themselves. The detectives left the scene to return at a later time, feeling it was not safe to stay on scene that night.

===Press reports===
The deaths were reported to the press as having happened in an exchange of gunfire with snipers. However, the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; interviewed the witnesses of the events, who all claimed to have been unarmed and that the dead men were not snipers. The deaths were reported to Congressman John Conyers and the NAACP and motel witnesses appeared in a press conference held by Conyers on the conduct of the military and police. The US Department of Justice began an investigation under assistant District Attorney Robert Murphy, who interviewed witnesses. The witnesses&#x27; accounts were delivered to Detroit prosecutors on July 29. The &quot;Free Press&quot; investigated the story and retained a pathologist, Dr. Robert Sillery, to examine the bodies. His conclusions were that all three had been killed inside the home and all had been shot twice, shot from slightly behind and at close range, and in defensive postures.

Five days after the incident, &quot;The Detroit News&quot; reported the story of one of the survivors, Robert Lee Greene, stating that one of the National Guard warrant officers murdered the men.

===Charge of Melvin Dismukes===
Security guard Melvin Dismukes, who was black, was the first to be charged. He was arraigned for the felonious assault of James Sortor and Michael Clark in the first-floor hallway of the annex. He was freed on $1,500 bail. Dismukes&#x27;s trial took place in May 1968. He was found not guilty of the charge of felonious assault. The all-white jury returned the verdict in 13 minutes.

===Investigations===
Officer Ronald August, Officer Robert Paille, and Officer David Senak, confessed to taking part in the killings of Pollard and Temple and were charged with murder. Each spent one night in jail and was released on $5,000 bail. August had given a statement to detectives that the three were dead when he arrived, but asked for that statement back and submitted a second statement asserting he had shot Pollard in self-defense. At the pretrial examination, Guard Warrant Officer Ted Thomas identified August as the shooter of Pollard and 23-year-old Vice Patrolman David Senak as the officer who did the questioning and beating. Senak had allegedly taken part in the killing of two men earlier in the riot before arriving at the Algiers Motel. Paille&#x27;s initial confession was ruled inadmissible and August claimed self-defense. Senak appeared as a witness and testified that he had not seen August or Paille fire their weapons. One of the motel survivors, Michael Clark, gave conflicting evidence that August and Paille had taken him into a room and threatened him when Hersey falsely wrote Senak and Thomas had actually done so. Judge DeMascio ruled that August could be indicted for the murder of Pollard, but charges against Paille for the murder of Temple were dropped.

===Protest tribunal===
The Citywide Citizens&#x27; Action Committee, organized by Dan Aldridge, was formed by a coalition of Detroit black leaders. They held a tribunal of their own, convicting August, Paille, Dismukes and Thomas for their roles in the murders and sentencing them to death. The jury included novelist John Killens and activist Rosa Parks. Without revealing himself, Dismukes attended the tribunal.

===Arrest of Robert Paille and David Senak===
On August 23, Ronald August, Robert Paille and David Senak were arrested for conspiracy under Michigan law. The conspiracy trial began on September 27 in Recorder&#x27;s Court. The trial was three days in length. Judge Frank Schemanske dismissed the conspiracy charges in December. Schemanske concluded that while there was &quot;unfortunate violence&quot; at the motel, it was &quot;scarcely surprising&quot; but also &quot;overzealous&quot;. He also stated that &quot;[the witnesses] in their calculated prevarication to the point of perjury was so blatant as to defeat its object.&quot; The decision was appealed to the Michigan Supreme Court but that was later dismissed.

===Trial of Robert Paille===
The dismissal of the murder charge against Paille by Judge DeMascio during the pre-trial was appealed by Prosecutor William L. Cahalan. Recorder&#x27;s Court Judge Geraldine Ford ordered the case back to Judge DeMascio for further testimony. Paille&#x27;s attorney Norman Lippitt then appealed to the Michigan Court of Appeals, which chose not to hear the case. Lippitt then appealed to the Michigan Supreme Court. In 1970, the Supreme Court ruled that the Wayne County Court of Appeals should determine whether the case could be reopened. In 1971, the Wayne County Court ordered the Recorder&#x27;s Court to take additional testimony.

The final appeal would be heard in February 1972. Judge George Ryan of Detroit Recorder&#x27;s Court would dismiss the murder charge in August 1972, stating that Paille&#x27;s confession was inadmissible because he had not been advised of his Constitutional rights as per the 1966 Miranda Warning law. He cited the testimony of Detroit detective Charles Schlacter, who stated that he &quot;viewed both August and Paille&quot; as suspects when he took the statements. Schlacter stated that if he had informed them of their rights, they would not have confessed. In Ryan&#x27;s judgment, the law meant that persons must be advised of their right to remain silent in what was an &quot;atmosphere of coercion.&quot;

===Trial of Ronald August===
The first-degree murder trial of Ronald August was held in May and June 1969 in Mason, Michigan. It had been moved from Detroit to escape publicity, partly because of a 1968 book on the incident. In opening statements, defense attorney Norman Lippitt described Pollard as &quot;an antisocial personality&quot; and &quot;potential killer&quot; and the killing by August as &quot;justifiable homicide&quot; while prosecutor Avery Weiswasser described the killing as &quot;murder with malice aforethought and with full premeditation.&quot;

August admitted killing Pollard, describing it as &quot;justifiable homicide&quot; because Pollard had attempted to grab his shotgun. According to &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; reporter Walker Lundy, there were as many descriptions of the shooting as there were witnesses. Two State&#x27;s witnesses, Greene and Hysell, who had been at the motel, failed to appear to testify.

Guardsman Thomas took one of the youths into a room and fired a shot into the ceiling. Senak then gave August a shotgun and told August to &quot;shoot one&quot;. Thomas stated that he heard no sounds of struggle or words between August and Pollard before he saw &quot;a flash of clothing, heard a shotgun blast and saw Pollard&#x27;s body fall&quot;. Thomas then told an officer either &quot;this was police business&quot; or &quot;this was bad business&quot; and &quot;he was leaving&quot;. According to Thomas, August said no words throughout the incident.

Karen Malloy, one of the two women in the motel, testified that she saw Cooper shoot a starter&#x27;s pistol at another black youth in a room on the third floor of the motel. The police then shot out the window of the room and the occupants fled. She ran to the room of Robert Greene and hid there until a police officer with a rifle arrived. The officer fired into the closet and a bathroom. Then, he asked if there was anyone in either place. They were all herded into the first floor hallway, where she said several of the black youths were beaten and taken individually into motel rooms. She testified she was not beaten but she had been forcibly stripped naked. She testified that she could not identify August as one of the officers and that she had not seen any of the killings.

State Troopers Philip Martin, John Fonger and Archie Davies testified at the trial. All testified to the lineup and beatings going on and officers taking individuals from the line into motel rooms and shooting their guns in a &quot;game&quot; to frighten the prisoners. Davies and Fonger testified that they heard shots and then a man in blue shirt and riot helmet leave room A-3, ejecting empty shells from a revolver, stating &quot;that one tried for my gun&quot; and &quot;the room is secure&quot;. Martin testified that he saw no resistance, no sniper weapons and no arrests made while at the motel. After Fonger reported the events to his supervisor, the supervisor stated that it was &quot;in the hands of the Detroit Police and he didn&#x27;t like what was going on&quot; and the Troopers left.

On June 3, August testified in his own defense. He stated that he saw the bodies of Cooper and Temple when he entered the building, and saw a lineup against the wall. He testified that, when asked by Senak, he took Pollard into room A-3 and closed the door. There, Pollard asked if he was going to shoot him. August said he would not and he had never shot anyone. He asked Pollard if he knew anything about a sniper and Pollard said he did not. August testified that Pollard then pushed August&#x27;s shotgun away and then grabbed the gun. August stated then he tried to fire the gun, but the safety was on. Pollard then came at him and he fired, killing Pollard. He testified: &quot;I thought he was going to take the gun away from me. He scared me.&quot; August testified that he did not file a report immediately after the shooting, as required, on the advice of either Paille or Senak. When August arrived at the station the next day, he found out that no one else had filed a report. Paille was the only one with a radio and was supposed to have called for an ambulance and squad car. He testified that he, Senak and Paille filed a joint report. Two days later, they were summoned to the station to file individual statements. August admitted lying in his statement to his supervisor, then asking for the statement back to change it, to admit he had taken part in the shootings and had done so in self-defense.

The trial concluded on June 9 with summations by prosecutor Avery Weisswasser and defense attorney Norman Lippitt. Judge William Beer instructed the all-white jury to either convict August of first-degree murder or acquit him. They could not return a verdict of the lesser charges of second-degree murder or manslaughter, as both the defense and the prosecution had requested. According to the &quot;Free Press&quot;, legal sources described Beer&#x27;s instructions to the jury as a direction to find an acquittal on the other possible options. Beer&#x27;s instructions to the jury were criticized by black leaders as &quot;having all but guaranteed an acquittal&quot; for August. After deliberating for 2 ½ hours, the jury found August not guilty.

===Federal conspiracy trial===
The earlier Schemanske decision incensed Kenneth McIntyre, the assistant U.S. District Attorney, and he pushed to reopen a federal investigation of the killings. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigated the case. J. Edgar Hoover personally reviewed the policemen&#x27;s statements, and described them as &quot;for the most part untrue and were undoubtedly furnished in an attempt to cover their activities and the true series of events.&quot; On May 3, 1968, a federal grand jury indicted Melvin Dismukes, Ronald August, Robert Paille and David Senak on a charge of conspiring to deny civil rights to the motel occupants. An indictment was not pursued against Thomas because the government wanted his testimony against the others. The federal conspiracy trial was delayed, both by the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, but also the publication of a book by John Hersey, &quot;The Algiers Motel Incident.&quot; U.S. Judge Stephen Roth was assigned the case. The defense asked for a change of venue. Roth closed the hearings to the press and waited a full year until September 1969 before ruling on the change of venue, ordering the trial to be moved to his hometown of Flint, Michigan.

In January and February 1970, the federal conspiracy trial was held in Flint, Michigan. It, like the August murder trial, had been moved from Detroit partially because of the publication of &quot;The Algiers Motel Incident.&quot; It meant it was nearly impossible to get any black persons on the jury. Defense lawyer Lippitt represented the policemen and admitted later that he felt the book publishing had helped his case as he felt that no black person in Detroit would be impartial. &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t want a black man on the jury. I was hoping for all the prejudice I could get.&quot;

The other woman held prisoner at the motel, Juli Hysell, testified at the trial. She testified about the starter pistol incident and the lineup in the hallway, but could not identify any of the defendants as being present at the motel. James Sortor, another of the black youths held at the motel, did identify the defendants August, Paille and Dismukes as being present at the motel, but he testified that he had not heard any shooting inside the motel. He stated that he &quot;was beaten so many times he lost count.&quot; Roderick Davis testified that he had heard the shots and the sounds of people running on the stairs. Both Hysell and Sortor testified that Cooper was still alive when the police arrived.

Senak&#x27;s lawyer stated that Temple was shot while being handcuffed after Temple grabbed Senak&#x27;s service revolver. State Trooper Hubert Rosema testified that he heard scuffling noises and gunshots coming from the room. Senak was overheard to yell &quot;He&#x27;s got my gun&quot; multiple times. He testified that afterwards, he went into the room and saw Temple still breathing, lying against the bed. No aid was called for Temple as far as he knew.

Several witnesses were called to support the charge of a cover-up by August, Paille and Senak to save face. Police Lieutenant Robert Boroni testified about the contents of the July 29 first report the three policemen filed stating that they entered the motel, saw the lineup, saw that the prisoners were already wounded and left. August&#x27;s July 31 statement stated that he did not fire his gun inside the motel, and he saw no Guardsmen on the premises. Detroit homicide detective Robert Everett testified that August filed a separate statement two hours later that he had shot Pollard in self-defense and that Paille admitted shooting Temple. Police Lieutenant Gerald Hallmark provided a statement that later that day August and Paille asked to revise their statements. According to Hallmark, August said &quot;the media have the events all wrong and that he did what he had to do.&quot;

After deliberating for nine hours, an all-white jury found the four not guilty of conspiracy. In a review of the trial, the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; felt that prosecutors Avery Weiswasser and McIntyre were &quot;outpointed by Lippitt.&quot;

===John Hersey book===

In 1968, writer John Hersey wrote a book about the incident. Hersey interviewed survivors, members of the victims&#x27; families and some of the law enforcement personnel who participated in the raid and also consulted forensic reports, in identifying the law enforcement personnel involved in the killings. The proceeds from royalties from the book (over 550,000 copies were printed) were turned over to a college scholarship fund for African American students by Knopf. Hersey stated in the book that he &quot;will not take any money from any source for the publication of this story&quot;.

==Legacy==
===Lives of police officers===
The Detroit Police Department rehired Ronald August and David Senak in 1971, after firing them in the aftermath of the Algiers Motel killings. The DPD refused to rehire Robert Paille, citing the false statements he made in his initial incident report. Paille took other jobs including crane operator, construction worker, carpenter and insurance agent. Senak opened a construction business. Dismukes became a security guard for the Detroit Pistons. He received death threats from the Black Panthers. August resigned from the Detroit Police in July 1977. He became a building tradesman. August, Paille and Senak all moved out of Detroit.

===Lippitt===
Norman Lippitt later became an Oakland County Circuit Judge in 1985, then returned to private practice in 1987 in Birmingham, Michigan. Lippitt died on July 26, 2021.

===Algiers Motel===
In 1968, Cahalan filed suit to close down the Algiers Motel but was unsuccessful. It re-opened as &quot;The Desert Inn&quot;. The motel and manor house were demolished in 1979. This was done as part of the &quot;New Center&quot; urban renewal project sponsored in part by General Motors. The Motel was located at 8301 Woodward Avenue, between Woodward and Virginia Park in the geographic center of Detroit. The site where the motel and the manor house stood is now an open greenspace known as Virginia Park.

===Lawsuits===
Both the Pollard family and the Temple family filed lawsuits against the Detroit Police officers. Settlements were reached in each case. In 1976, the City of Detroit paid each family $62,500 ($ today) to settle.

===Life of Larry Reed===
Larry Reed left The Dramatics after the incident, and today sings in church choirs.

==Historical marker==
In July 2024, a historical marker went up at the site.

==In popular culture==
In 2013, Mercilee Jenkins&#x27; play &quot;Spirit of Detroit&quot; was performed at the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History. The play is centered on the stories of Anthony, a black man, and Lucy, a white woman who were friends in childhood and reunited during the 1967 riot, at the Algiers Motel hiding out from the violence.

In 2017, Annapurna Pictures released &quot;Detroit&quot;, a feature film dramatization of the 12th Street Riot and the Algiers Motel incident, directed by Kathryn Bigelow. Hysell acted as a special advisor on the film and was present every day on the set. The movie soundtrack includes a singing performance by Algee Smith of Larry Reed&#x27;s song &quot;Grow&quot;.

<text>In computing, a magic cookie, or just cookie for short, is a token or short packet of data passed between communicating programs. The cookie is often used to identify a particular event or as &quot;handle, transaction ID, or other token of agreement between cooperating programs&quot;. 

== Usage ==

Cookie data is typically not meaningful to the recipient program. The contents are opaque and not usually interpreted until the recipient passes the cookie data back to the sender or perhaps another program at a later time.

In some cases, recipient programs are able to meaningfully compare two cookies for equality.

The cookie can be used like a ticket.

== Early use ==
The term &quot;magic cookie&quot; appears in the man page for the fseek routine in the C standard library, dating back at least to 1979, where it was stated:
* &quot;&quot;ftell&quot; returns the current value of the offset relative to the beginning of the file associated with the named &quot;stream&quot;. It is measured in bytes on UNIX; on some other systems it is a magic cookie, and the only foolproof way to obtain an &quot;offset&quot; for &quot;fseek&quot;.&quot;

== Cookie as token ==
An analogy is the token supplied at a coat check (cloakroom) counter in real life. The token has no intrinsic meaning, but its uniqueness allows it to be exchanged for the correct coat when returned to the coat check counter. The coat check token is opaque because the way in which the counter staff are able to find the correct coat when the token is presented is immaterial to the person who wishes their coat returned. In other cases (as is possible with HTTP cookies), the actual data of interest can be stored as name–value pairs directly on the cookie.

Cookies are used as identifying tokens in many computer applications. When one visits a website, the remote server may leave an HTTP cookie on one&#x27;s computer, where they are often used to authenticate identity upon returning to the website.

Cookies are a component of the most common authentication method used by the X Window System.

<text>The French 75 mm field gun is a quick-firing field artillery piece adopted in March 1898. Its official French designation was: Matériel de 75 mm Mle 1897. It was commonly known as the French 75, simply the 75 and Soixante-Quinze (French for &quot;seventy-five&quot;). The French 75 was designed as an anti-personnel weapon system for delivering large volumes of time-fused shrapnel shells on enemy troops advancing in the open. After 1915 and the onset of trench warfare, impact-detonated high-explosive shells prevailed. By 1918 the 75s became the main agents of delivery for toxic gas shells. The 75s also became widely used as truck mounted anti-aircraft artillery. They were the main armament of the Saint-Chamond tank in 1918 and the 
Char 2c.

The French 75 is widely regarded as the first modern artillery piece. It was the first field gun to include a hydro-pneumatic recoil mechanism, which kept the gun&#x27;s trail and wheels perfectly still during the firing sequence. Since it did not need to be re-aimed after each shot, the crew could reload and fire as soon as the barrel returned to its resting position. In typical use the French 75 could deliver fifteen rounds per minute on its target, either shrapnel or melinite high-explosive, up to about away. Its firing rate could even reach close to 30 rounds per minute, albeit only for a very short time and with a highly experienced crew.

At the opening of World War I, in 1914, the French Army had about 4,000 of these field guns in service. By the end of the war about 12,000 had been produced. It was also in service with the American Expeditionary Forces, which had been supplied with about 2,000 French 75 field guns. Several thousand were still in use in the French Army at the opening of World War II, updated with new wheels and tires to allow towing by trucks rather than by horses. The French 75 set the pattern for almost all early-20th century field pieces, with guns of mostly 75 mm forming the basis of many field artillery units into the early stages of World War II.

== Development ==
The forerunner of the French 75 was an experimental 57 mm gun which was first assembled in September 1891 at the Bourges arsenal under the direction of Captain Sainte-Claire Deville. This 57 mm gun took advantage of a number of the most advanced artillery technologies available at the time:
# Vieille&#x27;s smokeless powder, which was introduced in 1884.
# Self-contained ammunition, with the powder charge in a brass case which also held the shell.
# An early hydro-pneumatic short recoil mechanism that was designed by Major Louis Baquet.
# A rotating screw breech built under license from Thorsten Nordenfelt.

The only major design difference between the 57 and 75 that would emerge was the recoil system. But even before the 57 entered testing, in 1890 General Mathieu, Director of Artillery at the Ministry of War, had been informed that Konrad Haussner, a German engineer working at the Ingolstadt arsenal, had patented an oil-and-compressed-air long-recoil system. They also learned that Krupp was considering introducing the system after testing it. Krupp would later reject Haussner&#x27;s invention, due to insoluble technical problems caused by hydraulic fluid leakage.

In 1891 Haussner sold his patents to a firm named Gruson, which searched for potential buyers. After reviewing the blueprints in February 1892, the French artillery engineers advised that a gun should be produced without purchasing the Haussner invention. Accordingly, General Mathieu turned to Lt. Colonel Joseph-Albert Deport, at the time the Director of the Atelier de Construction de Puteaux (APX), and asked him whether he could construct a gun on the general principle of the Haussner long-cylinder recoil without infringing the existing patents. After it was judged possible, a formal request was sent out on 13 July 1892.

It took five more years under the overall leadership of Mathieu&#x27;s successor, General Deloye, to perfect and finally adopt in March 1898 an improved and final version of the Deport 75 mm long-recoil field gun. Various deceptions, some of them linked to the Dreyfus Case which erupted in 1894, had been implemented by Deloye and French counter-intelligence to distract German espionage.

The final experimental version of Deport&#x27;s 75 mm field gun was tested during the summer of 1894 and judged very promising. Extensive trials, however, revealed that it was still prone to hydraulic fluid leakage from the long-recoil mechanism. The Deport 75 was returned to Puteaux arsenal for further improvements. Hydraulic fluid leakage was typical of this experimental phase of artillery development during the 1890s, as Haussner and Krupp had previously experienced.

In December 1894, Deport was passed over for promotion, and resigned to join &quot;Chatillon-Commentry&quot;, a private armaments firm. Two young military engineers from Ecole Polytechnique, Captains Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville and Emile Rimailho, continued development and introduced an improved version in 1896. Their contribution was a leakproof hydro-pneumatic long-recoil mechanism which they named &quot;Frein II&quot; (Brake # II). A major improvement was the placement of improved silver-alloy rings on the freely moving piston which separated the compressed air and the hydraulic fluid inside the main hydro-pneumatic recoil cylinder. These and other modifications achieved the desired result: the long-term retention of hydraulic fluid and compressed air inside the recoil system, even under the worst field conditions.

Captain Sainte-Claire Deville also designed important additional features, such as a device for piercing the fuzes of shrapnel shells automatically during the firing sequence (an &quot;automatic fuze-setter&quot;), thus selecting the desired bursting distance. The independent sight had also been perfected for easy field use by the crews, and a nickel-steel shield was added to protect the gunners. The armored caissons were designed to be tilted in order to present the shells horizontally to the crews. The wheel brakes could be swung under each wheel (&quot;abattage&quot;), and, together with the trail spade, they immobilized the gun during firing.

The gun was officially adopted on 28 March 1898 under the name &quot;&quot;Matériel de&quot; 75 mm &quot;Mle 1&quot;897&quot;. The public saw it for the first time during the Bastille Day parade of 14 July 1899.

=== Hydro-pneumatic recoil mechanism ===
The gun&#x27;s barrel slid back on rollers, including a set at the muzzle, when the shot was fired. The barrel was attached near the breech to a piston rod extending into an oil-filled cylinder placed just underneath the gun. When the barrel recoiled, the piston was pulled back by the barrel&#x27;s recoil and thus pushed the oil through a small orifice and into a second cylinder placed underneath. That second cylinder contained a freely floating piston which separated the surging oil from a confined volume of compressed air. During the barrel&#x27;s recoil the floating piston was forced forward by the oil, compressing the air even further. This action absorbed the recoil progressively as the internal air pressure rose and, at the end of recoil, generated a strong but decreasing back pressure that returned the gun forward to its original position. The smoothness of this system had no equal in 1897, and for at least another ten years. Each recoil cycle on the French 75, including the return forward, lasted about two seconds, permitting a maximum theoretical firing rate of about 30 rounds per minute.

=== Ammunition ===
At the beginning in 1914, the French 75 fired two main types of shells, both with high muzzle velocities (535 m/s for the shrapnel shell) and a maximum range of 8,500 metres. Their relatively flat trajectories extended all the way to the designated targets. French 75 shells, at least initially in 1914, were essentially anti-personnel. They had been designed for the specific purpose of inflicting maximum casualties on enemy troops stationing or advancing in the open.

* A impact-detonated, thin-walled steel, high-explosive (HE) shell with a time-delay fuze. It was filled with picric acid, known in France as &quot;Melinite&quot;, used since 1888. The delay lasted five hundredths of a second, designed to detonate the shell in the air and at a man&#x27;s height after bouncing forward off the ground. These shells were particularly destructive to men&#x27;s lungs when exploding in their proximity.
* A time-fused shrapnel shell containing 290 lead balls. The balls shot forward when the fuse&#x27;s timer reached zero, ideally bursting high above the ground and enemy troops. During 1914 and 1915, the shrapnel shell was the dominant type of ammunition found in the French 75 batteries. However, by 1918, high-explosive shells had become virtually the sole type of 75 mm ammunition remaining in service.

Several new shells and fuses were introduced due to the demands of trench warfare. In 1918, a boat-tailed shell (with a superior ballistic coefficient) which could reach was deployed for use during the latter part of the war. Developed through French artillery research, it increased the effective range of the French 75 by about thirty-eight percent.

Every shell, whether it be a high-explosive or shrapnel shell, was fixed to a brass case which was ejected when the breech was manually opened. Semi-automatic breech opening and shell ejection during recoil and return had not been developed yet.

=== Rapid fire capability ===

The French 75 introduced a new concept in artillery technology: rapid firing without realigning the gun after each shot. Older artillery had to be resighted after each shot in order to stay on target, and thus fired no more than two aimed shots per minute. The French 75 easily delivered fifteen aimed rounds per minute and could fire even faster for short periods of time, but the long-term sustained rate was 3-4 rounds per minute as more than this would overheat the barrel. This rate of fire, the gun&#x27;s accuracy, and the lethality of the ammunition against personnel, made the French 75 superior to all other regimental field artillery at the time. When made ready for action, the first shot buried the trail spade and the two wheel anchors into the ground, following which all other shots were fired from a stable platform. Bringing down the wheel anchors tied to the braking system was called &quot;&quot;abattage&quot;. The gun could not be elevated beyond eighteen degrees, unless the trail spade had been deeply dug into the ground; however, the 75 mm field gun was not designed for plunging fire. The gun could be traversed laterally 3 degrees to the sides by sliding the trail on the wheel&#x27;s axle. Progressive traversing together with small changes in elevation could be carried out while continuously firing, called &quot;fauchage&quot;&quot; or &quot;sweeping fire&quot;. A four-gun battery firing shrapnel could deliver 17,000 ball projectiles over an area 100 metres wide by 400 metres long in a single minute, with devastating results. Because of the gun&#x27;s traversing ability, the greater the distance to the enemy concentration, the wider the area that could be swept.

== World War I service ==
Each Mle 1897 75 mm field gun battery of 4 guns consisted of 170 men led by four officers recruited among graduates of engineering schools. Enlisted men from the countryside were given charge of the six horses that pulled each gun and its first limber. Another six horses pulled each additional limber and caisson which were assigned to each gun. A battery included 160 horses, most of them pulling ammunition as well as repair and supply caissons.

The French artillery entered the war in August 1914 with more than 4,000 Mle 1897 75 mm field guns (1,000 batteries of four guns each). Over 17,500 Mle 1897 75 mm field guns were produced during World War I, over and above the 4,100 French 75s which were already deployed by the French Army in August 1914. All the essential parts, including the gun&#x27;s barrel and the oleo-pneumatic recoil mechanisms were manufactured by French State arsenals: Puteaux, Bourges, Châtellerault and St Etienne. A truck-mounted anti-aircraft version of the French 75 was assembled by the automobile firm of De Dion-Bouton and adopted in 1913.

The total production of 75 mm shells during World War I exceeded 200 million rounds, mostly by private industry. In order to increase shell production from 20,000 rounds per day to 100,000 in 1915, the government turned to civilian contractors, and, as a result, shell quality deteriorated. This led to an epidemic of burst barrels which afflicted 75 mm artillery during 1915. Colonel Sainte-Claire Deville corrected the problem, which was due to microfissures in the bases of the shells, due to shortcuts in manufacturing. Shell quality was restored by September 1915, but never to the full exacting standards of pre-war manufacture.

The French 75 gave its best performances during the Battle of the Marne in August–September 1914 and at Verdun in 1916. At the time the contribution of 75 mm artillery to these military successes, and thus to the French victories that ensued, was seen as significant. In the case of Verdun, over 1,000 French 75s (250 batteries) were constantly in action, night and day, on the battlefield during a period of nearly nine months. The total consumption of 75 mm shells at Verdun during the period February 21 to September 30, 1916, is documented by the public record at the &quot;Service Historique de l&#x27;Armée de Terre&quot; to have been in excess of 16 million rounds, or nearly 70% of all shells fired by French artillery during that battle. The French 75 was a devastating anti-personnel weapon against waves of infantry attacking in the open, as at the Marne and Verdun. However, its shells were comparatively light and lacked the power to obliterate trench works, concrete bunkers and deeply buried shelters. Thus, with time, the French 75 batteries became routinely used to cut corridors with high-explosive shells, across the belts of German barbed wire. After 1916, the 75 batteries became the carriers of choice to deliver toxic gas shells, including mustard gas and phosgene.

The French Army had to wait until early 1917 to receive in numbers fast-firing heavy artillery equipped with hydraulic recoil brakes (e.g. the 155 mm Schneider howitzer and the long-range Canon de 155 mm GPF). In the meantime it had to do with a total of about four thousand de Bange 90 mm, 120 mm and 155 mm field and converted fortress guns, all without recoil brakes, that were effective but inferior in rate of fire to the more modern German heavy artillery.

== Interwar service ==

During the interwar, the French army kept the Mle 1897 in service and it continued to be the main gun of the French field artillery. The surplus guns were soon sold to allied countries.

Upgrades were considered in the 1920s, such as the use of a split trail carriages. The prototypes were satisfactory but the French Army decided not to fund the improvements, choosing instead to develop a new model. That new plan was abandoned after the 1920s budget cuts.

However, a few Mle 1897 guns were modernized between the wars. The Rif War showed the vulnerability of the crew against snipers during guerilla operations. The &quot;roues métalliques DAG&quot;, solid metallic wheels, were developed in the late 1920s to offer more protection to the crew, although they were very noisy during movements. They were mostly sent to units serving in the North African colonies. From 1928, the French Army also adopted bogies to enable transport by motor vehicles, such as the Citroën-Kégresse P17. Mounted on the bogies, the guns could be towed at a maximum speed of 30 km/h on the road but the removal of the bogies was complicated.
A more modern version of the Mle 1897, the &quot;Canon de 75 Mle 1897/33&quot;, mounted the original barrel and recoil mechanism on a new split-trail carriage. In addition to the new carriage the Mle 1897/33 had a new gun shield, pneumatic tires, sprung suspension, and the wheels &quot;toed in&quot; when the trails were spread. The new carriage offered higher angles of traverse and elevation than the earlier box-trail carriage. However, the Mle 1897/33 was inferior to the new &quot;Canon de 105 C Mle 1935 B&quot; that used the same carriage, so it was only built in small numbers. A more modest upgrade to the Mle 1897 was the &quot;Canon de 75 Mle 1897/38&quot; which was a modernized field artillery variant. The original box-trail carriage was retained but the gun had a new gun shield, sprung suspension and pneumatic tires for motor transport. The 75 Mle 1897 was also considered as a possible anti-tank gun by the French Army, who in 1936 ordered a new circular platform, the &quot;plateforme Arbel Mle 1935&quot;. Mounted on that platform, the Mle 1897 gun could now quickly traverse to engage enemy tanks.

During this period a number of the guns entered Irish service, being sourced from Britain.

==World War II service==
Despite obsolescence brought on by new developments in artillery design, large numbers of 75s were still in use in 1939 (4,500 in the French Army alone), and they eventually found their way into a number of unlikely places. A substantial number had been delivered to Poland in 1919–20, together with infantry ordnance, in order to fight in the Polish-Soviet War. They were known as &quot;75 mm armata wz.1897&quot;. In 1939 the Polish army had 1,374 of these guns, making it by far the most numerous artillery piece in Polish service.

Many were captured by Germany during the Fall of France in 1940, in addition to Polish guns captured in 1939. Over 3,500 were modified with a muzzle brake and mounted on a 5 cm Pak 38 carriage, now named 7.5 cm Pak 97/38 they were used by the Wehrmacht in 1942 as an emergency weapon against the Soviet Union&#x27;s T-34 and KV tanks. Its relatively low velocity and a lack of modern armor-piercing ammunition limited its effectiveness as an anti-tank weapon. When the German 7.5 cm Pak 40 became available in sufficient numbers, most remaining Pak 97/38 pieces were returned to occupied France to reinforce the Atlantic Wall defenses or were supplied to Axis nations like Romania (PAK 97/38) and Hungary. Non-modified remainders were used as second-line and coastal artillery pieces under the German designation &quot;7.5 cm FK 231(f)&quot; and &quot;7,5 cm FK 97(p)&quot;. The few 60 Mle 1897/33s captured by the Germans were given the designation &quot;7.5 cm K232(f)&quot;.

== British service ==

In 1915 Britain acquired a number of &quot;autocanon de 75 mm mle 1913&quot; anti-aircraft guns, as a stopgap measure while it developed its own anti-aircraft alternatives. They were used in the defence of Britain, usually mounted on de Dion motor lorries using the French mounting which the British referred to as the &quot;Breech Trunnion&quot;. Britain also purchased a number of the standard 75 mm guns and adapted them for AA use using a Coventry Ordnance Works mounting, the &quot;Centre Trunnion&quot;. At the Armistice there were 29 guns in service in Britain.

In June 1940, with many British field guns lost in the Battle of France, 895 M1897 field guns and a million rounds of ammunition were purchased from the U.S. Army. For political purposes, the sale to the British Purchasing Commission was made through the US Steel Corporation. The basic, unmodified gun was known in British service as &quot;Ordnance, QF, 75 mm Mk 1&quot;, although many of the guns were issued to units on converted or updated mountings. They were operated by field artillery and anti-tank units. Some of the guns had their wheels and part of their carriages cut away so that they could be mounted on a pedestal called a &quot;Mounting, 75 mm Mk 1&quot;. These weapons were employed as light coastal artillery and were not declared obsolete until March 1945.

During World War II through Lend Lease, the British received 170 American half-track M3 gun motor carriage which mounted a 75 mm; they used these in Italy and Northern Europe until the end of the war as fire-support vehicles in armoured car regiments.

== Romanian service ==
Romania had a considerable number of World War I guns of 75 mm and 76.2 mm. Some models were modernized at Resita works in 1935 including French md. 1897. The upgrade was made with removable barrels. Several types of guns of close caliber were barreled to use the best ammunition available for 75 mm caliber, explosive projectile model 1917 &quot;Schneider&quot;. The new barrel was made of steel alloy with chrome and nickel with excellent mechanical resistance to pressure which allowed, after modifying the firing brake, the recovery arch and the sighting devices an increase of the range from 8.5 km to 11.2 km and a rate of fire of 20 rounds/minute. During World War 2 these guns also used Costinescu 75 mm anti-tank round. These upgraded field guns were used in all infantry divisions in World War II.

== U.S. service ==


The U.S. Army adopted the French 75 mm field gun during World War I and used it extensively in battle. The U.S. designation of the basic weapon was 75 mm Gun M1897. There were 480 American 75 mm field gun batteries (over 1,900 guns) on the battlefields of France in November 1918. Manufacture of the French 75 by American industry began in the spring of 1918 and quickly built up to an accelerated pace. Carriages were built by Willys-Overland, the hydro-pneumatic recuperators by Singer Manufacturing Company and Rock Island Arsenal, the cannon itself by Symington-Anderson and Wisconsin Gun Company. American industry built 1,050 French 75s during World War I, but only 143 had been shipped to France by 11 November 1918; most American batteries used French-built 75s in action.

The first U.S. artillery shots in action in World War I were fired by Battery C, 6th Field Artillery on October 23, 1917, with a French 75 named &quot;Bridget&quot; which is preserved today at the United States Army Ordnance Museum. During his service with the American Expeditionary Forces, Captain (and future U.S. President) Harry S. Truman commanded a battery of French 75s.

By the early 1930s, the only U.S. artillery units that remained horse-drawn were those assigned to infantry and cavalry divisions. During the 1930s, most M1897A2 and A3 (French made) and M1897A4 (American made) guns were subsequently modernized for towing behind trucks by mounting it on the modern carriage M2A3 which featured a split trail, pneumatic rubber tires allowing towing at any speed, an elevation limit increased to 45 degrees, and traverse increased to 30 degrees left and right. Along with new ammunition, these features increased the effective range and allowed the gun to be used as an anti-tank gun, in which form it equipped the first tank destroyer battalions.

In 1941, these guns began to become surplus when they were gradually being replaced by the M2A1 105 mm M101 split-trail Howitzer; some were removed from their towed carriages and installed on the M3 Half-Track as the M3 gun motor carriage (GMC) tank destroyers. However, equipment shortages led to the M1897s remaining in the inventory of U.S. Army units in the Philippine Islands as well as in artillery units of the Philippine Army as of December 1941, and they would be used in action against the Japanese before the Allied forces in the Philippines surrendered in May 1942. M3 GMCs were used in the Pacific theater during the Battle for the Philippines and by Marine Regimental Weapons Companies until 1944. The M3 GMC also formed the equipment of the early American tank destroyer battalions during operations in North Africa and Italy, and continued in use with the British in Italy and in small numbers in Northern Europe until the end of the war. Many others were used for training until 1942.

The 75 mm M2 and M3 tank guns of the M3 Lee and M4 Sherman Medium tanks, the 75 mm M6 tank gun of the M24 Chaffee light tank and the 75 mm gun of the -G and -H subtypes of the B-25 Mitchell bomber all used the same ammunition as the M1897. The 75 mm Pack Howitzer M1 used the same projectiles fired from a smaller 75×272R case.

== Contemporary usage ==
The Canon de 75 modèle 1897 is still used in France as a saluting gun. When the French Army discarded its 105 HM2 howitzers to replace them with MO-120-RT mortars, only 155 mm artillery pieces remained, for which no blank cartridges were available. The Army then recommissioned two Canon de 75 modèle 1897, then located at the Musée de l&#x27;Artillerie de Draguignan. They are used for State ceremonies.

The 75 was also innovatively used to mitigate avalanche risk at Alta Ski Area by Monty Atwater after returning from service in WWII. Using artillery and explosives then became the state of the art for avalanche mitigation, and Alta, as a world-renowned home of avalanche research, used this tool for 75 years until it was retired in favor of more modern, effective, and safe techniques after the 2023 ski season. It was notably the only place in the world in which live artillery was allowed to be shot over the heads of civilians, and may be the only place in which this gun was used for a purely peaceful purpose, and to save lives in place of taking them.
== Variants and derivatives ==

=== Naval and coastal artillery ===
The French Navy adopted the 75 mm modèle 1897 for its coastal batteries and warships

The 75 mm modèle 1897–1915 was placed on SMCA modèle 1925 mountings with a vertical elevation of -10 to +70° and a 360° rotation. This allowed it to be used in an anti-aircraft role.

New 75 mm guns were developed specifically for anti-aircraft use. The &#x27;75 mm modèle 1922&#x27;, &#x27;75 mm modèle 1924&#x27; and &#x27;75 mm modèle 1927&#x27; of 50 calibre were developed from the 62.5 calibre &#x27;75 mm Schneider modèle 1908&#x27; mounted on the Danton-class battleships.

<text>James R. M. Harris (born 12 February 1961) is a Canadian author, environmentalist, and politician. He was leader of the Green Party of Canada from 2003 to 2006, when he was succeeded by Elizabeth May.

==Early life and Green activism==
Harris was born in Toronto, attended Lakefield College School, and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in English and History from Queen&#x27;s University in Kingston in the 1980s. Initially a Progressive Conservative, he was converted to green politics in 1985 after reading &quot;Green Politics&quot; by Fritjof Capra and Charlene Spretnak, which highlights the rise of the German Greens. Harris worked as the national press officer of the British Green Party in 1987.

He helped organize the Ontario Green Party&#x27;s campaign in the 1990 provincial election, and was himself a candidate in the Toronto division of St. Andrew—St. Patrick. In this election, he spoke against a provincial government decision to build more nuclear reactors in the province. The Green Party fielded 40 candidates and received 33,000 votes, a significant increase from seven candidates and 3,000 votes in the previous 1987 election. Harris finished fourth in his constituency.

Harris campaigned for Mayor of Toronto in the 1991 municipal election, as an independent candidate supporting green policies. He called for water conservation and a ban on city pesticide spraying, and supported stricter gun control. Considered a fringe candidate, he finished well behind frontrunners June Rowlands and Jack Layton.

In 1993, Harris and other Ontario Greens sought and won a change in the party&#x27;s constitution allowing for the election of a full-time leader. The party had been nominally led by Katherine Mathewson in the 1990 election, but she held little influence over the campaign or policy. Harris and others argued that electing a full-time leader would allow the Green Party to organize professionally, and present a united message in future elections. Harris stood for the leadership, and lost to Frank de Jong. De Jong later supported Harris in his bid to become federal leader, while Harris endorsed de Jong&#x27;s bid for re-election as provincial leader in 2001.

Harris was a Toronto organizer for the federal Green Party for the 1993 election, recruiting seventeen candidates in the area. New legislation brought in before the election required a party to run 50 candidate or suffer de-registration and lose its assets. By fielding seventeen candidates in the Toronto region (which then had roughly twenty-two ridings) the Toronto team presented over one-third of the national requirement. Harris stood for election in St. Paul&#x27;s, and finished sixth.

Harris campaigned for leader of the Green Party of Canada in 1997, and finished second against Joan Russow. He was elected as the first president of the Green Party of Ontario in 2001, and served in that capacity until moving to the federal arena in 2003.

==Author and speaker==
Harris has written six books, two of which have been national best-sellers in Canada. He also delivers speeches on change and leadership in the corporate sector, and was forced to miss at least one campaign appearance in 2004 to fulfill a prior speaking engagement. Association Magazine has ranked him as one of Canada&#x27;s top speakers. He spoke at about fifty international conferences a year before becoming GPC leader, and conducts strategic planning sessions with executive teams on leadership, change, CRM, eLearning, innovation and creating learning organizations.

His second book, &quot;The Learning Paradox&quot;, was nominated for the National Business Book Award in Canada and appeared on several bestseller lists. In this work, Harris argues that Canadians should embrace new learning to gain usable skills for a business community grounded in rapid technological change. Books for Business ranked it as one of the top-10 business books in North America. Harris co-authored the second edition of &quot;The 100 Best Companies to Work for in Canada&quot;, which sold over 50,000 copies in Canada. A more recent book, &quot;Blindsided!&quot;, has been published in over 80 countries.

==National leader==
===2004 campaign===
Harris was elected leader of the Green Party of Canada on 14 February 2003, defeating Jason Crummey and John Grogan with over 81% of the votes cast by delegates. He replaced interim leader Chris Bradshaw, who led the party from 2001 to 2003. In his campaign for the leadership, Harris asked the membership to elect his preferred slate of council candidates. Other than leadership contestants, council candidates were not given the membership list to use in their campaign despite the green party constitution clearly offering them that right.

Harris attempted to shift the GPC away from an exclusively environmentalist message, and often described the party&#x27;s ideology as socially progressive and fiscally conservative and as the only party committed to sustainability. He has rejected the argument that voting for the Greens will elect Conservative candidates through vote-splitting, arguing that his party takes support from across the traditional political spectrum.

The party conducted a high-profile campaign in the 2004 election under Harris&#x27;s leadership, running candidates in all federal ridings for the first time in its history. The 2004 GPC platform, produced by wiki technology called LivingPlatform. As such the GPC was the first party worldwide to use a wiki—and an open process—to develop its platform. More than 60,000 people participated in the final selection of platform planks.

The Living Platform emphasized full cost accounting, the &quot;triple bottom line&quot; (social, financial, environmental) and the green tax shift. The party&#x27;s fiscal policy proposed taxing polluting activities and non-renewable resources more and incomes less on a revenue-neutral basis. The plan also proposed selective tax cuts on corporate income, which alienated some left-of-centre Greens.

Despite their increased profile, Greens were not invited to the leadership debates. Harris complained of a double standard, as the Bloc Québécois had been included despite not fielding candidates in all ridings. The CRTC defended the right of the broadcasters&#x27; consortium to decide on participants and refused to overturn the party&#x27;s exclusion.

On the eve of the 2004 election, Harris argued that as the NDP won nine seats with 6.9% of the vote in 1993, if the Greens would elect MPs if they could match or surpass that threshold. The party received 582,247 votes (4.3%), but failed to elect any candidates. Harris campaigned in Toronto—Danforth and finished fourth against New Democratic Party leader Jack Layton with 2,575 votes (5.4%) – 400 votes behind the Conservative candidate.

===Criticism and 2004 leadership challenge===
Harris&#x27;s leadership of the Green Party was controversial. He described himself as an ecological conservative and eco-capitalist, and attempted to shift the party to the right on some issues. Some party members criticized Harris in August 2004 for hiring David Scrymgeour, a former national director of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada and aide to Jim Flaherty, as an advisor. His opponents also accused him of shifting too much authority to the party leadership, while reducing the power of local associations.

Following the 2004 election, Harris was challenged for the leadership by Tom Manley, a prominent party activist from eastern Ontario. Manley argued that Harris was shifting the GPC too far to the right, and was abandoning the party&#x27;s traditional emphasis on local production in favour of greater accommodation with corporate interests. Harris won re-election as GPC leader in August 2004 on the first ballot count, though by a narrower margin than before. Manley was later appointed deputy leader, but left the GPC in 2005 to join the Liberals.

A number of prominent Greens tendered their resignations during Harris&#x27;s tenure as leader, with many accusing him of mismanaging the party.

Late in 2005, columnist Murray Dobbin wrote two articles accusing Harris of betraying the Green Party&#x27;s progressive principles and using authoritarian methods to consolidate power. The second article, published in December 2005, noted that four of the party&#x27;s eleven officers either resigned in protest or were suspended in the previous year, while a number of key positions were allowed to remain vacant. Dobbin also asserted that Harris&#x27;s opponents believe he was responsible for undermining the &quot;Living Platform&quot;, ignoring fundraising and policy development, and reducing party democracy.

Harris&#x27;s supporters accused Dobbin of conducting a partisan smear campaign and of ignoring Harris&#x27;s environmental credentials. Bill Hulet also defended Harris&#x27;s efforts to reform the party structure, describing the existing system as an &quot;absolute nightmare&quot; because of consensus policy requirements that give small minorities the right to override majority decisions. Harris has defended his record as party leader, noting that membership increased significantly during his tenure rising from approximately 700 members in the summer of 2003 to over 10,000 on the eve of the 2006 Leadership Convention.

===2006 campaign===
As in 2004, Harris unsuccessfully called for the Green Party to be included in the televised leadership debates for the 2006 election. Three days before the election, he predicted that his party would win one million votes. The Greens increased their total to 665,940 votes (4.5%), but again failed to elect any candidates. Harris was a candidate in Beaches—East York, and finished fourth against Liberal incumbent Maria Minna.

The GPC&#x27;s internal divisions were exposed during the election when former assistant national organizer Matthew Pollesel, who left the Green Party following a contract dispute, accused Harris of mismanaging the party&#x27;s finances. Pollesel charged that money had been spent without proper reporting, and called for Elections Canada to investigate possible wrongdoing. In addition, Dana Miller, a former party candidate who was not permitted to run in 2006, later called on Elections Canada to investigate Harris&#x27;s expenses from the 2004 leadership contest. Harris described the accusation as &quot;false, groundless and scurrilous&quot;, and the party threatened a libel lawsuit in each case, though no suits were actually filed. On 24 April 2006, Jim Harris announced that he would not stand for re-election as party leader at the Green Party of Canada&#x27;s August 2006 National Convention. On 26 August 2006, he was succeeded as leader by long-time environmental activist and former Sierra Club of Canada Executive Director Elizabeth May.

==Post-leadership==
Harris has remained active in the Green Party, maintaining blogs on the websites of both the federal Green Party and the Ontario Green Party. He continues to actively campaign for Green candidates. His Twitter profile is currently promoting Bernie Sanders.

<text>William Ralph Inge (; 6 June 1860 – 26 February 1954) was an English author, Anglican priest, professor of divinity at Cambridge, and dean of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. Although as an author he used W. R. Inge, and he was personally known as Ralph, he was widely known by his title as Dean Inge. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature three times.

== Early life and education ==

He was born on 6 June 1860 in Crayke, Yorkshire, England. His father, Rev. William Inge was the local curate, and would later go on to become Provost of Worcester College, Oxford. His mother was Susanna Inge ( Churton), daughter of Edward Churton, rector of Crayke and the Archdeacon of Cleveland. Inge had a &quot;staunchly high-church upbringing&quot;.

Inge was educated at Eton College, where he was a King&#x27;s Scholar and won the Newcastle Scholarship in 1879. In 1879, he went on to King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he won a number of prizes including the Chancellor&#x27;s Medal, as well as taking firsts in both parts of the Classical Tripos.

== Career ==

===Positions held===
Inge was an assistant master at Eton from 1884 to 1888, and a Fellow of King&#x27;s College from 1886 to 1888.

In the Church of England, he was ordained deacon in 1888, and priest in 1892.

He was a Fellow and Tutor at Hertford College, Oxford from 1889 to 1904.

His only parochial position was as vicar of All Saints, Knightsbridge, London, from 1905 to 1907.

In 1907, he moved to Jesus College, Cambridge, on being appointed Lady Margaret&#x27;s Professor of Divinity.

In 1911, he became Dean of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London. He served as president of the Aristotelian Society at Cambridge from 1920 to 1921.

He retired from full-time church ministry in 1934.

Inge was also a trustee of London&#x27;s National Portrait Gallery from 1921 until 1951.

===Writing===
Inge was a prolific author. In addition to scores of articles, lectures and sermons, he also wrote over 35 books. Inge was a columnist for the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; for many years, finishing in 1946.

He is best known for his works on Plotinus and neoplatonic philosophy, and on Christian mysticism, but also wrote on general topics of life and current politics.

He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature three times.

=== Views ===

Inge was a strong proponent of the spiritual type of religion—&quot;that autonomous faith which rests upon experience and individual inspiration&quot;—as opposed to one of coercive authority. He was therefore outspoken in his criticisms of the Roman Catholic Church. His thought, on the whole, represents a blending of traditional Christian theology with elements of Platonic philosophy. He shares this in common with one of his favourite writers, Benjamin Whichcote, the first of the Cambridge Platonists.

He was nicknamed &#x27;The Gloomy Dean&#x27; because of his pessimistic views in his Romanes Lecture of 1920, &quot;The Idea of Progress&quot; and in his &quot;Evening Standard&quot; articles. In his Romanes Lecture he said that although mankind&#x27;s accumulated experience and wonderful discoveries had great value, they did not constitute real progress in human nature itself.

He disapproved of democracy, which he called &quot;an absurdity&quot; and compared it to &quot;the famous occasion when the voice of the people cried, Crucify Him!&quot; He wrote &quot;Human beings are born unequal, and the only persons who have a right to govern their neighbours are those who are competent to do so.&quot; He advanced various arguments why women should have fewer voting rights than men, if any.

He was also a eugenicist and wrote considerably on the subject. In his book &quot;Outspoken Essays&quot;, he devotes an entire chapter to this subject. His views included that the state should decide which couples be allowed to have children.

Inge opposed social welfare &quot;on the grounds that it penalized the successful while subsidizing the weak and feckless&quot;.

He was also known for his support for nudism. He supported the publishing of Maurice Parmelee&#x27;s book, &quot;The New Gymnosophy: Nudity and the Modern Life&quot;, and was critical of town councillors who were insisting that bathers wear full bathing costumes.

=== Recognition ===
He was made a Commander of the Victorian Order (CVO) in 1918 and promoted to Knight Commander (KCVO) in 1930. He received Honorary Doctorates of Divinity from both Oxford and Aberdeen Universities, Honorary Doctorates of Literature from both Durham and Sheffield, and Honorary Doctorates of Laws from both Edinburgh and St Andrews. He was also an honorary fellow of both King&#x27;s and Jesus Colleges at Cambridge, and of Hertford College at Oxford. In 1921, he was elected as a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA), the United Kingdom&#x27;s national academy for the humanities and social sciences.

== Personal life ==
On 3 May 1905, Inge married Mary Catharine &quot;Kitty&quot; Spooner, daughter of Henry Maxwell Spooner, the Archdeacon of Maidstone. They had five children:
* William Craufurd Inge (1906–2001)
* Edward Ralph Churton Inge (1907–1980)
* Catharine Mary Inge (1910–1997), married Derek Wigram
* Margaret Paula Inge (1911–1923), died from type 1 diabetes
* Richard Wycliffe Spooner Inge (1915–1941), priest, killed on an RAF training flight

Inge&#x27;s wife died in 1949.

Inge spent his later life at Brightwell Manor in Brightwell-cum-Sotwell, Oxfordshire, where he died on 26 February 1954, aged 93, five years after his wife.

<text>Areography, also known as the [[geography]] of Mars, is a subfield of planetary science that entails the delineation and characterization of regions on Mars. Areography is mainly focused on what is called physical geography on Earth; that is the distribution of physical features across Mars and their cartographic representations. In April 2023, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported an updated global map of Mars based on images from the &quot;Hope&quot; spacecraft. A related, but much more detailed, global Mars map was released by NASA on 16 April 2023.

==History==
The first detailed observations of Mars were from ground-based telescopes. The history of these observations are marked by the oppositions of Mars, when the planet is closest to Earth and hence is most easily visible, which occur every couple of years. Even more notable are the perihelic oppositions of Mars which occur approximately every 16 years, and are distinguished because Mars is closest to earth and Jupiter perihelion making it even closer to Earth.

In September 1877, (a perihelic opposition of Mars occurred on September 5), Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli published the first detailed map of Mars. These maps notably contained features he called &quot;canali&quot; (&quot;channels&quot;), that were later shown to be an optical illusion. These &quot;canali&quot; were supposedly long straight lines on the surface of Mars to which he gave names of famous rivers on Earth. His term was popularly mistranslated as &quot;canals&quot;, and so started the Martian canal controversy.

Following these observations, it was a long-held belief that Mars contained vast seas and vegetation. It was not until spacecraft visited the planet during NASA&#x27;s Mariner missions in the 1960s that these myths were dispelled. Some maps of Mars were made using the data from these missions, but it wasn&#x27;t until the Mars Global Surveyor mission, launched in 1996 and ending in late 2006, that complete, extremely detailed maps were obtained.

==Cartography and geodesy==

Cartography is the art, science, and technology of making maps. 
Geodesy is the science of measuring the shape, orientation, and gravity of Earth and, by extension, other planetary bodies.
There are many established techniques specific to Earth that allow us to convert the 2D curved surface into 2D planes to facilitate mapping. To facilitate this on Mars, projections, coordinate systems, and datums needed to be established. Today, the United States Geological Survey defines thirty cartographic quadrangles for the surface of Mars. These can be seen below.

===Zero elevation===
On Earth, the zero elevation datum is based on sea level (the geoid).
Since Mars has no oceans and hence no &#x27;sea level&#x27;, it is convenient to define an arbitrary zero-elevation level or &quot;vertical datum&quot; for mapping the surface, called &quot;areoid&quot;.

The datum for Mars was defined initially in terms of a constant atmospheric pressure. From the Mariner 9 mission up until 2001, this was chosen as 610.5 Pa (6.105 mbar), on the basis that below this pressure liquid water can never be stable (i.e., the triple point of water is at this pressure). This value is only 0.6% of the pressure at sea level on Earth. Note that the choice of this value does not mean that liquid water does exist below this elevation, just that it could were the temperature to exceed 273.16 K (0.01 degrees C, 32.018 degrees F).

In 2001, Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter data led to a new convention of zero elevation defined as the equipotential surface (gravitational plus rotational) whose average value at the equator is equal to the mean radius of the planet.

===Zero latitude===

The origin of latitude is Mars&#x27;s mean equator, defined perpendicularly to its mean axis of rotation, removing periodic wobbles.

===Zero longitude===
Mars&#x27;s equator is defined by its rotation, but the location of its prime meridian was specified, as is Earth&#x27;s, by choice of an arbitrary point which later observers accepted. The German astronomers Wilhelm Beer and Johann Heinrich Mädler selected a small circular feature in the Sinus Meridiani (&#x27;Middle Bay&#x27; or &#x27;Meridian Bay&#x27;) as a reference point when they produced the first systematic chart of Mars features in 1830–1832. In 1877, their choice was adopted as the prime meridian by the Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli when he began work on his notable maps of Mars. In 1909 ephemeris-makers decided that it was more important to maintain continuity of the ephemerides as a guide to observations and this definition was &quot;virtually abandoned&quot;.

After the Mariner spacecraft provided extensive imagery of Mars, in 1972 the Mariner 9 Geodesy / Cartography Group proposed that the prime meridian pass through the center of a small 500 m diameter crater, named Airy-0, located in Sinus Meridiani along the meridian line of Beer and Mädler, thus defining 0.0° longitude with a precision of 0.001°. This model used the planetographic control point network developed by Merton Davies of the RAND Corporation.

As radiometric techniques increased the precision with which objects could be located on the surface of Mars, the center of a 500 m circular crater was considered to be insufficiently precise for exact measurements. The IAU Working Group on Cartographic Coordinates and Rotational Elements, therefore, recommended setting the longitude of the Viking 1 lander – for which there was extensive radiometric tracking data – as marking the standard longitude of 47.95137° west. This definition maintains the position of the center of Airy-0 at 0° longitude, within the tolerance of current cartographic uncertainties.

==Topography==


Across a whole planet, generalisation is not possible, and the geography of Mars varies considerably. The dichotomy of Martian topography is striking: northern plains flattened by lava flows contrast with the southern highlands, pitted and cratered by ancient impacts. The surface of Mars as seen from Earth is consequently divided into two kinds of areas, with differing albedo. 

The paler plains covered with dust and sand rich in reddish iron oxides were once thought of as Martian &#x27;continents&#x27; and given names like Arabia Terra (&quot;land of Arabia&quot;) or Amazonis Planitia (&quot;Amazonian plain&quot;). The dark features were thought to be seas, hence their names Mare Erythraeum, Mare Sirenum and Aurorae Sinus. The largest dark feature seen from Earth is Syrtis Major Planum.

The shield volcano, Olympus Mons (&quot;Mount Olympus&quot;), rises 22 km above the surrounding volcanic plains, and is the highest known mountain on any planet in the solar system. It is in a vast upland region called Tharsis, which contains several large volcanos. See list of mountains on Mars. The Tharsis region of Mars also has the solar system&#x27;s largest canyon system, Valles Marineris or the &quot;Mariner Valley&quot;, which is 4,000 km long and 7 km deep. Mars is also scarred by countless impact craters. The largest of these is the Hellas impact basin. See list of craters on Mars.

Mars has two permanent polar ice caps, the northern one located at Planum Boreum and the southern one at Planum Australe.

The difference between Mars&#x27;s highest and lowest points is nearly 30 km (from the top of Olympus Mons at an altitude of 21.2 km to Badwater Crater at the bottom of the Hellas impact basin at an altitude of 8.2 km below the datum). In comparison, the difference between Earth&#x27;s highest and lowest points (Mount Everest and the Mariana Trench) is only 19.7 km. Combined with the planets&#x27; different radii, this means Mars is nearly three times &quot;rougher&quot; than Earth.

The International Astronomical Union&#x27;s Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature is responsible for naming Martian surface features.

===Martian dichotomy===

Observers of Martian topography will notice a dichotomy between the northern and southern hemispheres. Most of the northern hemisphere is flat, with few impact craters, and lies below the conventional &#x27;zero elevation&#x27; level. In contrast, the southern hemisphere is mountains and highlands, mostly well above zero elevation. The two hemispheres differ in elevation by 1 to 3 km. The border separating the two areas is very interesting to geologists.

One distinctive feature is the fretted terrain. It contains mesas, knobs, and flat-floored valleys having walls about a mile high. Around many of the mesas and knobs are lobate debris aprons that have been shown to be rock-covered glaciers.

Other interesting features are the large river valleys and outflow channels that cut through the dichotomy.

The northern lowlands comprise about one-third of the surface of Mars and are relatively flat, with occasional impact craters. The other two-thirds of the Martian surface are the southern highlands. The difference in elevation between the hemispheres is dramatic. Because of the density of impact craters, scientists believe the southern hemisphere to be far older than the northern plains. Much of heavily cratered southern highlands date back to the period of heavy bombardment, the Noachian.

Multiple hypotheses have been proposed to explain the differences. The three most commonly accepted are a single mega-impact, multiple impacts, and endogenic processes such as mantle convection. Both impact-related hypotheses involve processes that could have occurred before the end of the primordial bombardment, implying that the crustal dichotomy has its origins early in the history of Mars.

The giant impact hypothesis, originally proposed in the early 1980s, was met with skepticism due to the impact area&#x27;s non-radial (elliptical) shape, where a circular pattern would be stronger support for impact by larger object(s). But a 2008 study provided additional research that supports a single giant impact. Using geologic data, researchers found support for the single impact of a large object hitting Mars at approximately a 45-degree angle. Additional evidence analyzing Martian rock chemistry for post-impact upwelling of mantle material would further support the giant impact theory.

==Nomenclature==

===Early nomenclature===
Although better remembered for mapping the Moon starting in 1830, Johann Heinrich Mädler and Wilhelm Beer were the first &quot;areographers&quot;. They started off by establishing once and for all that most of the surface features were permanent, and pinned down Mars&#x27;s rotation period. In 1840, Mädler combined ten years of observations and drew the first map of Mars ever made. Rather than giving names to the various markings they mapped, Beer and Mädler simply designated them with letters; Meridian Bay (Sinus Meridiani) was thus feature &quot;a&quot;.

Over the next twenty years or so, as instruments improved and the number of observers also increased, various Martian features acquired a hodge-podge of names. To give a couple of examples, Solis Lacus was known as the &quot;Oculus&quot; (the Eye), and Syrtis Major was usually known as the &quot;Hourglass Sea&quot; or the &quot;Scorpion&quot;. In 1858, it was also dubbed the &quot;Atlantic Canale&quot; by the Jesuit astronomer Angelo Secchi. Secchi commented that it &quot;seems to play the role of the Atlantic which, on Earth, separates the Old Continent from the New;&quot; this was the first time the fateful &quot;canale&quot;, which in Italian can mean either &quot;channel&quot; or &quot;canal&quot;, had been applied to Mars.

In 1867, Richard Anthony Proctor drew up a map of Mars. It was based, somewhat crudely, on the Rev. William Rutter Dawes&#x27; earlier drawings of 1865, then the best ones available. Proctor explained his system of nomenclature by saying, &quot;I have applied to the different features the names of those observers who have studied the physical peculiarities presented by Mars.&quot; Here are some of his names, paired with those later used by Schiaparelli in his Martian map created between 1877 and 1886. Schiaparelli&#x27;s names were generally adopted and are the names actually used today:

Proctor&#x27;s nomenclature has often been criticized, mainly because so many of his names honored English astronomers, but also because he used many names more than once. In particular, Dawes appeared no fewer than &quot;six&quot; times (Dawes Ocean, Dawes Continent, Dawes Sea, Dawes Strait, Dawes Isle, and Dawes Forked Bay). Even so, Proctor&#x27;s names are not without charm, and for all their shortcomings they were a foundation on which later astronomers would improve.

===Modern nomenclature===


Today, names of Martian features derive from a number of sources, but the names of the large features are derived primarily from the maps of Mars made in 1886 by the Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli. Schiaparelli named the larger features of Mars primarily using names from Greek mythology and to a lesser extent the Bible. Mars&#x27;s large albedo features retain many of the older names, but are often updated to reflect new knowledge of the nature of the features. For example, &#x27;Nix Olympica&#x27; (the snows of Olympus) has become Olympus Mons (Mount Olympus). 

Large Martian craters are named after important scientists and science fiction writers; smaller ones are named after towns and villages on Earth.

Various landforms studied by the Mars Exploration Rovers are given temporary names or nicknames to identify them during exploration and investigation. However, it is hoped that the International Astronomical Union will make permanent the names of certain major features, such as the Columbia Hills, which were named after the seven astronauts who died in the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster.

<doc id="425345" wikidata="Q217731" url="?curid=425345" title="Hajduk">
<text>A hajduk (, plural of ) is a type of irregular infantry found in Central, Eastern, and parts of Southeast Europe from the late 16th to mid 19th centuries, especially from Hajdú-Bihar county. They have reputations ranging from bandits to freedom fighters depending on time, place, and their enemies.

In the European lands of the Ottoman Empire, the term &quot;hajduk&quot; was used to describe bandits and brigands of the Balkans, while in Central Europe for the West Slavs, Hungarians, and Germans, and Eastern Europe for the Ukrainians, it was used to refer to outlaws who protected Christians against provocative actions by the Ottomans.

By the 17th century they were firmly established in the Ottoman Balkans, owing to increased taxes, Christian victories against the Ottomans, and a general decline in security. Hajduk bands predominantly numbered one hundred men each, with a firm hierarchy under one leader. They targeted Ottoman representatives and rich people, mainly rich Turks, for plunder or punishment to oppressive Ottomans, or revenge or a combination of all.

In Balkan folkloric tradition, the hajduk is a romanticised hero figure who steals from, and leads his fighters into battle against, the Ottoman authorities. They are comparable to the English legendary Robin Hood and his merry men, who stole from the rich (who as in the case of the hajduk happened to also be foreign occupiers) and gave to the poor, while defying seemingly unjust laws and authority.

People that helped hajduks were called jataks. Jataks lived in villages and towns and provided food and shelter for hajduks. In return, hajduks would give them part of the loot.

The hajduk of the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries commonly were as much guerrilla fighters against the Ottoman rule as they were bandits and highwaymen who preyed not only on Ottomans and their local representatives, but also on local merchants and travellers. As such, the term could also refer to any robber and carry a negative connotation.

==Etymology==
The etymology of the word &quot;hajduk&quot; is unclear. One theory is that &quot;hajduk&quot; was derived from the Turkish word &quot;haidut&quot; or &quot;haydut&quot; &#x27;bandit&#x27;, which was originally used by the Ottomans to refer to Hungarian and Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth infantry soldiers. Another theory suggests that the word comes from Hungarian &quot;hajtó&quot; or &quot;hajdó&quot; (plural &quot;hajtók&quot; or &quot;hajdók&quot;) &#x27;(cattle) drover&#x27;. These two theories do not necessarily contradict each other because the Turkish word &quot;haidut&quot; or &quot;haydut&quot; is adapted from the Hungarian &quot;hajtó&quot; or &quot;hajdó&quot;, just as many Slavic words were adapted from Turkish in what is known as Turcizam or Turkification.

Other spellings in English include &quot;ajduk&quot;, &quot;haydut&quot;, &quot;haiduk&quot;, &quot;haiduc&quot;, &quot;hayduck&quot;, and &quot;hayduk&quot;.
Forms of the word in various languages, in singular form, include:

* &quot;hajdut&quot;, in Albanian; in the ordinary sense of &quot;thief&quot;
* &quot;hayduk&quot; (հայդուկ), in Armenian; used as a male given name, and it means &quot;Armenian freedom fighter&quot;.
* &quot;haydut&quot; (хайдут), &quot;haydutin&quot; (хайдутин) or &quot;hayduk&quot; (хайдук), in Bulgarian
* &quot;haidouk&quot;, &quot;haiduque&quot;, in French

* &quot;hajdú&quot;, in Hungarian
* &quot;ajduk&quot; (ајдук), &quot;ajdutin&quot; (ајдутин), in Macedonian

==Irregular military==
===Kingdom of Hungary===

In 1604-1606, István Bocskay, Lord of Bihar, led an insurrection against the Habsburg Emperor, whose army had recently occupied Transylvania and begun a reign of terror. The bulk of Bocskay&#x27;s army was composed of serfs who had either fled from the war and the Habsburg drive toward Catholic conversion, or been discharged from the Imperial Army. These peasants, freelance soldiers, were known as the &quot;hajduks&quot;. As a reward for their service, Bocskay emancipated the hajduk from the jurisdiction of their lords, granted them land, and guaranteed them rights to own property and to personal freedom. The emancipated hajduk constituted a new &quot;warrior estate&quot; within Hungarian feudal society. Many of the settlements created at this time still bear the prefix &quot;Hajdú&quot; such as Hajdúbagos, Hajdúböszörmény, Hajdúdorog, Hajdúhadház, Hajdúnánás, Hajdúsámson, Hajdúszoboszló, Hajdúszovát, Hajdúvid etc., and the whole area is called &quot;Hajdúság&quot; (Land of the Hajduk) (see Hajdú County).

The Hajdú have always been an important pillar of Hungarian society and its defence. During the great Turkish attack of 1551/52, it was possible to recruit several hundred or even several thousand Hajdú troops from the Nyírség-Debrecen region for an action against the Turks. Among the Hungarians, the Hajdú lifestyle was significant. At the turn of the 16th and 17th centuries, we know of tens of thousands of hajdú, who were also the first to fight in wars in the first half of the 17th century. Their activities were significant both as mercenaries and as Defence Forces. Hajdú life provided social mobility, as their success was illustrated by the fact that, although they were born as peasant or petty nobles, they often received substantial land donations from the ruler and became quasi-nobility. 

===Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth===
The word &quot;hajduk&quot; was initially a colloquial term for a style of footsoldier, Hungarian or Turco-Balkan in inspiration, that formed the backbone of the Polish infantry arm from the 1570s until about the 1630s. Unusually for this period, Polish-Lithuanian hajduks wore uniforms, typically of grey-blue woolen cloth, with red collar and cuffs. Their principal weapon was a small calibre matchlock firearm, known as an arquebus. For close combat they also carried a heavy variety of sabre, capable of hacking off the heads of enemy pikes and polearms. Contrary to popular opinion, the small axe they often wore tucked in their belt (not to be confused with the huge half-moon shaped berdysz axe, which was seldom carried by hajduks) was not a combat weapon, but rather was intended for cutting wood.

In the mid-17th century hajduk-style infantry largely fell out of fashion in Poland-Lithuania, and were replaced by musket-armed infantry of Western style. However, commanders or hetmans of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth continued to maintain their own liveried bodyguards of hajduks, well into the 18th century as something of a throwback to the past, even though they were now rarely used as field troops. In imitation of these bodyguards, in the 18th century wealthy members of the szlachta hired liveried domestic servants whom they called hajduks, thereby creating the meaning of the term &#x27;hajduk&#x27; as it is generally understood in modern Polish.

===Serbian Militia (1718–39)===

The Serbs established a Hajduk army that supported the Austrians. The army was divided into 18 companies, in four groups. In this period, the most notable obor-kapetans were Vuk Isaković from Crna Bara, Mlatišuma from Kragujevac and Kosta Dimitrijević from Paraćin.

==Cultural influence==
The Croatian football team HNK Hajduk Split; Serbian football teams Hajduk Kula, FK Hajduk Beograd, FK Hajduk Veljko and Hajduk Lion; the Macedonian football team FK Hajduk - Vratnica; Czech amateur football team Hajduk Lipník; the pop-music project Haiducii, and Romanian Roma musical troupe Taraful Haiducilor are all named after the hajduci. The surnames of the fictional character George Washington Hayduke, invented by Edward Abbey, actress Stacy Haiduk, US national soccer team defender Frankie Hejduk, Czech Republic national ice hockey team forward Milan Hejduk and Montenegrin theoretical physicist Dragan Hajduković, are likewise derived from this word.

The term &quot;haiduci&quot; was used by the Romanian resistance movement Haiducii Muscelului, between 1947 and 1959, which opposed the Soviet occupation and the Communist government.

In the 2003 viral Moldovan pop song Dragostea Din Tei, the singer begins by introducing himself as a &#x27;haiduc&#x27;. In 2004, Haiducii herself released a successful cover of the song.

<text>Inge is a given name in various Germanic language-speaking cultures. In Swedish and Norwegian, it is mostly used as a masculine, but less often also as a feminine name, sometimes as a short form of Ingeborg, while in Danish, Estonian, Frisian, German and Dutch it is exclusively feminine. The feminine name has the variant &quot;Inga&quot;.

The name is in origin a hypocorism of names beginning in the element &quot;Ing-&quot; (such as Ingar, Inger, Ingrid, Ingeborg, Ingram, Ingvild, Ingunn etc.). These Germanic names made reference to either the god Ing or to the tribe of the Ingvaeones (who were presumably in turn named for the god).

Inge is also encountered as a surname in the English-speaking world; the surname is usually pronounced in England to rhyme with &quot;ring&quot;; alternatively (especially in the United States) some families pronounce it to rhyme with &quot;hinge.&quot;

<doc id="425351" wikidata="Q276310" url="?curid=425351" title="Duncan Edwards">
<text>Duncan Edwards (1 October 1936 – 21 February 1958) was an English footballer who played as a left-half for Manchester United and the England national team. He was one of the Busby Babes, the young United team formed under manager Matt Busby in the mid-1950s, playing 177 matches for the club. He was noted for his physical strength, toughness, and level of authority on the pitch, and has been ranked amongst the toughest players of all time. One of eight players who died as a result of the Munich air disaster, he survived initially but succumbed to his injuries in hospital two weeks later. Many of his contemporaries have described him as one of the best, if not the best, players with whom they had played.

Born in Woodside, Dudley, Edwards signed for Manchester United as a teenager and went on to become the youngest player to play in the Football League First Division and at the time the youngest England player since the Second World War, going on to play 18 times for his country at top level. In a professional career of less than five years he helped United to win two Football League championships and two FA Charity Shields, and reach the semi-finals of the European Cup.

==Early life==
Duncan Edwards was born on 1 October 1936 at 23 Malvern Crescent in the Woodside district of Dudley. He was the first child of Gladstone and Sarah Ann Edwards and their only child to survive to adulthood, his younger sister Carol Anne dying in 1947 at the age of 14 weeks. His cousin, three years his senior, was Dennis Stevens, who also went on to become a professional footballer.

Soon after Edwards was born, his family moved to 31 Elm Road on the Priory Estate, also in Dudley. Edwards attended Priory Infant and Junior Schools from 1941 to 1948, and Wolverhampton Street Secondary School from 1948 to 1952. He played football for his school as well as for Dudley Schools, Worcestershire and Birmingham and District teams, and also represented his school at morris dancing. He was selected to compete in the National Morris and Sword Dancing Festival, but was also offered a trial for the English Schools Football Association&#x27;s under-14 team, which fell on the same day, and opted to attend the latter.

Edwards impressed the selectors and was chosen to play for the English Schools XI, making his debut against the equivalent team from Wales at Wembley Stadium on 1 April 1950. He was soon appointed captain of the team, a position he held for two seasons. By this stage, he had already attracted the attention of major clubs, with Manchester United scout Jack O&#x27;Brien reporting back to manager Matt Busby in 1948 that he had &quot;today seen a 12-year-old schoolboy who merits special watching. His name is Duncan Edwards, of Dudley.&quot;

Joe Mercer, who was then coaching the England schools team, urged Busby to sign Edwards, who was also attracting interest from Wolverhampton Wanderers and Aston Villa. Edwards signed for United as an amateur on 2 June 1952, but accounts of when he signed his first professional contract vary. Some reports state that it occurred on his 17th birthday in October 1953, but others contend that it took place a year earlier. Those accounts that favour the earlier date usually state that a club official, either Busby himself or coach Bert Whalley, arrived at the Edwards family home soon after midnight to secure the youngster&#x27;s signature as early as possible, but other reports claim that this occurred when he signed his amateur contract. Wolves manager Stan Cullis was indignant at missing out on a highly touted local youngster and accused United of improperly offering financial inducements to Edwards or his family, but Edwards maintained that he had always wanted to play for the Lancashire team. To guard against the possibility that he might not make a success of his football career, he also began an apprenticeship as a carpenter.

==Career==
Edwards began his Manchester United career in the youth team and made several appearances for the team that won the first ever FA Youth Cup in 1953, but by the time of the final had already made his debut for the first team. On 4 April 1953 he played in a Football League First Division match against Cardiff City, which United lost 4–1, aged just 16 years and 185 days. Mindful of the fact that his team contained a large number of ageing players, Busby was keen to bring new young players through the ranks. Edwards, along with the likes of Dennis Viollet and Jackie Blanchflower, was among a number of youngsters introduced to the team that season, and the new group of players came to be known collectively as the Busby Babes. Reviewing his performance on his first-team debut the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; newspaper commented that &quot;he showed promise of fine ability in passing and shooting, but will have to move faster as a wing half&quot;.

The 1953–54 season saw Edwards emerge as a semi-regular player in the United first team. After impressing in a friendly against Kilmarnock he replaced the injured Henry Cockburn for the away match against Huddersfield Town on 31 October 1953, and went on to appear in 24 league matches as well as United&#x27;s FA Cup defeat to Burnley. Nonetheless he was also still an active part of the youth squad and played in the team which won the Youth Cup for the second consecutive season. He made his first appearance for the national under-23 team on 20 January 1954 in Italy, and was considered for inclusion in the full England team, but on the day when the selection committee watched him in action, against Arsenal on 27 March, he gave a poor performance and was not called up.

The following season, he established himself as United&#x27;s regular left-half, making 36 first-team appearances and scoring his first goals at senior level, finishing the season with six to his name. His performances revived calls for him to be selected for the senior England team, and a member of the selection committee was despatched to watch him play against Huddersfield Town on 18 September 1954, when he was just short of his 18th birthday, but nothing came of it in the short term, although he was selected for a Football League XI which played an exhibition match against a Scottish League team. In March he played for England B against an equivalent team from Germany and, despite being criticised in the press for his &quot;poor showing&quot;, was called up for the full national team a week later. He made his debut in a match against Scotland on 2 April 1955 in the British Home Championship aged 18 years and 183 days, making him England&#x27;s youngest debutant since the Second World War, a record which stood for 43 years, until Michael Owen made his England debut in February 1998. Three weeks later United took advantage of the fact that he was still eligible for the youth team to select him for the club&#x27;s third consecutive FA Youth Cup final. The decision to field an England international player in the youth team was heavily criticised, and Matt Busby was forced to pen a newspaper article defending this decision, which paid off for United as the wing-half was instrumental in a third Youth Cup win. By now, the younger players were rapidly taking over the first team.

In May 1955, Edwards was selected for the England squad which travelled to mainland Europe for matches against France, Portugal and Spain, starting all three matches. Upon returning from the tour, he began a two-year stint in the British Army with the Royal Army Ordnance Corps. Army service was compulsory at the time for all men of his age under the national service scheme, with the exception of students and those working in certain trades. He was stationed at Nesscliffe near Shrewsbury along with teammate Bobby Charlton, 12 months his junior, but was allowed leave to play for United. He also served in Wales alongside future Tottenham Hotspur manager Keith Burkinshaw. Edwards took part in army matches, and in one season played nearly 100 matches in total. In the 1955–56 season, despite missing nearly two months of action due to a severe bout of influenza, Edwards played 33 times as United won the championship of the Football League by a margin of 11 points ahead of their nearest challengers Blackpool. The following season he made 34 league appearances, taking his total past the 100 mark, as United won a second consecutive league title, and was also in the team that contested the 1957 FA Cup Final, in which United missed out on the Double after a 2–1 defeat to Aston Villa. He also made seven appearances during United&#x27;s first ever foray into the European Cup, including a 10–0 win over Anderlecht which remains the club&#x27;s biggest-ever margin of victory. United reached the semi-finals of this competition, being ousted by Real Madrid.

By now he was also a regular in the England team, featuring in all four of England&#x27;s qualifying matches for the 1958 World Cup and scoring two goals in the 5–2 win over Denmark on 5 December 1956. He was expected to be a key player for England in the 1958 World Cup, and was seen as a likely candidate to replace the ageing Billy Wright as national team captain.

Edwards began the 1957–58 season in good form and rumours abounded that top Italian clubs were seeking to sign him, as United battled with Wolverhampton Wanderers in their bid for a third successive league title, and made a strong start to their quest in the FA Cup and European Cup. His final match in England took place on 1 February 1958, when he scored the opening goal to help United defeat Arsenal 5–4 at Highbury. The press were critical of his performance, with the &quot;Sunday Pictorial&quot;″s correspondent writing that he did not &quot;think [Edwards&#x27;] display in this thrilling game would impress England team manager Walter Winterbottom, who was watching. He was clearly at fault for Arsenal&#x27;s fourth goal when, instead of clearing, he dallied on the ball&quot;. Five days later he played his last ever match as United drew 3–3 away to Red Star Belgrade to progress to the semi-finals of the European Cup by an aggregate score of 5–4.

==Death==

Returning home from Belgrade on 6 February 1958, the aeroplane carrying Edwards and his teammates crashed on takeoff after a refuelling stop in Munich, Germany. Seven players and 14 other passengers died at the scene, and Edwards was taken to the Rechts der Isar Hospital suffering from many serious injuries including multiple leg fractures, fractured ribs and severely damaged kidneys. The doctors treating him were confident that he could recover, but were doubtful that he would ever be able to play football again.

Edwards regained consciousness soon after reaching the hospital. Over the next two weeks, his condition fluctuated. Doctors had an artificial kidney rushed to the hospital for him, but the artificial organ reduced his blood&#x27;s ability to clot and he began to bleed internally. Despite this, the day after the crash he asked assistant manager Jimmy Murphy, &quot;What time is the kick off against Wolves, Jimmy? I mustn&#x27;t miss that match.&quot; By 14 February, his condition was reported to have &quot;dramatically improved&quot;. By 19 February, his condition had deteriorated again, and it was reported that he was &quot;sinking rapidly&quot;, with use of the artificial kidney machine developing into a &quot;vicious circle, gradually sapping his strength&quot;.

Doctors had said several days earlier that they were &quot;amazed&quot; at his fight for life, and the next day a &quot;very slight improvement&quot; in his condition was reported, Nurses noticed that his circulation was failing, and injections briefly improved this, but his strength ebbed away and medical staff were unable to save him. He died at 2:15 a.m. on 21 February 1958. Hours before his death, by coincidence, a new issue of &quot;Charles Buchan&#x27;s Football Monthly&quot; was published in the United Kingdom, with a photograph of a smiling Edwards on the cover.

Edwards was buried at Dudley Cemetery five days later, alongside his sister Carol Anne. More than 5,000 people lined the streets of Dudley for his funeral. His tombstone reads: &quot;A day of memory, Sad to recall, Without farewell, He left us all&quot; and his grave is regularly visited by fans.

==Legacy==
Edwards has been commemorated in a number of ways in his home town of Dudley. A stained-glass window depicting Edwards, designed by Francis Skeat and paid for with donations from Football League clubs Brentford and Crystal Palace, was unveiled in St Francis&#x27;s Church, the parish church for the Priory Estate, by Matt Busby in 1961, and a statue of Edwards unveiled in the centre of the town in October 1999 by his mother and his former team-mate Bobby Charlton.

In 1993, a cul-de-sac of housing association homes near to the cemetery in which he is buried was named &quot;Duncan Edwards Close&quot;. The Wren&#x27;s Nest pub on the Priory Estate, near where he grew up, was renamed &quot;The Duncan Edwards&quot; in honour of him in 2001, but it closed within five years and was subsequently destroyed by arsonists before being demolished. In 2006, a £100,000 games facility was opened in Priory Park, where Edwards often played as a boy, in his memory. It was unveiled by Sir Bobby Charlton. In 2008, Dudley&#x27;s southern bypass was renamed &#x27;Duncan Edwards Way&#x27; in his memory—this road had coincidentally opened to traffic nearly a decade earlier on the same day that his statue was unveiled.

Until its closure in 2016, Dudley Museum and Art Gallery hosted an exhibition of memorabilia devoted to his career, including his England caps. This collection had originally been displayed at Dudley Leisure Centre in 1986, again with his mother and Bobby Charlton in attendance.

A housing complex called Duncan Edwards Court exists in Manchester among a network of streets named after his fellow Munich victims, including Eddie Colman, Roger Byrne and Tommy Taylor. On 8 July 2011 a Blue Plaque was unveiled by Bobby Charlton at the site of the digs in Stretford where Edwards and other United players lived, and in 2016 local dignitaries in Dudley launched a fundraising drive with the aim of placing a similar plaque in the town. In 2022, a new leisure centre complex opened in Dudley and was named the Duncan Edwards Leisure Centre.

In 1996, Edwards was one of five deceased players chosen to appear on British stamps issued as part of a &quot;Football Legends&quot; set issued to commemorate the UEFA Euro 1996 tournament, which England was hosting. He was portrayed by Sam Claflin in the 2011 British TV film &quot;United&quot; centred on the Munich disaster and the success of the team in the two years leading up to it.

Contemporaries of Edwards have been unstinting in their praise of his abilities. Bobby Charlton described him as the best he ever saw or was likely to see. He also considered Edwards &quot;the only player that made me feel inferior&quot; and said his death was &quot;the biggest single tragedy ever to happen to Manchester United and English football&quot;. Terry Venables said that, had he lived, it would have been Edwards, not Bobby Moore, who lifted the World Cup trophy as England captain in 1966. Tommy Docherty stated that &quot;there is no doubt in my mind that Duncan would have become the greatest player ever. Not just in British football, with United and England, but the best in the world. George Best was something special, as was Pelé and Maradona, but in my mind Duncan was much better in terms of all-round ability and skill.&quot; In recognition of his talents Edwards was made an inaugural inductee to the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002. His memorabilia were exhibited at Dudley Museum prior to its closure, and was subsequently sold to Manchester United with a selection to be loaned back for display at the Dudley Archives.

==Style of play==

Although he is primarily remembered as a defensive midfielder, Edwards is said to have been able to operate in any outfield position. His versatility was such that on one occasion he started the match playing as an emergency striker in place of one injured player before being switched to central defence in place of another. His greatest assets were his physical strength and his level of authority on the pitch, which was said to be remarkable for such a young player, and he was particularly noted for his high level of stamina. Stanley Matthews described him as being &quot;like a rock in a raging sea&quot;, and Bobby Moore likened him to the Rock of Gibraltar when defending but also noted that he was &quot;dynamic coming forward&quot;. His imposing physique earned him the nicknames &quot;Big Dunc&quot; and &quot;The Tank&quot;, and he has been ranked amongst the toughest players of all time.

Edwards was noted for the power and timing of his tackles and for his ability to pass and shoot equally well with both feet. He was known for his surging runs up the pitch and was equally skilled at heading the ball and at striking fierce long-range shots. After scoring a goal on 26 May 1956, in a 3–1 friendly win against West Germany, he was given the nickname &quot;Boom Boom&quot; by the local press because of &quot;the Big Bertha shot in his boots&quot;.

==Outside football==
Edwards was teetotal, and outside football he was known as a very private individual, whose interests included fishing, playing cards and visiting the cinema. Although he attended dances with his teammates he was never confident in social surroundings. He was described by Jimmy Murphy as an &quot;unspoilt boy&quot; and retained a strong Black Country accent which his teammates would impersonate. He was once stopped by the police for riding his bicycle without lights and fined five shillings by the authorities and two weeks&#x27; wages by his club.

At the time of his death Edwards was living in lodgings in Gorse Avenue, Stretford. He was engaged to be married to Molly Leech, who was 22 years old and worked in the offices of a textile machine manufacturer in Altrincham. The couple met at a function at a hotel at Manchester Airport, dated for a year before becoming engaged, and were godparents to the daughter of Leech&#x27;s friend Josephine Stott.

Edwards appeared in advertisements for Dextrosol glucose tablets and had written a book entitled &quot;Tackle Soccer This Way&quot;, commercial endeavours which supplemented his wage of £15 per week during the season and £12 per week during the summer. The book was published shortly after his death with the approval of his family and, after being out of print for many years, was re-published in November 2009.

<text>Buckley () is a town and community in Flintshire, North East Wales, from the county town of Mold and contiguous with the villages of Ewloe, Alltami and Mynydd Isa. It is on the A549 road, with the larger A55 road passing nearby.

Buckley is the second-largest town in Flintshire in terms of population. At the 2011 Census, its community had a population of 15,665. When the contiguous Argoed community is included, Buckley has a population of 21,502.

A prominent nearby landmark is the Heidelberg Materials cement kiln just south of the town.

== Toponymy ==
Buckley&#x27;s name appears as &quot;Bocleghe&quot; in 1198 and &quot;Bokkeley&quot; in 1294. It may mean &quot;clearing of the bucks&quot;, from Old English &quot;bucc lēah&quot;; however, the preponderance of an O vowel in historical forms suggests that the first element could instead be a personal name, &quot;Bocca&quot;. Another contender is &quot;bōca&quot;, meaning &quot;beeches&quot;, but the fact that beech trees weren&#x27;t introduced into North Wales until the 18th century argues against this.

== History ==
In medieval times the area was part of three manors and lordships: Mold, Hawarden, and Ewloe. In 1420, Henry V presented Ewloe and the pasturage of Buckley to his wife, Catherine of Valois, as a wedding present. It was worth £26 per annum.

The town became an industrial heartland for pottery and coal mining between the 17th and 19th centuries. The first was opened in 1737. However, it only grew into any kind of prominence during the Industrial Revolution of the 18th century, when coal and clay were extensively mined there, and the name Buckley became synonymous with the production of various fire-clay and pottery products. By the early 19th century, there were 14 potteries in the town.

Buckley was a popular location for mining, as there were many faults in local rock formations that allowed seams of coal to be mined directly from the surface. Its heavy, clay soil also allowed for excellent pottery and bricks to be manufactured. Bricks from Buckley were transported all across the United Kingdom and as far as the United States, as Buckley became a brickworking centre. A great deal of people moved into the area, particularly from Ireland and Liverpool to find work in the mining and brick industries, giving the town a distinctive accent. Many pottery and earthenware products manufactured were taken on the backs of donkeys to either Chester market or exported via the River Dee, as early as the reign of Elizabeth I. The last pottery kiln was fired in 1946. The site of the brickworks is now being redeveloped as a housing estate. However, a local cement works is still in operation.

In 1932, a tradition started in Buckley of running an annual pantomime. Dennis Griffiths produced a version of Dick Whittington in 1933, and ran the pantomime for 27 years, famously using the programme to invite any and all complaints to arrive written &quot;on the back of a 10 shilling note (non-returnable)&quot;.

In the Second World War, a Nazi German Luftwaffe plane, most likely on its way to blitz Liverpool, was shot down and crash landed in a nearby district, with the plane&#x27;s engine crashing into a small lake known locally as &#x27;The Trap&#x27;. The pilot survived, captured by a Special Constable, Peter Griffiths, and taken to Hawarden Prisoner of War camp.

==Governance==

Urban district status was conferred on the town in 1898; at this time, the area comprised two parishes, Buckley (1874) and Bistre (1844). The urban district of Buckley was formed of Pentrobin and Bannel (which was formerly a part of the parish of Hawarden), Argoed, and Bistre (the oldest part of the town). Wat&#x27;s Dyke formed the western boundary. The urban district council was based at the council offices in Brunswick Road. Before then, it was divided between the parishes of Mold and Hawarden.

Today, Buckley Town Council consists of 20 councillors, elected from four wards. These are called Buckley Mountain, Pentrobin, Bistre East and Bistre West.

The same wards elect councillors to Flintshire County Council, one from Buckley Mountain, and two from each of the others.

Buckley is part of the Alyn and Deeside UK parliamentary constituency and the Alyn and Deeside Senedd constituency and North Wales region.

==Geography and climate==
Buckley is situated in north east Wales approximately from the border with England to the East. Buckley is in the lee of the Snowdonian mountain range to the west and is therefore in a rain shadow area. Average annual rainfall in Buckley is approximately which is significantly lower than areas to the West of the Snowdonian mountain range. However, in comparison to areas in the East and South East of the United Kingdom, Buckley still receives a fair amount of rainfall. Since Buckley is located approximately above sea level, snowfall is more frequent in winter months in comparison to the lower lying ground in neighbouring areas.

Areas in the parish of Buckley outside the town centre include Bistre, Lane End, Padeswood, Buckley Mountain, Drury, Pentrobin, Bannel, and Alltami.

== Dialect ==
Although very few locals speak with a &#x27;Buckley&#x27; accent nowadays, due to people moving in and out of the area, and with the proliferation of television and radio, a few of the town&#x27;s older citizens still speak in a form of the strongly accented dialect, full of colloquialisms, and often unintelligible to outsiders. One of the last remaining pure &#x27;Buckley&#x27; speakers was noted linguist Dennis Griffiths, a Buckley resident, who died in 1972, and whose books are the main repository and record of the dialect. A few examples (mainly phonetic) are noted below:
*&quot;Wunst every blue moon&quot; – rarely occurring
*&quot;Thou fries me to death&quot; – the limit of boredom
*&quot;A lick and a promise&quot; – a quick wash
*&quot;Fasen the fost un fost&quot; – fasten the first one first
*&quot;The daddy on um aw&quot; – the best of the lot
*&quot;Husht thee naise&quot; – be quiet
*&quot;I conna meke thee out&quot; – I can&#x27;t understand you
*&quot;Chunner&quot; – Complain

The last &#x27;pure&#x27; speaker of the Buckley dialect was Joseph Charles Shone, a foundryman born in 1917, who died in 1987.
An example of the Buckley dialect was recorded by community heritage archivist John Butler in 2016. In this item, long-time Buckley resident Margaret Shone recounts one of Dennis Griffiths&#x27;s specially written stories, an adaptation of the Parable of the Prodigal Son into the Buckley dialect.

==Economy==
Today, Buckley has a population of around 20,000, and has numerous light industries. Those who cannot find work locally commute to Deeside, Cheshire, Wrexham and Merseyside.

The Heidelberg Materials cement works at Padeswood is the only large scale industry remaining in the town. Its kiln is now the major landmark on the skyline, visible from many miles away. Despite many locals considering it an eyesore, according to its website, the company has reduced pollution produced by the cement works by up to 90%.

==Community facilities==
Buckley has a large area of common land, known simply as &#x27;The Common&#x27;. It has a large playground for children, as well as a duck pond. A funfair visits during the Buckley Jubilee in the summer, usually on the second Tuesday of July, which is the town jubilee.

There is also a small lake, known as &#x27;The Trap&#x27;, which is stocked with coarse fish. A German Messerschmitt bomber crashed into the Trap during World War II, shot down by anti-aircraft fire after going off course following a bombing run over Liverpool. The land is primarily heavy clay soil. Etna Park, which is just a short walk from the town centre, is part of the Heritage Trail walk in the area.

Buckley has a shopping precinct, as well as three supermarkets, Aldi, Iceland and Home Bargains. There is a town-centre car park which is charged at 30p per hour. The town contains a wide variety of public houses, which includes the local working men&#x27;s club. The local branch of The Royal British Legion closed in 2010 and has since been demolished.

==Education==
Buckley has four primary schools: Westwood County Primary (Formerly known as West Lea infants and Buckley CP – juniors) which is on Tabernacle Street, Southdown Primary School on Linderick Avenue, Mountain Lane Primary School on Knowle Lane, and Drury County Primary on Beech Road, Drury.

Buckley has one secondary school, the Elfed High School, located near the Common on Mill Lane. The school includes a sports centre and a swimming pool, for use of both the students and the public. Many students from Buckley also attend Argoed High School, located in nearby Bryn-y-Baal, or the Alun School, in Mold. All schools in Buckley are run by the Flintshire Local Education Authority.

==Religion==
Buckley is unusual in having two ecclesiastical parishes. The Church of St Matthew is the oldest parish church in the town, and was consecrated in 1822. Bistre Emmanuel Parish Church was built in 1842, despite appearing much older due to its early Gothic-style architecture. The first Primitive Methodist church in Wales is on the outskirts of Buckley, in Alltami.

The present St John&#x27;s United Reformed Church was originally a chapel known as &quot;Chapel in the Meadow&quot;, set up by a noncomformist pottery owner, Jonathan Catherall, in 1811. Before that date, Catherall had held services in his house which he named after Lord Hawkesbury. As the Church forbade chapels from having bells, he built a bell tower in the grounds of his home. The site of this unique non-conformist bell tower is marked by a mound and plaque near the skate park at the Elfed Sports Complex.

The Our Lady of the Rosary Catholic church in Buckley was built in 2000 to replace a much older building. Other churches in Buckley include Bistre Methodist, Pentrobin Methodist, Buckley Cross Methodist, Bryn Methodist, and Drury Lane Methodist.

==Culture==
===Events===

Buckley observes an annual regional celebration and march that is over 200 years old called the Buckley Jubilee, which is celebrated on the second Tuesday of July. Officially, however, the Jubilee was begun in 1856. The difference in dates stems from the &#x27;official&#x27; date being set when the Buckley Temperance Society first sanctioned the march. The Jubilee is a ceremonial march that begins on &quot;The Common&quot;, a large area of common ground owned by the people of the town used for leisure and recreational purposes. The term &#x27;jubilee&#x27; was first used in 1871.

A non-denominational Service led by the minister of the church or chapel leading the Jubilee that year is held on the Common, starting at around 3pm. The Sunday before the Jubilee, the leading church is presented with the Centenary Shield, which they hold for the year. A fifteen-minute service takes place, with two hymns accompanied by the Royal Buckley Town Band. The march then leaves the common, and marches through the town, with representatives from the local Sunday Schools, Scout and Guide troops, and many of the local schools. Banners from each of the local churches are carried.

===Royal Buckley Town Band===
Buckley has a famous brass band, the Royal Buckley Town Band. The band is one of only two in the entire United Kingdom to have received sanction from a British monarch to use &quot;Royal&quot; in their name. They lead the Jubilee every year.

===Popular music===
Buckley has one nightclub, the Tivoli Nightclub (known locally as &quot;The Tiv&quot;), on Brunswick Road. Formerly both a cinema and a music hall, the Tivoli has seen many bands play there over the years, including Uriah Heep, Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin in the early 1970s, and many Britpop bands including Oasis, Ocean Colour Scene and the Super Furry Animals in the 1990s. It has been described as &#x27;one of the finest quirky little venues of our time&#x27; and is featured in the DVD re-issue of Oasis&#x27;s album, &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot;. Between summer 1992 and spring 1993, Radiohead played there twice. Bands such as Cast, Ash, Stiff Little Fingers, Fun Lovin&#x27; Criminals, Skindred, Hed PE and OPM have all played there. Since a renovation and rebranding in 2000, few bands played live at the venue, with the club music policy having more emphasis on commercial dance and pop music, with a rock night on Fridays. The venue attracts crowds from Chester, Wrexham, Manchester and Liverpool.

===Radio===
The town was also home to a community radio project which used to broadcast &#x27;trial&#x27; or &#x27;temporary radio&#x27; licences to Buckley, Broughton, Mold, Deeside and the surrounding areas. The station was known as South Flintshire Radio and its offices were found above the swimming baths on Mold Road. The station was heard on eight separate occasions between November 1996 and July 2000 as part of a campaign to bring a local radio station to Flintshire, following the demise of Mold-based BBC Radio Clwyd. The project helped pave the way for a permanent local radio licence which was awarded to Chester FM (known as Dee 106.3) which broadcasts to Chester, Ellesmere Port, Deeside and Buckley.

===Library===
Buckley has a sizable two-storey library, with the second level being dedicated solely to history and reference pieces, mainly on the local area. The second floor also doubles as the local museum.

==Sport==
Buckley has a football club in the Cymru North league, Buckley Town F.C. In addition to the men&#x27;s team Buckley also has a women&#x27;s team, Buckley Town Ladies FC, who play in the North Wales Coast Women&#x27;s Football League.

The Elfed Sports Complex was built in 2005, near the Elfed High School, and includes a swimming pool, which replaced the outdated, Victorian-style baths on the Mold Road high street.

==Transport==
===Road===
Buckley is located on the A549 road, and is near the A55 expressway, which passes to the south of Ewloe. Buckley is part of a trial run to bring 20 MPH to towns all over Wales. This means most roads in Buckley are 20 MPH.

===Bus===
There are a number of bus routes that pass through Buckley, mostly operated by Arriva Buses Wales, which now means on most weekdays a bus to Chester or Mold is available every 10 minutes.

===Rail===
Buckley has previously been served by up to three different stations on lines operated by the Wrexham, Mold and Connah&#x27;s Quay Railway and the Mold Railway. Services to Mold and Connah&#x27;s Quay have been discontinued and the old train lines removed. Many features remain visible particularly within Knowle Hill Nature Reserve to the east of the town.

Today, Buckley railway station is a minor stop on the Borderlands Line, which runs from Wrexham to Bidston on the Wirral. It is operated by Transport for Wales. Trains run every 60 minutes, Monday to Saturday daytimes, and less frequently on evenings and Sundays. Connections can be made at Shotton, Wrexham General, and at Bidston for Liverpool. There are two platforms, one for each direction the line runs in.

===Air===
The nearest major airports are Liverpool John Lennon Airport and Manchester Airport, both around 45 minutes&#x27; drive away, although Hawarden Airport is a minor airfield nearby at Broughton.

<text>Vyborg Bay (; ; ) is a deep inlet running northeastward near the eastern end of Gulf of Finland in the Baltic Sea. The city of Vyborg is located near the head of the gulf.

The Monrepos Park is considered a jewel of the bay and a major draw for tourists. Since the mid-19th century, the bay has been connected by the Saimaa Canal to the lake Saimaa in Finland.

In 1790, the bay was the scene of one of the largest naval battles in history, the Battle of Vyborg Bay, with a total of 498 Russian and Swedish ships.

The end of the bay is called Zashchitnaya Bay (, . In the Middle Ages, the river 
Vuoksi had an outlet there, which however dried up little by little due to post-glacial rebound and was left completely dry in 1857 when the Kiviniemi rapids in Losevo (, ), Karelian isthmus were formed and the Burnaya River became the main outlet of Vuoksa.

Lodochnyy Island lies in the middle of the bay, between Vyborg and Vysotsk.

<doc id="425359" wikidata="Q1690938" url="?curid=425359" title="Job Definition Format">
<text>JDF (Job Definition Format) is a technical standard developed by the graphic arts industry to facilitate cross-vendor workflow implementations of the application domain. It is an XML format about job ticket, message description, and message interchange. JDF is managed by CIP4, the International Cooperation for the Integration of Processes in Prepress, Press and Postpress Organization. JDF was initiated by Adobe Systems, Agfa, Heidelberg and MAN Roland in 1999 but handed over to CIP3 at Drupa 2000. CIP3 then renamed itself CIP4.

The initial focus was on sheetfed offset and digital print workflow, but has been expanded to web(roll)-fed systems, newspaper workflows and packaging and label workflows.

It is promulgated by the prepress industry association CIP4, and is generally regarded as the successor to CIP3&#x27;s Print Production Format (PPF) and Adobe Systems&#x27; Portable Job Ticket Format (PJTF).

The JDF standard is at revision 1.8. The process of defining and promulgating JDF began circa 1999. The standard is in a fairly mature state; and a number of vendors have implemented or are in the process of implementing it. JDF PARC, a multivendor JDF interoperability demonstration, was a major event at the 2004 Drupa print industry show, and featured 21 vendors demonstrating, or attempting to demonstrate interoperability between a total of about forty pairs of products.

JDF is an extensible format. It defines both JDF files and JMF, a job messaging format based on XML over HTTP. In practice, JDF-enabled products can communicate with each other either by exchanging JDF files, typically via &quot;hot folders&quot;, or the net or by exchanging JMF messages over the net.

As is typical of workflow applications, the JDF message contains information that enables each &quot;node&quot; to determine what files it needs as input and where they are found, and what processes it should perform. It then modifies the JDF job ticket to describe what it has done, and examines the JDF ticket to determine where the message and accompanying files should be sent next.

The goal of CIP4 and the JDF format is to encompass the whole life cycle of a print and cross-media job, including device automation, management data collection and job-floor mechanical production process, including even such things as bindery, assembly of finished products on pallets.

Before JDF can be completely realized, more vendors need to accept the standard. Therefore, few users have been able to completely utilize the benefits of the JDF system. In finishing and binding, and printing there is a tradition of automation and few large enough dominating companies that can steer the development of JDF system. But it is still necessary for the manufacturers of business systems to fully support JDF. The same progress has not been made here probably because many of these companies are small specialty companies who haven&#x27;t the resource to manage such development and who don&#x27;t specialize on graphic production.

In addition, there is a huge amount of large-capital production machinery already existing in the trade which is incompatible with JDF. The graphic arts business is shrinking yearly and any large-capital decision is much more a risk than in previous years. The underlying incentive to adopt JDF is not sufficient in most cases to cause owners to abandon &quot;acceptable&quot; machinery that they presently have in favour of a large-capital purchase of somewhat faster, JDF-compliant capital goods. This is especially true in markets where large amounts of non-compliant production machinery are being sold in the used-equipment market and auction sales at considerable reductions in price from new equipment.

==For printing proofing==

===Introduction to proofing===
Before describing the implementation of proofing in JDF, it&#x27;s better to know a little about the terminology
that will be used.

# Proofing: the process of producing a printed output on a device (proofer) that emulates the best it can the supposed printed output on press (the final production device that can be a conventional press, a digital press…) where the final printed product will be produced. Prepress proofing (or off-press proofing) provide a visual copy without creating a press proof (the process is cheaper).
# Soft proofing: the same as proofing, but the proofer is actually a screen.
# Approval: the process of approving or rejecting the proofing (or the soft proofing). Comments and annotations may be added to describe the reasons of the decision and to give instructions on what changes to do.

The original input files have to be processed to be printed on the final press (interpreting, rendering, screening, color management...) and the same to be printed on the proofer (different characteristics). The decision on which of the processing steps will be executed once (common both for printing on the proofer and on the press) and which not will depend on many parameters (characteristics of the proofer device, user requirements, workflow requirements…). The proofing has to take in account the consistency between the press and the proofer.

===Proofing in JDF===
In JDF 1.1, proofing and soft proofing were defined as an atomic process on which the input were all the parameters required for a successful process. This has some drawbacks:

# Lack of flexibility: the semantics is specific for one workflow therefore limited to the definition of the processes and the resources that it can take as input.
# Lack of control: it is difficult to define the input resources with all the information required for control.
# Duplication: similar information has to be used to define both proofing and printing. If different resources are used, this will result in duplication.

From JDF 1.2 proofing and soft proofing were deprecated in behalf of a combined process to specify the proofing workflow. The job ticket explicitly defines the processing and provides the flexibility to implement them in different workflows. In order to do that, the atomic processes were made capable of keeping all the information necessary to specify different configurations/options.

===Combined processes for proofing===
It is impossible to describe proofing by a unique combination of processes which in turn will depend on the capabilities of the RIPs (Raster image processor), the devices used for proofing and the proofing production workflow. It is still possible to define a generic combined process for the proofing. This will allow it to describe its step in a workflow. The generic combined proofing process combines the following JDF processes:

* ColorSpaceConversion (1): converts the contents of the input RunList from the input color spaces to the color model of the press.
* Interpreting: interprets the input RunList file(s) and converts them to an internal display list in order to go through the Rendering.
* Rendering: renders the raster data.
* Screening: screens the raster data.
* ColorSpaceConversion (2): converts the data from the press color model to the proofer device color model.
* Imposition: if imposition proofing is done, combines the pages and marks on the imposed sheets.
* ImageSetting: specifies the actual printing of the proof. Depending on the characteristics of the proofing device DigitalPrinting can be used as well.

The ordering is not completely strict (same result may be achieved with different order combination of steps), but there are some precedence rules: the first color space conversion must be done before the second one, rendering must be done after interpreting, screening in turn must be done after rendering and the second color conversion, ImageSetting/DigitalPrinting must be done after screening.

===Combined processes for soft proofing===
Compared to proofing, since no printed proof is produced, no ImageSetting/DigitalProofing processes are required. Moreover, the rendered data is sent directly to the Approval process that must implement a user interface to show those data on the display and allow him/her to approve/reject the proof and eventually annotate it using digital signature. All the ordering consideration are still valid.

===Considerations on JDF atomic processes===

====ColorSpaceConversion====
In a production workflow with proofing, there must be both the conversion of the input asset color spaces to the press color space and the one of press color space to the proofer color space. So in JDF two different ColorSpaceConversion processes are required and depending on the exact workflow and on the capabilities of the devices, they can be included in the same combined process.

====Interpreting and rendering====
Input data to the proofing combined process usually required both interpreting (with the exception of JDF ByteMap) and rendering. In these cases they will be included in the combined process describing the proofing step.

====Screening====
Two possibilities:
* Proofer can emulate the screening of the press: Screening should be performed once at the ripping combined process and the halftoned data should be sent directly to the proofing combined process.
* Proofer is a &quot;contone proofer&quot;: one Screening process for the press and one for the proofer.

====ImageSetting/Digital Printing====
For printing the proof ImageSetting/DigitalPrinting process has to be specified at the end of the proofing combined process in order to define how the proof is actually printed.

====Approval====
Must be executed before the final production printing can be started.

===HP example: cutting of proofing time===
HP incorporates JDF into its proofing products. Even if it&#x27;s only one step in the total process JDF cuts time from the printing process making printers more efficient because proofing traditional generation and delivery of proofs can take days.

HP sends PDF files to a remote proofing. JDF file enables the inclusion of job information (color profiles, job ticket details...) that is sent to the client. In the future marking up the proof and digital signatures for approval will be implemented.

<doc id="425362" wikidata="Q23062" url="?curid=425362" title="Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions">
<text>The Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions (HKFTU) is a pro-Beijing labour and political group established in 1948 in Hong Kong. It is the oldest and largest labour group in Hong Kong with over 420,000 members in 253 affiliates and associated trade unions. Presided by Ng Chau-pei and chaired by Kingsley Wong, it currently holds four seats in the Legislative Council and 43 seats in the District Councils.

The HKFTU has long been seen as a satellite organisation of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the ruling party of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC). It played a leading role in the 1967 riots against British rule in Hong Kong, which were suppressed by the colonial government. In the 1980s, the HKFTU, along with the conservative business elites, led efforts against faster democratisation during the run up to the Chinese resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997.

HKFTU trade unionists were among the founding members of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB) in 1992, which has become the flagship pro-Beijing party today. In the early 2010s, the HKFTU began actively participating in elections under its own banner with a more pro-grassroots and pro-labour platform, distant from the DAB&#x27;s pro-middle-class and professionals outlook, in order to broaden the pro-Beijing electorate.

==Policies==
The HKFTU&#x27;s motto is &quot;patriotism, solidarity, rights, welfare and participation&quot;. The group focuses on the rights and welfare of workers, supporting workers in their negotiations with employers and helping them resolve labour disputes. It works to amend legislation to protect labour rights and prevent employers from exploiting loopholes in labour laws. It opposes immigrant labour and calls for legislation against age discrimination.

Politically, the HKFTU has been described as left-wing and socialist, but also conversely as pro-business and conservative. It supports the governments of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and is affiliated with the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. It allied with the Hong Kong government on many issues but has a pro-grassroots stance on livelihood and labour issues, such as demanding more measures to reduce unemployment. Due to its government loyalist nature, industrial militancy has been remarkably absent from the HKFTU&#x27;s action programme.

The HKFTU also operates five retail outlets which provide discounted goods and services to its members. Businesses include catering, credit card facilities, medical services, and travel agencies.

==History==

=== Early years ===
The Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions was founded by pro-CCP trade unionists in 1948 as the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions. At the same time, the pro-Kuomintang Hong Kong and Kowloon Trades Union Council (TUC) was set up as a rival organisation. This was all done in the midst of the Chinese Civil War between the Communists and Nationalists in mainland China. The HKFTU was registered as non-union &quot;friendly societies&quot; under the Societies Ordinance in order to avoid the restrictive provision in the newly introduced Trade Union Registration Ordinance of 1948.

During the 1950s and 1960s, the HKFTU functioned as industrially based &quot;friendly societies&quot; or craft-based fraternities and provided benefits and other supplementary aids to the veteran members who was under the threats of unemployment and low pay. It contested with the TUC in industries, trades, and workplaces under the left-right ideological divide of that period.

The relations between the HKFTU and the colonial government remained tense. Union activities were under strict regulation by the government. Inspired by the Cultural Revolution, the HKFTU escalated labour disputes into the 1967 riots against British colonial rule. Many labour activists and HKFTU cadres were imprisoned and deported. Due to its campaign of violence and bomb attacks, the HKFTU suffered serious setbacks in both public esteem and official tolerance. During the riots, the HKFTU also boycotted participation in any officially appointed consultative bodies by the colonial government until Beijing&#x27;s Communist government adopted economic reforms in the late 1970s.

===Transition to 1997===
In the background of the 1980s, amidst shifts in the political economy of mainland China and negotiations on Hong Kong&#x27;s political status after 1997, the HKFTU readjusted its policy toward the colonial government. The electoral reform introduced by the government also gave trade unions access to political power. In the first Legislative Council election in 1985, candidates from the HKFTU and the TUC ran uncontested in the two newly created seats in the Labour functional constituency. One such candidate was Tam Yiu-chung of the HKFTU, who served as the member of the Legislative Council for the Labour functional constituency until 1995, when he was succeeded by Cheng Yiu-tong.

On the other hand, as the most massive grassroots organ of the pro-Beijing bloc, the HKFTU also led efforts to resist the pre-1997 attempts at democratisation. It opposed the possible direct Legislative Council election of 1988 with the slogan, &quot;Hong Kong workers only want meal tickets, not electoral ballots.&quot; However, during the Hong Kong Basic Law drafting process from 1985 to 1990, the HKFTU had to repudiate its demands on the rights to union recognition and collective bargaining in the Consultative and Drafting Committees dominated by tycoons. The HKFTU&#x27;s devotion to Beijing and its collaboration with the conservative business interests were challenged by some leftist unionists.

In the beginning of the 1990s, the HKFTU became more involved in politics to counter the growing influence of pro-democracy parties such as the United Democrats of Hong Kong (later transformed into the Democratic Party) and its ally the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions (HKCTU). Chan Yuen-han ran as the HKFTU candidate in the 1991 Legislative Council direct election but was defeated by Lau Chin-shek, a pro-democracy labour activist representing the United Democrats of Hong Kong. In 1992, the first pro-Beijing political party, the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB), was co-founded by HKFTU members. HKFTU began mobilising its supporters to vote for DAB candidates in the Legislative Council elections.

===Since handover===
After the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997, the HKFTU&#x27;s representatives joined the Beijing-controlled Provisional Legislative Council to roll back several pre-handover labour rights laws passed in spring 1997 by the colonial legislature controlled by the pro-democracy camp, which included the collective bargaining right under the Employee&#x27;s Rights to Representation, Consultation and Collective Bargaining Ordinance. The Provisional Legislative Council also enacted new electoral rules to disenfranchise some 800,000 blue-, gray- and white-collar workers in the nine functional constituencies created from Chris Patten&#x27;s electoral reform. The number of eligible voters in the Labour functional constituency was reduced from 2,001 qualified union officials in 1995 to only 361 unions on a one-vote-per-union basis for the first SAR elections in 1998.

The HKFTU has been a vocal supporter of the central government in Beijing and the Hong Kong SAR government; its then-president Cheng Yiu-tong was appointed as a non-official member of the Executive Council from 2002 to 2017. During the early years of the SAR administration, HKFTU members ran in direct elections under the banner of its sister organisation DAB. Since the 2008 Legislative Council elections, HKFTU members Chan Yuen-han and Wong Kwok-hing have run independently from DAB, under a more grassroots and pro-labour rights agenda. In the 2011 District Council election, the HKFTU ran 20 candidates entirely on its own, winning 11 seats. In the 2012 Legislative Council elections, the HKFTU filled candidates in four of the five geographical constituencies and veteran Chan Yuen-han contested in the territory-wide District Council (Second) constituency, becoming the fourth largest political group in the legislature.

In the 2015 District Council election, the HKFTU had 29 candidates elected (two under both DAB and HKFTU banners). Its Legislative Council seats dropped from six to five in the 2016 Legislative Council election as veteran Wong Kwok-hing failed to retain his District Council (Second) seat. Nevertheless, the HKFTU remained the third-largest political group in the 6th Legislative Council (2016–2021).

The HKFTU suffered a major defeat in the 2019 District Council election, which was held amidst the 2019 protests, retaining only five of their previous 26 seats.

In August 2022, after Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, the HKFTU staged a protest at the US Consulate General in Hong Kong, and said the United States &quot;must pay full responsibility for playing with fire.&quot;

==Finances==
In August 2018, the pro-democracy tabloid &quot;Apple Daily&quot; reported that the HKFTU had total assets of about $250 million Hong Kong dollars. From 2015 to 2017, the HKFTU accumulated an income of $380 million, including $242 million from an unknown donor. The HKFTU also allegedly avoided paying $39.2 million in profits tax by transferring $24.7 million to a company.

In 2020, the port&#x27;s top three trading partners were China (including Hong Kong), Japan, and Vietnam. In 2022, the port, together with the adjoining Port of Long Beach, were considered amongst the world&#x27;s least efficient ports by the World Bank and IHS Markit citing union protectionism and a lack of automation.

==History ==



In 1542, Juan Rodriquez Cabrillo discovered the &quot;Bay of Smokes.&quot; The south-facing San Pedro Bay was originally a shallow mudflat, too soft to support a wharf. Visiting ships had two choices: stay far out at anchor and have their goods and passengers ferried to shore, or beach themselves. That sticky process is described in &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot; by Richard Henry Dana Jr., who was a crew member on an 1834 voyage that visited San Pedro Bay. Phineas Banning greatly improved shipping when he dredged the channel to Wilmington in 1871 to a depth of . The port handled 50,000 tons of shipping that year. Banning owned a stagecoach line with routes connecting San Pedro to Salt Lake City, Utah, and Yuma, Arizona, and in 1868 he built a railroad to connect San Pedro Bay to Los Angeles, the first in the area.

After Banning&#x27;s death in 1885, his sons pursued their interests in promoting the port, which handled 500,000 tons of shipping in that year. The Southern Pacific Railroad and Collis P. Huntington wanted to create Port Los Angeles at Santa Monica and built the Long Wharf there in 1893. However, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; publisher Harrison Gray Otis and U.S. Senator Stephen White pushed for federal support of the Port of Los Angeles at San Pedro Bay. The Free Harbor Fight was settled when San Pedro was endorsed in 1897 by a commission headed by Rear Admiral John C. Walker (who later went on to become the chair of the Isthmian Canal Commission in 1904). With U.S. government support, breakwater construction began in 1899, and the area was annexed to Los Angeles in 1909. The Los Angeles Board of Harbor Commissioners was founded in 1907.

In 1912 the Southern Pacific Railroad completed its first major wharf at the port. During the 1920s, the port surpassed San Francisco as the West Coast&#x27;s busiest seaport. In the early 1930s, a massive expansion of the port was undertaken with the construction of a breakwater three miles out and over two miles in length. In addition to the construction of this outer breakwater, an inner breakwater was built off Terminal Island with docks for seagoing ships and smaller docks built at Long Beach. It was this improved harbor that hosted the sailing events for the 1932 Summer Olympics.

During World War II, the port was primarily used for shipbuilding, employing more than 90,000 people. In 1959, Matson Navigation Company&#x27;s Hawaiian Merchant delivered 20 containers to the port, beginning the port&#x27;s shift to containerization. The opening of the Vincent Thomas Bridge in 1963 greatly improved access to Terminal Island and allowed increased traffic and further expansion of the port. In 1985, the port handled one million containers in a year for the first time. During the 2002 West Coast port labor lockout, the port had a large backlog of ships waiting to be unloaded at any given time. In 2000, the Pier 400 Dredging and Landfill Program, the largest such project in America, was completed. By 2013, more than half a million containers were moving through the Port every month.

==Port district==
The port district is an independent, self-supporting department of the government of the City of Los Angeles. The port is under the control of a five-member Board of Harbor Commissioners appointed by the mayor and approved by the city council, and is administered by an executive director. The port maintains an AA bond rating, the highest rating attainable for self-funded ports.

, the port had about a dozen pilots, including two chiefs. Pilots have specialized knowledge of the harbor and San Pedro Bay. They meet the ships waiting to enter the harbor and provide advice as the vessel is steered through the congested waterway to the dock.

For public safety protection inside the port and of its businesses, the Port of Los Angeles utilizes the Los Angeles Port Police for police service, the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) to provide fire and EMS services, the U.S. Coast Guard for waterway security, Homeland Security to protect federal land at the port, the Los Angeles County Lifeguards to provide lifeguard services for open waters outside of the harbor, while Los Angeles City Recreation &amp; Parks Department lifeguards patrol the inner Cabrillo Beach.

==Shipping==

The port&#x27;s container volume was in calendar year 2019, a 5.5% increase over 2016&#x27;s record-breaking year of 8.8 million TEU. It&#x27;s the most cargo moved annually by a Western Hemisphere port. The port is the busiest port in the United States by container volume, the 19th-busiest container port in the world, and the 10th-busiest worldwide when combined with the neighboring Port of Long Beach. The port is also the number-one freight gateway in the United States when ranked by the value of shipments passing through it. The port&#x27;s top trading partners in 2019 were:
#China/Hong Kong ($128 billion)
#Japan ($89 billion)
#Vietnam ($21 billion)
#South Korea ($15 billion)
#Taiwan ($15 billion)

The most-imported types of goods in the 2019 calendar year were, in order: furniture (579,405), automobile parts (340,546), apparel (312,655), and electronic products (209,622).

The port is served by the Pacific Harbor Line (PHL) railroad. From the PHL, intermodal railroad cars go north to Los Angeles via the Alameda Corridor.

In 2011, no American port could handle ships of the PS-class Emma Mærsk and the future Maersk Triple E class size, the latter of which needs cranes reaching 23 rows. In 2012, the port and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers deepened the port&#x27;s main navigational channel to , which is deep enough to accommodate the draft of the world&#x27;s biggest container ships. However, Maersk had no plans in 2014 to bring those ships to America. In 2024 the port received 3 cranes capable of servicing ships up to 18,000 TEU.

Los Angeles and Long Beach ports were some of the least efficient in the world, according to a 2022 ranking by the World Bank and IHS Markit.

==Cruise ship terminal==
The , located in San Pedro, Los Angeles, beneath the Vincent Thomas Bridge, has three passenger ship berths.

==Public access investments==

The LA Waterfront is a visitor-serving destination in the city of Los Angeles, funded and maintained by the Port of Los Angeles. In 2009, the Los Angeles Harbor Commission approved the San Pedro Waterfront and Wilmington Waterfront development programs, under the LA Waterfront umbrella. The LA Waterfront consists of a series of waterfront development and community enhancement projects covering more than of existing Port of Los Angeles property in both San Pedro and Wilmington. With miles of public promenade and walking paths, acres of open space and scenic views, the LA Waterfront attracts thousands of visitors annually. Remodel and reconstruction was approved by the Los Angeles City Council. Development is set to be completed in 2020. Construction is expected to begin in 2017 at a partial project cost of $90 million, paid by the developer. The San Pedro Public Market is expected to open in 2020, with demolition beginning as early as November 2016.

The Waterfront Red Car is a currently non-operational heritage trolley line for public transit along the waterfront in San Pedro. Prior to its closure in 2015, it used vintage and restored Pacific Electric Red Cars to connect the World Cruise Center, Downtown San Pedro, Ports O&#x27; Call Village, and the San Pedro Marina.

==Environment==
Oceangoing ships visiting ports are a large source of nitrogen oxides in Southern California. Heavy-duty diesel trucks, that are also part of the freight-moving port complexes, emit exhaust with nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. The California Air Resources Board is working on reducing these sources of pollution that produce the nation&#x27;s most polluted air smog and kill more than 3,500 Southern Californians each year. In 2021, the South Coast Air Quality Management District required warehouses in the port which do not cut emissions of carbon and pollutants to pay fees.

The port installed the first Alternative Maritime Power (AMP) berth in 2004 and can provide up to 40 MW of grid power to two cruise ships simultaneously at both 6.6 kV and 11 kV, as well as three container terminals, reducing pollution from ship engines.

In an effort to buffer the nearby community of Wilmington from the port, in June 2011 the Wilmington Waterfront Park was opened.

===Clean Air Action Program===
The $2.8 million San Pedro Bay Ports Clean Air Action Program (CAAP) initiative was implemented by the Board of Harbor Commissioners in October 2002 for terminal and ship operations programs targeted at reducing polluting emissions from vessels and cargo handling equipment . To accelerate implementation of emission reductions through the use of new and cleaner-burning equipment, the port has allocated more than $52 million in additional funding for the CAAP through 2008.

As of May 2016, the Port of Los Angeles has already surpassed its initial 2023 emission goals 8 years ahead of predicted time frame. The dramatic success to reduce emissions has seen a decrease in diesel particulate matter reduce 72%, sulfur oxides by 93%, and nitrogen oxide by 22% so far. The CAAP program was updated to 3.0 after this environmental successes of the initiatives. With the recent ramification of environment goals the updates will look to reduce the emissions through efficient supply chain optimization. There has also been recent developments to increase port technologies advancement to promote the development of efficient and green port technologies. The CAAP also looks to be the lead role caretaker of fostering and improving the wildlife and ecosystem of the port.

<text>The American College, often referred to as American College, is one of the oldest colleges in India, located in Madurai, Tamil Nadu. It was founded in 1881 by American Christian missionaries. The red-brick buildings, in the Saracenic style, blend with the natural surroundings constructed by British architect Henry Irwin. Century-old buildings Main Hall, James Hall and Washburn Hall show the heritage of the college.

The college is ranked 54th among colleges in India by the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) in 2024.

==Location==
It is situated on Melur road (Azhagar Koil road) in between Tamukkam Ground near Tallakulam and Government Rajaji Hospital in Goripalayam.

== History ==

Founded as a missionary in 1841 by the American Mission, the American College became a collegiate department in 1881. It was started initially as Pasumalai College in 1881 under the initiatives of Rev. George T. Washburn, the first principal. He hails from the Great Washburn clan. The college was shifted to its present location during the period of Rev. W.M. Zumbro, its second principal, who had his formal education at University of Michigan, University of Columbia and Yale University, made a proposal in 1903 to the missionary in the United States to shift the college from Pasumalai to Madurai. With more than 130 years of history, the college is remembered for its pioneering role in the cause of college autonomy.

In 1913, it became a first grade college while the first female student was admitted in 1921. The motto verse in the logo of The American College and Washburn University USA are still &quot;Purificatus non consumptus&quot;.

The college was visited by eminent people including Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore who delivered a series of lectures on education in 1919.

The American College Main Hall building was constructed by Henry Irwin (who built the Mysore Palace) and principal G.T. Washburn was influential in getting funds from the US mainly from John D. Rockefeller. The building, to the surprise of people of this generation, was constructed at a cost of ₹52,000. Construction was started in 1898 and was completed in 1904.

Binghamton Hall was raised in 1930 in memory of William Zumbro, who masterminded the construction and landscaping in the college. Contributions from the people of Binghamton city made possible to build the hall of which is the part of Science block.

Lady James Hall is the home for the 100-year-old Chemistry department along with Physics and Zoology department was built by the contributions by Lady Ellen S. James with Robert Chisholm. This is the first science building in Madurai. The seeds for the establishment of the physical sciences department was laid by American missionary Rev. Edgar Martin Flint who served the institution between 1913 and 1943. The two-storey building constructed with bricks and mortar has withstood the time, producing thousands of science students from the southern districts. K.S. Krishnan, one of the co-scientists with Nobel Laureate Sir C. V. Raman, and G Rajasekaran, emeritus professor involved in India-based Neutrino Observatory project, are notable alumni of the college and went through the Hall. Seven of the alumni, who studied science in the Hall, later rose to receive the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology.

Daniel Poor Memorial Library in Madurai often abbreviated as DPM Library is the central library of The American College It is one of the oldest libraries in South India. DPM officially began its functions on 28 June 1915. It is named in memory of Rev. Daniel Poor who was one of the pioneer missionaries who started the American Ceylon Mission in Jaffna in 1816. The Jubilee Chapel was dedicated in 1931 in commemoration of golden jubilee celebrations. The name Jubilee was adopted from the White Chapel of Senusret I.

Rabindranath Tagore gave public lectures in the year 1919 in the Main Hall and collected ₹2,365 out of which he took ₹2,000 for Visva-Bharati University, Shantiniketan and gave ₹365 for starting an endowment in American College. Georges Clemenceau who led France in the First World War delivered lectures in Main Hall and contributed the college.

The college was one of the first set of seven colleges to be made autonomous by the UGC in 1977. The first college to introduce &quot;Campus Inn&quot; hostel system was named after Washburn. Today the college offers 18n undergraduate and 13 postgraduate programmes. There are research centres offering M.Phil. and Ph.D. programme. There are other autonomous centres like Department of Applied Sciences (DAS) and The first college to introduce CBCS system and Student foreign exchange programme (Study abroad) in India.

The postgraduate Department of Social Work was added in 1998. The college has theater groups, social service schemes and NCC units that offer students opportunities to serve society. This college is known for its focus on academic excellence.

Love in the early 1980s to show how important Indian literature in English had become. ‘English Literature’ no longer means just the literature of England. SCILET facilitates the translation of regional language writing into English, so that literature written in such aboriginal languages as Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada and Telugu can be read in all parts of the country. Love&#x27;s teaching in India, which began with his appointment to overseas service with the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) in 1954, was interrupted periods of study and teaching. SCILET sponsors activities such as lectures, seminars and poetry readings that present some of the best of these writers in person, enabling teachers, students and the research community to interact and become acquainted with them. To further the cause of Indian literature in English, SCILET has developed several publications, the best known of which is its annual poetry journal, &quot;Kavya Bharati&quot;, which includes in equal amount the work of established Indian poets and promising new voices.

<doc id="425371" wikidata="Q2415562" url="?curid=425371" title="Rama II (novel)">
<text>Rama II is a science fiction novel by Gentry Lee and Arthur C. Clarke, first published in 1989. It recounts humankind&#x27;s further interaction with the Ramans, first introduced in &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot;. Written primarily by Lee, &quot;Rama II&quot; has a distinctly different writing style than the original, with a more character-driven narrative and a closer-to-contemporary mindset, ambience and human relations than the first novel&#x27;s more futuristic tones.
&quot;Rama II&quot; is the first novel of the &quot;new&quot; &quot;Rama&quot; series, as &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot; is not always counted as part of it. The &quot;Rama&quot; series includes two more sequels: &quot;The Garden of Rama&quot; and &quot;Rama Revealed&quot;.

==Plot summary==

Seventy years after the events of &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot;, a second Raman vessel enters the Solar System. Its arrival is expected, and on Earth the chosen crew of twelve readies for the voyage to unlock more of Rama&#x27;s mysteries. Interpersonal conflicts among crew members begin prior to the launch date.

After arriving, an accident kills the leader of the group while still outside Rama, and there is debate over who the replacement should be. The tools and vehicles the crew bring to Rama, based on knowledge from the first expedition, make exploring Rama easier.

The novel ends with three of the twelve astronauts abandoned inside Rama as it travels out of the Solar System.

<doc id="425375" wikidata="Q729694" url="?curid=425375" title="Jack Phillips (wireless operator)">
<text>John George &quot;Jack&quot; Phillips (11 April 1887 – 15 April 1912) was a British sailor and the senior wireless operator aboard the &quot;Titanic&quot; during her ill-fated maiden voyage in April 1912.

Before the collision with the iceberg, Phillips and his assistant, Harold Bride, had acknowledged and passed along several ice warnings to the bridge. As the ship sank, Phillips did his utmost to contact other ships for assistance and coordinated a successful rescue effort with the . He did not survive the sinking and his body, if recovered, was not identified.

==Early life==
Phillips was born on 11 April 1887 in Farncombe, Surrey. The son of George Alfred Phillips, a draper and Ann Phillips (née Sanders), Phillips&#x27; family originally came from Trowbridge, Wiltshire, from a lineage of weavers, but moved to Farncombe around 1883. Phillips lived with his five siblings, of whom only two twin sisters survived to adulthood, above a draper&#x27;s shop – Gammons – which his father managed in Farncombe Street. Educated at a private school on Hare Lane, then St John Street School, Phillips sang as a choirboy at St John the Evangelist – Farncombe&#x27;s church.

He finished school in 1902 and began working at the Godalming post office, where he learned telegraphy. He started training to work in wireless for the Marconi Company in March 1906, in Seaforth, and graduated five months later in August. Phillips&#x27;s first assignment was on the White Star Line ship . He later worked on board Cunard&#x27;s ; the Allan Line&#x27;s &quot;Corsican&quot;, &quot;Pretorian&quot; and ; and then Cunard&#x27;s and . In May 1908, he was assigned to the Marconi station outside Clifden, Ireland, where he worked until 1911, when he was assigned to the and later, in early 1912, to the .

==RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;==
In March 1912, Phillips was sent to Belfast, Ireland, to be the senior wireless operator on board &quot;Titanic&quot; for her maiden voyage. He was joined by junior wireless operator Harold Bride. Stories have appeared that Phillips knew Bride before &quot;Titanic&quot;, but Bride insisted they had never met before Belfast. &quot;Titanic&quot; sailed for New York City, United States, from Southampton, England, on 10 April 1912, and during the voyage Phillips and Bride transmitted passengers&#x27; personal messages and received iceberg warnings and other navigational information from other ships. Phillips celebrated his 25th birthday the day after the voyage began.

On the evening of 14 April, in the wireless room on the boat deck, Phillips was sending messages to Cape Race, Newfoundland, working to clear a backlog of passengers&#x27; personal messages that had accumulated when the wireless had broken down the day before. Bride was asleep in the adjoining cabin, intending to relieve Phillips at midnight, two hours early. Shortly after 21:30, Phillips received an ice warning from the steamship &quot;Mesaba&quot; reporting drifting ice, a large number of icebergs, and an ice field directly in &quot;Titanic&quot;″s path in the area of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. Phillips acknowledged &quot;Mesaba&quot;″s warning and continued to transmit messages to Cape Race. The wireless operator on the , waited for Phillips to report that he had given the report to the bridge, but Phillips continued working Cape Race.

At 22:55, Phillips was again interrupted by another ship, this time the . Cyril Evans, the only wireless operator on board the &quot;Californian&quot;, was reporting that they were stopped and surrounded by ice. &quot;Californian&quot;″s relative proximity, and the fact that both Evans and Phillips were using spark-gap wireless sets whose signals bled across the spectrum and were impossible to tune out, meant that Evans&#x27;s signal was strong and loud in Phillips&#x27;s ears, while the signals from Cape Race were faint to Phillips and inaudible to Evans. Phillips quickly sent back, &quot;Keep out; shut up, I&#x27;m working Cape Race&quot;, and continued communicating with Cape Race, while Evans listened a while longer before going to bed for the night.

Though some have argued that that these two communications led to the failure of the iceberg being spotted, several ice warnings from other ships had already been received and communicated to Captain Edward Smith on the bridge – including an earlier one from the &quot;Californian&quot; – so he was aware that there was ice in the area before the warnings of &quot;Mesaba&quot; and &quot;Californian&quot; came in, and two lookouts were posted for that night. Additionally, Phillips&#x27; supposedly dismissive language was part of the straight jargon used by wireless operators and Evans did not ask Phillips to forward the &quot;Californian&quot;″s position to the bridge as it was not an official ice warning; at the British Wreck Commissioner&#x27;s inquiry, Evans told the Viscount Mersey that the comment was not meant as and nor perceived as an insult:

Phillips, along with Bride, had also spent most of the night before repairing the wireless machine, which had broken down the day before, against Marconi Company guidelines which stated that operators should not repair the machine lest they get further damaged. Phillips&#x27; repairs made it possible to coordinate a rescue effort for survivors after the ship sank.

&quot;Titanic&quot; struck an iceberg at 23:40 that night and began sinking. Bride had woken up and begun getting ready to relieve Phillips when Captain Edward Smith entered the wireless room and told Phillips to prepare to send out a distress signal. Shortly after midnight, Captain Smith came in again and told them to send out the call for assistance and gave them &quot;Titanic&quot;″s estimated position. Phillips began sending out the distress signal, code CQD, while Bride took messages to Captain Smith about which ships were coming to &quot;Titanic&quot;″s assistance. At one point, Bride half-jokingly told Phillips that the new call was SOS and said, &quot;Send S.O.S., it&#x27;s the new call, and it may be your last chance to send it.&quot; Phillips was able to contact the which headed for the scene.

After taking a quick break, Phillips returned to the wireless room and reported to Bride that the forward part of the ship was flooded, and they should put on more clothes and lifebelts. Bride began to get ready, while Phillips went back to work on the wireless machine.

The wireless power was almost completely out shortly after 02:00, when Captain Smith arrived and told the men they had done their duty and were relieved. Bride later remembered being moved by the way Phillips continued working. While their backs were turned, a crew member (either a stoker or trimmer) sneaked in and attempted to steal Phillips&#x27;s lifebelt. Bride, outraged at the man&#x27;s behaviour, attacked the man and might have hit him with an object. The water was beginning to flood the wireless room as they both ran out of the wireless room, leaving the motionless crewman where he fell. The men then split up, Bride heading forward and Phillips heading aft. This was the last time Bride saw Phillips.

===Death===
Conflicting and contradictory information led to popular belief that Phillips possibly managed to make it to the overturned Collapsible B, which was in the charge of Second Officer Charles Lightoller, along with Harold Bride but did not last the night. In his &quot;The New York Times&quot; interview, Bride said that a man from boat B was dead, and that as he boarded the &quot;Carpathia&quot;, he saw that the dead man was Phillips. However, when testifying in the Senate Inquiry, Bride changed his story, saying that he had only been told that Phillips died on Collapsible B, and was later buried at sea from &quot;Carpathia&quot; and had not witnessed this for himself.

In his book, Colonel Archibald Gracie said a body was transferred from the collapsible onto boat #12 but said that the body was definitely not that of Phillips. He reported that when speaking with Charles Lightoller, the Second Officer agreed with him that the body was not Phillips. In Lightoller&#x27;s testimony at the United States Senate inquiry into the sinking of the Titanic, he says that Bride told him that Phillips had been aboard and died on the boat, but it is clear that Lightoller never saw this for himself. In Lightoller&#x27;s 1935 autobiography, &quot;Titanic and Other Ships&quot;, he writes that Phillips was aboard Collapsible B and told everyone the position of the various ships they had contacted by wireless, and when they could expect a rescue, before succumbing to the cold and dying. He also claims that Phillips&#x27; body was taken aboard Boat No. 12 at his insistence.

It is clear from Gracie and other 1912 evidence that the man on the upturned collapsible who called out the names of approaching ships was Harold Bride, not Jack Phillips, as Lightoller thought in 1935. Lightoller&#x27;s 1912 testimony contradicts his 1935 statements that he saw Phillips aboard B and that the body taken off the boat was Phillips. Salon Steward Thomas Whiteley may have been Bride&#x27;s source for the story; in a press interview, Whiteley claimed that Phillips had been aboard the collapsible, died and was taken aboard &quot;Carpathia&quot;; as no other witness in 1912 claimed Phillips&#x27; body was recovered, and his name was never mentioned by any source aboard &quot;Carpathia&quot; as being one of the four bodies buried at sea, it is possible that Whiteley was simply mistaken in his identification, or that if Phillips had been aboard Collapsible B, his body was not recovered.

==Legacy==
There are memorials to Phillips in Nightingale Cemetery, Farncombe and in the Phillips Memorial Cloister, part of the Phillips Memorial Ground, which lies to the north of the Church of St Peter &amp; St Paul, Godalming. The cloister was designed by architect Hugh Thackeray Turner while the gardens inside and around it was designed by horticulturist Gertrude Jekyll. In 2012, marking the 100th anniversary of the sinking, the Cloister and grounds were renovated.

On 11 April 2017, on what would have been his 130th birthday, the Godalming Town Council unveiled a blue plaque at Phillips&#x27; birthplace.

<doc id="425379" wikidata="Q76418" url="?curid=425379" title="Earwax">
<text>Earwax, also known by the medical term cerumen, is a waxy substance secreted in the ear canal of humans and other mammals. Earwax can be many colors, including brown, orange, red, yellowish, and gray. Earwax protects the skin of the human ear canal, assists in cleaning and lubrication, and provides protection against bacteria, fungi, particulate matter, and water.

Major components of earwax include cerumen, produced by a type of modified sweat gland, and sebum, an oily substance. Both components are made by glands located in the outer ear canal. The chemical composition of earwax includes saturated and unsaturated long chain fatty acids, alcohols, squalene, and cholesterol. Earwax also contains dead skin cells and hair.

Excess or compacted cerumen is the buildup of ear wax causing a blockage in the ear canal and it can press against the eardrum or block the outside ear canal or hearing aids, potentially causing hearing loss.

==Physiology==

Cerumen is produced in the cartilaginous outer third portion of the ear canal. It is a mixture of secretions from sebaceous glands and less-viscous ones from modified apocrine sweat glands. The primary components of both wet and dry earwax are shed layers of skin, with, on average, 60% of the earwax consisting of keratin, 12–20% saturated and unsaturated long-chain fatty acids, alcohols, squalene and 6–9% cholesterol.

===Wet or dry===

There are two genetically-determined types of earwax: the wet type, which is dominant, and the dry type, which is recessive. This distinction is caused by a single base change in the &quot;ATP-binding cassette C11 gene&quot;. Dry-type individuals are homozygous for adenine (AA) whereas wet-type requires at least one guanine (AG or GG). Dry earwax is gray or tan and brittle, and is about 20% lipid. It has a smaller concentration of lipid and pigment granules than wet earwax. Wet earwax is light brown or dark brown and has a viscous and sticky consistency, and is about 50% lipid. Wet-type earwax is associated with armpit odor, which is increased by sweat production.

Some East Asians (including Yamato Japanese), Southeast Asians and Native Americans (including Inuit) are more likely to have the dry type of earwax (gray and flaky), while Africans, Europeans, and other East Asians (including Ainu) are more likely to have wet type earwax (honey-brown, dark orange to dark-brown and moist). 30–50% of South Asians, Central Asians and Pacific Islanders have the dry type of cerumen.

===Cleaning===

Cleaning of the ear canal occurs as a result of the &quot;conveyor belt&quot; process of epithelial migration, aided by jaw movement. From the umbo, cells formed in the center of the tympanic membrane move to the walls of the ear canal, and then towards the entrance of the ear canal. The cerumen in the ear canal is also carried outwards, taking with it particulate matter that may have gathered in the canal. Jaw movement dislodges debris from the walls of the ear canal to assist in this process.

Removing earwax is in the scope of practice for nurses, audiologists, Family Medicine physicians, and otorhinolaryngologists (ear, nose, and throat doctors).

===Lubrication===

The lubrication provided by cerumen prevents drying of the skin within the ear canal. The high lipid content of the sebum produced by the sebaceous glands causes the cerumen to work like lubrication. In wet-type cerumen, these lipids include cholesterol, squalene, and many long-chain fatty acids and alcohols.

===Antimicrobial effects===

While studies conducted up until the 1960s found little evidence supporting antibacterial activity for cerumen, more recent studies have found that cerumen has a bactericidal effect on some strains of bacteria. Cerumen has been found to reduce the viability of a wide range of bacteria, including &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;, &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, and many variants of &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, sometimes by as much as 99%. The growth of two fungi commonly present in otomycosis was also significantly inhibited by human cerumen. These antimicrobial properties are due principally to the presence of saturated fatty acids, lysozyme and, especially, to the slight acidity of cerumen (pH typically around 6.1 in average individuals). Conversely, other research has found that cerumen can support microbial growth and some cerumen samples were found to have bacterial counts as high as 107/g cerumen. The bacteria were predominantly commensals.

==Excess earwax (impacted cerumen)==

Earwax helps protect the ear by trapping dust and other foreign particles that could filter through and damage the eardrum. Normally, earwax moves toward the opening of the ear and falls out or is washed away, but sometimes excessive earwax can gather and become hard to remove. This is referred to as excessive earwax or impacted cerumen.

Excessive earwax may impede the passage of sound in the ear canal, causing mild conductive hearing loss, pain in the ear, itchiness, or dizziness. Untreated impacted wax can result in hearing loss, social withdrawal, poor work function, and mild paranoia. People with impacted wax may also present with perforated eardrums; this is usually induced by putting objects in the ear in an attempt to remove the wax. A physical exam usually checks for visibility of the tympanic membrane, which can be blocked by excessive cerumen.

Impacted cerumen may improve on its own, but treatment by a doctor is generally safe and effective. Hearing usually returns completely after the impacted earwax is removed.

Hearing aids may be associated with increased earwax impaction by blocking earwax from leaving the ear canal. Earwax can also get into a hearing aid&#x27;s vents and receivers, and degrades the components inside the hearing aid due to its acidity. Earwax is estimated to be the cause of 60–80% of hearing aid faults. Excessive earwax can also cause tinnitus, a constant ringing in the ears, ear fullness, hearing loss and ear pain.

Impacted earwax is more common in those with Down&#x27;s syndrome, due to the smaller, curved shape of the ear canal.

===Treatment=== 
Movement of the jaw helps the ears&#x27; natural cleaning process. The American Academy of Otolaryngology discourages earwax removal, unless the excess earwax is symptomatic.

While a number of methods of earwax removal are effective, their comparative merits have not been determined. A number of softeners are effective; however, if this is not sufficient, the most common method of cerumen removal is syringing with warm water. A curette method is more likely to be used by audiologists and otolaryngologists when the ear canal is partially occluded and the material is not adhering to the skin of the ear canal, but due to the high skill level needed to not damage the eardrum, is limited. Cotton swabs are not recommended as they push most of the earwax farther into the ear canal and remove only a small portion of the top layer of wax that happens to adhere to the fibers of the swab.

====Softeners====
This process is referred to as &quot;cerumenolysis&quot;. Topical preparations for the removal of earwax may be better than no treatment, and there may not be much difference between types, including water and olive oil. However, there were not enough studies to draw firm conclusions, and the evidence on irrigation and manual removal is equivocal.

Commercially or commonly available cerumenolytics include:
* Any of a number of types of oil
* Urea hydrogen peroxide (6.5%) and glycerine
* A solution of sodium bicarbonate in water, or sodium bicarbonate B.P.C. (sodium bicarbonate and glycerine)
* Cerumol (peanut oil, turpentine and dichlorobenzene)
* Cerumenex (triethanolamine, polypeptides and oleate-condensate)
* Docusate, an emulsifying agent, an active ingredient found in laxatives
* Mineral oil

A cerumenolytic should be used 2–3 times daily for 3–5 days prior to the cerumen extraction.

====Microsuction====

Microsuction involves the use of a vacuum suction probe to break up and extract impacted cerumen. Microsuction can be preferred over other methods as it avoids the presence of moisture in the ear, is often faster than irrigation, and is performed with direct vision of the earwax being removed. Typically, a camera with lights and guide hole is utilised, with a long metal vacuum probe being inserted into the guide hole - the practitioner is then able to see inside the ear and remove earwax under pressure. Potential adverse effects include dizziness, temporary tinnitus, and reduced hearing due to volume of the pump and the proximity of the vacuum probe to the ear drum - the frequency of these are reduced where the cerumen is softened in the five days preceding microsuction. In general, microsuction is well tolerated and even preferred by many patients.

====Ear irrigation====

Once the cerumen has been softened, it may be removed from the ear canal by irrigation, but the evidence on this practice is ambiguous. If a patient has a perforated eardrum, syringing can force infections into the middle ear, and residual water can cause an infection in the outer ear.

This may be effectively accomplished with a spray type ear washer, commonly used in the medical setting or at home, with a bulb syringe. Ear syringing techniques are described in great detail by Wilson &amp; Roeser and Blake et al. who advise pulling the external ear up and back, and aiming the nozzle of the syringe slightly upwards and backwards so that the water flows as a cascade along the roof of the canal. The irrigation solution flows out of the canal along its floor, taking wax and debris with it. The solution used to irrigate the ear canal is usually warm water, normal saline, sodium bicarbonate solution, or a solution of water and vinegar to help prevent secondary infection.

Affected people generally prefer the irrigation solution to be warmed to body temperature, as dizziness is a common side effect of ear washing or syringing with fluids that are colder or warmer than body temperature.

====Mechanical removal using a curette or cotton swabs====

Earwax can be removed with an ear pick or curette, which physically dislodges the earwax and scoops it out of the ear canal. In the West, use of ear picks is usually only done by health professionals. Curetting earwax using an ear pick was common in ancient Europe and is still practised in East Asia. Since the earwax of most Asians is of the dry type, it is extremely easily removed by light scraping with an ear pick, as it simply falls out in large pieces or dry flakes. 

In the late 2010s, battery-operated &#x27;smart&#x27; curette earwax removal devices were introduced to the commercial personal grooming market. These endoscope-like devices are roughly the size and shape of a thick ballpoint pen, combining a miniature digital video camera, LED light source, Wi-Fi connectivity, and various earwax removal attachments. Patients could then connect this electronic curette device to a mobile app on their smartphone and view a real-time video feed of the curette in the ear canal. With practice and careful technique, the device enables patients to inspect their own ear canals and remove excess earwax while also visualizing the tympanic membrane. However, the risks of accidentally breaking the delicate skin within the ear canal or perforating the eardrum remain concerns. 

It is generally advised not to use cotton swabs (Q-Tips or cotton buds), as doing so will likely push the wax farther down the ear canal, and if used carelessly, perforate the eardrum. Abrasion of the ear canal, particularly after water has entered from swimming or bathing, can lead to ear infection. Also, the cotton head may fall off and become lodged in the ear canal. Therefore, cotton swabs should be used only to clean the external ear.

====Ear candles====
Ear candling is a dangerous, ineffective, and counterproductive alternative medicine practice that involves lighting a hollow candle and placing the unlit end in the ear canal. Advocates say that the dark residue appearing on the candle after the procedure consists of extracted earwax, but studies show that the same dark residue is left regardless of whether the candle is inserted into an ear, as the residue is derived from the candle itself and not the ear. The American Academy of Otolaryngology states that ear candles are not a safe option for removing ear wax, and that no controlled studies or scientific evidence support their use for ear wax removal. Survey responses from medical specialists (otolaryngologists) in the United Kingdom reported ear injuries including burns, ear canal occlusions and ear drum perforations and secondary ear canal infections with temporary hearing loss from ear candling. The Food and Drug Administration has taken several regulatory actions against the sale and distribution of ear candles since 1996, including seizing ear candle products and ordering injunctions, and ear candles are now marked as &quot;providing no health benefit&quot;.

Ear vacuuming

Home &quot;ear vacs&quot; were ineffective at removing ear-wax when compared to a Jobson-Horne probe.

====Potential complications====

A postal survey of British general practitioners found that only 19% always performed cerumen removal themselves. It is problematic as the removal of cerumen is not without risk, and physicians and nurses often have inadequate training for removal. Irrigation can be performed at home with proper equipment as long as the person is careful not to irrigate too hard. All other methods should be carried out only by individuals who have been sufficiently trained in the procedure.

The author Bull advised physicians: &quot;After removal of wax, inspect thoroughly to make sure none remains. This advice might seem superfluous, but is frequently ignored.&quot; This was confirmed by Sharp et al., who, in a survey of 320 general practitioners, found that only 68% of doctors inspected the ear canal after syringing to check that the wax was removed. As a result, failure to remove the wax from the canal made up approximately 30% of the complications associated with the procedure. Other complications included otitis externa (swimmer&#x27;s ear), which involves inflammation or bacterial infection of the external acoustic meatus, as well as pain, vertigo, tinnitus, and perforation of the ear drum. Based on this study, a rate of major complications in 1/1000 ears syringed was suggested.

Claims arising from ear syringing mishaps account for about 25% of the total claims received by New Zealand&#x27;s Accident Compensation Corporation ENT Medical Misadventure Committee. While high, this is not surprising, as ear syringing is an extremely common procedure. Grossan suggested that approximately 150,000 ears are irrigated each week in the United States, and about 40,000 per week in the United Kingdom. Extrapolating from data obtained in Edinburgh, Sharp et al. place this figure much higher, estimating that approximately 7000 ears are syringed per 100,000 population per annum. In the New Zealand claims mentioned above, perforation of the tympanic membrane was by far the most common injury resulting in significant disability.

===Prevalence===

The prevalence of impacted earwax is different across the world.

In the United Kingdom 2 to 6% of the population have cerumen that is impacted. In America 3.6% of emergency visits caused by ear issues were due to impacted cerumen. In Brazil 8.4–13.7% of the population have impacted cerumen.

==History==

The treatment of excess ear wax was described by Aulus Cornelius Celsus in &quot;De Medicina&quot; in the 1st century:

===Uses===
*In medieval Europe, earwax and other substances such as urine were used to prepare pigments used by scribes to illustrate illuminated manuscripts.
*Pliny the Elder, in his &quot;Natural History&quot;, wrote that earwax—when applied topically—cured bites from humans, scorpions, and serpents; it was said to work best when taken from the ears of the wounded person himself.
*Early American lip balms may have been based on earwax. The 1832 edition of the &quot;American Frugal Housewife&quot; said that &quot;nothing was better than earwax to prevent the painful effects resulting from a wound by a nail [or] skewer&quot;; and also recommended earwax as a remedy for cracked lips. 
*Before waxed thread was commonly available, a seamstress would use her own earwax to stop the cut ends of threads from fraying.
*Earwax retains concentrations of cortisol over time. As cortisol levels change throughout the day and increase in response to stress, long-term measurements are difficult yet necessary. A 2020 study suggests swabbing earwax as a method of measuring long-term cortisol levels that is noninvasive and does not confound itself.

<text>Patricia Smith Churchland (born 16 July 1943) is a Canadian-American analytic philosopher noted for her contributions to neurophilosophy and the philosophy of mind. She is UC President&#x27;s Professor of Philosophy Emerita at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), where she has taught since 1984. She has also held an adjunct professorship at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies since 1989. She is a member of the Board of Trustees Moscow Center for Consciousness Studies of Philosophy Department, Moscow State University. In 2015, she was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences. Educated at the University of British Columbia, the University of Pittsburgh, and Somerville College, Oxford, she taught philosophy at the University of Manitoba from 1969 to 1984 and is married to the philosopher Paul Churchland. Larissa MacFarquhar, writing for &quot;The New Yorker,&quot; observed of the philosophical couple that: &quot;Their work is so similar that they are sometimes discussed, in journals and books, as one person.&quot;

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Churchland was born Patricia Smith in Oliver, British Columbia, and raised on a farm in the South Okanagan valley. Both of her parents lacked a high-school education; her father and mother left school after grades 6 and 8 respectively. Her mother was a nurse and her father worked in newspaper publishing in addition to running the family farm. In spite of their limited education, Churchland has described her parents as interested in the sciences, and the worldview they instilled in her as a secular one. She has also described her parents as eager for her to attend college, and though many farmers in their community thought this &quot;hilarious and a grotesque waste of money&quot;, they saw to it that she did so. She took her undergraduate degree at the University of British Columbia, graduating with honors in 1965. She received a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship to study at the University of Pittsburgh, where she took an M.A. in 1966. Thereafter she studied at Somerville College, Oxford as a British Council and Canada Council Fellow, obtaining a B. Phil in 1969.

===Academic career===
Churchland&#x27;s first academic appointment was at the University of Manitoba, where she was an assistant professor from 1969 to 1977, an associate professor from 1977 to 1982, and promoted to a full professorship in 1983. It was here that she began to make a formal study of neuroscience with the help and encouragement of Larry Jordan, a professor with a lab in the Department of Physiology there. From 1982 to 1983 she was a Visiting Member in Social Science at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. In 1984, she was invited to take up a professorship in the department of philosophy at UCSD, and relocated there with her husband Paul, where both have remained since. Since 1989, she has also held an adjunct professorship at the Salk Institute adjacent to UCSD&#x27;s campus, where she became acquainted with Jonas Salk whose name the Institute bears. Describing Salk, Churchland has said that he &quot;liked the idea of neurophilosophy, and he gave me a tremendous amount of encouragement at a time when many other people thought that we were, frankly, out to lunch.&quot; Another important supporter Churchland found at the Salk Institute was Francis Crick. At the Salk Institute, Churchland has worked with Terrence Sejnowski&#x27;s lab as a research collaborator. Her collaboration with Sejnowski culminated in a book, &quot;The Computational Brain&quot; (MIT Press, 1993), co-authored with Sejnowski. Churchland was named the UC President&#x27;s Professor of Philosophy in 1999, and served as Chair of the Philosophy Department at UCSD from 2000-2007.

She attended and was a speaker at the secularist Beyond Belief symposia in 2006, 2007, and 2008.

===Personal life===

Churchland first met her husband, the philosopher Paul Churchland, while they were both enrolled in a class on Plato at the University of Pittsburgh, and they were married after she completed her B.Phil at Somerville College, Oxford. Their children are Mark M. Churchland (born 1972) and Anne K. Churchland (born 1974), both of whom are neuroscientists. Churchland is considered an atheist, but she identified herself as pantheist in a 2012 interview.

==Philosophical work==
Churchland is broadly allied to a view of philosophy as a kind of &#x27;proto-science&#x27; - asking challenging but largely empirical questions. She advocates the scientific endeavour, and has dismissed significant swathes of professional philosophy as obsessed with what she regards as unnecessary.

Churchland&#x27;s own work has focused on the interface between neuroscience and philosophy. According to her, philosophers are increasingly realizing that to understand the mind one must understand the brain. She applies findings from neuroscience to address traditional philosophical questions about knowledge, free will, consciousness and ethics. She is associated with a school of thought called eliminative materialism, which argues that common sense, immediately intuitive, or &quot;folk psychological&quot; concepts such as thought, free will, and consciousness will likely need to be revised in a physically reductionistic way as neuroscientists discover more about the nature of brain function.
2014 saw a brief exchange of views on these topics with Colin McGinn in the pages of the &quot;New York Review Of Books&quot;.

<doc id="425386" wikidata="Q440141" url="?curid=425386" title="Marthinus Wessel Pretorius">
<text>Marthinus Wessel Pretorius (17 September 1819 – 19 May 1901) was a South African political leader. An Afrikaner (or &quot;Boer&quot;), he helped establish the South African Republic (&quot;Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek&quot; or ZAR; also referred to as Transvaal), was the first president of the ZAR, and also compiled its constitution.

He was born in Cape Colony, then accompanied his father, the Voortrekker leader Andries Pretorius in the migration to the interior.
After the death of his father in 1853, he was appointed to succeed him as Commandant-General of the Boer settlers around the city of Potchefstroom and moved from his farm, Kalkheuwel, near Broederstroom, to Potchefstroom. He was Commandant-General of Potchefstroom from 1853 through 1856.

== Political offices ==
In 1857, the nascent ZAR elected Pretorius as its first President. However, in 1859, in an effort to create closer bonds with the Orange Free State, he also became State President of the Orange Free State. This created tension in the ZAR, and in 1860, he resigned as President of the ZAR. After serving as President of the Orange Free State until 1863, Pretorius was re-elected President of the ZAR in 1864, and served a second term until 1871. Pretorius also served as joint head of state (in the &quot;triumvirate&quot;) between 1880 and 1883.

He died on 19 May 1901 at Potchefstroom.

Pretorius was an important South African Freemason.

== Founding of the city of Pretoria ==
In an endeavour to establish a new town, he bought two farms named Elandspoort and Daspoort between 1854 and 1855, on which he founded the city of Pretoria in 1855.

Ds. van der Hoff originally named the first church congregation in this area Pretoria Philadelphia (Pretorius Friendship), in honour of Pretorius&#x27; father. Later, the town took on the shortened name of Pretoria.

Five years later the capital of the ZAR was moved from Potchefstroom to Pretoria.

<doc id="425387" wikidata="Q759559" url="?curid=425387" title="Prelude to Space">
<text>Prelude to Space is a science fiction novel written by British author Arthur C. Clarke in 1947. It appeared for the first time in 1951 as a paperback from World Editions Inc, as number three in its series of Galaxy novels. Sidgwick &amp; Jackson published it in the UK in 1953, followed the next year by a United States hardcover edition from Gnome Press and a paperback from Ballantine Books.

==Plot summary==
&quot;Prelude to Space&quot; recounts the fictional events leading up the launch of &quot;Prometheus&quot;, the world&#x27;s first spacecraft capable of reaching the Moon. &quot;Prometheus&quot; consists of two components, named Alpha and Beta. Alpha is designed for travel from Earth orbit to the Moon and back. It is not capable of independent atmospheric flight. Beta is a nuclear-powered flying wing which carries Alpha into orbit. Beta uses a nuclear reactor to superheat either air (when flying in the lower, denser, part of the atmosphere) or its own internal supply of methane (in the higher reaches of the atmosphere and in space) to achieve thrust. Beta functions as a ramjet in the lower atmosphere and must be launched using an electric launch track. The return journey to the Moon proceeds as follows: Beta carries Alpha into orbit; Alpha separates from Beta and refuels from tanks previously carried into orbit by Beta; Alpha flies to and lands on the Moon while Beta remains in Earth orbit; Alpha returns to Earth orbit and the crew returns to Earth aboard Beta; Alpha remains in orbit to await the next flight.

&quot;Prelude&quot; was written before the Apollo program landed men on the Moon and follows the ideal that space travel is realistic and within the grasp of the population. Clarke wrote a new preface in 1976 in which he admits that he had some propagandist goals in writing &quot;Prelude to Space&quot; — he was an influential member of the astronautics community when the idea of rockets leaving Earth&#x27;s atmosphere was scoffed at by many scientists.

The novel ends with the launching of &quot;Prometheus&quot;; the entire plot consists of scientists, engineers and administrators showing Dr. Dirk Alexson how the mission was planned and how the technology will work. Dr. Alexson is the historian assigned to prepare the official history of the Moon mission.

&quot;Prelude to Space&quot; has also been published under the titles &quot;Master of Space&quot; and &quot;The Space Dreamers&quot;.

==Reception==
Groff Conklin characterized &quot;Prelude&quot; as a &quot;genuinely effective &#x27;documentary of tomorrow&#x27;&quot;. Boucher and McComas praised the novel, saying that Clarke handled scientific detail &quot;with so sensitive a poetic understanding that this simple factual narrative is more absorbing than the most elaborately plotted galactic epic.&quot; P. Schuyler Miller reviewed it favorably, citing its &quot;documentary quality&quot; and &quot;many of the poetic bits&quot; that mark Clarke&#x27;s work.

<text>Andries Wilhelmus Jacobus Pretorius (27 November 179823 July 1853) was a leader of the Boers who was instrumental in the creation of the South African Republic, as well as the earlier but short-lived Natalia Republic, in present-day South Africa. The large city of Pretoria, executive capital of South Africa, is named after him.

==Early life and background ==
Pretorius was educated at home and although a school education was not a priority on the eastern frontier of the Cape Colony, he was literate enough to read the Bible and write his thoughts down on paper. Pretorius had five children, the eldest of whom, Marthinus Wessel Pretorius, later became the first President of the South African Republic (Transvaal).

Pretorius descended from the line of the earliest Dutch settlers in the Cape Colony. He belonged to the fifth generation of the progenitor, Johannes Pretorius son of Reverend Wessel Schulte of the Netherlands. Schulte in his time as a theology student at the University of Leiden changed his name to the Latin form and therefore became Wesselius Praetorius (later Pretorius).

Although the details of Andries Pretorius&#x27; early life are scant, it is most likely that he grew up on his father&#x27;s farm named Driekoppen, about 40 kilometres north-east of Graaff-Reinet.

==Career==
In September 1839, after the up company of Gerrit Maritz left Graaff-Reinet to go northwards, those that stayed behind including Pretorius began to strongly consider leaving the Cape Colony. He left his home in October 1837 on a scouting expedition to visit the Trekkers. Eventually, Pretorius left the Cape Colony permanently. He abandoned his trek towards the Modderrivier and made haste to the Klein-Tugela river in Natal when he was summoned to lead the Voortrekkers who were there leaderless; Gerrit Maritz died of illness and Andries Potgieter left Natal moving deeper inland. At the command of the Zulu king Dingane, Piet Retief was murdered in February 1838 along with his men. They were invited under false pretenses, during a negotiations visit, along with 70 men with boys among them and with 30 servants to enter the Zulu kraal Mgungundlovu unarmed.

Pretorius arrived at the desperate Trekkers&#x27; main camp on 22 November 1838. Pretorius&#x27; diligence and thorough action immediately instilled confidence and he was appointed chief commander of the punitive commando against Dingane.
Pretorius led 470 men with 64 wagons into Dingane&#x27;s territory and on the dawn of 16 December 1838, next to the Ncome River, they achieved victory over an attacking army of 10,000 to 15,000 Zulu warriors. The Voortrekkers fought with muzzle-loading muskets and made use of two small cannons. The Zulus sustained losses of an estimated 3,000 warriors in the Battle of Blood River. The Boers sustained no casualties. Three men were injured, including Andries Pretorius who was injured on his hand by an assegai.

The Boers believe that God granted them victory and thus promised that they and their descendants would commemorate the day of the battle as a day of rest. Boers memorialized it as &quot;Dingane&#x27;s Day&quot; until 1910. It was renamed &quot;Day of the Vow&quot;, later &quot;Day of the Covenant&quot;, and made a public holiday by the first government of the Union of South Africa, which later became the Republic of South Africa. After the end of apartheid in 1994, the new totally democratic government kept the day as a public holiday as an act of conciliation to the Boers, but renamed it &quot;Day of Reconciliation&quot;.

In January 1840, Pretorius with a commando of 400 &quot;burghers&quot;, helped Mpande in his revolt against his half-brother Dingane. Mpande and Pretorius defeated Dingane&#x27;s army at the Battle of Maqongqo, which forced Dingane and those loyal to him into exile, after which Dingane was soon murdered. Immediately thereafter, Pretorius announced that Boer territory in Natal had been greatly enlarged due to the terms agreed with Mpande for Boer assistance. He was also the leader of the Natal Boers faction which opposed British designs on territory they had already staked claims on. In 1842, Pretorius besieged the small British garrison at Durban, but retreated to Pietermaritzburg on the arrival of reinforcements under Colonel Josias Cloete. Afterward, he exerted his influence with the Boers to reach a peaceful solution with the British authorities, who annexed Natalia instead.

Remaining in Natal as a British subject, in 1847 Pretorius was chosen by the Boer farmers to present their grievances to the governor of Cape Colony. They were concerned about the continuous migration of natives who were assigned locations to the detriment of Boer land claims. Pretorius went to Grahamstown to seek an audience with the governor, Sir Henry Pottinger, but he refused to see Pretorius or receive any communication from him. Pretorius returned to Natal determined to abandon his farm and move beyond the reach of the British authorities.

With a considerable following, he was preparing to cross the Drakensberg when Sir Harry Smith, newly appointed governor of the Cape, reached the emigrants&#x27; camp on the Tugela River in January 1848. Smith promised the farmers protection from the natives and persuaded many of the party to remain. Pretorius departed, and, on the proclamation of British sovereignty up to the Vaal River, fixed his residence in the Magaliesberg, north of that river. He was chosen by the &quot;burghers&quot; living on both banks of the Vaal as their commandant-general. At the request of the Boers at Winburg, Pretorius crossed the Vaal in July and led the anti-British party in a brief revolt, occupying Bloemfontein on 20 July. In August, he was defeated at Boomplaats by Smith and retreated to the north of the Vaal. He became leader of one of the largest of the parties into which the Transvaal Boers were divided, and commandant-general of Potchefstroom and Rustenburg, his principal rival being Commandant-General of Zoutpansberg A. H. Potgieter.

In 1851, Boer malcontents in the Orange River Sovereignty and the Basotho chief Moshoeshoe I asked Pretorius to come to their aid. He announced his intention of crossing the Vaal to &quot;restore order&quot; in the Sovereignty. His goal was to obtain an acknowledgment of the independence of the Transvaal Boers from the British. Having decided on a policy of abandonment, the British cabinet entertained his proposal. The government withdrew its reward of 2000 pounds, which had been offered for his capture after the Boomplaats battle. Pretorius met the British commissioners near the Sand River. On 17 January 1852 they concluded the convention by which the independence of the Transvaal Boers was recognized by Britain.

Pretorius recrossed the Vaal River, and on 16 March he reconciled with Potgieter at Rustenburg. The followers of both leaders approved the convention, although the Potgieter party was not represented. In the same year, Pretorius paid a visit to Durban with the object of opening up trade between Natal and the new republic. In 1852, he also attempted to close the road to the interior through Bechuanaland and sent a commando to the western border against Sechele.

Pretorius died at his home at Magaliesberg in July 1853. He is described by Theal as &quot;the ablest leader and most perfect representative of the Emigrant Farmers.&quot; In 1855, a new district and a new town were formed out of the Potchefstroom and Rustenburg districts by his son, Marthinus Wessel Pretorius, who named them Pretoria in honour of the late commandant-general. Marthinus Wessel Pretorius was the first president of the Transvaal Republic.

<text>Operation Savanna (or Operation Savannah) was the first insertion of SOE trained Free French paratroops into German-occupied France during World War II.

This SOE mission, requested by the Air Ministry, was to ambush and kill as many pilots as possible of the Kampfgruppe 100, a German Pathfinder formation stationed at Meucon airfield which spearheaded night raids on Britain.

Setting off from an RAF Whitley on the moonlit night of 15 March 1941, five paratroops made a blind drop at midnight, landing some eight miles east of the town of Vannes (where the Pathfinder crew billeted), and five miles off target. The following day they discovered the pilots no longer commuted between Vannes and Meucon by bus, but had taken to travelling on an &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis by cars. Hence the grand ambush and assassination had to be aborted.

Seeking to gain something from the mission, Captain Georges Bergé instructed his men to disperse and go on general reconnaissance and meet at Sables d&#x27;Olonne at the end of the month for extraction by sea. 

One of the men was already missing and another failed to make the rendezvous. After several nights watching from the sand dunes, on 4/5 April, Bergé saw Geoffrey Appleyard of the SOE&#x27;s Small Scale Raiding Force paddling ashore after launching from the submarine HMS &quot;Tigris&quot;. The two other kayaks were damaged being launched so only Bergé and Forman could be extracted. Joël Le Tac remained behind and made his way to a safehouse in Paris and continued as an SOE operative.

The Free French paratroops went on to later form the French SAS and Bergé took part in some early raids in the near east, eventually rising to the rank of general.

<text>Decipher, Inc. is an American gaming company headquartered in Norfolk, Virginia, US. The company began with three puzzles marketed as &quot;Decipher,&quot; subsequently marketing party games and &quot;Pente&quot; sets. After 1994, Decipher produced collectible card and role-playing games — including their longest-running product, &quot;How to Host a Murder&quot; Mystery series. Other popular works have included many different card games. Since 2002, Decipher has released two licensed role-playing games: &quot;Star Trek RPG&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game&quot;.

==History==
Decipher was founded by Warren Holland in 1983 designing and marketing games. Their first project was the Decipher contest puzzle, a &quot;contest&quot; jigsaw puzzle that challenged buyers to solve four cryptograms printed on the jigsaw puzzle and enter to win a prize. This was followed by Decipher II, of which all four embedded puzzles were solved, though the solution to the last puzzle has since been lost; and Decipher III, which remains unsolved. 

The Decipher puzzles led to the launch of the successful &quot;How to Host a Murder&quot; line of party games. Subsequently they purchased the license for &quot;Pente&quot; from Parker Brothers, which they began marketing, maintaining a position in the games market.

Ten years later, after Decipher noticed the advent of collectible card games (CCGs), and game designers Tom Braunlich and Rollie Tesh (both former &quot;Pente&quot; world champions) conceptualized a media license-based CCG, and in November 1993 approached Decipher with a marketing idea. The following month, Decipher acquired the license from Paramount to create a CCG based on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. In August 1994, the new game was previewed for the first time at Gen Con, and in November 1994 it was officially released.

Following the early success of the &quot;Star Trek: TNG CCG&quot;, Decipher sought another popular media license as a suitable game premise, and in December 1995, after acquiring the rights from Lucasfilm, Decipher released the &quot;Star Wars Customizable Card Game&quot; in 1995. Both games became extremely popular and were ranked among the top five CCGs for the majority of their production (&quot;Star Wars&quot; often placing second behind only &quot;&quot;). Despite an initial planned three-year run for the &quot;Star Trek:TNG&quot; game, in November 1996 Decipher announced they had renegotiated with Paramount to continue producing the game and expand the license agreement to include not only &quot;Star Trek:TNG&quot;, but also all of the other live-action &quot;Star Trek&quot; licenses (including &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, and all of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; films).

In 1999, with the release of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; movie &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;, Decipher made the decision to expand its market towards a younger generation. Other games like &quot;Pokémon&quot; were successfully drawing younger kids into card gaming, but Decipher&#x27;s existing two games were seen as requiring too much thinking and planning for a younger child to properly understand and enjoy. So in response, Decipher created the &quot;Young Jedi Collectible Card Game&quot; to target this audience. This game used images exclusively from the new movies, while the original &quot;Star Wars CCG&quot; continued to use images only from the original trilogy until 2001.

In 1999, Decipher made an attempt to merge their previous successes by creating a licensed card game designed to target the party game audience. They acquired the license for &quot;Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot; and created the &quot;Austin Powers Collectible Card Game&quot;. However, because the company was better known as a card-gaming company than a party-game company, by that point the game was seen as a poor attempt at a card game and ultimately failed, with production being put indefinitely on hold after the initial release.

In 2001, Decipher attempted to capitalize further on their successful &quot;Star Wars&quot; games by creating a third game called &quot;Jedi Knights Trading Card Game&quot;. This game was distinct from the others because all of the card images were entirely computer-generated. This enabled them to create scenes not seen in the movies, or from new angles. They also increased the breadth of licenses by acquiring the card game license for the new &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; series of films being produced by New Line Cinemas beginning that year. This acquisition became even more important at the end of the year when it was announced that Decipher lost the &quot;Star Wars&quot; license, which ended production on all three &quot;Star Wars&quot; games.

Decipher made more changes to its target markets in 2002, this time by expanding into role-playing games. Decipher acquired most of the gaming studio from Last Unicorn Games, and extended the licenses that they already held in order to create the &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; role-playing games, using a new &quot;CODA System&quot; which they developed. They also relaunched the &quot;Star Trek CCG&quot; with a new 2nd Edition, drawing on many of the same game mechanics that had made the first edition so popular, but streamlining them to be easier to learn for new players.

The following year, in 2003 Decipher made another attempt to enter the younger player CCG market, which was now dominated by &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot;. They acquired the licenses for and released new games based on the popular &quot;.hack&quot; and &quot;Beyblade&quot; series. Although the &quot;Beyblade Trading Card Game&quot; was short-lived, the &quot;.hack//Enemy Trading Card Game&quot; was well received and lasted several years.

In 2004, they produced another license-based children&#x27;s game, this time based on the &quot;Mega Man NT Warrior&quot; series. They also created their first non-franchised card game entitled &quot;Wars&quot;, which utilized the same basic game mechanics that had made their original &quot;Star Wars CCG&quot; so popular.

2005 was a hard year for the company. With the wavering success of the &quot;.hack&quot; and &quot;Mega Man&quot; cartoons, they were forced to cancel both lines. The &quot;Wars&quot; game had failed to gain the audience they&#x27;d hoped for because it lacked the brand recognition associated with most of their other games and so it was put indefinitely on hold. After a brief attempt at a resurgence in the form of digital media, they shut down their RPG lines as well. With the overall decline of the gaming industry, in addition to embezzlement which cost the company millions, the company suffered significant financial losses and was forced to lay off as many as 40 employees.

For the next two years Decipher focused on their two remaining properties, &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;. However, in 2007 with the expiration of Decipher&#x27;s license, the company released their final expansion set for the &quot;Lord of the Rings TCG&quot;, &quot;Age&#x27;s End&quot;. On December 12, 2007, Decipher also issued a press release announcing the end of the &quot;Star Trek CCG&quot; line of product with the next expansion, &quot;What You Leave Behind&quot;.

During the holiday season of 2007, Decipher replaced their traditional home page with a teaser promising that &quot;a player revolution is coming in 2008.&quot; On March 30, 2008, Decipher began looking for Founding Members for their new game series &quot;Fight Klub&quot;. Fight Klub was designed to be a new style of CCG, using a unique new marketing model. It was released in February 2009, and is themed on combat between (typically macho) characters from several film licences, such as Rambo, Mr. Blonde, and Chuck Norris.

In January 2012, it was announced that their website would shortly also be hosting material related to the &quot;How to Host a Murder&quot; series, suggesting that the series (which had not seen a new release for nine years) may be returning.

===Embezzlement and financial difficulties===
In March 2009, it was reported that Holland&#x27;s brother-in-law Rick Eddleman had pleaded guilty to embezzling over $1.5 million (USD) from Decipher, Inc. since the year 2000. Eddleman had been VP Finances for Decipher since 1993 and used his position to write checks to himself and to use company credit cards for personal purposes. The losses contributed to the company&#x27;s decision to lay off more than 90 employees.

Eddleman faced a maximum sentence of 12 years in prison for 12 counts of embezzlement and a settlement of a civil lawsuit against him by Decipher for $8.9 million. On July 27, 2009, he was sentenced to six years and five months in prison.

==&quot;WARS&quot; Fiction==
In collaboration with science fiction author Michael A. Stackpole and Chuck Kallenbach, Decipher created numerous eBook-exclusive PDFs of short stories to tie into the game. Afterwards, Decipher partnered with Grail Quest books to publish a trilogy of novels set during the Battle of Phobos. However, only two were published. 

In 2021, Decipher entered a new partnership with Arcbeatle Press. The company would publish five short stories for the anniversary, before going on to reprint and complete the &quot;Battle of Phobos&quot; trilogy under the collective title of &quot;WARSONG&quot;. Simultaneously, the partnership would create a spin-off series, &quot;Academy 27&quot;. 

The partnership would lead to the first &quot;WARS&quot; crossover, &quot;And Today, You&quot;, crossing over with the Arcbeatle original series &quot;10,000 Dawns&quot; and the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; independent spin-off &quot;Cwej: The Series&quot;. 

==Player spin-off organizations==
Following Decipher&#x27;s loss of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise rights in 2001, Decipher employees and volunteers of the card game created a new entity entitled the &quot;&quot;Star Wars&quot; Customizable Card Game Players Committee&quot; (or SWCCGPC). Decipher donated over one million dollars in product, promotional materials, and financial backing to the Players Committee to continue support and tournament organization of the game indefinitely. Since 2002, the Players Committee has created several new virtual card sets for the game.

A Continuing Committee has existed for the &quot;Star Trek&quot; CCG since 2008, and a Player&#x27;s Council for the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; TCG was established in 2020.

<doc id="425408" wikidata="Q7705708" url="?curid=425408" title="Test Card F">
<text>Test Card F is a test card that was created by the BBC and used on television in the United Kingdom and in countries elsewhere in the world for more than four decades. Like other test cards, it was usually shown while no programmes were being broadcast. It was the first to be transmitted in colour in the UK and the first to feature a person, and has become an iconic British image regularly subject to parody.

The central image on the card shows Carole Hersee playing noughts and crosses with a clown doll, Bubbles the Clown, surrounded by various greyscales and colour test signals used to assess the quality of the transmitted picture. It was first broadcast on 2 July 1967 (the day after the first colour pictures appeared to the public on television) on BBC2.

The card was developed by BBC engineer George Hersee (1924–2001), the father of the girl in the central image. It was frequently broadcast during daytime downtime on BBC Television until 29 April 1983, when it was replaced with broadcasts of Ceefax pages. It continued to be seen for around 7.5 minutes each day before the start of Ceefax broadcasts but it would also be shown on days when the Ceefax generator was not working. It was further phased out from BBC1 in November 1997 when the station began to air 24 hours a day, followed by BBC2 in January 1999 when its overnight downtime was replaced entirely by &quot;Pages from Ceefax&quot;. After then it was only seen during engineering work, and was last seen in this role in 2011. The card was also seen on ITV in the 1970s, occasionally used in conjunction with Test Card G.

In the digital age, Test Card F and its variants are very infrequently broadcast, as downtime hours in schedules have largely been discontinued. Several variations of TCF have been screened, among them Test Card J (digitally enhanced), Test Card W (widescreen) and its high definition variant, which is sometimes erroneously referred to as Test Card X.

Up until the UK&#x27;s digital switchover in 2010–2012, the test card made an appearance during the annual RBS (rebroadcast standby) Test Transmissions and, until 2013, during the BBC HD preview loop, which used Test Card W.

==Technical information==
Virtually all the designs and patterns on the card have some significance. Along the top (see above) are 95% saturation colour bars in descending order of luminance—white, yellow, cyan, green, magenta, red, blue and black. There are triangles on each of the four sides of the card to check for correct overscanning of the picture. Standard greyscale and frequency response (1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4, 4.5 and 5.25 MHz) tests are found on the left and right respectively of the central picture. On the updated version known as Test Card J (including widescreen and HD versions), the X on the noughts-and-crosses board is an indicator for aligning the centre of the screen.

The blocks of colour on the sides would cause the picture to tear horizontally if the sync circuits were not adjusted properly. The closely spaced lines in various parts of the screen allowed focus to be checked from centre to edge; mistuning would also blur the lines. All parts of the greyscale would not be distinct if contrast and brightness (both internal preset settings and user adjustments) were not set correctly. The black bar on a white background revealed ringing and signal reflections. The castellations along the top and bottom also revealed possible setup problems.

In the centre image, a child was depicted so that wrong skin colour would be obvious and not subject to changing make-up fashions. The juxtaposed garish colours of the clown were such that a common transmission error called chrominance/luminance delay inequality would make the clown&#x27;s yellow buttons turn white. Use of centre images in test cards were however not a new idea; RTF and ORTF in France used the Marly Horses as the central motif of its monochrome 819-line test card which was used on TF1 between 1953 and 1983, and the first French colour test card featuring a centre image of colourful roses was used on France 2 from 1967 until sometime around the mid-1970s. SVT in Sweden was also later inspired by Test Card F to develop its own colour test card, based on its earlier monochrome test cards, with a girl holding a doll in the centre image.

Modern circuitry using large-scale integration is much less susceptible to most of these problems. Some of them are also associated with cathode-ray tubes; modern screens use liquid crystal displays (LCDs) that are not scanned at high speed. The test card was a vital tool in its day, but has become far less important.

The name of the broadcasting channel usually appeared in the space underneath the letter F—a sans-serif F denoting an original optical version of the test card.

Originally, Test Card F was a photographic slide made up of two transparencies in perfect registration—one containing the colour information (chrominance) and the other the monochrome background (luminance). The card was converted to electronic form in 1984 when electronic storage became possible.

==Audio accompaniment==

A sound of some kind is usually transmitted in the background. It is either music, usually a composition commissioned by the station itself or &quot;royalty-free&quot; stock music, or a steady tone. Composers whose music has been used include Roger Roger, Johnny Pearson, Neil Richardson, Frank Chacksfield, Syd Dale, John Cameron, Brian Bennett, Keith Mansfield, and Alan Hawkshaw.

In recent years, the Test Card is only shown during engineering tests on the BBC and is accompanied by a steady tone of various pitches accompanied by a female talking clock. Test Card music had ceased to be frequently heard with the test card by the end of the 1980s, although it continued to be played over Pages from Ceefax until the termination of that service on 22 October 2012.

==Bubbles the Clown==

Along with his Test Card F co-star Carole Hersee, Bubbles has appeared for an estimated total of 70,000 hours on television, equivalent to nearly eight whole years. Carole still owns Bubbles.

===Colour===
Bubbles&#x27;s original body colour was blue and white, but the BBC engineers decided that green was also needed within the scene as the other two television primary colours, red and blue, were already shown. A green wrap was made to cover his body and this can be seen in Test Card J and Test Card W, along with more of his body shown in the photograph — revealing the fact that he is actually holding a piece of chalk, which was not previously visible.

However, the shade of green material chosen was too subtle for the engineers&#x27; liking and so Bubbles&#x27; body colour in Test Card F was retouched (this can be seen from the edges of his image) to make it more saturated and also to give it a higher luminance value on screen.

==Overseas usage==
Test Card F was also used in approximately 30 countries outside the UK. Notable overseas users included:
* Bahrain Radio and Television Corporation in Bahrain
* DR in Denmark (Replaced along with Philips PM5552 by the Philips circle pattern in 1970)
* NRK in Norway, briefly in the 1970s
* SVT in Sweden, briefly in the 1970s
* STW-9 in Perth, Australia
* TCN-9 and TEN-10 in Sydney, Australia
* NBN-3 in Newcastle, Australia
* Radio Television Singapore (RTS)/Singapore Broadcasting Corporation (SBC), albeit with the original centre image replaced with another slide featuring a puppet resembling Bubbles the Clown and four girls, one of each of the four official races of Singapore. This particular test card was introduced in 1974 upon the introduction of colour television in Singapore, replacing a modified 625-line version of Test Card C, but was later replaced by the Philips circle pattern which had likely previously been used internally.
* New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation (NZBC) briefly used a modified version of TCF until its dissolution in 1975, replacing its common monochrome test card design dating back to the non-networked-AKTV2/CHTV3/WNTV1/DNTV2 era. It was first introduced at the beginning of colour television broadcasts in 1973. One of the two successors of NZBC (South Pacific Television; now TVNZ 2) also occasionally used TCF and another TCF-inspired test card called T1 up until approximately 1980. Upon renaming to TVNZ it subsequently replaced TCF and its variants with the Philips circle pattern which was used well into the 1990s.

==Variants and updated versions==
===Unlettered BBC Widescreen test card===
A 16:9 (1.78:1) widescreen predecessor to Test Card W without an identifying letter first appeared in March 1998 as part of digital tests on the Astra 1D satellite, and was notably broadcast to the public on 6 November 1998 as part of a joke on &quot;Have I Got News For You&quot; to censor then-host Angus Deayton about discussing Peter Mandelson&#x27;s life. 

===Test Card J ===

Test Card J is an updated version of Test Card F, and first appeared in November 1999. It includes the following changes relative to its predecessor:

* A newly added green square at the top of the screen is used to facilitate easier observation of chrominance to luminance delay.
* The negative black squares in the left hand step pattern should flash on and off at 1 Hz. This is to aid in the detection of frozen digital links.
* The central image is based on the same source photograph, but with some minor adjustments:
** It has been rescanned from the original transparency for improved colour accuracy.
** The image has been re-aligned within Test Card J such that the cross on the noughts and crosses board is at the exact centre of the screen, as some believe was originally intended.
** It is less tightly cropped, resulting in more edge detail from the original photograph being visible.

===Test Card W ===

Test Card W is an updated 16:9 (1.78:1) widescreen version of Test Card F. It first appeared in November 1999 alongside Test Card J, with which it bears some similarities.

The colour-bars on the top and right of the image are the full 100 per cent saturation version, unlike Test Cards F and J which use the 95 per cent type. Extra mirrored arrow-heads on the central axis at the sides mark the positions of the middle 4:3 and 14:9 sections of the image.

On Freeview in the United Kingdom, Test Card W can be viewed at any time on most Freeview boxes.

====BBC HD channel variant (&quot;Test Card X&quot;) ==== 

A 1080 line variant of Test Card W (sometimes referred to unofficially as Test Card X) was used on the now-defunct BBC HD channel. It could be viewed every two hours as part of the BBC HD preview slot. When viewed, it was enhanced with 5.1 surround sound tests. A BLITS tone is played alongside, which plays test tones at different frequencies from each of the different surround sound speakers, with markers (such as L, R, C, LFE, Ls, Rs) appearing inside some of the grey boxes of the testcard. BBC HD closed in March 2013; therefore Test Card X is no longer regularly broadcast. Test Card X did however make an appearance on the lunchtime edition of &quot;Sportsday&quot; on the BBC News channel on 18 January 2023, in place of a slide intended to show the BBC Sport website.

====BBC Two variant (2016) ====

From August 2016 until July 2019, the latest iteration of the widescreen testcard could be seen briefly each morning at 7:00 am on BBC Two and BBC Two HD. At the centre bottom of the test card is an animated grey bar with graduations corresponding to 1/12 of a second. The animation is accompanied by a &#x27;pip&#x27; that occurs when the animated bar reaches the centre mark (indicated by a 0), which together can be used to determine whether the digital audio and video signals are synchronised.

==Recent years==
In May 1983, trade test transmissions of the test card ended when Ceefax pages began to be shown during all daytime intervals. This meant that Test Card F was only seen for a few minutes early in the morning.

1992 was the last year that Test Card F was seen daily with music; 1995 was the last year it was seen with music, although it was seen until 1999 with just tone output, and Ceefax was broadcast either with tone or music. However, since the closure of Ceefax, the shutdown of analogue television transmissions, and the imposition of budgetary constraints, a new revision of the testcard can be seen daily on BBC Two and BBC Two HD at the end of the &quot;This is BBC Two&quot; transmission. Each morning, as the segment concludes, the testcard is broadcast for approximately one minute.

Since the late 1990s, Bubbles has only very rarely appeared on television, as Test Card F has been discontinued, and Test Cards J and W are very seldom shown, due to the advent of digital television and 24-hour programming.

For the fortieth anniversary of Test Card F, there was some renewed interest in Bubbles in the media; in a 2007 interview, Hersee mentioned that she took Bubbles into school with her to prove to her headmaster that she really was the girl in the picture.

The BBC website previously featured Bubbles next to a blackboard with &quot;404&quot; inscribed on it when a user visited a page that did not exist; however, some time between July 2017 and May 2020, this was replaced with an image of two &quot;clangers&quot; (animated puppets) from the BBC television show &quot;Clangers&quot;. Similarly, in 2015 the BBC website&#x27;s &quot;500&quot; Internal Error page featured a cross-eyed Bubbles appearing in front of a blackboard with a background of fire; however, this has since been replaced with the same error message seen on the 404 page.

Prior to the relaunch of BBC Three in 2022, Test Card F aired for periods of 20 minutes.

==In popular culture==

Variations and parodies of Test Card F are common in British broadcasting, Internet sites, and games. Some prominent examples include:
*The TV series &quot;Life on Mars&quot; features a Test Card Girl based on Test Card F, who teases and torments the lead character, Sam Tyler.
*Parodies have been used in promotional material or videos for many songs (often with band members&#x27; faces), including Radiohead&#x27;s 2000 album &quot;Kid A&quot;, &quot;(Waiting For) The Ghost Train&quot; by Madness, and the Gorillaz music video &quot;Hallelujah Money.&quot;
*The test card has also been used in the &quot;Numberblocks&quot; episode &quot;Tween Scenes,&quot; with Ten replacing Carole Hersee and Three replacing Bubbles the Clown.
*&quot;Dave Allen At Large&quot; included a parody of Test Card F where a hand came out and completed the game of noughts and crosses.
*The &quot;Animaniacs reboot&#x27;s&quot; segment &quot;The Flawed Couple&quot; featured a parody of Test Card F with Pinky in place of Carole Hersee and the Brain wearing clown makeup in place of Bubbles.
*RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race UK contestant Cheddar Gorgeous wore a runway look inspired by Test Card F for the season four runway &quot;Keeping it 100!&quot;, which was held in honor of the BBC&#x27;s 100th anniversary.
*The trailers of the video game Worms W.M.D parodies the Test Card F where Carole and Bubbles are replaced by worms looking like them. Also, the grid on the blackboard is replaced by a drawing of a grenade, an emblematic weapon of the game franchise.

<doc id="425409" wikidata="Q229566" url="?curid=425409" title="Carmen Kass">
<text>Carmen Kass (born 14 September 1978) is an Estonian model and actress. She has worked as the face of brands such as Chanel, Versace, Yves Saint Laurent, Gucci, Valentino, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Christian Dior, Givenchy, and, for ten consecutive years, Michael Kors. The American edition of &quot;Vogue&quot; declared her and Gisele Bündchen the two supermodels of the era on its January 2000 cover.

Outside of modeling, Kass ran for the European Parliament in 2004 and was the president of the Estonian Chess Federation from 2004 to 2011.

==Early life==
Kass was born in Paide, Estonia and grew up in the village of Mäo, near Paide, Järva County. Kass, her elder sister Victoria and elder brother Kutty were raised by their mother, Koidu Põder. Her father, Viktor Kass, was a chess teacher in Põlva.

==Career==
===Modeling===
When Kass was 14 years old, she was discovered in a supermarket by a model scout from Milan. Her first venture into the modeling world was unsuccessful, and Kass left Milan after a short time.

Kass then moved to Paris at the age of eighteen. She soon received exposure by appearing on the covers of American, French, British, and Italian &quot;Vogue&quot;, Australian &quot;Elle&quot;, UK &quot;Image&quot;, &quot;Madame Figaro&quot;, and French &quot;Numéro&quot;. Kass&#x27;s first &quot;Vogue&quot; cover was French &quot;Vogue&quot; in November 1997.
Her career was launched by Anna Wintour, and by 1999, Kass was walking the runway for numerous and diverse top designers, such as Marc Jacobs, Michael Kors, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Donna Karan, and Dolce &amp; Gabbana; and posing in advertisements for designers and brands, like Calvin Klein, Chanel, Gucci, Donna Karan, Dsquared2, Versace, Givenchy, Fendi, Max Mara, Valentino, Ralph Lauren, Narciso Rodriguez, and even General Motors. She also appeared in a Gap denim advertising campaign, and was a spokesperson for Revlon cosmetics, Sephora, and the Christian Dior perfume, &quot;J&#x27;adore&quot;. In 2007 alone, Kass booked ten campaigns with notable designers for Spring/Summer collections. From 2007 onwards, she became the model and spokesperson for Max Factor.

Kass was the muse of Michael Kors, and the face of the brand for 10 consecutive years. Kass has been also the spokesperson of the Narciso Rodriguez For Her perfume and several of its editions for 17 consecutive years to date.

Kass was named &quot;Model of the Year&quot; at the 2000 VH1/Vogue Fashion Awards. In the year 2002, she was estimated to have been the second-highest-paid model in the world. She is well-known for her distinctive runway walk in the fashion industry. Despite her height, her feet are relatively small (about an American size seven).

She opened and closed the Victoria&#x27;s Secret Fashion Show in 1999, and also walked for the brand in 2000, 2002, 2003, and 2008.

She is considered to be one of the models who ended the heroin chic era along with Gisele Bündchen.

===Film===
While living in New York, she attended the Lee Strasberg Institute. In 2004, Kass played the female lead in the Estonian murder-mystery film &quot;Täna öösel me ei maga&quot; (&quot;We Won&#x27;t Sleep Tonight&quot;; titled &quot;Set Point&quot; in the international release). She also had a cameo appearance in the film &quot;Zoolander&quot;, where she played herself opening the &quot;Derelicte&quot; fashion show.
===Politics===
In February 2004, she joined Estonia&#x27;s ruling Res Publica Party. Kass ran for the European Parliament after her homeland joined the European Union in May 2004. She received 2,315 votes and was not elected.

=== Chess ===
Kass is a keen chess player. She was elected president of the Estonian Chess Federation for 8 consecutive years and currently serves as a councillor. She ran a campaign for Tallinn to host the 2008 Chess Olympics; however, Dresden, Germany was chosen instead.

===Business===
She was a part owner of her mother agency, Baltic Models.

==Personal life==
From 2004 until 2014, Kass was in a relationship with Eric Lobron, a German chess grandmaster.

Her nephew, Antonio Sebastian Kass, is also a model and a musician.

Kass speaks Estonian and English.

<text>Reçak (; ) is a village in the Shtime municipality of Kosovo. It was the site of the January 1999 Račak massacre, in which 45 villagers were killed by Serbian forces.

== History ==
The village was first mentioned in a chrysobull by the Serbian Emperor Stefan Dušan in 1343. Noted in an Ottoman defter of 1487, the village was home to a monastery, consecrated in the name of Saints Cosmas and Damian.

=== Račak massacre ===

Prior to the summer of 1998, Račak had a population of around 2,000 people. Most of its population was displaced by fighting between the Yugoslav Army and soldiers from the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) in July 1998.

By January 1999, about 350 people had returned to the village, according to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). On 16 January 1999, OSCE monitors found the bodies of 45 people in and around the village in what became widely known as the Račak massacre. Following the incident, for which the international community blamed the Serbian military, the remaining population fled and did not return until the end of the Kosovo War in June 1999.

There is a memorial to the victims of the massacre in the village, where an annual ceremony to honour them is held.

== Geography ==
Račak is located about half a kilometer southwest of the town of Shtime. The village lies on the Carraleva-mountain range. This mountain range divides the Kosovo field and Metohija.

=== Climate ===
== Population ==
As of the census of 2011, Račak had a population of 1,638 of whom 1,629 were Albanian, one was Bosniak and eight did not answer. 1,631 were Muslims and seven did not answer.

<doc id="425415" wikidata="Q2300947" url="?curid=425415" title="Social cost">
<text>Social cost in neoclassical economics is the sum of the private costs resulting from a transaction and the costs imposed on the consumers as a consequence of being exposed to the transaction for which they are not compensated or charged. In other words, it is the sum of private and external costs. This might be applied to any number of economic problems: for example, social cost of carbon has been explored to better understand the costs of carbon emissions for proposed economic solutions such as a carbon tax.

Private costs refer to direct costs to the producer for producing the good or service. Social cost includes these private costs and the additional costs (or external costs) associated with the production of the good which are not accounted for by the free market. In short, when the consequences of an action cannot be taken by the initiator, we will have external costs in the society. We will have private costs when initiator can take responsibility for agent&#x27;s action.

==Definitions==
Mathematically, social marginal cost is the sum of private marginal cost and the external costs. For example, when selling a glass of lemonade at a lemonade stand, the private costs involved in this transaction are the costs of the lemons and the sugar and the water that are ingredients to the lemonade, the opportunity cost of the labor to combine them into lemonade, as well as any transaction costs, such as walking to the stand. An example of marginal damages associated with social costs of driving includes wear and tear, congestion, and the decreased quality of life due to drunks driving or impatience, and many people displaced from their homes and localities due to construction work. Another social cost of driving includes the pollution driving costs to other people in the society. For both private costs and external costs, the agents involved are assumed to be optimizing.

==Alternatives==
The alternative to the above neoclassical definition is provided by the heterodox economics theory of social costs by K. William Kapp. Social costs are here defined as the socialized portion of the total costs of production, i.e., the costs which businesses shift to society in their attempts to increase their profits.
In this sense Kapp&#x27;s understanding of social costs is consistent with the &quot;Social Costs of Carbon&quot; calculations below because these costs arise primarily from carbon-based production (not exchange) and are shifted to society. Different from &quot;social cost of carbon arguments&quot; the cause of social costs is identified in existing capitalist accounting laws which allow producers to leave them unpaid. Due to its mode of economic calculation and accounting capitalism is essentially a system of cost shifting. Legalized cost shifting is one of the main sources of profits.

==Economic theory==
According to the International Monetary Fund, &quot;there are differences between private costs and the costs to the society as a whole&quot;. In a situation where there are positive social costs, it means that the first of the Fundamental theorems of welfare economics failed in that relying merely on private markets for price and quantity lead to an inefficient outcome. Market failures or situations in which consumption, investment, and production decisions made by individuals or firms result in indirect costs i.e. have an effect on parties external to the transaction are one of the most common reasons for government intervention. In economics, these indirect costs which lead to inefficiencies in the market and result in a difference between the private costs and the social costs are called externalities. Thus, social costs are the costs pertaining to the transaction costs to the society as a whole. Generally, social costs are easier to think about in marginal terms i.e. marginal social cost. Marginal social cost refers to the total costs that the society pays for the production of an extra unit of the good or service in question. Mathematically, this can be represented by Marginal Social Cost (MSC) = Marginal Private Cost (MPC) + Marginal External Costs (MEC).

Social costs can be of two types—Negative Production Externality and Positive Production Externality. Negative Production Externality refers to a situation in which marginal damages are social costs to society that result in Marginal Social Cost being greater than the Marginal Private Cost i.e. MSC &gt; MPC. Intuitively, this refers to a situation in which the production of the firm reduces the well-being of the people in the society who are not compensated for the same. For example, steel production results in a negative externality because of the marginal damages pertaining to pollution and negative environmental effects. Steelmaking results in indirect costs as a result of emission of pollutants, lower air quality, etc. For example, these indirect costs might include the health of a homeowner near the production unit and higher healthcare costs which have not been factored into the free market price and quantity. Given that the producer does not bear the burden of these costs, they are not passed down to the end user thus creating a situation where MSC &gt; MPC.

This example can be better elucidated with a diagram. Profit-maximizing organizations in a free market will set output at QMarket where marginal private costs (MPC) is equal to marginal benefit (MB). Intuitively, this is the point on the diagram where the private supply curve (MPC) and consumer demand curve (MB) intersect i.e. where consumer demand meets firm supply. This results in a competitive market equilibrium price of pMarket.

In the presence of a negative production externality, the private marginal cost increases i.e. shifted upwards to the left by marginal damages to yield the marginal social curve. The star in the diagram, or the point where the new supply curve (inclusive of marginal damages to society) and the consumer demand intersect, represents the socially optimum quantity Qoptimum and price. At this social optimum, the price paid by the consumer is p*consumer and the price received by the producers is p*producer.

High positive social costs, in the form of marginal damages, lead to an over-production. In the diagram, there is overproduction at QMarket - Qoptimum with an associated deadweight loss of the shaded triangle. One of the public sector remedies for internalizing externalities is a corrective tax. According to neoclassical economist Arthur Pigou, in order to correct this market failure (or externality) the government should levy a tax which equals to marginal damages per unit. This would effectively increase the firm&#x27;s private marginal so that SMC = PMC.

The prospect of government intervention in regards to correcting an externality has been hotly debated. Economists like Ronald Coase contend that the market can internalize an externality and provide for an external outcome through bargaining among affected parties. For example, in the above-mentioned case, the homeowners could negotiate with the pollution firm and strike a deal in which they would pay the firm not to pollute or to charge the firm for pollution; the outcome pertaining to who pays is determined by bargaining power. According to Thomas Helbing at the International Monetary Fund, government intervention might be most optimal in situations where one party might have undue bargaining power compared to the other party.

In an alternative scenario, positive production externality occurs when the social costs of production are lower than the marginal private costs of production. For example, the social benefit of research and development not only applies to the profits made by the firm but also helps improve the health of society through better quality of life, lower healthcare costs, etc. In this case, the marginal social cost curve would shift downwards and there would be underproduction. In this case, government intervention would result in a Pigouvian subsidy in order to decrease the firm&#x27;s private marginal cost so that MPC = SMC.

== Issues ==
Quantification of social costs, for damages or benefits in the future resulting from current production, is a critical problem for the presentation of social costs and when attempting to formulate policy to correct the externality. For example, damages to the environment, socioeconomic or political impacts, and costs or benefits that span long horizons are difficult to predict and quantify. Thus, it is difficult to include in a cost-benefit analysis.

Another example concerning the difficulty surrounding the estimation of social costs is the social cost of carbon. In trying to monetize the social costs arising from carbon, one needs to understand &quot;the effect of a ton of a greenhouse gas on global temperatures, the effect of temperature change on agricultural yields, human health, flood risk, and myriad other harms to the ecosystem&quot;. Analysts from Brookings Institution contend that one of the reasons the estimation of the social cost of carbon is incredibly complex is that the external costs imposed on society as a result of the transactions of one firm in China, for example, impact the quality of lives and health of consumers living in the United States.

Social costs are also linked with the analysis of market failure. Take the national dividend, for example; to maximize the national dividend it is required that one set marginal social costs and marginal social benefits equal to each other. Marginal private costs and marginal private benefits also need to be equal to each other to maximize market behaviors. However, the market will not be maximized without both sets of costs and benefits equal to each other.

== Applications ==
Social cost has been applied on a number of different critical social issues. Notably the social cost of carbon and monopolies are common topics of exploration.

<text>A media gateway is a translation device or service that converts media streams between disparate telecommunications technologies such as POTS, SS7, Next Generation Networks (2G, 2.5G and 3G radio access networks) or private branch exchange (PBX) systems. Media gateways enable multimedia communications across packet networks using transport protocols such as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and Internet Protocol (IP).

Because the media gateway connects different types of networks, one of its main functions is to convert between different transmission and coding techniques. Media streaming functions such as echo cancellation, DTMF, and tone sender are also located in the media gateway.

Media gateways are often controlled by a separate Media Gateway Controller which provides the call control and signaling functionality. Communication between media gateways and Call Agents is achieved by means of protocols such as MGCP or Megaco (H.248) or Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). Modern media gateways used with SIP are often stand-alone units with their own call and signaling control integrated and can function as independent, intelligent SIP end-points.

Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) media gateways perform the conversion between Time-division multiplexing (TDM) voice to a media streaming protocol, such as the Real-time Transport Protocol, (RTP), as well as a signaling protocol used in the VoIP system.

Mobile access media gateways connect the radio access networks of a public land mobile network PLMN to a next-generation core network. 3GPP standards define the functionality of CS-MGW and IMS-MGW for UTRAN and GERAN based PLMNs.

<text>Evelyn Hooker (; née Gentry, September 2, 1907 – November 18, 1996) was an American psychologist most notable for her 1956 paper &quot;The Adjustment of the Male Overt Homosexual&quot; in which she administered several psychological tests to groups of self-identified male homosexuals and heterosexuals and asked experts to identify the homosexuals and rate their mental health. The experiment, which other researchers subsequently repeated, found that homosexuality was not a mental disorder, as there was no detectable difference between homosexual and heterosexual men in terms of mental adjustment.

Hooker argued that a false correlation between homosexuality and mental illness had formed the basis of classifying homosexuality as a mental disorder. The correlation was the result of earlier researchers studying sample groups that contained homosexual men with a history of treatment for mental illness. Hooker&#x27;s work was of critical importance in refuting cultural heterosexism because it found that homosexuality was not developmentally inferior to heterosexuality. Her work led the way to the eventual removal of homosexuality from the American Psychiatric Association&#x27;s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.

==Life==

Hooker was born Evelyn Gentry in North Platte, Nebraska, in her grandmother&#x27;s house and grew up with eight brothers and sisters in the Colorado Plains. When she was 13, her family moved to Sterling, Colorado. The journey to Sterling would be one of Hooker&#x27;s fondest memories.

Hooker&#x27;s mother, Jessie Bethel, who had a third grade education, told her to pursue an education because that was the only thing that could not be taken away from her. The Gentry family was not wealthy in the least, and Hooker was further stigmatized by her nearly stature. Still an advocate of education, Jessie Bethel enrolled her daughter at Sterling High School, which was large and unusually progressive for the time. There, Hooker was in an honors program and was able to take a course in psychology. Hooker wanted to go to a teachers college, but her instructors saw her potential and encouraged her to go to the University of Colorado. By the time she was ready to graduate, she had obtained a scholarship to the University of Colorado Boulder (UCB).

In 1924 she became a student at UCB while working as a maid for a rich Boulder family. Her mentor, Karl Munzinger, guided her in her challenge of the then-prevalent psychological theory of behaviourism. She wrote her thesis paper on trial-and-error learning in rats. He invited her to write her own case history. After receiving her master&#x27;s degree, she became one of 11 women involved in the PhD program in psychology at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, having been refused referral from the chairman of Yale for being a female. She studied with Knight Dunlap, who also generally did not approve of women doctorates. She was awarded her PhD in 1932.

In her early career, she was not especially interested in the psychology of homosexual people. After teaching for only one year at the Maryland College for Women, she contracted tuberculosis and spent the next year in a sanatorium in Arizona. After her recovery she began teaching at Whittier College in Southern California. Then in 1937 Gentry received a fellowship to the Berlin Institute of Psychotherapy, at which point she left Whittier. Hooker lived with a Jewish family while she studied in Europe. While there, she got a first-hand look at the rise of Adolf Hitler and witnessed such events as the Kristallnacht. She learned later that the Jewish family she lived with was killed in concentration camps. Before returning home, Hooker went on a group tour to Russia, arriving just after a major purge. The events that Hooker would see in Europe ultimately sparked her desire to help overcome social injustice.

When Hooker was ready to return to work at Whittier, she found that she could not return. The heads at Whittier were afraid of her because she had spent a year living in a totalitarian Europe. She and several other staff were let go because they were suspected of subversive behavior. As a result, she applied for work in the psychology department at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The chair of the psychology department at UCLA at the time was Knight Dunlap, Hooker&#x27;s mentor from Johns Hopkins. Dunlap said he would like to give her a job, but they already had three female faculty members and they were “cordially disliked”. She was able to get a position as a research associate, however. Hooker quickly gained a reputation as a brilliant teacher and researcher. She stayed at UCLA for 31 years, where she conducted research and taught experimental and physiological psychology until 1970 when she went into private practice.

However, during the 1940s, she first became interested in what would turn out to be her life&#x27;s work. Hooker was teaching an introductory psychology class in 1944 when a student approached her after class. He identified himself as Sam From; he confided in her that he was gay and so were most of his friends. She realized Sam was one of the brightest students in the class and quickly became friends with him. They would spend time between and after classes to talk and get to know each other. Sam introduced Hooker to his circle of homosexual friends. They would go to clubs, bars, and parties where Hooker was able to fraternize with more homosexuals. Sam&#x27;s closest friends included Christopher Isherwood and Stephen Spender, a writer and a poet. He challenged her to scientifically study &quot;people like him&quot;.

Sam proposed a question to Hooker: Why not conduct research on homosexuals to determine whether homosexuality was some sort of disease or disorder and not relevant to a person&#x27;s psychological makeup? Sam urged her to conduct research on homosexuals, saying it was &quot;her scientific duty to study people like us&quot;. Hooker was intrigued by the question and further persuaded by her experience with social rejection as a child, witnessing the effects of racial and political persecution in her travels, and discrimination in her professional life.

Over the next two decades she became established professionally. In 1948 she moved to a guest cottage at the Salter [more likely Saltair] Avenue home of Edward Hooker, professor of English at UCLA and poetry scholar. They married in London in 1951, and she took his surname. In the mid-fifties Christopher Isherwood became their neighbor. She was against the relationship of Isherwood with the much younger Don Bachardy; they were not welcome at her house. Sam From died in a car accident in 1956, just before Hooker&#x27;s ground-breaking research was published. Hooker&#x27;s husband died in January 1957 of cardiac arrest.

The 1960s saw her work find a wider audience, and her conclusions were taken up by the gay rights movement. In 1961 Hooker was invited to lecture in Europe and in 1967, the director of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) asked her to produce a report on what the institution should do about homosexual men. Richard Nixon&#x27;s election in 1969 delayed the publication of the report, which was published by a magazine, without authorization, in 1970. The report recommended the decriminalization of homosexuality and the provision of similar rights to both homosexual and heterosexual people. The burgeoning gay rights movement seized on this.

She retired from her research at UCLA in 1970 at the age of 63 and started a private practice in Santa Monica. Most of her clients were gay men and lesbians. In her later life she would be awarded with the Distinguished Contribution in the Public Interest Award. The University of Chicago opened the Evelyn Hooker Center for Gay and Lesbian Studies in her honor. She was also the subject of the 1992 Academy Award–nominated film &quot;Changing Our Minds: The Story of Dr. Evelyn Hooker&quot;.

Hooker died at her home in Santa Monica, California, in 1996, at the age of 89.

==Projective tests study==

Although Hooker had collected data about her homosexual friends since 1954, she felt this was of little value because of the lack of scientific rigor attached to the gathering of these data. She applied for a grant from the NIMH even though she was warned that it was highly unlikely she would receive it due to the controversy of the topic. After all, the 1950s was at the height of the McCarthy era, and homosexuality was considered to be a mental disorder by psychologists, a sin by the church, and a crime by the law. The man in charge of awarding the grants, John Eberhart, personally met with Hooker and, convinced by her charm, he awarded her the grant.

She gathered two groups of men: one group would be exclusively homosexual, the other exclusively heterosexual. She contacted the Mattachine Society to find a large portion of homosexual men. The Mattachine Society was an organization whose purpose was to integrate homosexuals into society. She had greater difficulty finding heterosexual men for the study. She gathered a sample of 30 heterosexual men and 30 homosexual men and paired them based on equivalent IQ, age, and education. For the interest of the study, it was required that none of the men from either group have previously been seen for psychological help, in disciplinary barracks in the armed services, in prison, showed evidence of considerable disturbance, or who were in therapy. She also had to use her home to conduct the interviews to protect the participants&#x27; anonymity.

Hooker used three projective psychological tests for her study: the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT), the Make-a-Picture-Story test (MAPS test), and the Rorschach inkblot test. The Rorschach was used due to the belief of clinicians at the time that it was the best method for diagnosing homosexuality.

After a year of work, Hooker presented a team of three expert evaluators with 60 unmarked psychological profiles. She decided to leave the interpretation of her results to other people, to avoid any possible bias.

First, she contacted Bruno Klopfer, an expert on Rorschach tests, to see if he would be able to identify the sexual orientation of people through their results at those tests. His ability to differentiate between the two groups was no better than chance. Then Edwin Shneidman, creator of the MAPS test, also analyzed the 60 profiles. It took him six months and he, too, found that both groups were highly similar in their psychological make-up. The third expert was Dr. Mortimer Mayer, who was so certain he would be able to tell the two groups apart that he went through the process twice.

The assumption was that these tests would prompt respondents to reveal their innermost anxieties, fears, and wishes. Each test response would be submitted in random order, with no identifying information, to Klopfer, Meyer, and Shneidman. The judges had two tasks: to arrive at an overall adjustment rating on a five-point scale, and to distinguish in pairs which participant was homosexual and heterosexual. The three evaluators concluded that in terms of adjustment, there were no differences between the members of each group.

In 1956, Hooker presented the results of her research in a paper at the American Psychological Association&#x27;s convention in Chicago. The NIMH was so impressed with the evidence Hooker found they granted her the NIMH Research Career Award in 1961 to continue her work.
Her studies contributed to a change in the attitudes of the psychological community toward homosexuality and to the American Psychiatric Association&#x27;s decision to remove homosexuality from its handbook of disorders in 1973. This in turn helped change the attitude of society at large. One element that did stay in the handbook of disorders was ego-dystonic homosexuality. Experts became concerned about using psychoanalytic approaches and behavior modification conversion therapy. In 1987 ego-dystonic homosexuality was also eliminated from the handbook when it was determined that psychological therapies could not cure homosexuality.

<text>Mammatus (also called mamma or mammatocumulus, meaning &quot;mammary cloud&quot;) is a cellular pattern of pouches hanging underneath the base of a cloud, typically a cumulonimbus raincloud, although they may be attached to other classes of parent clouds. The name &quot;mammatus&quot; is derived from the Latin &quot;&quot; (meaning &quot;udder&quot; or &quot;breast&quot;).

According to the WMO International Cloud Atlas, &quot;mamma&quot; is a cloud supplementary feature rather than a genus, species or variety of cloud. The distinct &quot;lumpy&quot; undersides are formed by cold air sinking down to form the pockets contrary to the puffs of clouds rising through the convection of warm air. These formations were first described in 1894 by William Clement Ley.

== Characteristics ==
Mammatus are most often associated with anvil clouds and also severe thunderstorms. They often extend from the base of a cumulonimbus cloud, but may also be found under altostratus, and cirrus clouds, as well as volcanic ash clouds. When occurring in cumulonimbus, mammatus are often indicative of a particularly strong storm. Due to the intensely sheared environment in which mammatus form, aviators are strongly cautioned to avoid cumulonimbus with mammatus as they indicate convectively induced turbulence. Contrails may also produce lobes but these are incorrectly termed as mammatus.

Mammatus may appear as smooth, ragged or lumpy lobes and may be opaque or translucent. Because mammatus occur as a grouping of lobes, the way they clump together can vary from an isolated cluster to a field of mammae that spread over hundreds of kilometers to being organized along a line, and may be composed of either unequal or similarly-sized lobes. The individual mammatus lobe average diameters of and lengths on average of . A lobe can last an average of 10 minutes, but a whole cluster of mamma can range from 15 minutes to a few hours. They are usually composed of ice, but also can be a mixture of ice and liquid water or be composed of almost entirely liquid water.

True to their ominous appearance, mammatus clouds are often harbingers of a coming storm or other extreme weather system. Typically composed primarily of ice, they can extend for hundreds of miles in each direction and individual formations can remain visibly static for ten to fifteen minutes at a time. They usually appear around, before, or even after severe weather.

== Hypothesized formation mechanisms ==


The existence of many different types of mammatus clouds, each with distinct properties and occurring in distinct environments, has given rise to multiple hypotheses on their formation, which are also relevant to other cloud forms.

One environmental trend is shared by all of the formation mechanisms hypothesized for mammatus clouds: sharp gradients in temperature, moisture and momentum (wind shear) across the anvil cloud/sub-cloud air boundary, which strongly influence interactions therein. The following are the proposed mechanisms, each described with its shortcomings:
* The anvil of a cumulonimbus cloud gradually subsides as it spreads out from its source cloud. As air descends, it warms. However, the cloudy air will warm more slowly (at the moist adiabatic lapse rate) than the sub-cloud, dry air (at the dry adiabatic lapse rate). Because of the differential warming, the cloud/sub-cloud layer destabilizes and convective overturning can occur, creating a lumpy cloud-base. The problems with this theory are that there are observations of mammatus lobes that do not support the presence of strong subsidence in the lobes, and that it is difficult to separate the processes of hydrometeor fallout and cloud-base subsidence, thus rendering it unclear as to whether either process is occurring.
* Cooling due to hydrometeor fallout is a second proposed formation mechanism. As hydrometeors fall into the dry sub-cloud air, the air containing the precipitation cools due to evaporation or sublimation. Being now cooler than the environmental air and unstable, they descend until in static equilibrium, at which point a restoring force curves the edges of the fallout back up, creating the lobed appearance. One problem with this theory is that observations show that cloud-base evaporation does not always produce mammatus. This mechanism could be responsible for the earliest stage of development, but other processes (namely process 1, above) may come into play as the lobes are formed and mature.
* There may also be destabilization at cloud base due to melting. If the cloud base exists near the freezing line, then the cooling in the immediate air caused by melting can lead to convective overturning, just as in the processes above. However, this strict temperature environment is not always present.
* The above processes specifically relied on the destabilization of the sub-cloud layer due to adiabatic or latent heating effects. Discounting the thermodynamical effects of hydrometeor fallout, another mechanism proposes that dynamics of the fallout alone are enough to create the lobes. Inhomogeneities in the masses of the hydrometeors along the cloud-base may cause inhomogeneous descent along the base. Frictional drag and associated eddy-like structures create the lobed appearance of the fallout. The main shortcoming of this theory is that vertical velocities in the lobes have been observed to be greater than the fall speeds of the hydrometeors within them; thus, there should be a dynamical downward forcing, as well.
* Another method, that was first proposed by Kerry Emanuel, is called cloud-base detrainment instability (CDI), which acts very much like convective cloud-top entrainment. In CDI, cloudy air is mixed into the dry sub-cloud air rather than precipitating into it. The cloudy layer destabilizes due to evaporative cooling and mammatus are formed. 
* Clouds undergo thermal reorganization due to radiative effects as they evolve. There are a couple of ideas as to how radiation can cause mammatus to form. One is that, because clouds radiatively cool (Stefan–Boltzmann law) very efficiently at their tops, entire pockets of cool, negatively buoyant cloud can penetrate downward through the entire layer and emerge as mammatus at cloud-base. Another idea is that as the cloud-base warms due to radiative heating from land surface&#x27;s longwave emission, the base destabilizes and overturns. This method is valid for only optically thick clouds. However, the nature of anvil clouds is that they are largely made up of ice, and are therefore relatively optically thin.
* Gravity waves are proposed to be the formation mechanism of linearly organized mammatus clouds. Indeed, wave patterns have been observed in the mammatus environment, but this is mostly due to gravity wave creation as a response to a convective updraft impinging upon the tropopause and spreading out in wave form over the entirety of the anvil. Therefore, this method does not explain the prevalence of mammatus clouds in one part of the anvil versus another. Furthermore, time and size scales for gravity waves and mammatus do not match up entirely. Gravity wave trains may be responsible for organizing the mammatus rather than forming them.
* Kelvin–Helmholtz (K–H) instability is prevalent along cloud boundaries and results in the formation of wave-like protrusions (called Kelvin-Helmholtz billows) from a cloud boundary. Mammatus are not in the form of K-H billows, thus, it is proposed that the instability can trigger the formation of the protrusions, but that another process must form the protrusions into lobes. Still, the main downfall with this theory is that K-H instability occurs in a stably stratified environment, and the mammatus environment is usually at least somewhat turbulent.
* Rayleigh–Taylor instability is the name given to the instability that exists between two fluids of differing densities, when the denser of the two is atop the less dense fluid. Along a cloud-base/sub-cloud interface, the denser, hydrometeor-laden air could cause mixing with the less-dense sub-cloud air. This mixing would take the form of mammatus clouds. The physical problem with this proposed method is that an instability existing along a static interface cannot necessarily be applied to the interface between two sheared atmospheric flows.
* The last proposed formation mechanism is that mammatus arise from Rayleigh–Bénard convection, where differential heating (cooling at the top and heating at the bottom) of a layer causes convective overturning. However, in this case of mammatus, the base is cooled by thermodynamical mechanisms mentioned above. As the cloud base descends, it happens on the scale of mammatus lobes, while adjacent to the lobes, there is a compensating ascent. This method has not proven to be observationally sound and is viewed as generally insubstantial.

This plenitude of proposed formation mechanisms shows, if nothing else, that the mammatus cloud is generally poorly understood.

<text>Beginning with the Industrial Revolution era, a workshop may be a room, rooms or building which provides both the area and tools (or machinery) that may be required for the manufacture or repair of manufactured goods. Workshops were the only places of production until the advent of industrialization and the development of larger factories. In the 20th and 21st century, many Western homes contained a workshop in either the garage, basement, or an external shed. Home workshops typically contain a workbench, hand tools, power tools, and other hardware. Along with the practical application of repairing goods, workshops are often used to tinker and make prototypes. 

Some workshops focus exclusively on automotive repair or restoration although there are a variety of workshops in existence today. Woodworking, metalworking, electronics, and other types of electronic prototyping workshops are among the most common.
==Backshop==
In some repair industries, such as locomotives and aircraft, the repair operations have specialized workshops called back shops or railway workshops. Most repairs are carried out in small workshops, except where an industrial service is needed.

<doc id="425447" wikidata="Q1066566" url="?curid=425447" title="LCD projector">
<text>An LCD projector is a type of video projector for displaying video, images or computer data on a screen or other flat surface. It is a modern equivalent of the slide projector or overhead projector. To display images, LCD (liquid-crystal display) projectors typically send light from a metal-halide lamp through a prism or series of dichroic filters that separates light to three polysilicon panelsone each for the red, green and blue components of the video signal. As polarized light passes through the panels (combination of polarizer, polysilicon LCD panel and analyzer), individual pixels can be opened (made transparent controlled by electricity) to allow light to pass or closed (made opaque controlled by electricity) to block the light. The combination of open and closed pixels can produce a wide range of colors and shades in the projected image. 

Metal-halide lamps are used because they output an ideal color temperature and a broad spectrum of color. These lamps also have the ability to produce an extremely large amount of light within a small area; current projectors average about 2,000 to 15,000 American National Standards Institute (ANSI) lumens. 

Other technologies, such as Digital Light Processing (DLP) and liquid crystal on silicon (LCOS) are also becoming more popular in modestly priced video projection.

==Projection surfaces==
Because they use small lamps and the ability to project an image on any flat surface, LCD projectors tend to be smaller and more portable than some other types of projection systems. Even so, the best image quality is found using a blank white, grey, or black (which blocks reflected ambient light) surface, so dedicated projection screens are often used.

Perceived color in a projected image is a factor of both projection surface and projector quality. Since white is more of a neutral color, white surfaces are best suited for natural color tones; as such, white projection surfaces are more common in most business and school presentation environments.

However, darkest black in a projected image is dependent on how dark the screen is. Because of this, some presenters and presentation-space planners prefer gray screens, which create higher-perceived contrast. The trade-off is that darker backgrounds can throw off color tones. Color problems can sometimes be adjusted through the projector settings, but may not be as accurate as they would on a white background.

==Throw ratio==
A projector&#x27;s throw ratio is used when installing projectors to control the size of the projected display. For example, if the throw ratio is 2:1 and the projector is fourteen feet away from the screen, then the display width will be seven feet.

==History==
Early experiments with liquid crystals to generate a video image were done by John A. van Raalte at the RCA-Laboratories in 1968. His concept was based on e-beam-addressing to generate an electronic charge pattern corresponding to a video image, which in turn controlled the LC layer of a reflective LC cell. E-beam-addressing requires a CRT with a modified faceplate to generate a charge pattern on its surface. No practical application of this concept for projection purposes is known. However, a similar concept was used for print heads without an LCD. 

The first experiments with a direct-driven, transmissive matrix-addressed LCD using a converted slide projector by Peter J. Wild working at Brown Boveri Research in Switzerland were conducted in 1971. A projector was shown in operation at the SID Conference 1972 in San Francisco. As direct-driven, passive LCDs (without thin-film transistors) at the matrix intersections) were not capable of displaying images with sufficient resolution for video pictures, a combination of a fixed image together with an LCD matrix for the variable elements was proposed as an LC projector for certain control room applications, with a corresponding patent filed in Switzerland on Dec. 3, 1971.

A lot of effort went into optimizing thin-film transistors (TFT) suitable for active matrix-addressed (AM) LCDs. The concept was invented and early trials were conducted by teams at RCA and Westinghouse Electric. T Peter Brody left Westinghouse and founded Panelvision in 1981 to manufacture AM LCDs. Breakthroughs occurred elsewhere in new materials and thin-film structures, with Hitachi of Japan as a pioneering company. Such AM LCDs became commercially available in the early 1980s.
Gene Dolgoff had the idea of using LCDs as light valves in projectors. However, he had to wait until 1984 to get a digitally-addressable LCD matrix device with sufficient resolution and contrast, which is when he completed building his LCD video projector. After building it, he saw many problems that had to be corrected including major light losses and very noticeable pixels (sometimes referred to as the &quot;screen-door effect&quot;). He then invented new optical methods to create efficient and bright projectors and invented depixelization to reduce the screen-door effect.
At about the same time, the German company &quot;Bonner Ingenieurbüro für Optoelektronik CrystalVision&quot; started experimenting with LCD projection devices from 1985 onwards. Although traditional slide projectors already used infrared filters to reduce heating of the photographic slides, LCDs are much more sensitive to overheating. When the temperature in the nematic liquid crystal layer reaches the &quot;clearing point&quot; (i.e. enters the isotropic phase), the LC light valve does not work anymore until the temperature drops below again. Bernt Haastert, an engineer working at CrystalVision, found out, that placing the required polarizing filters at a certain distance on both sides of the LC cell allowed for efficient air cooling of the arrangement. Without applying this invention, LCD projectors with a powerful light source don&#x27;t work. A commercial LCD projector based on this principle was launched in Germany in 1990 under the trade name &quot;Imagina 90&quot;.

With patents filed worldwide (filing his first LCD video projector patent application in 1987), Dolgoff started Projectavision, Inc. in 1988, as one of the world&#x27;s first dedicated LCD-projector companies, which he took public on Nasdaq in 1990. He licensed the technology to other companies including Panasonic and Samsung. Early pioneers of LCD projection in Japan were Epson and Sharp, which launched their own color video projector products in 1989.

In 1989, Projectavision, Inc. was awarded the first Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) contractfor US$1 millionfor proposing that the United States high-definition television (HDTV) standard should use digital processing and projection. As a member of the National Association of Photographic Manufacturers Standards Subcommittee, IT7-3, Dolgoff along with Leon Shapiro, co-developed the worldwide ANSI standard for measurement of brightness, contrast, and resolution of electronic projectors.

Since 2005, the only remaining manufacturers of the LCDs for LCD projectors are Japanese imaging companies Epson and Sony. Epson owns the technology and has branded it as &quot;3LCD&quot;. To market 3LCD projector technology, Epson also set up a consortium called the &quot;3LCD Group&quot; in 2005 with other projector manufacturer licensees of 3LCD technology that use it in their projector models.

Early LCD systems were used with existing overhead projectors. The LCD system did not have a light source of its own: it was built on a large &quot;plate&quot; that sat on top of the projector in place of transparencies. This provided a stop-gap solution in the era when the computer was not yet a universal display medium, creating a market for LCD projectors before their current main use became popular.

This technology was employed in some sizes of rear-projection television consoles when there was a cost advantages in mid-size sets (40- to 50-inch diagonal). In 2014, 60-inch 1080p flat panel televisions were less costly than a projector with 1080p native resolution. Projection systems were typically marketed as offering a diagonal image size of 100 to 300 inches.

In 2004 and 2005, LCD front projection began a comeback with the introduction of the dynamic iris and other modifications that have improved perceived contrast to levels similar to DLP.

The basic design of an LCD projector is frequently used by hobbyists who build their own DIY (do-it-yourself) projection systems. The basic technique is to combine a high color-rendering index (CRI) high-intensity discharge lamp (HID lamp) and ballast with a condenser and collector Fresnel lens, a single color LCD removed from a common computer display or electronic device and a triplet lens. This design can also be used in low cost (around US$200) LCD projectors.

<text>São Miguel Island (; ), nicknamed &quot;The Green Island&quot; (), is the largest and most populous island in the Portuguese archipelago of the Azores. The island covers and has around 140,000 inhabitants, with 45,000 people residing in Ponta Delgada, the archipelago&#x27;s largest city.

==History==
In 1427, São Miguel became the second of the islands discovered by Gonçalo Velho Cabral to be settled by colonists from continental Portugal. This date is uncertain, as it is believed that the island was discovered between 1426 and 1437 and inscribed in portolans from the middle of the 15th century. Its discovery was later recorded by Father Gaspar Frutuoso in the seminal history of the Azores, &quot;Saudades da Terra&quot;, as he began: &quot;This island of São Miguel where...we are, is mountainous and covered in ravines, and it was, when we discovered it, covered in trees...due to its humidity, with its water showers and ravines warm with sun...&quot;

It was sometime after the initial settlement of Povoação Velha (on the southeastern coast) that (between 1439 and 1444) a volcanic eruption occurred in the crater of Sete Cidades (then uninhabited). There are no records of the precise date, but Gaspar Frutuoso noted that navigators returning to São Miguel (soon after its discovery) encountered the western part of the island completely changed and tree trunks and pumice stone floating in the waters around the island. After docking in Povoação, the settlers reported feeling tremors and aftershocks; &quot;...those settlers living in their earthen holes of straw and hay, heard almost within a year a great loud noise, roars and snorts that came from the earth with large tremors still proceeded the subversion and fire from the peak that had disappeared.&quot;

In the early 15th century, Prince Henry the Navigator first authorized the settlement of the Azores, and many settlers from the historical provinces of Estremadura, Alto Alentejo, Algarve and Madeira travelled to São Miguel, under the &quot;Carta Régia&quot; (a decree of the regency). The fertile soils and temperate climate attracted settlers from other countries, notably French and Flemish people. Cultural minorities such as Sephardic Jewish New Christians are believed to have comprised as much as 30% of the island&#x27;s population. (i.e., many had surnames such as Pereira, Pimentel, Dias, Menezes, Oliveira, Nunes, Castro, Pinheiro, Rosa, Furtado, Ferreira, Lima, Fonseca, Machado, Franco, Elias, Teixeira, Duarte, Souza, Pacheco, Almeida, Cardoso, Mendes, Gouveia, Estrela, Carneiro, Melo, Morreira, Cruz, Figueira Mesquita, Josué, Salvador, Teles, Meira, Silva, Amorim, Alvarez, Brandão, Miranda, Mota, Ribeiro, Aguiar, Soares, Coelho, Carvalho, Gomes, Mascarenhas, Henriques, Rodrigues, Costa, Pinto etc.), Some Moors were also exiled to the island during the inquisition. Its geographic position and fertile soils permitted rapid economic development. The establishment of a military garrison made the island an obligatory port-of-call in the African and Asian commercial trade, while the export of sugar, and later orchil (a dye exported to Flanders for the making of cloth) stabilized the island&#x27;s export trade.

The first capital of the island was Vila Franca do Campo, which was devastated by the 1522 Vila Franca earthquake and landslides. The tragedy helped to elevate Ponta Delgada to the administrative and economic status of capital and business centre from 1546.

During the Portuguese succession crisis of 1580, the people from São Miguel won the naval Battle of Vila Franca against a French squadron that supported the claims of the pretender António, Prior of Crato.

With the Portuguese Restoration War (1640), the island regained its position as a commercial centre, establishing new contacts in Brazil, which was heavily colonized during this period. Some of the island&#x27;s historic buildings, including mansions and churches, date from this period; the island&#x27;s architectural expansion and developed came from revenues from the export of oranges, mainly to Great Britain.

In 1831, during the Liberal Wars, following the landing of troops loyal to Queen Maria II in Nordeste (sent by future Duke of Terceira), a resistance to the Absolutist regime on the Island was organized. In 1832, this militia declared allegiance to the Charter (constitutional monarchy) and Queen Maria, forming a contingent that sailed to the continent where they were involved in the liberation of Porto.

Following the Liberal Wars, the period of Devourism allowed the economy to flourish, and the port of Ponta Delgada expanded, through the export of new crops such as tea, pineapple, and tobacco. The development of the fishing industry, cultivation of food staples and expansion of the dairy industry permitted the growth of many of the population centres on the island.

Following the Carnation Revolution, the island received the seat of the Presidency of the Autonomous Region of the Azores, located in Ponta Delgada, while its economic, social and political importance continued to grow within the archipelago.

==Geography==
===Geology===

São Miguel is bisected by many faults from the northwest to southeast in the direction of the Terceira Rift, a triple junction of the African, Eurasian, and North American tectonic plates. This system is best expressed in the western part of the island with extensive geological formations, such as the Mosteiros Graben (along the western flank of the Sete Cidades Massif), the Ribeira Grande Graben (along the northern flank of the Água de Pau Massif), and the many cones and fissural structures along the interior of the island. In the ancient crater of Furnas the faults are aligned west-northwest to east-southeast. Zbysewsky (1959), among others (note references) identifies eight geomorphological structures on São Miguel that correspond to the formative features that built the island, including:

* The Sete Cidades Massif – an area that occupies the extreme western part of the island, and corresponds to a central volcanic crater and lake-filled caldera, with various cones, deposits of pumice, lava domes and maars. In the northeastern flank of this volcano the Mosteiros Graben, a tectonic structure created from the collapse of lands and located along a northwest to southeast orientation. Along other regional fractures and radial faults there are ancient spatter cones and lava domes;
* The Picos Volcanic System or Picos Region – is situated along a northwest–southeast alignment, and defines a range of spatter cones and relatively level ground between the Sete Cidades and the Água de Pau Massifs;
* The Água de Pau Massif – this central feature corresponds to the central volcano on the island, and includes the &quot;Lagoa do Fogo&quot; (Lake of Fire), many lava domes and pumice cones. On the northeastern flank of the Massif the Ribeira Grande Graben is visible, representing a tectonic depression oriented northwest to southeast;
* The Achada das Furnas Plateau – a region with a central plain marked by cones and maars, with deposits along a west-northwest to east-southeast and northwest to southeast;
* Furnas Volcano – located in the eastern part of the island, along the southern coast, and comprising two ancient calderas, occupied by a lake (&quot;Lagoa das Furnas&quot;). Within the system one can find many pumice cones, maars and lava domes;
* Povoação Volcano – comprising a central caldera, generally well-eroded and whose southern rim has disappeared to the southern coast. Within its interior, marked by several river-valleys and cliffs, are several spatter cones;
* The Tronqueira Region – it occupies the extreme easterly portion of the island and corresponds to a mountainous region, divided by many river-valleys that are usually delineated by tectonic fractures;
* The Northern Coastal Platform – located along the northeastern portion of the island, and marks a zone of relatively moderate topography, limited by the coast to the north and the northern crater rims of Furnas and Povoação volcanoes to the south.

São Miguel comprises six volcanic zones; all are Quaternary in age except the last, which is partly Pliocene. From west to east these zones are: the trachyte stratovolcano of the Sete Cidades Massif; a field of alkali-basalt cinder cones and lava flows with minor trachyte; the trachyte stratovolcano of the Água de Pau Massif; a field of alkali-basalt cinder cones and lava flows with minor trachyte and tristanite; the trachyte stratovolcano of Furnas; and the Nordeste shield, which includes the Povoação caldera and consists of alkali basalt, tristanite and trachyte. Dormancy ages for these regions include: 400 year for Sete Cidades, 145 for zone 2, 1150 for Água de Pau, and 370 for Furnas, while eruptions in the Nordeste have not occurred in the past 3000 years.


These geomorphological structures have resulted from millions of years of compound growth that began in the eastern portion of the island; around 4 million years ago the Nordeste Volcano burst from the ocean floor in effusive and fissural eruptions. These eruptions were composed of basaltic lava flows and spatter cones whose products reached a height of forming the mountainous region of Tronqueiro, Planalto dos Graminhais, Espigão dos Bois and Pico Verde (finding its maximum extent in Pico da Vara). But, about 950,000 years ago a secondary volcano system (Volcanic Complex of Povoação) supplanted the eruptions of the Nordeste Volcano, responsible for new basaltic lavas and pyroclastic deposits. With an age of 200,000 years the third volcano on São Miguel, the Água de Pau Volcano started erupting on the western flank of Povoação volcano in two phases. The first phase, composed of the older materials, erupted from lava flows and Trachyte pyroclasts, the secondary phase corresponded to volcanic products that began erupting 400,000 years ago. These latter deposits included pyroclastic, trachyte flows (lava and surges), mud flows and a mixture of basalts. In what would become the western portion of the island a fourth volcano formed: the Sete Cidades Volcano erupted 200,000 years ago and continued to erupt until about 36,000 years ago.

Between 100,000 and 3,800 years ago fissural eruptions of integrated lava and basaltic pyroclastic deposits occurred in the center of the island between Água de Pau and Povoação, forming the Fissural Volcanic System of Congro. These eruptions were explosive and fed by activities in the neighboring volcanic systems. At about 100,000 years a secondary system developed along the frontier of the Povoação volcano, the &quot;Furnas Volcano&quot; complex (the youngest volcanic system) in three phases mixing pyroclastic surges, trachytes, and lava flows, as well as explosive materials. Finally, two layers of deposits formed the Fissural Volcanic System of Picos between the volcanic Água de Pau and Sete Cidades from 31,000 years ago unifying the island. This formation integrated lavas, basaltic pyroclasts, tuff cones and trachyte domes into two layers (referred to as the Ponta Delgada and Penhal da Paz sub-deposits) and compiled to about 5,000 years ago.

The peak area between Sete Cidades and Fogo is a monogenetic volcanic field composed of 270 volcanoes. They are primarily made up of basaltic cones which were formed during Strombolian and Hawaiian-style eruptions. This is the part of the island with the most recent volcanic activity. The youngest volcanoes are relatively well dated. It is estimated that 19 eruptions have occurred during the last 3,000 years. Several eruptions have been witnessed and recorded by people. The last one took place in the 17th century. The most famous eruption is known as Fogo 2, which occurred in 1652.

===Biome===
The ancient &quot;laurisilva&quot; forest has mostly been replaced by cultivated fields and imported trees and plants, such as the ubiquitous cryptomeria trees. There are some hot springs (&quot;caldeiras&quot;), generally located in the center of the island, in the area stretching from Povoação to Nordeste. There is also an ocean hot spring called Ponta da Ferraria.

The highest elevation on São Miguel is the Pico da Vara at . Lying at the eastern end of the island, it is the focus of a Special Protection Area containing the largest remnant of laurisilva forest on the island, which is home to the endemic and critically endangered bird, the Azores bullfinch.

Whale watching tours, starting from Ponta Delgada and Vila Franca do Campo are available. One may see sea turtles, dolphins and humpback whales.

===Climate===
São Miguel has a mild maritime climate, which is drier in the summer and wetter in the winter, though according to the Köppen climate classification, four different climatic classifications can be found throughout the island. At lower elevations, the hot-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;) dominates over the Humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) typical of the more westerly islands and truly only found around Capelas. Above altitude, the Mediterranean climate transitions into its warm-summer variant (&quot;Csb&quot;), and past the climate is strictly oceanic (&quot;Cfb&quot;).

The western half of the island is generally drier, due to the lower topography. Precipitation varies from less than in the Northwest coastline between Mosteiros and Ajuda da Bretanha, to over around Pico da Vara in the east.

Similar to other islands in the archipelago, São Miguel is influenced by ocean currents and winds, and, in particular, the cyclonic Gulf Stream. This stream functions as a moderating force in the islands, keeping temperatures hovering between and throughout the year. The island&#x27;s location also makes it susceptible to some Atlantic storms, and precipitation tends to be elevated during the winter periods. Winters are very mild by European standards and summers are warm (sometimes very warm due to the high humidity) and relatively dry. Temperatures above or below have never been recorded at the coast.

===Human geography===

Owing to the predominance of volcanic cones and craters in the interior, human settlement has developed primarily along coastal and interior plains. In addition, there are several communities that have developed within ancient craters (such as Sete Cidades, Furnas or Povoação), river-valleys (such as Ribeira Chã, Pilar da Bretanha) or coastal deltas (Mosteiros). Regardless, these settlements were largely agrarian and concentrated around the parish churches and the many fertile parcels of land. The communities were largely isolated throughout the year, owing to the great distances and rough landscape of the island, and only became integrated with the development of the many road networks that circle and bisect the island. Two cities have developed, largely because the island was divided by mountainous volcanic cones in the interior: Ponta Delgada and Ribeira Grande. Administratively, the island is governed by five municipalities, with Ponta Delgada and Ribeira Grande having more administrative functions associated with their larger populations:
Lagoa, the youngest of the municipalities of São Miguel, has a population of about 14,126 inhabitants (2008 census), incorporating the south-central parishes east of Ponta Delgada;
Nordeste, literally the north-eastern municipality, well known for an abundance of natural vegetation and the highest point on the island, Pico da Vara;
Ponta Delgada, includes not only the industrial/commercial city of Ponta Delgada, but also many rural parishes, as well as the large crater of Sete Cidades;
Povoação, home to the first colony on the island, Povoação is located in the south-east corner of the island, and includes active and dormant volcanic features, including Furnas and the crater of Povoação;
Ribeira Grande, the second largest municipality, with approximately 30,852 inhabitants, received its charter in 1981, and incorporates an extensive area of the northern coast (including the parish of Rabo de Peixe, the largest parish by population); and
Vila Franca do Campo, once the seat of the historical capital of São Miguel (until it was almost destroyed by earthquake and landslides in 1522), it is located along the southern coast between Lagoa and Povoação.

Government is administered at the local level by the civil parish (), which are responsible for the provision of services and implementation of municipal initiatives. Based on the historical ecclesiastical limits established after settlement, the civil parishes are run by a president, treasurer and secretary (at the head of a parish council). These presidents have municipal council standing and represent their constituencies in the assemblies of the &quot;Câmara Municipal&quot;. On the island of São Miguel there are 64 local area authorities, that include:

==Transport==
Three bus routes operate in Ponta Delgada on weekdays from 07:00 to 19:00. Line A runs in the western part of town, line B in the central/north, and line C in the east. There are bus services between Ponta Delgada and most other towns on the island, but usually only a few times a day. City services and island-wide services are both accessible along &quot;Avenida D. Infante Henriques&quot; and conveniently accessible from major sites in Ponta Delgada. Up to date schedules are available at bus stops and the tourist office. Distances on the island are short with journeys rarely longer than 90 minutes.

Joao Paulo II Airport (Ponta Delgado Airport) provides airline connections to all of the islands of the Azores as well as to Madeira and the mainland (namely, Lisbon, Porto, and Faro) as well as numerous international destinations in Europe and North America.

<doc id="425452" wikidata="Q297855" url="?curid=425452" title="Cyaxares">
<text>Cyaxares was the third king of the Medes. He ascended to the throne in 625 BCE, after his father Phraortes lost his life in a battle against the Assyrians.

Cyaxares collaborated with the Babylonians to destroy the Assyrian Empire, and united most of the Iranian peoples of ancient Iran, thereby transforming Media into a major power.

==Name==
The name is the Latinised form of the Greek (), which was itself the Hellenisation of the Median name (), meaning &quot;good ruler.&quot;

The Greek author Diodorus Siculus named Cyaxares as (), which is the Hellenisation of the Median name , meaning &quot;spear bearer.&quot; This name is similar to the Median form of his son Astyages&#x27;s name, , meaning &quot;spear thrower.&quot;

== Life and reign ==
=== Scythian rule ===
According to Herodotus, Cyaxares was the son of the Median king Phraortes. In the middle of the 7th century BCE, Phraortes led the Medes in a revolt against Assyria and was killed in battle, either against the Assyrians under their king Ashurbanipal, or against the Assyrians&#x27; Scythian allies, whose king Madyes invaded the Medes and imposed Scythian hegemony over them for almost 
three decades years on behalf of the Assyrians, thus starting a period which Herodotus called the &quot;Scythian rule over Asia&quot;.

Following the Scythian invasion, Cyaxares succeeded his father Phraortes as king of the Medes under the suzerainty of the Scythians.

By the 620s BCE, the Assyrian Empire began to weaken after the death of Ashurbanipal: in addition to internal instability within Assyria itself, Babylon revolted against the Assyrians in 626 BCE. The next year, in 625 BCE, Cyaxares overthrew the Scythian yoke over the Medes by inviting the Scythian rulers to a banquet, getting them drunk, and then murdering them all, including possibly Madyes himself.

After freeing the Medes from the Scythian yoke, Cyaxares reorganised the Median armed forces in preparation for a war with Assyria: whereas the Medes previously fought as tribal militias divided into kinship groups and each warrior used whatever weapons they were the most skilled at, Cyaxares instituted a regular army modelled on the Assyrian and Urartian armies, fully equipped by the state and divided into strategic and tactical units. Cyaxares might also have forced the Scythians into an alliance with the Medes after overthrowing their rule, since from 615 BCE onwards the Babylonian records mention the Scythians as the allies of the Medes.

=== War in Parthia ===
At some point during his reign, Cyaxares conquered the countries of Hyrcania and Parthia, which were located to the immediate east of Media.

According to Diodorus Siculus, at one point the Parthians revolted against Cyaxares and entrusted their country and their capital city to the Sacae or the Dahae, after which a war broke out between the Medes and the Saka, led by their queen Zarinaia, who founded multiple cities. According to Diodorus, Zarinaia was the sister of the Saka king Cydraeus and initially his wife, but after his death she married the Parthian king Marmares. During the war against the Medes, Zarinaia was wounded in battle and captured by Cyaxares&#x27;s son-in-law Stryngaeus, who listened to her pleas and spared her life; when Marmares later captured Stryngaeus, Zarinaia killed Marmares, and rescued Stryngaeus. At the end of this war, the Parthians accepted Median rule, and peace was made between the Medes and the Saka.

Diodorus&#x27;s account suggests that the region of Parthia was influenced by both the Medes to their west, and by the Saka nomads of the region of the Caspian and Aral Seas.

=== War against Assyria ===
Following the defeat of a joint Assyrian-Mannaean force at Gablinu by the new Babylonian rebel king and founder of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, Nabopolassar, the next year Cyaxares conquered Mannae, which brought the Median armies to the frontiers of Assyria. In November 615 BCE, six months after Nabopolassar had failed to seize the important Assyrian centre of Assur, Cyaxares crossed the Zagros mountains and occupied the city of Arrapha. The next year, in July and August of 614 BCE, the Median armies performed a distractive manoeuvre by ostensibly marching on the Assyrian capital of Nineveh, which prompted the Assyrian king Sinsharishkun to go defend the city, after which the Medes marched north along the Tigris and seized Tarbiṣu, following which they crossed the river and marched down its right bank to Assur, and thereby cut the Assyrian centres of Nineveh and Kalhu from outside help. Then the Median forces attacked and conquered Assur, during which the Medes&#x27; forces massacred the city&#x27;s inhabitants, destroyed its temples, and seized its treasures.

Shortly after the fall of Assur, the Babylonian king Nabopolassar met Cyaxares at the ruins of the city, and they concluded an alliance against Assyria which was sealed by diplomatic marriages, with Nabopolassar&#x27;s son Nebuchadnezzar II marrying Cyaxares&#x27;s daughter Amytis, and Cyaxares marrying a daughter or granddaughter of Nabopolassar.

Once the alliance between Cyaxares and Nabopolassar had been concluded, the Median and Babylonian forces acted in concert with each other in the war against Assyria. In 612 BCE, the Median and Babylonian armies together crossed the ʿAdhaim river at its mouth and marched on the Assyrian capital city, Nineveh, which was taken and sacked by the joint Medo-Babylonian forces after three months of siege. The Assyrian king Sinsharishkun likely died during the fall of Nineveh.

After the death of Sinsharishkun, an Assyrian leader who might have been his son, Ashur-uballit II, proclaimed himself the new Assyrian king in Harran, where he ruled with the support of the remnant of the Assyrian army. In 610 BCE, the pro-Assyrian Egyptian pharaoh Necho II intervened in the Levant in support of the Assyrians, and went to Harran to support Ashur-uballit. In 610 BCE, Cyaxares and Nabopolassar seized Harran from the Assyro-Egyptian force, which retreated to Carchemish on the west bank of the Euphrates.

According to older interpretations of the destruction of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, its territory was partitioned between the Babylonians and the Medes, the latter of whom obtained a territory which included Assyria proper and had a southern border which started at Carchemish and passed south of Harran and along the Jabal Sinjār till the Tigris to the south of Assur, and then along the Jabāl Hamrīn and across the Diyala River valley until the northwestern borders of Elam. However, according to more recent research, the Neo-Babylonian Empire obtained all of the former territories of the Assyrian Empire except for those on the Zagros mountains which the Assyrians had already lost to the Medes in earlier times, and the role of the Medes in the war against the Assyrians was largely to act as the main fighting force which handed over territory to the Babylonians and returned to Media once these military activities were completed.

=== Conquest of Urartu ===
In 609 BCE, the Medes attacked the capital of the kingdom of Urartu in the Armenian Highlands. The attack on Urartu might have been carried out in alliance with the Babylonians, since Babylonian records mention a joint Medo-Babylonian attack on Bit Hanunia in Urartu in 608 BCE, and a splinter Scythian group likely joined the Medes and participated in their conquest of Urartu. This invasion did not result in the destruction of Urartu, but in it becoming a subject kingdom of the new Median state. Median contingents might have helped the final Babylonian victory against the joint Assyrian-Egyptian force at Carchemish in 605 BCE, at which point the Medes&#x27; military collaboration with the Babylonian campaigns ended, and Median forces did not participate in any of the consequent Babylonian campaigns in Syria and Palestine.

===War against the Lydians===
Following the destruction of the Assyrian Empire, the majority of the Scythians were expelled frmo Western Asia and into the Pontic Steppe during the 600s BCE, and the relations between the Medes and the Babylonians soon temporarily deteriorated in the 590s. The deuterocanonical Book of Judith describes a battle in 593 BC. between King Nebuchadnezzar II and Arphaxad (thought to be another name for Cyaxares).

Later, a war broke out between Media and another group of Scythians, probably members of a splinter group who had formed a kingdom in what is now Azerbaijan. These Scythians left Median-ruled Transcaucasia and fled into the kingdom of Lydia, which had been allied to the Scythians. After the Lydian king Alyattes refused to accede to Cyaxares&#x27;s demands that these Scythian refugees be handed to him, a war broke out between Media and the Lydian Empire in 590 BCE. 

This war lasted five years, until a solar eclipse known as the Eclipse of Thales occurred in 585 BCE, during which a battle was fought between the Lydian and Median armies. Hence, this battle became known as the Battle of the Eclipse. Both sides interpreted the eclipse as an omen to end the war. The kings of Babylon and Cilicia acted as mediators in the ensuing peace treaty, which was sealed by the marriage of Cyaxares&#x27;s son Astyages with Alyattes&#x27;s daughter Aryenis.

The border between Lydia and Media was fixed at a yet undetermined location in eastern Anatolia; the Graeco-Roman historians&#x27; traditional account of the Halys River as having been set as the border between the two kingdoms appears to have been a retroactive narrative construction based on symbolic role assigned by Greeks to the Halys as the separation between Lower Asia and Upper Asia as well as on the Halys being a later provincial border within the Achaemenid Empire.

===Death===
Cyaxares died in the Battle of the Eclipse, in 585 BCE itself, and was succeeded by his son Astyages. The Russian historian Igor Diakonoff has tentatively suggested that the tomb of Cyaxares might be located at the place now called Qyzqapan, in the mountains of present-day Iraqi Kurdistan in Sulaymaniyah.

== Legacy ==
After Darius I seized power in the Achaemenid Empire, rebellions erupted claiming Cyaxares&#x27;s legacy. After these were defeated, Darius noted two in the Behistun Inscription:
&quot;Another was Phraortes, the Mede; he lied, saying: &#x27;I am Khshathrita, of the dynasty of Cyaxares.&#x27; He made Media to revolt. Another was Tritantaechmes, the Sagartian; he lied, saying: &#x27;I am king in Sagartia, of the dynasty of Cyaxares.&#x27; He made Sagartia to revolt.&quot; One of the options that has sparked deep debate regarding the reign of Cyaxares is Zoroastrianism. The question of when the prophet Zoroaster lived and to which years the Avesta belongs still awaits an empirical answer.

<doc id="425454" wikidata="Q954488" url="?curid=425454" title="Corvo Island">
<text>Corvo Island (, , ) is the smallest and the northernmost island of the Azores archipelago and the northernmost in Macaronesia. It has a population of 435 inhabitants (as of 2023) making it the smallest single municipality in the Azores and in Portugal. The island lies on the North American Plate.

==History==
The documented history of the Azores originates with non-official exploration during the period of the late 13th century, resulting in maps, such as the Genovese Atlas Medici from 1351, which mentions obscure islands in an undefined Atlantic archipelago. The Medici Atlas refers to an &quot;Insula Corvi Marini&quot; (&quot;Island of the Marine Crow&quot;; &quot;marine crow&quot; is the literal translation of &quot;Corvo Marinho&quot;, which is the Portuguese name for the cormorant), in a seven-island archipelago, but it is improbable that it refers specifically to Corvo, although the island&#x27;s name could have originated from this atlas. It is likely that the name referred to the two islands of Corvo and Flores, which also appeared on the later Aragonese &quot;Mapa Catalão&quot; of 1375.

The navigator Diogo de Teive discovered both islands of the Azores&#x27; Western Group on his 1452 return from the Banks of Newfoundland following his second voyage of exploration. The Portuguese royal chronicles state that when Teive arrived, he found a statue of a man on horseback, standing on a plinth bearing an inscription in an alphabet they did not understand. An attempt was subsequently made to remove the statue to Portugal, which led to its destruction. This account, alongside a hoard of coins which contemporary documents state were unearthed on the island in 1749, has led to speculation that the island was discovered by the Carthaginians c. 200 BC.

Subsequently, the Portuguese Court, when referring to the new &quot;Ilhas das Flores&quot; (&quot;Islands of Flowers&quot;), began to identify Corvo as &quot;Ilha de Santa Iria&quot; (&quot;Island of Saint Irene&quot;), but other nautical charts continued to refer to this island as &quot;Ilhéu das Flores&quot; (&quot;Islet of Flowers&quot;), &quot;Ilha da Estátua&quot; (&quot;Island of the Statue&quot;), &quot;Ilha do Farol&quot; (&quot;Island of the Lighthouse&quot;) or &quot;Ilha de São Tomás&quot; (&quot;Island of Saint Thomas&quot;). For a while it was also known as &quot;Ilha do Marco&quot; (Island of the Mark), which was attributed to its reference as a geographic marker for sailors, or, likely, the location of a small promontory where a marker was placed, which received the name &quot;Ponta do Marco&quot;.

Unsuccessful attempts at settlement of the island occurred in the following years; not until 1580 did a permanent settlement become viable.

A religious parish of Corvo was finally constituted in 1674, and then on 20 June 1832, integrated into a functioning civilian administration.

==Geology and geography==
The island is located on the North American Plate, west of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge on a sea-mount of approximately 1.5-1.0 million years age. The islands of Corvo and Flores emerged from a submarine mount oriented along a north-northeast to south-southwest line, while Corvo is controlled by faults oriented north to south, parallel to the mid-Atlantic Ridge, and transform faults oriented west to east which crosscut secondary cones on the outer slopes. The island formed from a 5 km diameter central volcano (Monte Gorde) that emerged around 730,000 years ago, whose central cone was approximately in altitude. The crater collapsed 430,000 years ago during a Plinian eruption, forming a subsidence caldera ( in diameter and depth), referred to as the &quot;Caldeirão&quot;. Within the caldera are several cinder and spatter cones ( in height) giving rise to small lakes, peat bogs, and islets (two long and five rounded). The highest point on the island, the Morro dos Homens, crowns the southern rim of the Caldeirão at above sea level.

Two main volcanic complexes are usually recognized:
*The Basal Complex – the oldest formative structures, that includes pyroclastic submarine tuff cones, around the southwest and northern sea cliffs. In some areas, specifically along the western, northern and north-east, the island is cut by faults extending from the Upper Complexes;
*The Upper Complex (Complex Superior 1 and 2) – divided into two volcanic units of pre- and post-caldera episodes; the Complex 1 (or pre-caldera) is represented by sub-aerial volcanism, characterized by both explosive and effusive volcanism. This phase is characterized by a succession of basaltic lavas in the base, and developing into mixture of basaltic and Hawaiian lavas in later phases. The secondary (Complex 2) formations occupy 90% of the island, and pertain to the central caldera, including pumice and explosive particulars that are a mixture of escoria lava of a basaltic and Hawaiian in nature. The most recent of the deposits correspond to pyroclastic and phreatomagmatic pyroclastic material associated with secondary cones.

While the initial phases were dominated by basaltic lava flows and pyroclastic deposits, the final phase was characterized by pumice, surges, lahars, and pyroclastic flows characteristic of Plinian and sub-Plinian eruptions.

Sheer cliffs dominate the coastal areas, the exception being along the southern margin which is composed of ancient lava flows. The western cliffs, with an almost vertical slope rises above sea level; one of the major coastal elevations in the Atlantic. Remnants of the ancient volcano are partially preserved in the southern and eastern flanks of the island (which retain altitudes between above sea level). In addition to marine erosion, the island is constantly eroded by strong northeast and western winds. In the south, secondary cinder cones, such as Coroinha, Morro da Fonte, Grotão da Castelhana and Coroa do Pico, are visibly preserved with little erosion, and responsible for many basaltic flows that formed the southern lava fajã ( above sea level). The last eruption took place about 80–100,000 years ago in the vicinity of Vila Nova do Corvo.

In the extreme northeast, along the Ponta Torrais there are two small islets, Ilhéu dos Torrais and the Ilhéu do Torrão, in addition to several submarine reefs, that are dangerous to navigation. At the end of October 2012, following several days of excess rainfall, a landslide occurred that dislodged geological debris along the northwestern corner of the island, resulting in the formation of small islets, that progressively transformed into a peninsula and, finally a fajã.
==Environment==

===Ecoregions/Protected areas===
The Corvo Nature Park was created under Regional Legislative Decree 44/2008/A, on 5 November 2008, in order to conserve and protect species habitat and natural resources on the island. It includes principally two categories, and associated areas of intervention:
;Protected Areas for the Management of Habitats and Coastal Species
*[COR01] Protected Area of the Caldera of Corvo () 
;Protected Areas for the Management of Resources
*[COR02] Protected Resource Area of the Coast of Corvo ()

===Important Bird Area===
The islands of Corvo and neighbouring Flores, along with the surrounding waters, form the 210,400 ha Corvo and Flores Important Bird Area (IBA), designated as such by BirdLife International because it provides feeding and breeding sites for populations of Cory&#x27;s, little and Manx shearwaters, as well as roseate and common terns, and, possibly, Madeiran storm petrels.

==Climate==
According to Köppen, Corvo has a humid subtropical climate. As is the case with other western Azorean islands, the climate is very humid and mild to warm year-round due the effects of the Gulf Stream, with around of precipitation annually near the coast and reaching at the highest altitudes, comfortable although generally windy. Average temperatures are around in Vila do Corvo, varying between in the winter to in the summer. Fog is common and almost permanent at higher elevations (and is referred to as the &quot;Fogs of São João&quot;). Due to maritime agitation, particularly on the western coast, there is elevated abrasion along the coast. Relative humidity is around 80% year-round.
==Human settlement==

There is one urban center on the island: Vila do Corvo. Principally, it is a collection of many residential homes, interspersed with commercial businesses located on the southern one-third of the island. Functionally, by law, Vila do Corvo is the only Portuguese top-level municipality without a civil parish. The urbanized area is divided between the village, the airport, and the island&#x27;s ports (being the primary links to the other islands in the archipelago). The lands immediately around the settlement are small zones along the eastern coast (Quintas and Fojo) that can sustain cultivation of some crops and fruit trees, and where some older trees have survived settlement; the best pasture-lands are located in the north in the zone of Terras Altas.
The southern coast, referred to as Enseada de Nossa Senhora do Rosário, is the location of three ports, constructed at various times for diverse needs: Porto Novo (currently not utilized), the Porto do Boqueirão and Porto da Casa (the largest and the island&#x27;s commercial port). Portinho da Areia, on the extreme west of the southern coast (at the end of the airport&#x27;s runway) is the only beach and principal swimming area on the island.

===Economy===
Subsistence agriculture has predominated on the island since it was first settled. It currently occupies 17.5% of the area of the municipality, and concentrated on small parcels in the eastern half of the island and along the northern parts of Vila do Corvo. In this patchwork of volcanic hedge-rows, farmers concentrate on semi-permanent crops (potatoes, some cereals, including wheat and citrus orchards).

Dairy production is the primary activity, and cheese is one of the primary commercialized products, although the raising of pigs and poultry is also common. Until the 1960s, the raising of sheep and the commercialization of wool was also important on the island. This was until a change in forestry policy forced many farmers to vacate uncultivated lands, lands that were routinely used to graze sheep. It was quickly the end of the wool industry on the island, an industry that had been integral to the island&#x27;s small export industry.

===Transport===
The island is served by the Corvo Airport , located on the southern margin of the island between the village and southern ocean ports. Inter-island flights are handled by SATA Air Açores: there are no direct flights to Corvo from outside the archipelago. Since the 1990s, the airport has been serviced by one Bombardier Dash 8 Q200 aircraft, big enough to handle the low volume of traffic to the island (weather permitting). These flights have since been operated by alternating DeHavilland Dash 8 aircraft, as part of the fleet revitalization program of the late 20th century.

<doc id="425457" wikidata="Q4044426" url="?curid=425457" title="Models (band)">
<text>Models (also sometimes known as The Models) are an Australian rock band formed in Melbourne, Victoria in August 1978. They went into hiatus in 1988, but re-formed in 2000, 2006 and 2008 to perform reunion concerts. The band began regularly performing again from 2010 onwards. &quot;Out of Mind, Out of Sight&quot;, their only No. 1 hit, appeared on the Australian singles charts in July 1985. The related album, &quot;Out of Mind, Out of Sight&quot;, peaked at No. 3 on the Australian albums charts after its release in August. &quot;Out of Mind, Out of Sight&quot; appeared on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart, with the single, &quot;Out of Mind, Out of Sight&quot;, peaking at No. 37 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart. An earlier song from the same album, &quot;Barbados&quot;, had peaked at No. 2 on the Australian singles chart.

Models early line-up included Andrew Duffield on keyboards, Mark Ferrie on bass guitar, Janis Freidenfelds (a.k.a. Johnny Crash) on drums and percussion, and Sean Kelly on vocals and lead guitar. A later line-up was mainstay Kelly on guitar, James Freud on vocals and bass, Roger Mason on keyboards, Barton Price on drums, and James Valentine on saxophone. Backing singers in the group included Zan Abeyratne and Kate Ceberano (both from I&#x27;m Talking) and Canadian-born Wendy Matthews. In early 1989, Duffield, Kelly, Matthews and Valentine were members of Absent Friends. On 27 October 2010, Models were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame by Matthews.

==History==
===1977–1979: Early years===
In 1977 Melbourne school friends Sean Kelly and James Freud formed their first band, Spread, which was soon renamed Teenage Radio Stars. They recorded two tracks for Suicide records&#x27; &quot;Lethal Weapons&quot; compilation album (1978).

Singer and guitarist Sean Kelly left in 1978 to form Models with bass guitarist Peter Sutcliffe (a.k.a. Pierre Voltaire and Pierre Sutcliffe, who won $503,000 in May 2014, on Australian TV quiz show &quot;Million Dollar Minute&quot;) and Ash Wednesday (formerly of JAB on keyboards, Sutcliffe and Janis Friedenfelds (a.k.a. Johnny Crash) on drums and percussion. Models were more pop influenced than the earlier punk bands and had a wider appeal. The initial version of the group did not stay together for long as, after six months, Sutcliffe was replaced on bass by Mark Ferrie (ex-Myriad). In August 1979, Wednesday was replaced by Andrew Duffield from Whirlywirld on keyboards. Their first release in October 1979 was a give-away, shared single, &quot;Early Morning Brain (It&#x27;s Not Quite the Same as Sobriety)&quot; backed with The Boys Next Door&#x27;s &quot;Scatterbrain&quot;. Friction within the band led to their decision to break up in November 1978. However they rapidly reformed at the end of December when ex-The Easybeats members, Harry Vanda and George Young, who were now record producers and songwriters, offered to cut some demos for them – Their second single, &quot;Owe You Nothing&quot; appeared in August 1980. Both singles were released on independent labels and did not chart on the Top 40 Australian singles chart according to the Kent Music Report.

===1980–1982: &quot;Alphabravocharliedeltaechofoxtrotgolf&quot; to &quot;Local and/or General&quot;===
Models performed extensively both locally and interstate, supporting the Ramones, The B-52&#x27;s, XTC, The Vapors and Midnight Oil on national tours. Rather than signing immediately, the group financed the recording of their first album to guarantee creative control. In November 1980, the Duffield, Ferrie, Friedenfelds and Kelly line-up released their first album, &quot;Alphabravocharliedeltaechofoxtrotgolf&quot;. They then, under manager Adrian Barker, signed to Mushroom Records and, as a sign of its respect for the band, the label agreed not to release any singles from the album, which peaked at No. 43 on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart. It was well received by audiences on the live pub circuit. The group intended to record completely new material for their studio albums. Much of their earlier work was unreleased until 2002, when &quot;Models Melbourne&quot;, a compilation album of live material, was released.

Models&#x27; early style was a spiky, distinctive blend of new wave, glam rock, dub and pop: which included Kelly&#x27;s strangled singing voice, Duffield&#x27;s virtuoso synthesiser performances (he used the EMS Synthi AKS), and the band&#x27;s cryptic, slightly gruesome, lyrics (e.g., &quot;Hans Stand: A War Record&quot; from &quot;Alphabravocharliedeltaechofoxtrotgolf&quot;), which were mostly written or co-written by Kelly.

Early in 1981, following a support slot for The Police, the group signed an international deal with A&amp;M Records. Friedenfelds was replaced on drums by Mark Hough (a.k.a. Buster Stiggs) from New Zealand band The Swingers before recording commenced on their international label release. Friedenfields went on to play with Sacred Cowboys, Beasts of Bourbon, The Slaughterman and Tombstone Hands. The band went to England to record with producer, Stephen Tayler producing. at Farmyard Studios, these tracks becoming the album &quot;Local and/or General&quot;.

In June, demo sessions recorded earlier in Australia so impressed the band that they were released as a 10&quot; mini album, &quot;Cut Lunch&quot; (July 1981), which was produced by Tony Cohen and Models except one by Split Enz keyboard player Eddie Rayner. &quot;Cut Lunch&quot; peaked at No. 37 on the albums chart and at No. 38 on the singles chart. It included the whimsical pop tune, &quot;Two Cabs to the Toucan&quot;.

In October, their second full-length album &quot;Local &amp;/or General&quot;, was released. &quot;Local and/or General&quot; peaked at No. 30 and provided the single, &quot;Local &amp;/or General&quot; in November, which did not chart.

Both albums helped widen their audience nationally, thanks to regular radio exposure on Triple J in Sydney and on community stations in other cities, as well as national TV exposure through their innovative music videos on programs such as the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC-TV) pop music show &quot;Countdown&quot;.

During 1982, further line-up changes occurred with Ferrie and Hough leaving early in the year. Ferrie went on to form Sacred Cowboys with Garry Gray and Terry Doolan. He later (as of November 2010) became bass player in the &quot;RocKwiz&quot; house band on SBS TV. Hough became a graphic artist, art director and designer. James Freud (ex-Teenage Radio Stars, James Freud &amp; Berlin) joined the band on bass and vocals, with John Rowell on guitar and Graham Scott on drums (both ex-Curse). Kelly and Freud had been in high school bands which developed into Teenage Radio Stars. Freud had a solo hit single, &quot;Modern Girl&quot;, which peaked at No. 12 in 1980. Rowell and Scott left Models in May 1982, with Duffield following. New Zealand drummer, Barton Price (ex-Crocodiles, Sardine v) joined. They recorded a single, &quot;On&quot;, produced by veteran rocker, Lobby Loyde, and released in August. It had no mainstream chart success, but peaked at No. 1 on the independent charts. Gus Till (ex-Beargarden) briefly joined on keyboards until Duffield rejoined in December. In 1982 they made a film, &quot;Pop Movie&quot;, which featured animation and live footage of the band, it was screened on TV rock show, &quot;Nightmoves&quot;, as well as at a few cinemas.

===1983–1985: &quot;The Pleasure of Your Company&quot; to &quot;Out of Mind, Out of Sight&quot;===
Models&#x27; line-up of Duffield, Freud, Kelly and Price issued the highly regarded &quot;The Pleasure of Your Company&quot; in October 1983, produced by Nick Launay. Its big drum sound and dance-ability, reflected Launay&#x27;s influence, and Freud&#x27;s more radio-friendly voice made the album more accessible. The album was critically acclaimed and peaked at No. 12, with the single &quot;I Hear Motion&quot; becoming a No. 16 hit. Duffield later explained that the song&#x27;s distinctive keyboard part had been inspired by a riff from Stevie Wonder&#x27;s hit &quot;Superstition&quot;. &quot;I Hear Motion&quot; was used on the soundtrack for the Yahoo Serious film &quot;Young Einstein&quot; (1988). The band released two other singles, &quot;God Bless America&quot; and &quot;No Shoulders, No Head&quot;, but neither charted into the Top 50. The band supported David Bowie for the Australian leg of his Serious Moonlight Tour in November. Kelly and Duffield were invited to sing backing vocals on the INXS album, &quot;The Swing&quot;. The video for &quot;God Bless America&quot;, from March 1984, featured backing singers Zan Abeyratne and Kate Ceberano (both members of I&#x27;m Talking). Kelly appeared ready to disband Models and was even rehearsing with a new band. Mushroom Records convinced him to continue with Models and their next single, &quot;Big on Love&quot; produced by Reggie Lucas, was released in November 1984 and peaked at No. 24.

Fellow Australian band INXS were fans of Models; their manager, Chris Murphy signed them to his MMA management company. The group created a hybrid of their alternative roots with a more commercial sound and, under the influence of Murphy, they reassessed their direction and moved towards a more radio-friendly format. By late 1984, Models relocated to Sydney and Duffield – with his crucial influence on the band&#x27;s sound – was forced out by Murphy under acrimonious circumstances to be replaced by Roger Mason (ex-James Freud&#x27;s Berlin) on keyboards and James Valentine on saxophone. Duffield released a solo album, &quot;Ten Happy Fingers&quot; in 1986 on his own Retrograde Records label. For touring during 1983 to 1985, the group was regularly augmented by backing singers Abeyratne and Ceberano; and in 1985, Canadian-born singer Wendy Matthews joined. Matthews and Kelly became a couple, remaining together for 11 years, and later founded the band Absent Friends.

In early 1985, Models started recording material for their next album, &quot;Out of Mind, Out of Sight&quot;, produced by Launay, Lucas and Mark Opitz. A single from the album, &quot;Barbados&quot;, was released in March, which peaked at No. 2. It was a reggae influenced song co-written by Freud and Duffield (prior to his departure). The song related a tale of alcoholism and suicide, it later provided Freud with the titles of his two autobiographies, &quot;I Am the Voice Left from Drinking&quot; (2002) and &quot;I Am the Voice Left from Rehab&quot; (2007). The video clip was influenced by the film, &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;, it included a cameo by Garry Gary Beers of INXS and was directed by Richard Lowenstein.

On 13 July, Models performed four songs for the Oz for Africa concert (part of the global Live Aid program) – &quot;Big on Love&quot;, &quot;I Hear Motion&quot;, &quot;Stormy Tonight&quot;, &quot;Out of Mind, Out of Sight&quot;. It was broadcast in Australia (on both Seven Network and Nine Network) and on MTV in the United States. Models went on a national tour with I&#x27;m Talking in July. In November, the band appeared on The Royal Variety Performance for Prince Charles and Princess Diana – Rocking the Royals at the Victoria State Arts Centre. The band released their most commercially successful work with the No. 1 hit single &quot;Out of Mind, Out of Sight&quot; in June and the No. 3 album &quot;Out of Mind, Out of Sight&quot; in August. &quot;Out of Mind, Out of Sight&quot; was the only No. 1 single on the Australian singles chart for 1985 by an Australian artist. (Midnight Oil&#x27;s &quot;Species Deceases&quot; which peaked at No. 1 on the singles charts in December 1985 was an EP.) For the album, Models were Freud, Kelly, Mason, Matthews, Price and Valentine with Zan Abeyratne, and her twin sister, Sherine Abeyratne (Big Pig) on backing vocals.

&quot;Cold Fever&quot; released in October was their next single, which peaked into the Top 40. It was followed by a Christmas single, &quot;King of Kings&quot;, which contains portions of a speech by Martin Luther King Jr., issued in December with all proceeds donated to the Salvation Army, but it did not chart into the Top 50. In 1986, Geffen Records released &quot;Out of Mind, Out of Sight&quot; in the US and it appeared on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart, with the single, &quot;Out of Sight, Out of Mind&quot;, peaking at No. 37 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart. The band toured the US in November supporting Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark.

===1986–1988: &quot;Models&#x27; Media&quot; to dissolution===

In 1986, Models went to UK to record their next album, &quot;Models&#x27; Media&quot;, with Julian Mendelsohn and Opitz, at Trevor Horn&#x27;s state-of-the-art SARM West Studios in London. Two singles peaked into the Top 30, &quot;Evolution&quot; in September, and &quot;Let&#x27;s Kiss&quot; in November. &quot;Models&#x27; Media&quot; was released in December and peaked at No. 30 but was less successful than &quot;Out of Mind, Out of Sight&quot;. Models also featured on the Australian Made Tour of late 1986 to January 1987 with INXS, Mental as Anything, The Triffids, I&#x27;m Talking, The Saints, Divinyls and Jimmy Barnes on the ticket. &quot;Hold On&quot; was released in March 1987 and peaked in the Top 30, their final single was a cover of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Oh! Darling&quot; in September which peaked in the Top 50.
During 1987, Ceberano and Matthews sang together on the soundtrack for ABC-TV series, &quot;Stringer&quot;, the resultant album, &quot;You&#x27;ve Always Got the Blues&quot; was released in 1988, and peaked at No. 4 on the albums chart. Models members, including Mason as lead singer and Kelly on bass guitar, formed a side-project, The Clampetts, to record covers of nine country music tracks, which was released in 1987 as &quot;The Last Hoedown&quot;. Valentine left Models to pursue a radio and television journalism career.

In 1988, the Thank You Goodnight Tour was conducted but the pressures of ten years of touring, as well as financial troubles, hastened the break-up of Models, which was announced in June 1988, however in 2008, Kelly disputed the break-up: 

===1988–current: post-dissolution and reunions===
Models&#x27; extended live exposure ensured that they stayed in the public eye when other contemporaries had been forgotten: the band&#x27;s later work remained popular on radio throughout the 1990s; this, coupled with critical acclaim and cult appeal of earlier work, re-stimulated interest in their work in the latter half of that decade. The band reformed for a few gigs in 2000; in 2001 their rarities album &quot;Melbourne&quot; was released. Freud has written two memoirs, &quot;I Am The Voice Left From Drinking&quot; (2002) and &quot;I Am The Voice Left From Rehab&quot; (2007); the titles are both taken from &quot;Barbados&quot; and allude to his addiction with drugs and alcohol, and his subsequent recovery attempts.

Kelly and Matthews formed Absent Friends in early 1989 which included ex-Models members Duffield, Mason and Valentine. With Matthews on lead vocals their 1990 hit single, &quot;I Don’t Want to Be with Nobody but You&quot; peaked at No. 4 on the ARIA Charts. The associated album, &quot;Here&#x27;s Looking Up Your Address&quot; peaked at No. 7. Absent Friends disbanded in 1991 and Kelly fronted The Dukes from 1991 to 1994. Matthews provided a No. 11 hit with her first solo album &quot;Émigré&quot; late in 1990. She followed with &quot;Lily&quot;, which peaked at No. 2 in 1992, and provided her best performed single, &quot;The Day You Went Away&quot;, which also peaked at No. 2. Former drummer Scott was a member of Satellite (1993–1997). Matthews and Kelly separated as a couple in the mid-1990s.

Duffield wrote music (including the theme) for the Australian children&#x27;s TV series, &quot;Round the Twist&quot;; and in 2007 composed all music and sound effects for the TV comedy, &quot;Kick&quot;. Duffield teamed up with Phil Kennihan to found a successful advertising music partnership.

Mason has composed soundtracks for many feature films and television series both locally and internationally. Valentine later worked in children&#x27;s TV, is a popular radio host on 702 ABC Sydney and published a successful series of children&#x27;s books. Price returned to New Zealand after stints with various Australian bands, and the world&#x27;s first drum sample CD. Wednesday formed Crashland and plays with German avant garde band Einstürzende Neubauten.

Various versions of Models have reformed on several occasions for short tours, including in 2006 and in September 2008. The 2008 version was: Kelly, Freud, his son Jackson Freud (from Attack of the Mannequins) on guitar, Tim Rosewarne (ex-Big Pig, Chocolate Starfish) on keyboards and Cameron Goold (Propaganda Klann, Christine Anu backing band) on drums. In August 2010, Duffield, Ferrie, Kelly and Price reformed for two concerts in Sydney and Melbourne. On 27 October, Models were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame by Matthews. The line-up of Duffield, Ferrie, Kelly, Mason, Price and Valentine performed &quot;I Hear Motion&quot; and &quot;Evolution&quot;. Matthews recalled meeting the group for the first time at a recording session – she was due to provide backing vocals but they were busy playing indoor cricket in the studio. During the ceremony, Kelly explained Freud&#x27;s absence by saying he had &quot;another bicycle accident&quot;. A week later, Freud was found dead at his Hawthorn home on 4 November in a suspected suicide.

In 2013, Models (consisting of Duffield, Ferrie, Kelly, and Price) issued a self-released four-song EP titled &quot;GTK&quot;. A follow-up EP was issued in 2015: titled &quot;Memo&quot;, it also consisted of four songs.

<text>The year 1829 in [[science]] and technology involved some significant events, listed below.

==Chemistry==
* Isaac Holden produces a form of friction match.

==Mathematics==
* Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet publishes a memoir giving the Dirichlet conditions, showing for which functions the convergence of the Fourier series holds; introducing Dirichlet&#x27;s test for the convergence of series; the Dirichlet function as an example that not any function is integrable; and, in the proof of the theorem for the Fourier series, the Dirichlet kernel and Dirichlet integral. He also introduces a general modern concept for a function.
* Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky publishes his work on hyperbolic non-Euclidean geometry.
* S. D. Poisson publishes &quot;Sur l&#x27;attraction des sphéroides&quot;.

==Medicine==
* Dr Benjamin Guy Babington makes the first known use of a laryngoscope.

==Palaeontology==
* Jules Desnoyers names the Quaternary period.
* Engis 2, part of the skull of a young child and other bones, recognised in 1936 as the first known Neanderthal fossil, is found in the Awirs cave near Engis in the United Kingdom of the Netherlands (modern-day Belgium) by Philippe-Charles Schmerling.

==Technology==
* May – Cyrill Demian patents a version of the accordion in Vienna.
* June 30 – Henry Robinson Palmer files a British patent application for corrugated iron for use in buildings.

<doc id="425464" wikidata="Q424744" url="?curid=425464" title="Fibrate">
<text>In pharmacology, the fibrates are a class of amphipathic carboxylic acids and esters. They are derivatives of fibric acid (phenoxyisobutyric acid). They are used for a range of metabolic disorders, mainly hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol), and are therefore hypolipidemic agents.

==Medical uses==
Fibrates improve atherogenic dyslipidemia characterized by high triglyceride and/or low HDL-C levels and elevated concentrations of small dense LDL particles, with or without high LDL-C levels. Fibrates may be compared to statin drugs, which reduce LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and have only limited effects on other lipid parameters. Clinical trials have shown that the combination of statins and fibrates results in a significantly greater reduction in LDL-C and triglyceride levels and greater increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) compared with monotherapy with either drug. Fibrates are used in accessory therapy in many forms of hypercholesterolemia, but the combination of some fibrates (e.g., gemfibrozil) with statins is contraindicated due to an increased risk of rhabdomyolysis.

Fibrates stimulate peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) alpha, which controls the expression of gene products that mediate the metabolism of triglycerides (TG) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). As a result, synthesis of fatty acids, TG and VLDL is reduced, whilst that of lipoprotein lipase, which catabolises TG, is enhanced. In addition, production of Apo A1 and ATP binding cassette A1 is up-regulated, leading to increased reverse cholesterol transport via HDL. Consequently, fibrates reduce TG by up to 50% and increase HDL-C by up to 20%, but LDL-C changes are variable.
Fewer large-scale trials have been conducted with fibrates than with statins and the results are less conclusive, but reduced rates of cardiovascular disease have been reported with fibrate therapy in the subgroup of patients with low HDL-C levels and elevated TG (e.g. TG &gt; 2.3 mmol/L (200 mg/dL)). Fibrates are usually well tolerated but share a similar side-effect profile to statins. In addition, they may increase the risk of cholelithiasis and prolong the action of anticoagulants. Accumulating evidence suggests that they may also have a protective effect against diabetic microvascular complications.

Clinical trials do support their use as monotherapy agents. Fibrates reduce the number of non-fatal heart attacks, but do not improve all-cause mortality and are therefore indicated only in those not tolerant to statins.

Although less effective in lowering LDL levels, the ability of fibrates to increase HDL and lower triglyceride levels seems to reduce insulin resistance when the dyslipidemia is associated with other features of the metabolic syndrome (hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2). They are therefore used in many hyperlipidemias. Due to a rare paradoxical decrease in HDL-C seen in some patients on fenofibrate, as per US FDA label change, it is recommended that the HDL-C levels be checked within the first few months after initiation of fibrate therapy. If a severely depressed HDL-C level is detected, fibrate therapy should be withdrawn, and the HDL-C level monitored until it has returned to baseline.

==Side effects==
Most fibrates can cause mild stomach upset and myopathy (muscle pain with CPK elevations). Fibrates decrease the synthesis of bile acid by down-regulation of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase and sterol 27-hydroxylase expression, therefore making it easier for cholesterol to precipitate and increasing the risk for gallstones.

In combination with statin drugs, fibrates cause an increased risk of rhabdomyolysis, idiosyncratic destruction of muscle tissue, leading to kidney failure. The less lipophilic statins are less prone to cause this reaction, and are probably safer to be combined with fibrates than the more lipophilic statins are.

Drug toxicity includes acute kidney injury.

==Pharmacology==
Although used clinically since at least 1962, the mechanism of action of fibrates remained unelucidated until the 1990s, when it was discovered that fibrates activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), especially PPARα. The PPARs are a class of intracellular receptors that modulate carbohydrate and fat metabolism and adipose tissue differentiation.

Activating PPARs induces the transcription of a number of genes that facilitate lipid metabolism.

Fibrates are pharmacologically related to the thiazolidinediones, a novel class of anti-diabetic drugs that also act on PPARs (more specifically PPARγ)

Fibrates are a substrate of (metabolized by) CYP3A4.

Fibrates have been shown to extend lifespan in the roundworm &quot;C. elegans&quot;.

<doc id="425467" wikidata="Q267508" url="?curid=425467" title="Propositional attitude">
<text>A propositional attitude is a mental state held by an agent or organism toward a proposition. In philosophy, propositional attitudes can be considered to be neurally-realized causally efficacious content-bearing internal states (personal principles/values). Linguistically, propositional attitudes are denoted by a verb (e.g. &quot;believed&quot;) governing an embedded &quot;that&quot; clause, for example, &#x27;Sally believed that she had won&#x27;.

Propositional attitudes are often assumed to be the fundamental units of thought and their contents, being propositions, are true or false from the perspective of the person. An agent can have different propositional attitudes toward the same proposition (e.g., &quot;S believes that her ice-cream is cold,&quot; and &quot;S fears that her ice-cream is cold&quot;). Propositional attitudes have directions of fit: some are meant to reflect the world, others to influence it.

One topic of central concern is the relation between the modalities of assertion and belief, as well as intention. A person&#x27;s assertions may not conform to their beliefs. When the departure of assertion from belief is intentional, it is called a &quot;lie&quot;.

Other comparisons of multiple modalities that frequently arise are the relationships between belief and knowledge and the discrepancies that occur among observations, expectations, and intentions. Deviations of observations from expectations are commonly perceived as &quot;surprises&quot;, phenomena that call for &quot;explanations&quot; to reduce the shock of amazement.

==Issues==

In logic, the formal properties of verbs like &quot;assert&quot;, &quot;believe&quot;, &quot;command&quot;, &quot;consider&quot;, &quot;deny&quot;, &quot;doubt&quot;, &quot;imagine&quot;, &quot;judge&quot;, &quot;know&quot;, &quot;want&quot;, &quot;wish&quot;, and a host of others that involve attitudes or intentions toward propositions are notorious for their to analysis.
(Quine 1956).

===Indiscernibility of identicals===
One of the fundamental principles governing identity is that of substitutivity, also known as fungibility — or, as it might well be called, that of &quot;indiscernibility of identicals&quot;. It provides that, &quot;given a true statement of identity, one of its two terms may be substituted for the other in any true statement and the result will be true&quot;. It is easy to find cases contrary to this principle. For example, the statements:

:(1) Giorgione = Barbarelli,
:(2) Giorgione was so called because of his size.
are true; however, replacement of the name &quot;Giorgione&quot; by the name &quot;Barbarelli&quot; turns (2) into the falsehood:
:(3) Barbarelli was so called because of his size.
Quine&#x27;s example here refers to Giorgio Barbarelli&#x27;s sobriquet &quot;Giorgione&quot;, an Italian name roughly glossed as &quot;Big George.&quot; The basis of the paradox here is that while the two names signify the same individual (the meaning of the first statement), the names are not themselves identical; the second statement refers to an attribute (origin) that they do not share.

==Overview==

Bertrand Russell introduced the idea of handling propositions like this:

How one feels about or regards a proposition is different than what a proposition is – they can be accepted, asserted, believed, commanded, contested, declared, denied, doubted, enjoined, exclaimed, or expected, for example. Different attitudes toward propositions are called &quot;propositional attitudes&quot;; they are also discussed under the headings of &quot;intentionality&quot; and &quot;linguistic modality&quot;.

Many problematic situations in real life arise from the circumstance that many different propositions in many different modalities are in the air at once. In order to compare propositions of different colours and flavours, as it were, there is no basis for comparison but to examine the underlying propositions themselves, returning to matters of language and logic. Despite the name, propositional attitudes are not regarded as psychological attitudes proper, since the formal disciplines of linguistics and logic are concerned with nothing more concrete than what can be said in general about their formal properties and their patterns of interaction.

As the mess officer of Yossarian&#x27;s squadron, Minderbinder is an entrepreneur during World War II, &quot;perhaps the best known of all fictional businessmen&quot; in American literature. The Minderbinder character is a &quot;bittersweet parody&quot; of the American dream, both a &quot;prophet of profit&quot; and the &quot;embodiment of evil&quot;. Minderbinder also appears in Heller&#x27;s 1994 sequel &quot;Closing Time&quot;.

== Character information ==
Milo Minderbinder is the mess officer at the United States Army Air Corps base who becomes obsessed with expanding mess operations (in which he and everyone else &quot;has a share&quot;). 

Minderbinder, unlike most characters in &quot;Catch-22&quot;, who are the subject of only one chapter, is the subject of three chapters (Chapter 22: &quot;Milo the Mayor&quot;, Chapter 24: &quot;Milo&quot; and Chapter 35: &quot;Milo the Militant&quot;). He is one of the main characters in the novel. His most interesting attributes are his complete amorality without self-awareness, and his circular logic in running his Syndicate.

=== The Syndicate ===
Minderbinder&#x27;s enterprise becomes known as &quot;M&amp;M Enterprises&quot;, with the two M&#x27;s standing for his initials and the &quot;&amp;&quot; added to dispel any idea that the enterprise is a one-man operation. Minderbinder travels across the world, especially around the Mediterranean Sea, trying to buy and sell goods at a profit, primarily through black market channels. Everyone has a &quot;share&quot;, a fact which Minderbinder uses to defend his actions, stating that what is good for the company is good for all. For example, he secretly replaces the CO2 cartridges in the emergency life vests with printed notes to the effect that what is good for M&amp;M is good for the country.

Eventually, Minderbinder begins contracting missions for the Germans, fighting on both sides in the battle at Orvieto, and bombing his own squadron at Pianosa. At one point Minderbinder orders his fleet of aircraft to attack the American base where he lives, killing many American officers and enlisted men. He finally gets court-martialed for treason. However, as M&amp;M Enterprises proves to be incredibly profitable, he hires an expensive lawyer who is able to convince the court that it was capitalism which made America great, and is absolved only by disclosing his enormous profit to the investigating congressional committee.

In typical &quot;Catch-22&quot; satirical fashion, Minderbinder&#x27;s business is incredibly profitable, with the single exception of his decision to buy all Egyptian cotton in existence, which he cannot unload afterwards (except to other entrepreneurs, who sell the cotton back to him, because he simply ordered all Egyptian cotton) and tries to dispose of the cotton by coating it with chocolate and serving it in the mess hall. Later, Yossarian gives Minderbinder the idea of selling the cotton to the government, quoting Calvin Coolidge&#x27;s assertion that &quot;the business of government is &#x27;business&#x27;.&quot;

The exact size of Minderbinder&#x27;s syndicate is never specified. At the beginning of the novel, it is merely a system that gets fresh eggs to his mess hall by buying them in Sicily for one cent, selling them to Malta for four and a half cents, buying them back for seven cents, and finally selling them to the mess halls for five cents. However, the syndicate is soon revealed to have become a large company, and then an international syndicate, making Minderbinder the Mayor of Palermo, Assistant Governor-General of Malta, Shah of Oran, Caliph of Baghdad, mayor of Cairo, and the god of corn, rain, and rice in various pagan African countries. Whenever Minderbinder appears in one of his cities, an impromptu holiday with parades forming around him are declared.

=== Relationship to Yossarian ===
Minderbinder tends to trust the novel&#x27;s protagonist Yossarian more than he trusts anyone else because Yossarian — an unselfish man of principle — is so unlike himself. After learning that Yossarian can have all the dried fruit he wants, which he then gives to friends in the squadron, Minderbinder decides that he can be trusted because &quot;anyone who would not steal from the country he loved would not steal from anyone.&quot; However, he continually ignores Yossarian&#x27;s pleas for help because of his preoccupation with running M&amp;M Enterprises. He ultimately betrays Yossarian by striking a deal with Colonel Cathcart: Yossarian&#x27;s squadron must fly additional missions, and Minderbinder gets the credit. When Nately&#x27;s Whore&#x27;s Kid Sister, a young girl for whom Yossarian comes to care deeply, goes missing, Minderbinder agrees to help him find her, but abandons the attempt in order to smuggle illegal tobacco.

== In other media ==
Minderbinder is portrayed by Jon Voight in the 1970 film adaptation of the novel, and by Daniel David Stewart in the 2019 TV miniseries. The Minderbinder character of the miniseries comes across as more sympathetic and less tyrannical than the earlier representation in the 1970 film or the original in the 1961 book, at least in his personal interactions with Yossarian. He gets the position of mess officer after pitching lamb chops to Major _____ de Coverley in the first episode. His ultra-capitalist business undertakings are taken even further, with M&amp;M presented as ″an unstoppable enterprise″. A running gag is that whenever he explains how he accomplishes his grandiose tasks to other characters, often involving technical acts of treason, it is drowned out and censored by background noise.

== Literary significance ==
Joseph Heller intentionally seeded &quot;Catch 22&quot; with &quot;anachronisms like loyalty oaths, helicopters, IBM machines and agricultural subsidies&quot;, all of which only appear in the McCarthy Era, in order to create a more contemporary atmosphere. Likewise, Heller created Minderbinder&#x27;s famous saying &quot;What&#x27;s good for Milo Minderbinder, is good for the country&quot; (insert Syndicate or M&amp;M Enterprises for Milo Minderbinder) as a parody of Charles E. Wilson, who is often misquoted as saying &quot;What is good for General Motors is good for our country&quot; during a hearing of a Senate subcommittee in 1952. Wilson was the head of General Motors in 1952, but became Secretary of Defense in January 1953, thus being an early example of the military-industrial complex, which the Minderbinder character well represents.

According to Heller, he modeled the character traits of Minderbinder — fast-talking, self-promoting, thoroughly conscienceless — on his Coney Island childhood friend Marvin Winkler (or Beansy to friends). Winkler is described at length in Heller&#x27;s 1998 memoir &quot;Now and Then&quot;.

Milo Minderbinder has become an archetypal unabashed war profiteer in the American novel, similar to Charles Holt in the 1863 novel &quot;The Days of Shoddy&quot; by Henry Morford, and the later characters Marcus Hubbard in the Lillian Hellman play &quot;Another Part of the Forest&quot;, Joe Keller in the Arthur Miller play &quot;All My Sons&quot; and Noah Rosewater in the Kurt Vonnegut novel &quot;God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater&quot;.

<doc id="425474" wikidata="Q2236765" url="?curid=425474" title="Mental substance">
<text>Mental substance, according to the idea held by dualists and idealists, is a non-physical substance of which minds are composed. This substance is often referred to as consciousness.

This is opposed to the materialists, who hold that what we normally think of as mental substance is ultimately physical matter (i.e., brains).

Descartes, who was most famous for the assertion &quot;I think therefore I am&quot;, has had a lot of influence on the mind–body problem. He describes his theory of mental substance (which he calls res cogitans distinguishing it from the &quot;res extensa&quot;) in the &quot;Second Meditation&quot; (II.8) and in &quot;Principia Philosophiae&quot; (2.002).

He used a more precise definition of the word &quot;substance&quot; than is currently popular: that a substance is something which can exist without the existence of any other substance. For many philosophers, this word or the phrase &quot;mental substance&quot; has a special meaning.

Gottfried Leibniz, belonging to the generation immediately after Descartes, held the position that the mental world was built up by monads, mental objects that are not part of the physical world (see &quot;Monadology&quot;).

According to Descartes, God first created eternal truths and then the world from nothing, governing it with His divine providence. He took special care of human creatures, placing innate ideas in their thought, starting with the ideas of perfection and infinity.

The distinction between res cogitans and res extensa was taken up in Spinoza&#x27;s &quot;Ethics, according to which Thought and Extension are two infinite attributes of the one divine Substance. Soul and body are in turn two finite modes of Thought and Extension.

<text>David Nathaniel Baker Jr. (December 21, 1931 – March 26, 2016) was an American jazz composer, conductor, and musician from Indianapolis, as well as a professor of jazz studies at the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music. Baker is best known as an educator and founder of the jazz studies program. From 1991 to 2012, he was conductor and musical and artistic director for the Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orchestra. He has more than 65 recordings, 70 books, and 400 articles to his credit.

He received the James Smithson Medal from the Smithsonian Institution, an American Jazz Masters Award, a National Association of Jazz Educators Hall of Fame Award, a Sagamore of the Wabash award, and a Governor&#x27;s Arts Award from the State of Indiana. Baker also held leadership positions in several arts and music associations. The Indiana Historical Society named Baker an Indiana Living Legend in 2001. The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts named him a Living Jazz Legend in 2007.

==Early life and education==
David Nathaniel Baker Jr. was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, on December 21, 1931, to Patress Lasley Baker and David N. Baker Sr., a postal carrier. His siblings included two sisters, Shirley and Clela, and a brother, Archie.

Baker attended Indianapolis Public Schools and graduated from Crispus Attucks High School, a segregated public school for African American students. He continued his education at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana, where he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in music education in 1953 and a master&#x27;s degree in music education in 1954. Baker also studied with J. J. Johnson, János Starker, and George Russell and attended the Lenox School of Jazz in Lenox, Massachusetts, from 1959 to 1960 on a scholarship.

==Marriage and family==
Baker eloped from Missouri, where he began working as a university professor in 1955, to Chicago, Illinois, to marry Eugenia (&quot;Jeanne&quot;) Marie Jones. Baker and his first wife, Jeanne, were the parents of a daughter, April. The marriage ended in divorce. Baker had a granddaughter, Kirsten, and a great-grandson, Dylan. Baker&#x27;s second marriage was to flautist Lida Belt.

==Career==
Trained as a music educator and trombonist, Baker spent the early part of his career in the 1940s and 1950s as a jazz musician, performing and recording in the United States and in Europe. A facial injury suffered in an automobile accident in 1953 ended his career as a trombonist, but Baker switched to cello and turned his attention to teaching and musical composition. In 1966 he joined the music faculty at Indiana University in Bloomington, where he established the school&#x27;s jazz studies program. He was later named an IU distinguished professor and chair of the university&#x27;s Jazz Studies department in the Jacobs School of Music. In addition, he became one of the co-musical directors of the Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orchestra in 1991. He composed music, mostly on commission, and wrote hundreds of scholarly works related to music. He was active in numerous musical arts organizations.

===Early years===
After earning his master&#x27;s degree from Indiana in 1954, he began teaching at Lincoln University in Jefferson City, Missouri, in 1955. Lincoln, a historically black institution, had recently begun to admit white students to diversify its student body; however, Baker had to resign from his teaching position after he married Eugenia (&quot;Jeanne&quot;) Marie Jones, a white opera singer, due to Missouri&#x27;s anti-miscegenation laws. One of his students at Lincoln was the composer John Elwood Price. Baker returned to Indiana and taught private music lessons in Indianapolis and performed in local bands. He did not resume his academic teaching career until 1966.

===Musical performer===
Baker began performing as a trombonist in Indianapolis during high school and college. He played in clubs along Indiana Avenue, the heart of the city&#x27;s jazz scene of the late 1940s and early 1950s, with Jimmy Coe, Slide Hampton, J. J. Johnson, and Wes Montgomery. He mentored Freddie Hubbard and Larry Ridley. He later credited the Hampton family, especially noted jazz trombonist Slide Hampton, for mentoring him in his early years. The Hamptons let him and other local musicians rehearse with their family&#x27;s jazz band at their Indianapolis home.

During the 1950s Baker played in several big bands, including Lionel Hampton&#x27;s orchestra. After moving to California in 1956, he played with the West Coast jazz orchestras of Stan Kenton and Maynard Ferguson before returning to Indianapolis to lead his jazz band for two years. He performed in clubs across the United States, including the Five Spot Café in New York City with George Russell in the late 1950s. In 1960 he toured Europe as a member of Quincy Jones&#x27;s band. He also performed in Canada, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand during his more than sixty-year career.

Baker abandoned the trombone after a car accident in 1953 injured his jaw, but he began learning to play the cello in the early 1960s. Although he played trombone on the George Russell Sextet&#x27;s album &quot;Ezz-thetics&quot; (1961), after sustaining the injury, Baker switched to cello for Charles Tyler&#x27;s album, &quot;Eastern Man Alone&quot; (1967). Baker was also able to play trombone with Russell&#x27;s orchestra on &quot;Living Time&quot; (1972), a collaboration with Bill Evans, before the jaw injury finally caused him to give up the trombone and focus on teaching and composition.

Baker is credited on sixty-five recordings, including performances on two of Russell&#x27;s albums, &quot;Stratusphunk&quot; (1960) and &quot;The Stratus Seekers&quot; (1962). Beginning in the 1990s he performed with his second wife, Lida Belt Baker, a classically trained flautist.

===Music educator and author===
Although he began as a performer on trombone and cello, Baker is better known for his fifty-year career as a professor of jazz music and for his published works and musical compositions. Because his facial injury in 1953 largely ended the performing aspect of his career, he returned to his home state of Indiana and began a period of increased interest in musical composition and pedagogy.

In 1966 he began teaching at the Jacobs School of Music of Indiana University, where he established a jazz studies program. He was the music school&#x27;s second African American faculty member and its sole jazz studies instructor for his first ten years at the school. The jazz studies curriculum was approved as a degree program in 1968, a time when only about a dozen American universities taught jazz as an academic discipline.

Baker eventually became an IU Distinguished Professor of Music, serving as chair of the Jazz Studies department from 1968 to 2013 and as an adjunct professor in the African American and African Diaspora Studies department. His work as an educator helped make IU a highly regarded school for students of jazz. His students included Michael Brecker, Randy Brecker, Pharez Whitted, Peter Erskine, Jim Beard, Chris Botti, Shawn Pelton, Jeff Hamilton, and Jamey Aebersold.

Baker was among the first to codify the largely aural tradition of jazz. He is credited with writing 70 books, including several on jazz, such as &quot;Jazz Styles &amp; Analysis – Trombone: A History of the Jazz Trombone Via Recorded Solos&quot; (1973), &quot;Jazz Improvisation&quot; ( 1988), and &quot;David Baker&#x27;s Jazz Pedagogy&quot; (1989). He is also credited with writing 400 articles.

===Composer===
Baker&#x27;s compositions are often cited as examples of third stream jazz, although they included traditional jazz, chamber music, sonatas, film scores, and symphonic works. He is credited with writing more than 2,000 compositions, including his concerto &quot;Levels&quot; (1973) which received a Pulitzer Prize nomination, and the musical score for the PBS documentary film &quot;For Gold and Glory&quot; (2003), which won him an Emmy Award.

Baker&#x27;s best-known composition, which also received significant media attention, was Concertino for Cell Phones and Orchestra, a commission from Chicago Sinfonetta. Baker&#x27;s other compositions include a tribute to Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, a violin concerto for Josef Gingold, a flute concerto for James Pellerite, as well as Cello Concerto (1975), which he dedicated to cellist János Starker, and &quot;Ode to Starker&quot; (1999).

He received over 500 commissions from individuals and ensembles, including compositions that he wrote for Gingold, Starker, Ruggiero Ricci, Harvey Phillips, trumpeter David Coleman, the New York Philharmonic, the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra, the Beaux Arts Trio, the Fisk Jubilee Singers, and the Audubon Quartet, in addition to the Louisville Symphony, Ohio Chamber Orchestra, and the International Horn Society. Other musical groups have recorded his compositions. The Buselli–Wallarab Jazz Orchestra&#x27;s album &quot;Basically Baker&quot; (2005) includes interpretations of his compositions, many of them written for big bands and ensembles.

==Later years==
In 1991, in addition to his work at IU, Baker and Gunther Schuller became the artistic and musical directors of the Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orchestra, which was founded in 1990. Five years later Baker became its sole artistic and musical director. He concluded his time with the orchestra in 2012 as maestro emeritus. Among the orchestra&#x27;s notable performances under Baker&#x27;s leadership was a concert in Egypt in 2008 when it played at the Cairo Opera House, the Alexandra Opera House, and at the Pyramids.

==Death and legacy==
Baker died on March 26, 2016, at the age of eighty-four in Bloomington from complications due to Parkinson&#x27;s disease and Lewy body dementia.

In the 1960s he introduced jazz studies as academic discipline at Indiana University. It was accepted as an academic degree program in 1968, making it one of the earliest to be established in an American university. In addition to chairing IU&#x27;s Jazz Studies department from 1968 to 2013, he served as musical and artistic director of the Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orchestra from 1991 to 2012. In these roles he became a leader and mentor to the next generation of jazz musicians.

<text>Geoffrey Squires (born 16 November 1942, in Derry, Northern Ireland) is an Irish poet who works in what might loosely be termed the modernist tradition.

==Early life==
While born in Derry, he grew up in County Donegal, Republic of Ireland. He read English at Cambridge, and gained a PhD in multi-media instructional systems in adult education from the University of Edinburgh in 1970. During his career, Squires translated poems that were written in the Persian language and French language. His early work was influenced by the poetry and poetics of Charles Olson.

==Later life==
Between the mid 1970s and mid 1990s, Squires wrote poetry and submitted education journal articles. By the 2000s, Squires began working for the University of Hull in charge of their education department while also working as a reader. He is now retired and lives in Hull. American poet and critic Robert Archambeau has described his work as &#x27;a poetry of immediate consciousness&#x27;. His more recent writings show the effect of the study of Maurice Merleau-Ponty&#x27;s theory of perception.

Desnoyers was born at Nogent-le-Rotrou, in the department of Eure-et-Loir. Becoming interested in geology at an early age, he was one of the founders of the Geological Society of France in 1830. In 1834, he was appointed librarian of the Muséum National d&#x27;Histoire Naturelle in Paris. He was elected a Foreign Member of the Geological Society of London in 1864. Parts of his collection of rare books in the earth sciences was bought by the United States Geological Survey Library at an auction in 1885. He was the Secretary of the Historical Society since its founding.

==Speleological activities==
Desnoyers was a spelunker. His article on caves for the &quot;Dictionnaire universel d’histoire naturelle&quot; (1841-1849) of Charles Henry Dessalines d&#x27;Orbigny broke new ground, emphasizing the role of hydrological phenomena in limestone and gypsum caves. He explored the subterranean quarries of the Île-de-France. He was one of the first to study small mammals that lived in zones of karstic infill.

==Works==
His contributions to geological science comprise memoirs on the Jurassic, Cretaceous and Tertiary Strata of the Paris Basin and of Northern France, and other papers relating to the antiquity of man, and to the question of his co-existence with extinct mammalia. In 1829 he proposed the term &quot;Quaternary&quot; to cover those formations which were formed just anterior to the present, following an antiquated method of referring to geologic eras as &quot;Primary,&quot; &quot;Secondary,&quot; &quot;Tertiary,&quot; and so on.

His separate books were &quot;Sur la Craie et sur les terrains tertiaires du Cotentin&quot; (1825) and &quot;Recherches géologiques et historiques sur les cavernes&quot; (1845).

<text>Matthew Roy Kenseth (born March 10, 1972) is an American former professional stock car racing driver and the current competition advisor for Legacy Motor Club in the NASCAR Cup Series. Most recently, he raced part-time in the Superstar Racing Experience (SRX), driving the No. 8 car. Kenseth is also an active competitor at Slinger Speedway, where he holds the record for the most Slinger Nationals victories.

Kenseth began his racing career on Wisconsin&#x27;s short tracks, where he claimed track championships at Madison International Speedway, Slinger Super Speedway, and Wisconsin International Raceway. He later advanced to compete in the ARTGO, American Speed Association, and Hooters Late Model touring series. Eventually, he secured a full-time ride in the NASCAR Busch Series (now Xfinity Series) with former Wisconsin short-track rival Robbie Reiser, finishing second and third in the series standings during his tenure.

Kenseth advanced to the NASCAR Winston Cup Series, earning Rookie of the Year honors in 2000 and winning the final Winston Cup championship in 2003. As the reigning champion, he competed in the 2004 International Race of Champions season and claimed the series championship. Kenseth secured a rain-shortened victory at the Daytona 500 in 2009 and captured a second Daytona 500 title in 2012. As of 2022, he remains the last driver to compete in at least one NASCAR Cup Series race across four consecutive decades (1990s, 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s). He is also the father of Ross Kenseth.

==Early life and career==

Kenseth, born in Cambridge, Wisconsin, began stock car racing in 1988 at 16 years old at Madison International Speedway. Before that, he and his father, Roy, had an agreement: Roy would buy a car and race, while Matt worked on it until he was old enough to drive. “Neither of us knew much, and it was a learning experience,” Kenseth recalled. Kenseth&#x27;s first car, a 1981 Camaro previously driven to championships by Todd Kropf, proved successful. He won a feature race in just his third outing, holding off two top drivers, Pete Moore and Dave Phillips. “Matt was smooth. I knew then he was going to be a racer,” Roy said. In 1989, Kenseth competed for the points title at Wisconsin Dells, finishing second with eight feature wins. He also raced at Golden Sands Speedway and Columbus 151 Speedway. In 1990, he bought a late model car from Rich Bickle and won the season opener at Slinger Super Speedway, earning Rookie of the Year honors and finishing sixth in points. That year, he entered 15 ARTGO events and competed in 40 features.

After graduating from Cambridge High School, Kenseth worked at Left-hander Chassis, a racecar manufacturer, while continuing to race. In 1991, he became the youngest winner in ARTGO history, taking the checkered flag at La Crosse Fairgrounds Speedway after passing notable drivers like Joe Shear and Steve Holzhausen. The 1992 season was challenging, with Kenseth managing only three wins and numerous engine failures. Frustrated, he considered quitting but decided to continue after Kipley Performance loaned him a motor for the season finale, improving his performance. In 1993, Kenseth built a new car with a Kipley engine and won eight features at Madison, finishing second in points. Later that year, Mike Butz offered him a chance to race his late model. After early struggles, Kenseth and Butz&#x27;s team found success, winning the final short-track races at Madison, La Crosse, and I-70 Speedway. Kenseth also finished third in points at Wisconsin International Raceway.

The 1994 and 1995 seasons solidified Kenseth as a rising short-track star. Racing across Wisconsin, he earned victories over nationally known drivers like Dick Trickle and Robbie Reiser. In 1994, Kenseth competed in 60 events, winning track championships at Wisconsin International Raceway (WIR) on Thursdays and Madison International Speedway on Fridays, where he claimed 12 of 17 feature wins. He also captured the prestigious Slinger Nationals title. In 1995, Kenseth repeated as WIR champion, finished second at Madison, and won the Red, White, and Blue state championship series at WIR. Reflecting on his success, team owner Patty Butz remarked, &quot;We knew by 1995 that Matt had too much talent to be with us for very long.&quot;

In 1996, Kenseth moved to the Southern United States to race in the Hooters Late Model Series for engine builder Carl Wegner. The plan included running the Hooters Series, five NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series races, and five Busch Series events before transitioning to the Busch Series full-time in 1997. Kenseth finished third in the Hooters Series standings, nearly winning the championship as a rookie. He made his Busch Series debut that year at Lowe&#x27;s Motor Speedway, starting 30th and finishing 22nd in a car rented from Bobby Dotter. However, the team struggled to secure major sponsorship, which left Kenseth frustrated. &quot;It was just like 1992,” he said. &quot;Plans just didn&#x27;t work. I thought things would be different. Personally, I had moved and was adjusting to being a thousand miles from home.&quot; By the end of the season, the Wegner/Kenseth partnership dissolved. Kenseth then joined Gerry Gunderman&#x27;s American Speed Association team, which had previously housed Alan Kulwicki&#x27;s shop before his move to NASCAR. They raced together in two events in 1997 before Kenseth received a pivotal phone call from a former competitor.

==NASCAR career==

=== 1997 ===

In 1997, driver Tim Bender was injured, prompting crew chief and car owner Robbie Reiser to hire Kenseth, despite Kenseth having only one prior Busch Series start. Reiser explained, &quot;Matt and I used to have some fierce races against each other. I needed someone who understood race cars the way I understood them. I knew he could drive and he could talk to me in a manner I could understand.&quot; In their first race together, Kenseth qualified third but spun late while running third, finishing 11th. At Talladega, his second race on a drafting track, Kenseth started 20th and climbed to finish seventh. He secured two Top-5 finishes during the partial season.

=== 1998–1999 ===

Kenseth made his first attempt at a Winston Cup Series race at Talladega in May 1998. Driving the No. 60 Ford for Roush Racing, the entry was part of an effort by Jack Roush to evaluate Kenseth and the Reiser team. However, as it was Roush&#x27;s sixth entry in the race, the car lacked a competitive engine and failed to qualify for the field.

Kenseth made his next attempt at the Cup Series in 1998 at Dover, filling in for Bill Elliott in the No. 94 Ford for Elliott-Marino Racing. Elliott was absent to attend his father’s funeral. Kenseth impressed by finishing sixth, marking the third-best debut for any driver. The last driver to debut with a top-ten finish before Kenseth was Rusty Wallace, who placed second at Atlanta in 1980. Kenseth also ran full-time, winning his first Busch Series race on February 22, 1998, by nudging leader Tony Stewart in the final turn. He finished second in points that season, driving the No. 17 Chevy.

In 1999, Kenseth and the No. 17 Reiser Racing team were hired by Roush Racing for several Cup Series races.

=== 2000–02 ===
In 2000, Roush Racing fielded the No. 17 team full-time in the Cup Series, with sponsorship from DeWalt. Kenseth edged out Dale Earnhardt Jr. to claim the Raybestos Rookie of the Year title. Kenseth made history as the only rookie to win the prestigious Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte. He finished the season 14th in the standings, recording four Top-5 finishes, 11 Top-10s, and an average finish of 18.9.

In 2001, Kenseth finished 13th in the standings, with four Top-5 finishes and nine Top-10s. That year, his crew chief Robbie Reiser and the pit crew won the Unocal 76 World Pit Crew Competition. In 2002, Kenseth led the series in wins with five victories and earned one pole position. However, inconsistency relegated him to an 8th-place finish in the final standings. His victories came at Rockingham, Texas, Michigan, Richmond, and Phoenix. Kenseth&#x27;s pit crew also claimed their second Pit Crew Challenge title that season.

=== 2003 ===

In 2003, Kenseth started the season with a 20th-place finish in the Daytona 500 but quickly found his groove. Following his lone win of the season at Las Vegas, he claimed the points lead with a fourth-place finish at Atlanta in the season&#x27;s fourth race. Kenseth held the top spot for an impressive 33 consecutive weeks, breaking the modern-era record of 30 weeks set by Dale Earnhardt in his 1980 championship season.

At Charlotte, Kenseth secured his second pole of the year. Throughout the race, he battled handling issues with a car that was alternately loose and tight. During a late caution, Kenseth took a gamble by staying out on the track along with a few other drivers. The strategy paid off, as he finished in fourth place.

Kenseth clinched the 2003 NASCAR Winston Cup title on November 9 with a fourth-place finish at Rockingham in the penultimate race, finishing 90 points ahead of runner-up Jimmie Johnson. Kenseth dominated the standings, leading for the final 33 of 36 races, and recorded a series-best 25 top-10 finishes. He spent 35 of 36 weeks in the top 10, the only exception coming after a 20th-place finish in the Daytona 500. Kenseth’s championship season included one win and 11 top-5 finishes, making him the fifth different champion in five years and the third consecutive former Raybestos Rookie of the Year to win the title.

=== 2004–05 ===

In 2004, Kenseth won the International Race of Champions (IROC) championship. He qualified for the inaugural Nextel Cup Chase, starting the 10-race playoff in fifth place and finishing eighth in the final NASCAR point standings. Kenseth secured two wins that season, both coming early in the year at Rockingham and Las Vegas. His victory in the Subway 400 at Rockingham was a thrilling photo finish against eventual Raybestos Rookie of the Year Kasey Kahne. Additionally, he won the NASCAR All-Star Race. Kenseth was one of only four drivers to rank in the Top 10 throughout the entire season.

Kenseth began the 2005 season with a string of poor finishes but rebounded with a strong mid-season performance. After sitting 24th in the championship standings through 14 races, he climbed to 8th by race 26, securing a spot in the Chase for the Cup. Kenseth finished the season 7th in the final standings, highlighted by a win at Bristol. The season also marked his 200th career start. Through those first 200 starts, Kenseth had amassed one championship, 10 wins, 40 Top 5 finishes, 85 Top 10 finishes, one pole position, and over 28.5 million in earnings. He also led a career-high 1,001 laps during the season.

=== 2006–10 ===

Kenseth began the 2006 season by showing promise early in the Daytona 500, leading laps before spinning out after contact with Tony Stewart. Despite falling two laps down, he rallied to finish 15th. He bounced back with a victory in the second race at California Speedway and took the points lead after the eighth race at Phoenix. In the spring race at Dover, Kenseth claimed his second win of the season, charging from sixth place with 60 laps remaining to overtake Jamie McMurray for the lead on lap 397. Later in the season, he secured a spot in the Chase for the Nextel Cup with a win at the Sharpie 500 at Bristol Motor Speedway. Kenseth finished the year as the runner-up in the Driver&#x27;s Championship, earning $9,524,966 (about $ today) in winnings. He spent 27 of the 36 race weeks ranked first or second in points and led 1,132 laps, the second-most of any driver that season.

Kenseth also closed out the 2006 Busch Series season with back-to-back wins, driving the No. 17 Ford Fusion to victory at Phoenix and Homestead.

In the second race of the 2007 season, Kenseth won the Auto Club 500 at California Speedway. Following Jeff Gordon&#x27;s wreck in the Coca-Cola 600, Kenseth became the only driver to have completed every lap of the season. However, that streak ended when he was involved in a wreck during the Citizens Bank 400 at Michigan, caused by Ryan Newman attempting to regain one of his three lost laps. The incident also snapped Kenseth&#x27;s run of 13 consecutive top-15 finishes that season. At Watkins Glen, while Kenseth was running seventh during a red flag period, a shirtless fan approached his car and asked him to autograph a white baseball cap. Kenseth politely declined, and security escorted the fan out of the track. Kenseth later admitted he regretted not signing the cap. Kenseth won the Ford 400 at Homestead–Miami Speedway on November 18, 2007. This race marked the final event under the series title sponsor Nextel and the last to use templates based on the 1964 Holman-Moody Ford Fairlane design. Kenseth finished fourth in the series standings, extending his streak of Top 10 finishes to six consecutive seasons, tied with Jimmie Johnson for the most during that span. His efforts earned him $6,485,630 in winnings, along with an additional $100,000 from his sponsor, Safeway.

In the Busch Series, Matt Kenseth planned to compete in 23 races. He claimed victories at the Stater Brothers 300 at California Speedway in February and the O&#x27;Reilly 300 at Texas Motor Speedway in April.

In 2008, Kenseth endured a winless season and dropped to 11th in the points standings. His best performance came with a second-place finish in the fall race at Dover. Kenseth faced early challenges at the Daytona 500, starting near the back of the field. After working his way to the lead and leading two laps, he was knocked out of contention when his teammate, David Ragan, squeezed him into the wall. He finished 36th. Later in the season at the Goody&#x27;s Cool Orange 500, Kenseth started 28th but finished 31st. He was penalized a lap for pitting outside his box early in the race and later spun out by David Gilliland. Kenseth retaliated by wrecking Gilliland and was penalized two laps for the incident. Despite recording five Top 10 finishes during the Chase, his streak of six consecutive seasons with at least one win and a Top 10 points finish came to an end.

In the Nationwide Series Kenseth ended an 18-race winless streak by winning the Nicorette 300 at Atlanta Motor Speedway.

In 2009, Kenseth claimed victory in the rain-shortened Daytona 500, passing Elliott Sadler just moments before a caution was triggered on lap 146 due to a crash involving Aric Almirola and Sam Hornish Jr. Shortly after, the race was red-flagged and officially called at 152 laps, securing Kenseth his first Daytona 500 win. This marked a milestone for car owner Jack Roush, as it was his first Daytona 500 victory after 20 years in the sport. Kenseth, who started at the rear of the field, led only one green-flag lap (of his seven laps led) during the race, which was his tenth attempt at &quot;The Great American Race.&quot; Kenseth won the second race of the season, the Auto Club 500, becoming the fourth driver in NASCAR history to follow a Daytona 500 victory with a win in the next race. However, his attempt at a third consecutive win ended with engine failure at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, where he finished 43rd. Additionally, he won the pole at Darlington in the Sprint Cup Series, setting a new track record in the process. After finishing 25th at the Chevy Rock &amp; Roll 400 at Richmond, Kenseth was bumped out of the Chase by Brian Vickers. As a result, Kenseth finished 14th in points.

In the Nationwide Series, during the Aaron&#x27;s 312 on April 25, Matt Kenseth was involved in a dramatic crash. On lap 104, his car flipped 3.5 times, slid on its roof, and completed a fourth flip. The car burst into flames, but Kenseth miraculously walked away unharmed.

In 2010, after the Daytona 500, Drew Blickensderfer was released as crew chief of the No. 17 team, with Todd Parrott named as his replacement. Later in the season, Parrott was replaced by Jimmy Fennig. Despite not winning a race, Kenseth made the Chase for the Sprint Cup based on his consistency, ultimately finishing fifth in the final standings. In Nationwide Series, he won the Diamond Hill Plywood 200 at Darlington Raceway by leading only the final four laps, three under caution, after Kyle Busch suffered a flat tire just before a Green–white–checkered finish.

=== 2011 ===

During the third race of the 2011 season, Kenseth secured the fifth pole of his career by setting a new track record at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. A few races later, he ended a 76-race winless streak by winning at Texas Motor Speedway on April 9, 2011. Kenseth also claimed victory at the FedEx 400 at Dover International Speedway. A late caution prompted Kenseth and crew chief Jimmy Fennig to gamble with a two-tire pit stop instead of four, a strategy that proved decisive as Kenseth secured his second win in five races. Later in the season, Kenseth earned his third win at the Bank of America 500 at Charlotte Motor Speedway after qualifying for the Chase for the Sprint Cup. However, his hopes for a second championship were derailed by multiple on-track incidents with Brian Vickers.

In the Nationwide Series, on May 28, 2011, Kenseth won the Top Gear 300 at Charlotte while filling in for Trevor Bayne. Kenseth passed teammate Carl Edwards with two laps remaining to secure victory in his only Nationwide Series start that season.

=== 2012: Final Season At Roush ===

Kenseth’s 2012 season began with a victory at the Daytona 500, marking his second win at the prestigious race. On June 26, 2012, it was announced that Kenseth would leave Roush Fenway Racing at the end of the season. While speculation swirled about his plans for 2013, Kenseth remained tight-lipped, responding simply, &quot;No,&quot; when asked by reporters for a hint about his future team.On August 25, during the Irwin Tools Night Race at Bristol, Kenseth collided with Tony Stewart while battling for the lead on lap 332. Neither driver yielded entering Turn 1, resulting in a crash. Frustrated, Stewart threw his helmet at Kenseth&#x27;s car as it exited pit road. Both drivers had previously overcome being a lap down but were ultimately taken out of contention for the win.

On September 4, 2012, Joe Gibbs Racing officially announced that Kenseth would join the team for the 2013 season. Kenseth would drive the No. 20 Toyota, replacing Joey Logano.

On October 7, 2012, Kenseth claimed his second win of the year by taking victory in the Talladega fall race. He led 33 laps, the second-most of the race, and secured the win as a multi-car crash unfolded behind him.

On October 21, 2012, Kenseth secured his third win of the season and second during the 2012 Chase, triumphing at the freshly repaved Kansas Speedway. The new pavement made the track slick, leading to a record 14 cautions over 66 laps during the Hollywood Casino 400. This marked Kenseth&#x27;s first victory at Kansas, his 24th career win, and his final triumph with Roush Fenway Racing.

=== 2013: First Season At JGR ===

In the 2013 Daytona 500, Kenseth had a strong performance, leading a race-high 86 laps. However, his day ended prematurely on lap 149 due to engine failure, resulting in a 37th-place finish. Later that season, at Las Vegas, Kenseth secured his first victory in the No. 20 car, becoming only the third driver in NASCAR history—after Kyle Busch and Cale Yarborough—to win a race on their birthday. He held off Kasey Kahne to claim the victory.

At Kansas, Kenseth won the pole, led the most laps, and held off Kahne to secure the victory. However, post-race inspection revealed one of the engine&#x27;s eight connecting rods was three grams under the legal weight limit. As a result, Kenseth was penalized 50 points, his pole award and win were revoked, and the victory no longer counted toward Chase points. Crew chief Jason Ratcliff was fined 200,000 and suspended for one race. Car owner Joe Gibbs was docked six races&#x27; worth of owner points, and Toyota lost manufacturer points for five races. Gibbs appealed the penalties, and two weeks later, the appeals board ruled that the sanctions were overly harsh. Kenseth regained 38 of the 50 points, reducing his penalty to 12 points and moving him up to fourth in the standings. His pole award and win were reinstated, giving him two poles and two official wins. Gibbs&#x27; owner points penalty was reduced to one race, while Ratcliff&#x27;s suspension and the 200,000 fine remained unchanged. Toyota’s manufacturer points penalty was increased to seven races.

At the Southern 500 at Darlington, Kenseth passed teammate Kyle Busch with ten laps to go, securing his third victory of the season and his first-ever Sprint Cup Series win at the track. Later at Kentucky, Kenseth capitalized on Jimmie Johnson&#x27;s spin to take the lead and held off Jamie McMurray to claim his fourth win of the year. Following a few challenging weeks, Kenseth bounced back at Bristol, where he outdueled Kahne for the third time that season to earn his fifth victory.

With five regular-season wins, Kenseth was the top seed in the Chase. He started strong by holding off Kyle Busch to win the first two Chase races at Chicagoland and Loudon, marking his first victories at both tracks. The win at Loudon also made Kenseth just the second driver, alongside Richard Petty, to win in his 500th race start. Additionally, the victory moved him into 22nd place on the all-time wins list, surpassing Rex White.

Heading into the season finale at Homestead, only three drivers could win the Chase. Kenseth trailed Jimmie Johnson by 28 points and led Kevin Harvick by five. Kenseth started on the pole, with Harvick sixth and Johnson seventh. Kenseth dominated, leading a race-high 144 laps for the bonus point. His only setback came after a restart with 74 laps to go, when Jeff Gordon spun his tires, causing a chain reaction. Kenseth and Johnson made contact, dropping Kenseth to 12th and Johnson to 26th. Kenseth fought back to finish second behind teammate Denny Hamlin. He ended the season 19 points behind Johnson in the final standings. With seven wins, Kenseth secured more victories for the No. 20 car in a single season than it had ever achieved with Tony Stewart or Joey Logano behind the wheel. It was also a career best for Kenseth, surpassing his five wins in 2002.

In the Nationwide Series, Kenseth returned for 16 races, securing 7 top-five finishes, 14 top-ten finishes, and wins at Daytona in the summer and Kansas in the fall.

=== 2014 ===

In 2014, at Daytona, Kenseth won the first of two Budweiser Duels, holding off Kevin Harvick (whose race was later disqualified) and Kasey Kahne in a thrilling three-wide finish. This victory secured Kenseth a third-place starting position in the Daytona 500. Although he did not lead any laps during the race, Kenseth finished in sixth place.

With the new Chase format, Kenseth did not win any races but still advanced. His best finish was second at Atlanta, where Kahne passed him for the lead with fresh tires during the second Green-White-Checkered attempt. Kenseth led all winless drivers in points and, despite having no wins, managed to make it through the first two elimination rounds.

During the second round at Charlotte, a caution with 70 laps remaining set up a restart where Brad Keselowski restarted second and Kenseth restarted fourth. Kenseth attempted a three-wide pass on the outside of Keselowski, but Keselowski moved up the track, causing contact between Kenseth’s car and Keselowski&#x27;s right-rear bumper. This resulted in Kenseth hitting the wall. He dropped to 18th and fell a lap down due to the damage but regained the lap as the lucky dog after another caution. While under caution, Kenseth, frustrated with the earlier contact, slammed into Keselowski’s right-front, causing damage to Keselowski&#x27;s car. On a restart with two laps remaining, Keselowski pushed Kenseth’s teammate, Denny Hamlin, to get him going. Kenseth finished 19th, while Keselowski came in 16th. After the race, Hamlin brake-checked Keselowski, leading to minor contact. Keselowski drove around Hamlin and pursued Kenseth, who was entering pit road. Kenseth slightly turned, causing Keselowski to miss a major hit, but Keselowski did bump Kenseth’s door. In the process, Keselowski unintentionally bumped Tony Stewart’s car. Stewart responded by putting his car in reverse and ramming Keselowski’s car hard. Once out of their cars, tensions escalated. Hamlin attempted to confront Keselowski but was held back. Meanwhile, as Keselowski walked between two haulers, Kenseth charged in and physically attacked him. Keselowski’s crew chief, Paul Wolfe, restrained Kenseth, but Kenseth’s crew intervened, pulling Wolfe away to restrain both men. Kenseth&#x27;s mechanic, Jesse Sanders, and crew chief, Jason Ratcliff, were later summoned to the NASCAR hauler. No punches were thrown, so Kenseth and Hamlin were not penalized. However, NASCAR fined Keselowski and Stewart and placed them on probation for their actions on pit road.

The following week at Talladega, Kenseth matched his season-best finish with a 2nd place result, advancing to the Eliminator Round, while his rival Keselowski won the race. In the Eliminator Round, the field was narrowed to eight drivers.

At Martinsville, Kenseth entered a turn at high speed, causing his car to wheel-hop and collide with Kevin Harvick, who was still in contention for the Chase. The impact sent Harvick into the wall, dropping him 42 laps behind. After the initial contact, a sideways Kenseth was bumped by Tony Stewart, which straightened out Kenseth’s car without further damage. Later in the race, Harvick, having returned to the track, attempted to retaliate. He slowed down deliberately as Kenseth approached, trying to damage Kenseth’s radiator. However, Kenseth anticipated the move and slowed enough to avoid significant damage. Despite the drama, Kenseth managed to finish sixth, holding onto fourth place in the Chase standings. Harvick, meanwhile, finished 33rd. Frustrated, Harvick reportedly vowed that if this race cost him a shot at advancing in the Chase, he would ensure Kenseth didn’t make it either.

At Texas, Kenseth secured his second pole of the season but finished 25th in the race. At Phoenix, he started fifth, led no laps, and finished third, narrowly missing a spot in the Championship 4 by just three points. In the season finale at Homestead, Kenseth again led no laps and finished sixth, ending the season seventh in the standings.

That same weekend, Kenseth salvaged his season with a victory in the Ford EcoBoost 300, his final Nationwide Series win. Also in 2014, while driving the No. 20 car in 19 races, he earned 10 top-five finishes and 15 top-ten finishes.

=== 2015 ===

Kenseth began the 2015 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series season with a win at the Sprint Unlimited, marking the first victory for the newly redesigned Toyota Camry. Starting 16th, Kenseth led 21 laps and held off Martin Truex Jr. for the victory. However, his Daytona 500 campaign ended early with a crash on lap 41, leaving him with a 35th-place finish. Kenseth&#x27;s season saw a mix of highs and lows in the following weeks. He broke a 51-race winless streak by claiming the pole position and winning the Food City 500. Later in the season, he secured his second pole at the Coca-Cola 600. Despite a late-race caution, Kenseth stayed out rather than pitting, which resulted in a strong fourth-place finish. At the Toyota/Save Mart 350, he qualified third, marking his best-ever starting position on a road course.

At Pocono, Kenseth started seventh and claimed victory on the final lap after several drivers ran out of fuel, earning his first win at the track and second of the season. At Watkins Glen, he qualified 26th and finished fourth, marking his first top-five finish at the road course. Kenseth secured his third pole position of the year in the Pure Michigan 400 and went on to win his third race of the season. This victory elevated him to 20th on the all-time wins list with 34 career wins, surpassing Dale Jarrett, Fireball Roberts, and Kyle Busch. In the final race of the regular season, Kenseth started second, dominated by leading 352 of 400 laps, and earned his fourth win of the season. This tied him with Busch and Jimmie Johnson for the most wins heading into the Chase for the Sprint Cup.

In the first race of the Chase at Chicago, Kenseth started 12th, led one lap, and finished fifth. At New Hampshire, he capitalized on Kevin Harvick running out of fuel with three laps remaining, taking the lead and securing his fifth win of the year to advance to the second round of the Chase. In Dover, rain awarded Kenseth the pole as the points leader. He led 25 laps and finished seventh, maintaining his points lead. At Talladega, Kenseth started in the second row but crashed on the final green-white-checkered finish, finishing 26th and being eliminated in the Contender Round.

=== Feud with Joey Logano and Return to Homestead after suspension ===
During the Hollywood Casino 400, Kenseth led the most laps but was spun out by Joey Logano with five laps remaining, costing him a spot in the Eliminator Round.

At Martinsville, Kenseth spent much of the race running in the Top 10 before being involved in a crash. Brad Keselowski hit Kenseth after breaking a tie rod, causing significant damage to Kenseth&#x27;s car and forcing him to lose nine laps for repairs. Upon returning to the track, Kenseth intentionally wrecked race leader Logano in retaliation for being spun out of the lead by Logano two weeks earlier at Kansas. The crowd erupted in cheers and applause following Kenseth’s actions, but NASCAR immediately disqualified him. After the race, Kenseth was summoned to the NASCAR hauler and later suspended for two races, along with a probation period initially set at six months. Team owner Joe Gibbs appealed the penalty, arguing it was unprecedented and unfair. While the probation period was reduced to end on December 31, the two-race suspension was upheld by both the appeals panel and Final Appeals Officer Bryan Moss.

During his suspension, Kenseth was replaced by young talent Erik Jones, who delivered impressive finishes for a rookie, placing 12th and 19th.

After his suspension, NASCAR President Brian France met with Kenseth and Logano to address lingering tensions. Initially, Kenseth claimed a tire failure caused him to crash into Logano. However, after serving his suspension, he admitted the move was deliberate and expressed no remorse. Kenseth&#x27;s actions effectively ended Logano&#x27;s chances of advancing to the final round of the Chase. Fans cheered for Kenseth as Logano struggled, including a 40th-place finish at Texas after cutting a tire and spinning out, and a third-place finish at the rain-shortened Quicken Loans Race for Heroes 500 in Phoenix, eliminating him from championship contention.

At Homestead–Miami Speedway, Kenseth started in 19th place and finished 7th, marking his 20th top-10 finish of the season. He ultimately ended the season 15th in the standings.

=== 2016 ===
Kenseth began the season with a strong showing in the Daytona 500, leading 40 laps in the final stages. He took the white flag but was passed by teammates Denny Hamlin and Martin Truex Jr. A failed blocking attempt sent Kenseth sideways, causing him to lose several positions. He finished 14th, while Hamlin won in a historic finish. In Atlanta, Kenseth was penalized for &quot;improper fueling&quot; during a green flag pit stop and had to serve a pass-through penalty. He was also black-flagged for not pitting within three laps. After serving the penalty, he finished 31st, two laps down, and later explained he hadn&#x27;t seen or heard the penalty flag. Despite this, he finished 19th. At Las Vegas, Kenseth was involved in a multi-car wreck with Chase Elliott, Kurt Busch, and Carl Edwards, ultimately finishing 37th.

At Talladega, Kenseth started 4th and led 39 of the first 71 laps before being involved in a late-race wreck with Joey Logano, causing Kenseth to barrel-roll onto his roof. After the race, Kenseth exchanged words with Logano, accusing him of forcing him off the track just before the crash. In a post-race interview, Kenseth warned Logano, saying, &quot;You&#x27;re going to race me right before I&#x27;m finished racing.&quot; However, the following week, both drivers resolved their differences with a phone call.

At the restart following a caution at Dover, Kenseth lined up on the inside front row next to Jimmie Johnson. Johnson appeared to get a great start but struggled to shift into 4th gear, triggering an 18-car wreck. Kenseth managed to avoid the chaos, and a red flag was waved. With 10 laps remaining, Kenseth found it difficult to hold off Kyle Larson. However, when third-place driver Chase Elliott challenged Larson, Kenseth had no trouble securing the victory, ending a 17-race winless streak.

At the first New Hampshire race of the season, Kenseth secured his second win of the year and his 38th career victory, holding off Tony Stewart. This win marked Kenseth&#x27;s second consecutive victory at New Hampshire. The triumph also moved him into 19th place on the all-time wins list, surpassing Bobby Isaac and teammate Kyle Busch. However, after the race, Joe Gibbs Racing was penalized 15 owner and driver points for failing the post-race inspection at New Hampshire. The car did not pass the Laser Inspection Station (LIS), leading NASCAR to impose a P3 penalty, which dropped Kenseth from eighth to ninth in the standings. Crew chief Jason Ratcliff was also fined 25,000.

In the Chase race at Phoenix, Kenseth was leading late, but a late-race restart saw him wreck with Alex Bowman, ending his championship hopes. Kenseth finished 5th in the points standings.

=== 2017: Final Season At JGR ===

Kenseth lost his Dollar General sponsor before the season, prompting Dewalt to increase its sponsorship to 15 races. Tide came on for three races, starting with the Phoenix race, and added a fourth at Martinsville. Peak and BlueDef sponsored Las Vegas and Auto Club. Circle K joined mid-season, backing six races, beginning at Richmond, where Kenseth earned his first pole and stage win. They added an extra race due to a sponsorship gap. Despite these deals, the team relied on Toyotacare as a fill-in sponsor at Texas and Dover. After a slow start, Kenseth rebounded, contending for a playoff spot with Clint Bowyer and Joey Logano. He finished second at Watkins Glen, his best road-course result, and earned the pole at the regular-season finale in Richmond. Kenseth made the playoffs for the 13th time despite a 38th-place finish, leading much of Stage 1 before a brake lock-up caused a caution. He avoided further issues and secured the final playoff spot, edging Bowyer, Erik Jones, and Logano.

On July 11, 2017, Joe Gibbs Racing announced that Erik Jones would replace Kenseth in the No. 20 car for the 2018 season, leaving Kenseth without a ride. On November 4, 2017, Kenseth revealed that he would take time off from the sport. With two races remaining in the 2017 season, Kenseth had yet to secure a victory and was eliminated from the playoffs after a disqualification. His pit crew had an eighth member step over the wall to help repair his car after a wreck, resulting in the penalty. Despite receiving offers from lesser-known team owners to drive in 2018, Kenseth chose to turn them down.

At Phoenix, Kenseth passed Chase Elliott with 9 laps remaining to win his first race of the year, ending a 51-race winless streak.“Yeah, it’s really not describable,” Kenseth said. “With only two (races) left, I didn’t think we probably had a good chance of getting back to Victory Lane. It’s been, I don’t know how many races – somebody’s probably going to tell me tonight – but it”s been at least 50 or 60, so it’s been a long time. We’ve had a lot of close ones. Just felt like it was never meant to be, and today it was meant to be…. I’ve got to be honest with you, I never dreamed I’d win one of these races, so obviously I’ve been so incredibly blessed throughout my whole career.” This win marked his 39th, tying him with Tim Flock for 19th place on the all-time wins list.

DeWalt sponsored Kenseth for his final race with JGR at Homestead–Miami, with his car featuring a paint scheme reminiscent of his rookie design from 2000. Kenseth finished in 8th place in the race and ultimately secured 7th in the official points standings.

=== 2018 ===

In April 2018, Roush Fenway Racing announced that Kenseth would return to the team to drive the No. 6 Ford on a part-time basis, sharing the car with full-time driver Trevor Bayne. Kenseth&#x27;s schedule, which included seven races starting with the KC Masterpiece 400 at Kansas, was supported by Wyndham Rewards as a sponsor.

For the Kansas race, his first since November 2017, Kenseth started from the rear after failing to set a qualifying time due to not passing inspection. He finished 36th after being involved in a crash on lap 254.

Due to his 2003 Championship, as well as victories in the 2004 event and the fall 2017 Phoenix race, Kenseth was eligible for the All-Star Race. He started from the pole and finished 14th. After a series of mediocre results, Kenseth found his form late in the summer. He won the second stage of the Brickyard 400 and finished 12th. Kenseth earned his first top-10 of the season at the Phoenix fall race with a seventh-place finish. In his final race for RFR at Homestead, he finished 6th.

=== 2019 ===

Kenseth returned to racing in July 2019, making his first start since Homestead–Miami in a Super Late Model at the Slinger Nationals. He extended his race-record win total to eight by passing former Roush teammate Ty Majeski on the final lap. Later that year, Kenseth served as the grand marshal for the CTECH Manufacturing 180 at Road America. He also appeared on &quot;Coffee with Kyle&quot;, a series on NBC Sports hosted by Kyle Petty.

=== 2020 ===
On April 27, 2020, Kenseth was announced as the replacement for Kyle Larson in the No. 42 Chevrolet for Chip Ganassi Racing for the remainder of the season, after Larson was released for using a racial slur during an iRacing event two weeks earlier. NASCAR granted Kenseth a waiver for eligibility in the 2020 playoffs. In his return to racing, Kenseth finished 10th at Darlington on May 17, 2020, marking his 330th career top-ten finish. He later secured a season-best second-place finish on July 5, 2020, at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, which turned out to be his only top-five and final top-ten result of the season. On September 21, 2020, Chip Ganassi Racing announced that Ross Chastain would replace Kenseth in 2021. Kenseth concluded the season with a 25th-place finish at the Phoenix finale, the site of his final career victory, and finished 28th in the overall standings.

In a November 18, 2020, interview with the &quot;Wisconsin State Journal&quot;, Kenseth stated that he was &quot;almost 100 percent certain&quot; he would not return to full-time NASCAR racing, choosing instead to focus on late models and sports cars.

=== 2023 ===
On May 4, 2022, it was announced that Kenseth, along with Hershel McGriff and Kirk Shelmerdine, would be part of the NASCAR Hall of Fame Class of 2023. On August 2, 2023, the Southeastern Wisconsin Short Track Racing Hall of Fame announced Kenseth&#x27;s induction into their 2024 class, after a scheduling conflict prevented him from joining the Class of 2023. On October 10, 2023, it was announced that Kenseth would join Legacy Motor Club as the team&#x27;s competition advisor.

==Championship controversy==
After the 2003 season, Kenseth&#x27;s championship sparked controversy and criticism of the Winston Cup points system. Critics, including Roger Penske, questioned how a driver could win the season championship with only one victory in 36 races. Kenseth led the points standings for 33 weeks despite his lone win and had already clinched the title with one race remaining, making the final event essentially meaningless. This led to discussions about revising the system to prevent similar scenarios. By comparison, in 2000, Bobby Labonte also clinched the championship one race early under the same system, but he had four wins and led the standings for 31 of 34 races. Kenseth&#x27;s 2003 season included 11 top-five finishes and 25 top-ten finishes.

In 2004, NASCAR introduced a new points and playoff system called &quot;The Chase for the Nextel Cup,&quot; following Nextel Communications replacing Winston as the primary sponsor of its top series. The system established a 10-race playoff, limiting championship contention to the top 10 drivers in points after the first 26 races and placing greater emphasis—and a points premium—on race wins. This change became informally known as &quot;The Matt Kenseth Rule,&quot; referencing Kenseth&#x27;s 2003 championship season, during which he won only one race but secured the title through consistent finishes. Although NASCAR denied that Kenseth&#x27;s championship directly influenced the creation of The Chase, officials acknowledged that the 2003 outcome brought attention to the issue. NASCAR stated it had been exploring ways to reward race wins more heavily since 2000. Nevertheless, the timing of the format&#x27;s debut in 2004 and Kenseth&#x27;s 2003 title created a perceived connection, which NASCAR officials referenced in interviews and press releases when announcing the new system.

==Personal life==

Matt Kenseth is the son of Roy and Nicola Sue Kenseth. In 2000, he married Katie Martin, who is also from Cambridge. Together, Matt and Katie have four daughters. Kenseth also has a son, Ross Kenseth, from a previous relationship. Following in his father’s footsteps, Ross began his racing career in legends cars and late models in Wisconsin before competing in ARCA and NASCAR. Kenseth is also a grandfather of two.

Kenseth competed in the 2022 Boston Marathon, finishing 3,576th overall and 141st in the Men&#x27;s 50-54 division with a time of 3:01:40.

Kenseth established a fan museum in Cambridge in 2004 following his championship season. The museum later relocated to a downtown storefront before closing in 2017.

Kenseth is a fan of the metal band Metallica and named his cat after drummer Lars Ulrich. Additionally, he supports the Green Bay Packers.

<text>Brithenig, or also known as Comroig, is an invented language, or constructed language (&quot;conlang&quot;). It was created as a hobby in 1996 by Andrew Smith from New Zealand, who also invented the alternate history of Ill Bethisad to &quot;explain&quot; it. Officially according to the Ill Bethisad Wiki, Brithenig is classified as a Britanno-Romance language, along with other Romance languages that displaced Celtic.

Brithenig was not developed to be used in the real world, like Volapük, Esperanto, Interlingua or Interslavic, or to provide detail to a work of fiction, like Klingon from the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. Rather, Brithenig started as a thought experiment to create a Romance language that might have evolved if Latin had displaced the native Celtic language as the spoken language of the people in Great Britain.

The result is an artificial sister language to French, Catalan, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanian, Occitan and Italian which differs from them by having sound-changes similar to those that affected Welsh, and words that are borrowed from the Brittonic languages and from English throughout its pseudo-history. One important distinction between Brithenig and Welsh is that Welsh is P-Celtic, but Latin was a Q-Italic language (as opposed to P-Italic, like Oscan), and the trait was passed onto Brithenig.

Similar efforts to extrapolate Romance languages are (influenced by the other branch of Celtic), (influenced by Hebrew), (a non-Ill Bethisad language influenced by Icelandic), &quot;Venedic&quot; (influenced by Polish), and &quot;Xliponian&quot; (which experienced a Grimm&#x27;s law-like sound shift). It has also inspired &quot;Wessisc&quot;, a hypothetical Germanic language influenced by contact with Old Celtic.

Brithenig was granted the code BZT as part of ISO 639-3.

Andrew Smith was one of the conlangers featured in the exhibit &quot;Esperanto, Elvish, and Beyond: The World of Constructed Languages&quot; displayed at the Cleveland Public Library from May through August 2008. Smith&#x27;s creation of Brithenig was cited as the reason for his inclusion in the exhibit (which also included the Babel Text in Smith&#x27;s language).

== Orthography ==

Brithenig orthography is similar to that of Welsh, except:
* Unlike Welsh, Brithenig has soft C and G; that is, before vowels &quot;e&quot; and &quot;i&quot; the consonants &quot;c&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are pronounced , , similar to Italian.
** Brithenig also use such phonemes finally in letters &quot;c&quot; and &quot;g&quot;.
** Hard G in Brithenig is indicated by &quot;gh&quot; as in Italian.
** Similarly, when preceding &quot;e&quot; and &quot;i&quot;, &quot;sc&quot; is pronounced , otherwise .
* The letter &quot;k&quot; used for hard is much more alive in Brithenig than Welsh.
* While Welsh words are usually stressed in penultimate syllables, Brithenig words are stressed in the last syllable (Brithenig &quot;yscol vs. Welsh ysgol&quot;, both mean &quot;school&quot;).
* It lacks complicated rules on predicting vowel length from orthography: stressed vowels are always pronounced long.
* Brithenig has numerous silent letters.
** In words more than two syllables, word-final &quot;-t&quot; in the sequence &quot;-nt&quot;, and &quot;-r&quot; or &quot;-l&quot; as the second members of consonant clusters become silent.
** Word-final &quot;-f&quot; generally silent, but not as an orthographically geminate &quot;-ff&quot;.
** In the infinitive endings &quot;-ar&quot;, &quot;-er&quot;, &quot;-ir&quot;, the &quot;-r&quot; is usually unpronounced.
* Some speakers pronounce &quot;-ae&quot; and &quot;-oe&quot; as and , respectively. In the standard variant, both vowels are pronounced as and .
* Monosyllabic words ending in consonant clusters which end in &quot;-r&quot; or &quot;-l&quot; are pronounced with an epenthetic vowel same as the last vowel (&quot;llifr&quot; pronounced as &quot;llifir&quot; , see above).

== Phonology ==


== Grammar ==
=== Mutation ===
Like Welsh and other Celtic languages, initial consonant mutations (&quot;cluinediwn&quot;, lit. &quot;declensions&quot;) in Brithenig is an important feature. Three mutations exist: soft (&quot;moillad&quot;), spirant (&quot;solwed&quot;), and nasal (&quot;naral&quot;).
Soft mutation are used with feminine nouns, adjectives, verbs, change in word order, after an adverb, and prepositions &quot;di&quot; &quot;of, from&quot; and &quot;gwo&quot; &quot;under&quot;. Spirant mutation are used for marking plurals on nouns, adjective, and verbs, but also after prepositions &quot;tra&quot; &quot;through&quot; and &quot;a&quot; &quot;to, at&quot;, and the conjunction &quot;mai&quot; &quot;but&quot;. Nasal mutation are used after the negative adverb used to negate verbs &quot;rhen&quot;, and prepositions &quot;in&quot; &quot;in&quot; and &quot;cun&quot; &quot;with&quot;.

Before a vowel, the prepositions &quot;a&quot; &quot;to, at&quot; and &quot;e&quot; &quot;and&quot; irregularly became &quot;a-dd&quot; and &quot;e-dd&quot;.

=== Nouns and adjectives ===
Gender in Brithenig nouns is lexical and unpredictable, as it obscured by historic sound changes. The indefinite article in Brithenig is &quot;yn&quot;x &quot;one&quot;.
Unlike Welsh with unpredictably-formed plurals, Brithenig has no dedicated separate plural suffix, thus, the singular and plural forms are almost always invariable (similar to transnumeral languages such as Indonesian and Korean). Instead, the plural definite article is generally placed before the noun (&quot;lla gas&quot;, &quot;llo chas&quot;), but yet some exceptions to this rule exist. Exceptions include the plural of &quot;(ill) of&quot; &quot;man&quot;, &quot;(llo) h-on&quot;; and some plurals that formed by placing feminine singular definite article before it with spirant lenition (&quot;ill bordd&quot;, &quot;lla fordd&quot;).

Dual forms of natural pairs (e.g. arms, legs), however, have their own prefix and formed by prefixing &quot;dew-&quot; &quot;two&quot; to the nouns. The similar feature also occurs in Breton. Diminutives and augmentatives are derived by suffixing &quot;-ith&quot; (usual)/&quot;-in&quot; (affection/collective) and &quot;-un&quot;, respectively.

=== Pronouns ===
The third person has no distinction of numbers, but can be indicated by spirant lenition on succeeding nominals or verbs (before singulars the mutation is not used). Unlike nouns, pronouns are not just inflected for numbers, but also grammatical cases. Like many languages, Brithenig has a T–V distinction, with &quot;ty&quot; being used for addressing people whom the speaker is familiar with or gods, while &quot;Gw&quot; is used when speaking to a stranger or a less familiar or more formal acquaintance (with capitals). Before feminine nouns, the succeeding noun(s) exhibit soft mutation, while before plural the noun(s) exhibit spirant mutation. When mutated, &quot;ty&quot; and &quot;ti&quot; irregularly become &quot;dy&quot;x to avoid confusion with &quot;di&quot; &quot;of&quot;. Unlike Welsh, Brithenig makes fewer use of inflected prepositions, and such prepositions only found in the word &quot;cun&quot; &quot;with&quot;:
=== Verbs ===
Similar to Spanish and Portuguese, Brithenig verbs are divided into 3 conjugations according to their infinitive endings: &quot;-ar&quot; (&quot;canhar &quot;to sing&quot;), &quot;-er&quot; (&quot;perdder &quot;to lose&quot;), and &quot;-ir&quot; (&quot;dorfir&quot; &quot;to sleep&quot;) (note that the final &quot;-r&quot; are usually silent). Brithenig is a non-null-subject language, that is, it requires pronouns before the verb forms (&quot;ys cant&quot; &quot;he sings&quot;). Note that the stem&#x27;s final consonants also undergo lenition, but also unvoiced final stop consonants become voiced in the imperfect, past definite, and subjunctive past plurals; future, and conditional forms (that in verbs like &quot;canhar&quot; those also undergo mutation as well).

Subjunctive forms nowadays only survive in fixed phrases, like &quot;can in Rhufein, ffâ si llo Rhufan ffeigant&quot; &quot;when in Rome, do as the Romans do&quot;. Also in subjunctive present forms, final vowels are affected by i-affection (except in &quot;-ar&quot; verbs where it only happen in plural forms):

==== Regular verbs ====


==== Irregular verbs ====
While the Brithenig conjugation is mostly regular, there are some irregular verbs. In past definite tense, some verbs have s-stem preterite originating from Latin perfect tenses in &quot;-x-&quot; or &quot;-s-&quot; (&quot;eo ddis&quot; from &quot;diger&quot; &quot;to say&quot; for example):
In past participles, instead of regular forms, some verbs have irregular participles inherited from Latin supines in &quot;-tum&quot; (&quot;facere, factum → &quot;fager, faeth&quot; &quot;to do&quot;), &quot;-sum&quot; (&quot;claudere, clausum → &quot;clodder, clos&quot; &quot;to close&quot;), or even combinations of them (&quot;vidēre, *vistum&quot; → &quot;gwidder, gwist&quot; &quot;to see&quot;). Some verbs also have irregular imperative forms, either by lengthening the last vowel and deleting last consonant (only in the case of familiar imperatives, &quot;diger&quot;, &quot;dî&quot;, &quot;digeth&quot;), or taking forms from subjunctive (&quot;saber&quot;, &quot;seib&quot;, &quot;seibeth&quot;). The verb &quot;gweddir&quot; &quot;to go&quot;, where it comes from Latin &quot;vadō&quot; but it is not suppleted with other verbs, has irregularities in the present tense: &quot;eo wa&quot;, &quot;tu wa&quot;, &quot;ys wa&quot;, &quot;sa wa&quot;, &quot;nu wan&quot;, &quot;gw wath&quot;, &quot;ys/sa want&quot;.

===== Most irregular verbs =====
&quot;Irregular forms are underlined.&quot;


===Syntax===
The default word order in Brithenig is subject–verb–object (SVO), overall syntax is similar to French but unlike Welsh. However, when the verb coexists with an object pronoun the word order changes to subject–object–verb. The word order for yes–no questions is verb–subject–object (&quot;gw pharolath Brithenig&quot; &quot;you speak Brithenig&quot; vs. &quot;parola&#x27;gw Frithenig?&quot; &quot;are you speaking Brithenig?&quot;).

== Vocabulary ==
Most of Brithenig&#x27;s vocabulary is distinctively Romance even though it is disguised as Welsh. This list of 30 words gives an impression of what Brithenig looks like in comparison to nine other Romance languages, including Wenedyk, and to Welsh. The similarity of about one quarter of the Welsh words to Brithenig words (indicated by not being bracketed) is because of their common Indo-European background, but a few others, such as &quot;ysgol&quot;, were borrowings from Latin into Welsh.

<doc id="425492" wikidata="Q166571" url="?curid=425492" title="British Movement">
<text>The British Movement (BM), later called the British National Socialist Movement (BNSM), is a British neo-Nazi organisation founded by Colin Jordan in 1968. It grew out of the National Socialist Movement (NSM), which was founded in 1962. Frequently on the margins of the British far-right, the BM has had a long and chequered history for its association with violence and extremism. It was founded as a political party but manifested itself more as a pressure and activist group. It has had spells of dormancy.

==Formation==
The NSM had come to an end sometime after Colin Jordan was imprisoned in early 1967 for distributing a racist leaflet &quot;The Coloured Invasion&quot; and following his release Jordan had met John Tyndall in Denis Pirie&#x27;s house about the possibility of joining the National Front. These talks came to nothing however and with the Race Relations Act 1968 passed the notion of openly parading Nazi credentials in a party name had to be abandoned, leading to Jordan forming a new group to known as the British Movement. Whilst the new party intended to continue the old group&#x27;s role of being Nazi apologists and endorsing anti-Semitism it aimed to do so within the restrictions brought in by the newly enacted law.

==Violence==

Not long after its formation the BM gained news coverage in Leicester, where a growing Midlands branch was being organised by Ray Hill, when local members attacked students who were supporting an Anti-Apartheid Movement protest against a South African trade delegation visiting the city. Direct action activities such as this, which usually ended in violence, became the stock in trade of the BM during its early days. An underground cell, the National Socialist Group, was also established in Blackheath by David Courtney and this undertook paramilitary training exercises in Scotland whilst also seeking to build links between the BM and like-minded groups in Europe. The group vanished suddenly in 1969 when Special Branch began to investigate them, with Courtney in particular dropping out of the far-right scene for some time afterwards.

Despite this setback violence remained on the agenda as the party maintained a &quot;Leader Guard&quot; of violent members whom it encouraged to join the Territorial Army, as well as a Women&#x27;s Division and a National Youth Movement. Members of the BM also took part in paramilitary training exercises in Germany. One of the BM&#x27;s fiercest street fighters, Nicky Crane, led and organised several violent attacks by the BM on non-whites. Following a BM meeting in May 1978, Nicky Crane and other BM members took part in an assault on a black family at a bus stop in Bishopsgate, east London using broken bottles. In 1979, Crane and BM members were part of 200-strong skinhead mob that attacked Asians on Brick Lane, east London. Crane also led and instigated the Woolwich Odeon attack of 1980. After their intended victims ran inside the Odeon cinema to escape attack, Crane and BM members started smashing windows and doors. One Pakistani man was knocked unconscious.

Convictions were not uncommon. Crane was jailed in 1981 for his part in an ambush on black youths at Woolwich Arsenal station. An Old Bailey judge described Crane as &quot;worse than an animal&quot; after his part in the May 1978 bus stop attack in Bishopsgate. Other BM members felt the force of the law as was the case in January 1981 when three members, Rod Roberts, Harvey Stock and Robert Giles, were arrested for possession of illegal weapons and attempted arson with Roberts imprisoned for seven years as a result.

==Political activity==
The BM entered electoral politics in 1969 when Jordan put himself forward as a candidate for the Birmingham Ladywood by-election. The campaign made no attempts to hide the party&#x27;s support for Nazism and violence became the hallmark, not least on the election night itself when scuffles at the count were televised nationally. The 3.5% vote share that the BM secured was treated as a success by activists who felt that it proved that even with a Nazi message nearly 300 people were still prepared to vote for an anti-immigration candidate. Indeed, the BM members had openly worn the German Nazi Swastika symbol, and party literature featured pictures of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler.

The BM contested the UK general elections in 1970 and in February 1974. The party failed to attract much support in those elections due to its openness about its support for Nazism, and because most of the far right vote went to the National Front (NF). The group&#x27;s highest result was the 2.5% share which Jordan captured in Birmingham Aston in 1970. Nonetheless, contact between the BM and NF was not infrequent and in early 1972 John Tyndall had met with Jordan and discussed the possibility that the BM might form the basis of a new NF group in the Midlands, an area of BM strength and NF weakness. The proposal was soon dropped however and was largely made only because Tyndall was seeking to build a power-base in his attempts to replace John O&#x27;Brien as NF chairman. For his part, Jordan had a long-held ambition to unite the divided far-right and he personally oversaw the production of a BM leaflet, &quot;Nationalist Solidarity in &#x27;70&quot;, in which he called for personal disagreements to be set aside in favour of presenting a united front. There were occasional examples of individuals holding simultaneous membership of the BM and NF, although they were not linked at any official level.

Jordan&#x27;s run as leader came to an end in 1975 when he was arrested in the Coventry branch of Tesco on a charge of shoplifting. Jordan declared that the event, and the reports that the item he had stolen were a pair of women&#x27;s knickers, was a frame-up, but soon after he resigned as leader of the BM to take on an advisory role.

==Post-Jordan==
After Jordan stood down as leader of the BM, Michael McLaughlin, a former milkman from Liverpool, became the leader. McLaughlin, who was seen as a talented organiser but weak leader, was largely believed to have been chosen as little more than a &quot;front&quot; leader who could be controlled by Jordan from behind the scenes. McLaughlin quickly rejected this notion and made it clear that Jordan&#x27;s time was over, resulting in the former leader retiring to Yorkshire from where he still published his own journal &quot;Gothic Ripples&quot; from time to time, the pages of which were regularly filled with criticism of McLaughlin.

McLaughlin, in contrast to Jordan, was under no delusions that the BM might gain a broad following and instead he felt that its best area of possible support was amongst young, working-class males. The BM journals, &quot;The Phoenix&quot; and &quot;British Patriot&quot;, thus changed to become much more simplistic and aggressive publications largely shorn of Jordan&#x27;s pseudoscientific racialism in favour of more basic notions. The BM had also gained some publicity in 1976 when &quot;race martyr&quot; and sometime party activist Robert Relf went on hunger strike in protest at the Race Relations Bill but this proved short-lived as Tyndall quickly signed Relf up to the NF. Relf had gained national attention after he advertised his house as being &quot;For Sale - to a white family only&quot;. Meanwhile, McLaughlin&#x27;s baser ideas struck a chord with the growing White power skinhead movement and large numbers of these youths, many of whom were involved in regular acts of violence against non-Whites, flocked to the BM. By 1980 it claimed to have 4,000 members and 25 branches.

The notion of recruiting violent youths to form a street army appealed to Martin Webster who attempted to coax members away from the BM to the NF but the BM only lost a handful of members in this manner before NF leader John Tyndall, mindful of the desire to present a respectable NF image, called a halt to the scheme. A key strategy for gaining publicity and members was by encouraging violence at football matches and concerts. Nicky Crane, one of the leading figures of the neo-Nazi skinhead movement, joined the BM and became an organiser in Kent. By this time the BM had effectively given up mainstream politics in favour of provocative marches and violence, changes that appealed to the younger element who were disillusioned with the disintegrating NF.

==Ray Hill&#x27;s return==
In 1980, Ray Hill, who had been a leading member of the BM under Jordan before emigrating to South Africa, rejoined the group and soon became one of its leading figures, a decision prompted by the anti-fascist magazine &quot;Searchlight&quot;, for whom Hill had become a mole. Hill was appointed Area Leader in the East Midlands where he was given responsibility for enticing disaffected NF members to join the BM. Before long Hill had added about thirty members in Leicester and had also built a close working relationship with the British Democratic Party in the city. Hill also managed to ensure publicity for the BM from the &quot;Leicester Mercury&quot; after a riot in the city, a fact that won him the admiration of McLaughlin.

Following an incident at a Birmingham hotel in which NF supporters had entered a room booked by the BM and daubed the walls with graffiti Hill suggested to McLaughlin that the breach in security had been the fault of Steve Brady, a leading figure in the League of St. George and the only non-BM member invited to the event. McLaughlin appointed Hill to head up an &quot;anti-subversion unit&quot; as a result, although a lack of funding ensured that the unit never actually convened. Nonetheless Hill continued to criticise Brady to McLaughlin and before long Hill had been promoted to the head of the entire Midlands region following the retirement of Birmingham chief Peter Marriner.

Under &quot;Searchlight&quot; direction Hill sought to take charge of the BM and he launched his campaign at a demonstration in Welling in October 1980 organised by Crane. Attending in McLaughlin&#x27;s stead after the BM leader had asked him to Hill made frequent references to other organisers present about allegations that McLaughlin was letting them do the work whilst he stayed behind at BM headquarters in Lampeter collecting membership fees. A speech criticising the police at a BM rally in Paddington helped to cement Hill&#x27;s popularity amongst the rank and file membership, most of whom held police in contempt.

After he opened contact with Jordan, Hill was expelled from the BM by McLaughlin in 1981. Hill was backed by his Leicester branch, London organiser Tony Malski and Robert Relf and his lieutenant Mike Cole, all of whom backed Hill to replace McLaughlin as leader. Hill released a statement to BM members rejecting the expulsion and threatening a court injunction to overturn the expulsion. With legal advice provided by British Democratic Party leader Anthony Reed Herbert, Hill soon issued the writ against McLaughlin, who attempted to get around the problems by renaming the BM the British Nationalist and Socialist Movement and claiming that the BM in fact no longer existed.

==Collapse==
About half of the members of the BM went with Hill out and joined the newly launched British National Party in 1982, a huge blow to McLaughlin&#x27;s group. The party failed to contest the 1983 general election, although a single candidate had attempted to stand in Peterborough as a Labour Party candidate; he was barred by the returning officer after several signatures on the nominating papers were found to be invalid. McLaughlin finally announced the closure of the BM in September 1983 and in the statement blamed the court case brought by Ray Hill which had severely depleted BM funds.

==New group==
A group calling itself the British Movement continued to operate after September 1983 under the leadership of Stephen Frost, a Yorkshire member of the original BM. At its 1985 yearly meeting the BM established a new group to be known as the British National Socialist Movement (BNSM). Whilst the BM continued to exist alongside the BNSM the latter gave more freedom to activists by operating as a cell-based structure within the BM. The new group attempted to act as a rallying-point for white power skinheads, although this role was later filled more successfully by Blood and Honour. It also continued to have involvement in football hooliganism and BM members were amongst the rioters responsible for the Heysel Stadium disaster at the 1985 European Cup final.

The BNSM was soon attempting to re-activate the old BM membership and followed the old template of encouraging members to undergo military training through the Territorial Army or other means. The BNSM built up links with the Ulster Defence Association and Ulster Volunteer Force and BNSM members served with the English companies of these Ulster loyalist paramilitaries. The group, which had about 300 members by 1990, also sought links with European groups and was close to the Dutch former SS man Et Wolsink who was variously connected to Dutch People&#x27;s Union and the Dutch sections of the Wiking-Jugend and the Action Front of National Socialists/National Activists. Links were also built with the white power music scene of Blood and Honour and in particular with Ian Stuart Donaldson who, despite his previous membership of the NF, was close to Cat Mee, a BM organiser in Derbyshire. Donaldson&#x27;s attempts to leave the skinhead scene and scale back his involvement in music soured the relationship, however, and links were severed in 1990 after a group of activists turned up at Donaldson&#x27;s local pub and told him to play for them or face assault.

The progress of the BNSM was halted in the early 1990s by the emergence of Combat 18 with much of the membership switching allegiance to this new group. The new BM re-emerged during the mid-1990s by becoming heavily involved in the distribution of white power music. By this time Michael &#x27;Micky&#x27; Lane had taken over as leader (BM National Chairman) of the group from Daniel Tolan (with Stephen Frost becoming BM National Secretary), a position that meant Lane&#x27;s name appeared on an alleged Combat 18 hitlist due to the rivalries between the groups. Although a British Movement still exists, it has a tiny, largely inactive, membership. It does, however, maintain a presence on the internet, publishes a monthly newspaper called &quot;The Emblem&quot;, a monthly BM members&#x27; newsletter called &quot;The Sunwheel&quot; and a quarterly magazine called &quot;Broadsword&quot;, and is occasionally the subject of newspaper reports and media attention.

The Annual &quot;State of Hate&quot; Report for 2021 published by Hope Not Hate says that while the British Movement is a &quot;mere shadow of its heyday self from the early 1980s&quot; it has been &quot;surprisingly resilient&quot; and remains active during a period when many far-right groups have folded. &quot;It has active units in south London and Kent, South Wales, the East Midlands, Yorkshire and Humber, Scotland and Northern Ireland,&quot; the report says. &quot;Its activists hold meetings, host white power concerts, coordinate leafleting and postering sessions for activists and attend demonstrations and protests. It also produces a quarterly magazine and regular newsletters.&quot; A spokesperson for Campaign Against Antisemitism said, &quot;The persistence of far-right activity is totally unacceptable. It is particularly worrying that many of these groups deliberately target and recruit impressionable youngsters. The apparent endurance of the neo-nazi British National Socialist Movement is especially disconcerting, as is the formation of newer groups peddling similar antisemitic and racist ideologies.&quot;

=== Michael Gove assessment ===
On 14 March 2024, Michael Gove, the secretary of state for levelling up, housing and communities, speaking in Parliament, named the organisation as one of several regarded as &quot;a cause for concern&quot; and which will be assessed against a newly introduced official UK government definition of extremism.

<doc id="425496" wikidata="Q4816822" url="?curid=425496" title="Pearl incident">
<text>The &quot;Pearl&quot; incident was the largest recorded nonviolent escape attempt by enslaved people in United States history. On April 15, 1848, seventy-seven slaves attempted to escape Washington, D.C. by sailing away on a schooner called &quot;The Pearl&quot;. Their plan was to sail south on the Potomac River, then north up the Chesapeake Bay and Delaware River to the free state of New Jersey, a distance of nearly . The attempt was organized by both abolitionist whites and free blacks, who expanded the plan to include many more enslaved people. Paul Jennings, a former slave who had served President James Madison, helped plan the escape.

The escapees, including men, women, and children, found their passage delayed by winds running against the ship. Two days later, they were captured on the Chesapeake Bay near Point Lookout, Maryland, by an armed posse traveling by steamboat. As punishment, the owners sold most of the escapees to traders, who took them to the Deep South. Freedom for the two Edmonson sisters was purchased that year with funds raised by Henry Ward Beecher&#x27;s Plymouth Congregational Church in Brooklyn, New York.

When the ship and its captives were brought back to Washington, a pro-slavery riot broke out in the city. The mob attempted to attack an abolitionist newspaper and other known anti-slavery activists. Extra police patrolled for three days to try to contain the violence until the unrest ended. The episode provoked a slavery debate in Congress, and may have influenced a provision in the Compromise of 1850 that ended the slave trade in the District of Columbia, although not slavery itself. The escape inspired Harriet Beecher Stowe in writing her novel &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; (1852), in which people in slavery dreaded being &quot;sold South&quot;, and increased support for abolitionism in the North.

Three white men were initially charged on numerous counts with aiding the escape and transporting the captives; the captains Daniel Drayton and Edward Sayres were tried and convicted in 1848. After serving four years in prison, they were pardoned by President Millard Fillmore in 1852.

==Background==
Like the surrounding states of Maryland and Virginia and others in the South, Washington, D.C., was a &quot;slave society&quot; as defined by the historian Ira Berlin in his &quot;Many Thousands Gone: A History of Two Centuries of American Slavery&quot;. It supported a major slave market and was a center of the domestic slave trade; with its connection to the Chesapeake Bay by the Potomac River, Washington was an important transit point for captives being shipped or marched overland from the Upper South to markets or owners in the Deep South. Numerous families in the city actively enslaved people, generally forcing them to act as domestic servants and artisans. Some hired out their slaves to work as servants on the waterfront and in other urban jobs.

In 1848, free blacks outnumbered slaves in the District of Columbia by three to one. Abolitionists, both free blacks and whites, were active in the city in trying to end the slave trade and slavery. In addition, since the 1840s, there had been an organized group that supported the Underground Railroad in the district. The abolitionist community demonstrated in its planning for the escape that it could act in a unified way. They sought to plan an event that would capture the attention of Congress and the country to promote an end to slavery in the District of Columbia. White supporters included the abolitionists William L. Chaplin and Gerrit Smith of New York, who helped find the captain Daniel Drayton and pay for a ship. The black community made the project its own, notifying so many families that soon there were 77 slaves who wanted to be part of the escape.

For two days prior to the slaves&#x27; escape, many city residents had been celebrating the news from France of the expulsion of King Louis Philippe and the founding of the French Second Republic, with its assertion of universal human rights and liberty. Some free blacks and slaves were inspired by plans to gain similar freedoms for American slaves. People gathered to hear addresses in Lafayette Square in front of the White House. As the historian John H. Paynter recounted:

In April 1848, Washington Navy Yard blacksmith and former slave Daniel Bell, helped plan one of the largest and most daring slave escapes of the era. Daniel Bell was fearful that with the death of slaveholder Robert Armistead, his wife Mary and their children were to be sold. The Bell family had made numerous unsuccessful attempts to use the courts of the District of Columbia to secure their freedom. Ultimately Daniel&#x27;s wife Mary, eight of the Bell&#x27;s children, and two grandchildren would hazard the perilous journey on the schooner &quot;Pearl&quot;. Paul Jennings, a former slave of President James Madison, was among the free black organizers of the escape.

Among the slaves planning to leave were six grown siblings of the Paul and Amelia Edmonson family; because Amelia was a slave, their fourteen children had been born into slavery. Paul Edmonson was a free black. The two sisters and four brothers had all been &quot;hired out&quot; by their master to work for pay in the city. A variety of other families also hoped to escape. The Potomac River and Chesapeake Bay provided a water route to the free states of New Jersey and Pennsylvania, but the organizers had to acquire a ship to transport the slaves over the 225 miles of water. Jennings confessed his role in organizing the escape in a letter to his mentor, the northern senator Daniel Webster, an abolitionist. Jennings escaped public notice at the time for his role.

The captain found to pilot the ship, Daniel Drayton, was from Philadelphia and supported abolition, but admitted that he was offered money to transport the slaves. He found a ship and willing partner in Edward Sayres, the pilot of the 54-ton schooner &quot;The Pearl&quot;. His only other crew was Chester English, a cook. &quot;In the darkness of the night seventy-seven colored men, women, and children found their way to the schooner.&quot; With Drayton and Sayres accepting the risk of transporting them, on Saturday night, April 15, the slaves boarded the ship. Chester English, the cook, was on &quot;The Pearl&quot; to supply the passengers until they reached freedom.

==Escape plan and capture==
The organizers intended for the ship to sail down the Potomac River, then north up the Chesapeake Bay to freedom in New Jersey, a free state. But the wind was against the schooner, so the ship had to anchor for the night. The next morning, numerous slaveowners realized their slaves were missing and sent out an armed posse of 35 men aboard one slaveowner&#x27;s steamboat, &quot;The Salem&quot;.

Drayton described the capture of &quot;The Pearl&quot; in his later memoir:

The party on &quot;The Salem&quot; found &quot;The Pearl&quot; on Monday morning near Point Lookout in Maryland, upon which they immediately took the slaves and ship back to Washington.

===Betrayal===
In 1916, the author John H. Paynter identified Judson Diggs as the slave who had betrayed the fugitives. Diggs drove a participant to the dock and accepted the destitute fugitive&#x27;s promise of future payment. However, Diggs then reported the suspicious activity. Paynter, a descendant of the Edmonson siblings, interviewed descendants of the escapees. He wrote: &quot;Judson Diggs, one of their own people, a man who in all reason might have been expected to sympathize with their effort, took upon himself the role of Judas.&quot;

==Riots==
Supporters of slavery were outraged by the attempted escape, and an angry mob formed. For three days, crowds were riled in the Washington Riot, and numerous police were called in to protect one of their targets. They fixed on Gamaliel Bailey, the publisher of the anti-slavery newspaper &quot;New Era&quot;. Suspecting him because of his record of abolitionist publishing, a mob of slave owners almost destroyed the newspaper building but were held off by the police.

Once the mob dissipated, the slave owners debated how to punish their slaves. They sold all seventy-seven slaves to slave traders from Georgia and Louisiana, who would take them to the Deep South and the New Orleans slave market. There they would likely be sold to work on the large sugar and cotton plantations, which held two-thirds of the slaves in the South by the time of the Civil War. Congressman John I. Slingerland, an abolitionist from New York, alerted anti-slavery activists to the actions of the slave owners and slave traders, which helped increase the effort to end the slave trade in the nation&#x27;s capital. Friends and families scrambled to try to locate their loved ones and buy them from the traders before they were taken south. The case of the two young Edmonson sisters in particular attracted national attention. At least 50 of the recaptured slaves were sold to trader Hope H. Slatter who put them in Bernard M. Campbell&#x27;s Baltimore slave pen and then shipped south from there.

Illinois Congressman John Wentworth of Illinois told a story about the &quot;Pearl&quot; incident in his 1882 memoirs: 

(The only member of the Illinois delegation to the 30th Congress of 1847–48 who was not a member of the Democratic Party was one-term U.S. Representative Abraham Lincoln, a Whig.)

==Trial==
Drayton, Sayres, and English were initially indicted; the educator Horace Mann, who had helped the slaves from the &quot;La Amistad&quot; mutiny in 1839, was hired as their main lawyer. The following July, both Drayton and Sayres were charged with 77 counts each of aiding a slave escape and illegally transporting a slave. English was released because his role was minor and indirect.

After appeals were filed and charges were reduced, a jury convicted both Drayton and Sayres. They were sentenced to jail because neither could pay the fines associated with the convictions and the court costs, amounting to $10,000. After they had been imprisoned for four years, Senator Charles Sumner, an abolitionist, petitioned President Millard Fillmore for pardons for the men. The President pardoned them in 1852.

==Aftermath==
In response to the escape attempt and the riot, Congress ended the slave trade in the District of Columbia, although it did not abolish slavery. Prohibiting the slave trade was a provision of the Compromise of 1850, which dealt primarily with the issue of whether new states in the West would be admitted to the Union as slave states or as free states. Daniel Bell although an organizer was not on the Pearl at the time of its capture. While he may have been interrogated, he was fortunate in one respect as he was never charged with aiding or abetting the plot and was able to keep his job at the navy yard, although his wage was reduced from $1.20 per day to $1.12 per day. 

The failed attempt provoked reactions from abolitionists and pro-slavery activists across the country and contributed to the divisive rhetoric that ultimately led to the American Civil War. It also inspired Harriet Beecher Stowe in her writing of &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, an immediately popular anti-slavery novel published in 1852.

In 2017, a street in The Wharf development in Washington, D.C.&#x27;s Southwest Waterfront neighborhood was named &quot;Pearl Street&quot; in commemoration of the incident.

<text>Maurice Scully (1952 – 5 March 2023) was an Irish poet who worked in the modernist tradition. Scully was born in Dublin and educated at Trinity College. He was a member of Aosdana.

==Life==
After some years living in Italy, Africa and the west of Ireland, he settled with his wife and four children in Dublin.

Scully died in Bolea, Spain on 5 March 2023.

==The Beau==
The Beau was an annual literary journal edited by Scully. It ran to three issues: 1981, 1982/83 and 1983/84. Although the journal was short-lived, its contributor list, featuring writers from Ireland, Britain and the United States, was impressive and it played an important role in the emergence of a number of experimental Irish poets. It also carried reproductions by a number of Irish artists.

Contributors included Roy Fisher, Knute Skinner, William Oxley, Randolph Healy, Brian Coffey, David Wright, Paul Durcan, John Freeman, John Jordan, Anthony Cronin, Gavin Ewart, Eoghan Ó Tuairisc, George Barker, Dermot Bolger Billy Mills and Jim Burns.

The featured painters were Michael Mulcahy, Patrick Hall, Alice Hanratty and Patrick Pye.
