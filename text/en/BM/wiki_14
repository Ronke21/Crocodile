<text>Dai Jitao or Tai Chi-t&#x27;ao (; January 6, 1891 – February 21, 1949) was a Chinese journalist, an early Kuomintang member, and the first head of the Examination Yuan of the Republic of China. He is often referred to as Dai Chuanxian () or by his other courtesy name, Dai Xuantang ().

==Early life and education==

Dai was born Dai Liangbi () in Guanghan, Sichuan to a family of potters. He went to Japan in 1905 to study in a normal school and entered Nihon University&#x27;s law program in 1907. He graduated and returned to China in 1909.

==Writings==

Dai started to write for the Shanghaiese &quot;China Foreign Daily&quot; (中外日報) and &quot;Tianduo Newspaper&quot; (天鐸報) at 19. At this time, his sobriquet for himself was Dai Tianchou (天仇), or &quot;Heaven-Revenge Dai&quot;, to signify his dissatisfaction for the Qing Empire. The Qing officials threatened him with imprisonment for his writings, so in 1911 he fled to Japan, and then to Penang, where he joined Tongmenghui and wrote for its &quot;Guanghua Newspaper&quot; (光華報). Later that year, he returned to Shanghai after the Wuchang Uprising and founded the &quot;Democracy Newspaper&quot; (民權報).

==Political career==

Dai&#x27;s fluency in Japanese, unusual for a Chinese young man, attracted the attention of Sun Yat-sen. He became Sun&#x27;s translator and then his confidential secretary. After the Kuomintang failed to overthrow Yuan Shikai, he went to Tokyo to join the Chinese Revolutionary Party in 1914.

He attended the first national congress of the Chinese Kuomintang in 1924, where he was elected a member of the Central Executive Committee, then later a member of the Standing Committee, and the Minister of Propaganda. Soon after Sun&#x27;s death in 1925, he published a controversial book that reinterpreted Sun&#x27;s legacy. He claimed Sun derived his ideology chiefly from Confucianism instead of Western philosophies and that Sun was a traditionalist. This was praised by the KMT&#x27;s right-wing but condemned by leftists and communists. After the right&#x27;s triumph, Dai&#x27;s interpretation became the dominant one within the KMT. In 1926, he served as principal of the Sun Yat-sen University, and the chief of politics at Whampoa Academy, with Zhou Enlai as his deputy. From 1928 until 1948, he served as head of the Examination Yuan.

From October 1928 to June 1948, his official positions consisted of:
*State Councillor (國民政府國府委員)
*Director-General of Sun Yat-sen University (中山大學委員長)
*Member of Kuomintang Central Executive Committee (中央執行委員會委員): 1924
**Member of Standing Committee (常務委員): 1924
*Minister of Information (宣傳部長): 1924
*President of the Academia Historica (國史館館長): unable to attend due to illness

Dai was one of the lyricists of &quot;National Anthem of the Republic of China&quot;. He also wrote:
*&quot;The Fundamentals of the Principles of Sun Yat-sen&quot; (孫文主義之哲學基礎)
*&quot;The People&#x27;s Revolution and Kuomintang&quot; (國民革命與中國國民黨)
*&quot;The Complete Book of Sun Yat-sen&quot; (孫中山全書)
*&quot;National Flag Anthem of the Republic of China&quot; (中華民國國旗歌)

==Later years and death==

After Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s death in 1925, Dai changed his name to Chuanxian, &quot;Continuing-Virtue&quot;. He jumped into a river and was rescued by a fisherman. After this suicide experience, he converted to Buddhism and was accused by many of being superstitious. His works about Buddhism are published in &quot;The Collection of Mr. Dai Jitao&#x27;s Discussions on Buddhism&quot; (戴季陶先生佛學論集). He was widely known to be the birth father of Chiang Wei-kuo, the adoptive second son of Chiang Kai-shek. According to popular speculation, Dai believed knowledge of his extramarital affairs with the Japanese woman Shigematsu Kaneko would destroy his marriage and his career, so he entrusted Wei-kuo to Chiang Kai-shek, after the Japanese brought the infant to Shanghai. Yao Yecheng (姚冶誠), Chiang&#x27;s wife at the time, raised Wei-kuo as her own. The boy called Dai his &quot;Dear Uncle&quot; (親伯). Dai had also fathered a son, (安國), whom Dai later sent to Germany, to be educated at the Technische Hochschule in Charlottenburg (now Technische Universität Berlin). An-kuo (Ango) and Chiang Wei-kuo (Wego) were half brothers.

In 1949, with the Kuomintang losing the Chinese Civil War to the Chinese Communist Party, Dai committed suicide by swallowing over 70 sleeping pills in Guangzhou.

<text>In Christianity, deliverance ministry refers to groups that perform practices to cleanse people of demons and evil spirits. These groups attribute certain people&#x27;s physical, psychological, spiritual, and emotional problems to the activities of these evil spirits in their lives. Not all Christians accept the doctrines and practices of these ministries. 

Deliverance is meant to cast out evil spirits (a.k.a. &quot;demons&quot;), helping people overcome negative behaviors, feelings, and experiences through the power of the Holy Spirit. Each event is different, but many include some or all of these significant steps: diagnosis, naming the demon, expulsion, and some form of action taken by the afflicted person after their deliverance to keep the demon from returning. The distinction between deliverance ministry and exorcism is that while exorcism focuses largely on possession and is for believers and unbelievers alike, deliverance focuses more on spiritual oppression and is more for believers. In both cases in casting out spirits, intercessors are following the example of Jesus Christ and his disciples given in the New Testament.

== History ==

=== Biblical precedent ===
Many believers in deliverance ministry cite Biblical precedent as an authoritative source for their rituals; this forms a significant part in arguments surrounding deliverance practices. The Biblical precedent for cleansing people of evil spirits returns to Jesus.

The New Testament mentions Jesus casting out evil spirits fifty-five times but only describes the events in detail five times. He casts demons out of a man in a synagogue (Mark 1) and two men near tombs (Matthew 8). In both episodes, Jesus converses with the demons, and they acknowledge him as the Son of God before he casts them out. This is a common occurrence in modern deliverance rituals as well. Jesus also casts demons out of a little girl (Mark 7) and a young boy (Luke 9), both events that the Bible expressly connects to strengthening the faith of their parents; modern practitioners of deliverance ministry interpret their experiences expelling demons as an opportunity to strengthen their own faith as well. Jesus heals a possessed man (Matthew 12) to show his Messianic calling and the fulfilment of prophecy, leading modern believers to see successful exorcisms as evidence of Jesus&#x27; power in their lives.

Jesus&#x27; disciples also cast out demons many times throughout the New Testament. This occurs before and after Jesus&#x27; death and resurrection. After his death and resurrection, believers interpret the events as proof of the authority the disciples still have through faith in Jesus. Each exorcism event is different in the Bible, and the methods used to cast out demons change; some participants in modern deliverance ministry interpret this to mean that there is no &quot;right&quot; or single way to cast out demons, but that many methods may be used as long as they are rooted in Christianity. Practitioners of deliverance ministry pay careful attention to each of these Biblical examples as they navigate and interpret demonic activity and deliverance rituals in their own lives.

However, it is worth noting that, even in the New Testament, there are reported cases where the disciples themselves were unable to cast out demons, having to resort directly to Jesus, or even others, who were not direct followers of Jesus, failed when trying to cast out demons by invoking His name. There is also the reminder that, even those who say they are capable of casting out demons in the name of Jesus, will be repudiated by Him on the Last Judgment, for not having been able to faithfully fulfill His word.

=== Post-Biblical deliverance practices ===
Exorcism was practiced by Catholics throughout the Middle Ages. Martin Luther practiced it in Germany during the 1500s as a way of participating in the &quot;war with the devil,&quot; a tradition continued by Lutherans throughout the Reformation to the present day. He simplified the ceremony to avoid drawing attention to evil powers. Deliverance practices became somewhat more widespread with the growth of the Pentecostal movement, and especially with the Charismatic movement that began in the 1960s. These movements continue to understand themselves as part of spiritual warfare, in which Christians are understood to be at war with the forces of evil which work in the world in efficient ways, afflicting people with all kinds of problems (physical, emotional, spiritual). People believe they can combat these evil forces through the power and authority of God.

== Sources of demonic presence ==
According to believers in oppression, demons are believed to be able to enter a person&#x27;s life in many different ways. Some believe that objects, by their very nature, harbor demons; for example, certain types of literature, especially if it leads the reader to question their faith and other media such as fantasy/horror novels or films, Dungeons and Dragons or other types of role-playing games, CD recordings of alleged satanic music, art with non-religious or blasphemous/sinful themes, or artifacts depicting pagan gods. Sacred texts (false religious texts) or simple decorations from a non-Christian religion may also be a hiding place for demons. Other types are objects with a sinful history (e.g. a piece of jewelry from an adulterous relationship, an object purchased with greed, etc.).

Demons can also be said to &quot;run in families.&quot; The usual cause is ancestors who were Satanists, Freemasons, or witches, or who died unrepentant of terrible sins such as abuse, adultery, or murder. Some claim that negative traits and practices run in families because of the demonic presence that is passed down from parent to child. Others claim that physical ailments and persistent problems such as poverty and addictive behaviors (drugs, pornography, etc.) can be caused by ancestral sin and the resulting family curses.

==Methods==

=== Diagnosis ===
Deliverance ministries focus on casting out the spirit or spirits believed to cause an affliction. The person must first be &quot;diagnosed&quot; with the presence/possession of an evil spirit, which often requires the participation of a person who is trained or experienced in this area. This expert may ask questions to learn about the person&#x27;s life and try to discover if they have committed any sins that might invite a demonic presence; if they have, they must repent of that sin as part of the deliverance process. The expert might question the person about their relationships with their spouse, children, and friends, as poor relationships with closer circle may be evidence of a demonic presence. They may also ask about their extended family and ancestors to determine if the demon might be the result of a family curse. They can attempt to discern if an object or a room is the source of the demonic activity and help the person understand what may have attached the demon to that object or space. Some may be able to see demons or hear their names through the Holy Spirit. Once the source of the demonic presence is identified, it is cast out through the renouncing of any contract made with the spirit and any lies accepted, and commanded to leave by the power of the Holy Spirit.

Some believe that an ordained member of a clergy must perform the deliverance, while others believe that anyone can have that spiritual power. Diagnosis may occur in private spaces, or during public meetings as the Holy Spirit is invited to reveal the presence of demons in the attendees or while the &quot;preacher&quot; walks through the audience forcing demons to manifest themselves in the audience.

=== Naming the demon ===
Revealing the demon&#x27;s name may be part of the expulsion process, as it gives the person casting out the demon authority over it. This process is not required to cast out the demon, and some adherents do not accept it (some believe that demons can give the wrong name). Still, others believe it is necessary. The presence may identify itself or be identified as a specific demon (e.g. Jezebel, Asherah, Baal, etc.) or its &quot;name&quot; might be the name of the sin or affliction it represents (e.g. rebellion, gluttony, sexual perversion, anorexia nervosa). Explicitly identifying the problem may prepare the healed preacher and the healed person to expel the demon.

=== Expulsion of demons ===
Various methods are used to expel demons. Some adherents recite Biblical verses about casting out demons, or pray; many also invoke &quot;the blood of Jesus,&quot; a reference to Jesus suffering for people&#x27;s sins and intervening with God on behalf of humanity. In this context, invoking the blood of Jesus is calling on him to intervene specifically on behalf of the possessed individual. The person performing the deliverance might touch the possessed person, or anoint them with oil or water. People may also perform rituals over objects that contain evil spirits, destroy them by breaking or burning them, then remove them from the home. If a place has evil spirits because of sins committed there in the past, people may repent on behalf of those who committed the sins as part of casting out the evil spirits. This is meant to force a demon to leave an afflicted person, place, or thing. The demon may resist the expulsion using the body of the possessed person and may speak, scream, cry, laugh, vomit, or lash out physically. exorcism or deliverance rituals can be loud, dramatic, and highly emotional experiences for those involved. Once the demon is gone, people often feel like a weight or darkness has left them.

=== Post-deliverance maintenance ===
According to believers in possession, a demon may return after a successful deliverance meeting if proper precautions are not taken. To avoid this, a person must pray over their own being as well as their home for God&#x27;s protection over them. Because the Holy Spirit is believed to be stronger than the demons, the person remains protected. If needed, the person may have to take other steps of action as well, such as removing certain media from their home and creating boundaries with certain individuals who may have &quot;spread&quot; the spirit(s) to them.

Certain Christian theologians have held that the wearing of a head covering by Christian females confers protection against fallen angels, which they teach is referenced in .

== Formal work of ministries ==
Ministries can organize the removal from homes of items that are believed to harbor demons. Members are instructed to burn items that are related to Idolatry, &quot;demon drawing&quot; symbols, and music that summons demons. Rev. Don Jeffrey, an exorcist in Arizona, states that any of these objects should be exorcised of evil spirits and blessed before burning them or sending them to the dump. For example, some believe that ouija boards can act like a gateway for the demonic and must be exorcised and blessed, as the gate must be closed before it is destroyed.

For some Christians, deliverance ministries are activities carried out by specialists such as Bishop Larry Gaiters, Rev Miguel Bustillos, and Rev Vincent Bauhaus, or groups aimed at solving problems related to demons and spirits, especially possession of the body and soul, but not the spirit. Ministries like Ellel Ministries International, Don Dickerman Ministries, and Neil T. Anderson explicitly teach that a Christian cannot have demons in their spirit because the Holy Spirit lives there. However, they can have demons in their body or soul due to inner emotional wounds, sexual abuse, or Satanic ritual abuse. This is usually known as partial possession or demonic infestation, as opposed to outside demonic oppression which does not reside in any of the three parts of a person: body, soul, spirit.

==Deliverance vs. exorcism==
While some people interchange the terms &quot;exorcism&quot; and &quot;deliverance,&quot; others distinguish between the two. According to the latter school of thought, exorcisms are carried out through the use of various rituals of exorcism, such as those in the Roman Ritual, and often utilize attendant sacramentals such as holy water. In contrast, deliverance is not as ritualistic and may look different from meeting to meeting depending on the level of oppression, and how the Holy Spirit guides the meeting. (For example, while one may have to take some time to forgive others, another might not have any one to have to forgive, and may have to spend more time renouncing lies.) Others claim that &quot;deliverance&quot; and &quot;exorcism&quot; refer to the same practice but that exorcism is a more intense form and is used in more complex or extreme cases. Deliverance ministries seek to discern the influences that are more subtlety spiritual, and if needed, discern the root of them, whether it be from another or self-introduced. The individual must take responsibility and be involved in the process.

Some deliverance ministers do use crucifixes, holy water, and anointing oils, as well as the Bible. Some deliverance ministers who also use the term &quot;exorcist&quot; wear the clerical collar (first used by Presbyterians) and also incorporate a stole.

==Prominent figures==

Frank Hammond and his wife Ida Mae have been called &quot;perhaps the most influential practitioners of deliverance ministry.&quot; Their book &quot;Pigs in the Parlor: A Practical Guide to Deliverance,&quot; published in 1973, is one of the most influential books on the topic, and has sold over a million copies. In diagnosing demonic presence, they focused more on the moral, ethical, and spiritual signs of possession rather than more dramatic physical manifestations like writhing on the ground. As the title indicates, their book takes less of a theoretical/theological approach to deliverance; it&#x27;s meant to be used by believers in real-life situations and includes tools like seven signs of demonic possession and how to recognize when a demon has departed following a ritual.

Reverend Bob Larson has also achieved widespread public notoriety, not just within the deliverance ministry movement itself. Larson is known for drawing media attention to deliverance practices; he performs exorcisms in front of live audiences, teaches exorcism workshops, and even had his own reality TV show, bringing a sort of theatrical quality to exorcism. His daughter Brynne and her friends Tess and Savannah were featured on news channels in 2012 under the title &quot;the teenage exorcists,&quot; even gaining the attention of news organizations and publications as well known as BBC News and People magazine.

<text>Guanajuato, officially the Free and Sovereign State of Guanajuato, is one of the 32 states that make up the Federal Entities of Mexico. It is divided into 46 municipalities and its capital city is Guanajuato. 

It is located in central Mexico and is bordered by the states of Jalisco to the west, Zacatecas to the northwest, San Luis Potosí to the north, Querétaro to the east, and Michoacán to the south. It covers an area of . The state is home to several historically important cities, especially those along the &quot;Bicentennial Route&quot;, which retraces the path of Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla&#x27;s insurgent army at the beginning of the Mexican War of Independence. This route begins at Dolores Hidalgo, and passes through the Sanctuary of Atotonilco, San Miguel de Allende, Celaya, and the capital of Guanajuato. Other important cities in the state include León, the state&#x27;s biggest city, Salamanca, and Irapuato. The first town established by the Spaniards in Guanajuato is Acámbaro while the first to be named a city is Salvatierra.

Guanajuato is between the arid north of the country and the lusher south, and is geographically part of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, the Mexican Plateau. It was initially settled by the Spanish in the 1520s due to mineral deposits found around the city of Guanajuato, but areas such as the Bajío region also became important for agriculture and livestock. Mining and agriculture were the mainstays of the state&#x27;s economy, but have since been eclipsed by the secondary sector. Guanajuato has particularly seen growth in the automotive industry. The name Guanajuato comes from Purépecha (or in older orthography &quot;quanax huato&quot;), which means &quot;frog hill&quot;.

==Geography==
Guanajuato is in the center of Mexico, northwest of Mexico City, bordering Zacatecas, San Luis Potosí, Michoacán, Querétaro, and Jalisco. It is the 20th-largest of Mexico&#x27;s states, with an area of 30,589 km2. It has an average altitude of above sea level, with its territory divided among three of Mexico&#x27;s physical regions, the Sierra Madre Oriental, the Mexican Plateau and the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. The Sierra Madre Oriental in Guanajuato consists of the Sierra Gorda and the Sierra del Azafrán in the northeast. The Mexican Plateau extends through the center of the state. It is subdivided into various regions parted by low-lying mountain chains such as the Sierra de la Cuatralba and the Sierra de Cubo. The Trans Mexican Volcanic Belt crosses the state in the south and includes the Bajío area, the Altos de Jalisco and the valleys area in the far south. The state is crossed by several mountain ranges with mountains between 2,300 and 3,000 meters high. Mountain ranges average 2,305 meters and flat areas lie at around 1,725 meters above mean sea level. Other important mountain ranges include the Sierra Gorda to the north, the Sierra de Guanajuato in the southeast, the Comanja in the northwest and the Codorniz in the east.

The state is divided into five regions, taking into consideration geography and climate: Altos de Guanajuato, La Sierra Central, Bajío, La Sierra Gorda, and Los Valles del Sur. The Altos de Guanajuato, in the north, are a chain of forested mountains interspersed with pastures, small fields and areas with cacti and other desert plants. They begin near the border with San Luis Potosí, and extend south to Dolores Hidalgo, San Miguel de Allende, and the Querétaro border. This area&#x27;s altitude varies from 1,800 meters to peaks over 2,900, such as La Giganta and La Sierra del Cubo. The climate is mostly semiarid with a rainy season in the summer, with average temperatures between 15 and 20 °C. Winter lows often reach 0 °C or lower with frosts. Wildlife is found mostly in the most rugged and inaccessible areas and includes deer, coyotes, eagles and rattlesnakes.

La Sierra Gorda is shared between Guanajuato and Querétaro and is considered an important biosphere. This area is the most rugged in the state where most of the natural areas and small villages remain intact due to their inaccessibility. The Sierra Gorda is part of the Sierra Madre Occidental, with extreme variations in its geography and climate. The rugged terrain means that there are a wide number and variety of micro-climates, although average temperatures vary only between 16 and 19 °C. It lowest point is a canyon called Paso de Hormigas in Xichú at 650 meters above sea level with a very warm climate suitable for tropical fruit. The highest point is Pinal de Zamorano at 3,300 meters, followed by El Picacho de Pueblo Nuevo, El Zorillo and El Cuervo, all above 2,700 meters. The largest changes are seen in arid versus wetter zones, which can often be relatively nearby, with foliage changing from rainforest to pine forest to desert landscapes. In 1997, the federal government declared the Sierra Gorda region in Querétaro a Biosphere Reserve, with Guanajuato&#x27;s portion added in 2007. On the Guanajuato side, it covers 236,882 hectares over the municipalities of Xichú, San Luis de la Paz, Atarjea, Victoria and Santa Catarina. Culturally, the Sierra Gorda region is the far western part of La Huasteca, which extends over parts of Querétaro, San Luis Potosí, Hidalgo and Veracruz.

The Sierra Central is a series of low, gentle mountains in the center of the state that are part of the Sierra Madre Occidental. They cover 12 municipalities: Ocampo, San Felipe, León, Silao, Guanajuato, Dolores Hidalgo, San Miguel de Allende, Irapuato, Salamanca, Santa Cruz de Juventino Rosas, Comonfort and Apaseo el Grande. Wild vegetation runs from tropical rainforest to arid grasslands with cactus, with cypress trees along rivers and other surface water. Wildlife includes raccoons, quail, rabbits, skunks and migratory birds. The land is productive, especially for fruit orchards producing guavas, tejocote, apples, limes, quince and more. Desert fruits such as cactus pears (tuna), garambullos and xoconostle are also produced commercially.

The state&#x27;s best-known geographical region is the Bajío, a relatively low and flat area of between 1,700 and 1,800 meters that surrounds the Lerma River and its tributaries. Centered in Guanajuato, parts also extend into Querétaro and Jalisco. This low area is the source of its name, coming from the Spanish word &quot;bajo&quot; or low. The Bajío is filled with rolling hills and interrupted by the occasional chain of low mountains such as the Gavia and the Culiacán. Before the Spanish arrived, this area was covered in dense forests of holm oak and mesquite trees, but mining&#x27;s need for wood fuel eventually cleared them. Today, the area is the center of most of the state&#x27;s agriculture and industry since the terrain allows for highways and large farms, which produce grains, vegetables and fruit. This farmland is considered some of Mexico&#x27;s most productive.

Los Valles del Sur, also called the Valles Abajeños, are valleys located in southwestern Guanajuato, bordering Michoacán. This area is distinguished by the large number of Purépecha place names and covers the municipalities of Valle de Santiago, Yuriria, Tarimoro, Apaseo el Alto, Moroleón, Uriangato, Santiago Maravatío, Acámbaro, Jerécuaro, Coroneo and Tarandacuao. The area is part of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, with elevations ranging between 1,700 and 2,000 meters. The soil is fertile due to its volcanic base, producing crops such as sorghum, wheat, corn and vegetables. The land also produces building materials such as tezontle and black sandstone. In the higher elevations, there are forests of pine and holm oak but these have been much reduced by deforestation. The more arid areas have mesquite, nopal and other desert plants. There are several small lakes, the best known being Lake Yuriria as well as canyons and cave systems, some of which were used for ceremonial purposes by pre-Hispanic peoples. It is also the home the Siete Luminarias de Valle de Santiago, a set of seven inactive volcanic craters in the northwest and southwest of the Santiago Valley. The volcano cones rise abruptly out of the ground with craters up to one kilometer across. Locals call the formations &quot;holes&quot; (&quot;hoyos&quot;) and they are named La Alberca, La Cíntora, Estrada, Blanca, Alvarez, Solís and Rincón de Parangueo. La Cíntora and Rincón de Parangueo contain cave paintings and evidence that people once lived in the craters. La Alberca (&quot;The Pool&quot;) is a crater lake open to the public for swimming, rowing or boating. The name of Siete Luminarias (&quot;Seven Lanterns&quot;) comes from an imagined prehistoric time when the seven were active at once.

The state has about 1,500 bodies of surface water, along with underground aquifers in most parts of the state. Its principal lake is Lake Cuitzeo, on the border with Michoacán and the Yuriria. Several of the Siete Luminarias craters have also developed crater lakes, especially La Joya, Parangueo and Olla de Zìntora. The most important river in Guanjuato and one of the most important in the country is the Lerma, along with its tributaries Guanajuato River, La Laja, and Turbio. The Lerma river basin covers 81% of the state (center and south); the Pánuco River basin (north of the state) and Cuitzeo Lake cover the remainder. The Lerma is regulated by various dams in part to control the fact that it ran very high in the rainy season and very low in the dry season. These dams include the Ignacio Allende, la Purísima, Solís, La Gavia, Conejo II and Santa Ifigenia.
===Climate===
Climates in the state are grouped by precipitation and average temperatures into three major groups. The semiarid climate is characterized by the fact that evaporation often exceeds precipitation. Most of the vegetation in these areas is arid grassland with desert plants such as nopal. These climates cover about 40% of the state, mostly in the north. Semiarid temperate regions are found in the municipalities of San Felipe, San Diego de la Unión, San Luis de la Paz, part of Dolores Hidalgo and San José de Iturbide, where precipitation varies between 400 and 500 mm and the average temperature is between 16 and 18 °C. Semiarid semihot climates can be found north of Dolores Hidalgo, around León and in areas near Celaya. In these municipalities, rainfall averages between 600 and 700 mm and the average annual temperature is between 18 and 20 °C. Temperate climates are judged by the presence of oak and pine forest, pine forests and/or pine forests with meadows. Humidity varies in these forest regions. Temperate semi-moist areas are mostly found in the southeast municipalities of Apaseo, Coroneo and Jerécuaro and in the center of the state. Precipitation varies from 600 to 700 mm and the average temperature is between 16 and 18 °C. Temperate and somewhat humid climates have rainfall averages of between 700 and 800 mm, with temperatures between 16 and 18 °C. These can be found in Pénjamo, Coroneo, Jerécuaro and parts of Guanajuato (municipality) and Dolores Hidalgo. Temperate climates with the most humidity are in Santa Rosa and municipality of Guanajuato. These have rainfall averages over 800 mm and average temperatures under 16 °C. Hot and moist climates in the state have temperatures ranging from 18 to 22 °C and are associated with tropical rainforest, with some grassland. These climates are subdivided into two types, one that receives less rainfall with a significant dry season and one that is wetter. The drier type is found in Abasolo, Irapuato, Salamanca and Romita. In total, these hot and relatively moist climates can be found in about 40% of the state.

===Ecology===
From the beginning of the colonial period, much of Guanajato&#x27;s environment suffered greatly from the mining techniques and intensive agriculture the Spanish introduced. The process has been ongoing since then to modern times. Before the conquest, the state was covered in forests, but mining requires large amounts of fuel to process minerals, so they were cut down for fuel and construction projects. Agriculture leached nutrients from the soil, caused erosion, and introduced plants, animals and diseases that have had a large impact.

Today, the state contains 21 protected areas that extend over 63,611 hectares in 26 municipalities. These include Sierra de Lobos, Siete Luminarias, the Silva Dam, Megaparque de Dolores Hidalgo, Cuenca de la Esperanza, Las Fuentes, Peña Alta, Pinal de Zamorano, Parque Metropolitano, La Joya Crater, Lake Yuriria, Las Musas, Culiacán and La Gavia Mountains, Sierra de los Agustinos, Sierra de Pénjamo, Cerro de Cubilete, Cerro de Amoles, La Purisima Dam, Arandas Mountain, La Soledad Dam, and the upper basin of the Temascatío River. Another protected area is the Sierra Gorda Biosphere Reserve. In Guanajuato, it extends over 236,882 hectares and contains 182 bird species, 42 mammal species and 84 plant species, including two recently discovered ones, &quot;Beaucamea compacta&quot; and &quot;Beaucarnea glassiana&quot; (formerly known as &quot;Calibanus glassianus&quot;). The park contains a number of species in danger of extinction, including the black bear and the puma. The climate is semiarid with variations in temperature due to altitude changes, but most of the area is covered in tropical forest in which many plants lose leaves during the dry season from November to May.


==History==

===Pre-Hispanic era===
In the pre-Hispanic era, the Bajio saw the most human development due to the fertility of the soil and the presence of surface water for agriculture. The oldest group to inhabit the area were the people now known as the Chupícuarios, who dominated the center of the Bajío area and were active between 800 BCE and 300 CE. Their largest city is now the site called Chupícuaro, and their influence was widespread being found in the modern states of Zacatecas, Querétaro, Colima, Nayarit, Hidalgo, State of Mexico, Michoacán and Guerrero. Chupícuaro cities were associated with the Toltec city of Tula and when this city fell, these agricultural cities of Guanajuato also went into decline. This and a prolonged drought cause these cities to be abandoned between the 10th and 11th centuries with only the Guamares left ethnically.

Then Chichimeca and other nomadic groups entered the area. These nomadic indigenous groups are generically referred to as Chichimeca, but in reality they were a variety of ethnicities such as the Guachichiles, Chichimeca Jonaz and Guamares. These groups were warlike, semi nomadic and did not practice significant agriculture, nor did they construct cities. Part of the state was also inhabited by the Otomi but they were mostly displaced or dominated by the Purépecha in the southwest and the Chichimeca in other parts. By the 16th century, most of Mesoamerica was dominated by either the Aztec Empire or Purépecha Empire, but Guanajuato was under the control of neither. It was on the northern border of the Purépecha Empire with southern Guanajuato showing significant cultural influence in the southern valleys, and Aztecs had ventured into the area looking for minerals. However, most of the state was dominated by various Chichimeca tribes as part of what the Spanish would call the &quot;Gran Chichimeca&quot;. These Chichimeca were mostly nomadic with some scattered agricultural communities, mostly in the north.

=== Spanish colonial period ===

As the area of Guanajuato lies on the boundary of the arid north of Mexico, at first relatively few Spanish came to settle - as opposed to points south, which had much more abundant rainfall and indigenous labor. The first Spanish expedition to visit the Guanajuato area, led by Cristóbal de Olid in 1522, arrived in the Yuririhapúndaro and Pénjamo areas. The discovery of silver and gold in the area of the city of Guanajuato spurred Spanish settlement of the area in the 1520s and 1530s.
Following the Spanish arrival, native tribes retreated to the most inaccessible areas of the Bajío and to the mountain ranges in the state, resisting the invaders, attacking settlements and travelers along the routes that connected Spanish settlements and mining camps. The Spanish were unable to force the natives of this area (unlike the more settled indigenous peoples) to work, and brought African slaves and indigenous peoples from other areas to work the haciendas and mines. The colonization efforts in the eastern part of the state began in 1542 when Spanish land-grants were issued for the Apaseo and Chamácuaro areas. In 1555 San Miguel el Grande was founded to protect roads linking mining camps and cities with Mexico City to the south-east. The Villa de León was founded in 1576 to counter attacks by the indigenous peoples. But through the first centuries of the colonial period, the city of Guanajuato dominated because of its mines. The official name of the state is &quot;Guanajuato, Estado Libre y Soberano&quot; (Guanajuato, Free and Sovereign State). &quot;Guanajuato&quot; comes from Purépecha &quot;Quanaxhuato&quot;, which has been translated as both &quot;place of frogs&quot; and &quot;places of many hills&quot;. The coat of arms of the state is that of the city of Guanajuato, as granted by Carlos I of Spain ().

In 1590 the Villa de San Luis de la Paz was founded and named after the peace (&quot;paz&quot;) treaty between the Spanish and the Chichimeca. With the Spanish occupying most of the most productive land and its resources, the indigenous of the area became extremely impoverished. This eventually allowed the Spanish to negotiate peace with chiefs in exchange for basic goods such as blankets, clothes and food. This would bring temporary truces. Evangelization efforts would bring longer-term submission. Franciscans and Augustinians worked to gradually modify the worldview of the Chichimecas and others until many moved out of the mountains and into other settlements and professed, at least nominally, the Catholic faith. However, the indigenous remained extremely marginalized and poor, losing both their language and their culture until most eventually intermarried with outsiders to produce mestizos.
Through the Spanish colonial period, most of the area&#x27;s wealth came from mining, with much of the agriculture springing up to support the mining communities. The height of mining came in the 18th century, mostly from the mines in the hills around the city of Guanajuato, leading to the construction of a large number of notable civil and religious buildings in the same area. The extremely fertile Bajío area became a major agricultural area for New Spain. Both mining and agriculture brought in more Spanish and Criollos to take advantage, as well as mestizos and some African slaves to work the mines and fields, making the area&#x27;s population grow rapidly and eventually concentrate in urban centers. The area became an intendancy () or province in 1786, when the authorities divided New Spain into twelve parts.

===Independence and 19th century===

Despite the riches the area produced, most lived in oppression and poverty at the end of the 18th century, working on haciendas and in mines while a few, mostly European-born Spaniards, lived in opulence. Not only the indigenous, mestizo and Negro slaves were having problems with the social order. Many Criollos or New World-born Spanish were marginalized by the Spain-born. One of the first rebellions against colonial rule came in 1766, when a group attacked the Caja Real in Guanajuato city to protest high taxes. In 1767, there were protests against the expulsion of the Jesuits by the Spanish Crown. These were put down with extreme force, but they spurred conspiracies, and groups organizing against colonial rule, especially in San Miguel el Grande and León.

Numerous plans were made, but few were carried out or had impact until 1809. In that year, a group consisting of Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, Ignacio Allende, Juan Aldama, Miguel Domínguez and more, began to plan an armed revolt against the colonial government. In 1810, the plot was discovered and Hidalgo decided to put their plans into action in September instead of the planned date in December. On 15 September, Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla declared the Grito de Dolores in the town of Dolores (Hidalgo). Hidalgo, accompanied by Ignacio Allende, left Dolores with about 800 men, half of whom were on horseback. Through sheer numbers, Hidalgo&#x27;s army had some early victories, progressing through the economically important and densely populated province of Guanajuato. One of Hidalgo&#x27;s first stops was at the Sanctuary of Atotonilco. There, Hidalgo affixed an image of the Virgin to a lance to adopt it as his banner. He then inscribed the following slogans on his troops&#x27; flags: &quot;Long live religion! Long live our most Holy Mother of Guadalupe! Long live Ferdinand VII! Long live America and death to bad government!&quot; The extent and the intensity of the movement took viceregal authorities by surprise. San Miguel and Celaya were captured with little resistance. On 21 September 1810, Hidalgo was proclaimed general and supreme commander after arriving at Celaya. At this point, Hidalgo&#x27;s army numbered about 50,000. However, due to lack of military discipline, the insurgents soon fell into robbing, looting and ransacking the towns they were capturing. On 28 September 1810, Hidalgo arrived at the city of Guanajuato. The town&#x27;s Spanish and Criollo populations took refuge in the heavily fortified Alhóndiga de Granaditas granary defended by Quartermaster Riaños. Hidalgo&#x27;s army overwhelmed the defenses in two days and killed an estimated 400–600 men, women and children. Fighting associated with the War of Independence would return near the end of the conflict. Military commanders Luis de Cortázar and Anastasio Bustamante joined forces with Agustín de Iturbide and took the city of Guanajuato on 8 July 1821, declaring the entire state independent of Spanish rule. In 1824, Guanajuato was officially proclaimed a state of Mexico by the Constitutional Congress of Mexico.
The years after the end of the War of Independence were extremely unstable, and would continue to be unstable through most of the rest of the 19th century. The towns of Dolores and San Miguel adopted the names of Dolores Hidalgo and San Miguel de Allende in honor of those who began the independence movement and in 1826, the first constitution of the state of Guanajuato was adopted. Like much of the rest of the country, Guanajuato was affected by the prolonged fighting between Liberal and Conservative factions as well as the foreign incursions that dominated the 19th century. Guanajuato&#x27;s status vacillated between state (when Liberals were in charge) and department (when Conservatives held the upper hand). Under Liberal ideals, educational institutions such as the Colegio de la Santisima Trinidad and the Colegio de la Purisima Concepción were secularized and under control of the State. In 1847, General Gabriel Valencia raised an army of 6,000 men to fight the U.S. invasion of Mexico. In 1848, in opposition to the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, General Marian Paredes, General Manuel Doblado and priest Celedonio Dómeco de Jarauta revolted, taking the state capital, but they were defeated and Doméco was executed by firing squad. In 1855, Conservative Manuel Doblado, then the governor of Guanajuato, forced Juan Álvarez out of the presidency after he took power from Antonio López de Santa Anna. In 1858, the government under President Benito Juárez moved from Mexico City to the city of Guanajuato before moving again to Manzanillo and then Veracruz during the Reform War. During this three-year period, the state would vacillate various times between the Liberals and Conservatives. In 1863, it was taken over by the French as they installed Maximilian I as emperor of Mexico. Maximillian did not reign long but the governor he appointed for Guanajuato, Florencio Antillón remained in Guanajuato until 1877.

===Mexican Revolution to the present===
The situation stabilized over much of the government of Porfirio Díaz at the end of the 19th century and the economy improved, but the Diaz government was oppressive. Diaz installed Francisco Mena as governor of the state, who made a fortune through the concession of railway lines which were being built to modernize the country. Even though slavery was officially abolished during the War of Independence, most laborers in farms and mines were extremely underpaid and in a number of cases not paid at all. Agricultural production reached a peak at the end of the 19th century, earning the state the nickname of the &quot;granary of the Republic&quot;. Industrialization took hold in cities such as León, Salvatierra, Celaya and San Francisco del Rincón, making shoes, textiles and hats. One battle of the Mexican Revolution occurred in Celaya in 1915 between the troops of Álvaro Obregón and Francisco Villa. Many from the state fought and died in other parts of Mexico, leaving behind widows and children. After the war, the large landholdings were broken up and land redistributed into ejidos, or commonly held land, which benefitted many rural families.

After the end of the Mexican Revolution, fighting in Mexico continues with the Cristero War. Fighting related to this was most prominent in Pénjamo and León, but occurred in other areas as well. In 1946, an uprising against the government by a group called the Sinarquistas occurred in Leon. However, most of the state was peaceful most of the time, allowing the economy to recover. This was especially true of the agricultural sector, producing wheat, corn, sorghum, alfalfa, strawberries in Irapuato and goats in various parts. Goat milk cajeta candy from Celaya is known in most of Mexico. The first Festival Internacional Cervantino occurred in 1972. In the 1980s, two of the state&#x27;s cities, Guanajuato and San Miguel de Allende were declared World Heritage Sites.

Today, the Bajio is one of the major grain producing regions in Mexico. The Guanajuato congress has asked for help against the theft of religious art in the state, which has the third highest incidence of such. One of the major occurrences was the theft of the gold crown of the Black Christ of Salamanca in 2010. The celebration of Mexico&#x27;s Bicentennial was particularly important to the state as initial events of the War in Independence occurred here. The state set up a Bicentennial Route to encourage visitors to the cities associated with Miguel Hidalgo&#x27;s first campaigns. The state held a marathon from San Miguel Allende to Dolores Hidalgo for the Bicentennial with Omar Luna winning with a time of 2h23m14s. The state sponsored the Expo Bicentenario 2010 from 17 July to 20 November just outside the capital city. The site was marked by a giant Mexican flag flying alongside older historic flags, including a replica of the standard with an image of the Virgin of Guadalupe that Miguel Hidalgo carried as the insurgent banner. The Expo was housed in a series of pavilions which demonstrated the Mexican culture, history, traditions and customs. There were also pavilions hosted by various Latin American countries who also celebrated their Bicentennials around the same time. In 2023, the southern town of Salvatierra experienced a mass shooting at a private Christmas party in which 12 people were left dead and 25 were left injured. 

==Demographics==


As of 2005, the state had a population of 4,893,812, which is the sixth largest population in Mexico. About 67% live in urban areas, with the rest in rural areas, and women slightly outnumbering men. The largest population centers are León with 1,134,842 people, Irapuato with 440,134, Celaya with 382,958, and Salamanca with 226,654.

===Religion===
Over 94% of the population professes the Catholic religion, and the state is considered to be very conservative and adherent to Catholic principles both socially and politically.

===Indigenous peoples===
Guanajuato has the fourth lowest number of people who can speak an indigenous language. However, the ethnically indigenous population is about 10,347 (2005) or 2.6% of the population over the age of five. The languages spoken are Chichimeca Jonaz, Otomi and Nahuatl. The two most important indigenous groups are the Chichimeca Jonaz and the Otomi, both of which are concentrated in the Valles de Sur area. Culturally, both groups show significant Purépecha influence. Both live in arid regions, where rainfall is precious and the diet includes foods such as pitayas, Myrtillocactus geometrizans (garambullo), cactus pear, nopal and agave. Hunting was an important source of protein but the scarcity of game has all but extinguished this practice. Subsistence agriculture forms the basis of the economy and provides much of the current diet. However, these peoples are extremely poor, and many migrate to other places to find work.
In what is now the state of Guanajuato, there were a number Nahua) groups who built cities in the first millennium CE. but then abandoned them long before the arrival of the Spanish. It is believed that the Chichimeca came to dominate the area after the fall of these cities, and the Chichimeca Jonaz believe that the eagle, which is sacred to them, led them here. At the time of the Spanish conquest, the only Chichimeca group left were the Chichimeca Jonaz, who were semi-nomadic and warlike. These qualities allowed these Chichimecas to resist Spanish domination for many years. However, the deterioration of the environment by the Spanish depleted resources for these people and finally made them submit.

The Chichimeca Jonaz refer to themselves and other indigenous as &quot;uza&quot; (singular) or &quot;ézar&quot; (plural), which roughly translates to &quot;Indian&quot;. Their language is Oto-Pamean and related to their neighbors, the Otomi. Most Chichimecas are found in the municipality of San Luis de la Paz, in the community of Rancho Uza or Mision Chichimeca. This community subdivides into the Mision de Abajo in the east and Mision de Arriba in the west. This area borders lands of the Huasteca and Pame groups, and there have been conflicts among the three. The Chichimeca Jonaz have a mixed Catholic-indigenous belief system. While outwardly Catholic, many rituals still follow the cycles found in nature, such as planting and harvesting and lunar cycles. The most important &quot;spirit guides&quot; are the eagle and water, with the Virgin of Guadalupe playing an important role as Universal Mother. One important saint is Isidore the Laborer, who is connected to the bringing of rain.

The Otomis of the state are concentrated in the community of Cieneguilla in the municipality of Tierra Blanca. In pre-Hispanic times, these people were semi-nomadic, desert dwellers. During the Conquest, these and other Otomi groups allied themselves with the Spanish, in part because the Aztecs and others considered the Otomi to be backwards and barbaric. The Otomi also speak an Oto-Pamean language and are related to other Otomi groups scattered around the central and southern areas of Mexico. Today, however, most children are not learning the language from their parents, putting it in danger of extinction in spite of efforts to introduce bilingual education.

===Immigration===

Concentrating in San Miguel de Allende, foreign residents from the United States and Canada came, in the early 2000s, because of the area&#x27;s mild climate, cultural opportunities, and low crime rate. While accounting for only about ten percent of San Miguel&#x27;s total population, they had a large impact on the area economically, accounting for most home buyers. Estimates of foreign residents range from 8,000 to 12,000 with about 7,000 of these from the United States alone. This makes San Miguel one of the largest American communities in Mexico, large enough to warrant its own U.S. consulate to provide services such as notary and passport.
Since that time, Guanajuato has had a significant rise in violent crime, the second highest homicide rate in the nation, with Mexican President López Obrador calling out the state&#x27;s attorney general for inaction on the matter.

There is a growing presence of East Asians, primarily Japanese, in the Bajio region. As of early 2014, there were more than three thousand Japanese immigrants in the Bajio area, and it&#x27;s claimed that this population is larger than the historical Japanese community in Mexico City. The Guanajuato government believes that by 2016 there will be five thousand families installed in the region. This immigration is being driven by foreign investment in the Bajio, especially in the automotive sector. The large Japanese community prompted the opening of a Japanese consulate in Leon. There is also a Korean community in the area that is likewise growing as a result of foreign investment.

==Economy==
Being located in the center of the country has important economic implications for the state, as a number of major national highways and railways pass through. The state is also a center of industry with most of the state&#x27;s major cities and economy located in the La Sierra Central and El Bajío regions. It has equal access to both the Pacific Ocean and Gulf of Mexico as well as the major metropolitan areas of Monterrey, Mexico City and Guadalajara. In 2008, the total GDP for the state was US$38,204,000,000 (427,503,000,000 MXN) or 3.88% of the total for the country. From 2003 to 2008, the economy grew 1.06% (adjusted for inflation). The state has the sixth-largest economy in Mexico behind Mexico City, the State of Mexico, Nuevo León, Jalisco, and Veracruz. As of 2008, Guanajuato ranks fourth in per capita income at US$7,609, behind Mexico City, Nuevo León and Jalisco, with a rate of increase of 2.04%. Manufacturing accounts for 28% of total GDP, down slightly from a high of over 30%. Its importance is followed by commerce at 16.3% and real estate at 11.2%. Agriculture, which includes forestry, fishing and hunting accounts for 4.6. Other activities include financial and other professional services (17.6%) and transportation and storage at 11.8%. Employment figures break down differently with 13.2% employed in agriculture, 36.4% in mining and industry and 47.3 percent in commerce, services and tourism. There are two significant migration patterns in the state. Twenty-seven of 46 municipalities have a high level of migration out to other areas, with 19 having a moderate to low level of the same. The annual rate of migration to the United States is 7.07 people per thousand.

===Industry, crafts and mining===
Industry is the most important segment in the modern state economy, accounting for about 30%. Most of this is the production of automobiles and automobile parts, pharmaceuticals and other modern items. It also includes more traditional items such as processed foods (cheese, canned items and more) as well as shoes and other leather goods in León and a variety of crafts. The economy in this area continues to grow although there has been some drop in its percentage of GDP due to drop in prices for a number of manufactured products. The state has two large thermoelectrical plants in Salamanca and Celaya. Oil refining in Salamanca received raw material through pipelines from Poza Rica, Veracruz and from Tabasco.

One traditional industry is the making of shoes and other leather items, especially in León. This industry grew 50% from 2009 to 2010 in the number of enterprises dedicated to it. They now total 7,981 and employ 297,413 people directly and indirectly according to INEGI. In 2010, Volkswagen announced a new motor plant to be built in Silao. The project is projected to cost US$550 million and will employ 700 people making 330,000 motors per year starting in 2013. A spokesman for the company acknowledged that part of the reason to build the plant was the existence of a General Motors plant in the same area as well as the existence of the Parque Industrial Puerto Interior which offers access to different transportation modes. The Centro de Innovación (Innovation Center) of Microsoft was inaugurated in 2010 in León. This establishment is meant to support businesses and governments to form software and technology enterprises with the goal of starting fifty new businesses with ten to twenty employees each.

Almost all handcrafts (98%) are made in micro and small enterprises, most of which are family-owned. Almost all them, which mostly consist of glass, wrought iron, ceramic and wooden items, are exported to the United States (91%). However, craft items are under pressure from imitations from Central America and Asia. The crafts sector of industry is not considered a particularly active segment of the state&#x27;s population with no data as to the percentage of the state&#x27;s GDP it represents. Most crafts over time have become specialties of more or more municipalities.

Majolica pottery has been made in the state since colonial times after being introduced by the Spanish. Since then, areas have developed specialties in form and decoration, but techniques have not changed much for over 400 years. Most clay is extracted from the Dolores Hidalgo region and most is produced in Dolores Hidalgo, San Miguel de Allende and the city of Guanajuato. Another area noted for its work is Tarandacuaro, which makes high-fire ceramics. The two best-known workshops are Fabrica Javier Servin and Taller Checuan. The ceramics of this area have distinctive, very intricate, mostly geometric designs, which are painted on by hand. The municipality promotes the work through its Centro Turistico de Desarrollo de Tarandacuao.

Acámbaro is noted for its bread. One local bread specialty is the &quot;tallado&quot;, which has a base of egg and butter and can have fillings such as fig, coconut, raisins and chocolate. This bread is the result of recipes brought by the Franciscans, modified over time by the native indigenous potters’ community.

San Francisco del Rincón has had a tradition of making hats since the 18th century. Traditionally, the hats were made from palm fronds brought from the Michoacán coast area, but today many workshops and factories use synthetic fibers. In traditional workshops, the work is divided by sex, with women weaving the fibers together and men pressing it into shape, putting in the supports and other details. The quality of the hats made here has made them exportable.

In San Luis de la Paz and Coroneo, wool is worked into clothing, especially into coats, gloves, vests, scarves and other items for winter wear. Some of the workshops still work with large old weaving looms. In addition, there are workshops which make rugs, zarapes, and other items for the home. In Coroneo, the craft 100 years ago was practiced only by women. The most common item is still the zarape, which is decorated with figures such as horse heads and deer as well as fretwork on the edges. However, sweaters, capes, rebozos, bags and even wool shoes can also be found for sale. One other specialty is rugs woven on large looms.

Apaseo el Alto is known for its work in fine woods, which began with the workshop of Domingo Garcia sixty years ago. Since then, about 150 workshops have been established in the municipality, employing about 500 craftsmen. Items include sculptures such as religious figures and animals and utilitarian items such as utensils and furniture. Craftsmen first began working with a wood called &quot;patol&quot; and juniper, but today they work with various woods such as walnut, cedar, mahogany and &quot;Ceiba pentandra&quot; (the kapok).
Celaya is known in much of Mexico for its cajeta, a kind of spreadable caramel, often made with goat&#x27;s milk, sugar and cinnamon. The mixture can be eaten straight from a spoon or used in a variety of recipes. The best known outlet for cajeta in the city is Cajetas La Tradicional, which has been in business for over 70 years.

Metalworking can mostly be found in the communities of Guanajuato and Salamanca. Although the capital&#x27;s mines no longer produce large quantities of gold and silver, silver items are still made and sold in the city. Wrought iron work for doors, windows and railings are also a specialty in certain areas of the city. Oxidized bronze items are a specialty of Salamanca, producing mostly decorative items. Most of the items made in Guanajuato city are still done Baroque style and sold in the city center. Pénjamo is one of very few places outside of the state of Jalisco to produce tequila. It is the home of the Tequila Corralejo brand, which is still made on the now former hacienda of Corralejo. The installation gives tours and has a museum called the Museo del Vino y la Botellas (Museum of Spirits and Bottles). The museum contains a collection of about 3,000 bottles, almost all of which with their original contents. Nearby is the factory that makes the distinctive blue bottles of this brand.

Glass making was brought to Mexico during the early colonial period. Most items made in Guanajuato are single-colored items in blue, green, yellow and red. San Miguel de Allende has the best-known tradition where curiously shaped bottles, vases, glass sets and small cups for tequila are produced. Wax candles and other items are a specialty in Salamanca, where they are especially in demand during Holy Week. Comonfort is known for the making of molcajetes from volcanic stone, and San Miguel is known for figures and other items made from brass. Dolores Hidalgo is known for ice cream and ices, much of which is simply sold next to the parish church. Flavors include sapote, mango, honey, aloe, tequila and banana.

Mining, manufacturing and construction accounts for over 27% of the state&#x27;s GDP. Mining is a traditional economic activity for the state, with deposits making it one of the world&#x27;s richest areas in the past. However, in comparison gold and silver ores are mostly depleted today. Gold and silver ore is still mined with silver still the major ore produced, followed by gold, lead, copper, zinc and sulfur. Most employed in mining are still related to metals rather than non-metals. Other products being mined or being studied are mercury, tin, copper, lead, sand, fluorite, feldspar, lime, kaolin, and more.

===Agriculture===
While the agricultural sector, which includes crops, livestock, fishing and forestry activities, accounts for only 4.6% of Guanajuato&#x27;s current GDP, the sector is an important part of the state&#x27;s identity and is still a major producer of a number of items nationally. The state has 1.1 million hectares suitable for agriculture, over 36% of the state&#x27;s territory. Over of land is under cultivation, with the main crops being corn, sorghum, beans, wheat, barley and broccoli. Today, the Bajio is still one of the major grain producing regions in Mexico. Certain areas of the state have large orchards producing peaches, strawberries, cactus pear, avocado, grapes, apples, quince, walnuts, apricots and guava.

Livestock raising is an important economic activity and can be found in all parts of the state, with animals such cattle, pigs, goats, sheep and domestic fowl, with hectares dedicated to this activity. The Los Altos and Bajío are the state&#x27;s livestock producing regions, especially dairy cows. It is one of the most important dairy producing states in Mexico. By volume, most of the meat produced is from domestic fowl, with pork coming in second, followed by beef, goat and sheep. Guanajuato produces 25.4% of the goat meat in the country.

Only a very small percentage of the economy is based on fishing and forestry. Fishing is not a major economic activity as it is limited to the small rivers and lakes of the region. Of the two major lakes, one is shared with neighboring Michoacán state. Of the fish is that is caught or raised, most is carp, followed by mojarra. There are 150,000 hectares of forest in the state, which about half theoretically exploitable. However, forests in this state have been historically depleted with species such as holm oak, pine and oyamel in danger of extinction. The lack of forest cover has led to erosion and other environmental problems. Most forestry products come from pine and holm oak, with most being harvested in the area around the city of Guanajuato.

===Commerce, services and tourism===

About 95% of the state&#x27;s visitors are from Mexico, with the rest from other countries. Within the state, there are about seventy hotels ranked as four or five stars. The three main cities for tourism are the capital city of Guanajuato, San Miguel de Allende and Dolores Hidalgo. Guanajuato is visited for its colonial architecture and its role in Mexico&#x27;s history, especially during the War of Independence. Similarly, San Miguel has cultural and historical value. Both have been designated World Heritage Sites. Although not a World Heritage Site, Dolores Hidalgo is particularly important as the site as it is where Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla gave the cry called &quot;El Grito&quot; which began the War of Independence.

The state has set up tourist routes such as the Ruta de Independencia, Ruta de Aventura (Aventure Route), Ruta Arqueológica (Archeological Route), Ruta de los Conventos (Monastery Route) and Ruta Artesanal (Handcrafts Route). The Ruta de la Independencia or Independence Route comprises ten municipalities through which the insurgent army under Miguel Hidalgo passed. These include San Miguel de Allende, Dolores Hidalgo, Guanajuato, León, Irapuato, Pénjamo, Salamanca, Celaya, Salvatierra and Acámbaro. In preparation for the Bicentennial of Mexico&#x27;s independence, the state rehabilitated and marked the sites in which the significant historic events occurred in each of these locations.

The Ruta de Aventura connects ghost towns and abandoned mines with natural areas for hiking, mountain biking and ATV as well as other extreme sports such as paragliding. One of the ghost towns is Mineral de Pozos in the northeast of the state. The town still has its cobblestone streets with names such as Relámpago (lightning), Estrellas (stars) and Flores (Flowers). The houses here are abandoned, many in ruins and none with roofs. The town reached its height during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when it was called Ciudad Porfirio Díaz, but the mines later gave out and the population left. In 1982, the town was declared a Historic Monument Zone. Although no one lives there, tourism keeps a few businesses alive around the main square such as the Pozos cantina, which exhibits photographs and other memorabilia on its walls. Outside the town is the Santa Brigida mine which sustained the town until it gave out. It is marked by three large ovens with tall pyramid roofs. These were constructed by the Jesuits to work ore from the mine. The Ruta Arqueológica (Archeological Route) links the two pre-Hispanic sites of Plazuelas and Peralta which are currently open to visitors with two others which are scheduled to be opened sometime in the future: La Virgen de la Cañada in San Miguel de Allende and El Cóporo in Ocampo.

The Ruta de los Conventos or Monastery Route is concentrated in the south of the state, where a number of large religious complexes were built in the early colonial period for evangelization purposes. The Agustino de San Pablo Church and Monastery is located in Yuriria founded by the Augustinians who arrived from Michoacán in the 16th century. It is a monumental fortress-like construction designed by Friar Diego de Chávez y Alvarado and Pedro del Toro and constructed in an area with relatively little population. The monastery became a center from which missionaries would be trained and then sent forth and its size and battlements helped to protect it from Chichimeca attacks. The church retains its original function and Plateresque facade, but the monastery area has been converted into a museum. The Las Capucinas Church and Convent is in Salvatierra and is one of only three complexes built for nuns in the entire state during the colonial period. It has a fortress like appearance and its construction is attributed to Joaquin de Heredia, of the San Carlos Academy. During the Porfirio Díaz presidency, the convent was used as a Civil Hospital and later as a school, which still remains with the name of Colegio José María Morelos. The San Francisco Church and Monastery is in Acámbaro and built between 1734 and 1743. Its facade is Baroque of light pink stone. Inside, the church contains one of the most notable main altars in the Bajio region. It is Neoclassical built of gray and pink stone with gilded details, with an image of the Virgen María Refugio de Pecadores (Virgin Mary Refuge of Sinners), which is replica of an image in Zacatecas.

The Ruta Artesanal (Handcrafts Route) connects a number of municipalities which specialize in one or more handcrafted items, including food. These include Acámbaro, noted for its bread, Coroneo for its wool items and Tarancuaro for ceramics.

The state also has a large number of water parks and thermal springs converted into water parks. Some of these include El Trébol, Villa Gasco and Comanjilla near León, Caldera Abasolo near Irapuato and Abasolo and Los Arcos and Agua Caliente near Celaya.
==Culture==

===Festivals===

Culturally, the state is best known for the annual Festival Internacional Cervantino, which takes place in the city of Guanajuato and some other affiliated venues in the state. The event sponsors a large number of artistic and cultural events with artists invited from Mexico and other parts of the world. The festival hosts events such as opera, theater productions, film showings, art exhibitions, academic conferences and talks, concerts and dance recitals. The performances occur in 70 different venues over most of the month of October. In addition to the major events in venues, artists such as dancers, clowns and more, give small and sometimes impromptu shows on the streets, sidewalks and small plazas that are located in the city. Because of this, the event brings many visitors to the city who wander the streets, visiting the many sights of the city. During the event, hotel occupancy rates are as high as 98%. In 2010, invited artists included the Da Motus! Swiss dance company. The event is named in honor of Miguel de Cervantes, author of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. The festival began in 1972, as short plays performed by University of Guanajuato students based on the works of Cervantes. In 2010, special guests included the state of Querétaro and the country of Colombia. The 2010 edition of the festival included performers such as Tangokineses from Argentina, Cumbia Cienaguera from Colombia. In total, there were 424 events over 26 days.

A parallel event is the Festival International Cervantino Callejero which is sponsored by an organization called the Centro Libre de Experimentacion Teatral y Artistica (CLETA). In 2010, this event had 300 performances with social themes. This annual event was begun in 1975, in part inspired by the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Abbey Road&quot; album cover. The Festival Internacional de Cine en Corto began in 1997 and today is one of the most important cinematographic events in the country. It was established in Guanajuato in an effort to decentralize cultural events away from Mexico City. Most events associated with the festival take place in the city of Guanajuato and San Miguel Allende and awards prizes in various categories including commercials. The showing of films is sometimes in unusual locations such as one of Guanajuato&#x27;s tunnels under the city or in the municipal cemetery at midnight.

===Cuisine===

Many of the dishes that are traditionally eaten in Guanajuato are regional variations of dishes known in other parts such as carnitas, tamales, birria and pozole. A version of the enchilada is called the &quot;enchilada minera&quot; (miners’ enchilada), which is a tortilla fried in lard and then filled with chicken and covered with a sauce made with guajillo chili peppers, a ranchero cheese and chopped potatoes and carrots. Recently, there has been a movement to update many of these dishes, keeping to traditional ingredients, called &quot;Guanajuato fusion&quot;. This is most popular in upscale restaurants in San Miguel de Allende and Guanajuato and can include dishes such as tuna with chili peppers and duck with mesquite honey.

The state is better known as the producer of a number of food products such as cajeta, bread, candy, and ice cream. The best-known food product is &quot;cajeta&quot;, a soft, spreadable sweet product made with goat&#x27;s milk, sugar, and flavorings. The best known place for this is Celaya. The cajeta can be flavored with vanilla, coconut, strawberry, and others; it is eaten with a spoon from the container, spread on bread, or made into candies. Another typical sweet in the state is called charamuscas. It is made with piloncillo, which is melted to form shapes. In the city of Guanajuato, one can find charamuscas in the shape of mummies. Alfeñique refers to glass sugar based candies used to form figures and is most popular for Day of the Dead. Chilacayote is a candy made from a type of melon of the same name, which is prepared by soaking pieces of the fruit in sugar solution. Handmade ice cream is a specialty of Dolores Hidalgo, made with all natural ingredients, often using recipes passed down for generations. While ice cream and ices are made in other parts of the state, these stand out because of the many unusual flavors offered such as beer, pulque, chile relleno, even shrimp and mole. The Franciscans taught the indigenous how to work with wheat and bake bread. Because there had already been a tradition of kneading clay for pottery, the kneading and baking of wheat bread became established quickly, adapting the original recipes to local tastes. The best known breads are those from Acámbaro, especially the type called &quot;pan grande&quot;. Other well-known types are pan ranchero, tallado, pan huevo and pan leche. The first indigenous master baker in Guanajuato was Abraham de Silva Cuín, who, in 1526, began to make breads in unique forms and flavors.

===Architecture===
Most of the state&#x27;s architecturally significant buildings are in Mexican Baroque style, especially in the capital city. This was because the mines of the state were at maximum production during the 18th century, when this style was fashionable. It can be found in mansions and civil buildings of that time but the most ornate examples are churches, with intricate facades and altarpieces both which often use the &quot;estipite&quot; column (inverted, truncated pyramid). A number of Baroque altarpieces from this time are also gilded with gold from local mines. Within the city of Guanajuato, the most notable examples are the San Cayetano or La Valenciana Church, the Basilica of Guanajuato, the Temple of the Company of Jesus and the San Roque Church. Outside the capital, notable examples include the Parish of Nuestra Señora de los Dolores, the La Tercera Orden Temple and the Casa de Visitas in Dolores Hidalgo, the San Francisco Church and Monastery and the San Agustin Church in Celaya, and the Basilica Cathedral and the Nuestra Señora de los Angeles Church in León. There are some examples were the Baroque also contains indigenous elements such as the San José Church in Irapuato and the San Agustin Monastery and Church in Yuriria. At the beginning of the 19th century, Baroque was giving way to Neoclassical. The Mexican War of Independence ended most major constructions, but in many churches in the state, Baroque altarpieces were replaced with Neoclassical ones. A few Neoclassical constructions did manage to be built, mostly by Francisco Eduardo Tresguerras and include the obelisk monument to Charles IV of Spain, the Del Carmen Church, The San Agustin Tower and the Dolores Chapel. Neoclassical works by others include the Entrance Arch of León, the Teatro Principal in Guanajuato and the Santiago Apostól Parish in Silao. From the 19th century on, trends became more modern with one notable exception. The Parish of San Miguel in San Miguel Allende had its facade redone by self-taught architect Zeferino Gutierrez. Working from only images from postcards of Gothic cathedrals in Europe, Gutierrez created the imposing Gothic-like front, which is unique in the state.

The uniqueness of the state of Guanajuato even led Disney&#x27;s Coco team to be inspired by the city. The colorful buildings all over Mexico gave the animators inspiration to bring the culture and heritage to the film. 

===Arts and literature===
Guanajuato is home or place of origin of three important painters: Diego Rivera, José Chávez Morado and Olga Costa. Rivera was born in the city of Guanajuato and spent his early childhood there. When he was older, he moved to Mexico City to study painting and eventually became one of Mexico&#x27;s most famous muralists. José Chávez Morado was a prolific painter who lived and worked in the city of Guanajuato. He initially worked with José Clemente Orozco, who impressed him both with art as well as politics. Chávez Morado&#x27;s most prolific period was between 1955 and 1967, when he realized works in the Ciudad Universitaria in Mexico City, the Secretariat of Communications and Transportation building in Mexico City and the Alhóndiga de Granaditas in his hometown. Olga Costa&#x27;s real last name was Kostakowsky, but it was Hispanicized to Costa. She was born in Leipzig, Germany but she and her family moved to Mexico when she was very young. She was friends with and contemporaries of Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo, Rufino Tamayo and Carlos Mérida, as well as wife to José Chávez Morado. She is best known for founding the Galería Espiral and co-founder of the Sociedad de Arte Moderno and the Salon de Plastica Mexicana. Her best known work is titled &quot;Vendedora de Frutas&quot;.
Other artists include Manuel Leal, whose works are mostly scenes from the state, Romualdo Garcia, better known as a photographer than painter, Hermenegildo Bustos, Hilario Gómez Sánchez and Luis Ferro Márquez. The state also produced one well-known sculptor by the name of Tomás Chávez Morado, brother of José. His works can be seen at the Museo Regional de la Alhóndiga de Granaditas and the Museo del Caracol in Mexico City.

Guanajuato&#x27;s three main literary figures are Jorge Ibargüengoitia, Juan Ibáñez and Efraín Huerta. Ibargüengoitia was one of Mexico&#x27;s most important writers of the 20th century, noted for his satirical works with social themes. Examples of his work include Los relámpagos de agosto, Los pasos de Lopez and Estas ruinas que ves. Ibáñez was a dramatist who was active in the second half of the 20th century. His best known work is Los caifanes, produced as a movie in 1966. Huerta began as a journalist and movie critic but his fame came as a poet. Some of his works include Absoluto amor, Línea del alba, Poemas de guerra y esperanza, and La rosa primitiva.

==Government and politics==

Politically the state is divided into eight regions: Region I North/Dolores Hidalgo, Region II North-East/San Luis de la Paz, Region III/León, Region IV Center-West/Guanajuato, Region V East/Celaya, Region VI South-West/Irapuato, Region VII Center-South/Salamanca and Region VIII/South-East/Acambaro. It is also divided into 46 municipalities for local government purposes. The municipalities are grouped into 15 political regions for elections.

The state government is headed by an elected governor who controls the executive branch of government. The governor has one six-year term with no reelection. The governor is required to report on the state of the government each year on August 1. This branch contains a large number of secretariats and other offices related to social issues, economic issues, education, law and administration. The legislative branch is unicameral with 36 elected representatives. Elections for congress occur every three years. This branch has various commissions related to legal, municipal and economic issues. The judicial branch consists of various levels of courts as well as the attorneys general offices. They are all presided over by a &quot;presidencia&quot;.

==Education==

Guanajuato ranks seventh in the country in the number of schools per capita and sixth in teacher-student ratio. The state has over 4,000 preschools, 4,600 primary schools, about 1400 middle schools, about 650 high schools, 73 teachers’ colleges, 125 institutions offering bachelor&#x27;s degrees and 60 offering advanced degrees. 12.1% of the population over 15 is illiterate according to the 2005 census.

About half of the state&#x27;s municipalities have one or more institutions of higher education, with the most important being the University of Guanajuato. This university is in the city of Guanajuato, and began as a Jesuit school for children in the first half of the 18th century. The establishment of this school was sponsored by Josefa Teresa de Busto y Moya, sister of the Marquis of San Clemente, who obtained permission for the school from the Spanish Crown in 1732 and established the institution in her home. She donated a fifth of her fortune to it and worked to obtain donations from other wealthy families in the city. Over time, the school grew and began to offer high school and professional level studies. It had several names over its history, from Real Colegio de la Purísima Concepción (1767), Colegio del Estado (1828), and Colegio Nacional de Guanajuato (1867) to its current name, adopted in 1945. The name &quot;Colegio del Estado&quot; was prompted by the fact that the institution became property of the state in 1828. In 1945, it gained university status.

Today the institution serves approximately 30,000 students at the high school, bachelor&#x27;s and graduate levels. In addition to the main campus in the city, there are nine others in other parts of Guanajuato state. The university hosts a number of the events of the Festival Cervantino, with its famous stairway acting as seating. The institution&#x27;s best-known facility is the main building in Guanajuato city, which was built in Neoclassical style in green stone. It houses the Dean&#x27;s office, administrative offices and a number of the institution&#x27;s departments. The main building is recognizable by its long staircase with 113 steps, which empties onto the Callejon del Estudiante. Under the main roof is a 16th-century chapel that was sponsored by Vasco de Quiroga for indigenous mine workers, the Templo de los Hospitales (Temple of the Hospitals). It is also the place that received the image of the Virgin of the Rosary, now called the Nuestra Señora de Guanajuato.

Other institutions include Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (ITESM) campus León and Irapuato, Universidad de León (UDL), Politécnico de Guanajuato, Universidad De La Salle Bajío, Universidad Iberoamericana, Universidad Santa Fe, Universidad de Celaya, Universidad Quetzalcóatl, Universidad Pedagógica Nacional (UPN), Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN) Unidad Profesional Interdisciplinaria de Ingeniería (UPIIUG).

Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) has begun to build a campus in the city of León to serve 15,000 students in the west of Mexico. The project will be built on a 60-hectare site in the south of the city to serve students in Guanajuato, Jalisco, Aguascalientes, Querétaro, San Luis Potosí, Michoacán and Zacatecas, starting in 2011. The first major to be offered is orthodontics, which is not offered by any other school in the region and will be followed by 11 others. Guanajuato also has the research centers CIMAT, CINVESTAV, CRODE, CIATEC, CIO, CICSUG, CIQI, IIBE, IIEDUG, IIC, IIM, INIFAP, and the laboratories CFE LAPEM and LANGEBIO.

==Media==
Newspapers of Guanajuato include: &quot;a. m. de Guanajuato&quot;, &quot;a. m. de Irapuato&quot;, &quot;a. m. de San Francisco del Rincón&quot;, &quot;a. m. el periódico libre de Celaya&quot;, &quot;Al Día&quot;, &quot;El Heraldo de León&quot;, &quot;El Sol de Irapuato&quot;, &quot;El Sol de Salamanca&quot;, &quot;El Sol del Bajío&quot;, &quot;Esto del Bajío&quot;, &quot;La Prensa del Bajío&quot;, &quot;Milenio León&quot;, &quot;Noticias Vespertinas&quot;, &quot;Periódico AM, líder en noticias de León&quot;, and &quot;Periódico Correo.&quot;

==Transportation==

Guanajuato&#x27;s highways directly connect to three of Mexico&#x27;s ten major highways (Mexico City-Nuevo Laredo, Querétaro-Ciudad Juárez and Manzanillo-Tampico). The state has 11,061 km of highway, 5,281 km of which are rural. It also has 1,249 km of federal highways and 2,462 of state highways. In July 2010, the state government of Guanajuato in Mexico awarded the 30-year concession of
the US$122 million Libramiento de Celaya toll road to consortium Concesionaria Bicentenario. The consortium will be responsible for constructing, operating and maintaining two highway sections. Work on the 12.9 km Libramiento Nororiente stretch was scheduled to start in September 2010 and on the 16.5 km Libramiento Sur stretch on August 9, 2010.

Like in the rest of Mexico, rail lines are almost exclusively used for the transportation of freight in the industrial areas of the state and, like the highway system, connects to most of the major national lines, with a total of 1,085 km in the state. The most important line is the Empalme Escobedo in the municipalities of Comonfort, Acámbaro and Irapuato. In Celaya, there is a &quot;ferropuerto&quot; (rail-port), an installation on 57 hectares used to transfer 1 million tons of freight each year. The facility has customs and other offices to facilitates international shipments.

The Guanajuato International Airport, formerly the Bajío International Airport is located in the municipality of Silao between the cities of Silao and León. The airport currently serves ten airlines and serves many domestic and international destinations. There is one other airport in Celaya which serves domestic destinations as well as airfields in San Miguel Allende, Doctor Mora, Irapuato, Manuel Doblado and San Francisco del Rincón.

==Archeological sites==

Chupícuaro is a site located in the south of the state on one side of the Lerma River. It is one of the older sites of Mesoamerica, having been active from 800 BCE to 300 CE and shows some of the earliest evidence of agriculture. The site has low flat rectangular platforms, with evidence of earlier structures below, which were probably the foundation of multigenerational houses; however most of the site is now under the waters of the Solís Dam. This site, along with some nearby contemporary sites, is known for its pottery called &quot;Blanco Levantado&quot;, characterized with red and other colored lines on a light or cream background. This pottery has been shown to have elements in common with pottery in Zacatecas, other areas in northwest Mexico and even that of the Hohokam in Arizona and researchers believe that these people had trade relations that far north even finding turquoise. While the site has been extensively studied, it has also suffered looting, including some at the hands of Guanajuato authorities.

Tierra Blanca is a large site which was a true city, not a ceremonial site, but most of the site had been sacked and practically destroyed when it fell and later as an archeological site although early photographs of it remain. There is evidence in Tula that this city, or one like it, had had significant influence on the Tula civilization. For this reason, the time span for Tierra Blanca is placed at before 950 CE although there is little evidence at the site itself to date it.

Carabino is located in the northeast of the state. At this site items from and influenced by the city of Tula are found dating the city to about 900 to 1150 CE. There is some evidence to suggest that the city was a colony of one of the cities of the center of Mexico. In Villa de Reyes in the far north in the Valley of San Luis, there also evidence of Toltec presence or influence. However, this later site was occupied first between 550 and 710 CE, then again in the Toltec era 200 to 300 years later. Evidence suggests that groups in these parts of Guanajuato had an effect on the organization of the Toltec Empire as settlements were abandoned sometime between 600 and 900 CE. Through the Toltecs&#x27; influence in the Valley of Mexico, Guanajuato cultures eventually had some influence on the much later Aztec.
Plazuelas is located just west of Pénjamo in the foothills of the Sierra de Pénjamo. The site, which is noted for the complexity of its architecture, was occupied during the first millennium of the Common Era with its height at around 600 to 900 CE. The site was constructed over three hillsides separated by two large arroyos called Los Cuijes and Agua Nacida. The ethnicity of its occupants is not known nor is its original name. It appears to have been a theocracy with the elite inhabiting the hillsides and the rest of the population on flatter lands below. The most important construction at the site is the complex called Casas Tapadas, which contains several large structures and one Mesoamerican ball court.

Peralta is located on Abasolo, 21 km from Pénjamo. It developed between 300 and 700 CE, at the time that Teotihuacan was declining and Tula was rising. According to archeologists, the city declined and collapsed due to the overexploitation of the surrounding deciduous rainforest and it was abandoned around 900 CE. The site occupies 150 hectares divided into a center with five surrounding settlements. The most important structure is called the &quot;Patio Hundido&quot; (Sunken Patio), whose name comes from the four pyramids that are at the corners. Another important building is the La Mesita (The Small Table) or Recinto de los Gobernantes (Governors&#x27; Precinct). It has a large plaza which is considered to have been the main square for the city. Among the walls and other structures a semicircle dedicated to the Danza de Voladores has been discovered.

Cañada de la Virgen contains a number of closely related architectonic complexes. Complex A, also called the Casa de los Trece Cielos (House of the Thirteen Heavens or Skies), consists of a large &quot;sunken&quot; patio like that in Peralta surrounded a pyramidal base over 25 meters high and platforms that enclose the west, north and south sides. El Cóporo is situated on a small mountain and probably used by a group related to the Toltecs. It was at its height between 500 and 600 CE. but abandoned by 900 CE. It is a ceremonial center constructed of adobe and earth. One unique aspect of its construction is a series of columns which sink into the earth to a depth of about two and a half meters.
Other archeological sites in the state include Morales in San Miguel and El Cóporo in the northwest. The latter has figurines that show influence from groups in Zacatecas.

<text>Classical Pantheism, as defined by Charles Hartshorne in 1953, is the theological deterministic philosophies of pantheists such as Baruch Spinoza and the Stoics. Hartshorne sought to distinguish panentheism, which rejects determinism, from deterministic pantheism.

The term has also been used to mean Pantheism in the classical Greek and Roman era, or archetypal pantheism as variously defined by different authors.

== Hartshorne&#x27;s Classical Pantheism ==

This usage of the term Classical Pantheism was first presented by Charles Hartshorne in 1953, and by others discussing his presentation. In making his case for panentheism, Hartshorne sought to distinguish panentheism, which rejects determinism, from deterministic pantheism.

The term &quot;pantheism&quot; is derived from Greek words pan (πᾶν, &quot;all&quot;) and theos (θεός, &quot;God&quot;), together meaning &quot;All-God&quot; or &quot;All is God.&quot; It is often associated with monism, the view that reality is a single thing.

The &quot;Encyclopedia of Religion&quot; refers to this form of Pantheism as an &quot;extreme monism,&quot; stating that in Classical Pantheism, &quot;God decides or determines everything, including our supposed decisions.&quot; Other examples of deterministic-inclined pantheisms include the views of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Ernst Haeckel, and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.

== Quotations ==
The following quotations illustrate Hartshorne&#x27;s concept of Classical Pantheism:

*&quot;For no particular thing, not even the smallest, can have happened otherwise than in accordance with the common nature and its reason.&quot; - Chrysippus
*&quot;In the mind there is no absolute or free will; but the mind is determined to wish this or that by a cause, which has also been determined by another cause, and this last by another cause, and so on to infinity.&quot; - Baruch Spinoza

== Other uses of &quot;Classical Pantheism&quot; ==
*Typical or archetypal pantheism. This usage varies according to the judgement of the writer as to what constitutes typical or archetypal pantheism, but usually includes Spinoza.
*Pantheism of the Classical period, specifically Ancient Greece and Rome (for example, Stoicism).

<doc id="412841" wikidata="Q909557" url="?curid=412841" title="My Family">
<text>My Family is a British sitcom created and initially co-written by Fred Barron, which was produced by DLT Entertainment and Rude Boy Productions, and broadcast by BBC One for eleven series between 2000 and 2011, with Christmas specials broadcast from 2002 onwards. &quot;My Family&quot; was voted 24th in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom&quot; in 2004 and was the most watched sitcom in the United Kingdom in 2008. As of 2011, it is one of only twelve British sitcoms to pass the 100-episode mark. In April 2020, BBC One began airing the series from the first episode in an 8 pm slot on Friday nights; along with this all 11 series were made available on BBC iPlayer.

The show chronicles the lives of the Harpers, a fictional middle-class British family. Set in Chiswick in west London, it stars Robert Lindsay and Zoë Wanamaker as husband and wife Ben and Susan Harper, with Kris Marshall, Daniela Denby-Ashe and Gabriel Thomson as their children Nick, Janey and Michael.

==Background==
In 1999, Fred Barron was considering producing a British sitcom the same way sitcoms were produced in the U.S. &quot;My Family&quot; was to feature a group of writers in a writers&#x27; room rather than the standard one or two, something that had been attempted in the UK with shows including &quot;Goodnight Sweetheart&quot; and &quot;On the Buses&quot;, but was nevertheless atypical. &quot;My Family&quot; was consciously designed to have wide appeal, featuring characters with whom viewers could build relationships similar to the earlier BBC sitcom &quot;2point4 Children&quot; which was also concentrated around a family unit.

The show chronicles the lives of the Harpers, a fictional middle-class British family who live at 78 Lancaster Road, Chiswick, London. Dentist Ben and his wife Susan, a tour guide who later works for an art gallery, have three children: Nick, Janey, and Michael, who endanger their lives. Susan is a control freak, but Ben prefers to leave the children to it and stay as uninvolved as possible. Janey later goes to University, but drops out and moves back in later, while Nick finally gets his own place.

Mainly focusing on Ben and Susan, the show featured sub-stories ranging from Nick&#x27;s schemes to Abi and Roger&#x27;s love life. It is described as a &quot;dysfunctional family&quot;-style sitcom; however, many of the episodes feature the family working together to get one another out of trouble. Nick&#x27;s bizarre jobs became a major feature of the first four series. After the departure of Nick, more prominence was given to Abi and Roger&#x27;s love life, Michael&#x27;s misadventures, Janey&#x27;s endless list of boyfriends, and Alfie&#x27;s dream of musical stardom.

The show saw considerable development and change in its characters&#x27; lives, seeing Janey turn from teenage rebel to loving mother, Nick turn from slacker to a mature adult, Abi marry Roger, and Michael go through and beyond his school days. Meanwhile, Ben remained the same grumpy dentist, Susan remained the same control freak, and Alfie remained the same slow-witted lodger.

==Cast and characters==
The main characters in &quot;My Family&quot; are parents Ben and Susan Harper. They have three children, Nick, Janey and Michael. Nick is a regular character until the 2003 Christmas special, and makes one appearance in 2004&#x27;s fifth series before making his final &quot;My Family&quot; appearance in the 2005 Comic Relief short as actor Kris Marshall wanted to do other projects and avoid being type-cast. Janey is a regular until the 2002 Christmas special and does not appear in series four (2003), while the character is at university. Janey returns as a main character in series five.

Abi Harper first appears in series three as the daughter of Ben&#x27;s cousin Richard. Series three also sees the first appearance of Roger Bailey, Jnr. Roger, who becomes a main character in the fourth series, is a dentist and the son of Ben&#x27;s former mentor. In the 2005 Christmas special Alfie Butts, a friend of Nick&#x27;s, moves into the Harper household.

&quot;My Family&quot; features several recurring characters. Series one features Daisy Donovan as Ben&#x27;s dental assistant, Brigitte. In the second series &quot;Stupid&quot; Brian appears as Janey&#x27;s boyfriend. Series four features Michael&#x27;s girlfriend Fiona. That series also sees the introduction of Michael&#x27;s friend Hubert and Susan&#x27;s mother Grace Riggs, who both appear in subsequent series until series seven. A minor recurring character from the 2006 Christmas special to series seven is Denis, the local Vicar. In addition, Mr. Alexander Casey, the Harpers&#x27; neighbour, appears in three episodes, &quot;Driving Miss Crazy&quot; (2001), &quot;Neighbour Wars&quot; (2008), and &quot;Mary Christmas&quot; (2010)

===Overview===
===Main characters===
*Robert Lindsay (2000–11) portrays Ben Harper. Ben Harper is an overly-misanthropic and cynical dentist. When he is not at work sacking another assistant or trying to avoid fellow-dentist Roger, he is at home trying to relax (which never works). Ben isn&#x27;t a bad man; behind his sardonic exterior he does really love his family and has to put up with being bossed about and manipulated by his wife Susan and continually fleeced for money by his children. Ben also hates Christmas, which is never explained.
*Zoë Wanamaker (2000–11) portrays Susan Harper. Susan Harper is a control freak and very good at getting her way. She is constantly worried about her three children and often forces Ben to go out of his way to monitor or look after them. Susan is a tour guide but seems to spend most of her time at home. She is a terrible cook. This is a homage to &quot;Butterflies&quot;, in which the male lead is also a dentist called Ben and the rest of the family often have to sneak the food she has prepared into the bin without her noticing.
*Kris Marshall (2000–05) portrays Nick Harper. Nick Harper is the oldest sibling. He is a layabout who is constantly changing jobs – a self-employed stuntman one minute, a gorilla-o-gram the next, at one point a sperm-donor. Extremely laid-back, Nick cannot be trusted to look after money or handle important tasks. He was last seen moving into his own flat, and from phone conversations Ben and Susan have with him, he seems to be coping with living on his own.
*Daniela Denby-Ashe (2000–02; 2004–11) portrays Janey Harper. Fashion-conscious, money-loving, boy-mad Janey spends all her time on the phone, switching boyfriends, or pestering Ben for shopping money. Whilst at Manchester University (spending yet more of her dad&#x27;s money) Janey got pregnant. She was expelled and returned home to once again take advantage of her parents. Susan does not seem to mind, as it means she now has Kenzo Harper to look after.
*Gabriel Thomson (2000–11) portrays Michael Harper. Michael (or &quot;Mikey&quot; as Ben calls him) is Susan and Ben&#x27;s youngest, a smart, geeky adolescent. He looks down on his family, thinking he is more sensible than the rest of them put together, and often ends up getting them out of trouble. Since starting university he has experimented with bleached hair and piercings. In series 10 Michael comes out and tells his family that he is gay; he is relieved when they accept this.
*Siobhan Hayes (2002–08) portrays Abi Harper. Abi moved into the Harper household in the third series. She is Ben&#x27;s first cousin once removed, very clumsy and very dim, and often seen telling off Ben or Susan. When she finally realized that Roger was madly in love with her, they married in series seven, but she later left him to become a nun.
*Keiron Self (2002–11) portrays Roger Bailey. Roger is the over-enthusiastic dentist who works in the same building as Ben. He often turns up at the Harper household uninvited and proceeds to unintentionally annoy Ben. For a long period Roger was trying to build up the courage to ask Abi out. They were, after all, ideally suited – like Abi, Roger possesses no common sense and is gullible. Eventually they did marry but have since split as Abi has decided to become a nun. He&#x27;s now a part-time policeman as well a dentist.
*Rhodri Meilir (2005–09) portrays Alfie Butts. Alfie is a friend of Nick&#x27;s who turned up at the Harper household at Christmas 2005. Alfie comes from a small community in Wales which, based on his stories, has some rather backwards traditions. Also, there weren&#x27;t many girls where he came from, so he savors spending time at the Harpers&#x27; and meeting Michael&#x27;s friends. Most of the family have turned to him at various times for advice. He&#x27;s a struggling musician who is very laid-back about life despite not having a home or a steady income. He did not appear in the 2009 Christmas special and was completely absent from the whole of series 10 and 11, with no explanation.
*Tayler Marshall (2006–11; character introduced in 2003) portrays Kenzo Harper. Kenzo is the youngest member of the Harper household, son of Janey, grandson of Ben and Susan and nephew of Michael and Nick. Even at such a young age, he&#x27;s shown a massive intelligence which at times even rivals, and at times even beats, Michael&#x27;s. At the end of series nine, he has done a project about his family and he tells them his teachers want him to see a psychologist. As portrayed by Tayler Marshall, Kenzo bears a striking resemblance to his uncle Nick (Kris Marshall). Before becoming Kenzo in 2006, Tayler Marshall portrayed a guest at Kenzo&#x27;s third-birthday party in 2005.

===Other characters===
*Daisy Donovan portrays Brigitte McKay, Ben Harper&#x27;s dental assistant for the entire first series. She was known for her unique way of thinking and living, and often tried to offer Ben and his patients spiritual guidance. She often forgot to take phone messages for Ben and irritated him while he worked. She and Nick appeared to be attracted to each other.
*Chloe Bale portrays Sasha, Janey&#x27;s best friend in series 8–11. Storylines focused on the pair getting into trouble (usually instigated by Sasha). She was disliked by Ben, then by Janey until they became friends again.
*Maxine an unseen character was Janey&#x27;s best friend from school. Although she was never seen, it was hinted that Maxine was very much like Janey: popular, and fashion-conscious. Janey once admitted to Susan that she hung out with Maxine because Maxine&#x27;s alleged &quot;ugliness&quot; made Janey look more beautiful. Janey was also jealous that Maxine&#x27;s parents treated her with expensive designer labels. It is unknown if they kept in touch.
*Rosemary Leach portrays Grace Riggs, Susan Harper&#x27;s mother, known for her addiction to alcohol, especially martinis. She and Susan have a cold relationship, and are locked in a constant psychological battle. Grace has had various boyfriends in the show and was the one who told Ben that Susan was married before she married him. She likes to make Susan feel guilty for not visiting her and often uses deceitful tactics to lure her over. Her own late mother, Mary, owned a highly-successful brothel in London&#x27;s West End. She first appeared in series two, played by Avril Elgar and credited as &quot;Rebecca&quot; (although she was not referred to by name in the episode). She did not reappear until Leach took up the role in series four. It was announced in the episode &quot;A Decent Proposal&quot; that she had died.
*Kevin Bishop portrays Stupid Brian, Janey&#x27;s boyfriend in the show&#x27;s second series when he and Janey were still at school but he was getting into decorating. Although he lived up to the nickname &#x27;Stupid Brian,&#x27; he was surprising apt at building a bookshelf for the Harpers&#x27; kitchen.
*Alex Dawson portrays Hubert, Michael&#x27;s best friend (it&#x27;s unknown whether they&#x27;re still in touch). Hubert was known for being very square but very smart. He once created a television remote that could gain &#x27;free&#x27; access channels that required PINs for them.
*Andy Taylor portrays Hotel Receptionist, appearing in five episodes. He appears in different hotels across the country as a hotel receptionist. Each time he encountered the Harper family he became more familiar with their dysfunctional antics. He once suspected that Susan was an escort and that Ben had a mistress.
*Nickolas Grace portrays Mr. Casey, the Harpers&#x27; next-door neighbour, although he doesn&#x27;t get along with them. Viewers first met him as a recent widower who had adopted a dog and named her Gemma. He also tried to scam Ben for money after Ben ran over this dog.
*Rachel Hyde-Harvey portrays Fiona, Michael&#x27;s girlfriend throughout the fourth series. She and Michael are caught in bed together but never had sex. They are also caught kissing in the airing cupboard, and in another scene they begin to take their clothes off but Susan is listening and says they should stop.
*Nathan Brine portrays Scott Marsh in series 10. Scott is Michael&#x27;s first boyfriend. In his first appearance, Ben accidentally outed him to his homophobic father and he was forced to leave home. Susan invited him to live at the house, but Michael and Scott moved into a new flat instead. A few episodes later, it was revealed that Scott and Michael had split up, although they got back together in the same episode.

==Episodes==

The first episode aired on 19 September 2000, with the final episode on 2 September 2011. 120 episodes, including ten specials, were broadcast as well as one Comic Relief short.

The BBC and UKTV refuse to re-broadcast the series four episode &quot;Blind Justice&quot;, due to the receipt of 4 complaints (from a viewing public of 12m). Although no reason was given, it is likely that was considered offensive to blind people. This episode is banned from British TV, but it is still on BBC iPlayer, the series four UK DVD release and has been screened on BBC America. However it is likely that the 2010 Christmas episode, &quot;Mary Christmas&quot;, will never be repeated on British TV or added to BBC iPlayer, as it features a guest appearance from Rolf Harris. However, it is still on the 5 Christmas Specials UK DVD release.

The episodes are recorded in front of a live audience in Pinewood Studios, Iver, Buckinghamshire, except where the set used is too large, this is then filmed, and played out to an invited audience &#x27;as-live&#x27;. Series 1 was recorded at BBC Television Centre in London. Also, the show, unlike most British sitcoms but in common with most American television comedies, has no location footage. Scenes taking place outdoors were actually sets.

The series was scripted by a team of writers, following the American model. Historically, British sitcoms were more generally written by one or two writers. By employing a wider number of writers to brainstorm jokes for each episode, DLT Entertainment UK Ltd, the production company, was able to maintain a consistent and relatively long-lived product without having to wait for a single writer to produce more material.

===Opening sequence===

At the start of the first two series, it slides across four boxes with each character&#x27;s face in them. The first box stands alone with Ben and Susan in it. The other three are lapped over each other with a photo of Michael, Janey and Nick from left to right in them. While it slides across at the start, each character&#x27;s face turns with Janey and Nick smiling and the others being fairly plain faced. Once the boxes are placed, the boxes with youngsters in them drop to the bottom of the screen and are replaced with the show&#x27;s logo.

At the start of the third series, four rectangle blocks fall onto a completely white screen to create Ben&#x27;s face. Those blocks are then replaced with blocks that create Susan&#x27;s face; each block then shows different parts of the other characters to finally reveal Nick&#x27;s face. It continues to do this for Janey, Michael and (starting from the fourth episode entitled &quot;Of Mice and Ben&quot;) the new character to the show Abi. Abi&#x27;s (for the first three episodes, Michael&#x27;s) face then falls into the bottom right corner while the previous faces spread across to other places of the white screen. It reveals that Nick, Janey and Michael are next to Abi and Ben and Susan are with each other at the top left of the screen. The logo fades on the top right of the screen.

The fourth series is similar to the third series opening sequence. Only difference is that the photo of each character is changed, each block does not show different parts of each character when it transitions; instead it transitions in various styles, for example in an opening in a window blind style. Series five titles still remain similar; the photos are changed again and there are eleven rectangles instead of four. Nick is almost completely absent from the opening titles in series five except in episode six of series five titled &quot;My Will Be Done&quot;; he was missing in some episodes from series four and a few from series three.

The series six opening titles have cut-outs of each character, as they fade into the white screen and zoom in and out and eventually stop moving. The line-up from left to right is Abi, Michael, Susan, Ben, Janey and Roger. The titles remain the same for series seven and eight; the one difference is that Janey&#x27;s clothes are changed. In series nine, the line-up changes due to Abi&#x27;s departure at the end of the previous series. Her place is taken by Alfie, who has been a regular since series six but never appeared in the titles until the ninth series. Starting in the 2009 Christmas Special, Alfie has been replaced by Kenzo.

==Writers==
The first writer for the series was its creator, Fred Barron with British writer, Penny Croft. Barron wrote eight episodes up until the fourth series. Other major writers include James Hendrie and Ian Brown who wrote numerous episodes, including the first episode together up until the 2004 Christmas Special. Steven and Jim Armogida are the only writers to remain on the show throughout its run.
Writers such as Sophie Hetherington, Georgia Pritchett, James Cary and Tess Morris have all written at least one episode for the sitcom at one point. None of these writers have written more than five episodes. Andrea Solomons has written many episodes for My Family, she wrote from the second series to the sixth series. Meanwhile, Darin Henry has written one episode for the fifth series before returning for the eighth series onwards.

Paul Minett and Brian Leveson were the sitcom&#x27;s last main writers. Credited for most of the specials, at least three episodes from every series since 2005. Bert-Tyler Moore and George Jeffrie both have written a few episodes for the sitcom in its sixth and seventh series and returned for series ten. Tom Leopold wrote two episodes for the sixth series only. Tom Anderson, the series&#x27; last executive producer and showrunner, wrote his first episode for series seven and wrote until series ten, but remained showrunner for series eleven. Ed Dyson and David Cantor have written episodes for the seventh, eighth, ninth and eleventh series.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
Initially, the show received a poor critical response, and many dismissed its humour as mundane and dated. In spite of this, the programme received above average audience ratings, and further series were commissioned, with critical approval gradually improving as the series progressed. Bruce Dessau, writing on the 100th episode, noted that it was a comedy that &quot;the critics hate, but the public love&quot;, on the basis of ratings.

Zoë Wanamaker said in 2007 that she was no longer happy with the quality of the writing, claiming she and co-star Robert Lindsay even refused to film one episode because it was so poor. In May 2009, the two stars revealed they were still unhappy with the writing quality, with Lindsay stating &quot;There&#x27;s some real dross (in the scripts) and we&#x27;re aware of it&quot;. He later admitted that the eleventh series might be the last stating &quot;As far as Zoë (Wanamaker) and I are concerned, we will do a tenth series of 16 episodes, which the BBC will probably split into a tenth and eleventh, then that will be it.&quot;

In 2004, the show came 24th in &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom&quot;.

===Ratings===
Note: The tenth series features nine episodes, but the final two did not originally air with the series and were held over and included within the eleventh series, therefore, for the purpose of listing average ratings, the two episodes will appear in the ratings table for the eleventh series as they aired in that year.

===Awards and nominations===
==Cancellation==
BBC One controller Danny Cohen, when commenting on the decision to axe the series, said &quot;Now that all the Harper children have flown the nest we feel it&#x27;s time to make room for new comedies&quot;. Robert Lindsay said in an interview with &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;m amazed by the public&#x27;s love for the series [...] When Kris Marshall left in 2005 I was convinced that was it. But somehow Zoë and I have kept the essence of it together.&quot;

<text>Naturalistic pantheism, also known as scientific pantheism, is a form of pantheism. It has been used in various ways such as to relate God or divinity with concrete things, determinism, or the substance of the universe. From these perspectives, God is seen as the aggregate of all unified natural phenomena. The phrase has often been associated with the philosophy of Baruch Spinoza, although academics differ on how it is used. Natural pantheists believe that God is the entirety of the universe and that God speaks through the scientific process.

==Component definitions==
The term &quot;pantheism&quot; is derived from Greek words &quot;pan&quot; (Greek: πᾶν) meaning &quot;all&quot; and &quot;theos&quot; (Greek: θεός) meaning God. It was coined by Joseph Raphson in his work &quot;De spatio reali&quot;, published in 1697. The term was introduced to English by Irish writer John Toland in his 1705 work &quot;Socinianism Truly Stated, By A Pantheist&quot;, which described pantheism as the &quot;opinion of those who believe in no other eternal being but the universe&quot;. The term &quot;naturalistic&quot; derives from the word &quot;naturalism&quot;, which has several meanings in philosophy and aesthetics. In philosophy, the term frequently denotes the view that everything belongs to the world of nature and can be studied with the methods appropriate for studying that world, i.e. the sciences. It generally implies an absence of belief in supernatural beings.

==Early conceptions==
Joseph Needham, a modern British scholar of Chinese philosophy and science, identified Taoism and the technology of the Wuxing as &quot;a naturalistic pantheism which emphasizes the unity and spontaneity of the operations of Nature&quot;. This philosophy can be dated to the late 4th century BCE. The Hellenistic Greek philosophical school of Stoicism (which started in the early 3rd century BCE) rejected the dualist idea of the separate ideal/conscious and material realms, and identified the substance of God with the entire cosmos and heaven. However, not all philosophers who did so can be classified as naturalistic pantheists.

==Modern conceptions==
Naturalistic pantheism was expressed by various thinkers, including Giordano Bruno, who was burned at the stake for his views. The 17th century Dutch philosopher Spinoza became particularly known for it. In 1705, the Irish writer John Toland endorsed a form of pantheism in which the God-soul is identical with the material universe. German naturalist Ernst Haeckel (1834–1919) proposed a monistic pantheism in which the idea of God is identical with that of nature or substance. The World Pantheist Movement, started in 1999, describes naturalistic pantheism as including reverence for the universe, realism, strong naturalism, and respect for reason and the scientific method as methods of understanding the world. Paul Harrison considers its position the closest modern equivalent to Toland&#x27;s.

<text>Oliver H. P. Cowdery (October 3, 1806 – March 3, 1850) was an American religious leader who, with Joseph Smith, was an important participant in the formative period of the Latter Day Saint movement between 1829 and 1836. He was the first baptized Latter Day Saint, one of the Three Witnesses to the Book of Mormon&#x27;s golden plates, one of the first Latter Day Saint apostles and the Assistant President of the Church.

Cowdery&#x27;s relationship with Joseph Smith and the church&#x27;s leadership began to deteriorate in the mid-1830s. He was excommunicated in 1838 along with several other prominent Missouri church leaders on allegations of misusing church property amid tense relations between them and Smith.

After his excommunication, Cowdery moved to Wisconsin, where he practiced law and became involved in local politics. Cowdery became a Methodist, but later returned to the Latter Day Saint movement and was rebaptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in 1848.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Oliver Cowdery was born October 3, 1806, in Wells, Vermont; his father, William, moved the family to the nearby town of Poultney when Cowdery was three years old. His mother, Rebecca Fuller Cowdery, died on September 3, 1809. In his youth, Cowdery hunted for buried treasure using a divining rod, a common practice at the time.

At age 20, Cowdery left Vermont for upstate New York, where his older brothers had settled. He clerked at a store for just over two years and in 1829 became a school teacher in Manchester. Cowdery lodged with different families in the area, including that of Joseph Smith, Sr., who was said to have provided Cowdery with additional information about the golden plates of which Cowdery said he had heard &quot;from all quarters.&quot;

===Book of Mormon scribe and witness===

Cowdery met Joseph Smith, Jr. on April 5, 1829—a year and a day before the official founding of the Church of Christ—and heard from him how he had received golden plates containing ancient reformed Egyptian writings. Cowdery told Smith that he had seen the golden plates in a vision before the two had met.

Before meeting Cowdery, Smith had virtually stopped translating after the first 116 pages had been lost by Martin Harris. Working with Cowdery, however, Smith completed the manuscript of what would become the Book of Mormon between April 7 and June 1829, in what Richard Bushman later called a &quot;burst of rapid-fire translation.&quot; Cowdery also unsuccessfully attempted to translate part of the Book of Mormon by himself.

Cowdery and Smith reported that on May 15, 1829, they received the Aaronic priesthood from the resurrected John the Baptist, after which they baptized each other in the Susquehanna River. Cowdery said that he and Smith later went into the forest and prayed &quot;until a glorious light encircled us, and as we arose on account of the light, three persons stood before us dressed in white, their faces beaming with glory.&quot; One of the three announced that he was the Apostle Peter and said the others were the apostles James and John, who many presume then gave them the Melchizedek priesthood.

Later that year, Cowdery reported sharing a vision, along with Smith and David Whitmer, in which an angel showed them the golden plates. Harris said he saw a similar vision later that day. Cowdery, Whitmer and Harris signed a statement to that effect and became known as the Three Witnesses. Their testimony has subsequently been published in nearly every edition of the Book of Mormon.

===Second Elder of the church===
When the Church of Christ was organized on April 6, 1830, Smith became &quot;First Elder&quot; and Cowdery &quot;Second Elder.&quot; Although Cowdery was technically second in authority to Smith from the organization of the church through 1838, in practice Sidney Rigdon, Smith&#x27;s &quot;spokesman&quot; and counselor in the First Presidency, began to supplant Cowdery as early as 1831. Cowdery held the position of Assistant President of the Church from 1834 until his excommunication in 1838. He was also a member of the first presiding high council of the church, organized in Kirtland, Ohio, in 1834.

On December 18, 1832, Cowdery married Elizabeth Ann Whitmer, the daughter of Peter Whitmer, Sr. and sister of David, John, Jacob and Peter Whitmer, Jr. They had six children, of whom only one daughter survived to maturity.

Cowdery helped Smith publish a series of revelations first called the Book of Commandments and later, as revised and expanded, the Doctrine and Covenants. He was also the editor, or on the editorial board, of several early church publications, including the &quot;Evening and Morning Star&quot;, the &quot;Messenger and Advocate&quot; and the &quot;Northern Times&quot;.

When the church created a bank known as the Kirtland Safety Society (KSS) in 1837, Cowdery obtained the money-printing plates. Sent by Smith to Monroe, Michigan, he became president of the Bank of Monroe, in which the church had a controlling interest. Both banks failed that same year. Cowdery moved to the newly founded Latter Day Saint settlement in Far West, Missouri, and suffered ill health through the winter of 1837–38.

===1838 split with Smith===
By early 1838, the relationship between Smith and Cowdery had deteriorated significantly. Cowdery felt that Smith&#x27;s integration of economic and political plans into religious matters was encroaching on the separation of church and state. Cowdery also expressed his concerns of Smith&#x27;s relationship with Alger, a teenage maid living with the Smiths in Kirtland in a January 1838 letter to his brother Warren:
&quot;[We] had some conversation in which in every instance I did not fail to affirm that which I had said was strictly true. A dirty, nasty, filthy affair of his and Fanny Alger&#x27;s was talked over in which I strictly declared that I had never deserted from the truth in the matter, and as I supposed was admitted by himself.&quot;In January 1838, Smith and Rigdon left Kirtland and took over the Far West, Missouri church in March 1838, which had previously been under the presidency of W. W. Phelps and David Whitmer—a close friend and brother-in-law to Cowdery. Thomas B. Marsh, David W. Patten, and Brigham Young, were ordained as the new stake presidency in Missouri. The new presidency requested John Whitmer, who had been the Church historian and recorder, and a member of the stake presidency in Missouri, to turn in his historical notes and writings. When he failed to comply, Whitmer was removed from his position, and prompted an investigation into the financial handlings of the Missouri leadership.

Nine excommunication charges were presented against Cowdery, which included selling lands in Jackson County without authorization, trying to destroy the character of Joseph Smith, and disregarding his ecclesiastical duties for the practice of law. On April 12, 1838, a church court excommunicated Cowdery. David Whitmer was also excommunicated at the same time, and apostle Lyman E. Johnson was disfellowshipped; John Whitmer and Phelps had been excommunicated a month earlier. Cowdery refused to appear before the council, but sent a letter of resignation, reiterating his desire to live his religious beliefs independent from his economic and political decisions. 

These men were became collectively known as &quot;dissenters&quot;, but continued to live in and around Far West, where they owned a great deal of property, much of which was purchased when they were acting as agents for the church. Possession became unclear and the dissenters threatened the church with lawsuits. After Rigdon delivered a sermon that implied dissenters had no place in the Latter-Day Saint community, the Danites forcibly expelled them from the county. The Danite Manifesto, a letter addressed to Cowdery and the other dissenters, was signed by some eighty-four Latter-Day Saints (but not Smith or Rigdon). It warned:
you shall have three days after you receive this communication to you, including twenty-four hours in each day, for you to depart with your families peaceably; which you may do undisturbed by any person; but in that time, if you do not depart, we will use the means in our power to cause you to depart.

Cowdery and the dissenters fled the county. Reports about their treatment circulated in nearby non-Mormon communities and increased the tension that led to the 1838 Mormon War, which ultimately resulted in the Latter-Day Saints&#x27; expulsion from Missouri.

===1838–48===
Between 1838 and 1848, Cowdery studied and practiced law in Tiffin, Ohio, where he became a civic and political leader. He joined the local Methodist church and served as secretary in 1844. Cowdery, also edited the local Democratic newspaper until it was learned that he was one of the Three Witnesses, at which time he was reassigned as assistant editor. He was nominated as his district&#x27;s Democratic Party candidate for the Ohio State Senate in 1846, but was defeated when his Mormon background was discovered.

After the Smiths’ death on June 27, 1844, a succession crisis split the Latter-Day Saint movement. Cowdery&#x27;s father and brother were followers of James J. Strang, who pressed his claim as the movement&#x27;s successor by claiming that he had found and translated ancient records engraved upon metal plates, similar to the golden plates Smith had translated in the 1820s. In 1847, Cowdery and his brother moved to Elkhorn, Wisconsin, about twelve miles away from Strang&#x27;s headquarters in Voree. In Elkhorn he entered law practice with his brother and became co-editor of the &quot;Walworth County Democrat&quot;. In 1848 he ran for state assemblyman but was again defeated when his Mormon ties were disclosed.

===LDS Church rebaptism===
In 1848, Cowdery traveled to the frontier settlement of Winter Quarters (in present-day Nebraska) to meet with followers of Brigham Young and the Quorum of the Twelve, asking to be reunited with the church. The Twelve referred the application to the high council in Pottawattamie County, Iowa, which convened a meeting with all high priests in the area to consider the matter. After Cowdery convinced the meeting attendees that he no longer maintained any claim to leadership within the church, his application for rebaptism was unanimously approved. On November 12, 1848, Cowdery was rebaptized by Orson Hyde of the Quorum of the Twelve into—what had become following the succession crisis—the LDS Church in Indian Creek at Kanesville, Iowa.

After his rebaptism, Cowdery desired to relocate to the State of Deseret (present-day Utah) in the coming spring or summer, but due to financial and health problems he decided that he would not be able to make the journey in 1849. Because he was not with the LDS settlement in the State of Deseret, he was not immediately given a position of responsibility in the church. However, in July 1849, Young wrote Cowdery a letter inviting him to travel to Washington, D.C., with Almon W. Babbitt to press the State of Deseret&#x27;s desire for statehood and to draft a formal application. Cowdery&#x27;s deteriorating health did not allow him to accept this assignment, and within eight months he had died.

In 1912, the official church magazine &quot;Improvement Era&quot; published a statement by Jacob F. Gates, son of early Mormon leader Jacob Gates, who had died twenty years prior. According to the recollection by his son, the elder Gates had visited Cowdery in 1849 and inquired about his witness testimony concerning the Book of Mormon. Cowdery reportedly reaffirmed his witness:

&quot;Jacob, I want you to remember what I say to you. I am a dying man, and what would it profit me to tell you a lie? I know,&quot; said he, &quot;that this Book of Mormon was translated by the gift and power of God. My eyes saw, my ears heard, and my understanding was touched, and I know that whereof I testified is true. It was no dream, no vain imagination of the mind—it was real&quot;.

Cowdery then traveled to meet with Whitmer in Richmond, Missouri to persuade him to move west and rejoin the Saints in Utah Territory. Cowdery, however, succumbed to tuberculosis and died March 3, 1850 in David Whitmer&#x27;s home in Richmond.

==As purported co-author of the Book of Mormon==

Critics who doubt the origin theory of the Book of Mormon have speculated that Cowdery may have played a role in the work&#x27;s composition. LDS scholar Daniel Peterson argues against this theory noting that analysis of the manuscripts indicates that the Book of Mormon was primarily the product of Joseph Smith&#x27;s dictation, rather than a collaborative effort — it contains aural errors, typical of a transcription process. Additionally, the Printer&#x27;s Manuscript, which Cowdery assisted in producing, contains significant copyist errors in his handwriting, suggesting he was not fully aware of the book&#x27;s content beforehand.

===Speculation of pre-1829 connection between Cowdery and Smith===
Cowdery was a of Lucy Mack Smith, Joseph Smith&#x27;s mother. There is also a geographical connection between the Smiths and the Cowderys. During the 1790s, both Joseph Smith, Sr. and Lucy Mack Smith, and two of Cowdery&#x27;s relatives were living in Tunbridge, Vermont.

; New Israelites

Joseph Smith, Sr. and Cowdery&#x27;s father, William, may have been members of a Congregationalist sect known as the New Israelites, organized in Rutland County, Vermont. The Cowdery family lived in Rutland County in the early 19th century and later attended a Congregationalist church in Poultney, Vermont. Witnesses from Vermont connected William Cowdery to the sect before these witnesses could have known that his son, Oliver, was a dowser.

Vermont residents interviewed by a local historian said that Joseph Smith, Sr. was also a member of the New Israelites and was one of its &quot;leading rods-men&quot;. But although residents said that he lived in Poultney, Vermont, &quot;at the time of the Wood movement here&quot;, there are no other records placing Smith closer than about 50 miles away. On the other hand, Smith&#x27;s involvement with the New Israelites would be consistent with his links to Congregationalism and the report from James C. Brewster that in 1837 Smith, Sr. admitted that he entered the money digging business &quot;more than thirty years&quot; ago.

===Cowdery and &quot;View of the Hebrews&quot;===

For several years, Cowdery and his family attended the Congregational Church in Poultney, Vermont, when its minister was the Rev. Ethan Smith, author of &quot;View of the Hebrews&quot;, an 1823 book suggesting that Native Americans were of Hebrew origin, a not uncommon speculation during the colonial and early national periods. In 2000, David Persuitte argued that Cowdery&#x27;s knowledge of &quot;View of the Hebrews&quot; significantly contributed to the final version of the Book of Mormon, a connection first suggested as early as 1902. Fawn Brodie wrote that it &quot;may never be proved that Joseph saw &quot;View of the Hebrews&quot; before writing the Book of Mormon, but the striking parallelisms between the two books hardly leave a case for mere coincidence.&quot; Richard Bushman and John W. Welch reject the connection and argue that there is little relationship between the contents of the two books.

<text>The varied thrush (Ixoreus naevius) is a member of the thrush family, Turdidae. It is the only species in the monotypic genus Ixoreus.

==Taxonomy==

The varied thrush was formally described by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1789 under the binomial name &quot;Turdus naevius&quot;. Gmelin based his description of the &quot;Spotted thrush&quot; that had been described by John Latham in 1783 from specimens owned by Joseph Banks. These had been collected near Nootka Sound (formerly King George&#x27;s Sound) which separates Nootka Island from Vancouver Island on the Pacific coast of Canada. The varied thrush is now the only species placed in the genus &quot;Ixoreus&quot; that was introduced by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1854. The genus name &quot;Ixoreus&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek &quot;ixos&quot; meaning &quot;mistletoe&quot;. This was a synonym of a former name for the mockingbird genus, &quot;Mimus&quot;; Bonaparte assumed wrongly that, because William Swainson had shown a mockingbird and this thrush on the same plate of his book, they were related. The specific &quot;naevius&quot; is Latin for &quot;spotted&quot; from &quot;naevus&quot; meaning &quot;spot&quot;.

Four subspecies are recognised:

* &quot;I. n. meruloides&quot; – : Found in south Alaska and northwestern Canada
* &quot;I. n. naevius&quot; – : nominate, found in southeastern Alaska and western Canada to west central USA
* &quot;I. n. carlottae&quot; – : found in Haida Gwaii
* &quot;I. n. godfreii&quot; – : found in the Interior and Columbia Plateau west of the Rocky Mountains

==Description==
The varied thrush is a fairly large thrush species. It can range from in length and can span across the wings. Body mass can vary from . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the bill is and the tarsus is . It is similar in size to the widespread American robin, though the varied is on average shorter with a heavier, more robust build. In general, varied thrushes feature intense orange and black feathers. Adult males exhibit medium orange with a curved gray pattern at the breasts and throats, with grayish-blue tail ends, scruffs, and crowns. They also possess a tufted supraloral stripe and streaks of dark colors on its flight feathers. Its bill is also achromatic, but tan near the bottom of the lower jaw. Its legs are often tawny or dark brown. Females&#x27; markings are not as well-defined, with olive-browns and grays, brown hind feathers, and indiscernible gray-brown plumage near the breasts. Young varied thrushes are generally brown, though their stomach feathers are white, and initially harbor two orange stripes at the covert feathers.

Eggs are generally 3–4 per nest, but sometimes 2–5. Pale blue, lightly dotted with brown. Incubation is by female, probably about 2 weeks. Young: Both parents feed nestlings. Development of young and age at which they leave the nest are not well known. Probably 2 broods per year.
There is an extremely rare variant of this species in which all the orange in the plumage is replaced by white. A very rare British vagrant in 1982 was of this type, leading to speculation that whatever mutation causes the colour variation also affects the navigational abilities of this thrush. There have been only five recorded sightings since 1921.

==Distribution and habitat==
The varied thrush breeds in western North America from Alaska to northern California. It is migratory, with northern breeders moving south within or somewhat beyond the breeding range. Other populations may only move altitudinally. This species is an improbable transatlantic vagrant, but there are now two accepted western European records, both in Great Britain, in 1982 and on Papa Westray in the Orkney Islands in October 2021.

Nests in Alaska, Yukon Territory, and mountains in British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon. Prefers moist conifer forest. Most common in dense, older conifer forests in high elevations. Moves to lower elevations during the winter where it is often seen in towns and orchards and thickets, or migrates to California. Seen in flocks during winter of up to 20 birds. It is well known for individual birds to fly eastward in winter, showing up in just about any state, then returning to the west coast for breeding.

==Feeding==
The varied thrush is predominantly insectivorous, though its diet varies throughout the course of the year. During the summer, ground-dwelling arthropods make up the bulk of its diet. During migration and winter, however, the focus of the thrush&#x27;s diet shifts to fruits, seeds, and acorns, though arthropods are still taken in some quantity. Varied thrushes consume a wide variety of berries throughout the year, including snowberry, red huckleberry, California honeysuckle, madrone, salmonberry, and thimbleberry.

Varied thrushes forage primarily on the ground, except when foraging for fruits and berries.

==Breeding==
The breeding habitat is dense coniferous forest, with two to five eggs being laid in a tree nest.

<text>Mississippi is best known as the home of the blues which developed among the freed African Americans in the latter half of the 19th century and beginning 20th century. The Delta blues is the style most closely associated with the state, and includes performers like Charley Patton, Robert Johnson (buried in Greenwood, MS), David &quot;Honeyboy&quot; Edwards, Willie Brown, Tommy Johnson, Ishmon Bracey, Bo Carter, Sam Chatmon, Mississippi John Hurt, Furry Lewis, Son House, Skip James, Muddy Waters, Howlin&#x27; Wolf, John Lee Hooker, Pinetop Perkins, Albert King and B.B. King. 

==Indigenous music==
== Country ==
The fiddle and banjo are common folk instruments in Mississippi, which has also seen some development as a gospel, country music, and Appalachian folk music center. Country blues artist Robert Wilkins and Songster Jim Jackson of Hernando made influential recordings in the late 1920s-1930s. The Leake County Revelers&#x27; brand of folk music saw some national popularity late in the 1930s, at around the same time as Mississippi native Jimmie Rodgers innovated modern country music. McComb was the birthplace of Bo Diddley (d.2008), a highly influential early rock and roll artist.

== Soul/R&amp;B ==
R&amp;B singer Rufus Thomas was born in Cayce. James Carr, Otis Clay, Dorothy Moore, Denise Lasalle and Wiilie Mitchell were from Mississippi.Electric blues singer and guitarist Little Milton was born in Inverness. Soul singer and songwriter Jerry Butler was born in Sunflower. Mississippi was also home to Malaco Records, a well-known indie R&amp;B label. Record producers such as Quin Ivy and Quinton Claunch were from Mississippi also.

== Rock/pop ==
Elvis Presley from Tupelo, had 18 No. 1 hits in the U.S. from 1956 to 1969. Jimmy Buffett was born in Pascagoula, MS and graduated from the University of Southern Mississippi in 1969. Southern rock band North Mississippi Allstars formed in Hernando in 1996. Alternative rock band 3 Doors Down, known for &quot;Kryptonite&quot; are from Escatawpa. They had two No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200 chart, such as &quot;3 Doors Down&quot; in 2008. The post-grunge band Saving Abel, known for &quot;Addicted&quot;, formed in Corinth. The trap duo Rae Sremmurd from Tupelo had a No. 1 Billboard Hot 100 hit with &quot;Black Beatles&quot; in 2016. The Mississippi Coliseum in Jackson is one of the most famous music venues in the state, since it opened in 1962 and has hosted a few MS musicians from Presley to 3 Doors Down.

==Jug band==
Gus Cannon, born in Red Banks, helped popularize jug bands in the 1920-1930s with his &quot;Jug Stompers&quot;.

== Delta blues ==

The Delta blues is often regarded as the most rootsy or traditional style of the blues, or as the ultimate origins of the blues. The style has also been called the &quot;most influential form of rural blues (with an) eerie, sometimes demonic power that is unmatched by other American acoustic music&quot;. Many of these performers recorded in the early 20th century; however, by the 1950s, they were largely forgotten outside of Mississippi. Many moved to Chicago, and became a part of the more mainstream Chicago blues scene.

In the 1960s, however, a roots revival began across the United States, and interest in Mississippi&#x27;s blues musicians increased.

<doc id="412860" wikidata="Q6942312" url="?curid=412860" title="Music of Utah">
<text>The cultural Music of Utah, while having been significantly influenced by the presence of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), includes several thriving local scenes and a large number of musicians across a variety of genres. That said, much of the distinctiveness of Utah&#x27;s musical traditions has derived from the interaction between individuals of multiple beliefs in the uniquely religious context of the state.

== Contemporary Utah music scene ==
Utah has produced some popular recording artists since 2000. Its local music scene features some nationally recognized bands, mostly based in Provo and Salt Lake City. Notable bands include Neon Trees, Fictionist, Imagine Dragons, The New Electric Sound, The Moth &amp; the Flame, King Niko and The Brobecks. Many genres are represented, including rock, indie folk, emo, synthpop, singer-songwriter, death metal, blues, punk rock, goth, alternative rock, hip hop, jazz, country, Reggae, Ska and religious music.

=== Hip Hop and R&amp;B ===
JTM released his debut &quot;I&#x27;m Not a Rapper&quot; in 2016 which reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Heatseekers chart and No. 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B/Hip-Hop chart.

UT-born producer KC Supreme has received multiple Multi-Platinum awards as well as multiple &quot;Billboard&quot; #1 awards. His production credits include Trevor Daniel, Lil Uzi Vert, Future, Juice Wrld, Lil Tecca, Rich The Kid, Chris Brown, T-Pain, Trippie Redd, Kevin Gates, Megan Thee Stallion, Yk Osiris, Rico Nasty, Lil Tjay, 24k Goldn, Yung Pinch, Quando Rondo, Fredo Bang, Iann Dior, YNW Melly, blackbear, Summer Walker, Don Toliver, Lil Skies, etc.

=== Rock ===
Utah has enjoyed a substantial rock music scene. Sky Saxon, frontman and founder to influential 1960&#x27;s Garage Rock and Proto-Punk band The Seeds, was born and grew up in Salt Lake City. Before finding international success with The Seeds, he recorded and released a string of Doo-Wop singles under the name &quot;Little Richie Marsh&quot; and founded Salt Lake bands &quot;The Electra-Fires&quot; and &quot;&quot;The Soul Rockers&quot;.&quot;

More contemporarily, Post-Hardcore band The Used (Warner Music Group-owned Reprise Records) was formed in Orem in 2001. The Used have released two gold-certified albums in the United States.

Neon Trees (formerly Mercury Records) formed in Provo, Utah in the early 2000s. In 2010, their single, &quot;Animal,&quot; reached number one on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart. Neon Trees have released two multi-platinum singles domestically.

Sisters Meg and Dia Frampton formed Meg &amp; Dia in Draper and until recently were signed to Warner Music Group-owned label, Doghouse Records.

Royal Bliss, from Salt Lake City signed with Capitol Records in 2007.

Fictionist, from Provo was signed with Atlantic Records between 2011 and 2014.

Imagine Dragons (Interscope Records) formed in Provo in 2008, and later moved to Las Vegas after winning battle of the bands competitions at Velour Music Gallery (Provo, UT) and Brigham Young University. The band&#x27;s single &quot;Radioactive&quot; earned a Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance. They have received four diamond certified singles domestically to date and are widely regarded as one of the most popular contemporary rock artists in recent years.

=== Folk ===
Folk music constituted some of the earliest music in Utah. Songs were usually sung without accompaniment because of the scarcity of musical instruments in the region. Although often employing the same traditional tunes as folk music elsewhere, Mormon settlers sometimes altered lyrical themes in reference to their own lives and religious convictions.

Peter Breinholt, a Salt Lake City native, found success in the 1990s as a Singer-Songwriter following the self-release a series of tapes, largely by word of mouth. Initially centered in and around The University of Utah&#x27;s underground music scene, Breinholt&#x27;s music eventually proliferated through the state and surrounding Southwest region. As of 2023, his debut LP, &quot;Songs About the Great Divide&quot; was the fastest selling independently released album in the state&#x27;s history. Currently a music professor at Snow College, Breinholt has since released seven full lengths albums and performed with Jon Schmidt, Masa Fukuda, Steven Sharp Nelson, Paul Cardall and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. In 2002, he performed at the 2002 Winter Olympics.

Newgrass artists Ryan Shupe and the RubberBand had a country music hit single in 2005, &quot;Dream Big.&quot; while they were signed to Capitol Records.

Provo based folk singer-songwriter Joshua James had moderate success in 2007 when his album &quot;The Sun is Always Brighter&quot; reached number 1 on the iTunes Folk Album chart.

Provo songwriter Isaac Russell left his deal with Utah-based Northplatte Records to sign with Columbia Records only to later return to Northplatte Records.

Neofolk rock group Parlor Hawk were featured by iTunes Indie Spotlight as one of the &quot;Best of 2010 Singer-Songwriter Albums&quot; and earned an Independent Music Award for &quot;Saddest Song&quot; in 2012.

The National Parks formed in 2013 in Provo, UT. Their debut album reached No. 13 on the iTunes singer/songwriter charts and single &quot;As We Ran&quot; has been streamed more than 25M times on Spotify.

Ogden based folk singer-songwriter Sammy Brue signed to New West Records and released his debut album in 2017.

=== Pop ===
In 2007, David Archuleta rose to the national spotlight as a major contestant in the seventh season of American Idol. His debut pop album on Jive Records was certified gold by the RIAA.

Provo-based songwriter Mindy Gledhill&#x27;s 2010 pop album &quot;Anchor&quot; became a hit abroad including seven songs charting on the South Korean charts and tours in SE Asia. The album sold more than 15,000 copies.

=== Metal ===

<doc id="412862" wikidata="Q714820" url="?curid=412862" title="Satsuma Rebellion">
<text>The Satsuma Rebellion, also known as the , was a revolt of disaffected samurai against the new imperial government of the Empire of Japan, nine years into the Meiji era. Its name comes from the Satsuma Domain, which had been influential in the Restoration and became home to unemployed samurai after military reforms rendered their status obsolete. The rebellion lasted from 29 January until 24 September of 1877, when it was decisively crushed, and its leader, Saigō Takamori, was shot and mortally wounded.

Saigō&#x27;s rebellion was the last and most serious of a series of armed uprisings against the new government of the Empire of Japan, the predecessor state to modern Japan. The rebellion was very expensive for the government, which forced it to make numerous monetary reforms including leaving the gold standard. The conflict effectively ended the samurai class and ushered in modern warfare fought by conscript soldiers instead of military nobles. It is also the most recent civil war fought in Japan.

==Background==
Although Satsuma had been one of the key players in the Meiji Restoration and the Boshin War, and although many men from Satsuma had risen to influential positions in the new Meiji government, there was growing dissatisfaction with the direction the country was taking. The modernization of the country meant the abolition of the privileged social status of the samurai class - contrasting with the original reformist vision of creating a parliament of Daimyos, and had undermined their financial position. The very rapid and massive changes to Japanese culture, language, dress and society appeared to many samurai to be a betrayal of the &quot;jōi&quot; (&#x27;expel the barbarian&#x27;) portion of the &quot;sonnō jōi&quot; justification used to overthrow the former Tokugawa shogunate.

Saigō Takamori was a well known and powerful Samurai lord of his time and one of the senior leaders of the Satsuma clan, he fiercely supported the imperial faction throughout Bakumatsu and was one of the prominent restoration figures during the Boshin war, he was especially concerned about growing political corruption – popular prints depicted the rebel army with banners bearing the words . Saigō was a strong proponent of war with Korea in the &quot;Seikanron&quot; debate of 1873. At one point, he offered to visit Korea in person and to provide a &quot;casus belli&quot; by the likely outcome of his being assassinated by Korean nationalists. Saigō expected both that a war would ultimately be successful for Japan and also that the initial stages of it would offer a means by which the samurai whose cause he championed could find meaningful and beneficial death. When the plan was rejected, Saigō resigned from all of his government positions in protest and returned to his hometown of Kagoshima, as did many other Satsuma ex-samurai in the military and police forces.

To help support and employ these men, in 1874 Saigō established a private academy known as the Shi-gakkō in Kagoshima. Soon 132 branches were established all over the prefecture. The “training” provided was not purely academic: although the Chinese classics were taught, all students were required to take part in weapons training and instruction in tactics. Saigō also started an artillery school. The schools resembled paramilitary political organizations more than anything else, and they enjoyed the support of the governor of Satsuma, who appointed disaffected samurai to political offices, where they came to dominate the Kagoshima government. Support for Saigō was so strong that Satsuma had effectively seceded from the central government by the end of 1876. This was similar to the Satsuma and Choshu&#x27;s position during Bakumatsu, in which the Shogunate maintained little control over these domains.

== Status of combatants ==
=== Imperial military ===
As per the 1873 conscription law, Japan was divided into six military districts with conscripts drawn by lots, with seven years service (three active and four reserve) for the conscripted and service for 20 years in the national militia for those not chosen for active service. 

A cavalry squadron contained 150 in wartime. However, due to difficulties in securing horses suited for modern war, only three squadrons were available, for a total of 450 cavalrymen (including the Imperial guard squadron). An infantry regiment had three battalions of 1,088 men and 16 battalion staff each. 14 such regiments existed for a total of 45,920 infantry. An engineer company contained 150 men. The engineers had 10 companies, giving a total of 1,500 engineers. The train companies contained 80 men. There were a total of six companies giving a total of 480 men. There were also nine coastal artillery battalions of 100 men, a total of 900 men. 

The mobile artillery consisted of 12 mountain gun batteries with 1,920 men and six field gun batteries with 780 men, with each battery containing 12 guns. A total of 2,700 men with 108 guns were in the mobile artillery.

The imperial guard, a force drawn from the pro-imperial forces of the Boshin War, was organised into two regiments of infantry (4,384), one cavalry squadron (150), one artillery battalion (12 guns and 290 men), one engineer company (150), and a train company (80 men), giving a total of 5,054 men.

==== Imperial police ====
In 1871, the imperial government organised the Rasotsu, which expanded rapidly from its original 3,000 to 18,000 in 1877. These policemen were militarised and saw action throughout the rebellion. During the conflict, the government side expended, on average, 322,000 rounds of ammunition and 1,000 artillery shells per day.

=== Rebel forces ===
The forces of Saigo were only partly modernised, with an ad hoc organisation made in 1877 with 6 infantry battalions of 2,000 men, each with 10 companies of 200 per battalion. There was little to no cavalry in the rebel army and only 200 gunners for the 28 mountain, 2 field and 30 mortar pieces assembled by the rebels.

==Prelude==
Word of Saigō&#x27;s academies was greeted with considerable concern in Tokyo. The government had just dealt with several small but violent samurai revolts in Kyūshū, and they found the prospect of rebellion by the numerous and fierce Satsuma samurai, led by the famous and popular Saigō, an alarming one. In December 1876, the Meiji government sent a police officer named Nakahara Hisao and 57 other men to investigate reports of subversive activities and unrest. The men were captured, and under torture, confessed that they were spies who had been sent to assassinate Saigō. Although Nakahara later repudiated the confession, it was widely believed in Satsuma and was used as justification by the disaffected samurai that a rebellion was necessary in order to &quot;protect Saigō&quot;. Fearing a rebellion, the Meiji government sent a warship to Kagoshima to remove the weapons stockpiled at the Kagoshima arsenal on 30 January 1877. This, accompanied by an elimination of samurai rice stipends in 1877, provoked open conflict. Outraged by the government&#x27;s tactics, 50 students from Saigō&#x27;s academy attacked the Somuta Arsenal and carried off weapons. Over the next three days, more than 1000 students staged raids on the naval yards and other arsenals.

Presented with this sudden success, the greatly dismayed Saigō was reluctantly persuaded to come out of his semi-retirement to lead the rebellion against the central government.

In February 1877, the Meiji government dispatched Hayashi Tomoyuki, an official with the Home Ministry with Admiral Kawamura Sumiyoshi in the warship &quot;Takao&quot; to ascertain the situation. Satsuma&#x27;s governor, Oyama Tsunayoshi, explained that the uprising was in response to the government&#x27;s assassination attempt on Saigō, and asked that Admiral Kawamura (Saigō&#x27;s cousin) come ashore to help calm the situation. After Oyama departed, a flotilla of small ships filled with armed men attempted to board &quot;Takao&quot; by force, but were repelled. The following day, Hayashi declared to Oyama that he could not permit Kawamura to go ashore when the situation was so unsettled, and that the attack on &quot;Takao&quot; constituted an act of lèse-majesté.

On his return to Kobe on 12 February, Hayashi met with General Yamagata Aritomo and Itō Hirobumi, and it was decided that the Imperial Japanese Army would need to be sent to Kagoshima to prevent the revolt from spreading to other areas of the country sympathetic to Saigō. On the same day, Saigō met with his lieutenants Kirino Toshiaki and Shinohara Kunimoto and announced his intention of marching to Tokyo to ask questions of the government. Rejecting large numbers of volunteers, he made no attempt to contact any of the other domains for support, and no troops were left at Kagoshima to secure his base against an attack. To aid in the air of legality, Saigō wore his army uniform. Marching north, his army was hampered by the deepest snowfall Satsuma had seen in more than 50 years, which, because of the similarity to the weather that had greeted those setting out to enact the Meiji Restoration nine years earlier, was interpreted by some as a sign of divine support.

==The Southwestern War==

===Siege of Kumamoto Castle===
The Satsuma vanguard crossed into Kumamoto Prefecture on 14 February. The commandant of Kumamoto Castle, Major General Tani Tateki had 3,800 soldiers and 600 policemen at his disposal. However, most of the garrison was from Kyūshū, while a significant number of officers were natives of Kagoshima; their loyalties were open to question. Rather than risk desertions or defections, Tani decided to stand on the defensive. On 19 February, the first shots of the war were fired as the defenders of Kumamoto Castle opened fire on Satsuma units attempting to force their way into the castle. Kumamoto Castle, built in 1598, was among the strongest in Japan, but Saigō was confident that his forces would be more than a match for Tani&#x27;s conscripts, who were still demoralized by the recent Shinpūren rebellion.

On 22 February, the main Satsuma army arrived and attacked Kumamoto Castle in a pincer movement. Fighting continued into the night. Imperial forces fell back, and acting Major Nogi Maresuke of the Kokura Fourteenth Regiment lost the regimental colors in fierce fighting. However, despite their successes, the Satsuma army failed to take the castle and began to realize that the conscript army was not as ineffective as first assumed. After two days of fruitless attack, the Satsuma forces dug into the rock-hard icy ground around the castle and tried to starve the garrison out in a siege. The situation was especially desperate for the defenders as their stores of food and ammunition had been depleted by a warehouse fire shortly before the rebellion began. During the siege, many Kumamoto ex-samurai flocked to Saigō&#x27;s banner, swelling his forces to around 20,000 men. In the meantime, on March 9, Saigō, Kirino, and Shinohara were stripped of their court ranks and titles.

On the night of 8 April, a force from Kumamoto Castle made a sortie, forcing open a gap in the Satsuma lines and enabling desperately needed supplies to reach the garrison. The main Imperial Army, under General Kuroda Kiyotaka with the assistance of General Yamakawa Hiroshi, arrived in Kumamoto on 12 April, putting the now heavily outnumbered Satsuma forces to flight.

===Battle of Tabaruzaka===
On 4 March, Imperial Army General Yamagata ordered a frontal assault against Tabaruzaka, guarding the approaches to Kumamoto, which developed into an eight-day-long battle. Tabaruzaka was held by some 15,000 samurai from Satsuma, Kumamoto and Hitoyoshi against the Imperial Army&#x27;s 9th Infantry Brigade (some 9,000 men). At the height of the battle, Saigō wrote a private letter to Prince Arisugawa, restating his reasons for going to Tokyo. His letter indicated that he was not committed to rebellion and sought a peaceful settlement. The government, however, refused to negotiate.

In order to cut Saigō off from his base, an imperial force with three warships, 500 policemen, and several companies of infantry landed in Kagoshima on 8 March, seized arsenals, and took Satsuma&#x27;s governor into custody.

Yamagata also landed a detachment with two infantry brigades and 1,200 policemen behind the rebel lines, so as to fall on them from the rear from Yatsushiro Bay. Imperial forces landed with few losses, then pushed north seizing the city of Miyanohara on 19 March. After receiving reinforcements, the imperial force, now totaling 4,000 men, attacked the rear elements of the Satsuma army and drove them back.

Tabaruzaka was one of the most intense campaigns of the war. Imperial forces emerged victorious, but with heavy casualties on both sides. Each side had suffered more than 4,000 killed or wounded.

===Retreat from Kumamoto===
After his failure to take Kumamoto, Saigō led his followers on a seven-day march to Hitoyoshi. Morale was extremely low, and lacking any strategy, the Satsuma forces dug in to wait for the next Imperial Army offensive. However, the Imperial Army was likewise depleted, and fighting was suspended for several weeks to permit reinforcement. When the offensive was resumed, Saigo retreated to Miyazaki, leaving behind numerous pockets of samurai in the hills to conduct guerrilla attacks.

On 24 July, the Imperial Army forced Saigō out of Miyakonojō, followed by Nobeoka. Troops were landed at Ōita and Saiki north of Saigō&#x27;s army, and Saigō was caught in a pincer attack. However, the Satsuma army was able to cut its way free from encirclement. By 17 August, the Satsuma army had been reduced to 3000 combatants, and had lost most of its modern firearms and all of its artillery.

The surviving rebels made a stand on the slopes of Mount Enodake, and were soon surrounded. Determined not to let the rebels escape again, Yamagata sent in a large force which outnumbered the Satsuma army 7:1. Most of Saigō&#x27;s remaining forces either surrendered or committed &quot;seppuku&quot;. However, Saigō burned his private papers and army uniform on 19 August, and slipped away towards Kagoshima with his remaining able-bodied men. Despite Yamagata&#x27;s efforts over the next several days, Saigō and his remaining 500 men reached Kagoshima on September 1 and seized Shiroyama, overlooking the city.

===Battle of Shiroyama===

Saigō and his remaining samurai were pushed back to Kagoshima where, in a final battle, the Battle of Shiroyama, Imperial Army troops under the command of General Yamagata Aritomo and marines under the command of Admiral Kawamura Sumiyoshi outnumbered Saigō 60-to-1. However, Yamagata was determined to leave nothing to chance. The imperial troops spent several days constructing an elaborate system of ditches, walls and obstacles to prevent another breakout. The five government warships in Kagoshima harbor added their firepower to Yamagata&#x27;s artillery, and began to systematically reduce the rebel positions.

After Saigō rejected a letter dated September 1 from Yamagata drafted by a young Suematsu Kenchō asking him to surrender, Yamagata ordered a full frontal assault on 24 September 1877. By 6 a.m., only 40 rebels were still alive. Saigō was severely wounded. Legend says that one of his followers, Beppu Shinsuke, acted as &quot;kaishakunin&quot; and aided Saigō in committing &quot;seppuku&quot; before he could be captured. However, other evidence contradicts this, stating that Saigō in fact died of the bullet wound and then had his head removed by Beppu in order to preserve his dignity.

After Saigo&#x27;s death, Beppu and the last of the &quot;ex-samurai&quot; drew their swords and plunged downhill toward the Imperial positions and to their deaths. With these deaths, the Satsuma rebellion came to an end.

==Aftermath==
Financially, crushing the Satsuma Rebellion cost the government a total of (£8,400,000), forcing Japan off the gold standard and causing the government to print paper currency. Economic effects of the Satsuma Rebellion resulted in the passing of the Act of 4 February 1877, which reduced the land tax from 3% to 2.5%. The Rebellion reduced Japan&#x27;s yearly expenditure from £13,700,000 to £10,250,000, and it raised Japan&#x27;s national debt from £28,000,000 to £70,000,000. The costs of pacifying the former samurai led to the Meiji government becoming virtually bankrupt; the government was forced to sell off state-owned enterprises such as factories and mines to politically-connected merchants and former officials at low prices, leading to the instant formation of large industrial firms or zaibatsu. These state-owned industries had been operating at a loss, and Finance Minister Matsukata Masayoshi decided to sell all of these to politically connected capitalists at a loss, except the railroad, telegraph and military industries. He also cancelled scholarships for Japanese students abroad and fired foreign experts. Meanwhile, the remnants of the militaristic faction that supported Saigo&#x27;s invasion proposal evolved into Japanese right-wing groups such as the genyosha and kokuryūkai. 

The rebellion also effectively ended the samurai class, as the new Imperial Japanese Army built on heimin conscripts had proven itself in battle. More critically, the defeat of the samurai displayed the power of modern artillery and rifles, against which a banzai charge had no appreciable effect. On 22 February 1889, Emperor Meiji pardoned Saigō posthumously. Statues in Ueno Park, Tokyo and near the ruins of Kagoshima Castle stand in his memory. Saigō Takamori was labelled as a tragic hero by the people, and his actions were considered an honorable example of bushido and Yamato-damashii.

==Name==
In English, the most common name for the war is the &quot;Satsuma Rebellion&quot;. Mark Ravina, the author of &quot;The Last Samurai: The Life and Battles of Saigo Takamori&quot;, argued that &quot;Satsuma Rebellion&quot; is not the best name for the war because the English name does not well represent the war and its Japanese name. Ravina said that the war&#x27;s scope was much farther than Satsuma, and he characterizes the event as being closer to a civil war than a rebellion. Ravina prefers the English name &quot;War of the Southwest.&quot;

==In popular culture==

Western interpretations include the 2003 American film &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; directed by Edward Zwick, which combines into a single narrative historical situations belonging both to the Boshin War, the Satsuma Rebellion, and other similar uprisings of ex-samurai during the early Meiji period.

Also, the song Shiroyama in the album The Last Stand by the Swedish power metal band Sabaton is about the Satsuma rebellion.

<text>American Atheists is a non-profit organization in the United States dedicated to defending the civil liberties of atheists and advocating complete separation of church and state. It provides speakers for colleges, universities, clubs, and the news media. It also publishes books and &quot;American Atheist Magazine&quot;.

The organization was founded in 1963 by Madalyn Murray O&#x27;Hair. She had earlier filed a lawsuit against her school board, with her son William J. Murray as plaintiff, to challenge compulsory prayer and Bible-reading in public schools. Her case, &quot;Murray v. Curlett&quot;, was consolidated with &quot;Abington School District v. Schempp&quot; before being heard by the United States Supreme Court. In 1963, it ruled that mandatory Bible reading in public schools was unconstitutional.

==History==

===Origin and early legal action===
American Atheists was founded in 1963 by Madalyn Murray O&#x27;Hair as the Society of Separationists, after the legal cases &quot;Abington School District v. Schempp&quot; and &quot;Murray v. Curlett&quot; (1959) were filed. (These were consolidated before being heard on appeal by the US Supreme Court.) Both &quot;Schempp&quot; and &quot;Murray&quot; challenged mandatory prayer in public schools. Over the years American Atheists has filed numerous lawsuits against public institutions considered to have breached the constitutional separation between church and state. The organization, which has over 3,500 members, is headquartered in Cranford, New Jersey.

In 1959, Murray filed a case on behalf of her son, William J. Murray, who was being forced to attend Bible readings in school. He was harassed by teachers and school administrators for refusing to participate.

The consolidated case, usually cited as &quot;Abington School District v. Schempp&quot;, was argued before the United States Supreme Court on February 27 and 28, 1963.

In her opening statement, Madalyn Murray said, in part:
&quot;Your petitioners are atheists and they define their beliefs as follows. An atheist loves his fellow man instead of god. An atheist believes that heaven is something for which we should work now – here on earth for all men together to enjoy. An atheist believes that he can get no help through prayer but that he must find in himself the inner conviction and strength to meet life, to grapple with it, to subdue it, and enjoy it. An atheist believes that only in a knowledge of himself and a knowledge of his fellow man can he find the understanding that will help to a life of fulfillment. He seeks to know himself and his fellow man rather than to know a god. An atheist believes that a hospital should be built instead of a church. An atheist believes that a deed must be done instead of a prayer said. An atheist strives for involvement in life and not escape into death. He wants disease conquered, poverty vanquished, war eliminated. He wants man to understand and love man. He wants an ethical way of life. He believes that we cannot rely on a god or channel action into prayer nor hope for an end of troubles in a hereafter. He believes that we are our brother&#x27;s keepers and are keepers of our own lives; that we are responsible persons and the job is here and the time is now.&quot;

The justices rendered their decision on June 17, 1963. It was in favor of the petitioners, 8–1. They ruled that state-mandated prayer and unison bible readings in public schools were a violation of the Establishment Clause in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Justice Potter Stewart was the sole dissenter.

===Leadership===
;O&#x27;Hair (1963–1995)
On August 27, 1995, Madalyn, Jon and Robin O&#x27;Hair disappeared from the organization&#x27;s former Austin, Texas, headquarters, along with over $550,000 of the organization&#x27;s funds. The three were later found to have been abducted, robbed and murdered by David Waters, an ex-convict and former employee.

;Johnson (1995–2008)
Ellen Johnson succeeded O&#x27;Hair as president. Johnson was among the featured speakers at the Godless Americans March on Washington on November 2, 2002. That same year, American Atheists took Wildwood, Florida, to court for &quot;displaying religious decorations at City Hall.&quot;

The group held their 30th annual national convention in 2004, attracting several best-selling atheist authors and leaders from other secular organizations.

American Atheists helped organize a 2006 campaign against the &quot;no atheists in foxholes&quot; claim. Master Sgt. Kathleen Johnson, founder of the Military Association of Atheists and Freethinkers, maintained that many &quot;people manage to serve without having to call on a higher power.&quot; The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs eventually approved the logo of the American Atheists to be an &quot;emblem of belief&quot; for placement on government headstones and markers.

In May 2007, ABC News featured a report on treatment of the Smalkowski family, declared atheists, by school officials in their small town of Hardesty, Oklahoma. The report said that American Atheists had filed a lawsuit on behalf of the Smalkowski family. The lawsuit alleges the Hardesty Public School District violated Nicole Smalkowski&#x27;s constitutional rights with bullying behavior, trumped-up charges, and suspension from the school basketball team. Also that May, Joe Zamecki of American Atheists organized a local demonstration at the state capitol building in Austin, Texas, against the National Day of Prayer.

The organization announced via its blog on May 2, 2008, that Johnson was leaving the presidency of American Atheists for unspecified reasons. It was later revealed that her removal was not voluntary.

;Buckner (2008–2010)

Following the May 2008 appointment of Frank Zindler as interim president, Ed Buckner was appointed president in September 2008 and remained in the position until September 2010.

;Silverman (2010–2018)

David Silverman became president in September 2010, until his termination in April 2018, following an internal investigation over allegations of sexual assaults and financial conflicts.

;Nick Fish (2018 to present)

Following the May 2018 appointment of Ed Buckner as Interim Executive Director, Nick Fish became president in September 2018.

===Godless Americans PAC===
In November 2005, the Godless Americans Political Action Committee (GAPAC), an American PAC, was formed by American Atheists to endorse political candidates who support the separation of church and state. According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, atheists subsequently have become more outspoken about being an ignored voice in the United States.

The PAC officially states it does not want government to associate with religion in any way. It opposes Christmas being a federal holiday or any mention of God on currency or in the Pledge of Allegiance.

===Atheist monument===
In May 2013 the American Atheists settled with Bradford County, Florida, regarding a monument containing the Ten Commandments. The American Atheists would be allowed to place their own monument onto public property. This marked the first time that such a monument was placed on public land. The monument is being furnished by American Atheists via a grant from the Stiefel Freethought Foundation.

===Billboards===
The American Atheists organization is known for its controversial antireligious billboards, intended by the organization to draw out closeted atheists within religious groups. A billboard on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway displaying the Hebrew Tetragrammaton erected after the celebration of the Jewish holy day of Purim caused outrage from many Jews. The same billboard was rejected by a landowner in an Orthodox Jewish neighborhood, which drew a reaction from American Atheists&#x27; president David Silverman, who stated that this was a case of religious bigotry. 

A satirical billboard depicting the Nativity during the Christmas season was also erected in 2010, causing a reaction from many American Christians, including the construction of a counter-billboard by the Catholic League. A billboard in Paterson, New Jersey, with the name of Allah in Arabic and the words &quot;You know it&#x27;s a myth and you have a choice&quot; drew criticism from local Muslims who &quot;felt it was disrespectful and insulting but they agreed that the American Atheists have the right to put up their billboards where they want.&quot;

===AtheistTV===
On July 29, 2014, at a New York launch party, the group revealed an Internet television channel on the Roku streaming media platform, showing a 24-hour live stream of programming alongside an on-demand service. The President of American Atheists, David Silverman, explained that the new channel would &quot;...provide a breadth of content, from science to politics to comedy, all centered around our common freedom from religion.&quot; AtheistTV became only the second atheist channel on Roku, but it was the first atheist channel with both live and on-demand video content. Roku hosts over 400 religious channels.

<doc id="412870" wikidata="Q6942136" url="?curid=412870" title="Music of Kentucky">
<text>The Music of Kentucky is heavily centered on Appalachian folk music and its descendants, especially in eastern Kentucky. Bluegrass music is of particular regional importance; Bill Monroe, &quot;the father of bluegrass music&quot;, was born in the Ohio County community of Rosine, and he named his band, the Blue Grass Boys, after the bluegrass state, i.e., Kentucky. Travis picking, the influential guitar style, is named after Merle Travis, born and raised in Muhlenberg County. Kentucky is home to the Country Music Highway (Highway 23), which extends from Portsmouth, Ohio, to the Virginia border in Pike County.

==Music venues and institutions==
Renfro Valley (near Richmond) is home to Renfro Valley Entertainment Center and the Kentucky Music Hall of Fame and is known as &quot;Kentucky&#x27;s Country Music Capital&quot;, a designation given it by the Kentucky State Legislature in the late 1980s. The Renfro Valley Barn Dance was where Renfro Valley&#x27;s musical heritage began, in 1939, and influential country music luminaries like Red Foley, Homer &amp; Jethro, Lily May Ledford &amp; the Original Coon Creek Girls, Martha Carson, and many others have performed as regular members of the shows there over the years. The Renfro Valley Gatherin&#x27; is today America&#x27;s second oldest continually broadcast radio program of any kind. It is broadcast on local radio station WRVK and a syndicated network of nearly 200 other stations across the United States and Canada every week.

Major music venues in Kentucky include the Paramount Arts Center in Ashland. There is also Sturgill&#x27;s Music Center in Tom T. Hall&#x27;s hometown of Olive Hill. Just south of Olive Hill is Sandy Hook, the boyhood home of Keith Whitley, whose house is now a museum, exhibited in conjunction with the annual Tobacco Festival. The Kentucky Opry in Prestonsburg is a major institution, using the Mountain Arts Center. Louisville is home to the West Point Country Opry, while the city of Owensboro is a major bluegrass center, and is home to the International Bluegrass Music Association. In the capital city, Frankfort, there is the Kentucky Coffeetree Cafe. The cafe is an intimate venue that features some of the top national and regional bluegrass, Americana and folk artists. The Rosemary Clooney House in Augusta pays homage to the life and career of this favorite daughter of Maysville.

==Festivals==
Singers gather annually at Benton on the fourth Sunday in May to sing from a shape note hymn and tune book called The Southern Harmony, and Musical Companion. This event, first organized in 1884 and called &quot;The Big Singing&quot; or &quot;Big Singing Day&quot;, is considered by many to be the oldest indigenous musical tradition in the United States. It was organized by James Roberts Lemon, a newspaper owner and publisher in western Kentucky.

Ashland is also home to the Summer Motion festival and Poage Landing Days, while Olive Hill also hosts the International Strange Music Weekend and the Shriner&#x27;s Bluegrass Festival. The Renfro Valley Barn Dance has been held in Renfro Valley since 1939. Owensboro has the last part of June every year. Other festivals include the Forkland Heritage Festival and Revue in Gravel Switch.

Lexington is host to the oldest bluegrass music festival in the state. The Festival of the Bluegrass is held every June at the Kentucky Horse Park and considered one of the premier traditional bluegrass festivals in the country.

Wilmore, Kentucky is home to the Ichthus Music Festival. Ichthus is a Christian music festival held each year on the Ichthus Farm. Notable bands such as Switchfoot, Relient K, Pillar, and P.O.D. have all played at past Ichthus festivals.

Mount Sterling is home to the Gateway Music Festival.

Boomslang: A Celebration of Sound &amp; Art is an annual multi-venue music festival in Lexington, sponsored by the University of Kentucky&#x27;s college radio station, WRFL. The festival is an extension of WRFL&#x27;s mission to provide a platform for non-mainstream, non-commercial music and other programming not found elsewhere in the region, featuring a variety of artists from both the region and from around the world. Genres tend to be experimental in nature, but have included everything from alternative rock, post-rock, electronic, hip hop, punk rock, metal, and psychedelic rock bands. Other festival features have included dance performances, local craft booths, fashion and art installations, workshops, literary events and film screenings, with a special focus on the artists and arts organizers that make Lexington unique.

Louisville hosts the Forecastle Festival each July since 2002, which has featured Louisville&#x27;s My Morning Jacket, Bowling Green&#x27;s Cage the Elephant, and Lexington&#x27;s Sturgill Simpson. The Forecastle Festival features a Kentucky Bourbon Lodge.

==History==

In the 1830s, a Great Awakening of fervent Christianity began, leading to popular spiritual song traditions. During this period, the country was undergoing a religious revival that was centered on itinerant preachers called circuit riders, and outdoor worship gatherings (camp meetings) where hymns (camp songs) were sung. Earlier in the century, the first camp meeting was held in July 1800 in Logan County. In 1801, a meeting in Cane Ridge in Bourbon County lasted for six days and attracted ten to twenty thousand people.

In 1916, Loraine Wyman and Howard Brockway collected Kentucky folk music which they published in two folios:
*&quot;Lonesome Tunes: Folk Songs from the Kentucky Mountains&quot; (1917, New York)
*&quot;Twenty Kentucky Mountain Songs&quot; (1920, Boston).

Louisville is known for producing some of the earliest jug band music, and celebrates the fact with the annual National Jug Band Jubilee in mid-September.

<text>The brown trout (Salmo trutta) is a species of salmonid ray-finned fish and the most widely distributed species of the genus &quot;Salmo&quot;, endemic to most of Europe, West Asia and parts of North Africa, and has been widely introduced globally as a game fish, even becoming one of the world&#x27;s worst invasive species outside of its native range.

Brown trout are highly adaptable and have evolved numerous ecotypes/subspecies. These include three main ecotypes: a riverine ecotype called river trout or &quot;Salmo trutta&quot; morpha &quot;fario&quot;; a lacustrine ecotype or &quot;S. trutta&quot; morpha &quot;lacustris&quot;, also called the lake trout (not to be confused with the lake trout in North America); and anadromous populations known as the [[sea trout]] or &quot;S. trutta&quot; morpha &quot;trutta&quot;, which upon adulthood migrate downstream to the oceans for much of its life and only returns to fresh water to spawn in the gravel beds of headstreams. Sea trout in Ireland and Great Britain have many regional names: &quot;sewin&quot; in Wales, &quot;finnock&quot; in Scotland, &quot;peal&quot; in the West Country, &quot;mort&quot; in North West England, and &quot;white trout&quot; in Ireland.

The lacustrine and riverine morphs of brown trout are both potamodromous, meaning they are also migratory, though only between freshwater bodies. Lacustrine trout mainly inhabit large lakes with calm and stratified deep water, while riverine trout forms fluvial populations typically in large rivers but sometimes in shallower creeks and alpine streams, both still migrating upstream during reproductive seasons. Anadromous and potamodromous morphs coexisting in the same river appear genetically identical. What determines whether they migrate to sea or not remains unknown.

== Taxonomy ==
The scientific name of the brown trout is &quot;Salmo trutta&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;trutta&quot; derives from the Latin &quot;trutta&quot;, meaning, literally, &quot;trout&quot;. Behnke (2007) relates that the brown trout was the first species of trout described in the 1758 edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus. &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; established the system of binomial nomenclature for animals. &quot;Salmo trutta&quot; was used to describe anadromous or sea-run forms of brown trout. Linnaeus also described two other brown trout species in 1758. &quot;Salmo fario&quot; was used for riverine forms. &quot;Salmo lacustris&quot; was used for lake-dwelling forms.

== Range ==

The native range of brown trout extends from northern Norway and White Sea tributaries in Russia in the Arctic Ocean to the Atlas Mountains in North Africa. The western limit of their native range is Iceland in the north Atlantic, while the eastern limit is in Aral Sea tributaries in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

===Introduction outside their natural range===
Brown trout have been widely introduced into suitable environments around the world, including North and South America, Australasia, Asia, and South and East Africa. Introduced brown trout have established self-sustaining, wild populations in many introduced countries. The first introductions were in Australia in 1864 when 300 of 1500 brown trout eggs from the River Itchen survived a four-month voyage from Falmouth, Cornwall to Melbourne on the sailing ship &quot;Norfolk&quot;. By 1866, 171 young brown trout were surviving in a Plenty River hatchery in Tasmania. Thirty-eight young trout were released in the river, a tributary of the River Derwent in 1866. By 1868, the Plenty River hosted a self-sustaining population of brown trout which became a brood source for continued introduction of brown trout into Australian and New Zealand rivers. Successful introductions into the Natal and Cape Provinces of South Africa took place in 1890 and 1892, respectively. By 1909, brown trout were established in the mountains of Kenya. The first introductions into the Himalayas in northern India took place in 1868, and by 1900, brown trout were established in Kashmir and Madras. In the 1950s and 1960s, , a French geologist, began the introduction of several species of salmonids on the remote Kerguelen Islands in the southern Indian Ocean. Of the seven species introduced, only brook trout, &quot;Salvelinus fontinalis&quot;, and brown trout survived to establish wild populations.

=== Introduction to Americas ===
The first introductions in Canada occurred in 1883 in Newfoundland and continued until 1933. The only Canadian regions without brown trout are Yukon and the Northwest Territories. Introductions into South America began in 1904 in Argentina. Brown trout are now established in Chile, Peru and the Falklands. Sea-run forms of brown trout exceeding are caught by local anglers on a regular basis.
The first introductions into the U.S. started in 1883 when Fred Mather, a New York pisciculturist and angler, under the authority of the U.S. Fish Commissioner, Spencer Baird, obtained brown trout eggs from a Baron Lucius von Behr, president of the . The von Behr brown trout came from both mountain streams and large lakes in the Black Forest region of Baden-Württemberg. The original shipment of &quot;von Behr&quot; brown trout eggs were handled by three hatcheries, one on Long Island, the Cold Spring Hatchery operated by Mather, one in Caledonia, New York, operated by pisciculturalist Seth Green, and other hatchery in Northville, Michigan. Additional shipments of &quot;von Behr&quot; brown trout eggs arrived in 1884. In 1885, brown trout eggs from Loch Leven, Scotland, arrived in New York. These &quot;Loch Leven&quot; brown trout were distributed to the same hatcheries. Over the next few years, additional eggs from Scotland, England, and Germany were shipped to U.S. hatcheries. Behnke (2007) believed all life forms of brown trout—anadromous, riverine, and lacustrine—were imported into the U.S. and intermingled genetically to create what he calls the American generic brown trout and a single subspecies the North European brown trout (&quot;S. t. trutta&quot;).

In April 1884, the U.S. Fish Commission released 4900 brown trout fry into the Baldwin River, a tributary of the Pere Marquette River in Michigan. This was the first release of brown trout into U.S. waters. Between 1884 and 1890, brown trout were introduced into suitable habitats throughout the U.S. By 1900, 38 states and two territories had received stocks of brown trout. Their adaptability resulted in most of these introductions establishing wild, self-sustaining populations.

== Conservation status ==

The fish is not considered to be endangered, although some individual stocks are under various degrees of stress mainly through habitat degradation, overfishing, and artificial propagation leading to introgression. Increased frequency of excessively warm water temperatures in high summer causes a reduction in dissolved oxygen levels which can cause &quot;summer kills&quot; of local populations if temperatures remain high for sufficient duration and deeper/cooler or fast, turbulent more oxygenated water is not accessible to the fish. This phenomenon can be further exacerbated by eutrophication of rivers due to pollution—often from the use of agricultural fertilizers within the drainage basin.

Overfishing is a problem where anglers fail to identify and return mature female fish into the lake or stream. Each large female removed can result in thousands fewer eggs released back into the system when the remaining fish spawn.

In small streams, brown trout are important predators of macroinvertebrates, and declining brown trout populations in these specific areas affect the entire aquatic food web.

Global climate change is also of concern. &quot;S. trutta&quot; morpha &quot;fario&quot; prefers well-oxygenated water in the temperature range of . &quot;S. trutta&quot; bones from an archaeological site in Italy, and ancient DNA extracted from some of these bones, indicate that both abundance and genetic diversity increased markedly during the colder Younger Dryas period, and fell during the warmer Bølling-Allerød event.

Cover or structure is important to trout, and they are more likely to be found near submerged rocks and logs, undercut banks, and overhanging vegetation. Structure provides protection from predators, bright sunlight, and higher water temperatures. Access to deep water for protection in winter freezes, or fast water for protection from low oxygen levels in summer are also ideal. Trout are more often found in heavy and strong currents.

== Characteristics ==

Defining characteristics include a slender body with a long, narrow head. The mouth is large, and on its roof, vomerine teeth are developed in a zig-zag pattern. The caudal fin is deltaform without forking, unlike that of the related Atlantic salmon (&quot;Salmo salar&quot;). Dark and red spots are often present on the sides, but do not extend to the tail. Parr trout (juvenile) often have a red margin on their adipose fin, with dark blotches along their sides that also become inconspicuous with age.

Freshwater brown trout range in colour from largely silver with relatively few spots and a white belly, to the more well-known brassy reddish-brown cast fading to creamy white on the fish&#x27;s belly, with medium-sized spots surrounded by lighter halos. The more silver forms can be mistaken for rainbow trout. Regional variants include the so-called &quot;Loch Leven&quot; trout, distinguished by larger fins, a slimmer body, and heavy black spotting, but lacking red spots. The continental European strain features a lighter golden cast with some red spotting and fewer dark spots. Notably, both strains can show considerable individual variation from this general description. Early stocking efforts in the United States used fish taken from Scotland and Germany.



The brown trout is a medium-sized fish, growing to or more and a length of about in some localities, although in many smaller rivers, a mature weight of or less is common. &quot;S. t. lacustris&quot; reaches an average length of with a maximum length of and about .

On September 11, 2009, a 41.45-lb (18.80-kg) brown trout was caught by Tom Healy in the Manistee River system in Michigan, setting a new state record. As of late December 2009, the fish captured by Healy was confirmed by both the International Game Fish Association and the Fresh Water Fishing Hall of Fame as the new all-tackle world record for the species. This fish, which supplanted the former world record from the Little Red River in Arkansas, has in turn been exceeded by a specimen caught in the Ohau Canal in Twizel, New Zealand on 27 October 2020. The all-tackle length IGFA world record is a fish caught in Milwaukee Harbor, Wisconsin on 16 December 2011.
The spawning behaviour of brown trout is similar to that of the closely related Atlantic salmon. A typical female produces about 2,000 eggs per kg (900 eggs per lb) of body weight at spawning.

Brown trout can live 20 years, but as with the Atlantic salmon, a high proportion of males die after spawning, and probably fewer than 20% of anadromous female kelts recover from spawning . The migratory forms grow to significantly larger sizes for their age due to abundant forage fish in the waters where they spend most of their lives. Sea trout are more commonly female in less nutrient-rich rivers. Brown trout are active both by day and by night and are opportunistic feeders. While in freshwater, their diets frequently include invertebrates from the streambed, other fish, frogs, mice, birds, and insects flying near the water&#x27;s surface. The high dietary reliance upon insect larvae, pupae, nymphs, and adults allows trout to be a favoured target for fly fishing. Sea trout are fished for especially at night using wet flies. Brown trout can be caught with lures such as spoons, spinners, jigs, plugs, plastic worm imitations, and live or dead baitfish.

Brown trout rarely form hybrids with other species; if they do, they are almost invariably infertile. One such example is the tiger trout, a hybrid with the brook trout.

== Diet ==
Field studies have demonstrated that brown trout fed on several animal prey species, aquatic invertebrates being the most abundant prey items. However, brown trout also feed on other taxa such as terrestrial invertebrates (e.g. Hymenoptera) or other fish. Moreover, in brown trout, as in many other fish species, a change in the diet composition normally occurs during the life of the fish, and piscivorous behaviour is most frequent in large brown trout. These shifts in the diet during fish lifecycle transitions may be accompanied by a marked reduction in intraspecific competition in the fish population, facilitating the partitioning of resources.

First feeding of newly emerged fry is very important for brown trout survival in this phase of the lifecycle, and first feeding can occur even prior to emergence. Fry start to feed before complete yolk absorption and the diet composition of newly emerged brown trout is composed of small prey such as chironomid larvae or baetid nymphs.

== Stocking, farming and non-native brown trout ==
The species has been widely introduced for sport fishing into North America, South America, Australia, New Zealand, and many other countries, including Bhutan, where they are the focus of a specialised fly fishery. The first planting in the United States occurred on April 11, 1884, into the Baldwin River, one mile east of Baldwin, Michigan. Brown trout have had serious negative impacts on upland native fish species in some of the countries where they have been introduced, particularly Australia. In Chile, Australia, New Zealand and other locations in the southern hemisphere, brown trout compete with fish from the family Galaxiidae, which also have affinity for well-oxygenated, cold streams. Brown trout additionally are voracious predators of invertebrates and can carry microbial pathogens like &quot;Aeromonas salmonicida&quot;. Genetic background is a very important factor when determining the success of trout populations, this information is vital to restore and enhance previous populations. Because of the trout&#x27;s importance as a food and game fish, it has been artificially propagated and stocked in many places in its range, and fully natural populations (uncontaminated by allopatric genomes) probably exist only in isolated places, for example in Corsica or in high alpine valleys on the European mainland.

Farming of brown trout has included the production of infertile triploid fish by increasing the water temperature just after fertilisation of eggs, or more reliably, by a process known as pressure shocking. Triploids are favoured by anglers because they grow faster and larger than diploid trout. Proponents of stocking triploids argue, because they are infertile, they can be introduced into an environment that contains wild brown trout without the negative effects of cross-breeding. However, stocking triploids may damage wild stocks in other ways. Triploids certainly compete with diploid fish for food, space, and other resources. They could also be more aggressive than diploid fish and they may disturb spawning behaviour.

== Angling ==
The brown trout has been a popular game fish of European anglers for centuries. It was first mentioned in angling literature as &quot;fish with speckled skins&quot; by Roman author Aelian (&quot;circa&quot; 200 AD) in &quot;On the Nature of Animals&quot;. This work is credited with describing the first instance of fly fishing for trout, the trout being the brown trout found in Macedonia. The &quot;Treatyse of Fysshynge with an Angle&quot; (1496) by Dame Juliana Berners, O.S.B is considered a foundational work in the history of recreational fishing, especially fly fishing. One of the most prominent fish described in the work is the brown trout of English rivers and streams:

The renowned &quot;The Compleat Angler&quot; (1653) by Izaak Walton is replete with advice on &quot;the trout&quot;:

Throughout the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, angling authors, mostly British, some French, and later American, writing about trout fishing were writing about fishing for brown trout. Once brown trout were introduced into the U.S. in the 1880s, they became a major subject of American angling literature. In 1889, Frederic M. Halford, a British angler, author published &quot;Dry-Fly Fishing in Theory and Practice&quot;, a seminal work codifying a half century of evolution of fly fishing with floating flies for brown trout. In the late 19th century, American angler and writer Theodore Gordon, often called the &quot;Father of American Dry Fly Fishing&quot;, perfected dry-fly techniques for the newly arrived, but difficult-to-catch brown trout in Catskill rivers such as the Beaverkill and Neversink Rivers. In the early 20th century, British angler and author G. E. M. Skues pioneered nymphing techniques for brown trout on English chalk streams. His &quot;Minor Tactics of the Chalk Stream&quot; (1910) began a revolution in fly fishing techniques for trout. In 1917, Scottish author Hamish Stuart published the first comprehensive text, &quot;The Book of The Sea Trout&quot;, specifically addressing angling techniques for the anadromous forms of brown trout.

Introductions of brown trout into the American West created new angling opportunities, none so successful from an angling perspective as was the introduction of browns into the upper Firehole River in Yellowstone National Park in 1890. One of the earliest accounts of trout fishing in the park is from Mary Trowbridge Townsend&#x27;s 1897 article in&quot; Outing Magazine&quot; &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Trout Fishing in Yellowstone Park&quot; in which she talks about catching the von Behr trout in the river:

Within the US, brown trout introductions have created self-sustaining fisheries throughout the country. Many are considered &quot;world-class&quot; such as in the Great Lakes and in several Arkansas tailwaters. Outside the U.S. and outside its native range in Europe, introduced brown trout have created &quot;world-class&quot; fisheries in New Zealand, Patagonia, and the Falklands.

<text>Rita Moreno (born Rosa Dolores Alverío Marcano; December 11, 1931) is an American actress, dancer, and singer. With a career spanning eight decades she is known for her roles on stage and screen, and is one of the last remaining stars from the Golden Age of Hollywood. Among her numerous accolades, she is one of the few actors to have been awarded an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar, and a Tony (EGOT) and the Triple Crown of Acting. She has been honored with Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2004, the National Medal of Arts in 2009, the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award in 2013, the Kennedy Center Honor in 2015, and a Peabody Award in 2019. 

Moreno&#x27;s early work included supporting roles in the classic musical films &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; (1952) and &quot;The King and I&quot; (1956), before her breakout role as Anita in &quot;West Side Story&quot; (1961), which earned her the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, becoming the first Latin American woman to win an Academy Award. Moreno returned in the supporting role of Valentina in the 2021 Spielberg-directed remake of the same name. Her other films include &quot;Popi&quot; (1969), &quot;Carnal Knowledge&quot; (1971), &quot;The Four Seasons&quot; (1981), &quot;I Like It Like That&quot; (1994), &quot;Slums of Beverly Hills&quot; (1998), and &quot;Fast X&quot; (2023). 

In theater, she starred as Googie Gomez in the 1975 Terrence McNally musical &quot;The Ritz&quot; earning her the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical. She reprised her role in the 1976 film directed by Richard Lester which earned her a BAFTA Award for Best Actress nomination. She also acted in Lorraine Hansberry&#x27;s &quot;The Sign in Sidney Brustein&#x27;s Window&quot; in 1964 and in Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; in 1985. 

She was a cast member in &quot;The Electric Company&quot; (1971-1977), for which she earned an Emmy in 1972, and played Sister Peter Marie Reimondo on the HBO series &quot;Oz&quot; (1997-2003). She received two consecutive Primetime Emmy Awards for her roles on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; in 1977 and &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; in 1978. She acted in &quot;Where on Earth Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot; (1994-1999), The CW series &quot;Jane the Virgin&quot; (2015–2019), and the Netflix revival of &quot;One Day at a Time&quot; (2017–2020). Her life was profiled in &quot;Rita Moreno: Just a Girl Who Decided to Go for It&quot; (2021).

==Early years==
Moreno was born in a Humacao, Puerto Rico hospital to Rosa María (née Marcano), (1912-1999) a seamstress who was born in 1912, and Francisco José &quot;Paco&quot; Alverío, a farmer who was born in 1908. She was nicknamed &quot;Rosita&quot; and raised in nearby Juncos. Her maternal grandparents were Justino Marcano (b. Puerto Rico) and Trinidad from Spain. Moreno&#x27;s mother moved to New York City in 1936, taking her daughter, but not her son, Moreno&#x27;s younger brother, Francisco, whom Moreno would not see again until 2021. Moreno adopted the surname of her first stepfather, Edward Moreno, Rosa Maria&#x27;s second husband. She spent her teenage years living in the NYC suburb of Valley Stream on Long Island.

==Career==
===1945–1959: Theater debut and early films ===

Moreno began her first dancing lessons soon after arriving in New York with a Spanish dancer known as &quot;Paco Cansino&quot;, who was a paternal uncle of film star Rita Hayworth. When she was 11 years old, she lent her voice to Spanish-language versions of American films. She had her first Broadway role, as &quot;Angelina&quot; in the 1945 production of &quot;Skydrift&quot;, by the age of 13, which caught the attention of Hollywood talent scouts. Moreno said she was raped by her agent while she was a teen actor.

Moreno&#x27;s film career began in the later years of the Golden Age of Hollywood. Moreno and her mother moved to a Culver City &quot;cottage&quot; within walking distance of MGM. She acted steadily in films throughout the 1950s, usually in small roles, including in &quot;The Toast of New Orleans&quot; (1950) In 1952, she appeared in Stanley Donen&#x27;s musical comedy film &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; alongside Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds and Donald O&#x27;Connor. In the film she played silent film star Zelda Zanders. She described having gotten the role by Gene Kelly &quot;wanting her in the movie&quot; and that she &quot;seemed to fit the role for him&quot;. Moreno praised Kelly for casting her in a non-stereotypical Hispanic role playing Zelda saying, &quot;he never said &#x27;Oh she&#x27;s too Latina&#x27;, he just thought I&#x27;d be fine for it&quot;. She called the experience working in the film as an &quot;amazing experience&quot; and a &quot;privilege&quot;.

In March 1954, Moreno was featured on the cover of &quot;Life&quot; magazine with the caption &quot;Rita Moreno: An Actress&#x27;s Catalog of Sex and Innocence&quot;. Moreno disliked most of her film work during this period, as she felt the roles she was given were very stereotypical. One exception was her supporting role in the film version of Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;The King and I&quot; directed by Walter Lang. In the film she played Tuptim, a slave brought from Burma to be one of the King&#x27;s junior wives. She starred alongside Yul Brynner and Deborah Kerr. The film was a critical and financial success. It received nine Academy Award nominations including five wins including Best Actor, Best Art Direction - Color, Best Costume Design - Color, Best Original Score, and Best Sound Recording. In 1959, Moreno appeared as Lola Montez in Season 3, Episode 23, of the TV western &quot;Tales of Wells Fargo&quot;, episode title &quot;Lola Montez&quot;.

=== 1960–1969: Breakout with &quot;West Side Story&quot; ===
In 1961, Moreno landed the role of Anita in Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins&#x27; film adaptation of Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s and Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s groundbreaking Broadway musical &quot;West Side Story&quot;, which had been played by Chita Rivera on Broadway. Moreno earned acclaim for her performance. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Moreno&#x27;s performance full of &quot;spitfire&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;Moreno...presents a fiery characterization and also scores hugely&quot;. The film went on to win ten Academy Awards including for Best Picture. Moreno won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for that role.

After winning the Oscar, Moreno thought she would be able to continue to perform less stereotypical film roles, but was disappointed:

Moreno had a major role in &quot;Summer and Smoke&quot; (1961), released soon after &quot;West Side Story&quot;. She did appear in one film during her self-imposed exile from Hollywood – &quot;Cry of Battle&quot; (1963) – although it had been filmed directly before and after she won the Academy Award. She made her return to film in &quot;The Night of the Following Day&quot; (1968) with Marlon Brando, and followed that with &quot;Popi&quot; (1969), and &quot;Marlowe&quot; (1969) with James Garner. Moreno&#x27;s Broadway credits include &quot;Last of the Red Hot Lovers&quot; (1969), the musical &quot;Gantry&quot; (1970), and &quot;The Ritz&quot;, for which she won the 1975 Tony Award for Best Featured Actress. She appeared in the female version of &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; that ran in Chicago, for which she won the Sarah Siddons Award in 1985. Her costar Struthers later stated in an interview on &quot;Gilbert Gottfried&#x27;s Amazing Colossal Podcast&quot; that it was an unpleasant experience until Rita Moreno, who Struthers alleges was mean-spirited towards her, left the play and was replaced by Brenda Vaccaro.

=== 1970–1999: Established actress ===

From 1971 to 1977, Moreno was a main cast member on the PBS children&#x27;s series &quot;The Electric Company&quot;. She screamed the show&#x27;s opening line, &quot;Hey, you guys!&quot; Her roles on the show included Millie the Helper, the naughty little girl Pandora, and Otto, a very short-tempered director. Moreno also starred in Mike Nichols&#x27; &quot;Carnal Knowledge&quot; (1971) alongside Jack Nicholson, Candice Bergen, Ann-Margret, and Art Garfunkel. In the film she plays a prostitute named Louise, whom Jack Nicholson plays cards with. The film was a critical success. In 1976 she starred as Googie Gomez in Richard Lester&#x27;s film adaptation of the comedy farce &quot;The Ritz&quot; alongside Jack Weston, Jerry Stiller, and F. Murray Abraham. Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the film made the transition from the stage &quot;surprisingly well, given the odds,&quot; with &quot;two of the most flamboyantly entertaining and skillful comedy performances of the year&quot; by Jack Weston and Rita Moreno.

Moreno&#x27;s appearance on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; earned her a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program in 1977. As a result, she became the third person (after Richard Rodgers and Helen Hayes) to have won an Oscar (1962), a Grammy (1972), a Tony (1975), and an Emmy (1977), frequently referred to as an &quot;EGOT&quot;. She won another Emmy award the following year, 1978, this time a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress - Drama Series, for her portrayal of former call girl Rita Kapcovic on a three-episode arc on &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;.

In the 1980s Moreno starred as Lucille in Richard Benner&#x27;s comedy-drama film &quot;Happy Birthday, Gemini&quot; alongside Madeline Kahn. She was in Alan Alda&#x27;s &quot;The Four Seasons&quot; (1981) which was a financial and critical hit and starred Alda, Carol Burnett, Len Cariou, Sandy Dennis, and Jack Weston. She was a regular on the three-season network run of &quot;9 to 5&quot;, a sitcom based on the film hit, during the early 1980s. Rita Moreno has made numerous guest appearances on television series in the 1980s, including &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, and &quot;Miami Vice&quot;.

In 1993, Moreno was invited to perform at President Bill Clinton&#x27;s inauguration and later that month was asked to perform at the White House. During the mid-1990s, Moreno provided the voice of Carmen Sandiego on Fox&#x27;s animated series &quot;Where on Earth Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot; In the franchise&#x27;s 2019 animated series, Moreno voices the character Cookie Booker. In the late 1990s, Moreno played Sister Pete, a nun trained as a psychologist in the popular HBO series &quot;Oz&quot;, for which she won several ALMA Awards. She made a guest appearance on &quot;The Nanny&quot; as Coach Stone, Maggie&#x27;s tyrannical gym teacher, whom Fran Fine also remembered from her school as Ms. Wickavich.

=== 2000s–2010s ===

She released an eponymous album of nightclub songs in 2000 on the Varèse Sarabande label, with liner notes by Michael Feinstein.
In 2006, she portrayed Amanda Wingfield in Berkeley Repertory Theatre&#x27;s revival of &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot;.
She had a recurring role on &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; as the dying mother of Detective Robert Goren. She played the family matriarch on the 2007 TV series &quot;Cane&quot;, which starred Jimmy Smits and Hector Elizondo. She played the mother of Fran Drescher&#x27;s character in the 2011–13 TV sitcom &quot;Happily Divorced&quot;.

Since then, she has continued to work in film, including a small voice role in the 2014 film &quot;Rio 2&quot;, perhaps her most commercially successful film. In September 2011, Moreno began performing a solo autobiographical show at the Berkeley Repertory Theatre, &quot;Rita Moreno: Life Without Makeup&quot; written by the theatre&#x27;s artistic director Tony Taccone after hours of interviews with Moreno. In 2014, Moreno appeared in the NBC television film &quot;Old Soul&quot;, alongside Natasha Lyonne, Fred Willard and Ellen Burstyn. The film was intended as a pilot for a television series, but it was not picked up.

Moreno plays the matriarch of a Cuban-American family in the Netflix sitcom &quot;One Day at a Time&quot;, a remake produced by Norman Lear of Lear&#x27;s 1975–84 sitcom. The first season premiered in January 2017. Critics overall praised the show, and especially the performances of Moreno and the series&#x27; star, Justina Machado. Also that year, Moreno and others contributed to Lin-Manuel Miranda&#x27;s single &quot;Almost Like Praying&quot; where proceeds from the song went to the Hispanic Federation&#x27;s UNIDOS Disaster Relief program to benefit those affected by Hurricane Maria that devastated the island of Puerto Rico.

=== 2020s ===
In 2020–21, Moreno starred in and executive-produced the Steven Spielberg–directed adaptation of &quot;West Side Story&quot;. Moreno plays a newly created character, Valentina; she famously won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for playing Anita in the 1961 original movie. The film was released on December 10, 2021. Justin Chang of &quot;NPR&quot; wrote, &quot;Sixty years later, Moreno is an executive producer on Spielberg&#x27;s West Side Story. She also gives a poignant performance in the new role of Valentina, the widow of Doc, the drugstore owner. By her presence, Moreno teaches us how to approach this movie, as both an affectionate tribute and a gentle corrective.&quot;
On August 29, 2021, Moreno took part in the &quot;&quot;Wicked&quot; in Concert&quot; special on PBS, PBS.org and the PBS Video App, performing &quot;The Wizard and I&quot;.

Moreno&#x27;s life was profiled in the feature documentary entitled &quot;Rita Moreno: Just a Girl Who Decided to Go for It&quot; which was produced by Lin-Manuel Miranda. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and received positive reviews. &quot;The Guardian&quot; declared, &quot;Overall, she emerges just as vampish, feisty and fun as you’d expect, and as a gracious giver of speeches at ceremonies where she collects endless lifetime achievement awards&quot;.

In 2023, Moreno starred in the sports comedy &quot;80 for Brady&quot; about four elderly women who travel to see Tom Brady and the New England Patriots play at the Super Bowl LI. Moreno co-starred alongside Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, and Sally Field, and played Abuelita Toretto, the grandmother of Dom (Vin Diesel), Jakob (John Cena), and Mia (Jordana Brewster) in &quot;Fast X&quot;, the tenth installment of the &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot; franchise. Moreno played Angelica in &quot;Family Switch&quot;.

==Personal life==
From 1954 to 1962, Moreno was in an on-and-off relationship with Marlon Brando. She revealed in her memoir that she became pregnant by Brando and he arranged for an abortion. The abortion was botched, she went home and bled as the fetus died inside her and she had to be rushed to the hospital to have it surgically removed. Soon after, Brando fell in love with his co-star on &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot;, yet returned to her; Moreno attempted suicide by overdosing on Brando&#x27;s sleeping pills.
In 1965, Moreno married cardiologist and internist Leonard Gordon, who became her manager after he retired from medicine. In 1995, they relocated to Berkeley, California. They remained together until his death in 2010. Moreno and Gordon have one daughter, Fernanda Gordon Fisher, and two grandsons. Moreno said she once considered leaving her husband, but did not to avoid breaking up the family.

<doc id="412887" wikidata="Q6949150" url="?curid=412887" title="Mythica">
<text>Mythica was a never-released massively multiplayer online role-playing game (or &quot;MMORPG&quot;) based on Norse mythology. It was under development by Microsoft Game Studios (MGS) for Windows-running PCs until it was cancelled in early 2004. The game had been under development for over two years and had a development staff of forty at the time of cancellation.

As with most MMORPGs, one would have needed to purchase the game software and then subscribe to the game service, paying a monthly fee. The combat design was centered on being a demi-god, including the ability to swat waves of enemies aside to focus on their boss.

==Lawsuit==
In December 2003, Microsoft was sued for trademark infringement and unfair competition by Mythic Entertainment, the developers of the competing MMORPG &quot;Dark Age of Camelot&quot;. Mythic claimed in the lawsuit that the terms &quot;Mythic&quot; and &quot;Mythica&quot; were so close as to cause consumer confusion, thus infringing on Mythic&#x27;s trademark.

On May 25, 2004, three months after the game was cancelled, Mythic Entertainment announced that the case was settled and that Microsoft agreed to not use the &quot;Mythica&quot; name on new online computer games and to not register it as a trademark. Also as part of the deal, Microsoft gave &quot;Mythica&quot;-related trademarks and domain names to Mythic.

==Cancellation==
Microsoft had begun promoting the game; the company had hosted a party at Gen Con for fans.

On February 12, 2004, MGS announced the cancellation of &quot;Mythica&quot;. Microsoft claimed the cancellation was not due to the lawsuit, and cited the competitive MMORPG market and a desire to not &quot;spread ourselves out over multiple MMORPG projects.&quot;

At the time, Microsoft operated &quot;Asheron&#x27;s Call&quot; and &quot;Asheron&#x27;s Call 2&quot;, and was planning to publish Brad McQuaid&#x27;s new MMORPG: &quot;&quot; for PC and &quot;True Fantasy Live Online&quot;, an anime-esque MMOG for the Xbox console. However, as with Mythica, the latter game was never released.

As a result of the decision, around forty positions at MGS were cut. Among those were executive producer Matt Wilson, senior designer Hal Milton and lead designer Joel Manners.

Some commentators said at the time that the cancellation was evidence that the (English language) massively multiplayer market had become saturated, though &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;, released in November 2004, subsequently became the most popular MMORPG in the West with over 3 million Western subscribers as of December 2007.

<doc id="412891" wikidata="Q6941988" url="?curid=412891" title="Music of Alabama">
<text>Alabama has played a central role in the development of both blues and country music. Appalachian folk music, fiddle music, gospel, spirituals, and polka have had local scenes in parts of Alabama. The Tuskegee Institute&#x27;s School of Music (established 1931), especially the Tuskegee Choir, is an internationally renowned institution. There are three major modern orchestras, the Mobile Symphony, the Alabama Symphony Orchestra and the Huntsville Symphony Orchestra; the last is the oldest continuously operating professional orchestra in the state, giving its first performance in 1955.

==State song==

The state song of Alabama is entitled &quot;Alabama&quot;. It was written by Julia Tutwiler and composed by Edna Gockel Gussen. It was adopted as the state song in 1931.

A State Senate bill (SB-458) was passed 32–1 in 2000 to move &quot;Alabama&quot; to the status of State Anthem, with &quot;Stars Fell On Alabama&quot;, a song written in 1933 whose most popular release was by Jimmy Buffett in 1972 becoming the new State Song, and &quot;My Home&#x27;s in Alabama&quot; (1980) by the Country group Alabama would become the State Ballad, but the bill failed in the State House.

Other grass roots efforts to make &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; (1974) by Lynyrd Skynyrd the state song have also failed, but the song&#x27;s potential official status made a comeback when the State Tourism Agency chose the song as the centerpiece of its 2008 marketing campaign.

==Recording studios==
Muscle Shoals, Alabama is renowned worldwide as one of the epicenters of the music industry, having been the birthplace of a number of classic recordings. The studios of the Muscle Shoals area (Florence, Sheffield, Muscle Shoals, and Tuscumbia) figure prominently in the history of rock, country and R&amp;B through the 1960s, 70s &amp; 80s. FAME Studios, Muscle Shoals Sound Studios, Wishbone Studios, Quinvy Studios, East Avalon Recorders/ClearDay Studio, and others have recorded local musicians and international superstars alike. Notable artists have included Aretha Franklin, Rolling Stones, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, Bob Dylan, Paul Simon, Rod Stewart, Willie Nelson, Hank Williams Jr, Roy Orbison, and countless others have recorded there. The notable studio house bands include The Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, The Swampers, The Muscle Shoals Horns, and The Fame Gang.

Though not as popular a recording center as before, Muscle Shoals continues to be an important contributor to American popular music and is home to a number of the world&#x27;s most successful songwriters, musicians and producers. Single Lock Records currently operates a recording studio, record label, and performance venue in the area.

The Hangout Music Festival (est. 2010) is an annual 3-day music festival held at the public beaches of Gulf Shores, Alabama.

==Halls of fame==

The Alabama Music Hall of Fame was created by the Alabama state legislature as a state agency in 1980. A 12,500 square foot (1,200 m²) exhibit hall opened in Tuscumbia in 1990.

The Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame (AJHoF) is located in Birmingham, housed in the historic Carver Theatre. It was founded in 1978 and opened a museum in 1993.

==Styles of music==
===Indigenous music===
===Soul/R&amp;B===
Many artists in the realms of rhythm and blues and soul music have emerged from Alabama over the past 50 years, including Wilson Pickett, Percy Sledge, Martha Reeves of Martha and the Vandellas. Rick Hall established FAME Studios. In 1966, Rick Hall helped license Percy Sledge&#x27;s &quot;When a Man Loves a Woman&quot;, produced by Quin Ivy, to Atlantic Records, which then led to a regular arrangement under which Atlantic would send musicians to Hall&#x27;s Muscle Shoals studio to record. The studio produced further hit records for Wilson Pickett, James &amp; Bobby Purify, Aretha Franklin, Clarence Carter, Arthur Conley, and Otis Redding enhancing Hall&#x27;s reputation as a white Southern producer who could produce and engineer hits for black Southern soul singers. He produced many sessions using guitarist Duane Allman. Dan Penn and Spooner Oldham wrote &quot;I&#x27;m Your Puppet&quot; for James &amp; Bobby Purify. Members of The Commodores are from Tuskegee.

===Rock/Pop===
Rock and pop musicians from Alabama are Southern rock/pop/R&amp;B band Wet Willie, the rock band Brother Cane, the power pop band Hotel of Birmingham, Bill McCorvey of the country band Pirates of the Mississippi, songwriter/producer Walt Aldridge, and Tommy Shaw of the rock band Styx. Dan Penn, from Alabama , worked with the Box Tops. The Birmingham area has had more than its fair share of &quot;American Idol&quot; contestants do well, including second season winner Ruben Studdard (who played football for Alabama A&amp;M University).

===Blues and Jazz===

WC Handy, often referred to as the &quot;father of the blues&quot;, was born and raised in Florence, Alabama, which since 1982 holds an annual WC Handy Music Festival &quot;to preserve, present, and promote the musical heritage of Northwest Alabama&quot;. The festival is usually held in the summer, and cake and other foods are typically served.

Piedmont and country blues singer, guitarist, and songwriter Ed Bell was born near Fort Deposit.

Though born in Frayser, a community in North Memphis, Tennessee, Johnny Shines, Blues singer and guitarist, moved to Holt, Alabama, in Tuscaloosa County, in 1969, where he lived until he died. Shines died on April 20, 1992, in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.[1] He was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame later the same year.

Alabama has a rich jazz heritage, being the birthplace of such greats as Erskine Hawkins, Nat King Cole, Cleveland Eaton, James Reese Europe, Cootie Williams, William Manuel Johnson, Urbie Green, Ward Swingle, Cow Cow Davenport, members of Take 6 and many more. Tubist Howard Johnson of the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; band hails from Montgomery. The museum of the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame honors many of these fine musicians. In the 1930s and 40s, college dance bands, such as the Alabama Cavaliers, the Auburn Knights and the Bama State Collegians played an important role in the history of jazz in the South. Birmingham, Alabama boasts several active big bands, including the SuperJazz Big Band, the Joe Giattina Orchestra, the Night Flight Big Band and the Magic City Jazz Orchestra, founded and directed by Ray Reach. In addition, there is a world-class horn section, the Tuscaloosa Horns, comprising some of Alabama&#x27;s finest jazz/soul/funk instrumentalists. Also the newest/youngest break out big band in Alabama which incorporates everything from Duke Ellington to Bob Marley; the New South Jazz Orchestra which prominently features the Tuscaloosa Horns and the composing/arranging skills of members of the Tuscaloosa Horns.

Ward Swingle, world-famous multiple Grammy Award-winning jazz vocal composer and pianist, hails from Mobile.

Birmingham contributed prominently to the history of jazz in America. It is the hometown of numerous influential jazz musicians, including bassist Cleveland Eaton, pianist and vocalist Ray Reach, guitarist Johnny Smith, trumpeter and bandleader Erskine Hawkins, trumpeter and arranger Tommy Stewart, trumpeter Nelson Williams, composer Hugh Martin, arranger Sammy Lowe, bandleader Sun Ra, vibraphonist and bandleader Lionel Hampton, singer and guitarist Odetta, John Propst (pianist for Pete Fountain and Boots Randolph) and many more. Historical areas such as Tuxedo Junction and the Fourth Avenue Historic District played an important role in the evolution of jazz in Birmingham and the United States.

===Gospel===
Gospel music has an especially long tradition in the state, among both the white and black populations. Given the strongly religious coloring of Alabama&#x27;s population historically, the genre is one example of many shared phenomena between the historically segregated cultures of the state. The two traditions are, however, distinct, and entail key distinctions, with Southern gospel incorporating elements of bluegrass and country music more strongly than &quot;black&quot; gospel.

===Celtic===
The state also has a Celtic music scene, which has produced bands like Henri&#x27;s Notions, After Class, and the Birmingham-based harpist Cynthia Douglass, as well as a number of piping bands and promotional Celtic organizations.

===Sacred Harp===
Alabama is the leading state for Sacred Harp singing. More annual singings are held in Alabama than in any other state. &quot;The Sacred Harp: Revised Cooper Edition&quot;, a version of &quot;The Sacred Harp&quot; used across the southern parts of Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Texas, is published by the Sacred Harp Book Company of Samson, Alabama. The Sacred Harp/Shape Note Music and Cultural Center is located in Bessemer, Alabama.

===Country, Bluegrass, and Old-time Music===
The State of Alabama has a rich history in country, bluegrass and old-time music. The influence of Mississippi Delta blues to the west and the ancient sounds of Appalachian Folk Music to the north blend with native Jazz sounds to form a brand of country music with a unique Alabama flavor. &quot;Country music may be recorded in Nashville, but it was born in the Heart of Dixie.&quot; (Will Vincent, Tall Pines Bluegrass).

North Alabama&#x27;s contribution to bluegrass music over the years has been exceptional. From former &quot;Bluegrass Boys&quot; Rual Yarbrough and Jake Landers, mandolin virtuoso Hershel Sizemore, fiddling legend Al Lester and the incomparable Claire Lynch, to modern day country-star-turned-bluegrass artist Marty Raybon, the list goes on and on.

Probably one of the most well-known musicians to ever hail from Alabama is Hank Williams Sr., born in Georgiana. Hank&#x27;s hits include &quot;I&#x27;m So Lonesome I Could Cry&quot;, &quot;Lost Highway&quot; and &quot;Jambalaya (On the Bayou)&quot;. Hank and his wife Audrey are both buried in Oakwood Cemetery in Montgomery where the Hank Williams Museum resides downtown. A section of Interstate 65 between Georgiana and Montgomery was commemorated the &quot;Lost Highway&quot; in memory of Williams in 1997.

Other notable residents include Jimmy Buffett, though born in Pascagoula, Mississippi, grew up in the Mobile area. Country star Tammy Wynette was born on the Mississippi/Alabama line. The Louvin Brothers were pioneers of tight harmony country and bluegrass vocalizations. Vern Gosdin is another influential country music legend who came from the state of Alabama. Emmylou Harris was born in Birmingham. Shenandoah from Muscle Shoals became major stars. The group Alabama from Fort Payne is often credited with bringing country music groups (as opposed to solo vocalists) into the mainstream, paving the way for the success of today&#x27;s top country groups.

<text>Texas are a Scottish rock band from Glasgow, founded in 1986 by Johnny McElhone (formerly of the bands Altered Images and Hipsway), Ally McErlaine, and Sharleen Spiteri (on lead vocals). Texas, despite their name, has no connection with the US state of Texas. Texas made their performing debut in March 1988 at the University of Dundee. The band released their debut album &quot;Southside&quot; in 1989, along with the debut single &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want a Lover&quot;, which was a top-ten hit on the UK Singles Chart and peaked within the top ten of the charts in many other European countries. &quot;Southside&quot; entered at number three on the UK Albums Chart and number 88 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart in the United States, and sold over two million copies worldwide. Despite the success of &quot;Southside&quot;, the follow-up albums &quot;Mothers Heaven&quot; (1991) and &quot;Ricks Road&quot; (1993) were less successful, peaking at number 32 and number 18 on the UK Albums Chart respectively, but achieved moderate success on various European markets.

The band&#x27;s fortunes changed in 1997 with the release of their &quot;White on Blonde&quot; album, which entered at the top of the UK albums chart and became their biggest seller. To date it has been certified six times platinum in the United Kingdom. Follow up album &quot;The Hush&quot; (1999) was also successful, entering at the top of the UK albums chart and certified triple platinum. The band&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album, released in 2000, was another big-seller, again entering at the top of the UK albums chart, and certified six times platinum. Texas would go on to release a further two studio albums, &quot;Careful What You Wish For&quot; in 2003, and &quot;Red Book&quot; in 2005, both of which were certified gold in the United Kingdom. After the release of &quot;Red Book&quot; and a tour to support the album&#x27;s release, Texas went on hiatus. Lead singer Sharleen Spiteri launched a solo career, releasing her debut solo album, &quot;Melody&quot;, in 2008.

As of 2017, Texas&#x27; worldwide sales were 40 million records and they have had thirteen top-ten singles on the UK singles chart and three number-one albums and eight UK top-ten albums on the UK albums chart. Their ninth studio album, &quot;Jump on Board&quot;, released in May 2017, peaked within the top ten of the album charts in Belgium and France, whilst their tenth studio album, &quot;Hi&quot;, released in May 2021, became their highest-charting album in the UK since 1999&#x27;s &quot;The Hush&quot;, debuting at number three on the official UK albums chart and number one on the UK independent albums chart, and entering at number one in their native Scotland.

==History==
===1989–1991: &quot;Southside&quot; and breakthrough===

Texas were formed in 1986 by singer Sharleen Spiteri, bass guitarist Johnny McElhone and guitarist Ally McErlaine. At the time, Spiteri was working at the Irvine Rusk salon as a hairdresser in Glasgow. In 1989, the band, now also featuring Tony McGovern, Eddie Campbell, Michael Bannister and Neil Payne, released their debut EP, &quot;Everyday Now&quot;.

The band&#x27;s debut single, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want a Lover&quot;, was released in January 1989. It peaked at number eight on the UK Singles Chart and No. 77 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, as well as top-40 positions in various countries worldwide. The band released their debut album, &quot;Southside&quot;, in March 1989, which peaked at number three on the UK Albums Chart and was certified Gold by the BPI. However, three further singles from the album all failed to make the UK top 40, with &quot;Thrill Has Gone&quot; reaching No. 60, &quot;Everyday Now&quot; faring little better at No. 44 (though reaching the Top 30 in France), and &quot;Prayer for You&quot; stalling at No. 73.

===1991–1997: &quot;Mothers Heaven&quot; and &quot;Ricks Road&quot;===
The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Mothers Heaven&quot;, was released in September 1991. It was preceded by the single &quot;Why Believe in You&quot;, but this failed to reach the UK top 40 stalling at No. 66 on the UK Singles Chart. This did not bode well for the album, which itself peaked at No. 32 in the UK. A second single, &quot;In My Heart&quot;, fared worse and became Texas&#x27;s lowest-charting single in the UK, reaching No. 74, making it their fifth single in a row to failed to break the top 40. A third single from the album, &quot;Alone with You&quot;, was released in January 1992 and reached No. 32, giving them their second top-40 entry. Ironically, immediately following the disappointing performance of the album and its singles, Texas released a new cover version of the Al Green classic &quot;Tired of Being Alone&quot; in April 1992. The single, which was not included on the album, was more successful and returned the band to the UK top 20, peaking at No. 19.

Texas released their third album, &quot;Ricks Road&quot; in November 1993. It was preceded by two more top-40 singles, &quot;So Called Friend&quot; (UK No. 30) and &quot;You Owe It All to Me&quot; (UK No. 39). The album peaked at No. 18 on the UK Albums Chart. The music video for &quot;You Owe It All to Me&quot; was directed by Dani Jacobs, and was filmed in Arizona and features Spiteri and McErlaine filmed in the style of a road movie with the pair encountering another version of themselves along the way. A third single from the album, &quot;So In Love With You&quot;, reached No. 28 in the UK in February 1994.

===1997–1998: Resurgence and &quot;White on Blonde&quot;===

Following an endorsement by then Radio 1 presenter Chris Evans on his Channel 4 show &quot;TFI Friday&quot; in 1997, Texas came back to the music scene with the international hit &quot;Say What You Want&quot;. The song was released internationally on 6 January 1997 and became the band&#x27;s highest-peaking single to date on the UK Singles Chart, reaching No. 3 in its second week of release. In February, Texas released their fourth album, &quot;White on Blonde&quot;, which went on to become the band&#x27;s most successful album to date. The album debuted at No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart and returned to the top spot again six months later. It remained in the UK top 75 for 91 weeks. A total of five singles were taken from the album, all of which were top-ten hits in the UK. &quot;Halo&quot;, released in April 1997, peaked at No. 10, &quot;Black Eyed Boy&quot;, released in July 1997, peaked at No. 5, and &quot;Put Your Arms Around Me&quot;, released in November 1997, also peaked at No. 10. In 1998, the song was featured in the film &quot;Ever After: A Cinderella Story&quot;, starring Drew Barrymore. The band then released a double A-sided single of &quot;Insane&quot; along with &quot;Say What You Want (All Day, Every Day)&quot;—a new version of the first hit from the album but now with additional rap vocals from the Wu-Tang Clan. The single peaked at No. 4 in the UK.

&quot;White on Blonde&quot; became the pinnacle of the band&#x27;s success, and was certified 6 × Platinum by the BPI for UK sales in excess of 1.8 million copies. It was included in &quot;Q&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;50 Best Albums of 1997&quot;, and voted the 86th-best album of all time by &quot;Q&quot; readers in 1998. It also ranked No. 34 in &quot;Q&quot; &quot;Best 50 Albums of Q&#x27;s Lifetime&quot;, as well being included in &quot;Q&quot; &quot;90 Best Albums of the 1990s&quot;. In 2010, it was nominated for the BRIT Awards &quot;Best Album in the Past 25 Years&quot;.

===1999–2001: &quot;The Hush&quot; and &quot;The Greatest Hits&quot;===
In April 1999, Texas released the first single from their forthcoming fifth studio album. &quot;In Our Lifetime&quot; peaked at No. 4 on the UK Singles Chart and was also included on the &quot;Notting Hill&quot; film soundtrack that year. The band&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;The Hush&quot;, was released in May 1999 and charted at No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart in its first week of release. A second single, &quot;Summer Son&quot;, was released in August 1999, reaching No. 5, the band&#x27;s seventh UK top-ten single at that point. A third and final single, &quot;When We Are Together&quot;, was released in November 1999 and narrowly missed the UK top ten (peaking at 12). The album was certified 3 x Platinum by the BPI for UK sales in excess of 900,000 copies.

In October 2000, Texas released their first compilation album, &quot;The Greatest Hits&quot;. The album featured tracks spanning their career, from their 1989 debut to the current day and included three new songs. A new single, &quot;In Demand&quot; was released on 2 October 2000 and reached No. 6 in the UK, with a video that featured the actor Alan Rickman. When &quot;The Greatest Hits&quot; was released, it became the band&#x27;s third consecutive album to debut at No. 1 in the UK. A second new single from the collection, &quot;Inner Smile&quot;, was released at the end of 2000, also reaching No. 6 on the UK Singles Chart. The video for &quot;Inner Smile&quot; featured a homage to Elvis Presley (and specifically his &#x27;68 Comeback Special shows) with lead singer Spiteri dressed and made up to look like Elvis in his famous black leather suit. In July 2001, a remix of &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want A Lover&quot; was released which made the UK top 20. By this time, &quot;The Greatest Hits&quot; album had become a huge success and was eventually certified 6 × Platinum by the BPI for UK sales in excess of 1.8 million copies.

The single &quot;Like Lovers (Holding On)&quot; was featured during the closing credits of the 2000 animated feature film &quot;Titan A.E.&quot; and also appears briefly in one scene as background music. The song was included on the &quot;Titan A.E.&quot; soundtrack as well.

=== 2003–2006: &quot;Careful What You Wish For&quot; and &quot;Red Book&quot;===
In September 2002, Spiteri gave birth to her daughter, Misty Kyd, although motherhood did not prevent her from working on another album. In October 2003, Texas released the first single from their upcoming sixth album titled &quot;Carnival Girl&quot; which featured rapping vocals by Canadian artist Kardinal Offishall. The song reached No. 9 on the UK Singles Chart. Later that month, the album &quot;Careful What You Wish For&quot; was released. The album peaked at No. 5 on the UK Albums Chart and was certified Gold by the BPI for sales of over 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom. In December 2003, a second and final single was released from the album entitled &quot;I&#x27;ll See It Through&quot;, though this peaked at a lowly No. 40 on the UK Singles Chart.

The band returned in August 2005 with a new single &quot;Getaway&quot;, which peaked at No. 6, becoming the band&#x27;s tenth UK top-ten single. It was followed by another new single, &quot;Can&#x27;t Resist&quot;, released in October 2005. The song reached No. 13 in the UK, and was followed by the band&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;Red Book&quot;, released in November 2005. The album reached No. 16 in the UK Albums Chart, ending their run of top-10 albums though was certified Gold by the BPI for sales of over 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom. A third and final single from the album, &quot;Sleep&quot;, was released in January 2006 and peaked at No. 6 on the UK Singles Chart. The song featured vocals from Paul Buchannan from the Scottish band the Blue Nile and the video featured comedian Peter Kay. On 21 February 2006, a promo-only single, &quot;What About Us&quot;, was released.

===2007–2011: Hiatus===
On 24 September 2007, the band released &quot;The BBC Sessions&quot;, which included radio sessions spanning from 1989 to 2005, with extensive liner notes and interviews with Spiteri. Cover songs include Elmore James&#x27;s &quot;It Hurts Me Too&quot;, the Beatles&#x27; &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Feeling&quot;, and Ashford &amp; Simpson&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;re All I Need to Get By.&quot;

In 2008, Spiteri embarked on a solo career. Her debut album &quot;Melody&quot; was released in July 2008 and debuted at No. 3 in the UK. Spiteri&#x27;s second solo studio album &quot;The Movie Songbook&quot; was released on 1 March 2010, and peaked at No. 13 in the UK.

On 8 September 2009, bandmember Ally McErlaine was hospitalised after he collapsed with a massive brain aneurysm at the age of 40. By February 2010, he was recovering well as reported by bandmate Spiteri in &quot;The Sunday Mail&quot;: &quot;Ally is the most stubborn person I have ever come across, and I think his sheer pigheadedness is the reason he&#x27;s still here! When he asked what was happening with Texas, I said it was up to him. He told me he wanted to get back into the studio&quot;.

===2011–2017: &quot;The Conversation&quot; and &quot;Texas 25&quot;===


After McErlaine survived his collapse—which kills in 80% of cases—Texas reunited for the first time since 2005. The band embarked on a tour in 2011 and lead singer Spiteri appeared on &quot;Popstar to Operastar&quot; on 12 June 2011 singing a version of the band&#x27;s hit &quot;Say What You Want&quot;. Prior to this, Texas had played at the Den Fynske Landsby Festival in Denmark. At the festival, they debuted a new track &quot;The Conversation&quot; which marked the first time the track has been played outside their native Glasgow.

Spiteri was also invited to make a series of cameo appearances at different events, all of which involved film scores. She sang Yvonne Elliman&#x27;s &quot;If I Can&#x27;t Have You&quot; for a &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; tribute concert and duetted with Italian singer Mauro Gioia on the &quot;Love Theme from The Godfather&quot;.

In February 2013, Music Week announced the band had signed a new record deal with PIAS Recordings and were to release their first new album since reuniting. &quot;The Conversation&quot; was released on 20 May 2013. Physical formats included a single disc and double-disc deluxe edition. The latter featured a bonus disc entitled &quot;Live in Scotland&quot;. Also in 2013, a UK tour was announced and the album launched at two gigs, one at King Tut&#x27;s Wah Wah Hut in Glasgow and the other at the 100 Club in London. Spiteri performed a cover of &quot;River Deep – Mountain High&quot; at these gigs as well as a selection of new tracks from &quot;The Conversation&quot;. Tracks are written mainly by Spiteri and McElhone, with Richard Hawley and Bernard Butler as collaborators. The album&#x27;s lead single of the same name joined BBC Radio 2&#x27;s playlist in April 2013 with two more singles, &quot;Detroit City&quot; and &quot;Dry Your Eyes&quot;, following later that year. The album is certified Platinum in France and peaked at No. 4 on the UK Albums Chart.

In November 2014, Texas contributed to BBC Radio 2&#x27;s &quot;Sounds of the 80s&quot; album with a cover of &quot;Don&#x27;t Talk to Me About Love&quot; by Altered Images, a band which also included current Texas member Johnny McElhone in its lineup.

To celebrate the band&#x27;s 25th anniversary, it was announced that some of their biggest hits would be re-recorded for a new album entitled &quot;Texas 25&quot;. The collection features eight songs from the band&#x27;s back catalogue completely reworked with the help of New York production team Truth &amp; Soul, as well as four brand new songs, and was released on 16 February 2015. Deluxe packages include a second disc of the hits in their original form. The lead single, &quot;Start a Family&quot;, premiered online on 6 January 2015. A music video followed, once again starring Alan Rickman who was previously featured in the video for &quot;In Demand&quot;.

The band also embarked on a new UK tour throughout April and May 2015. &quot;An Evening with Texas&quot; was a more intimate arrangement than previous shows and featured stories told by Spiteri from the band&#x27;s 25 years together.

===2017–present: &quot;Jump on Board&quot; and &quot;Hi&quot;===

The band released their ninth studio album, &quot;Jump on Board&quot; in May 2017 to critical acclaim, with &quot;Let&#x27;s Work it Out&quot; serving as the lead single from the new album. &quot;Jump on Board&quot; performed well commercially in the band&#x27;s native Scotland, debuting at number one on the Scottish Albums Chart. The album reached number one in France and performed well in the UK chart. In support of the album, the band embarked on the &quot;Jump on Board Live Tour&quot; world tour.

On 28 February 2020, the band announced on Twitter that its next album was called &quot;Hi&quot;, which was released on BMG on 28 May 2021. A single, also called &quot;Hi&quot;, was released in December 2020 and reunited the band with the Wu-Tang Clan after 22 years. A video was released for the song with &quot;Small Axe&quot; actor Kadeem Ramsay, a promo video that also includes footage of Texas, RZA and Method Man performing &quot;Say What You Want&quot; at the BRIT Awards in 1998.

In April 2021, the second single from &quot;Hi&quot; was released. Called &quot;Mr Haze&quot;, the track sampled the melody from &quot;Love&#x27;s Unkind&quot; (which was a top-5 hit for Donna Summer in the late 1970s) and was performed on &quot;The One Show&quot; on BBC One. &quot;Hi&quot; is the tenth album released by Texas and includes collaborations with Richard Hawley and Altered Images&#x27; Clare Grogan, the latter duetting with Spiteri on the song &quot;Look What You’ve Done&quot;.

Another career-spanning greatest hits collection, &quot;The Very Best of 1989–2023&quot;, was released on 16 June 2023. On 8 June 2023 Texas recorded a video documentary in association with ARTE at the Chateau d&#x27;Herouville. On 23 June 2023, the band played the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury Festival, UK. 

==Hiatus projects==
After the release of Texas&#x27;s 2005 album &quot;Red Book&quot; the band members confirmed that they would enter a hiatus. Spiteri performed as guest vocalist on Rammstein&#x27;s &quot;Rosenrot&quot; album. She began work on her debut solo album, working with some of her former bandmates. She wrote the vast majority of the tracks on the album.

<doc id="412902" wikidata="Q695186" url="?curid=412902" title="United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara">
<text>The United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (; ; ; MINURSO) is the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara, established in 1991 under United Nations Security Council Resolution 690 as part of the Settlement Plan, which had paved way for a cease-fire in the conflict between Morocco and the Polisario Front (representing the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic) over the contested territory of Western Sahara (formerly Spanish Sahara).

MINURSO&#x27;s mission was to monitor the cease-fire and to organize and conduct a referendum in accordance with the Settlement Plan, which would enable the Sahrawi people of Western Sahara to choose between integration with Morocco and independence. This was intended to constitute a Sahrawi exercise of self-determination, and thus complete Western Sahara&#x27;s still-unfinished process of decolonization (Western Sahara is the last major territory remaining on the UN&#x27;s list of non-decolonized territories.)

==Mandate==
According to the United Nations, MINURSO was &quot;originally mandated in accordance with the settlement plan to:

*monitor the ceasefire;
*verify the reduction of Moroccan troops in the Territory;
*monitor the confinement of Moroccan and Frente Polisario troops to designated locations;
*take steps with the parties to ensure the release of all Western Saharan political prisoners or detainees;
*oversee the exchange of prisoners of war, to be implemented by International Committee of the Red Cross, (ICRC);
*repatriate the refugees of Western Sahara, a task to be carried out by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR);
*identify and register qualified voters;
*organise and ensure a free and fair referendum and proclaim the results;
*reduce the threat of unexploded ordnances and mines.&quot;

==Plans==

The independence referendum was originally scheduled for 1992, but conflicts over voter eligibility prevented it from being held. Both sides blamed each other for stalling the process. In 1997, the Houston Agreement was supposed to restart the process, but again failed. In 2003, the Baker Plan was launched to replace the Settlement Plan, but while accepted by the Polisario and unanimously endorsed by the United Nations Security Council, it was rejected by Morocco. Morocco insisted that all inhabitants of the territory should be eligible to vote in the referendum. Following the 1975 Green March, the Moroccan state has sponsored settlement schemes enticing thousands of Moroccans to move into the Moroccan-occupied part of Western Sahara (80% of the territory). By 2015, it was estimated that Moroccan settlers made up at least two thirds of the 500,000 inhabitants.

Presently, there is no plan for holding the referendum, and the viability of the cease-fire is coming into question.

==Extensions==

The MINURSO mandate has been extended 47 times since 1991. In October 2006 the Security Council passed a resolution extending the mandate of MINURSO to April 2007. A provision decrying human rights abuses by Morocco in Western Sahara had the backing of 14 members of the Security Council, but was deleted due to French objections.

In April 2007 the resolution extending the mandate to October took &quot;note of the Moroccan proposal presented on 11 April 2007 to the Secretary-General and welcoming serious and credible Moroccan efforts to move the process forward towards resolution&quot; and also took &quot;note of the Polisario Front proposal presented on 10 April 2007 to the Secretary-General&quot;. The representative of South Africa took exception to the way that one proposal was held more worthy than the other as well as the lack of participation outside the Group of Friends in the drafting of the resolution.

The October 2007 resolution extending the mandate to April 2008 contained the same preferential wording in its description of the two proposals. The representative of South Africa commented on this again, and regretted the fact that the resolution &quot;considered&quot; rather than &quot;welcomed&quot; the report on the situation by the Secretary-General—&quot;presumably because [it] dared to raise the issue of the human rights violations against the Saharawi people&quot;, and quoted the warning in the report about there being no mandate to address the issue of human rights.

The April 2008 resolution extended the mandate for a full year to April 2009. Before the vote, the representative of Costa Rica expressed his &quot;concern at the manner in which the draft resolution on which we are about to vote was negotiated&quot; and a &quot;difficulty in understanding the absolute refusal to include&quot; references to human rights. MINURSO&#x27;s budget is roughly 60 million dollars per year.

==Bases==

There are two sets of teams, those in the Moroccan-controlled portion west of the berm and those in the Sahrawi-controlled region and refugee camps to the east and in Algeria. The camps west of the berm are located in Mahbes, Smara, Umm Dreiga and Auserd. The eastern camps include Bir Lehlou, Tifariti, Mehaires, Mijek, and Agwanit. There is also a liaison office in Tindouf which serves as a communication channel with POLISARIO leadership.

==Current composition==
, MINURSO had a total of 220 uniformed personnel, including 19 contingent troops, 193 experts on mission, 7 staff officers, and 1 police officer, supported by 227 civilian personnel, and 16 UN volunteers. Major troop contributors are Bangladesh, Egypt, and Pakistan. Armed contingents patrol the no man&#x27;s land that borders the Moroccan Wall, to safeguard the cease-fire.

*Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Chief of Mission: Alexander Ivanko () 
*Force Commander: Major general Fakhrul Ahsan ()
*Chief of Mission Support: Veneranda Mukandoli-Jefferson ()
*Chief of Staff: Nick Birnback () 
*Head of Liaison Office, Tindouf: Yusef Jedian ()

Other personnel:

There have been a total of 16 fatalities in MINURSO: six military personnel, a police officer, a military observer, three international civilian personnel, and five local civilian personnel.

==Criticism==
MINURSO is the only UN peacekeeping mission established since 1978 to be operating without the capacity to monitor human rights. Although Resolution 1979 of the UN Security Council recommends the establishment of one, this has not yet happened. In 1995, MINURSO&#x27;s inability or unwillingness to act against perceived Moroccan manipulation of the process, and abuse of Sahrawi civilians, caused its former deputy chairman Frank Ruddy to deliver a strong attack on the organization; he has since kept up his critique of what he argues is an economically costly and politically corrupt process. Growing criticism has been voiced against the UN Security Council for not establishing a program of human rights (as MINURSO is the only UN mission in the world who has no mandate on them) monitoring for Western Sahara and the Sahrawi population, despite serious reports of numerous abuses. This possibility has been denied by France with its veto power on the Security Council. In April 2016, Uruguay and Venezuela expressed their dissatisfaction with this state of affairs by taking the rare step of voting against a Security Council Resolution reauthorizing MINURSO, United Nations Security Council Resolution 2285, from which Russia and two other powers abstained.

Over a two-year period, mostly 2006–2007, MINURSO personnel vandalized archaeological sites by spraying graffiti over prehistoric rock paintings and engravings in the Free Zone (POLISARIO-controlled parts of Western Sahara). There are also accusations of looting of prehistorical paintings by individuals from the UN on some of those sites.

In May 2010, the Polisario Front suspended contacts with the MINURSO, because of the failure on implementing the self-determination referendum, and accused the force of &quot;...turning into a protector shield of a colonial fact, the occupation of the Western Sahara by Morocco&quot;.

<doc id="412903" wikidata="Q726399" url="?curid=412903" title="Gourami">
<text>Gouramis, or gouramies , are a group of freshwater anabantiform fish that comprise the family Osphronemidae. The fish are native to Asia—from the Indian Subcontinent to Southeast Asia and northeasterly towards Korea. The name &quot;gourami&quot;, of Indonesian origin, is also used for fish of the families Helostomatidae and Anabantidae.

Many gouramis have an elongated, feeler-like ray at the front of each of their pelvic fins. All living species show parental care until fry are free swimming: some are mouthbrooders, like the Krabi mouth-brooding betta (&quot;Betta simplex&quot;), and others, like the Siamese fighting fish (&quot;Betta splendens&quot;), build bubble nests. Currently, about 133 species are recognised, placed in four subfamilies and about 15 genera.

The name Polyacanthidae has also been used for this family. Some fish now classified as gouramis were previously placed in family Anabantidae. The subfamily Belontiinae was recently demoted from the family Belontiidae. As labyrinth fishes, gouramis have a lung-like labyrinth organ that allows them to gulp air and use atmospheric oxygen. This organ is a vital adaptation for fish that often inhabit warm, shallow, oxygen-poor water. Gouramis can live for 1–5 years.

The earliest fossil gourami is &quot;Ombilinichthys&quot; from the early-mid Eocene Sangkarewang Formation of Sumatra, Indonesia. A second fossil taxon from the same formation, known from several specimens and tentatively assigned to &quot;Osphronemus goramy&quot; when analyzed in the 1930s, is now lost.

==Subfamilies and genera==

The family Osphronemidae is divided into the following subfamilies and genera:
* family Osphronemidae 
** Genus †&quot;Ombilinichthys&quot; 
** Subfamily Belontiinae 
*** &quot;Belontia&quot; 
** Subfamily Osphroneminae 
*** &quot;Osphronemus&quot; 
** Subfamily Luciocephalinae 
*** &quot;Luciocephalus&quot; 
*** &quot;Sphaerichthys&quot; 
*** &quot;Ctenops&quot; 
*** &quot;Parasphaerichthys&quot; 
*** &quot;Trichopodus&quot; 
** Subfamily Macropodusinae 
*** &quot;Betta&quot; 
*** &quot;Parosphromenus&quot; 
*** &quot;Macropodus&quot; 
*** &quot;Malpulutta&quot; 
*** &quot;Pseudosphromenus&quot; 
*** &quot;Trichopsis&quot; 
** Subafmily Trichogastrinae 
*** &quot;Trichogaster&quot; 

==As food==
Giant gouramis, &quot;Osphronemus goramy&quot;, or Kaloi in Malay, are eaten in some parts of the world. In Maritime Southeast Asian countries, they are often deep-fried and served in sweet-sour sauce, chili sauce, and other spices. The paradise fish, &quot;Macropodus opercularis&quot;, and other members of that genus are the target of a cannery industry in China, the products of which are available in Asian supermarkets around the world.
Gouramis are particularly found in Sundanese cuisine.

In Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines, Brunei, gouramis are readily fished at streams, brooks, canal, rivers and many more large water area systems.

==In the aquarium==
Numerous gourami species, such as the dwarf gourami, pearl gourami, are popular aquarium fish widely kept throughout the world. They are sought after due to their bright colours and relative intelligence, being able to recognise their owners and &quot;greeting&quot; them, having a desire to explore the plants and rocks placed across their aquarium, and displaying extensive paternal care with the males protecting the eggs until they hatch, and building a foam raft to keep them afloat. As labyrinth fish, they will often swim near the top of the tank in order to breathe air. As with other tropical freshwater fish, an aquarium heater is often used. Gouramis will eat either prepared or live foods. Some species can grow quite large and are unsuitable for the general hobbyist. Big gouramis may become territorial with fish that are colourful and a comparable size to them, however that generally depends on the individual&#x27;s temperament, as some gourami will be more tolerant of tankmates than others. Gouramis may nip at other fish, and males should never be kept together as they will become aggressive.

=== Compatibility ===
Generally regarded as peaceful, gouramis are still capable of harassing or killing smaller or long-finned fish. Depending on the species, adult and juvenile males have been known to spar with one another. Aggression can also occur as a result of overcrowding.

Gouramis have been housed with many species, such as danios, mollies, silver dollars, Neon tetras, and plecostomus catfish. Compatibility depends on the species of gourami and the fish it is housed with. Some species (e.g., &quot;Macropodus&quot; or &quot;Belontia&quot;) are highly aggressive or predatory and may harass or kill smaller or less aggressive fish; whereas, others (&quot;Parosphromenus&quot; and &quot;Sphaerichthys&quot;, for instance) are very shy or have specific water requirements and thus will be outcompeted by typical community fish.

<text>Elmore John Leonard Jr. (October 11, 1925August 20, 2013) was an American novelist, short story- and screenwriter. He was, according to British journalist Anthony Lane, &quot;hailed as one of the best crime writers in the land&quot;. His earliest novels, published in the 1950s, were Westerns, but he went on to specialize in crime fiction and suspense thrillers, many of which have been adapted into motion pictures. Among his best-known works are &quot;Hombre&quot;, &quot;Swag&quot;, &quot;City Primeval&quot;, &quot;LaBrava&quot;, &quot;Glitz&quot;, &quot;Freaky Deaky&quot;, &quot;Get Shorty&quot;, &quot;Rum Punch&quot;, &quot;Out of Sight&quot; and &quot;Tishomingo Blues&quot;. 

Leonard&#x27;s short story &quot;Three-Ten to Yuma&quot; was adapted as &quot;3:10 to Yuma&quot;, which was remade in 2007. &quot;Rum Punch&quot; was adapted as the Quentin Tarantino film &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; (1997). Steven Soderbergh adapted &quot;Out of Sight&quot; in 1998 into a film of the same name. &quot;Get Shorty&quot; was adapted into an eponymous film in 1995 and in 2017 it was adapted into a television series of the same name. His writings were also the basis for &quot;The Tall T&quot;, as well as the FX television series &quot;Justified&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Among other honors, he won the 2009 Pen Lifetime Award and the 2012 Medal For Distinguished Contribution to American Letters.

==Early life and education==
Leonard was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, the son of Flora Amelia (née Rive) and Elmore John Leonard. Because his father worked as a site locator for General Motors, the family moved frequently for several years. In 1934, the family settled in Detroit. In the 1930s, there were two news items that would influence many of Leonard&#x27;s works. From 1931, until they were killed in May 1934, gangsters Bonnie and Clyde were on a rampage. In 1934, the baseball team the Detroit Tigers made it to the World Series, winning the Series in 1935. Leonard developed lifelong fascinations with sports and crime. He graduated from the University of Detroit Jesuit High School in 1943 and, after being rejected for the Marines for weak eyesight, immediately joined the Navy, where he served with the Seabees for three years in the South Pacific, where he earned the nickname &quot;Dutch&quot;, after Tigers pitcher Dutch Leonard. Enrolling at the University of Detroit in 1946, he pursued writing more seriously, entering short stories in contests and submitting then to magazines for publication. He graduated in 1950 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English and philosophy. A year before he graduated, he got a job as a copy writer with Campbell-Ewald Advertising Agency, a position he kept for several years, writing on the side.

==Career==
Leonard had his first success in 1951 when &quot;Argosy&quot; magazine published his short story &quot;Trail of the Apaches&quot;. During the 1950s and early &#x27;60s, he continued writing Westerns, publishing more than 30 short stories. His debut novel, &quot;The Bounty Hunters&quot;, was published in 1953 and was followed by four more Westerns. His early work already showed his affection for outsiders and underdogs. He developed his characters through dialogue, each defined by their manner of speech. In many stories, he favored Arizona and New Mexico as settings. Five of his westerns were adapted as movies before 1972: &quot;The Tall T&quot; (1957), &quot;3:10 to Yuma&quot; (1957), &quot;Hombre&quot; (1967), &quot;Valdez Is Coming&quot; (1971), and &quot;Joe Kidd&quot; (1972).

In 1969, his first crime story, &quot;The Big Bounce&quot;, was published by Gold Medal Books. Leonard differed from well-known names writing in this genre⁠—he was less interested in melodrama than in his characters and in realistic dialogue. He wrote the screenplay for, and the novelization of, &quot;Mr. Majestyk&quot; (both 1974); Anthony Lane called the latter &quot;the best novel ever written about a melon grower.&quot; The stories were often located in Detroit but he also liked to use South Florida as a setting. &quot;LaBrava&quot;, a 1983 novel set in the latter locale, was praised in a &quot;New York Times&quot; review, which said Leonard moved from mystery suspense short story writer to novelist. His next novel, &quot;Glitz&quot; (1985), an Atlantic City gambling story, was his breakout in the crime genre. It spent 16 weeks on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, and his subsequent crime novels were all bestsellers. In his review of &quot;Glitz&quot;, Stephen King placed Leonard in the company of Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett and John D. MacDonald. 
Leonard believed that his books during the 1980s were becoming funnier and that he was developing a style that was more free and easy. His own favorites were &quot;Freaky Deaky&quot; (1988), about ex-hippie criminals and the Dixie Mafia story &quot;Tishomingo Blues&quot; (2002).
Some of Leonard&#x27;s characters appear in several novels, including mobster Chili Palmer, bank robber Jack Foley and the U. S. Marshals Carl Webster and Raylan Givens.

At the time of his death his novels had sold tens of millions of copies.
Among film adaptations of his work are &quot;Jackie Brown&quot;, (1997), based on &quot;Rum Punch&quot; and described as an &quot;homage to the author&#x27;s trademark rhythm and pace&quot;; &quot;Get Shorty&quot; (1995); &quot;Out of Sight&quot; (1998) and the TV series &quot;Justified&quot; (2010–2015) and &quot;&quot; (2023–). Nearly thirty movies were made from Leonard&#x27;s novels, but for some critics his special style worked best in print.

==Personal life==
He married Beverly Clare Cline in 1949 and had five children with her—two daughters and three sons—before divorcing in 1977. His second marriage in 1979, to Joan Leanne Lancaster (aka Joan Shepard), ended with her death in 1993. Later that same year, he married Christine Kent; they divorced in 2012. Leonard spent the last years of his life with his family in Oakland County, Michigan. He suffered a stroke on July 29, 2013. Initial reports stated that he was recovering, but on August 20, 2013, Leonard died at his home in the Detroit suburb of Bloomfield Hills of stroke complications. He was 87 years old. One of Leonard&#x27;s grandchildren is Alex Leonard, the drummer in the Detroit band Protomartyr.

==Style and influence==
Commended by critics for his gritty realism and strong dialogue, Leonard sometimes took liberties with grammar in the interest of speeding the story along. In his essay &quot;Elmore Leonard&#x27;s Ten Rules of Writing&quot; he said: &quot;My most important rule is one that sums up the 10: If it sounds like writing, I rewrite it.&quot; He also said: &quot;I try to leave out the parts that readers tend to skip.&quot;

Leonard has been called &quot;the Dickens of Detroit&quot; because of his intimate portraits of people from that city, though he said, &quot;If I lived in Buffalo, I&#x27;d write about Buffalo.&quot; His favorite epithet was given to him by Britain&#x27;s &quot;New Musical Express&quot;: &quot;the poet laureate of wild assholes with revolvers&quot;. His ear for dialogue has been praised by writers such as Saul Bellow and Martin Amis. &quot;Your prose makes Raymond Chandler look clumsy,&quot; Amis told Leonard at a Writers Guild event in Beverly Hills in 1998. Stephen King called Leonard &quot;the great American writer.&quot; According to Charles Rzepka of Boston University, Leonard&#x27;s mastery of free indirect discourse, a third-person narrative technique that gives the illusion of immediate access to a character&#x27;s thoughts, &quot;is unsurpassed in our time, and among the surest of all time, even if we include Jane Austen, Gustave Flaubert, and Hemingway in the mix.&quot;

Leonard often cited Hemingway as his most important influence but also criticized his lack of humor. Still, it was Leonard&#x27;s affection for Hemingway, and for George V. Higgins, that led him to will his personal papers to the University of South Carolina, where many of Hemingway&#x27;s and Higgins&#x27; papers are archived. Leonard&#x27;s papers reside at the university&#x27;s Irvin Department of Rare Books and Special Collections. John Steinbeck was another influence.

Leonard in turn had a very strong influence on a generation of crime writers that followed him, among them George Pelecanos, Michael Connelly, Dennis Lehane, and Laura Lippman.

Anthony Lane praised Leonard&#x27;s ear for dialogue, comparing him to Dickens and Evelyn Waugh: Leonard can make do with a single letter, or a blank where a letter is meant to be. &quot;What in the hell&#x27;s a Albanian?,&quot; a guy named Clement asks in Chapter 4 of &quot;City Primeval&quot; (1980). Typesetters may have pounced upon what they took to be a typo, but Leonard never misheard. In that respect, as in others, he was less like Hemingway—of whom he was a fan, and to whom he was often compared—than like Dickens, another city kid with his nose and ear to the ground... One proof of literary genius, we might say, is a democratic generosity toward your mother tongue—the conviction that every part or particle of speech, be it e&#x27;er so humble, can be put to fruitful use...

 He is gone now, but he left us a fine consolation: if you&#x27;ve never read him, or if you&#x27;d never heard of him until yesterday, or if you merely need a fitting way to mourn, pick up &quot;52 Pick-Up,&quot; &quot;LaBrava,&quot; &quot;Swag,&quot; or &quot;Glitz,&quot; and tune into the voices of America—calling loud and clear, and largely ungrammatical, from Atlantic City, Miami, Hollywood, and his home turf of Detroit. Elmore Leonard got them right, and did them proud. As Clement would say, he was a author.

<doc id="412909" wikidata="Q839490" url="?curid=412909" title="Substructural logic">
<text>In logic, a substructural logic is a logic lacking one of the usual structural rules (e.g. of classical and intuitionistic logic), such as weakening, contraction, exchange or associativity. Two of the more significant substructural logics are relevance logic and linear logic.

==Examples==
In a sequent calculus, one writes each line of a proof as

:formula_1.

Here the structural rules are rules for rewriting the LHS of the sequent, denoted Γ, initially conceived of as a string (sequence) of propositions. The standard interpretation of this string is as conjunction: we expect to read

:formula_2

as the sequent notation for

:(&quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;) implies &quot;C&quot;.

Here we are taking the RHS Σ to be a single proposition &quot;C&quot; (which is the intuitionistic style of sequent); but everything applies equally to the general case, since all the manipulations are taking place to the left of the turnstile symbol formula_3.

Since conjunction is a commutative and associative operation, the formal setting-up of sequent theory normally includes structural rules for rewriting the sequent Γ accordingly—for example for deducing

:formula_4

from

:formula_5.

There are further structural rules corresponding to the &quot;idempotent&quot; and &quot;monotonic&quot; properties of conjunction: from

:formula_6

we can deduce

:formula_7.

Also from

:formula_7

one can deduce, for any &quot;B&quot;,

:formula_9.

Linear logic, in which duplicated hypotheses &#x27;count&#x27; differently from single occurrences, leaves out both of these rules, while relevant (or relevance) logics merely leaves out the latter rule, on the ground that &quot;B&quot; is clearly irrelevant to the conclusion.

The above are basic examples of structural rules. It is not that these rules are contentious, when applied in conventional propositional calculus. They occur naturally in proof theory, and were first noticed there (before receiving a name).

== Premise composition ==
There are numerous ways to compose premises (and in the multiple-conclusion case, conclusions as well). One way is to collect them into a set. But since e.g. {a,a} = {a} we have contraction for free if premises are sets. We also have associativity and permutation (or commutativity) for free as well, among other properties. In substructural logics, typically premises are not composed into sets, but rather they are composed into more fine-grained structures, such as trees or multisets (sets that distinguish multiple occurrences of elements) or sequences of formulae. For example, in linear logic, since contraction fails, the premises must be composed in something at least as fine-grained as multisets.

== History ==
Substructural logics are a relatively young field. The first conference on the topic was held in October 1990 in Tübingen, as &quot;Logics with Restricted Structural Rules&quot;. During the conference, Kosta Došen proposed the term &quot;substructural logics&quot;, which is now in use today.

<doc id="412912" wikidata="Q4926715" url="?curid=412912" title="Blindspott">
<text>Blindspott is an alternative metal band from West Auckland, New Zealand. After performing under the name Blacklistt for several years, the original line-up got back together in 2018. The band was formed in 1997 with members Damian Alexander (vocals), Marcus Powell (guitar, backing vocals), Shelton Woolright (drums), Gareth Fleming (bass) and Karl Vilisini, also known as DJ Dlay (turntables, keyboards).

==History==

===Formation and debut album (1997–2004)===

Blindspott was formed in 1997 and developed a loyal following in the years leading up to their self-titled album release. Often labelled as a &quot;nu-metal&quot; band, the band has insisted this genre label was a result of the world catching up to their early development, rather than capitalising on a popular sound at the time. Blindspott&#x27;s first single, &quot;Nil By Mouth&quot;, was a success in 2001 and gained major airplay on television and radio channels across the country. Other hits released during 2001-2003 were &quot;Room to Breathe&quot;, &quot;Phlex&quot; (which reached No. 2 on the charts), &quot;Blank&quot;, &quot;S.U.I.T&quot; and &quot;Lit Up&quot;. &quot;Blindspott&quot;, their self-titled debut album, was released in 2002 and reached number 1, going platinum in New Zealand in its first week of release. The album has since been certified 3× Platinum in New Zealand.

===&quot;End The Silence&quot; and line-up change (2005–2007)===

Blindspott underwent a line-up change for the writing and recording of their second album, &quot;End the Silence&quot;. Fleming and Vilisini were replaced by Dave McDermott on bass and Brandon Reihana as a second guitarist. McDermott had worked for the band as a technician, while Reihana first toured with the group as substitute bassist when they went to Japan in 2004. The second album digressed significantly from the nu-metal style of their debut album, developing a darker hard-rock sound, without scratching and hip-hop influences.

Their first single from the new album, &quot;Drown&quot;, was released on 1 May 2006 and entered the official New Zealand music chart on 7 May 2006, going straight to No. 4. &quot;End the Silence&quot; was released shortly after in New Zealand on 29 May 2006 and broke New Zealand music records - in the first week of release it went straight to the top of the official New Zealand music charts.

In August 2006, Blindspott played at the Summer Sonic Festival in Tokyo, Japan, alongside major acts such as Metallica, Deftones, Linkin Park and Tool.

&quot;End the Silence&quot; was released in Australia on 2 September 2006.

===Break-up and reunion show (2007–2009)===

In 2007, after 10 years together and many publicised band fallouts, Blindspott broke up. The band played its final concert on 25 August 2007 at the Powerstation nightclub in Auckland. On 27 July 2009 they released a live CD/DVD filmed at the Powerstation concert.

In November 2008, Blindspott announced they were reuniting for a one-off performance at the Vodafone Homegrown Music Festival in Wellington on 14 March 2009 as one of three acts reforming to perform at the festival.

===Reformation and current events (2010–present)===
Founding member Marcus Powell released a new track called &quot;Sleep&quot; with his side project - City of Souls in March 2015.

On 15 May 2010, it was announced on Facebook that Blindspott had reunited and were writing new material. The band had also reformed to include its original members. The same day they were confirmed for Homegrown 2011. On 27 September a photo was posted by a band member showing Tristan Reilly as the new drummer for the band.

On 5 March 2011, lead singer Damian Alexander announced they would be releasing their new single &quot;From The Blind Spot&quot; under the name Blacklistt for legal reasons. Currently the band members are in a legal battle with former drummer, Shelton Woolright, to keep releasing music under the name of Blindspott. Entertainment lawyer Mick Sinclair is handling the case for Blindspott. In August 2011, it was revealed that the band would continue under the name Blacklistt instead of giving in to Shelton Woolwright&#x27;s demands. A video clip for the band&#x27;s single &quot;From the Blind Spot&quot; was released in January 2012.

On 31 August 2018, the band members, including Shelton Woolwright, announced they would be reforming for a one off show in September as part of the Rock1500 Countdown. The band then later announced that they would embark on a reunion tour in December with support from fellow NZ band Devilskin. On 1 October 2018, it was announced that Blindspott would be performing at Homegrown 2019.

On 14 February 2020, band members Shelton Woolwright and Marcus Powell, announced they had reformed Blindspott and will be touring New Zealand during March and April 2020, with a majority of these dates later postponed to October and November due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The band also performed at Homegrown 2021 the following March.

<text>Inkscape is a vector graphics editor. It is used for both artistic and technical illustrations such as cartoons, clip art, logos, typography, diagrams, and flowcharts. It uses vector graphics to allow for sharp printouts and renderings at unlimited resolution and is not bound to a fixed number of pixels like raster graphics. It is free and open-source software released under a GNU General Public License (GPL) 2.0 or later.

Inkscape uses a file format defined by a technical standard named Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) as its main format, which is supported by many other applications including web browsers. It can import and export various other file formats, including Adobe Illustrator (AI), Encapsulated PostScript (EPS), PDF, PostScript (PS) and PNG.

Inkscape can render primitive vector shapes (e.g. rectangles, ellipses, polygons, arcs, spirals, stars and 3D boxes) and text. These objects may be filled with solid colors, patterns, radial or linear color gradients and their borders may be stroked, both with adjustable transparency. Embedding and optional tracing of raster graphics is also supported, enabling the editor to create vector graphics from photos and other raster sources. Created shapes can be further manipulated with geometric transformations, such as moving, rotating, scaling, and skewing.

==History==
Inkscape began in 2003 as a code fork of the Sodipodi project. Sodipodi, developed since 1999, was based on Raph Levien&#x27;s GNOME Illustration Application (Gill). One of the main priorities of the Inkscape project was interface consistency and usability by following the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines.

Inkscape FAQ interprets the word &quot;Inkscape&quot; as a compound of &quot;ink&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

Four former Sodipodi developers (Ted Gould, Bryce Harrington, Nathan Hurst, and &quot;MenTaLguY&quot;) led the fork, citing differences over project objectives, openness to third-party contributions, and technical disagreements. They said that Inkscape would focus development on implementing the complete SVG standard, whereas Sodipodi development emphasized developing a general-purpose vector graphics editor, possibly at the expense of SVG.

Following the fork, Inkscape&#x27;s developers changed the programming language from C to C++; adopted the GTK toolkit (formerly GIMP Toolkit) C++ bindings (gtkmm); redesigned its user interface, and added a number of new features. Inkscape&#x27;s implementation of the SVG standard, although incomplete, has shown gradual improvement.

Since 2005, Inkscape has participated in the Google Summer of Code program.

Up until the end of November 2007, Inkscape&#x27;s source code repository was hosted by SourceForge. Thereafter it moved to Launchpad. In June 2017, it moved to GitLab.

==Features==

===Object creation===
Inkscape workflow is based on vector objects. Tools allow manipulating primitive vector shapes: simple ones like rectangles, ellipses, and arcs, and more complex ones like 3D boxes with adjustable perspectives, stars, polygons, and spirals. Rendering feature that can create objects like barcodes, calendars, grids, gears, and roulette curves (using the spirograph tool). These objects may be filled with solid colors, patterns, radial or linear color gradients and their borders may be stroked, both with adjustable transparency. All of those can be further edited by transformations, such as moving, rotating, scaling, and skewing, or by editing paths.

Other tools allow creating Bézier curves, freehand drawing of lines (pencil), or calligraphic (brush-like) strokes which support a graphics tablet.

Inkscape can write and edit text with tools available for changing font, spacing, kerning, rotation, flowing along the path or into a shape. Text can be converted to paths for further editing. The program also has layers (and objects) feature that allows organizing objects in a preferred stacking order in the canvas. Objects can be made visible or invisible, and locked or unlocked, via these features.

Symbol libraries enable Inkscape to use existing symbols like logic-gate symbols or DOT pictograms. More libraries can be added as needed.

Inkscape supports image tracing, the process of extracting vector graphics from raster sources.

Clones are child objects of an original parent object. Different transformations can be applied to them, such as: size, position, rotation, blur, opacity, color, and symmetry. Clones are updated live whenever the parent object changes.

===Object manipulation===
Every object in the drawing can be subjected to arbitrary affine transformations: moving, rotating, scaling, skewing, and a configurable matrix. Transformation parameters can be specified numerically. Transformations can snap to angles, grids, guidelines and nodes of other objects, or be aligned in specified direction, spaced equally, scattered at random.

Objects can be grouped together. Groups of objects behave similarly to objects. Objects in a group can be edited without having to ungroup them first.

The Z-order determines the order in which objects are drawn on the canvas. Objects with a high Z-order are drawn on top of objects lower in the Z-order. Order of objects can be managed either using layers, or by manually moving the object up and down in the Z-order. Layers can be locked or hidden, preventing modifying and accidental selection.

The &quot;Create Tiled Clones&quot; tool allows symmetrical or grid-like drawings using various plane symmetries.

Appearance of objects can be further changed by using masks and clipping paths, which can be created from arbitrary objects, including groups.

The style attributes are &#x27;attached&#x27; to the source object, so after cutting/copying an object onto the clipboard, the style&#x27;s attributes can be pasted to another object.

Objects can also be moved by manually entering the location coordinates in the top toolbar. Even additions and subtractions can be done this way.

===Operations on paths===

Inkscape has a comprehensive tool set to edit paths (as they are the basic element of a vector file):
* &quot;Edit Path by Node tool&quot;: allows for the editing of single or multiple paths and or their associated node(s). There are four types of path nodes; Cusp (corner), Smooth, Symmetric and Auto-Smooth. Editing is available for the positioning of nodes and their associated handles (angle and length) for Linear and Bézier paths or Spiro curves. A path segment can also be adjusted. When multiple nodes are selected, they can be moved, scaled and rotated using keyboard shortcut or mouse controls. More nodes can be inserted into paths at arbitrary or even placements, and an effect can be used to insert nodes at predefined intervals. When nodes are deleted, the handles on remaining ones are adjusted to preserve the original shape as closely as possible.
* &quot;Tweak tool (sculpting/painting)&quot;: provides whole object(s) or node editing regions (parts) of an object. It can push, repel/attract, randomize positioning, shrink/enlarge, rotate, copy/delete selected whole objects. With parts of a path you can push, shrink/enlarge, repel/attract, roughen edges, blur and color. Nodes are dynamically created and deleted when needed while using this tool, so it can also be used on simple paths without pre-processing.
* &quot;Path-Offsets; Outset, Inset, Linked or Dynamic&quot;: can create a Linked or Dynamic (unlinked) Inset and or an Outset of an existing path which can then be fine tuned using the given Shape or Node tool. Creating a Linked Offset of a path will update whenever the original is modified. Making symmetrical (i.e., picture frame) graphics easier to edit.
* &quot;Path-Conversion; Object to Path&quot;: conversions of Objects; Shapes (square, circle, etc.) or Text into paths.
* &quot;Path-Conversion; Stroke to Path&quot;: conversions of the Stroke of a shape to a path.
* &quot;Path-Simplify&quot;: a given path&#x27;s node count will reduce while preserving the shape.
* &quot;Path-Operations&quot; (Boolean operations): use of multiple objects to Union, Difference, Intersection, Exclusion, Division and Cut Path.

Inkscape includes a feature called &quot;Live Path Effects&quot; (LPE), which can apply various modifiers to a path. Envelope Deformation is available via the Path Effects and provides a perspective effect. There are more than a dozen of these live path effects. LPE can be stacked onto a single object and have interactive live on canvas and menu-based editing of the effects.

===File formats===

Inkscape&#x27;s primary format is SVG 1.1, meaning that it can create and edit with the abilities and within the constraints of this format. Any other format must either be imported (converted to SVG) or exported (converted from SVG). The SVG format is using the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) standard internally. Inkscape&#x27;s implementation of SVG and CSS standards is incomplete. Most notably, it does not support animation natively. Inkscape has multilingual support, particularly for complex scripts. Formats that used the UniConvertor library are not supported beyond the 1.0 release. A workaround is to have a parallel installation of version 0.92.x.

===Other features===
* &quot;XML Editor&quot; for direct manipulation of the SVG XML structure
* Support for SVG filter effects
* Editing of Resource Description Framework (RDF), a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) metadata information model
* Command-line interface, exposes format conversion functions and full-featured GUI scripting
* More than sixty interface languages
* Extensible to new file formats, effects and other features
* Mathematical diagramming, with various uses of LaTeX
* Experimental support for scripting
* lib2Geom is now also external usable. 2Geom is a computational geometry library, originally developed for Inkscape. While developed for Inkscape it is a library that can be used from any application. It provides support for basic geometric algebra, paths, distortions, Boolean operations, plotting implicit functions, non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) and more. 2Geom is free software released under LGPL 2.1 or MPL 1.1.

==Platform support==
The latest version of Inkscape 1.0.x (and older line 0.92.x) is available for Linux, Windows 7+, and macOS 10.11–10.15 platforms. Inkscape is packaged with AppImage, Flatpak, PPA, Snap and source by all major Linux distributions (including Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, OpenSUSE) with GTK+ 3.24+ (0.92.x with GTK+ 2.20+ for older Linux).

Inkscape can also be installed via FreeBSD ports and pkgsrc, the latter being native to NetBSD, but well-supported on most POSIX platforms, including GNU/Linux, Illumos, and macOS.

, Wacom tablet support for GTK 3 is in a reviving project. Version 1.0.x includes GTK 3 and Wacom support depending necessary Wacom Linux or Unix driver.

===macOS===
An issue had affected all GTK3 based apps on macOS Ventura (macOS 13), making the app unresponsive to certain mouse events. GTK is used by many different programs. GTK is a free and open-source cross-platform software widget toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Inkscape 1.2.2 was also affected and the web site of Inkscape recommended not to install it on Ventura as long as a stable solution was not available. These issues were fixed from version 1.3.

Most of the compatibility issues with Apple silicon processors (M1, M2 and M3 families) appear to have also been resolved from version 1.3 and the macOS download site for Inkscape offers two options: the Intel version and the arm64 corresponding to the Apple Silicon M family.

==Release history==
==Reception==
In its 2012 Best of Open Source Software Awards, &quot;InfoWorld&quot; gave Inkscape an award for being one of the best open-source desktop applications, commending its typographic controls and ability to directly edit the XML text of its documents.

&quot;PC Magazine&quot;″s February 2019 review was rather mixed, giving the application three out of five. It criticized the interface&#x27;s graphics and lack of optimization for stylus support, the application&#x27;s poor interoperability with other graphics editors, unwieldy text formatting controls, and the quality of the Mac version. However, it did praise the ability to add custom filters and extensions, the Inkscape community&#x27;s passion for creating and sharing them, and the precise path and placement tools. The review concluded that whilst Inkscape &quot;boasts outstanding features and a passionate user base for a free program ... it&#x27;s not suitable for busy professionals.&quot;

In January 2020, &quot;TechRadar&quot; gave Inkscape a positive rating of four stars out of five. It lauded the wide range of editing tools and support for many file formats, but noted that the application&#x27;s processing can be slow. It considered Inkscape to be a good free alternative to proprietary graphics editors such as Adobe Illustrator.

According to &quot;It&#x27;s FOSS&quot; in July 2023, the 1.3 release of Inkscape mainly focuses on making the user&#x27;s workflow more organized to work more efficiently, with some new features making it a better alternative to Adobe Illustrator.

<doc id="412918" wikidata="Q2293002" url="?curid=412918" title="Reiser4">
<text>Reiser4 is a computer file system, successor to the ReiserFS file system, developed from scratch by Namesys and sponsored by DARPA as well as Linspire. Reiser4 was named after its former lead developer Hans Reiser. , the Reiser4 patch set is still being maintained, but according to Phoronix, it is unlikely to be merged into mainline Linux without corporate backing.

== Features ==
Some of the goals of the Reiser4 file system are:

* Atomicity (filesystem operations either complete, or they do not, and they do not corrupt due to partially occurring)
* Different transaction models: journaling, write-anywhere (copy-on-write), hybrid transaction model
* More efficient journaling through wandering logs
* More efficient support of small files, in terms of disk space and speed through block suballocation
* Liquid items (or virtual keys) – a special format of records in the storage tree, which completely resolves the problem of internal fragmentation
* EOTTL (extents on the twig level) – fully balanced storage tree, meaning that all paths to objects are of equal length
* Faster handling of directories with large numbers of files
* Transparent compression: Lempel-Ziv-Oberhumer (LZO), zlib
* Plugin infrastructure
* Dynamically optimized disk-layout through allocate-on-flush (also called delayed allocation in XFS)
* Delayed actions (tree balancing, compression, block allocation, local defragmentation)
* R and D (Rare and Dense) caches, synchronized at commit time
* Transactions support for user-defined integrity
* Metadata and inline-data checksums
* Mirrors and failover
* Precise discard support with delayed issuing of discard requests for SSD devices

Some of the more advanced Reiser4 features (such as user-defined transactions) are also not available because of a lack of a VFS API for them.

At present Reiser4 lacks a few standard file system features, such as an online repacker (similar to the defragmentation utilities provided with other file systems). The creators of Reiser4 say they will implement these later, or sooner if someone pays them to do so.

== Performance ==
Reiser4 uses B*-trees in conjunction with the dancing tree balancing approach, in which underpopulated nodes will not be merged until a flush to disk except under memory pressure or when a transaction completes. Such a system also allows Reiser4 to create files and directories without having to waste time and space through fixed blocks.

, synthetic benchmarks performed by Namesys in 2003 show that Reiser4 is 10 to 15 times faster than its most serious competitor ext3 working on files smaller than 1 KiB. Namesys&#x27;s benchmarks suggest it is typically twice the performance of ext3 for general-purpose filesystem usage patterns. Other benchmarks from 2006 show results of Reiser4 being slower on many operations. Benchmarks conducted in 2013 with Linux Kernel version 3.10 show that Reiser4 is considerably faster in various tests compared to in-kernel filesystems ext4, btrfs and XFS.

==Integration with Linux==
Reiser4 has patches for Linux 2.6, 3.x, 4.x and 5.x., but , Reiser4 has not been merged into the mainline Linux kernel and consequently is still not supported on many Linux distributions; however, its predecessor ReiserFS v3 has been widely adopted. Reiser4 is also available from Andrew Morton&#x27;s -mm kernel sources, and from the Zen patch set. The Linux kernel developers claim that Reiser4 does not follow the Linux &quot;coding style&quot; by the decision to use its own plugin system, but Hans Reiser suggested the decision was made for political reasons.
The latest released Reiser4 kernel patches and tools can be downloaded from Reiser4 project page at sourceforge.net.

== History of Reiser4 ==

Hans Reiser was convicted of murder on April 28, 2008, leaving the future of Reiser4 uncertain. After his arrest, employees of Namesys were assured they would continue to work and that the events would not slow down the software development in the immediate future. In order to afford increasing legal fees, Hans Reiser announced on December 21, 2006, that he was going to sell Namesys; as of March 26, 2008, it had not been sold, although the website was unavailable. In January 2008, Edward Shishkin, an employee of and programmer for Namesys, was quoted in a CNET interview saying, &quot;Commercial activity of Namesys has stopped.&quot; Shishkin and others continued the development of Reiser4, making source code available from Shishkin&#x27;s web site, later relocated to kernel.org. Since 2008, Namesys employees have received 100% of their sponsored funding from DARPA.

In 2010, Phoronix wrote that Edward Shishkin was exploring options to get Reiser4 merged into Linux kernel mainline. , the file system is still being updated for new kernel releases, but has not been submitted for merging. In 2015, Michael Larabel mentioned it is unlikely to happen without corporate backing, and then he suggested in April 2019 that the main obstacle could be the renaming of Reiser4 to avoid reference to the initial author who was convicted of murder.

Shishkin announced a Reiser5 filesystem on December 31, 2019.

<text>James Allen Nussle (born June 27, 1960) is an American businessman and retired politician who has been president and chief executive officer of the Credit Union National Association from 2014 to 2024 and of its successor group America&#x27;s Credit Unions since 2024. Nussle served as a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from 1991 to 2007 and was the Republican nominee for the 2006 Iowa gubernatorial election, losing to Democrat Chet Culver. He was then appointed director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in 2007 by President George W. Bush, an office he retained until 2009.

==Early life and career==
Nussle was born in Des Moines, Iowa. After high school, Nussle studied in Denmark. He then received a B.A. in international studies, political science, and economics from Luther College in 1983, and a J.D. degree from Drake University in Des Moines in 1985. After graduation from Drake University law school, Nussle was elected as the Delaware County, Iowa attorney in Manchester.

==Political career==

===Congressional career===
In 1990, then 2nd congressional district representative, Tom Tauke, ran against Senator Tom Harkin. Nussle ran as the Republican candidate for Tauke&#x27;s House seat against Eric Tabor and won.

In 1992, as a result of redistricting, Nussle&#x27;s district was merged with the 3rd congressional district of Democrat David R. Nagle. Nussle defeated Nagle and won reelection.

Nussle&#x27;s first exposure to national attention came when he made a speech from the well of the House while wearing a paper bag over his head to protest the &quot;shameful&quot; ethical behavior involved in the House banking scandal.

He became Chairman of the House Budget Committee in 2001, the first Iowan to serve as chair of the committee. His position brought national and international interest to his district, including the ONE Campaign, the lobbying group formed by Bono of the rock band U2. The group has targeted Nussle&#x27;s district with billboard and radio ads. On March 23, 2006, they placed a statement in Nussle&#x27;s article on English Wikipedia, regarding poverty in Africa and Nussle&#x27;s budget influence, hoping to influence Nussle. The statement was quickly removed by editors as it violated English Wikipedia policies on maintaining a neutral point of view. On March 24, 2006, &quot;The Des Moines Register&quot; contained a story about this revision in which ONE confirmed that they had placed the statement.

Nussle&#x27;s voting record was relatively conservative, despite representing a district with a slight Democratic lean. He had a lifetime rating of 85 from the American Conservative Union. His district has voted for the Democratic presidential candidate in every election since 1988. Typical conservative positions Nussle embraced are supporting restrictions on abortion and supporting President Bush&#x27;s tax cuts. His district was renumbered as the 1st District as a result of the 2000s (decade) round of redistricting, and became even more Democratic with the addition of much of Iowa&#x27;s share of the Quad Cities. However, Nussle was reelected handily in 2002 and 2004.

===2006 gubernatorial bid===

When Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack announced that he would not seek a third term in 2006, a number of people from both parties began exploring running for the governorship. That included Nussle, who began considering a run shortly after Vilsack made his announcement. On June 2, 2005, Nussle announced he would run for the position. His only serious primary challenger, Bob Vander Plaats, withdrew from the race to endorse Nussle and become his running mate.

On February 21, 2006, the Iowa Democratic Party filed an ethics complaint against Nussle for not reporting any in-kind donations from the federal &quot;Nussle for Congress Committee&quot;. On July 12, 2006, the Iowa Ethics and Campaign Disclosure Board unanimously voted to close the investigation with a finding of no probable cause to believe that a violation of a statute or rule under the board&#x27;s jurisdiction occurred.

On June 6, 2006, Nussle won the Republican primary, but lost the general election to Iowa Secretary of State Chet Culver on November 7 by a wide margin. After the defeat, he first started his own consulting business. In 2007, he was nominated to become Director of the Office of Management and Budget by President Bush.

Three Republicans and four Democrats announced their intentions to seek the House seat Nussle was vacating in January, 2007. The primaries pared the candidates down to Democrat Bruce Braley and Republican Mike Whalen. Braley won Nussle&#x27;s former seat.

===OMB Director===

Nussle was nominated by George W. Bush to replace Rob Portman as OMB Director. He was sworn in on September 10, 2007. A March 9, 2005 quote of Nussle&#x27;s was included in the &quot;2006 World Almanac and Book of Facts&quot;&#x27;s list of notable quotes in 2005 (p. 39): &quot;Everyone wants to get to heaven, but no one wants to die.&quot; According to the almanac, the quote refers to opposition to his proposed budget, which included cuts to several earmarks and programs; the statement was made during Nussle&#x27;s tenure as House Budget Committee Chairman.

==Post-political career==
After leaving the Bush administration in January 2009, Nussle founded the Nussle Group, a media and strategic consulting firm. In November 2010, Nussle became president and COO of Growth Energy. In September 2014, it was announced that he would become the president and chief executive officer of the Credit Union National Association, a trade group for credit unions.

In 2021, Nussle said that he would no longer affiliate with the Republican Party, following the January 6 United States Capitol attack.

<text>Leonard Leroy Boswell (January 10, 1934 – August 17, 2018) was an American politician who served as the U.S. representative for from 1997 to 2013, a district based in Des Moines. A member of the Democratic Party, he was defeated for reelection in 2012 by 4th district incumbent Tom Latham, who decided to run against him after redistricting. Boswell left Congress in January 2013.

==Early life, education and career==
Boswell was born in Harrison County, Missouri, the son of Margaret and Melvin Boswell. He was raised on a farm and educated at Graceland University in Lamoni, Iowa.

Boswell spent twenty years in the United States Army. He was first drafted in the Army in 1956 as a private. He later graduated from Artillery Officers Candidate School, eventually rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel. During his military career, he earned two Distinguished Flying Crosses, two Bronze Stars, the Soldier&#x27;s Medal, and various other awards and decorations. He served two one-year tours of duty as an assault helicopter pilot in Vietnam. He also served two NATO tours of duty in Europe, first for four years in Germany, and later three years in Portugal. Additionally, he taught at the Army Command and General Staff College.

==Early political career==
Boswell was elected to the Iowa Senate in 1984 and served three terms in that body. In 1986, he ran for the United States House of Representatives, but was narrowly defeated by Scott Hughes of Council Bluffs in the Democratic primary. He was President of the Iowa Senate from 1993 to 1996. He was the Democratic nominee for Lieutenant Governor of Iowa in 1994, as Bonnie Campbell&#x27;s running mate.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Agriculture
**Subcommittee on General Farm Commodities and Risk Management (Ranking Member)
**Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy, and Poultry
*Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure
**Subcommittee on Highways and Transit

===Issues===
In the 111th Congress, Boswell voted with Democratic leadership more often than 131 members, or 49%, of the Democratic Caucus.

====Taxes====
In a debate in 2012, Boswell said that he opposes an extension of the Bush tax cuts and supports tax increases for those with high incomes. Boswell criticized his opponent for signing a pledge not to raise taxes. Boswell said, &quot;If you look at this trickle-down theory, I don&#x27;t see where that&#x27;s been a historical success.&quot;

====Health care====
Boswell supported the Affordable Care Act. In a 2012 debate, Boswell defended his vote in favor of the Affordable Care Act. He said, &quot;Obamacare … is actually working. I think the people out across Iowa as they talk to me about it, the parts of it that have really been important to them, they&#x27;re appreciative of.&quot;

Boswell authored H.R. 327, the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act, which was signed into law in 2007 and provides mental health services and support for veterans.

Boswell voted to expand funding for the State Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) and voted twice to override the President&#x27;s veto of SCHIP legislation. cap and trade legislation for carbon emissions, and h

====Education====
Boswell has voted to double Pell Grants and supported the 2007 College Cost Reduction and Access Act, providing the largest increase in college aid since the GI bill. He voted for the No Child Left Behind Act in 2001.

====Foreign policy====
On October 10, 2002, Boswell voted in favor of authorizing the invasion of Iraq.

====National security====
In 2001 Boswell voted for the USA PATRIOT Act, and for its reauthorization in 2005.

In 2008 he supported passing the FISA bill granting telecommunications companies immunity from prosecution for their involvement in warrantless wiretapping of American citizens. He sent a letter to Speaker Pelosi encouraging her not to fight the bill. He voted for the final House version of the bill once he was convinced it provided adequate protection for telecom companies.

====Gun rights====
Boswell, a strong proponent of gun rights in a state that supports the issue, wrote an op-ed in the local Council Bluffs newspaper criticizing Mitt Romney for flip-flopping on the issue of gun rights, an issue supported by local Iowans.

During Boswell&#x27;s 2010 re-election campaign, his views on gun rights and armed self-defense earned him an &quot;A&quot; rating from the NRA Political Victory Fund, which endorsed him over his (also &quot;A&quot;-rated) Republican rival.

====Subsidies and stimulus spending====
He has supported the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 and the 2009 stimulus bill. The Iowa Independent reported that the conservative group Crossroads GPS criticized Boswell&#x27;s vote approving the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The group, ran by Steven J. Law with ties to Karl Rove, had purchased $85,125 worth of TV time at KCCI, Des Moines local CBS channel targeting Boswell. Six weeks later, Crossroads GPS invested another $150,000 to the campaign. The money will be used to create and air two commercials.

==Political campaigns==
Boswell won the Democratic nomination for the 3rd District after 12-year Republican incumbent Jim Ross Lightfoot made an unsuccessful run for the United States Senate. He defeated Poweshiek County Attorney Mike Mahaffey by just over 4,000 votes. He was likely helped by Bill Clinton carrying the district, as well as the endorsement of the normally Republican-leaning Iowa Farm Bureau. He was handily reelected in 1998 and 2000. During his 2nd term, Boswell pledged to serve no more than 8 years. By 2004 he had reversed that pledge, stating that &quot;A thinking person is allowed to change their mind.&quot;

For his first three terms, Boswell represented a sprawling district that stretched from the Illinois border almost to the Nebraska border. However, his district was dismantled in the 2000s round of redistricting (even though Iowa didn&#x27;t lose any seats), and its territory was split among three other districts. Boswell&#x27;s home was shifted to the heavily Republican 5th District. Rather than face almost certain defeat, Boswell moved to Des Moines in the newly created 3rd District—thus making him technically the successor to Greg Ganske, who represented a Des Moines-based district from 1995 to 2003 and ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in 2002.

Boswell had a non-cancerous tumor removed from his stomach in 2005. The surgery and resulting recovery period caused him to be the most-absent member of Congress for the year. Rumors circulated that Democrats were looking to replace him on the ballot for 2006&#x27;s Congressional race against Iowa GOP Senate leader Jeff Lamberti, but Boswell&#x27;s return to work and apparent good health put an end to the speculation. He was reelected to his 7th term on November 4, 2008.

After the 2010 census, Boswell&#x27;s district was significantly redrawn. It now extended across the southwestern part of the state from Des Moines to Council Bluffs. He faced 4th District congressman Tom Latham in the 2012 election; Latham had been drawn into the same district as fellow Republican Steve King and opted to move to the 3rd. Talking about his re-election campaign, Boswell quipped, &quot;I&#x27;m running against Tom Latham, I think I&#x27;m running against Boehner, and there&#x27;s this guy called Karl Rove.&quot; Politico described the race between Boswell and Tom Latham, both incumbents faced off against each other as a result of redistricting, as one of ten bellwether races. At the end of the first quarter of 2012, Boswell trailed Latham substantially in both fundraising and cash on hand. Latham won the race, 52.4% to 43.7%.

==Personal life==
Boswell was a member of the Community of Christ. He has been married to Dody Boswell since 1956; they have three children. He also had another daughter from previous marriage. Boswell operated a farm in Davis City that has been in his family for several generations. He was a member of the board of directors for the Decatur County farmer&#x27;s cooperative from 1979 to 1993, serving for most of that time as president.

In July 2011, Boswell and his family were the victims of a home invasion. At about 10:45 p.m. on July 16, an armed man came through the front door of Boswell&#x27;s Iowa farmhouse, attacked his daughter, Cindy Brown, and demanded money. The Congressman struggled with the man until his grandson, Mitchell Brown, aimed a shotgun at the intruder, at which point the intruder fled the house into the surrounding fields.

Boswell died in Des Moines, Iowa on August 17, 2018, after suffering from complications of pseudomyxoma peritonei, a rare form of cancer, for over 13 years. His wife, Dody, died eight days later on August 25, 2018, the day of his funeral. Both were interred at Rose Hill Cemetery, in Lamoni, Iowa.

<text>Thomas Paul Latham (born July 14, 1948) is an American politician who served as a U.S. representative for Iowa from 1995 to 2015. He is a member of the Republican Party. On December 17, 2013, Latham announced he would not seek reelection next term, becoming the third member of the U.S. House to announce his retirement on the same day (along with Frank Wolf from Virginia and Jim Matheson from Utah).

==Early life and education==
Latham was born in Hampton, Iowa to Evelyn R. (née Johansen) and Willard Chester Latham. His father was of English and Danish descent and his mother was of Danish ancestry. He was raised on a farm in nearby Alexander. He attended Iowa State University, but did not graduate.

== Early career ==
Before entering the House, he was part-owner of Latham Seeds, a family-owned seed company founded by his father. Latham sold his interest before running for Congress.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
Latham was sworn in on January 3, 1995.
===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Appropriations
**Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies
**Subcommittee on Homeland Security
**Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies (Chairman)

===Leadership roles and caucus memberships===
*Co-chair, Congressional Hearing Health Caucus
*Congressional COPD Caucus
*Dean of Iowa&#x27;s delegation in the U.S. House of Representatives
*Task Force for a Drug-Free America
*Prescription Drug Action Leadership Team
*Congressional Task Force for Affordable Natural Gas
*National Service Caucus

==Political campaigns==

Latham was elected as the congressman for in 1994 as part of the wave that allowed Republicans to take over the House for the first time since 1955. The 5th was far and away the most Republican district in the state, and Latham never faced a serious challenge as the 5th District&#x27;s congressman. In 1994 he defeated Democrat Sheila McGuire garnering 61 percent of the vote. In 1996 he won 65 percent of the vote in defeating Democrat MacDonald Smith, and he ran unopposed in the 1998 election.

For his first four terms, Latham represented a district that stretched from Sioux City in the northwest all the way to Mason City on the other side of the state. The 2000 round of redistricting, however, significantly altered Iowa&#x27;s congressional map. Latham&#x27;s home in Alexander, along with most of the eastern third of his old district, was placed in the new 4th District in the north-central part of the state. This district was considered much more competitive than Latham&#x27;s old district. For the 2008 elections, it had a Cook Partisan Voting Index of D+0.4, making it one of the most marginal districts in the nation. However, he was reelected four times from this district without much difficulty. This may be because he is the only Iowan on the powerful House Appropriations Committee.

In the 2006 election, neither the Republican nor Democratic parties had a contested primary. His opponent in the 2006 general election was Selden Spencer, a neurologist from Huxley. Latham, who had moved to Ames, closer to the center of the district, earned 57.3% of the vote as he won reelection. In the 2008 election Latham won against Democratic nominee Becky Greenwald with 61 percent of the vote even as Barack Obama carried the district by eight points. In 2010, Latham won against Democratic nominee Bill Maske, a school administrator.

Iowa lost a district as a result of the 2010 census. The western third of Latham&#x27;s district—including his home in Ames and his former home in Alexander—was merged with the 5th District. This placed Latham in the same district as his successor in the 5th, fellow Republican Steve King.

The reconfigured district retained Latham&#x27;s district number, the 4th. It was also geographically more Latham&#x27;s district than King&#x27;s; he retained 55 percent of his former territory. Indeed, it closely resembled the territory that Latham had represented from 1995 to 2003. Nevertheless, he opted to run in the reconfigured 3rd District, which stretches from Des Moines to Council Bluffs. He sold his home in Ames and bought a home in Clive, a suburb of Des Moines. He defeated Democratic incumbent Leonard Boswell in the 2012 election.

On February 27, 2013, Latham announced that he would not seek the open Senate seat of Tom Harkin in 2014. Latham requested to have his salary withheld during the United States federal government shutdown of 2013.

<doc id="412937" wikidata="Q899834" url="?curid=412937" title="Teichoic acid">
<text>Teichoic acids (&quot;cf.&quot; Greek τεῖχος, &quot;teīkhos&quot;, &quot;wall&quot;, to be specific a fortification wall, as opposed to τοῖχος, &quot;toīkhos&quot;, a regular wall) are bacterial copolymers of glycerol phosphate or ribitol phosphate and carbohydrates linked via phosphodiester bonds.

Teichoic acids are found within the cell wall of most Gram-positive bacteria such as species in the genera &quot;Staphylococcus&quot;, &quot;Streptococcus&quot;, &quot;Bacillus&quot;, &quot;Clostridium&quot;, &quot;Corynebacterium&quot;, and &quot;Listeria&quot;, and appear to extend to the surface of the peptidoglycan layer. They can be covalently linked to &quot;N&quot;-acetylmuramic acid or a terminal -alanine in the tetrapeptide crosslinkage between &quot;N&quot;-acetylmuramic acid units of the peptidoglycan layer, or they can be anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane with a lipid anchor. Teichoic acid&#x27;s chemical signal is CH17P4O29NOH.

Teichoic acids that are anchored to the lipid membrane are referred to as [[lipoteichoic acid]]s (LTAs), whereas teichoic acids that are covalently bound to peptidoglycan are referred to as wall teichoic acids (WTA).

== Structure ==
The most common structure of Wall teichoic acids are a ManNAc(β1→4)GlcNAc disaccharide with one to three glycerol phosphates attached to the C4 hydroxyl of the ManNAc residue followed by a long chain of glycerol- or ribitol phosphate repeats. Variations come in the long chain tail, which generally include sugar subunits being attached to the sides or the body of the repeats. Four types of WTA repeats have been named, as of 2013.

Lipoteichoic acids follow a similar pattern of putting most variation in the repeats, although the set of enzymes used are different, at least in the case of Type I LTA. The repeats are anchored onto the membrane via a (di)glucosyl-diacylglycerol (Glc(2)DAG) anchor. Type IV LTA from &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; represents a special case where both types intersect: after the tail is synthesized with an undecaprenyl phosphate (C55-P) intermediate &quot;head&quot;, different TagU/LCP (LytR-CpsA-Psr) family enzymes either attaches it to the wall to form a WTA or to the GlcDAG anchor.

== Function ==
The main function of teichoic acids is to provide flexibility to the cell-wall by attracting cations such as calcium and potassium. Teichoic acids can be substituted with -alanine ester residues, or -glucosamine, giving the molecule zwitterionic properties. These zwitterionic teichoic acids are suspected ligands for toll-like receptors 2 and 4. Teichoic acids also assist in regulation of cell growth by limiting the ability of autolysins to break the β(1-4) bond between the &quot;N&quot;-acetyl glucosamine and the &quot;N&quot;-acetylmuramic acid.

Lipoteichoic acids may also act as receptor molecules for some Gram-positive bacteriophage; however, this has not yet been conclusively supported.
It is an acidic polymer and contributes negative charge to the cell wall.

==Biosynthesis==

=== WTA and Type IV LTA ===
Enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of WTAs have been named: TarO, TarA, TarB, TarF, TarK, and TarL. Their roles are:
* TarO (, EC 2.7.8.33) starts off the process by connecting GlcNAc to a biphospho-undecaprenyl (bactoprenyl) in the inner membrane.
* TarA (, EC 2.4.1.187) connects a ManNAc to the UDP-GlcNac formed by TarO via a β-(1,4) linkage.
* TarB (, EC 2.7.8.44) connects a single glycerol-3-phosphate to the C4 hydroxyl of ManNAc.
* TarF (, EC 2.7.8.12) connects more glycerol-3-phosphate units to the glycerol tail. In Tag-producing bacteria, this is the final step (a long glycerol tail). Otherwise it only adds one unit.
* TarK (, EC 2.7.8.46) connects the initial ribitol-5-phosphate unit. It is necessary in &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; W23 for Tar production, but &quot;S. aureus&quot; has both functions in the same TarL/K enzyme.
* TarL (, EC 2.7.8.47) constructs the long ribitol-5-phosphate tail.

Following the synthesis, the ATP-binding cassette transporters (teichoic-acid-transporting ATPase) TarGH (, ) flip the cytoplasmic complex to the external surface of the inner membrane. The redundant TagTUV enzymes link this product to the cell wall. The enzymes TarI () and TarJ () are responsible for producing the substrates that lead to the polymer tail. Many of these proteins are located in a conserved gene cluster.

Later (2013) studies have identified a few more enzymes that attach unique sugars to the WTA repeat units. A set of enzymes and transporters named DltABCE that adds alanines to both wall and lipo-teichoic acids were found.

Note that the set of genes are named &quot;Tag&quot; (teichoic acid glycerol) instead of &quot;Tar&quot; (teichoic acid ribitol) in &quot;B. subtilis&quot; 168, which lacks the TarK/TarL enzymes. TarB/F/L/K all bear some similarities to each other, and belong to the same family (). Due to the role of &quot;B. subtilis&quot; as the main model strain, some linked UniProt entries are in fact the &quot;Tag&quot; ortholog as they are better annotated. The &quot;similarity search&quot; may be used to access the genes in the Tar-producing &quot;B. substilis&quot; W23 (BACPZ).

==As an antibiotic drug target==
This was proposed in 2004. A further review in 2013 has given more specific parts of the pathways to inhibit given newer knowledge.

<text>Steven Arnold King (born May 28, 1949) is an American former politician and businessman who served as a U.S. representative from Iowa from 2003 to 2021. A member of the Republican Party, he represented Iowa&#x27;s 5th congressional district until 2013 and the state&#x27;s 4th congressional district from 2013 to 2021.

Born in 1949 in Storm Lake, Iowa, King attended Northwest Missouri State University from 1967 to 1970. He founded a construction company in 1975 and worked in business and environmental study before seeking the Republican nomination for a seat in the Iowa Senate in 1996. He won the primary and the general election, and was reelected in 2000. In 2002 King was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from Iowa&#x27;s 5th congressional district after the incumbent, Tom Latham, was reassigned to the 4th district after redistricting. He was reelected four times before the 2010 United States Census removed the 5th district and placed King in the 4th, which he represented from 2013.

King is an opponent of immigration and multiculturalism, and has a long history of racist and anti-immigrant rhetoric and white nationalist affiliations. In 2018 &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described King as &quot;the Congressman most openly affiliated with white nationalism.&quot; King has been criticized for his affiliation with white supremacist ideas, made controversial statements against immigrants, and supported European right-wing populist and far-right politicians who have engaged in racism, anti-Semitism and Islamophobia.

For much of King&#x27;s congressional tenure, Republican politicians and officials were silent about his rhetoric, and frequently sought his endorsement and campaigned with him because of his popularity with northwest Iowa&#x27;s voters. Shortly before the 2018 election, the National Republican Congressional Committee withdrew funding for King&#x27;s reelection campaign and its chairman, Steve Stivers, condemned King&#x27;s conduct, although Iowa&#x27;s Republican senators and governor continued to endorse him. King was narrowly reelected, but after a January 2019 interview in which he questioned the negative connotations of the terms &quot;white nationalist&quot; and &quot;white supremacy&quot;, he was widely condemned by both parties, the media, and public figures, and the Republican Steering Committee removed him from all House committee assignments. King ran for reelection but, campaign funding and support having declined, lost the June 2020 Republican primary to Randy Feenstra by 10 points.

==Personal life, education, and business career==
King was born on May 28, 1949, in Storm Lake, Iowa, the son of Mildred Lila (née Culler), a homemaker, and Emmett A. King, a state police dispatcher. His father has Irish and German ancestry, and his mother has Welsh roots, as well as American ancestry going back to the colonial era. His grandmother was a German immigrant. King graduated in 1967 from Denison Community High School. In 1972, he married Marilyn Kelly, with whom he has three children. Though raised Methodist, King attends his wife&#x27;s Catholic church, having converted 17 years after marrying her. His son Jeff King, a consultant, has been active in his political campaigns.

King attended Northwest Missouri State University from 1967 to 1970, where he was a member of the Alpha Kappa Lambda fraternity and majored in math and biology, but did not graduate. In 1975, King founded King Construction, an earthmoving company. In the 1980s, he founded the Kiron Business Association. King&#x27;s involvement with the Iowa Land Improvement Contractors&#x27; Association led to regional and national offices in that organization and a growing interest in public policy.

==Iowa State Senate (1997–2003)==
In 1996, King was elected to Iowa&#x27;s 6th Senate district, defeating incumbent senator Wayne Bennett in the primary 68%–31% and Democrat Eileen Heiden in the general election 64%–35%. In 2000, he won reelection to a second term, defeating Democratic nominee Dennis Ryan 70%–30%. During his tenure in the Iowa State Senate, King filed a bill requiring public schools to teach children that the U.S. &quot;is the unchallenged greatest nation in the world and that it has derived its strength from... Christianity, free enterprise capitalism and Western civilization&quot;, and served as chief sponsor of a law making English the official language of Iowa.

==U.S. House of Representatives (2003–2021)==

===Elections===
;2002

In 2002, after redistricting, King ran for the open seat in Iowa&#x27;s 5th congressional district. The incumbent, fellow Republican Tom Latham, had his home drawn into the reconfigured 4th district. King finished first in the four-way Republican primary with 31% of the vote, less than the 35% voting threshold needed to win; subsequently, a nominating convention was held, at which he was nominated, defeating state house speaker Brent Siegrist 51%–47%. King won the general election, defeating Council Bluffs city councilman Paul Shomshor 62%–38%. He won all the counties in the predominantly Republican district except Pottawattamie.

;2004
King won reelection to a second term, defeating Democratic candidate Joyce Schulte, 63%–37%. He won all the counties in the district except Clarke.

;2006

In 2006, King won reelection to a third term, defeating Schulte again, 59%–36%. He won all the counties in the district except Clarke and Union.

;2008

King won reelection to a fourth term, defeating Democratic candidate Rob Hubler, 60%–37%. For the first time in his career he won all 32 counties in his district.

;2010

King won reelection to a fifth term, defeating Matt Campbell, 66%–32%. That was his highest percentage yet. King also won all 32 counties again.

;2012

Iowa lost a district as a result of the 2010 census. King&#x27;s district was renumbered the 4th, and pushed well to the east, absorbing Mason City and Ames. This placed King and his predecessor, Latham, in the same district. Latham opted to move to the reconfigured 3rd District to challenge Democratic incumbent Leonard Boswell. The reconfigured district was, at least on paper, much more competitive than King&#x27;s old district. The old 5th had a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+9, while the new 4th had a PVI of R+4. The new 4th was also mostly new to King; he retained only 45% of his former territory. It closely resembled the territory that Latham had represented from 1995 to 2003.

Soon afterward, former Iowa first lady Christie Vilsack, the wife of former governor and then current U.S. agriculture secretary Tom Vilsack, announced she was moving to the new 4th to challenge King. King received the endorsement of Mitt Romney, who said, &quot;I&#x27;m looking here at Steve King because this man needs to be your congressman again. I want him as my partner in Washington, D.C.&quot; King won reelection to a sixth term, defeating Vilsack 53%–45%. King won all but seven counties, none of which he had previously represented: Webster, Boone, Story, Chickasaw, Floyd, Cerro Gordo, and Winnebago. King later said of his 2012 victory, &quot;I faced $7 million, the best of everything Democrats can throw at me, their dream candidate and everything that can come from the Obama machine, and prevailed through all of that with 55 percent of my district that was new.&quot;

;2014

On May 3, 2013, King announced that he would not run for the U.S. Senate in 2014.

King won reelection with 61.6% of the vote, defeating Democratic candidate Jim Mowrer.

;2016

King won reelection, receiving 61.2% of the vote to Democratic nominee Kim Weaver&#x27;s 38.6%.

;2018
King faced his closest race to date in 2018, receiving 50.4% of the vote to 47% for Democratic nominee J. D. Scholten; Libertarian candidate Charles Aldrich received 2%. King likely prevailed due to Governor Kim Reynolds carrying the district with almost 61 percent of the vote in her bid for a full term. Turnout was down from the 2016 election; 370,259 voted in 2016, compared to 313,251 in 2018.

It was the closest a Democrat has come to winning what is now the 4th since Berkley Bedell left office in what was then the 6th District in 1986. That year, Republican Fred Grandy won with only 50.1 percent of the vote. Since then, the only other time a Republican has not won election by double digits in this district (which became the 5th in 1993 and the 4th in 2013) was King&#x27;s 2012 race against Vilsack.

;2020

In the wake of being stripped of his committee seats, King faced a credible primary challenger in State Senator Randy Feenstra, who represented much of the district&#x27;s northwest portion. Feenstra outraised King by a significant margin. Ultimately, King lost to Feenstra, taking 36.7 percent of the vote to Feenstra&#x27;s 45.7 percent.

===Tenure===
King is considered an outspoken fiscal and social conservative. After winning the 2002 Republican nomination, he said that he intended to use his seat in Congress to &quot;move the political center of gravity in Congress to the right.&quot; During the 110th Congress, King voted with the majority of the Republican Party 90.9% of the time. He has continuously voted for Iraq War legislation, supported surge efforts and opposed a time table for troop withdrawals. During the 112th United States Congress King was one of 40 &quot;staunch&quot; members of the Republican Study Committee who frequently voted against Republican party leadership and vocally expressed displeasure with House bills. In August 2015, King was named the least effective member of Congress by InsideGov due to his persistent failures to get legislation out of committee. On December 18, 2019, King voted against both articles of impeachment against Trump, as did all 195 Republicans who voted.

==== Committee assignments ====
King served on the Judiciary, Agriculture, and Small Business Committees until January 14, 2019, when he was removed from all committee assignments after bipartisan condemnation of his remarks on white supremacy.

==Political positions==
===Abortion===
King opposes abortion. He has a 100% rating from the National Right to Life Committee, indicating an anti-abortion voting record. King has also voted against allowing human embryonic stem cell research. He supports the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, which would ban federal funding of abortions except in cases of what the bill calls &quot;forcible rape&quot;. This would remove the coverage from Medicaid that covers abortions for victims of statutory rape or incest.

After Todd Akin made a controversial statement about &quot;legitimate rape&quot; on August 19, 2012, King came to his defense, characterizing the critical response as &quot;petty personal attacks&quot; and calling Akin a &quot;strong Christian man&quot;. King said that Akin&#x27;s voting record should be more important than his words. Six months later, King&#x27;s defense of Akin (who lost his race) was seen as politically damaging by Steven J. Law of the Conservative Victory Project, a group including Karl Rove that was working to discourage conservative candidates they deemed unelectable, to enable more viable conservative candidates to gain office. Law said, &quot;We&#x27;re concerned about Steve King&#x27;s Todd Akin problem.&quot;

King sponsored legislation to ban abortion of a fetus that has a detectable heartbeat, which can in some cases occur as early as 6 weeks (before many women know they are pregnant). A physician who performs a prohibited abortion would be subject to a fine, up to five years in prison, or both. A woman who undergoes a prohibited abortion could not be prosecuted for violating the provisions of this bill.

In August 2019, while defending his opposition to abortion in cases of rape or incest, King asked, &quot;What if we went back through all the family trees and just pulled out anyone who was a product of rape or incest? Would there be any population of the world left if we did that?&quot; Iowa State Senator Randy Feenstra, who went on to defeat King in the 2020 Republican primary, tweeted: &quot;I am 100% pro-life but Steve King&#x27;s bizarre comments and behavior diminish our message &amp; damage our cause&quot;. Wyoming representative Liz Cheney called King&#x27;s comments &quot;appalling and bizarre&quot; and called for his resignation. King&#x27;s comments were also criticized by Steve Scalise, Kevin McCarthy, Donald Trump, and Elise Jordan.

===Animal rights===
In February 2010, King tweeted about chasing and shooting a raccoon that had tried to enter his house during a blizzard, prompting criticism from animal rights groups. He defended his actions, saying the animal might have been rabid.

In July 2012, King opposed the McGovern Amendment (to the 2012 Farm Bill) to establish misdemeanor penalties for knowingly attending an organized animal fight and felony penalties for bringing a minor to such a fight. He was also one of 39 House members to vote against an upgrade of penalties for transporting fighting animals across state lines in 2007. King received a score of zero on the 2012 Humane Society Legislative Fund&#x27;s &quot;Humane Scorecard&quot;. Afterward, he put out a video clarifying his position, stating that it would be putting animals above humans if it were legal to watch humans fight but not animals. The issue prompted a feature segment on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; criticizing King&#x27;s reasoning. The main differences cited between human combat sports and dogfights were the ability to choose to participate and the consequences of losing a match.

On September 24, 2010, comedian Stephen Colbert testified to the House Agriculture Committee about the working conditions of migrant farmworkers. King said he wanted to eliminate them, replacing them with &quot;everyday American workers&quot;. He also said, &quot;Maybe we should be spending less time watching Comedy Central and more time considering all the real jobs that are out there, ones that require real hard labor&quot;. He praised the &quot;Joe the Plumbers of the world who many days would prefer the aroma of fresh dirt to that of the sewage from American elitists who disparage them even as they flush.&quot; Colbert, in his faux-conservative character, lampooned King. &quot;This is America! I don&#x27;t want a tomato picked by a Mexican! I want it picked by an American, then sliced by a Guatemalan, and served by a Venezuelan in a spa where a Chilean gives me a Brazilian.&quot;

In July 2012, King introduced an amendment to the House Farm Bill that would legalize previously banned animal agriculture practices such as tail-docking, using banned arsenic-based drugs in chicken feed, and keeping impregnated pigs in small crates. &quot;My language wipes out everything they&#x27;ve done with pork and veal,&quot; King said of his amendment. The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) President Wayne Pacelle said the measure could nullify &quot;any laws to protect animals, and perhaps ... laws to protect the environment, workers, or public safety.&quot;

In May 2013, King introduced another amendment to the House Farm Bill, the Protect Interstate Commerce Act (PICA), saying, &quot;PICA blocks states from requiring &#x27;free range&#x27; eggs or &#x27;free range&#x27; pork.&quot; In 2014, the controversial provision was dropped.

===Climate change===
King has dismissed concern over global warming, calling it a &quot;religion&quot; and claiming efforts to address climate change are useless. A day after claiming that climate change was more &quot;a religion than a science,&quot; he reasserted that many scientists overreact when discussing the consequences of global warming, saying, &quot;Everything that might result from a warmer planet is always bad in [environmentalists&#x27;] analysis. There will be more photosynthesis going on if the Earth gets warmer ... And if sea levels go up 4 or 6 inches, I don&#x27;t know if we&#x27;d know that. We don&#x27;t know where sea level is even, let alone be able to say that it&#x27;s going to come up an inch globally because some polar ice caps might melt because there&#x27;s  suspended in the atmosphere.&quot;

===Elections===

King endorsed Ted Cruz in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, saying Cruz was the &quot;answer to my prayers&quot;. He endorsed and strongly supported Donald Trump after Trump won the nomination.

In December 2020, King was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives who signed an amicus brief in support of &quot;Texas v. Pennsylvania&quot;, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden prevailed over incumbent Donald Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of the election held by another state.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement that called signing the amicus brief an act of &quot;election subversion.&quot; Additionally, Pelosi reprimanded King and the other House members who supported the lawsuit: &quot;The 126 Republican Members that signed onto this lawsuit brought dishonor to the House. Instead of upholding their oath to support and defend the Constitution, they chose to subvert the Constitution and undermine public trust in our sacred democratic institutions.&quot; New Jersey Representative Bill Pascrell, citing section three of the 14th Amendment, called for Pelosi to not seat the other Republicans who signed the brief supporting the suit. Pascrell argued that &quot;the text of the 14th Amendment expressly forbids Members of Congress from engaging in rebellion against the United States. Trying to overturn a democratic election and install a dictator seems like a pretty clear example of that.&quot;

=== Fiscal policy ===
Objecting to &quot;taxpayer-funded subsidies, pet projects and added bureaucracy&quot;, King voted against The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 in the U.S. House of Representatives, saying, &quot;Our economy will not recover because government spends more. It will recover because people produce more.&quot; King also stood out as one of only 11 members of Congress to vote against the $51.8 billion Hurricane Katrina relief package in 2005, claiming there was no comprehensive plan for spending the aid money.

===Gun rights===
King opposes stricter regulations on gun ownership. In 2017, King said that a bill to close the so-called &quot;gun show loophole&quot; and add background checks for individuals who bought guns at gun shows would ruin &quot;Christmas at the Kings&#x27;&quot; if it passed. In 2018, King criticized 18-year-old Parkland high school shooting survivor X González, attempting to tie González to Communist Cuba. In 2018, he said that easy access to guns should not be blamed for gun violence, but rather video games, cultural changes, lack of prayer in schools, gun-free zones, family break-ups, and the stimulant medication Ritalin.

===Healthcare===
King is a staunch opponent of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and has led attempts to repeal it. He fought against Medicare and Medicaid covering a number of medications such as Viagra, which he called &quot;recreational drugs&quot;.

In January 2017, King said that in the wake of the 2016 presidential election, &quot;it has become abundantly clear that the American people have overwhelmingly rejected Obamacare time and time again&quot; and called for congressional Republicans to &quot;take swift action to fulfill our promise to We the People and repeal this unconstitutional and egregious law passed by hook, crook and legislative shenanigan.&quot; In May 2017, King said he had moved from supporting the American Health Care Act, the Republican replacement to the Affordable Care Act, to being unsure as a result of benefits such as emergency services, hospitalization and prescription drugs that were added following his backing of the measure: &quot;Once they negotiated [essential health benefits] with the Freedom Caucus and Tuesday Group, it is hard for me to imagine they will bring that language in the Senate, or that it will be effective because they diluted this thing substantially.&quot; King added that he and Trump agreed on the need for the federal government to not have a role in health insurance and that Republicans would not have had difficulty repealing the Affordable Care Act had the party prioritized its replacement within the first week of the 115th Congress, in January 2015.

===LGBT rights===
On April 3, 2009, the Iowa Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Varnum v. Brien&quot; unanimously that a state ban on same-sex marriage violated Iowa&#x27;s constitution. King soon commented that the justices &quot;should resign from their position&quot; and the state legislature &quot;must also enact marriage license residency requirements so that Iowa does not become the gay marriage Mecca.&quot; King, along with others, mounted a campaign against the three Iowa Supreme Court justices who were up for retention and had ruled on the gay marriage case. King bought $80,000 of radio advertising across the state calling for Iowans to vote against their retention. None of the three was retained.

On October 7, 2014, King was one of 19 members of Congress inducted into the LGBT civil rights advocacy group Human Rights Campaign&#x27;s &quot;Hall of Shame&quot; for his opposition to LGBT equality.

In response to the Supreme Court&#x27;s 2015 decision &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot;, in which the court ruled that same-sex marriage is a constitutionally protected right, King called for a non-binding resolution saying that states may refuse to recognize the decision. He has also called for the abolition of civil marriage. On May 17, 2019, King was one of 173 representatives to vote against the Equality Act.

===Lobbying===
On February 26, 2010, King went to the House floor to protest Democrats&#x27; handling of health care reform and said, &quot;Lobbyists do a very effective and useful job on this Hill ... There&#x27;s a credibility there in that arena that I think somebody needs to stand up for the lobby, and it is a matter of providing a lot of valuable information.&quot;

===Immigration===
King voted against the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020 which authorizes DHS to nearly double the available H-2B visas for the remainder of FY 2020.

King voted against Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1158) which effectively prohibits ICE from cooperating with Health and Human Services to detain or remove illegal alien sponsors of unaccompanied alien children (UACs).

King is a proponent of the Great Replacement theory, the theory states that the white population is being replaced by mass non-white immigrants.

== Controversial comments ==

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; has described King as &quot;the U.S. congressman most openly affiliated with white nationalism&quot;, while &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; has said his opinions in this direction are &quot;barely veiled&quot;. David Leonhardt in an opinion piece for &quot;The New York Times&quot; has explicitly identified King as being a &quot;white nationalist&quot;. King has stirred controversy and come to prominence by making statements that have been described as racist or racially charged. He is a staunch opponent of immigration and multiculturalism, and has supported far-right European politicians. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, King &quot;has long been one of the most vociferously anti-immigration members of the House Republican caucus.&quot; King has said that he is not a racist.

In October 2018, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, Steve Stivers, condemned King as a racist, saying that King&#x27;s actions and comments were &quot;completely inappropriate&quot; and constituted &quot;white supremacy and hate.&quot; The NRCC said it would not help King in his 2018 re-election efforts. Representative Carlos Curbelo described King&#x27;s comments and actions as &quot;disgusting&quot; and said that he would never vote for someone like King. Senator Ted Cruz called King&#x27;s rhetoric &quot;divisive&quot; but stopped short of condemning him. Other Republicans, such as House Agriculture Committee Chairman Mike Conaway, dismissed the idea that King is racist.

In a January 2019 interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, King asked, &quot;White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization—how did that language become offensive?&quot; He also said of the large increase in representation of minorities and women in the new Democrat-controlled House: &quot;You could look over there and think the Democratic Party is no country for white men.&quot; He was subsequently condemned by numerous Republican members of Congress, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and other members of the House Republican leadership. U.S. Senator Tim Scott criticized King harshly in a &quot;Washington Post&quot; op-ed, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called King&#x27;s remarks &quot;unwelcome and unworthy of his elected position&quot;. Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro called for King to be censured and for a primary challenge against King. After the interview was published, and following backlash from across the political spectrum, King issued a statement via Twitter stating that he was &quot;simply a Nationalist&quot;, that he did not advocate for &quot;white nationalism and white supremacy&quot;, and that &quot;I want to make one thing abundantly clear: I reject those labels and the evil ideology they define.&quot; King said &quot;The New York Times&quot; had misunderstood his comments, and that he did not question why &quot;white nationalist&quot; and &quot;white supremacist&quot; were offensive terms. On Twitter, he later stated: &quot;As I told &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &#x27;it&#x27;s not about race; It&#x27;s never been about race&#x27;.&quot; The House voted 416–1 to rebuke King&#x27;s comments; Illinois Representative Bobby Rush was the lone &quot;nay&quot; vote, but only because he believed a rebuke was too lenient and that King deserved to be censured.

=== Immigration and multiculturalism ===
King is a staunch opponent of immigration and multiculturalism.

In April 2006, when asked if &quot;the US economy simply couldn&#x27;t function without&quot; the presence of illegal immigrants, King said that he rejected that position &quot;categorically&quot;. He said the 77.5 million people between the ages of 16 and 65 in the United States who are not part of the workforce &quot;could be put to work and we could invent machines to replace the rest.&quot; In 2006, King called for an electrified fence on the US border, commenting that such fences were successful in containing livestock.

In July 2013, speaking about proposed immigration legislation, King said of illegal immigrants: &quot;For every one who&#x27;s a valedictorian, there&#x27;s another 100 out there who weigh 130 pounds—and they&#x27;ve got calves the size of cantaloupes because they&#x27;re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert.&quot; Despite strong rebukes from both Democrats and other Republicans, including House Speaker John Boehner, who called his statements &quot;ignorant&quot; and &quot;hateful&quot;, and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, who called the comments &quot;inexcusable&quot;, King defended his comments, saying he got the description from the border patrol.

In July 2015, referencing HUD secretary Julián Castro&#x27;s remarks on how poorly the Republican Party was doing with Hispanic voters, King responded, &quot;What does Julian Castro know? Does he know that I&#x27;m as Hispanic and Latino as he?&quot; King is neither Hispanic nor Latino by either family history or ethnic definition.

In 2016, a journalist for the &quot;Iowa Starting Line&quot; reported that King displayed the Confederate flag on his office desk, although Iowa was part of the Union during the American Civil War. He removed it after a Confederate flag-waver later fatally shot two Iowa police officers. King attempted to block a bill that would remove Andrew Jackson and replace him with Harriet Tubman on the twenty-dollar bill. King praised Bernie Sanders numerous times for his view on immigration, saying they were &quot;closer to mine than it is some of the presidential candidates on the Republican side.&quot;

In March 2017, King wrote &quot;culture and demographics are our destiny. We can&#x27;t restore our civilization with somebody else&#x27;s babies.&quot; When asked about his comments, King stood by them, saying: &quot;you need to teach your children your values&quot; and &quot;with the inter-marriage, I&#x27;d like to see an America that is just so homogenous that we look a lot the same&quot;. King was rebuked by members of his own party, including Speaker Paul D. Ryan, but praised by white supremacist David Duke and &quot;The Daily Stormer&quot;, a neo-Nazi website.

In July 2017, the House Appropriations Committee voted to fund the US-Mexico border wall, allocating $1.6 billion for it. King called for an additional $5 billion for the wall, to be paid for with federal dollars coming from Planned Parenthood, food stamps, and other federal welfare programs, saying, &quot;I would find half of a billion of dollars of that right out of Planned Parenthood&#x27;s budget, and the rest of it could come out of food stamps and the entitlements that are being spread out for people who have not worked in three generations.&quot;

On November 5, 2018, King referred to Mexican immigrants as &quot;dirt&quot; while at a campaign stop. &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; reported the comment; King denied saying it and called on &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; to release audio of the remarks. &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; then released a recording of the exchange, confirming that King had made the remarks. In May 2019, King warned against &quot;presuming that every culture is equal&quot;. On September 4, 2019, King posted a video of himself drinking water from water fountains over toilets at migrant facilities. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez criticized the GOP as &quot;anti-immigrant&quot; following the video.

=== President Barack Obama ===
On March 7, 2008, during his press engagements to announce his reelection campaign, King made remarks about then U.S. senator and Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and his middle name &quot;Hussein&quot;, saying:

I don&#x27;t want to disparage anyone because of their race, their ethnicity, their name—whatever their religion their father might have been, I&#x27;ll just say this: When you think about the optics of a Barack Obama potentially getting elected President of the United States—I mean, what does this look like to the rest of the world? What does it look like to the world of Islam? I will tell you that, if he is elected president, then the radical Islamists, the al-Qaida, the radical Islamists and their supporters, will be dancing in the streets in greater numbers than they did on September 11.
On March 10, King defended his comments to the Associated Press, saying &quot;[Obama will] certainly be viewed as a savior for them... That&#x27;s why you will see them supporting him, encouraging him.&quot;

Obama said he did not take the comments too seriously, describing King as a person who thrives on making controversial statements to get media coverage. He said, &quot;I would hope [Obama&#x27;s opponent] Senator [John] McCain would want to distance himself from that kind of inflammatory and offensive remarks.&quot; The McCain campaign disavowed King&#x27;s comments, saying &quot;John McCain rejects the type of politics that degrades our civics... and obviously that extends to Congressman King&#x27;s statement.&quot;

In mid-January 2009, King acknowledged that terrorists were not dancing in the streets, and had made statements opposing Obama. He said he found Obama&#x27;s decision to use his middle name &quot;Hussein&quot; when sworn in as the 44th President of the United States to be &quot;bizarre&quot; and &quot;a double standard&quot;.

In 2010, King speculated that Obama&#x27;s immigration policies were influenced by racial favoritism toward black people.

In February 2020 on Twitter, King insinuated former DHS official Philip Haney had been murdered as a reprisal for &quot;archiving data that incriminated the highest levels of the Obama administration&quot;.

===Racial profiling===
On June 14, 2010, King said on the House floor that racial profiling is an important component of law enforcement: &quot;Some claim that the Arizona law will bring about racial discrimination profiling. First let me say, Mr. Speaker, that profiling has always been an important component of legitimate law enforcement. If you can&#x27;t profile someone, you can&#x27;t use those common sense indicators that are before your very eyes. Now, I think it&#x27;s wrong to use racial profiling for the reasons of discriminating against people, but it&#x27;s not wrong to use race or other indicators for the sake of identifying people that are violating the law.&quot; As an example of profiling, King described an instance when a taxi driver would stop for him before he had to hail a cab, just because he was in a business suit.

The same day, on G. Gordon Liddy&#x27;s radio program, King said that Obama&#x27;s policies favored black people: &quot;The president has demonstrated that he has a default mechanism in him that breaks down the side of race—on the side that favors the black person in the case of Professor Gates and Officer Crowley.&quot; On January 13, 2018, King tweeted that racial oppression was a &quot;thing of the past&quot;.

=== Comments on Western civilization ===
On July 18, 2016, King participated in a panel discussion on MSNBC, during which a panelist from &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine suggested that the 2016 convention could be the last in which &quot;old white people would command the Republican Party&#x27;s attention&quot;. King responded, &quot;This whole &#x27;old white people&#x27; business does get a little tired, Charlie. I&#x27;d ask you to go back through history and figure out where are these contributions that have been made by these other categories of people that you are talking about? Where did any other subgroup of people contribute more to civilization?&quot; Panel moderator Chris Hayes later described King&#x27;s comments as odious and preposterous. Panel member April Ryan described them as &quot;in-my-face racism&quot;. That evening, King was asked about his comments during an interview with ABC News. King said he had meant to say that &quot;Western civilization&quot;, rather than &quot;white people&quot;, is the &quot;superior culture&quot;: &quot;when you describe Western civilization, that can mean much of Western civilization happens to be Caucasians. But we should not apologize for our culture or our civilization. The contributions that were made by Western civilization itself, and by Americans, by Americans of all races, stand far above the rest of the world. The Western civilization and the American civilization are a superior culture.&quot;

===Attitudes towards Muslims===
In September 2014, King called for the Obama administration to begin surveilling mosques to monitor recruitment to ISIS. Although &quot;BuzzFeed News&quot; said there was no evidence of such recruitment, King claimed it was occurring in parts of the United States. On December 9, 2015, he told MSNBC that he agreed with his party that Islam is &quot;incompatible&quot; with American life. In an interview with &quot;Breitbart News&quot;, King said he did not want Muslims working in meat-packing plants, because &quot;I don&#x27;t want people doing my pork that won&#x27;t eat it, let alone hope I go to hell for eating pork chops.&quot; On March 7, 2019, he voted &quot;present&quot; on a resolution the US House passed condemning anti-Semitism and anti-Muslim discrimination. On August 27, 2019, King joked about Uyghur Muslims detained in China&#x27;s Xinjiang internment camps being forced to eat pork.

=== Abuse at Abu Ghraib prison ===
In May 2004, King compared the torture and prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib prison to &quot;hazing&quot;. He argued that violence against American soldiers in Iraq was more extreme than the prisoner 
abuse, saying that comparing the two was like comparing the crimes &quot;committed by Jeffrey Dahmer compared to those of Heidi Fleiss&quot;, and that &quot;if Tom Harkin and his Democrat allies want to continue to act like political cannibals and pitch partisan hooey to anyone who&#x27;ll listen, then they&#x27;re eating their own.&quot;

=== Affirmative action ===
King opposes affirmative action. He has said: &quot;There&#x27;s been legislation that&#x27;s been brought through this House that sets aside benefits for women and minorities. The only people that it excludes are white men... Pretty soon, white men are going to notice they are the ones being excluded.&quot; In 2015, King introduced a bill that would require colleges to report affirmative action.

=== Support for far-right politics ===
On March 12, 2017, King expressed his support for Geert Wilders, a far-right Dutch politician known for his anti-Islam views, leading up to the election in the Netherlands, stating, &quot;Wilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny&quot; and &quot;We can&#x27;t restore our civilization with somebody else&#x27;s babies,&quot; referring to his views on ending birthright citizenship and promoting &quot;an America that&#x27;s just so homogenous that we look a lot [sic] the same.&quot; His statements received criticism from other politicians, including several Republicans, with Jeb Bush responding that &quot;America is a nation of immigrants&quot;; despite the backlash, King defended his statements. Others reported that King&#x27;s statements were well received among white nationalists, garnering support from prominent members of that community. The next day on CNN, King said he was referring to culture, not ethnicity, saying: &quot;It&#x27;s the culture, not the blood. If you can go anywhere in the world and adopt these babies and put them into households that were already assimilated in America, those babies will grow up as American as any other baby with as much patriotism and love of country as any other baby.&quot; Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke praised King&#x27;s statement.

King supported French right-wing populist politician, leader of the Front National Marine Le Pen in the French 2017 presidential election. He sent her a message stating: &quot;Our shared civilization must be saved&quot;.

King supported Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, a right-wing populist and strong opponent of admitting migrants during the European migrant crisis. On December 8, 2017, King tweeted Orbán&#x27;s quote that &quot;Diversity is not our strength. Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban , &#x27;Mixing cultures will not lead to a higher quality of life but a lower one&#x27;.&quot; &quot;Assimilation has become a dirty word to the multiculturalist Left. Assimilation, not diversity, is our American strength,&quot; he tweeted.

In June 2018, he retweeted a comment by Mark Collett, a British neo-Nazi and self-described admirer of Hitler, about Europe &quot;waking up&quot; to mass immigration.

On August 24, 2018, King was interviewed by the Austrian website &quot;&quot; (&quot;Uncensored&quot;), which is connected to the country&#x27;s Freedom Party, part of the First Kurz government. He agreed with the interviewer that American financier George Soros is involved with the &quot;Great Replacement&quot;, a far-right conspiracy theory that claims to have identified a plot to replace white Europeans with minorities and immigrants.

King also endorsed right-wing Canadian political commentator Faith Goldy in the 2018 Toronto mayoral election. Goldy participated in a neo-Nazi podcast and has been described as far-right or alt-right. In response to the Goldy endorsement, and King&#x27;s other racially contentious remarks, Minnesota-based agricultural cooperative Land O&#x27;Lakes ended its support for his reelection.

In February 2021, after he left office, it was announced that he would be a speaker at Nick Fuentes&#x27; America First Political Action Conference.

=== White genocide ===
King subscribes to the white genocide conspiracy theory, and has stated this view while in Congress. &quot;Mother Jones&quot; and other media have reported more generally on his belief in and promotion of the conspiracy theory. In 2018, King spoke to an Austrian far-right publication about &quot;the great replacement&quot;, which &quot;The New York Times&quot; described as &quot;a conspiracy theory on the far right that claims shadowy elites are working behind the scenes to reduce white populations to minorities in their own countries.&quot; The theory gained notoriety after the alleged perpetrator of the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings titled his manifesto after it.

=== Antisemitism controversy in 2018 ===
In late October 2018, after the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) sent the House speaker, Paul Ryan, an open letter calling on him to censure King, citing King&#x27;s relationship with far-right Freedom Party of Austria and other far-right groups in Europe. The letter accused King of engaging in antisemitic smearing of the Jewish investor and philanthropist George Soros. It concluded, &quot;Rep. King has brought dishonor onto the House of Representatives. We strongly urge you and the congressional leadership to demonstrate your revulsion with Rep. King&#x27;s actions by stripping him of his subcommittee chairmanship and initiating proceedings to formally censure or otherwise discipline him.&quot; Two leaders within the Iowa Jewish community also criticized King for being &quot;an enthusiastic crusader for the same types of abhorrent beliefs held by the Pittsburgh shooter&quot;.

==Post-political career==
After King&#x27;s loss in the 2020 Republican primary in Iowa&#x27;s 4th congressional district, he wrote a book giving his account of what happened and travelled for several months to promote it. The book is entitled &quot;Walking Through the Fire: My Fight for the Heart and Soul of America&quot;. It was put out by Fidelis Publishing, known for publishing Christian and conservative books. King says he was motivated to write lest &quot;the media and the elitists in the Republican Party write a political epitaph&quot; for him. The book maintains that freedom of speech is being undermined and that the Democratic Party is weaponizing terms like &quot;white nationalist&quot; and &quot;white supremacist&quot;. King claims his attempts to warn America about this was why he lost his party&#x27;s support, saying &quot;I&#x27;m trying to tell America, and what do they [Republican leadership] do? Politically assassinate me for trying to let them know what&#x27;s happening to all of us.&quot;

In 2021, he told the &quot;Des Moines Register&quot; that while he currently had no plans to return to politics, he would if there was a &quot;groundswell&quot;. He went on to say, &quot;I don&#x27;t see that at this point. But I do see a lot of support, and we&#x27;ve got a lot of policies and causes that we need to push. We&#x27;ve got state conventions coming up and a platform to be shaped.&quot;

King has campaigned against carbon-capture pipelines; at an August 2023 event cosponsored by the John Birch Society, he criticized the use of eminent domain and financial motivations behind the pipelines.

In December 2023, King campaigned with 2024 presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy at an event in Lakeside, Iowa, but stopped short of endorsing him. In January 2024, he gave a full endorsement of him.

<text>Hiram Gabriel Bithorn Sosa (March 18, 1916 – December 29, 1951) was a professional right-handed pitcher who became the first baseball player from Puerto Rico to play in Major League Baseball.

Standing and weighing about , Bithorn was a hard-throwing pitcher who commanded attention when he began his delivery with a distinctive windup, raising his long left leg high in the air and throwing a blazing fastball toward home plate.

==Early life==
Of mixed Danish-German-Scottish and Spanish descent, Bithorn was born as Hiram Gabriel Bithorn Sosa in Santurce, a heavily populated area in the city of San Juan, and was one of five children born to Waldemar G. Bithorn, a municipal employee, and María Sosa, a public school teacher. The Bithorn family traveled frequently to the United States. María taught her children English and at one time produced a radio program called &quot;Abuelita Borinqueña&quot; (Puerto Rican Grandmother). The young Hiram attended Central High School in Santurce, and his older two brothers, 11 and 10 years his senior, encouraged and assisted in training him to become an athlete.

In 1935, Bithorn competed in the III Central American and Caribbean Games held in San Salvador, El Salvador, helping his Puerto Rican teammates bring home a silver medal in volleyball and a bronze in basketball. By this time, he had already begun making a name for himself in baseball in 1932, while pitching on a team of &quot;nativos&quot; playing in the city of Guayama. The Puerto Ricans faced the Richmond BBC, a squad composed entirely of continental American players, including slugging first baseman and future Hall of Famer Johnny Mize, as the 16-year-old Bithorn led his team to a 10–1 victory over the visiting club.

==Baseball career==
Bithorn played winter ball for his home team Senadores de San Juan. When San Juan manager Juan Torruella resigned only two weeks into the 1938 season, the Senadores chose 22-year-old Bithorn as their new skipper, making him the youngest manager in Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League history. Within three years, Bithorn was pitching at Wrigley Field.

In 1939 Bithorn played in the US Minor Leagues, pitching for three seasons for the AA clubs Oakland Oaks and Hollywood Stars.

Bithorn was signed by the Chicago Cubs in September 1941 and debuted in the Major Leagues on April 15, 1942, making history as the first Puerto Rican to play in organized baseball. Bithorn won nine games and lost 14 in his first season, but he rebounded in 1943 by going 18–12 with an earned run average of 2.60 and completing 19 of his 30 starts, leading the league in shutouts with seven, establishing a record for Puerto Rican pitchers that still stands to this day. During this time, he also formed the second Latin American pitcher-catcher combination along with Cuban Chico Hernández.

On November 26, 1943, after his second season, Bithorn joined the United States Navy. While in the navy, he served at Naval Air Station San Juan in Puerto Rico where he became the player-manager for the baseball team at the station. He was discharged from the navy on September 1, 1945. His promising start did not last once he returned from military service. By this moment his weight had risen to 225 pounds, which led to rumors that he may not have the same abilities. Upon returning from the war, he returned to the Chicago Cubs, and went 6–5 in 1946. On January 25, 1947, he was purchased by the Pittsburgh Pirates only to be waived later. On March 22 of the same year, the Chicago White Sox selected him off waivers but only pitched two innings, developing a sore arm that ended his career.

In a four-season career, Bithorn posted a 34–31 record with a 3.16 ERA in 105 pitching appearances (53 as a starter), including 30 complete games, eight shutouts and five saves, striking out 185 batters while walking 171 in 509 innings of work.

==Later years==
At age 35, Bithorn tried to make a comeback in the Mexican Pacific League. He was shot by Mexican police officer Ambrosio Castillo Cano on December 28, 1951, in El Mante, Tamaulipas, Mexico. Bithorn then was transferred to Ciudad Victoria&#x27;s hospital, where he died the next day. Initially, Officer Castillo Cano claimed that Bithorn was violent and also admitted to being part of a communist cell, and that he was on an important mission. Eventually this argument was debunked in court and Castillo Cano was sentenced to eight years in prison for Bithorn&#x27;s murder. He was buried at Buxeda Cemetery in Carolina, Puerto Rico.

Bithorn&#x27;s achievement of making it to the majors remained a source of pride in Puerto Rico, and he was honored in 1962 when the biggest ballpark on the island was built and named after him. Hiram Bithorn Stadium is located next to Roberto Clemente Coliseum and across the street from Plaza Las Américas Mall, the stadium has also hosted world championship boxing fights, major professional wrestling events from the World Wrestling Council, the 1979 Pan American Games, and important musical spectacles. The Montreal Expos played 22 home games there in the 2003 and 2004 MLB seasons, while Rounds 1 and 2 of the 2006 and 2009 World Baseball Classic editions also were played there, including teams from Group C and Group D. In 2013 the World Baseball Classic Round 1, Pool C was played in the stadium, featuring Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Spain and Venezuela national teams.

<doc id="412942" wikidata="Q421804" url="?curid=412942" title="Lipopolysaccharide">
<text>Lipopolysaccharide, now more commonly known as endotoxin, is a collective term for components of the outermost membrane of the cell envelope of gram-negative bacteria, such as &quot;E. coli&quot; and &quot;Salmonella&quot; with a common structural architecture. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are large molecules consisting of three parts: an outer core polysaccharide termed the O-antigen, an inner core oligosaccharide and Lipid A (from which toxicity is largely derived), all covalently linked. In current terminology, the term endotoxin is often used synonymously with LPS, although there are a few endotoxins (in the original sense of toxins that are inside the bacterial cell that are released when the cell disintegrates) that are not related to LPS, such as the so-called delta endotoxin proteins produced by &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis&quot;.

Lipopolysaccharides can have substantial impacts on human health, primarily through interactions with the immune system. LPS is a potent activator of the immune system and is a pyrogen (agent that causes fever). In severe cases, LPS can trigger a brisk host response and multiple types of acute organ failure which can lead to septic shock. In lower levels and over a longer time period, there is evidence LPS may play an important and harmful role in autoimmunity, obesity, depression, and cellular senescence.

==Discovery==
The toxic activity of LPS was first discovered and termed &quot;endotoxin&quot; by Richard Friedrich Johannes Pfeiffer. He distinguished between exotoxins, toxins that are released by bacteria into the surrounding environment, and endotoxins, which are toxins &quot;within&quot; the bacterial cell and released only after destruction of the bacterial outer membrane. Subsequent work showed that release of LPS from Gram negative microbes does not necessarily require the destruction of the bacterial cell wall, but rather, LPS is secreted as part of the normal physiological activity of membrane vesicle trafficking in the form of bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), which may also contain other virulence factors and proteins.

== Functions in bacteria ==
LPS is a major component of the outer cell membrane of gram-negative bacteria, contributing greatly to the structural integrity of the bacteria and protecting the membrane from certain kinds of chemical attack. LPS is the most abundant antigen on the cell surface of most gram-negative bacteria, contributing up to 80% of the outer membrane of &quot;E. coli&quot; and &quot;Salmonella&quot;. LPS increases the negative charge of the cell membrane and helps stabilize the overall membrane structure. It is of crucial importance to many gram-negative bacteria, which die if the genes coding for it are mutated or removed. However, it appears that LPS is nonessential in at least some gram-negative bacteria, such as &quot;Neisseria meningitidis&quot;, &quot;Moraxella catarrhalis&quot;, and &quot;Acinetobacter baumannii&quot;. It has also been implicated in non-pathogenic aspects of bacterial ecology, including surface adhesion, bacteriophage sensitivity, and interactions with predators such as amoebae. LPS is also required for the functioning of omptins, a class of bacterial protease.

==Composition==
LPS are amphipathic and composed of three parts: the O antigen (or O polysaccharide) which is hydrophilic, the core oligosaccharide (also hydrophilic), and Lipid A, the hydrophobic domain.

=== O-antigen ===
The repetitive glycan polymer contained within an LPS is referred to as the O antigen, O polysaccharide, or O side-chain of the bacteria. The O antigen is attached to the core oligosaccharide, and comprises the outermost domain of the LPS molecule. The structure and composition of the O chain is highly variable from strain to strain, determining the serological specificity of the parent bacterial strain; there are over 160 different O antigen structures produced by different &quot;E. coli&quot; strains. The presence or absence of O chains determines whether the LPS is considered &quot;rough&quot; or &quot;smooth&quot;. Full-length O-chains would render the LPS smooth, whereas the absence or reduction of O-chains would make the LPS rough. Bacteria with rough LPS usually have more penetrable cell membranes to hydrophobic antibiotics, since a rough LPS is more hydrophobic. O antigen is exposed on the very outer surface of the bacterial cell, and, as a consequence, is a target for recognition by host antibodies.

===Core===

The core domain always contains an oligosaccharide component that attaches directly to lipid A and commonly contains sugars such as heptose and 3-Deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (also known as KDO, keto-deoxyoctulosonate). The core oligosaccharide is less variable in its structure and composition, a given core structure being common to large groups of bacteria. The LPS cores of many bacteria also contain non-carbohydrate components, such as phosphate, amino acids, and ethanolamine substituents.

===Lipid A===

Lipid A is, in normal circumstances, a phosphorylated glucosamine disaccharide decorated with multiple fatty acids. These hydrophobic fatty acid chains anchor the LPS into the bacterial membrane, and the rest of the LPS projects from the cell surface. The lipid A domain is the most bioactive and responsible for much of the toxicity of Gram-negative bacteria. When bacterial cells are lysed by the immune system, fragments of membrane containing lipid A may be released into the circulation, causing fever, diarrhea, and possible fatal endotoxic septic shock (a form of septic shock). The Lipid A moiety is a very conserved component of the LPS. However Lipid A structure varies among bacterial species. Lipid A structure largely defines the degree and nature of the overall host immune activation.

==Lipooligosaccharides==

The &quot;rough form&quot; of LPS has a lower molecular weight due to the absence of the O polysaccharide. In its place is a short oligosaccharide: this form is known as Lipooligosaccharide (LOS), and is a glycolipid found in the outer membrane of some types of Gram-negative bacteria, such as &quot;Neisseria&quot; spp. and &quot;Haemophilus&quot; spp. LOS plays a central role in maintaining the integrity and functionality of the outer membrane of the Gram negative cell envelope. LOS play an important role in the pathogenesis of certain bacterial infections because they are capable of acting as immunostimulators and immunomodulators. Furthermore, LOS molecules are responsible for the ability of some bacterial strains to display molecular mimicry and antigenic diversity, aiding in the evasion of host immune defenses and thus contributing to the virulence of these bacterial strains. In the case of &quot;Neisseria meningitidis&quot;, the lipid A portion of the molecule has a symmetrical structure and the inner core is composed of 3-deoxy-D-manno-2-octulosonic acid (KDO) and heptose (Hep) moieties. The outer core oligosaccharide chain varies depending on the bacterial strain.

==LPS detoxification ==
A highly conserved host enzyme called acyloxyacyl hydrolase (AOAH) may detoxify LPS when it enters, or is produced in, animal tissues. It may also convert LPS in the intestine into an LPS inhibitor. Neutrophils, macrophages and dendritic cells produce this lipase, which inactivates LPS by removing the two secondary acyl chains from lipid A to produce tetraacyl LPS. If mice are given LPS parenterally, those that lack AOAH develop high titers of non-specific antibodies, develop prolonged hepatomegaly, and experience prolonged endotoxin tolerance. LPS inactivation may be required for animals to restore homeostasis after parenteral LPS exposure. Although mice have many other mechanisms for inhibiting LPS signaling, none is able to prevent these changes in animals that lack AOAH.

Dephosphorylation of LPS by intestinal alkaline phosphatase can reduce the severity of &quot;Salmonella tryphimurium&quot; and &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; infection restoring normal gut microbiota. Alkaline phosphatase prevents intestinal inflammation (and
&quot;leaky gut&quot;) from bacteria by dephosphorylating the Lipid A portion of LPS.

==Biosynthesis and transport==


The entire process of making LPS starts with a molecule called lipid A-Kdo2, which is first created on the surface of the bacterial cell&#x27;s inner membrane. Then, additional sugars are added to this molecule on the inner membrane before it&#x27;s moved to the space between the inner and outer membranes (periplasmic space) with the help of a protein called MsbA. The O-antigen, another part of LPS, is made by special enzyme complexes on the inner membrane. It is then moved to the outer membrane through three different systems: one is Wzy-dependent, another relies on ABC transporters, and the third involves a synthase-dependent process.

Ultimately, LPS is transported to the outer membrane by a membrane-to-membrane bridge of lipolysaccharide transport (Lpt) proteins. This transporter is a potential antibiotic target.

==Biological effects on hosts infected with Gram-negative bacteria==

===LPS storage in the body===
The human body carries endogenous stores on LPS. The epithelial surfaces are colonized by a complex microbial flora (including gram-negative bacteria), which outnumber human cells by a factor of 10 to 1. Gram-negative bacterial will shed endotoxins. This host-microbial interaction is a symbiotic relationship which plays a critical role in systemic immunologic homeostasis. When this is disrupted, it can lead to disease such as endotoxemia and endotoxic septic shock.

===Immune response===
LPS acts as the prototypical endotoxin because it binds the CD14/TLR4/MD2 receptor complex in many cell types, but especially in monocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages and B cells, which promotes the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, nitric oxide, and eicosanoids. Bruce Beutler was awarded a portion of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work demonstrating that TLR4 is the LPS receptor.

As part of the cellular stress response, superoxide is one of the major reactive oxygen species induced by LPS in various cell types that express TLR (toll-like receptor). LPS is also an exogenous pyrogen (fever-inducing substance).

LPS function has been under experimental research for several years due to its role in activating many transcription factors. LPS also produces many types of mediators involved in septic shock. Of mammals, humans are much more sensitive to LPS than other primates, and other animals as well (e.g., mice). A dose of 1 μg/kg induces shock in humans, but mice will tolerate a dose up to a thousand times higher. This may relate to differences in the level of circulating natural antibodies between the two species. It may also be linked to multiple immune tactics against pathogens, and part of a multi-faceted anti-microbial strategy that has been informed by human behavioral changes over our species&#x27; evolution (e.g., meat eating, agricultural practices, and smoking). Said et al. showed that LPS causes an IL-10-dependent inhibition of CD4 T-cell expansion and function by up-regulating PD-1 levels on monocytes which leads to IL-10 production by monocytes after binding of PD-1 by PD-L1.

Endotoxins are in large part responsible for the dramatic clinical manifestations of infections with pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria, such as &quot;Neisseria meningitidis&quot;, the pathogens that causes meningococcal disease, including meningococcemia, Waterhouse–Friderichsen syndrome, and meningitis.

Portions of the LPS from several bacterial strains have been shown to be chemically similar to human host cell surface molecules; the ability of some bacteria to present molecules on their surface which are chemically identical or similar to the surface molecules of some types of host cells is termed molecular mimicry. For example, in &quot;Neisseria meningitidis&quot; L2,3,5,7,9, the terminal tetrasaccharide portion of the oligosaccharide (lacto-N-neotetraose) is the same tetrasaccharide as that found in paragloboside, a precursor for ABH glycolipid antigens found on human erythrocytes. In another example, the terminal trisaccharide portion (lactotriaose) of the oligosaccharide from pathogenic &quot;Neisseria&quot; spp. LOS is also found in lactoneoseries glycosphingolipids from human cells. Most meningococci from groups B and C, as well as gonococci, have been shown to have this trisaccharide as part of their LOS structure. The presence of these human cell surface &#x27;mimics&#x27; may, in addition to acting as a &#x27;camouflage&#x27; from the immune system, play a role in the abolishment of immune tolerance when infecting hosts with certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes, such as HLA-B35.

LPS can be sensed directly by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) through the bonding with TLR4, causing them to proliferate in reaction to a systemic infection. This response activate the TLR4-TRIF-ROS-p38 signaling within the HSCs and through a sustained TLR4 activation can cause a proliferative stress, leading to impair their competitive repopulating ability. Infection in mice using &quot;S. typhimurium&quot; showed similar results, validating the experimental model also &quot;in vivo&quot;.

===Effect of variability on immune response===
O-antigens (the outer carbohydrates) are the most variable portion of the LPS molecule, imparting antigenic specificity. In contrast, lipid A is the most conserved part. However, lipid A composition also may vary (e.g., in number and nature of acyl chains even within or between genera). Some of these variations may impart antagonistic properties to these LPS. For example, diphosphoryl lipid A of &quot;Rhodobacter sphaeroides&quot; (RsDPLA) is a potent antagonist of LPS in human cells, but is an agonist in hamster and equine cells.

It has been speculated that conical lipid A (e.g., from &quot;E. coli&quot;) is more agonistic, while less conical lipid A like that of &quot;Porphyromonas gingivalis&quot; may activate a different signal (TLR2 instead of TLR4), and completely cylindrical lipid A like that of &quot;Rhodobacter sphaeroides&quot; is antagonistic to TLRs. In general, LPS gene clusters are highly variable between different strains, subspecies, species of bacterial pathogens of plants and animals.

Normal human blood serum contains anti-LOS antibodies that are bactericidal and patients that have infections caused by serotypically distinct strains possess anti-LOS antibodies that differ in their specificity compared with normal serum. These differences in humoral immune response to different LOS types can be attributed to the structure of the LOS molecule, primarily within the structure of the oligosaccharide portion of the LOS molecule.
In &quot;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&quot; it has been demonstrated that the antigenicity of LOS molecules can change during an infection due to the ability of these bacteria to synthesize more than one type of LOS, a characteristic known as phase variation. Additionally, &quot;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&quot;, as well as &quot;Neisseria meningitidis&quot; and &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;, are capable of further modifying their LOS &quot;in vitro&quot;, for example through sialylation (modification with sialic acid residues), and as a result are able to increase their resistance to complement-mediated killing or even down-regulate complement activation or evade the effects of bactericidal antibodies. Sialylation may also contribute to hindered neutrophil attachment and phagocytosis by immune system cells as well as a reduced oxidative burst. &quot;Haemophilus somnus&quot;, a pathogen of cattle, has also been shown to display LOS phase variation, a characteristic which may help in the evasion of bovine host immune defenses.
Taken together, these observations suggest that variations in bacterial surface molecules such as LOS can help the pathogen evade both the humoral (antibody and complement-mediated) and the cell-mediated (killing by neutrophils, for example) host immune defenses.

===Non-canonical pathways of LPS recognition===
Recently, it was shown that in addition to TLR4 mediated pathways, certain members of the family of the transient receptor potential ion channels recognize LPS. LPS-mediated activation of TRPA1 was shown in mice and &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; flies. At higher concentrations, LPS activates other members of the sensory TRP channel family as well, such as TRPV1, TRPM3 and to some extent TRPM8. 
LPS is recognized by TRPV4 on epithelial cells. TRPV4 activation by LPS was necessary and sufficient to induce nitric oxide production with a bactericidal effect.

===Testing===

Lipopolysaccharide is a significant factor that makes bacteria harmful, and it helps categorize them into different groups based on their structure and function. This makes LPS a useful marker for telling apart various Gram-negative bacteria. Swiftly identifying and understanding the types of pathogens involved is crucial for promptly managing and treating infections. Since LPS is the main trigger for the immune response in our cells, it acts as an early signal of an acute infection. Therefore, LPS testing is more specific and meaningful than many other serological tests.

The current methods for testing LPS are quite sensitive, but many of them struggle to differentiate between different LPS groups. Additionally, the nature of LPS, which has both water-attracting and water-repelling properties (amphiphilic), makes it challenging to develop sensitive and user-friendly tests.

The typical detection methods rely on identifying the lipid A part of LPS because Lipid A is very similar among different bacterial species and serotypes. LPS testing techniques fall into six categories, and they often overlap: in vivo tests, in vitro tests, modified immunoassays, biological assays, and chemical assays.

===Endotoxin Activity Assay===

Because the LPS is very difficult to measure in whole blood and because most LPS is bound to proteins and complement, the Endotoxin Activity Assay (EAA™) was developed and cleared by the US FDA in 2003. EAA is a rapid in vitro chemiluminescent immunodiagnostic test. It utilizes a specific monoclonal antibody to measure the endotoxin activity in EDTA whole blood specimens. This assay uses the biological response of the neutrophils in a patient’s blood to an immunological complex of endotoxin and exogenous antibody – the chemiluminescent reaction formed creates an emission of light. The amount of chemiluminescence is proportional to the logarithmic concentration of LPS in the sample and is a measure of the endotoxin activity in the blood. The assay reacts specifically with the Lipid A moiety of LPS of Gram-negative bacteria and does not cross-react with cell wall constituents of Gram-positive bacteria and other microorganisms.

===Pathophysiology===

LPS is a powerful toxin that, when in the body, triggers inflammation by binding to cell receptors. Excessive LPS in the blood, endotoxemia, may cause a highly lethal form of sepsis known as endotoxic septic shock. This condition includes symptoms that fall along a continuum of pathophysiologic states, starting with a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and ending in multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) before death. Early symptoms include rapid heart rate, quick breathing, temperature changes, and blood clotting issues, resulting in blood vessels widening and reduced blood volume, leading to cellular dysfunction.

Recent research indicates that even small LPS exposure is associated with autoimmune diseases and allergies. High levels of LPS in the blood can lead to metabolic syndrome, increasing the risk of conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and liver problems.

LPS also plays a crucial role in symptoms caused by infections from harmful bacteria, including severe conditions like Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome, meningococcemia, and meningitis. Certain bacteria can adapt their LPS to cause long-lasting infections in the respiratory and digestive systems.

Recent studies have shown that LPS disrupts cell membrane lipids, affecting cholesterol and metabolism, potentially leading to high cholesterol, abnormal blood lipid levels, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. In some cases, LPS can interfere with toxin clearance, which may be linked to neurological issues.

==Health effects==
In general the health effects of LPS are due to its abilities as a potent activator and modulator of the immune system, especially its inducement of inflammation. LPS is directly cytoxic and is highly immunostimulatory – as host immune cells recognize LPS, complement are strongly activated. Complement activation and a rising anti-inflammatory response can lead to immune cell dysfunction, immunosuppression, widespread coagulopathy, and serious tissue damage, and can progress to multi-system organ failure and death.

===Endotoxemia===

The presence of endotoxins in the blood is called endotoxemia. High level of endotoxemia can lead to septic shock, or more specifically endotoxic septic shock, while lower concentration of endotoxins in the bloodstream is called metabolic endotoxemia. Endotoxemia is associated with obesity, diet, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes, while also host genetics might have an effect.

Moreover, endotoxemia of intestinal origin, especially, at the host-pathogen interface, is considered to be an important factor in the development of alcoholic hepatitis, which is likely to develop on the basis of the small bowel bacterial overgrowth syndrome and an increased intestinal permeability.

Lipid A may cause uncontrolled activation of mammalian immune systems with production of inflammatory mediators that may lead to endotoxic septic shock. This inflammatory reaction is primarily mediated by Toll-like receptor 4 which is responsible for immune system cell activation. Damage to the endothelial layer of blood vessels caused by these inflammatory mediators can lead to capillary leak syndrome, dilation of blood vessels and a decrease in cardiac function and can further worsen shock. LPS is also a potent activator of complemen. Uncontrolled complement activation may trigger destructive endothelial damage leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) with injury to various organs such as including kidneys and lungs. The skin can show the effects of vascular damage often coupled with depletion of coagulation factors in the form of petechiae, purpura and ecchymoses. The limbs can also be affected, sometimes with devastating consequences such as the development of gangrene, requiring subsequent amputation. Loss of function of the adrenal glands can cause adrenal insufficiency and additional hemorrhage into the adrenals causes Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome, both of which can be life-threatening.

It has also been reported that gonococcal LOS can cause damage to human fallopian tubes.

===Treatment of Endotoxemia===
Toraymyxin is a widely used extracorporeal endotoxin removal therapy through direct hemoadsorption (also referred to as hemoperfusion). It is a polystyrene-derived cartridge with molecules of polymyxin B (PMX-B) covalently bound to mesh fibers contained within it. Polymyxins are cyclic cationic polypeptide antibiotics derived from &quot;Bacillus polymyxa&quot; with an effective antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria, but their intravenous clinical use has been limited due to their nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity side effects. The extracorporeal use of the Toraymyxin cartridge allows PMX-B to bind lipid A with a very stable interaction with its hydrophobic residues thereby neutralizing endotoxins as the blood is filtered through the extracorporeal circuit inside the cartridge, thus reversing endotoxemia and avoiding its toxic systemic effects.

===Auto-immune disease===
The molecular mimicry of some LOS molecules is thought to cause autoimmune-based host responses, such as flareups of multiple sclerosis. Other examples of bacterial mimicry of host structures via LOS are found with the bacteria &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; and &quot;Campylobacter jejuni&quot;, organisms which cause gastrointestinal disease in humans, and &quot;Haemophilus ducreyi&quot; which causes chancroid. Certain &quot;C. jejuni&quot; LPS serotypes (attributed to certain tetra- and pentasaccharide moieties of the core oligosaccharide) have also been implicated with Guillain–Barré syndrome and a variant of Guillain–Barré called Miller-Fisher syndrome.

===Link to obesity===
Epidemiological studies have shown that increased endotoxin load, which can be a result of increased populations of endotoxin-producing bacteria in the intestinal tract, is associated with certain obesity-related patient groups. Other studies have shown that purified endotoxin from &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; can induce obesity and insulin-resistance when injected into germ-free mouse models. A more recent study has uncovered a potentially contributing role for &quot;Enterobacter cloacae&quot; B29 toward obesity and insulin resistance in a human patient. The presumed mechanism for the association of endotoxin with obesity is that endotoxin induces an inflammation-mediated pathway accounting for the observed obesity and insulin resistance. Bacterial genera associated with endotoxin-related obesity effects include &quot;Escherichia&quot; and &quot;Enterobacter.&quot;

=== Depression ===
There is experimental and observational evidence that LPS might play a role in depression. Administration of LPS in mice can lead to depressive symptoms, and there seem to be elevated levels of LPS in some people with depression. Inflammation may sometimes play a role in the development of depression, and LPS is pro-inflammatory.

===Cellular senescence===
Inflammation induced by LPS can induce cellular senescence, as has been shown for the lung epithelial cells and microglial cells (the latter leading to neurodegeneration).

==Role as contaminant in biotechnology and research ==

Lipopolysaccharides are frequent contaminants in plasmid DNA prepared from bacteria or proteins expressed from bacteria, and &quot;must&quot; be removed from the DNA or protein to avoid contaminating experiments and to avoid toxicity of products manufactured using industrial fermentation.

Ovalbumin is frequently contaminated with endotoxins. Ovalbumin is one of the extensively studied proteins in animal models and also an established model allergen for airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR). Commercially available ovalbumin that is contaminated with LPS can falsify research results, as it does not accurately reflect the effect of the protein antigen on animal physiology.

In pharmaceutical production, it is necessary to remove all traces of endotoxin from drug product containers, as even small amounts of endotoxin will cause illness in humans. A depyrogenation oven is used for this purpose. Temperatures in excess of 300 °C are required to fully break down LPS.

The standard assay for detecting presence of endotoxin is the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) assay, utilizing blood from the Horseshoe crab (&quot;Limulus polyphemus&quot;). Very low levels of LPS can cause coagulation of the limulus lysate due to a powerful amplification through an enzymatic cascade. However, due to the dwindling population of horseshoe crabs, and the fact that there are factors that interfere with the LAL assay, efforts have been made to develop alternative assays, with the most promising ones being ELISA tests using a recombinant version of a protein in the LAL assay, Factor C.

<doc id="412959" wikidata="Q701020" url="?curid=412959" title="Chiang Wei-kuo">
<text>Chiang Wei-kuo (; 6 October 1916 – 22 September 1997), also known as Wego Chiang, was the adopted son of Republic of China President Chiang Kai-shek, the adoptive brother of President Chiang Ching-kuo, a retired Army general, and an important figure in the Kuomintang. His courtesy names were Jian&#x27;gao () and Niantang (). Chiang served in the Wehrmacht before fighting in the Second Sino-Japanese War and Chinese Civil War.

==Early life==
As one of two sons of Chiang Kai-shek, Chiang Wei-kuo&#x27;s name has a particular meaning as intended by his father. &quot;Wei&quot; literally means &quot;parallel (of latitude)&quot; while &quot;kuo&quot; means &quot;nation&quot;; in his brother&#x27;s name, &quot;Ching&quot; literally means &quot;longitude&quot;. The names are inspired by the references in Chinese classics such as the &quot;Guoyu&quot;, in which &quot;to draw the longitudes and latitudes of the world&quot; is used as a metaphor for a person with great abilities, especially in managing a country.

Born in Tokyo when Chiang Kai-shek and the KMT were exiled to Japan by the Beiyang Government, Chiang Wei-kuo was the biological son of Tai Chi-tao and a Japanese woman, . Chiang Wei-kuo previously discredited any such claims and insisted he was a biological son of Chiang Kai-shek until his later years (1988), when he admitted that he was adopted.

According to reliable rumors, Tai believed knowledge of his Japanese tryst would destroy his marriage and his career, so he entrusted Wei-kuo to Chiang Kai-shek, after brought the infant to Shanghai. Yao Yecheng, a concubine of Chiang Kai-shek at the time, raised Wei-kuo as his foster mother. The boy called Tai his &quot;Dear Uncle&quot; ().

Chiang moved to the Chiang ancestral home in Xikou Town of Fenghua in 1920. Wei-kuo later studied physics at Soochow University.

==In the Wehrmacht==
His sibling, Chiang Ching-kuo, a student-turned-political-prisoner in Joseph Stalin&#x27;s Soviet Union, served as the impetus behind Chiang&#x27;s sending Wei-kuo to Nazi Germany for a military education at the Kriegsschule in Munich.

At the Kriegsschule, he studied the German army&#x27;s advanced methods, structure, and weaponry. He was specifically drawn by the then-theoretical machine gun company, which would use the &quot;Maschinengewehr&quot; (i.e., a medium machine gun) as the main weapon. The Maschinengewehr was the MG 34 then: a fast and reliable gun. The machine gun company would cooperate with air and armored units to assist the infantry&#x27;s attack. This would be called the &quot;Bewegungskrieg&quot; (&quot;War of Movement&quot;), and it would be very effective in the future World War II. After completing this training, Wei-kuo completed specialized training in Alpine warfare, thus earning him the coveted Gebirgsjäger Edelweiss sleeve insignia. Wei-kuo was promoted to Fahnenjunker (&quot;Officer Candidate&quot;), and received a Schützenschnur lanyard.

Wei-kuo commanded a Panzer unit during the 1938 Austrian Anschluss as a Fähnrich, or &quot;sergeant officer-candidate&quot;, leading a tank into that country. Subsequently, he was promoted to Lieutenant of a Panzer unit and awaited the Invasion of Poland. Before he was given the mobilization order, he was recalled to China to assist the war effort against the invading Japanese forces.

==Service during the Second Sino-Japanese War==

Upon being recalled from Germany, Chiang Wei-kuo visited the United States as a distinguished guest of the US Army on behalf of his father and the Kuomintang. While in the United States, he gave lectures detailing on German army organizations and tactics. During the war, Chiang Wei-kuo became acquainted with generals in Northwestern China and organized an armour mechanized battalion to formally take part in the National Revolutionary Army. Chiang Wei-kuo was stationed at a garrison in Xi&#x27;an in 1941. In addition, he spent some time at Fort Knox, Kentucky, studying tanks at the U.S. Army Armored School in 1940. Wei-kuo would become a Major at 28, a Lieutenant Colonel at 29, a Colonel at 32 whilst in charge of a tank battalion, and later in Taiwan, a Major General.

==Service during the Chinese Civil War==

During the Chinese Civil War, Chiang Wei-kuo employed tactics he had learned whilst studying in the German Wehrmacht. He was in charge of a tank battalion of the 1st Tank Regiment (equipped with Soviet T-26 light tanks and Italian CV-33/35 tankettes) during the Huaihai Campaign against Mao Zedong&#x27;s troops, scoring some early victories. While it was not enough to win the campaign, he was able to pull back without significant problems. Like many troops and refugees of the Kuomintang, he retreated from Shanghai to Taiwan and moved his tank regiment to Taiwan, becoming a divisional strength regiment commander of the armoured corps stationed outside of Taipei.

== Taiwan ==
Chiang Wei-kuo continued to hold senior positions in the Republic of China Armed Forces following the ROC retreat to Taiwan. In 1964, following the Hukou Incident and his subordinate Chao Chih-hwa&#x27;s attempted coup d&#x27;état, Chiang Wei-kuo was in the penalty box and never held any authority in the military.

From 1964 onwards, Chiang Wei-kuo made preparations in establishing a school dedicated to teaching warfare strategy; such a school was established in 1969. In 1975, Chiang Wei-kuo was further promoted to the position of general, and served as president of the Armed Forces University. In 1980, Chiang served as joint logistics commander in chief; then in 1986, he retired from the army and became National Security Council Secretary-General.

After Chiang Ching-kuo&#x27;s death, Chiang Wei-kuo was a political rival of native Taiwanese Lee Teng-hui, and he strongly opposed Lee&#x27;s Taiwan localization movement. Chiang ran as vice-president with Taiwan Governor Lin Yang-kang in the 1990 ROC indirect presidential election. Lee ran as the KMT presidential candidate and defeated the Lin-Chiang ticket.

==Personal life==
In 1944, he married Shih Chin-i (), the daughter of Shih Feng-hsiang (), a textile tycoon from North West China. Shih died in 1953 during childbirth. Wei-kuo later established the Chingshin Elementary School () in Taipei to commemorate his late wife.

In 1957, Chiang remarried, to Ellen Chiu Ju-hsüeh (), also known as Chiu Ai-lun (), a daughter of Chinese and German parents. Chiu gave birth to Chiang&#x27;s only son, Chiang Hsiao-kang, () in 1962. Chiang Hsiao-kang is the youngest of the Hsiao generation of the Chiang family.

Chiang Wei-kuo was also quite active in civil society, where he was the founder of the Chinese Institute of Strategy and Sino-German Cultural and Economic Association, as well as the Chairman of the Republic of China Football Association. He was the first chairman of Chingshin Primary School () and served as the president of the United States Students Association of China.

Chiang was a Freemason, and was the Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of China from 1968 to 1969.

== Final years ==
In the early 1990s, Chiang Wei-kuo established an unofficial Spirit Relocation Committee (奉安移靈小組) to petition the Communist government to allow his adopted father Chiang Kai-shek and brother Chiang Ching-kuo to be interred in mainland China. His request was largely ignored by both the Nationalist and Communist governments, and he was persuaded to abandon the petition by his father&#x27;s widow Soong Mei-ling in November 1996.

In 1991, Chiang&#x27;s housemaid, Li Hung-mei (, or ) was found dead in Chiang&#x27;s estate in Taipei City. The following police investigation discovered a stockpile of sixty guns on Chiang&#x27;s estate. Chiang himself admitted the possibility of a link between the guns and his maid&#x27;s death, which was later ruled a suicide by the police. The incident permanently tarnished Chiang Wei-kuo&#x27;s name, at a time when the Chiang family was increasingly unpopular on Taiwan and even within the Nationalist Party.

In 1993, Chiang Wei-kuo was employed as a senior advisor to President Lee Teng-hui despite their previous political rivalry.

In 1994, a hospital was supposed to be named after him () in Sanchih, Taipei County (now New Taipei City), after an unnamed politician donated to Ruentex Financial Group (潤泰企業集團), whose founder was from Sanchih. Politicians questioned the motivation.

In 1996, the Chiang home on military land was finally demolished by the order of the Taipei municipal government under Chen Shui-bian. The estate had been constructed in 1971. After Chiang moved elsewhere in 1981, he deeded it to his son. The justification was that his son was not in military service and thus was not entitled to live there.

Chiang Wei-kuo died at the age of 80, on 22 September 1997, from kidney failure. He had been experiencing falling blood pressure complicated by diabetes after a 10-month stay at Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei. He had wished to be buried in Suzhou on the mainland but was instead buried at Wuchih Mountain Military Cemetery.

<doc id="412960" wikidata="Q544795" url="?curid=412960" title="Ed Whitfield">
<text>Wayne Edward Whitfield (born May 25, 1943) is an American politician and attorney who served as the U.S. representative of from January 1995, until his resignation in September 2016. He is a member of the Republican Party, and the first to represent the district. His district covered much of the western part of the state, including Hopkinsville, Paducah, Henderson and Kentucky&#x27;s share of Fort Campbell.

==Early life, education and career==
Whitfield was born in Hopkinsville, Kentucky; his family later moved to Madisonville, Kentucky, where he graduated from Madisonville High School. He attended the University of Kentucky for both undergraduate and law school, where he was a member of Delta Tau Delta fraternity. He also attended the Wesley Theological Seminary. He served in the United States Army Reserve and reached the rank of First Lieutenant. He served as legal counsel to executives at Seaboard System Railroad of Washington. He served as a Vice President for the later CSX Corporation in two different capacities and was the Legal Counsel to the Chairman of the Interstate Commerce Commission from 1991 to 1993. this was a time when the Commission was deregulating the railroad and trucking industries. He was elected to the United States Congress in November 1994 and began his term in January, 1995, as a member of the 104th Congress. During his 21 plus years in the congress, Whitfield served on the Energy and Commerce Committee and served as Chairman of the Oversight and Investigation, Energy and Power Subcommittees.

==Kentucky House of Representatives==
Whitfield first became interested in politics as a high school student and attended his first political event at a rally for former United States Senator Dee Huddleston. As a student at the University of Kentucky, Whitfield was elected President of the University Young Democrat&#x27;s Club and in 1962 became involved in Edward T. Breathitt&#x27;s successful campaign for Governor of Kentucky. As a student, Whitfield worked in the State Treasurer&#x27;s office and after graduating from U.K. Law School he was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1973. He represented Hopkinsville and parts of Trigg County and was a member of the Democratic Party. After serving one term he decided not to seek re-election in 1975 or challenge freshman U.S. representative Carroll Hubbard in the 1976 primary. He focused on his family&#x27;s oil distributorship until he went to work with Seaboard System Railroad as legal counsel in 1979.

==U.S. Representative==

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Energy and Commerce
** Subcommittee on Energy and Power (Chairman)
** Subcommittee on Environment and Economy
** Subcommittee on Health

Whitfield was a member of the moderate Republican Main Street Partnership. On his official website, he represented himself as a conservative who has consistently voted anti-abortion and &quot;supports allowing students to engage in voluntary school prayer.&quot; He also lists military issues and encouraging the continued use of coal and nuclear as an anchor for baseload power to insure the use of an abundant, affordable and reliable source of electricity in the United States. The Sunlight Foundation reported in 2008 that among the 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives, Whitfield had the seventh-highest amount of investment in oil stocks. Whitfield was co-founder of the United States Turkish Caucus in the United States Congress. Recognizing the important role Turkey plays as the only Muslim Nation in NATO and having had many conversations with commanding generals of the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, Whitfield thought it was important to form a Congressional entity to provide support for Turkey in its role as a NATO Member.

He was one of three Republicans who voted for the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act in 2009.

When chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations within the Committee on Energy and Commerce, Whitfield held hearings on child pornography and during his tenure as Chairman of Energy and Power has chaired over 40 hearings on energy issues. He has focused significant time and resources to inform the American people about President Obama&#x27;s Clean Power Plan which was initiated by regulation through the EPA. President Obama and EPA did not consult or make any effort to work with Congress before issuing the Clean Power Plan to dictate the way electricity would be generated in the future. Chairman Whitfield referred to the Clean Power Plan as &quot;extreme&quot; and an &quot;unprecedented power grab&quot;. At one of his hearings, Professor Lawrence Tribe, who teaches constitutional law at Harvard University, said the Clean Power Plan if implemented would be like tearing up the Constitution of the United States. The Supreme Court, in considering a petition filed by 27 states opposed to the Clean Power Plan, issued an injunction to stop implementation of the plan. The DC Circuit Court of Appeals is currently preparing to hear oral arguments on the Clean Power Plan.

===Legislation sponsored===
Whitfield introduced the Electricity Security and Affordability Act (H.R. 3826; 113th Congress) into the House on January 9, 2014. The bill would repeal a pending rule published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on January 8, 2014. The proposed rule would establish uniform national limits on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from new electricity-generating facilities that use coal or natural gas. The rule also sets new standards of performance for those power plants, including the requirement to install carbon capture and sequestration technology. Whitfield said that, if finalized, the EPA&#x27;s rule would &quot;make it impossible to build a new coal-powered plant in American... That is hard to believe that that will can be the situation in our great country, particularly since 40 percent of our electricity comes from coal.&quot; Whitfield argued that the legislation was needed because the EPA refused to respond to criticism or complaints about their proposed rule. He also introduced and managed the floor debate on two Congressional Review Acts that had passed the United States Senate to stop the Clean Energy Plan Regulations adopted by EPA. He was successful in passing both measures on the House floor.

Whitfield&#x27;s major legislative accomplishments are creating the 170,000 acre of National Recreation Area at the Land between the Lakes. He also introduced and helped pass a health compensation program at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, which paid over $315,000,000 to the 3,139 employees and victims of toxic contamination. He also helped create the first Medicare Prescription Drug benefit plan for seniors.

Whitfield has introduced, sponsored and helped pass several bills to strengthen and insure the humane treatment of animals in the United States. He is a recognized leader regarding the humane treatment of animals. His major national accomplishment may have been the banning of U.S. horse slaughter for human consumption, with an amendment that barred the U.S. Department of Agriculture from spending money on inspections of horse slaughterhouses, which fed demand for horsemeat in some European and Asian countries. The ban is no longer in place, but it had the effect of killing the horse-slaughter industry in the U.S.

Whitfield&#x27;s legislation to prohibit the soring of Tennessee Walking Horses garnered the support of 311 House members and 57 Members of the United States Senate but was not brought to the floor of the House of Representatives because of an ethics complaint filed by individuals who sored horses . The individuals who filed the complaint had a total of 52 violations of the 1970 Horse Protection Act. In July 2016, the House Ethics Committee reproved him for failing to prohibit lobbying contacts between his staff and Connie Harriman Whitfield, a lobbyist for the Humane Society of the United States. The bill was introduced by Congressman Whitfield and had been a concern of his for many years; the Humane Society of the United States supported the legislation and was a part of a coalition of over 75 entities working to adopt it. The Ethics Committee issued a report stating that Whitfield&#x27;s breach was unintentional. Whitfield said the individuals who filed the complaint had accomplished their goal of stopping his legislation.

Whitfield was ranked as the 43rd most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives during the 114th United States Congress (and the most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Kentucky) in the Bipartisan Index created by The Lugar Center and the McCourt School of Public Policy that ranks members of the United States Congress by their degree of bipartisanship (by measuring the frequency each member&#x27;s bills attract co-sponsors from the opposite party and each member&#x27;s co-sponsorship of bills by members of the opposite party).

==Political campaigns==
Whitfield had been a Democrat for most of his life, but in 1994 filed to run in the 1st District as a Republican. He defeated the 1992 Republican nominee, Steve Hamrick, in the primary, and then defeated freshman Democratic Congressman Tom Barlow by 2,500 votes. He defeated Dennis Null in 1996 even as Bill Clinton carried the district, and never faced a close race afterwards. On September 29, 2015, Whitfield announced that he would not seek re-election in 2016. Critics said he did not seek re-election because of an ethics complaint filed against him by a group opposed to his legislation to stop the soring of Tennessee walking horses. That complaint was filed in 2013, and despite publicity throughout his district, Whitfield was re-elected overwhelmingly. He won every county in his district with the exception of Marion. On August 31, 2016, Whitfield announced that he would resign, effective September 6, prompting a special election that would allow his successor to serve in the lame duck session of Congress after the Nov. 8 election.

==Personal life==

Connie Whitfield is the Congressman&#x27;s second wife.

<text>Arthur Robert Kantrowitz (October 20, 1913 – November 29, 2008) was an American scientist, engineer, and educator.

Kantrowitz grew up in The Bronx and graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School. He earned his B.S., M.A. and, in 1947, his Ph.D. degrees in physics from Columbia University.

== Early life ==
Kantrowitz was born in New York City on October 28, 1913. His mother was a costume designer and his father ran a clinic in the Bronx. As a child, Arthur built an electrocardiograph from old radio parts, working with his brother Adrian (who would go on to perform the first heart transplant in the United States.)

==Career==
During his graduate studies at Columbia, Kantrowitz started working as a physicist in 1936 for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), work he would continue for ten years. While obtaining his Ph.D., Kantrowitz was supervised by Edward Teller. In 1938, he began construction of the Diffusion Inhibitor, the first known attempt to build a working fusion power reactor. The name was deliberately chosen to disguise its purpose, but it was eventually found out and the funding was cancelled.

He went on to teach at Cornell University for the next ten years and later founded the Avco-Everett Research Lab (AERL) in Everett, Massachusetts, in 1955. He developed shock tubes, which were able to produce the extremely hot gases needed to simulate atmospheric re-entry from orbital speeds, thereby solving the critical nose cone re-entry heating problem and accelerating the development of recoverable spacecraft. He was AERL&#x27;s director, chief executive officer, and chairman until 1978 when he took on a professorship at Dartmouth College. From 1956 to 1978 he also served as a vice president and director of Avco Corporation.

==Scientific contributions==
Kantrowitz&#x27;s interdisciplinary research in the area of fluid mechanics and gas dynamics led to contributions in the field of magnetohydrodynamics and to the development of high-efficiency, high-power lasers. He first suggested a system of laser propulsion to launch bulk payloads into orbit, using energy from ground-based lasers to increase exhaust velocity and thereby reduce the propellant-to-payload mass ratio. His concepts on laser propulsion were published in 1988.

His early research included supersonic diffusers and supersonic compressors in the early 40s, which has since been applied to jet engines. He invented the total energy variometer in 1939, used in soaring planes, and is the co-inventor of an early scheme for magnetically contained nuclear fusion, patent application, 1941. In 1950, he invented a technique for producing the supersonic source for molecular beams; this was subsequently used by chemists in research that led to two Nobel Prizes.

In the late 1950s, he returned to magnetic containment fusion, but abandoned that research in 1963, giving a paper saying he saw no way to address what he called &quot;second order instabilities&quot; that emerged in containment, leading to the tokamak sawtooth effect, an important negative result. This result stood for decades, though the ITER project has finally seen containment times measurable in minutes.

In the 1960s and 1970s, he led the design and development at AERL of the first intra-aortic balloon pump. The balloon pump is a temporary cardiac assist device which has been used worldwide on three million people. The device was used on his own failing heart.

Another contribution to science was the stagnation-point flow experiment in which processes of initial interaction of fresh flowing blood with an artificial surface can be directly visualized under a high-power microscope. This technique has become an important method for experimentally studying this vital interaction and led to a variety of circulatory prostheses, including the artificial heart.

Kantrowitz, as an advocate of the separation of science and technology from political or ideological concerns, first proposed in 1967 the creation of an Institution for Scientific Judgment, commonly referred to as the Science Court, to assess the state of knowledge in scientific controversies of importance to public policy. He further developed the Science Court as its Task Force Chairman in President Ford&#x27;s Advisory Group on Anticipated Advances in Science and Technology, 1975–1976.

According to Jerry Pournelle, &quot;We could have developed all this [i.e. large scale commercial space development] in the 60s and 70s, but we went another path. Arthur Kantrowitz tried to convince Kennedy&#x27;s people that the best way to the Moon was through development of manned space access, a von Braun manned space station, and on to the Moon in a logical way that left developed space assets.&quot;

===Kantrowitz limit===
Kantrowitz is known for development of a theoretical concept of fluid choke points at supersonic and near-supersonic inlet velocities. The concept has become known as the Kantrowitz limit.

====Technical description====
====Applications====
The Kantrowitz limit has many applications in the gas dynamics of inlet flow for jet engines and rockets, both when operating at high-subsonic and supersonic velocities.

Two examples will explain the effect of the Kantrowitz Limit on a nozzle. For both cases, Mass flow rate = Inlet Velocity multiplied by Area multiplied by Density.

Consider a nozzle connected to a vacuum source. As the pressure ratio gets to about 2, the flow through the nozzle will approach the local speed of sound, and the flow becomes choked flow. When the absolute pressure of the vacuum is decreased further, the flow speed will not increase. This is the Kantrowitz Limit, which limits the mass flow because the velocity is limited to the speed of sound, and the area, inlet pressure and density are all fixed. Aircraft jet engines are very much affected by this limit, once the inlet flow speed gets to Mach 1 the mass flow rate is limited, regardless of how much suction the engine creates.

Next, consider the nozzle connected to a compressed air supply. With a pressure ratio of about 2, the flow becomes choked, and cannot exceed the speed of sound. But the density and resultant mass flow rate can be increased by increasing the inlet pressure. The greater the pressure, the greater the density, and the greater the mass flow. So, while Kantrowitz limits the maximum gas velocity, it does not apply any fixed limit to the mass flow rate.

A recent high-speed transportation option for rapid transit between populous city-pairs about apart, the Hyperloop, has the Kantrowitz limit as a fundamental design criterion. Attempting to pass a high-speed passenger-pod through a very low pressure tube runs squarely into the Kantrowitz fluid flow limit. Historically, the solutions to working within the limit have been &quot;go fast&quot; and &quot;go slow&quot;. A major innovation in the Hyperloop proposal provides a novel third approach to remain below the Kantrowitz limit while still moving at high-subsonic velocities: adding a front-end inlet compressor to actively transfer high-pressure air from the front to the rear of the high-speed transport capsule, and thus bypassing much of the air that would have resulted in the dynamic shock of the choked flow. The flow in the smaller duct through the capsule is also subject to the Kantrowitz Limit, this is relieved by increasing the pressure and the density to achieve the required mass flow. In the Hyperloop alpha design of 2013, the air-inlet pump also provides a low-friction air-bearing suspension system for traveling at over .

==Honors and awards==
Kantrowitz was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, American Association for the Advancement of Science, American Astronautical Society, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (honorary), American Physical Society, American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering and member of the National Academy of Engineering and National Academy of Sciences and International Academy of Astronautics. In 1953–1954, he held both Fulbright and Guggenheim Fellowships at Cambridge and Manchester Universities.

Kantrowitz was an honorary trustee of the University of Rochester, an honorary life member of the Board of Governors of The Technion, and an honorary professor of the Huazhong Institute of Technology, Wuhan, China. Kantrowitz also served on the Board of Advisors for the Foresight Institute, an organization devoted to preparing for nanotechnology.

Kantrowitz held 21 patents and wrote or co-authored more than 200 scientific and professional papers and articles. He also co-authored &quot;Fundamentals of Gas Dynamics&quot;, 1958, Princeton Univ. Press.

Kantrowitz died at age 95, November 29, 2008, while visiting relatives in New York. He had suffered a heart attack on the previous day.

<doc id="412963" wikidata="Q546414" url="?curid=412963" title="Ron Lewis">
<text>Ronald Edward Lewis (born September 14, 1946) is an American retired politician who was a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from 1994 to 2009, having represented the 2nd congressional district of Kentucky.

Lewis announced on January 29, 2008, that he would not run for an eighth term.

==Early life, education, and career==
Lewis was born in McKell near South Shore in Greenup County in far northeastern Kentucky. He graduated in 1964 from McKell High School. He attended Morehead State University in Morehead in Rowan County from 1964 to 1967 and graduated from the University of Kentucky at Lexington in 1969 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history and political science. Lewis returned to Morehead in 1980 to earn a master&#x27;s degree in professional education in 1981.

At twenty-one, Lewis worked in the 1967 gubernatorial campaign of Louie B. Nunn of Glasgow. Nunn&#x27;s victory got Lewis a state job for a time and encouragement to run in 1971 for the Kentucky House of Representatives in his native Greenup County. Though he lost the legislative race in a Democratic year in Kentucky, Lewis maintained an interest in GOP politics. In 1972, Lewis served briefly in the U.S. Navy, attending the Navy Officer Candidate School in Pensacola, Florida; a kidney ailment resulted in a quick medical discharge.

Lewis worked in sales for several companies, including Ashland Oil, before teaching for five years at Watterson College in Louisville, Kentucky, having begun in 1980. (The school closed in the 1990s.) He also was ordained as a Southern Baptist minister in 1980, having served as pastor for the historic White Mills Baptist Church, after attending the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville. In 1985 Lewis opened a religious bookstore, Alpha and Omega Bookstore, in Elizabethtown. In the early 1980s, he was a pastor at Friendship Baptist Church, located outside Hodgenville.

Lewis has been married to Kayi Gambill Lewis since 1966. They live in Cecilia, near Elizabethtown, and have two children. He is a Southern Baptist.

==Congressional career==
===1994 election===
In 1994, Lewis filed to run against longtime Democratic Representative William H. Natcher in the general election in November 1994. The Second District was predominantly Democratic in terms of voter registration, and Natcher had held the seat without serious difficulty since 1953. Although Lewis had been personally endorsed by the state GOP leadership and Senator Mitch McConnell, he was considered somewhat of a &quot;sacrificial lamb&quot; candidate.

The dimensions of the race changed dramatically when Natcher died in late March 1994. A special election was called in May 1994 to replace him. In the special election, Lewis faced Joe Prather, a state senator from Hardin County. Lewis got support from numerous national Republican sources and many social conservative groups, enabling him to run a very strong campaign in a district that had not elected a Republican in 129 years. Lewis tied Prather to an unpopular Bill Clinton and a proposal to raise taxes on tobacco, the staple crop of the state. He also took advantage of the socially conservative tilt of the Second District.

In the special election Lewis defeated Prather by 55-45 percent in an election with less than 20 percent turnout—a result which is still considered a major upset. It was a result that many political pundits, as Larry J. Sabato noted in his Crystal Ball newsletter, saw as a harbinger of the Republican gains in Congress in the regular election later that year. Lewis was elected to a full term that November, when he defeated Democrat David Adkisson with 60 percent of the vote.

One of the centerpieces of Lewis&#x27; 1994 campaign was term limits in Washington. He was one of five Republicans who signed a pledge committing themselves to a limited number of terms if elected. He himself had promised to leave the House in 2003, after serving four full terms plus the last seven months of Natcher&#x27;s term. In 1998, Lewis sent a letter to 3,000 constituents in 1998 informing them he had changed his mind about running in 2002 and beyond. &quot;I made a mistake in 1994, and I admit that. I had said I would not run past 2002,&quot; he told the Elizabethtown News Enterprise in October 1998.

===Political positions===
According to the non-partisan website TheMiddleClass.org, Ron Lewis has consistently voted against tax increases and expansion of social programs.

In 2004, Lewis joined numerous Republican colleagues in sponsoring legislation that would allow lawmakers to override certain Supreme Court decisions by a two-thirds vote of the House and Senate. Lewis likened his proposal to the existing right of Congress to override a presidential veto with a two-thirds majority.

===1996–2004 campaigns===
Lewis won a second full term in 1996 with 58 percent of the vote by beating former Kentucky Senate floor leader Joe Wright with a vote total of 125,433 to 90,483. He did not face another serious challenge until 2006. In the 2004 election, he defeated Democrat Adam Smith, getting 68 percent of the vote.

===2006===
In the 2006 election, Lewis defeated retired U.S. Army Colonel Mike Weaver, a former member of the Kentucky House of Representatives. Weaver gave Lewis his first credible challenge in a decade, holding him to only 55 percent of the vote.

===Committee assignments===
*Ways and Means Committee
**Subcommittee on Social Security
**Subcommittee on Trade
*Republican Policy Committee

==Retirement==
On January 29, 2008, Lewis announced he would not seek reelection in 2008 on the same day as the filing deadline; he was hoping to ensure the GOP nomination would be won by his chief of staff, Daniel London, but State Senator Brett Guthrie also filed for the race. The decision shocked and angered many prominent Kentucky Republicans, Lewis said he was tired of splitting his time between Washington and Kentucky and that serving in Congress had not been as encouraging since Democrats gained the majority in 2007.

On the Democratic side, State Senator David Boswell of Daviess County and the Daviess County Judge-Executive Reid Haire both filed. Guthrie emerged the winner over primary rival Daniel London and then Boswell.

In 2010, Lewis announced his support for Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson in the race to fill the United States Senate seat of retiring Republican Senator Jim Bunning. Grayson lost the nomination to the eventual Senate winner, Republican Rand Paul.

Lewis deposited his congressional papers at Baptist-affiliated Campbellsville University.

<doc id="412971" wikidata="Q606809" url="?curid=412971" title="Eastern wood pewee">
<text>The eastern wood pewee (Contopus virens) is a small tyrant flycatcher from North America. This bird and the western wood pewee (&quot;C. sordidulus&quot;) were formerly considered a single species. The two species are virtually identical in appearance, and can be distinguished most easily by their calls.

==Taxonomy==
In 1760, the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the eastern wood pewee in his &quot;Ornithologie&quot; based on a specimen collected in the Carolinas. He used the French name &quot;Le gobe-mouche cendré de la Coroline&quot; and the Latin &quot;Muscicapa Carolinensis cinerea&quot;. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the eastern wood pewee. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Muscicapa virens&quot; and cited Brisson&#x27;s work. The specific name &quot;virens&quot; is Latin for &quot;green&quot;. This species is now placed in the genus &quot;Contopus&quot; that was introduced by the German ornithologist Jean Cabanis in 1855. The species is monotypic.

==Description==

The eastern wood pewee is in length and weighs around . Wingspan ranges 9.1–10.2 in (23–26 cm). The sexes are alike. The adult is gray-olive on the upperparts with light underparts, washed with olive on the breast. Each wing has two pale wing bars, and the primary remiges are long, giving the wingtip a slim and very pointed appearance. The upper part of the bill is dark, the lower part is yellowish. The songs are basically a mournful whistled &quot;pee-a&#x27;wee&quot; given in a series, which gave this bird its name, and a &quot;pe-wee&quot; with a rising note at the end.

=== Similar species ===
The western wood pewee (&quot;C. sordidulus&quot;) is essentially indistinguishable visually. But its range is parapatric to the west of the eastern wood pewee and its song—a descending &quot;tsee-tsee-tsee-peeer&quot;—is entirely different.

The eastern phoebe (&quot;Sayornis phoebe&quot;) is similar, particularly in the worn plumage after breeding. It always lacks clearly defined wingbars, however, and bobs its tail frequently. It has a shorter primary projection. The eastern phoebe is also present on the breeding grounds by March, while eastern wood pewees do not arrive until very late April and early May. The songs (&quot;fee-bee, fee-bee&quot;) and calls (&quot;chip&quot;) are quite different. The least flycatcher (&quot;Empidonax minimus&quot;) is quite similar to the eastern wood pewee in plumage, but has a bold eye ring and much shorter primary projection, appearing rather blunt-winged. It also has a shorter bill and is smaller overall. The songs (&quot;che-bec, che-bec&quot;) and calls (a sharp &quot;whit&quot;) are very different.

==Distribution and habitat==

Their breeding habitat is deciduous, mixed woods, or pine plantations in eastern North America. They migrate to Central America, the Caribbean, and in the Andes region of northern South America. They feed on insects and other arthropods. Wood pewees wait on a perch at a middle height in a tree and fly out to catch prey in flight, sometimes hovering to pick it from vegetation.

Eastern wood pewees arrive relatively late on breeding grounds (e.g., 18 May to 5 June in southern Ontario). They are rarely seen on their breeding grounds before the last days of April further south. They migrate south at a more usual time, leaving sometimes in late August but most often in September. Migration times have stayed the same in the last 100 years. They migrate quickly for most of the journey, dispersing and moving at a slower speed when approaching breeding or wintering range. For example, in the Cayman Islands which are offshore the winter quarters, the species is only rarely and briefly encountered, but passes through on its way north as early as mid-late February.

==Behaviour==
===Breeding===
The eastern wood pewee makes an open cup nest made of grasses, bark, and lichen, attached to a horizontal tree branch with spider webs. Nest sites range in height from , but average around . Common nest trees used include oaks (&quot;Quercus&quot;), pines (&quot;Pinus&quot;), birches (&quot;Betula&quot;), and maples (&quot;Acer&quot;). The female lays almost always three (sometimes two) translucent-white eggs with brown flecking concentrated towards the larger end of the ovate egg. Males are territorial and defend the nesting area aggressively, often fighting with neighbouring conspecifics and even pursue attacks on other species (e.g., least flycatchers, American robins, chipping sparrows, red-eyed vireos, etc.). Males can sometimes be polygynous, mating with two females, simultaneously.

The eggs hatch in 12–14 days and both parents bring food to the altricial nestlings. Nestlings typically fledge 15–17 days after hatching, often ending up on the ground during the first flight out of the nest. The adults will perch on a nearby branch and call out to the nestlings, keeping contact and providing them with food until the young are able to fly to join them.

==Conservation status==
The eastern wood pewee is common and widespread, and therefore not considered globally threatened by the IUCN. Its numbers, however, are declining in recent decades, possibly due to the loss of forest habitat in its winter range. It is also possible that the increase of white-tailed deer (&quot;Odocoileus virginianus&quot;) in its breeding range has led to a change in vegetation and associated invertebrates in the lower levels of the deciduous forests where the eastern wood pewee breeds.

<doc id="412973" wikidata="Q5467621" url="?curid=412973" title="Ford 385 engine">
<text>The Ford 385 engine family is a series of “big block&quot; overhead valve (OHV) V8 engines designed and manufactured by Ford Motor Company. The family derives its 385 name from the stroke of the 460 cubic-inch V8 introduced in 1968. A version was also introduced the same year, with a variant appearing in 1977.

Produced until 1998, the 385 engines replaced the MEL engine entirely, along with multiple engines of the medium-block FE engine family. The engines saw use by all three Ford divisions in full-size cars, intermediates, personal luxury cars, pony cars, and muscle cars. In trucks, the engine family succeeded the much larger Super Duty family, and was used in full-size trucks and vans, along with medium-duty and heavy-duty trucks.

Produced in Lima, Ohio at the Lima engine plant, the engine family was the final big-block V8 designed and produced by Ford during the 20th century. 
Last used in intermediate cars in 1976, the engines were phased out of all Ford cars after 1978 as its full-size cars underwent downsizing. Following its shift to truck use, the 385 engines were joined by multiple diesel-powered engines.

In 1997, Ford introduced the overhead-cam Triton V10, which replaced the 385 V8 engine family after the 1998 model year; the next overhead-valve big-block V8 produced by Ford is the 7.3 L &quot;Godzilla&quot; V8 introduced for 2020.

==Versions==
The engine was produced in 370 (6.1 L), 429 (7.0 L), and 460 cubic-inch (7.5 L) displacements. To reduce weight over their predecessors, the 385 engines utilized thinwall casting methods and a skirtless block.

===370===
The smallest-displacement engine of the 385 engine family, the 370 was introduced after the 429 and 460, replacing the 360 Truck (FT) V8 in 1977. Sharing its 3.59-inch stroke with the 429, the 370 was designed with a downsized 4.05-inch bore (shared with its predecessor and the 390 V8). For 1979, the engine was rebranded in metric, as 6.1 L.

After 1991 production, the 370 was discontinued, with the 429 replacing it in all truck applications.

Applications:
* Ford medium-duty F-Series (1977–1991)
** Ford F-600/F-700
** Ford B-Series (1977–1989)
* Ford C-Series (1979–1987)
** Ford C600–C800
* Ford L-Series &quot;Louisville Line&quot; (1977–1985)
** Ford L600–L800

===429===
The 429 was developed to replace the three largest FE-series V8s, the 390, 427, and 428. It shared its 4.36-inch bore with the 460, but was destroked to 3.59-inches.

The engine was introduced in the 1968 Ford Thunderbird, and saw use across Ford and Mercury full-size, intermediate, and pony car product lines. It was also available in high performance Cobra Jet versions for street use and police interceptors.

It was replaced in 1974 by the 460 in Ford and Lincoln-Mercury cars, and only available in medium-duty Ford trucks after the 1973 model year.

The engine became marketed in metric in 1979, as the 7.0L V8. Initially replacing the 401 Super Duty V8, the 7.0L replaced the 477 and 534 Super Duty engines for 1982. After 1991, the 429 became the sole gasoline engine offered in medium sized and larger Ford trucks; the 460/7.5L was only used in trucks under 1½-ton payload.

The 1971 429 police interceptor was tuned similarly to the 429 Cobra Jet, with an 11.3:1 compression ratio. Featuring forged notched pistons the engine was rated at 370 hp (gross).

Applications:
* Ford Thunderbird (1968–1973)
* Ford Mustang (1969–1971)
** Ford Mustang Boss 429 (1969–1970)
* Ford/Mercury full-size (1969–1973)
* Ford/Mercury intermediate: Torino, Montego, &amp; Cyclone (1969–1973)
* Mercury Cougar (1971)
* Ford medium-duty F-Series (1977–1998)
** Ford F-600/F-700/F-800
** Ford B-Series (1977–1989)
* Ford C-Series (1979–1987)
** Ford C600/C700/C800
* Ford L-Series &quot;Louisville Line&quot; (1977–1991)
** Ford L900

====Cobra Jet====
Ford developed two high-performance street versions of the 429 between 1969 and 1971, the Cobra Jet and Super Cobra Jet.

The Cobra Jet (429CJ) was fitted with a Rochester Quadrajet Spreadbore 4-bbl carburetor, a larger camshaft; a special set of cylinder heads (DOOE-R) 73.5 CC, combustion chamber and canted valve configuration, with pushrod guide plates (DIOE-6465-AA) Intakes valves were 2.24 and exhaust valves were 1.74, with non-adjustable hydraulic lifters. This allowed for an 11.3:1 compression ratio, increasing output to 370 hp. The engine was fitted with or without a hood scoop, matched with a 3.25:1 rear-axle ratio. When fitted with a &quot;shaker&quot; hood scoop, a 429 CJ-Ram Air equipped vehicle received a 3.50:1 rear axle. In 1971, the CJ engine also used a four-bolt main block DOVE-A.

* Applications:

====Super Cobra Jet====

The Super Cobra Jet (429SCJ) was fitted with a Holley Vac-Secondaries square-bore 4-bbl carburetor, larger mechanical camshaft, a four-bolt main block, forged pistons, single valve relief, forged rods, and Brinell tested cast iron crankshaft. The engine output was increased to 375 hp and 450 lb-ft of torque, matched with a 3.91:1 or 4.30:1 rear axle ratio.

* Applications:

===460===
The largest-displacement 385 engine, the 460 was developed as the successor for the 462 MEL V8 and the 390 FE/FT V8. It shared a 4.36-inch bore with the 429 but the 460 was designed with a 3.85-inch stroke. For 1968, it was introduced in the Continental Mark III and availability was exclusive to Lincolns until 1971. In 1972, the engine was introduced for the Mercury Marquis and Colony Park. For 1973, the 460 was added to Ford full-size cars, Ford and Mercury intermediates, and Ford F-Series trucks. In 1975, it later became available on Econoline vans.

From 1968 to 1971, the 460 was rated at 365 gross hp. In 1972 SAE net horsepower, which accounted for real world power losses created by engine accessories and the exhaust system, was adopted as a standard in North America, resulting in a significant decrease in horsepower ratings of all engines. In addition, a reduction in the 460 compression ratio (to 8.5:1) and modification of camshaft timing to allow the engine to comply with Federally mandated exhaust emissions standards, caused the rated output to plunge to ; output continued to change nearly annually thereafter to improve fuel economy and emissions performance in line with increasingly stringent Federal requirements, dropping as low as in 1977.

As Ford began to respond to the implementation of CAFE during the late 1970s, the 460 V8 (previously standard in Lincolns and full-size Mercury lines) became an option, with the 400 V8 (335-series) becoming the standard V8 engine; after 1976, the engine was removed from intermediate-sized cars entirely. Coinciding with their eventual downsizing, full-sized Ford and Lincoln-Mercury cars (including the Continental Mark V) last used the 460 for the 1978 model year.

From 1980 to 1982, the 460 was exclusive to the Econoline 350 van, as the 400 V8 became the largest engine for F-Series trucks. For 1983, the 460 returned to the F-Series, replacing the 400. For 1988, the 460 received fuel injection and power jumped to at 4100 rpm and at 2200 rpm. The 460, now marketed in metric as 7.5 L, continued mostly unchanged until 1994 when some minor ECU and compression ratio changes brought another 10 hp and 15 lb·ft, raising output to at 4100 rpm and at 2200 rpm for the last three years of production.

Through its fitment on chassis-cab versions of the F-Series and cutaway cab configurations of the E-Series, the 460 saw many applications of commercial use; other applications include recreational vehicles/RVs and bus use. As a crate engine, the 460 was produced by Ford Motorsports through 1997. After the 1997 model year, the 460 was replaced by the 6.8 L V10.

From 1973 to 1978, Ford offered two versions of the 460 police engine: a lower-output 210 hp 460 Police Cruiser, identified by engine code &quot;A&quot; in the installed vehicle&#x27;s vehicle identification number (VIN) and the engine&#x27;s valve cover spec sticker, and the higher-output 460 Police Interceptor, designated &quot;C&quot;. The cruiser came with a slightly modified passenger car 460 and was recommended for city and suburban use, while the more powerful, high speed modified 460 PI was built for highway patrol. 

* 460 &quot;A&quot;: a basic, street/production stock flowing engine with additional cooling bolt-ons and a block-mounted non-electric fuel pump. 
* 460 &quot;C&quot;: featured a higher lift camshaft and better flowing heads (D2OE-AB) or (D3OE-AA, AB) and exhaust system, along with a high flow, in-tank electric fuel pump, as the stock, block-mounted, cam-driven vacuum lift fuel pump would starve the motor for fuel above . The 460 Interceptor was capable of producing speeds in excess of when installed in certain vehicles.

Applications:
* Lincoln Continental (1968–1979)
* Ford Thunderbird (1972–1976)
* Mercury Cougar (1974–1976)
* Ford/Mercury full-size (1972–1978)
* Ford/Mercury intermediate (1973–1976)
* Ford F-Series (1973–1979)
* Ford F-Series (1983–1997) (F-250 HD, F-350, and F-Super Duty)
* Ford E-Series (1975–1996)

<text>Shimoga, officially Shivamogga, is a city and the district headquarters of Shimoga district in the Karnataka state of India. The city lies on the banks of the Tunga River. Being the gateway for the hilly region of the Western Ghats, the city is popularly nicknamed the &quot;Gateway of Malnad&quot;. The population of Shimoga city is 322,650 as per 2011 census. The city has been selected for the Smart Cities Mission, standing in the fourth position in the state and 25th in the country as of November 2020.

The city is 569 m above sea level and is surrounded by lush green paddy fields, arecanut and coconut groves. It is located 267 km from the state capital Bangalore and 195 km from the port city Mangalore.

==History==
The name of the city is derived from the term &quot;shivmoga&quot;. A version of the etymology is the story that Shiva drank the Tunga River hence the name &quot;Shiva-Mukha&quot; which means the &quot;face of Shiva&quot;. Another version of the etymology is that the name is derived from the term &quot;Sihi-Mogge&quot;, meaning &quot;sweet pot&quot;.

The district formed the southern tip of the Emperor Ashoka&#x27;s Mauryan Empire in the third century BC. It was ruled during later centuries by the Kadambas (4th century), Chalukyas (6th century), Western Ganga, Rashtrakutas (8th century), Hoysalas (11th century), and the Vijayanagara rulers (15th century). Nayakas of Keladi, also known as &quot;Nayakas of Bednore&quot; and &quot;Ikkeri Nayakas&quot;, were an Indian dynasty based in Keladi in present-day Shimoga district of Karnataka, India. They were an important ruling dynasty in late medieval and early modern Karnataka. They initially ruled as a vassal of the famous Vijayanagar Empire. After the fall of the empire in 1565, they gained independence and ruled significant parts of Malnad region of the Western Ghats in present-day Karnataka, most areas in the coastal regions of Karnataka, and parts of northern Kerala, Malabar and the central plains along the Tungabhadra river. In 1763 AD, with their defeat to Hyder Ali, they were absorbed into the Kingdom of Mysore.

<text>The western wood pewee (Contopus sordidulus) is a small tyrant flycatcher. Adults are gray-olive on the upperparts with light underparts, washed with olive on the breast. They have two wing bars and a dark bill with yellow at the base of the lower mandible. This bird is very similar in appearance to the eastern wood pewee; the two birds were formerly considered to be one species. The call of &quot;C. sordidulus&quot; is a loud buzzy &quot;peeer&quot;; the song consists of three rapid descending &quot;tsee&quot;s ending with a descending &quot;peeer&quot;.

== Description ==
Measurements:

* Length: 
* Weight: 
* Wingspan: 

==Habitat and ecology==

Their breeding habitat is open wooded areas in western North America. These birds migrate to South America at the end of summer. The female lays two or three eggs in an open cup nest on a horizontal tree branch or within a tree cavity; California black oak forests are examples of suitable nesting habitat for this species of bird. Both parents feed the young.

==Behavior==

They often wait on a perch at a middle height in a tree and fly out to catch insects in flight (hawking), and will also hover to pluck insects from vegetation (gleaning).

<text>Les Bulles (; Gaumais: &quot;Les Bûles&quot;) is a village of Wallonia and a district of the municipality of Chiny, located in Gaume in the province of Luxembourg, Belgium. 

The village is located in the valley of the Semois River at the angle with its affluent the Vierre River. The people who live in the village are called &quot;les Bulots&quot; or &quot;Les Bulaux&quot;.

Starting in 1340, Les Bulles was an independent seigniory. In 1673, The seigniory of Les Bulles has been annexed to the &#x27;baronnie&#x27; of Jamoigne.

==Origin of the name Les Bulles==
The strange name Les Bulles might have two possible origins : 
* From the French word &#x27;burn&#x27; (brûler). The term &quot;brûler&quot; refers to the big fire done during the carnival period.
* From the German word &#x27;bûr&#x27; (&#x27;burias&#x27; meaning residence).

Other origins of the name have been proposed without any real historical background. The final known orthograph of the name Les Bulles is used since 1340 following the writings. The name likely comes from &quot;bule&quot; or &quot;bure&quot;, which designates a large square or conical pile of branches, high enough to be burned. The name of Bules is seen in a Latin form, in a charter for the city of Orval in 1174. Later, in 1230 and 1271, Bures is also mentioned. Bures comes from the Latin meaning Burer burn. A bonfire celebration was also lit the annual day of bures, also called &quot;day of the brandons.&quot;

An odd feature of the name is that it does not contract after prepositions. One says &quot;aux Etats Unis&quot; or &quot;des Etats Unis&quot; but &quot;à Les Bulles&quot; &quot;club de football de Les Bulles&quot;.</text><links>

<doc id="412984" wikidata="Q876450" url="?curid=412984" title="Glide reflection">
<text>In geometry, a glide reflection or transflection is a geometric transformation that consists of a reflection across a hyperplane and a translation (&quot;glide&quot;) in a direction parallel to that hyperplane, combined into a single transformation. Because the distances between points are not changed under glide reflection, it is a motion or isometry. When the context is the two-dimensional Euclidean plane, the hyperplane of reflection is a straight line called the &quot;glide line&quot; or &quot;glide axis&quot;. When the context is three-dimensional space, the hyperplane of reflection is a plane called the &quot;glide plane&quot;. The displacement vector of the translation is called the &quot;glide vector&quot;.

When some geometrical object or configuration appears unchanged by a transformation, it is said to have symmetry, and the transformation is called a symmetry operation. &quot;Glide-reflection symmetry&quot; is seen in frieze groups (patterns which repeat in one dimension, often used in decorative borders), wallpaper groups (regular tessellations of the plane), and space groups (which describe e.g. crystal symmetries). Objects with glide-reflection symmetry are in general not symmetrical under reflection alone, but two applications of the same glide reflection result in a double translation, so objects with glide-reflection symmetry always also have a simple translational symmetry.

When a reflection is composed with a translation in a direction perpendicular to the hyperplane of reflection, the composition of the two transformations is a reflection in a parallel hyperplane. However, when a reflection is composed with a translation in any other direction, the composition of the two transformations is a glide reflection, which can be uniquely described as a reflection in a parallel hyperplane composed with a translation in a direction parallel to the hyperplane.

A single glide is represented as frieze group p11g. A glide reflection can be seen as a limiting rotoreflection, where the rotation becomes a translation. It can also be given a Schoenflies notation as S2∞, Coxeter notation as [∞+,2+], and orbifold notation as ∞×.

== Frieze groups ==

In the Euclidean plane, reflections and glide reflections are the only two kinds of indirect (orientation-reversing) isometries.

For example, there is an isometry consisting of the reflection on the &quot;x&quot;-axis, followed by translation of one unit parallel to it. In coordinates, it takes

This isometry maps the &quot;x&quot;-axis to itself; any other line which is parallel to the &quot;x&quot;-axis gets reflected in the &quot;x&quot;-axis, so this system of parallel lines is left invariant.

The isometry group generated by just a glide reflection is an infinite cyclic group.

Combining two equal glide reflections gives a pure translation with a translation vector that is twice that of the glide reflection, so the even powers of the glide reflection form a translation group.

In the case of glide-reflection symmetry, the symmetry group of an object contains a glide reflection, and hence the group generated by it. If that is all it contains, this type is frieze group p11g.

Example pattern with this symmetry group:
A typical example of glide reflection in everyday life would be the track of footprints left in the sand by a person walking on a beach.

Frieze group nr. 6 (glide-reflections, translations and rotations) is generated by a glide reflection and a rotation about a point on the line of reflection. It is isomorphic to a semi-direct product of Z and &quot;C&quot;2.

Example pattern with this symmetry group:
For any symmetry group containing some glide-reflection symmetry, the translation vector of any glide reflection is one half of an element of the translation group. If the translation vector of a glide reflection is itself an element of the translation group, then the corresponding glide-reflection symmetry reduces to a combination of reflection symmetry and translational symmetry.

== Wallpaper groups ==
Glide-reflection symmetry with respect to two parallel lines with the same translation implies that there is also translational symmetry in the direction perpendicular to these lines, with a translation distance which is twice the distance between glide reflection lines. This corresponds to wallpaper group pg; with additional symmetry it occurs also in pmg, pgg and p4g.

If there are also true reflection lines in the same direction then they are evenly spaced between the glide reflection lines. A glide reflection line parallel to a true reflection line already implies this situation. This corresponds to wallpaper group cm. The translational symmetry is given by oblique translation vectors from one point on a true reflection line to two points on the next, supporting a rhombus with the true reflection line as one of the diagonals. With additional symmetry it occurs also in cmm, p3m1, p31m, p4m and p6m.

In the Euclidean plane 3 of 17 wallpaper groups require glide reflection generators. p2gg has orthogonal glide reflections and 2-fold rotations. cm has parallel mirrors and glides, and pg has parallel glides. (Glide reflections are shown below as dashed lines)
== Space groups ==

Glide planes are noted in the Hermann–Mauguin notation by &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; or &quot;c&quot;, depending on which axis the glide is along. (The orientation of the plane is determined by the position of the symbol in the Hermann–Mauguin designation.) If the axis is not defined, then the glide plane may be noted by &quot;g&quot;. When the glide plane is parallel to the screen, these planes may be indicated by a bent arrow in which the arrowhead indicates the direction of the glide. When the glide plane is perpendicular to the screen, these planes can be represented either by dashed lines when the glide is parallel to the plane of the screen or dotted lines when the glide is perpendicular to the plane of the screen. Additionally, a centered lattice can cause a glide plane to exist in two directions at the same time. This type of glide plane may be indicated by a bent arrow with an arrowhead on both sides when the glide plan is parallel to the plane of the screen or a dashed and double-dotted line when the glide plane is perpendicular to the plane of the screen. There is also the &quot;n&quot; glide, which is a glide along the half of a diagonal of a face, and the &quot;d&quot; glide, which is along a fourth of either a face or space diagonal of the unit cell . The latter is often called the diamond glide plane as it features in the diamond structure. The &quot;n&quot; glide plane may be indicated by diagonal arrow when it is parallel to the plane of the screen or a dashed-dotted line when the glide plane is perpendicular to the plane of the screen. A &quot;d&quot; glide plane may be indicated by a diagonal half-arrow if the glide plane is parallel to the plane of the screen or a dashed-dotted line with arrows if the glide plane is perpendicular to the plane of the screen. If a &quot;d&quot; glide plane is present in a crystal system, then that crystal must have a centered lattice.

In today&#x27;s version of Hermann–Mauguin notation, the symbol &quot;e&quot; is used in cases where there are two possible ways of designating the glide direction because both are true. For example if a crystal has a base-centered Bravais lattice centered on the C face, then a glide of half a cell unit in the &quot;a&quot; direction gives the same result as a glide of half a cell unit in the &quot;b&quot; direction.

The isometry group generated by just a glide reflection is an infinite cyclic group. Combining two equal glide plane operations gives a pure translation with a translation vector that is twice that of the glide reflection, so the even powers of the glide reflection form a translation group.

In the case of glide-reflection symmetry, the symmetry group of an object contains a glide reflection and the group generated by it. For any symmetry group containing a glide reflection, the glide vector is one half of an element of the translation group. If the translation vector of a glide plane operation is itself an element of the translation group, then the corresponding glide plane symmetry reduces to a combination of reflection symmetry and translational symmetry.

== Examples and applications ==
Glide symmetry can be observed in nature among certain fossils of the Ediacara biota; the machaeridians; and certain palaeoscolecid worms. It can also be seen in many extant groups of sea pens.

In Conway&#x27;s Game of Life, a commonly occurring pattern called the glider is so named because it repeats its configuration of cells, shifted by a glide reflection, after two steps of the automaton. After four steps and two glide reflections, the pattern returns to its original orientation, shifted diagonally by one unit. Continuing in this way, it moves across the array of the game.
