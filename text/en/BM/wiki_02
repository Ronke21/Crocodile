<text>The Royal Naval Reserve (RNR) is one of the two volunteer reserve forces of the Royal Navy in the United Kingdom. Together with the Royal Marines Reserve, they form the Maritime Reserve. The present RNR was formed by merging the original Royal Naval Reserve, created in 1859, and the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR), created in 1903. The Royal Naval Reserve has seen action in World War I, World War II, the Iraq War and the War in Afghanistan.

==History==
=== Establishment ===
The Royal Naval Reserve (RNR) has its origins in the Register of Seamen, established in 1835 to identify men for naval service in the event of war, although just 400 volunteered for duty in the Crimean War in 1854 out of 250,000 on the Register. This led to a Royal Commission on Manning the Navy in 1858 and 1859, which in turn led to the Naval Reserve Act of 1859. This established the RNR as a reserve of professional seamen from the British Merchant Navy and fishing fleets, who could be called upon during times of war to serve in the regular Royal Navy. The RNR was originally a reserve of seamen only, but in 1863 was extended to include the recruitment and training of reserve officers. From its creation, RNR officers wore on their uniforms a unique and distinctive lace consisting of stripes of interwoven chain.
A number of drill-ships were established at the main seaports around the coasts of Great Britain and Ireland, and seamen left their vessels to undertake gunnery training in a drill-ship for one month every year. After initial shore training, officers embarked in larger ships of the Royal Navy&#x27;s fleet (usually battleships or battle cruisers) for one year, to familiarise themselves with gunnery and naval practice. Although under the operational authority of the Admiral Commanding, Reserves, the RNR was administered jointly by the Admiralty and the Registrar General of Shipping and Seamen at the Board of Trade throughout its separate existence. In 1910, the RNR (Trawler Section) was formed to recruit and train fishermen for wartime service in minesweepers and other small warships.

Officers and men of the RNR soon gained the respect of their naval counterparts with their professional skills in navigation and seamanship, and served with distinction in a number of conflicts including the Boer War and the Boxer Rebellion. Prior to the First World War many RNR officers transferred to the regular Royal Navy. In their professional careers, many RNR officers went on to command the largest passenger liners of the day and some also held senior positions in the shipping industry and the government.

=== Volunteer Reserve ===
At the turn of the 20th century, there were concerns at the Admiralty and in parliament that the RNR was insufficient to bolster the manning of the greatly-expanded fleet in the event of large-scale war. Despite the huge growth in the number of ships in the British merchant service since the RNR&#x27;s foundation, many of the additional seamen were from the colonies or were not British subjects. The pool of potential RNR officers had shrunk since 1859 and experience in the Boer War showed that it would not be possible to call up a sufficient number of reservists without negatively impacting the work of the merchant and fishing fleets. In 1903 an Act of Parliament was passed enabling the Admiralty to raise a second reserve force – the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. While the RNR consisted of professional civilian sailors, the RNVR was open to civilians with no prior sea experience. By the outbreak of the First World War there were six RNVR divisions in major ports around the UK.

=== First World War ===

On mobilisation in 1914, the RNR consisted of 30,000 officers and men. Officers of the permanent RNR on general service quickly took up seagoing appointments in the fleet, many in command, in destroyers, submarines, auxiliary cruisers and Q-ships. Others served in larger units of the battle fleet including a large number with the West Indies Squadron who became casualties at the Battle of Coronel and later at Jutland. Fishermen of the RNR section served with distinction on board trawlers fitted out as minesweepers for mine clearance operations at home and abroad throughout the war, where they suffered heavy casualties and losses. One such casualty was armed naval drifter HMT &quot;Frons Olivae&quot;, which hit a mine off Ramsgate on 12 October 1915 in an explosion that killed at least five other seamen. One casualty, a Newfoundlander serving with the Royal Naval Reserve, was subsequently buried in the Hamilton Road Cemetery, Deal, Kent.

A number of RNR officers qualified as pilots and flew aircraft and airships with the Royal Naval Air Service, whilst many RNR ratings served ashore with the RN and RNVR contingents at Gallipoli and at the Battle of the Somme with the Royal Naval Division. Merchant service officers and men serving in armed merchant cruisers, hospital ships, fleet auxiliaries and transports were entered in the RNR for the duration of the war on special agreements. Although considerably smaller than the RN and the RNVR (which was three times the size of the RNR at the end of the war), the RNR had an exceptional war record, members being awarded twelve Victoria Crosses.

=== Second World War ===
On commencement of hostilities in the Second World War, the RN once again called upon the experience and professionalism of the RNR to help it to shoulder the initial burden until sufficient manpower could be trained for the RNVR and &#x27;hostilities only&#x27; ratings. Again, RNR officers found themselves in command of destroyers, frigates, sloops, landing craft and submarines, or as specialist navigation officers in cruisers and aircraft carriers. In convoy work, the convoy commodore or escort commander was often an RNR officer. As in the First World War, the RNR acquitted itself well, winning four VCs.

An intermediate form of reserve, between the professional RNR and the civilian RNVR, had been created in 1936. This was the Royal Naval Volunteer (Supplementary) Reserve, open to civilians with existing and proven experience at sea as ratings or officers. In peacetime this carried no obligation or requirement for service or training, being merely a register of people who could be mobilised and trained swiftly in the event of war to quickly provide a core of new personnel. By September 1939 there were around 2,000 RNV(S)R members, mostly yachtsmen, who when mobilised were sent to active service after a 10-day training course while the RNVR began with a regular 12-week course for officers.

On the outbreak of the Second World War, no more ratings were accepted into the RNVR and new intake to the RNR stopped. The RNVR became the route by which virtually all new-entry commissioned officers joined the naval service during the war – the exception being professional mariners who already held master&#x27;s tickets, who would join the RNR. All new ratings would go direct to the regular Royal Navy. With the exception of the RNV(S)R and a proportion of recruits taken on as Direct Entrants (men with qualifications who would serve in specialist roles such as surgeons, engineers and those selected for intelligence duties), all the newly created temporary RNVR officers had initially been recruited as ratings and undertaken ten weeks of basic training. Recruits identified as having the potential to be officers at the end of this training were called Commission &amp; Warrant (CW) Candidates and then had to serve at least six months as Ordinary Seamen, including three months at sea. If still considered a CW candidate at the end of this period, they would become a Cadet Rating and proceed for officer training at . Those who did not meet and maintain the required standards while as CW Candidates or while training at &quot;King Alfred&quot; would continue to serve as RN ratings. Those who were successful would become Temporary Probationary Acting Sub-Lieutenants in the RNVR (those under the age of 21 became Midshipmen). After a month of satisfactory service they would no longer be Probationary and their ranks were confirmed (effectively a promotion from Acting to &#x27;full&#x27; Sub-Lieutenant) after three months. Men over the age of 25 who had earned a watchkeeping certificate were eligible for lieutenant rank after one year&#x27;s service.

By 1945 there were 43,805 officers in the RNVR, nicknamed the &quot;Wavy Navy&quot;, after the 3/8-inch wavy sleeve &#x27;rings&#x27; that officers wore to distinguish them from their RN and RNR counterparts. These new officers were primarily assigned to anti-submarine warfare/convoy escort, amphibious warfare and the Coastal Forces division - these being the areas of the naval service which saw the most growth during the Second World War, and which were most suitable for employing temporary officers who were quickly-trained in specific areas of expertise. In 1942 the Admiralty revised its arrangements for manning the fleet, reflecting the expansion of the service, the numbers of experienced career officers available and the generally good conduct and performance of the temporary officers taken into the RNVR. A Fleet Order of that year stated that &quot;the Fleet must be manned by Reserve officers with a leavening of Active Service officers, and not manned by RN Officers diluted with Reserve officers.&quot; This opened up new postings and promotion paths to temporary RNVR officers, including service on battleships, cruisers and aircraft carriers which had previously been largely the preserve of regular RN and experienced RNR officers. It also put temporary officers on a more equal footing with their regular counterparts when it came to being considered for executive and command positions.

=== Post-war ===

As intended, the thousands of RNVR officers employed during the Second World War on temporary commissions were quickly demobilised when the conflict ended. Of the more than 43,000 RNVR officers on the Navy List on VE Day, all but 600 had returned to civilian life by the time the RNVR was officially reconstituted in its original peacetime form in October 1946, now with 12 Divisions across the UK. The post-war RNVR was permitted its own independent sea-going capability - something which had not been the case before the war - with Divisions being given charge of surplus Motor Launches and Motor Minesweepers, which were commissioned, given new names and used for training duties as well as supporting larger RN units. 

In 1951 King George VI issued a royal announcement that the RNR and RNVR were to lose their distinctive insignia. Both reserves would now use the same style as the regular RN - officers would wear the straight stripes of lace but with an &#x27;R&#x27; in the executive curl while ratings would be distinguished by &#x27;RNR&#x27; and &#x27;RNVR&#x27; cap tallies or shoulder flashes as required. 

In 1954 the RNVR&#x27;s role in the British armed forces for the Cold War era was confirmed - Divisions would be equipped with Ton-class minesweepers which would collectively become the 101st Minesweeper Squadron. This was part of the RN&#x27;s permanent established strength and would consist of a rotating number of RNVR minesweepers, each fulfilling a period of active duty for its parent Division and giving the men of that Division their required regular time on active service at sea. The 101st Minesweeper Squadron was declared as part of Britain&#x27;s standing naval commitment to NATO. While only a small portion of the total RNVR was on active service with the 101st Squadron at any one time, it was envisaged that in time of war the RNVR as a whole would become Britain&#x27;s primary coastal minesweeping force, allowing the use of regular RN ships and men for other duties. The unit became the 10th Minesweeping Squadron in 1962. The Squadron regularly conducted two large-scale training exercises each year, one to Gibraltar and one to North Africa. The Squadron also made a number of overseas deployments, including four ships deployed on operations to British Guiana and the West Indies in 1965. The Ton-class minesweepers were replaced by new River-class ships in the mid-1980s, with all but one of the 12-strong class being assigned to RNR divisions. 

From 1938 until 1957, the RNVR provided aircrew personnel in the form of their own Air Branch. In 1947, their contribution was cut to anti-submarine and fighter squadrons only. By 1957, it was considered by the UK government that the training required to operate modern equipment was beyond that expected of reservists and the Air Branch squadrons were disbanded. (The US government took a different view, and the US Navy and Marine reserve squadrons today still operate front-line types alongside the regular units.) The Air Branch was reformed at RNAS Yeovilton in 1980, though it is only open to service leavers.

In 1958 it was decided to amalgamate the RNR and RNVR into a single reserve service. Legally the RNR was the branch that continued, so that no new legislation had to be drafted to allow the service to function and all RNVR personnel received formal papers transferring them to the RNR. The new unified reserve took the name and legal identity of the original RNR but primarily retained the character and structure of the RNVR, being composed mostly of trained civilians not from sea-going professions. The service continues to adapt to conflicts; the AW Branch was formed following the Falklands War in 1982, when over 100 reservists volunteered for special temporary duties during, primarily serving in communications, intelligence, staff headquarters and medical roles. But in the analysis of the conflict it was decided that a reserve of personnel with experience of handling large merchant ships and trained in joint operations should be maintained, with serving Merchant Navy officers as the main focus. The Falklands War also led to the formation of the Public Affairs Branch (now Media Operations), providing a body of trained specialists to manage the relationship between the Navy and the media in times of crisis - this followed several unfortunate public relations errors during the War. 

Defence reviews over the last 50 years have been inconsistent. Successive reviews have seen reserve forces cut then enlarged, allocated new roles, then cuts withdrawn, then re-imposed. Options for Change in 1990 reduced the RNR by 1,200 and closed many training centres, including HMS &quot;Calpe&quot; (Gibraltar), (Southampton) and HMS &quot;Graham&quot; (Glasgow). By 1995 the RNR&#x27;s total strength was 2600 - 800 officers and 1800 ratings. The Strategic Defence Review in 1998 continued this by disbanding the 10th Minesweeping Squadron, meaning that the RNR no longer had its own ships and sea-going capability. In return the RNR was to gain 350 members in total strength. The restructured RNR was designed to &quot;provide an expanded pool of personnel to provide additional reinforcements for the Fleet&quot;, mainly in the roles of logistics and communications - specialist support roles the need for which would expand significantly in the event of a major deployment or extended conflict but which it was not seen as viable to maintain within the regular RN&#x27;s peacetime strength. 

This left the mine-warfare, seaman and diving specialists in &quot;limbo&quot; until the Iraq War (second Gulf War), when the Royal Navy realised it had a pool of reservists with no real sea post. Echoing the Royal Naval Division in the First World War, the Above Water Force Protection branch was formed &quot;from RN reservists with no draft appointment at the outbreak of war&quot;. Because of a lack of full-time personnel, mine-warfare returned (in part) to the RNR. Officers and ratings serve on active service in Full Time Reserve Service billets throughout the RN, as well as in mobilised posts in Afghanistan, the Middle East, the Balkans and the UK. The centenary of the formation of the RNVR was commemorated by the RNR in London in 2003 with a parade on Horse Guards, at which Prince Charles took the salute. The Merchant Navy officers within today&#x27;s RNR commemorated RNR 150 in 2009.

In 2002 the RNR ceased to be issued its own identity cards, with reservists being issued the same documents as their regular counterparts. In 2007 the last distinctions in insignia between regular and reserve services were eliminated - officers no longer wore the &#x27;R&#x27; in the curl of their rank stripes and ratings wore &#x27;Royal Navy&#x27; shoulder flashes. The exception is for those holding honorary officer positions in the RNR, who continue to wear uniforms with the &#x27;R&#x27; in the executive curl. 

Commodore RNR Melanie Robinson was appointed the first female Commodore Maritime Reserves (COMMARES) on 4 February 2020.

In October 2022 a new RNR unit, , was commissioned as a specialist unit administering the RNR Air Branch, based at RNAS Yeovilton (HMS &quot;Heron&quot;) and with a satellite office at RNAS Culdrose (HMS &quot;Seahawk&quot;). This was the first naval unit to be commissioned during the reign of King Charles III.

===Branding controversy===

Since the Royal Navy rebrand in 2003 that cost circa £100,000, the Royal Naval Reserve has been without its own logo; when one is required, the Royal Navy logo is used with the word Reserves added below, and there is no logo for the entire Maritime Reserve. The older Royal Naval Reserve logo is still used as the watermark for passing out certificates issued to Royal Naval Reserve ratings at .

==Trades and specialisations==

All RNR personnel, regardless of rank, enrol as general service before being later assigned to a branch of service. RNR Officers join as a General Duty Reserve, and specialise after commissioning and passing their Fleet Board while RNR Ratings join as General Entry and specialise after basic training.

Most branches are open to both ratings and officers with the exception of fleet protection (ratings only) and a small number which recruit exclusively from the officer ranks. Listed below is an overview of branches, each of which contains further sub-specialisations. 

===New Entry Branch===

== URNU and Sea Cadet Corps ==

=== University Royal Naval Unit (URNU) ===

The University Royal Naval Units, although under the jurisdiction of BRNC Dartmouth, are also an honorary part of the Royal Naval Reserve. Students hold the rank of officer cadet (OC), and can be promoted to honorary midshipman on completion of their second year. URNU OCs can now undergo the Accelerated Officer Programme (AOP) to become substantive RNR Midshipmen. They can then either continue on an RNR Unit or be seconded back to their URNU for the duration of their university studies. Training Officers attached to URNUs are appointed as temporary officers in the RNR, without commission or call-up liability, who wear the &#x27;R&#x27; in their executive curl.

=== Sea Cadet Corps (SCC) ===

As nominal members of the RNR (SCC RNR), officers of the Sea Cadet Corps and the RN CCF Combined Cadet Force retain the use of the former RNVR &#x27;wavy navy&#x27; lace. However, unlike their traditional RNVR counterparts, they are civilians, do not come under General Trained Strength and are not liable to be called up or deploy.

Officers receive a Cadet Forces commission, introduced in 2017 and restated in 2018; previously they were appointed within their respective Corps, rather than commissioned (unless they already held a commission separately). They are titled ‘(SCC) RNR’ or ‘(CCF) RNR’ to differentiate from the deployable Royal Naval Reserve.

==Units==
The modern RNR has sixteen Royal Naval Reserve Units (with three satellite units). These are:
* (Rosyth)
** Tay Division (Dundee)
* (Cardiff)
** Tawe Division (Swansea)
* (Glasgow)
* (Bristol)
* (Gateshead)
* (Leeds)
* (London)
** Medway Division (Chatham)
* (Liverpool)
* (Devonport)
* (Nottingham)
* (Portsmouth)
* (Birmingham)
* (Lisburn)
* (Northwood)
* (Chicksands)
* (Yeovilton)

Previous units that closed due to recommendations in Options for Change:
* HMS &quot;Pellew&quot; (Exeter)
* HMS &quot;Wildfire&quot; (Chatham)
* HMS &quot;Salford&quot; (Manchester)
* HMS &quot;Dragon&quot; (Swansea)

<text>Hepatitis E is inflammation of the liver caused by infection with the hepatitis E virus (HEV); it is a type of viral hepatitis. Hepatitis E has mainly a fecal-oral transmission route that is similar to hepatitis A, although the viruses are unrelated. HEV is a positive-sense, single-stranded, nonenveloped, RNA icosahedral virus and one of five known human hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E.

Like hepatitis A, hepatitis E usually follows an acute and self-limiting course of illness (the condition is temporary and the individual recovers) with low death rates in resource-rich areas; however, it can be more severe in pregnant women and people with a weakened immune system, with substantially higher death rates. In pregnant women, especially in the third trimester, the disease is more often severe and is associated with a clinical syndrome called fulminant liver failure, with death rates around 20%. Whereas pregnant women may have a rapid and severe course, organ transplant recipients who receive medications to weaken the immune system and prevent organ rejection can develop a slower and more persistent form called chronic hepatitis E, which is so diagnosed after 3 months of continuous viremia. HEV can be clustered genetically into 8 genotypes, and genotypes 3 and 4 tend to be the ones that cause chronic hepatitis in the immunosuppressed.

In 2017, hepatitis E was estimated to affect more than 19 million people. Those most commonly at risk of HEV are men aged 15 to 35 years of age. A preventive vaccine (HEV 239) is approved for use in China.

The virus was discovered in 1983 by researchers investigating an outbreak of unexplained hepatitis among Soviet soldiers serving in Afghanistan. The earliest well-documented epidemic of hepatitis E occurred in 1955 in New Delhi and affected tens of thousands of people (hepatitis E virus was identified as the etiological agent at fault retrospectively through testing of stored samples).
==Signs and symptoms==

===Acute infection===
The average incubation period of hepatitis E is 40 days, ranging from 2 to 8 weeks. After a short prodromal phase symptoms may include jaundice, fatigue, and nausea, though most HEV infections are asymptomatic. The symptomatic phase coincides with elevated hepatic aminotransferase levels. Viral RNA becomes detectable in stool and blood serum during the incubation period. Serum IgM and IgG antibodies against HEV appear just before the onset of clinical symptoms. Recovery leads to virus clearance from the blood, while the virus may persist in stool for much longer. Recovery is also marked by disappearance of IgM antibodies and increase of levels of IgG antibodies.

===Chronic infection===
While usually lasting weeks and then resolving, in people with weakened immune systems—particularly in people who have had solid organ transplant—hepatitis E may cause a chronic infection. Occasionally this may result in a life-threatening illness such as fulminant liver failure or liver cirrhosis.

===Other organs===
Infection with hepatitis E virus can also lead to problems in other organs. For some of these reported conditions such as musculoskeletal or immune-mediated manifestations the relationship is not entirely clear, but for several neurological and blood conditions the relationship appears more consistent:
* Acute pancreatitis (HEV genotype 1)
* Neurological complications (though the mechanism of neurological damage is unknown at this point.) include: Guillain-Barré syndrome (acute limb weakness due to nerve involvement), neuralgic amyotrophy (arm and shoulder weakness, also known as Parsonage-Turner syndrome), acute transverse myelitis and acute meningoencephalitis.
* Glomerulonephritis with nephrotic syndrome and/or cryoglobulinemia
* Mixed cryoglobulinemia, where antibodies in the bloodstream react inappropriately at low temperatures
* Severe thrombocytopenia (low platelet count in the blood) which confers an increased risk of dangerous bleeding

=== Infection in pregnancy ===
Pregnant women show a more severe course of infection than other populations. Liver failure with mortality rates of 20% to 25% has been reported from outbreaks of genotype 1 and 2 HEV in developing countries. Besides signs of an acute infections, adverse effects on the mother and fetus may include preterm delivery, abortion, stillbirth, and neonatal death.

The pathological and biological mechanisms behind the adverse outcomes of pregnancy infections remain largely unclear. Increased viral replication and influence of hormonal changes on the immune system are currently thought to contribute to worsening the course of infection. Furthermore, studies showing evidence for viral replication in the placenta or reporting the full viral life cycle in placental-derived cells in vitro suggest that the human placenta may be a site of viral replication outside the liver. The primary reason for HEV severity in pregnancy remains enigmatic.

==Virology==

===Classification===
HEV is classified into the family &quot;Hepeviridae&quot;, which is divided in two genera, &quot;Orthohepevirus&quot; (all mammalian and avian HEV isolates) and &quot;Piscihepevirus&quot; (cutthroat trout HEV). Only one serotype of the human virus is known, and classification is based on the nucleotide sequences of the genome. Genotype 1 can be further subclassified into five subtypes, genotype 2 into two subtypes, and genotypes 3 and 4 have been divided into 10 and seven subtypes. Additionally there are genotypes 5, 6, 7 and 8. Rat HEV was first isolated from Norway rats in Germany, and a 2018 CDC article indicated the detection of rat HEV RNA in a transplant recipient.

====Distribution====
* Genotype 1 has been isolated from tropical and several subtropical countries in Asia and Africa.
* Genotype 2 has been isolated from Mexico, Nigeria, and Chad.
* Genotype 3 has been isolated almost worldwide including Asia, Europe, Oceania, and North and South America.
* Genotype 4 appears to be limited to Asia and indigenous cases from Europe.

Genotypes 1 and 2 are restricted to humans and often associated with large outbreaks and epidemics in developing countries with poor sanitation conditions. Genotypes 3 and 4 infect humans, pigs, and other animal species and have been responsible for sporadic cases of hepatitis E in both developing and industrialized countries.

===Transmission===

Hepatitis E (genotype 1 and, to a lesser extent genotype 2) is endemic and can cause outbreaks in Southeast Asia, northern and central Africa, India, and Central America. It is spread mainly by the fecal–oral route due to contamination of water supplies or food; direct person-to-person transmission is uncommon. In contrast to genotypes 1 and 2, genotypes 3 and 4 cause sporadic cases thought to be contracted zoonotically, from direct contact with animals or indirectly from contaminated water or undercooked meat.

Outbreaks of epidemic hepatitis E most commonly occur after heavy rainfalls, especially monsoons because of their disruption of water supplies; heavy flooding can causes sewage to contaminate water supplies. The World Health Organization recommendation for chlorine on HEV inactivation, a free chlorine residual of for 30 min (pH, &lt;8.0) Major outbreaks have occurred in New Delhi, India (30,000 cases in 1955–1956), Burma (20,000 cases in 1976–1977), Kashmir, India (52,000 cases in 1978), Kanpur, India (79,000 cases in 1991), and China (100,000 cases between 1986 and 1988). According to Rein et al., HEV genotypes 1 and 2 caused some 20.1 million hepatitis E infections, along with 3.4 million cases of symptomatic disease, and 70,000 deaths in 2005; however the aforementioned paper did not estimate the burden of genotypes 3 and 4.

According to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, evidence indicated the increase in hepatitis E in the U.K. was due to food-borne zoonoses, citing a study that found in the U.K. that 10% of pork sausages contained the hepatitis E virus. Some research suggests that food must reach a temperature of for 20 minutes to eliminate the risk of infection. The Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency discovered hepatitis E in almost half of all pigs in Scotland.

Hepatitis E infection appeared to be more common in people on hemodialysis, although the specific risk factors for transmission are not clear.

===Animal reservoir===
Hepatitis E due to genotypes other than 1 and 2 is thought to be a zoonosis, in that animals are thought to be the primary reservoir; deer and swine have frequently been implicated. Domestic animals have been reported as a reservoir for the hepatitis E virus, with some surveys showing infection rates exceeding 95% among domestic pigs.
Replicative virus has been found in the small intestine, lymph nodes, colon, and liver of experimentally infected pigs. Transmission after consumption of wild boar meat and uncooked deer meat has been reported as well. The rate of transmission to humans by this route and the public health importance of this are, however, still unclear. Other animal reservoirs are possible but unknown at this time

A number of other small mammals have been identified as potential reservoirs: the lesser bandicoot rat (&quot;Bandicota bengalensis&quot;), the black rat (&quot;Rattus rattus brunneusculus&quot;) and the Asian house shrew (&quot;Suncus murinus&quot;). A new virus designated rat hepatitis E virus has been isolated.

===Genomics===

HEV has three open reading frames (ORFs) encoding two polyproteins (O1 and O2 protein). ORF2 encodes three capsid proteins whereas O1 encodes seven fragments involved in viral replication, among others.

The smallest ORF of the HEV genome, ORF3 is translated from a subgenomic RNA into O3, a protein of 113–115 amino acids. ORF3 is proposed to play critical roles in immune evasion by HEV. Previous studies showed that ORF3 is bound to viral particles found in patient sera and produced in cell culture. Although in cultured cells ORF3 has not appeared essential for HEV RNA replication, viral assembly, or infection, it is required for particle release.

=== Virus lifecycle ===
The lifecycle of hepatitis E virus is unknown; the capsid protein obtains viral entry by binding to a cellular receptor. ORF2 (c-terminal) moderates viral entry by binding to HSC70.

Geldanamycin blocks the transport of HEV239 capsid protein, but not the binding/entry of the truncated capsid protein, which indicates that Hsp90 plays an important part in HEV transport.

==Diagnosis==
In terms of the diagnosis of hepatitis E, only a laboratory blood test that confirms the presence of HEV RNA or IgM antibodies to HEV can be trusted. In the United States no serologic tests for diagnosis of HEV infection have ever been authorized by the Food and Drug Administration. The World Health Organization has developed an international standard strain for detection and quantification of HEV RNA. In acute infection the viremic window for detection of HEV RNA closes 3 weeks after symptoms begin.

===Virological markers===
Assuming that vaccination has not occurred, tests may show:
* if the person&#x27;s &quot;immune system is normal&quot;, then
** if IgM anti-HEV is negative, then there is no evidence of recent HEV infection
** if IgM anti-HEV is positive, then the person is likely to have a recent or current HEV infection
* if the person&#x27;s &quot;immune system is weakened by disease or medical treatment&quot;, as in the case of a person who has received a solid organ transplant, then
** if IgM anti-HEV is negative, then if additional blood testing reveals
*** positive HEV RNA then the person has HEV infection
*** negative HEV RNA then there is no evidence of current or recent infection
** if IgM anti-HEV is positive, then the person is likely to have a recent or current HEV infection, and HEV RNA may be useful to track resolution

==Prevention==

===Sanitation===
Sanitation is the most important measure in prevention of hepatitis E; this consists of proper treatment and disposal of human waste, higher standards for public water supplies, improved personal hygiene procedures, and sanitary food preparation. Thus, prevention strategies of this disease are similar to those of many other diseases that plague developing nations. Cooking meat at for five minutes kills the hepatitis E virus, different temperatures means different time to inactivate the virus.

===Blood products===
The amount of virus present in blood products required to cause transfusion-transmitted infection (TTI) appears variable. Transfusion transmission of hepatitis E virus can be screened via minipool HEV NAT (Nucleic acid testing) screening. NAT is a technique used to screen blood molecularly, when blood donations are received; it screens for TTI.

===Vaccines===
A vaccine based on recombinant viral proteins was developed in the 1990s and tested in a high-risk population (in Nepal) in 2001. The vaccine appeared to be effective and safe, but development was stopped for lack of profitability, since hepatitis E is rare in developed countries. No hepatitis E vaccine is licensed for use in the United States.

The exception is China; after more than a year of scrutiny and inspection by China&#x27;s State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA), a hepatitis E vaccine developed by Chinese scientists was available at the end of 2012. The vaccine—called HEV 239 by its developer Xiamen Innovax Biotech—was approved for prevention of hepatitis E in 2012 by the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology, following a controlled trial on 100,000+ people from Jiangsu Province where none of those vaccinated became infected during a 12-month period, compared to 15 in the group given placebo. The first vaccine batches came out of Innovax&#x27;s factory in late October 2012, to be sold to Chinese distributors.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1038/491021a&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to lack of evidence, the World Health Organization has not made a recommendation regarding routine use of the HEV 239 vaccine as of 2015. Its 2015 position was that national authorities may decide to use the vaccine based on their local epidemiology.

==Treatment==
There is no drug that has established safety and effectiveness for hepatitis E, and there have been no large randomized clinical trials of antiviral drugs. Reviews of existing small studies suggest that ribavirin can be considered effective in immunocompromised people who have developed chronic infection.

Chronic HEV infection is associated with immunosuppressive therapies, and when that happens in individuals with solid-organ transplantation, reducing immunosuppressive medications can result in clearance of HEV in one third of patients.

==Epidemiology==
The hepatitis E virus causes around 20 million infections a year. These result in around three million acute illnesses and resulted in 44,000 deaths during 2015. Pregnant women are particularly at risk of complications due to HEV infection, who can develop an acute form of the disease that is fatal in 30% of cases or more. HEV is a major cause of illness and of death in the developing world and disproportionate cause of deaths among pregnant women. Hepatitis E is endemic in Central Asia, while Central America and the Middle East have reported outbreaks. Increasingly, hepatitis E is being seen in developed nations, with reports in 2015 of 848 cases of hepatitis E virus infection in England and Wales.

===Recent outbreaks===

In October 2007, an epidemic of hepatitis E occurred in Kitgum District of northern Uganda. This outbreak progressed to become one of the largest known hepatitis E outbreaks in the world. By June 2009, it had resulted in illness in 10,196 persons and 160 deaths. The aforementioned outbreak occurred despite no previous epidemics having been documented in the country, women were the most affected by HEV.

In July 2012, an outbreak was reported in South Sudanese refugee camps in Maban County near the Sudan border. South Sudan&#x27;s Ministry of Health reported over 400 cases and 16 fatalities as of 13 September 2012. Progressing further, as of 2 February 2013, 88 died due to the outbreak. The medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres said it treated almost 4000 people. In April 2014, an outbreak in the Biratnagar Municipality of Nepal resulted in infection of over 6000 locals and at least 9 dead.

During an outbreak in Namibia, the number of affected people rose from 490 in January 2018, to 5014 (with 42 deaths) by April 2019, to 6151 cases (with 56 deaths) by August 2019; the WHO estimated that the case fatality rate was 0.9%.

In Hong Kong in May 2020, there were at least 10 cases of hepatitis E that were transmitted by rats, and possibly hundreds of cases that had a transmission mechanism that is not fully understood.

2024 outbreak in Finland. A record number of hepatitis E cases have been diagnosed in Finland so far this year, according to figures released on Tuesday by public health authority THL. Data from the authority&#x27;s Infectious Diseases Register showed that a total of 92 lab-confirmed infections have been recorded since the beginning of January until 12 March, with 42 people requiring hospital treatment. The outbreak has been suspected to be caused by a batch of mettwurst that has been recalled.

== Evolution ==
The strains of HEV that exist today may have arisen from a shared ancestor virus 536 to 1344 years ago.
Another analysis has dated the origin of Hepatitis E to ~6000 years ago, with a suggestion that this was associated with domestication of pigs. At some point, two clades may have diverged — an anthropotropic form and an enzootic form — which subsequently evolved into genotypes 1 and 2 and genotypes 3 and 4, respectively.

Whereas genotype 2 remains less commonly detected than other genotypes, genetic evolutionary analyses suggest that genotypes 1, 3, and 4 have spread substantially during the past 100 years.

<doc id="411019" wikidata="Q2547874" url="?curid=411019" title="Bicycle Playing Cards">
<text>Bicycle Playing Cards is a brand of playing cards. Since 1885, the Bicycle brand has been manufactured by the United States Printing Company, which, in 1954, became the United States Playing Card Company (USPCC), now based in Erlanger, Kentucky. &quot;Bicycle&quot; is a trademark of that company.

The name Bicycle was chosen to reflect the popularity of the bicycle at the end of the 19th century.

==Design==
Bicycle cards follow the pattern of the French deck, containing 52 cards (13 in each of two red and two black suits), and include two jokers. The Bicycle trademark is printed on the ace of spades. Current decks contain two advertisement cards as well.

Bicycle playing cards are sold in a variety of designs, the most popular being the Rider Back design (No.63). They are available with standard indexes in poker size (), bridge size (), and pinochle decks, &quot;Jumbo Index&quot; poker decks and Lo Vision cards that are designed for the visually impaired. Other types of cards with varying backs, sizes, colors and custom designs are produced for magic tricks and as novelty and collectors&#x27; items.

===Numbered back designs===
Many different back designs have been produced by USPCC and sold under the Bicycle brand.

==Significance in American wars==
=== World War I ===

Toward the end of the World War I, the United States Playing Card Company produced four &quot;War Series&quot; decks under the Bicycle brand to represent each of the branches of the U.S. armed services: Flying Ace for the Aviation Section of the Signal Corps, Dreadnaught for the Navy, Invincible (aka Conqueror) for the Marine Corps, and Big Gun for the Army. The decks were printed in 1917, and apparently only given an extremely limited release before being withdrawn from circulation. It is unknown why the decks were not circulated, but one theory is that they were intended to be distributed to the troops overseas, and USPCC destroyed their inventory of the War Decks when Armistice was declared in 1918. Only a handful of these decks exist today.

=== World War II ===
During World War II, cards were produced that could be peeled apart when submerged in water. Portions of a large map could be drawn on the inside surfaces, and the halves were then reassembled to form an innocuous-looking deck. These cards were supplied to POWs for use in escapes. At least one example of such a deck is known to exist, and is on display at the International Spy Museum in Washington, DC. Modern reproductions have been sold in limited editions.

=== Vietnam War ===
The company provided crates of ace of spades cards for U.S. soldiers in the Vietnam War. It was erroneously believed that the Viet Cong regarded this particular card as a symbol of death and would flee at the sight of it. In actuality, it initially meant nothing to the Viet Cong, but the belief that the enemy was afraid of the cards improved the U.S. soldiers&#x27; morale. The origin of the cards is attributed to a letter written by a Lt. Charles W. Brown in early 1966 to Allison F. Stanley, the President of the United States Playing Card Company. Brown had read remarks from Congressman Craig Hosmer of California that the Viet Cong held superstitions of bad luck with pictures of women and the ace of spades. The Bicycle design of this card featured an image of the Goddess of Liberty combined with the spade.

Upon conferring with other lieutenants, Brown asked for 1,000 aces of spades for his company to leave for the enemy to find, as an indication that American troops had been in the area. Stanley was sympathetic to the soldiers and pulled cards from the production line to send free of charge. The story was reported by several news outlets, including the &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot;; as a result, more units began to request cards.

The symbol was eventually included in the official psychological warfare operations, and thousands of special decks containing only aces of spades were donated by the card company to soldiers that purposely scattered them throughout the jungle and villages during raids.

Similar cards were produced during the Gulf War in 1991, immediately prior to the invasion of Iraq by US forces. Due to the short duration of the conflict, these cards never saw battle.

<text>The Straits Times (also known informally by its abbreviation ST) is a Singaporean daily English-language newspaper owned by the SPH Media Trust. Established on 15 July 1845, it is the most-widely circulated newspaper in the country and has a significant regional audience. The newspaper is published in the broadsheet format and online, the latter of which was launched in 1994. It is regarded as the newspaper of record for Singapore.

Print and digital editions of &quot;The Straits Times&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; had a daily average circulation of 364,134 and 364,849 respectively in 2017, as audited by Audit Bureau of Circulations Singapore. In 2014, country-specific editions were published for residents in Brunei and Myanmar, with newsprint circulations of 2,500 and 5,000 respectively.

==History==

===Early years===
The original conception for &quot;The Straits Times&quot; has been debated by historians of Singapore. Prior to 1845, the only English-language newspaper in Singapore was &quot;The&quot; &quot;Singapore Free Press&quot;, founded by William Napier in 1835. Marterus Thaddeus Apcar, an Armenian merchant, had intended to start a paper, hired an editor, and purchased printing equipment from England. However the would-be editor died abruptly, prior to the arrival of the printing equipment, and Apcar went bankrupt. Fellow Armenian and friend, Catchick Moses, then bought the printing equipment from Apcar and launched &quot;The Straits Times&quot; with Robert Carr Woods, Sr., an English journalist from Bombay as editor. The paper was founded as The Straits Times and Singapore Journal of Commerce on 15 July 1845. 

&quot;The Straits Times&quot; was launched as an eight-page weekly, published at 7 Commercial Square using a hand-operated press. The subscription fee then was Sp.$1.75 per month. As editor, Woods sought to distinguish &quot;The Straits Times&quot; from &quot;The Singapore Free Press&quot; by including humour, short stories, and foreign news, and by making use of regular steamship services carrying mail that launched shortly before &quot;The Straits Times&quot; was launched. Historian Mary Turnbull disputes this account of &quot;The Straits Times&quot;&#x27; founding, saying that it was unlikely an Armenian merchant would have wanted to found an English-language newspaper, particularly given the presence of the more established &quot;Singapore Free Press&quot;. In September 1846, the paper was given to Woods outright because the press proved unprofitable to run and Moses was unable to sell it. The paper struggled with a lack of subscribers and newsworthy items to coverage. Woods covered the financial deficit by using the printing press for other projects, including the first directory of Singapore, &quot;The Straits Times Almanack, Calendar and Directory&quot;, published in 1846. 

The first major political stance taken by &quot;The Straits Times&quot; was against James Brooke, the Rajah of Sarawak. Woods personally resented Brooke and changed that Brooke&#x27;s action against Dayak &quot;pirates&quot; was a massacre of peaceful, civilian merchants. The rival &quot;Singapore Free Press&quot; came to Brooke&#x27;s defence and the ensuing controversy boosted the circulation of both papers. Woods petitioned the British government for an inquest of Brooke&#x27;s actions in 1851, with a commission convened in 1854. Brookes was exonerated, but the popularity of the episode made &quot;The Straits Times&quot; a success, and it became a daily newspaper in 1858.

Woods continued as editor of the paper until he sold it in 1860. John Cameron served as editor from 1861 to 1869, during which the paper nearly went out of business due to a hugely destructive fire. The paper&#x27;s assets were sold at public auction for $40 and Cameron went bankrupt, although he managed to revive the newspaper. Six years after Cameron&#x27;s death in 1881, his widow appointed Arnot Reid, a young Scottish journalist, as editor, who then held the post for 12 years. 

&quot;The Straits Times&quot; became a major reporter of political and economic events of note in British Malaya, including shipping news, civil and political unrest in Siam and Burma, official reports, and including high society news items such as tea parties held at Government House and visits from dignitaries such as the Sultan of Johor. Colonial officials, such as Frank Swettenham, wrote articles, sometimes in their own names. The paper later published Swettenham&#x27;s writings on the history of Perak and his involvement in the British Residential system in 1893. 

Following Reid&#x27;s retirement, Alexander W. Still took over as editor, a post he held for 18 years. During Still&#x27;s leadership as editor, &quot;The Straits Times&quot; built a reputation for bold reporting and fearless commentary. It was known as the &quot;Thunderer of the East&quot;, a reference to the original Thunderer, &quot;The Times of London&quot;, and was a critic of the British colonial administration, though much milder in its criticism of the government compared to its critique of unethical businesses. Under Still&#x27;s leadership, circulation (from 3,600 in 1910 to 4,100 in 1920) and ad revenues increased. Still&#x27;s outspokenness as editor resulted in a number of libel suits against the paper, which were either lost or settled privately out of court. He believed that the paper had an obligation to investigate and expose corruption both in government and in business. For our own part, we cherish the liberty of the press simply for its value to the community as a whole. Nothing fills us with greater contempt than the type of journalism, unfortunately somewhat on the increase in Great Britain, which pries into private affairs, gloats over domestic scandals, and tickles the palates of the people with snappy tidbits of personality. We do not want liberty of the press extended in a form that would enable this kind of journalism to pander without fear of penalties. But in the modern constitution of society, the press has great functions to perform. It is the chief safeguard against corruption . . . our business is to do what we deem right and necessary in the public interest, and no law court can be the keeper of our conscience . . . Malaya has some reason to be proud of its press. It is honest, clean, and public-spirited. It may be wrong-headed occasionally - we may ourselves be the chief of sinners in that respect - but it puts no man or woman to the blush, and its aims are generally wholesome.Still attacked the actions of governor Laurence Guillemard on the grounds of a free press, such as back-room discussions of a proposed constitutional change that colonial administrators urged reporters to delay covering until the proposals were announced. In an editorial, Still replied, &quot;That is mere pompous nonsense when addressed to a free people and a free press.&quot;

The &quot;Singapore Free Press&quot;, which had folded in 1869, was revived by W.G. St. Clair, who edited it until 1916. The rival newspapers spurred readership among the growing English-reading community, with &quot;The Singapore Free Press&quot; published in the morning and &quot;The Straits Times&quot; released in the afternoon. Still retired from &quot;The Straits Times&quot; in 1926 and the paper cycled through four editors in the span of two years before George Seabridge became editor in 1928. He held the position for the next 18 years and oversaw huge growth in circulation: from 5,000 to 25,000 subscribers. 

&quot;The Straits Times&quot; focused predominantly on British and British-related events while ignoring the politics and socio-economic issues of concern to other groups, including the Malay, Chinese, and Indian populations in and around Singapore. Coverage of events related to non-British was typically restricted to court cases or sensationalized crimes, such as the Tok Janggut&#x27;s rebellion in Kelantan in 1915. Under Still&#x27;s editorship, the paper called for better working conditions for Malay, Chinese, and Indian labourers, but on the grounds that it would improve their efficiency and productivity. Still also considered the Asian population of Singapore &quot;untrustworthy&quot; and suggested they should not hold positions of power or serve in the military. Asian reporters at &quot;The Straits Times&quot; experienced discrimination in the workplace and while on assignment. Peter Benson Maxwell, an Indian reporter, arranged an interview with the governor Cecil Clementi via Clementi&#x27;s secretary, but was quickly removed from the premises of the Government House when he arrived in person.

The paper was originally owned by the individual founders before becoming a private company, as it remained until 1950. Its single largest shareholder was the procurer of the Paris Foreign Missions Society, the Reverend N.J. Couvreur, who also served as the chairman of the company&#x27;s board of the directors from 1910 to 1920.

=== Prewar period ===
In the 1920s and 1930s, &quot;The Straits Times&quot; began to face competition from other papers, specifically the &quot;Malaya Tribune&quot;, which promised &quot;frank discussion of Malayan affairs&quot; and &quot;weekly articles by special and well-informed writers, Chinese, Indians, and Muslims&quot;. The &quot;Tribune&quot;, founded in 1914, lagged behind &quot;The Straits Times&quot; in sales and readership, and launched an advertising campaign to increase circulation and move the paper away from its image as the &quot;clerk&#x27;s paper&quot;. It also hired talented journalists, including Leslie Hoffman and T.S. Khoo, who became the editor-in-chief and deputy editor-in-chief, respectively, of &quot;The Straits Times&quot; after World War II. The efforts of the &quot;Malaya Tribune&quot; were successful when, in 1932, its circulation exceeded that of &quot;The Straits Times&quot;. In response to the competition, Seabridge improved the company by building a new office, replacing and updating old printing equipment, hiring local journalists, and beginning delivery upcountry. He also made significant changes to the paper: he expanded coverage of events in Singapore and Malaya; created a Sunday paper; cut the price of the paper to match that of the &quot;Malaya Tribune&quot;; and incorporated pictures, comics, and other eye-catching elements to make the paper more attractive. Particularly with the reduction of cost, the number of subscribers dramatically increased. In 1938, the paper began delivery by air to Kuala Lumpur, where they were taken from the city to rural areas by vans. 

Part of Seabridge&#x27;s attempts to expand circulation was to include &quot;women&#x27;s columns&quot;, particularly by incorporating the voices of the wives of wealthy British planters. 

By 1933, the renewed &quot;Free Press&quot; was unable to maintain the competition with &quot;The Straits Times&quot; and the paper was bought by Seabridge, though it remained more closely affiliated with merchants and lawyers.

===Japanese occupation===
==== Lead-up to occupation ====

In July 1941, Prime Minister Winston Churchill appointed Duff Cooper, a former Minister of Information, to investigate how to coordinate defence policy planning in Asia against the threat of Japanese invasion. Cooper arrived in Singapore in September 1941 and reported that the various civil, governmental, and military elements did not communicate or coordinate well. Seabridge, as chief editor, was highly critical of the lack of planning and efficiency of government officials. Seabridge and F. D. Bisseker, the chairman of the Eastern Smelting Company, strongly urged Cooper to build up the civil defense; Seabridge also back Cooper&#x27;s proposal to institute martial law. Japanese attacks in the northern Malay states began on 8 December 1941, the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Five days later, the commander ordered the evacuation of all European women and children and all military personnel from the island of Penang. Similar evacuations of only Europeans were ordered throughout the month of December, seriously undermining the morale of the much larger Asian population of Singapore and the surrounding British areas. However, Governor Shenton Thomas insisted that the British community of Singapore not flee in the face of the Japanese, that no racial discrimination was to take place in the evacuation of civilians, and that British civil officers stay behind to &quot;look after their Asian charges&quot;. The government also obstructed information of the severity of the situation on the frontlines. On 5 January 1941, &quot;The Straits Times&quot; published the following lead article summarizing the situation.Malaya has now been in the front line for a month. The Northern Settlement is in enemy hands, and fighting is taking place within 200 miles of Singapore. This island has been bombed on several occasions with &#x27;slight damage to civilian property&#x27; and &#x27;a few civilian casualties&#x27;. That is a reasonably accurate summary of all the people of this country have been told of the fighting that is going around them. Vague &#x27;lines&#x27; have been mentioned and there have been sundry &#x27;strategic withdrawals&#x27;. Such generalities provide a very flimsy basis indeed for detailed comment – so flimsy that we do not propose to attempt a task which is very nearly impossible of achievement … The view we propose to put forward here is the view of the middle-class Asiatic who has been asked to help in maintaining morale but finds himself quite unable to do so . . . If the newspapers and the newspaper reading public are to be any help in combatting rumour, they must be supplied with the only things which are of the slightest value in carrying out the task. And those things are facts.

==== Occupation====
On 20 February 1942, five days after the Fall of Singapore, &quot;The Straits Times&quot; was renamed by Japan and became known as &quot;The Shonan Times&quot;, Shonan being the Japanese name for Singapore. The first issue of &quot;The Shonan Times&quot; published a declaration by Tomoyuki Yamashita, announcing that the aim of the Japanese was to establish the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere in order to achieve a &quot;Great Spirit of Cosmocrasy&quot; and &quot;sweep away the arrogant and unrighteous British elements&quot;.

The children&#x27;s newspaper, outlined in the third goal, was published as &quot;Sakura&quot; and included as a free supplement in the 10 June 1942 edition of the &quot;Syonan Shimbun&quot;, though it was later sold separately for one &quot;sen&quot;. In addition to the &quot;Sakura&quot; children&#x27;s newspaper, the &quot;Syonan Shimbun&quot;, in all its iterations, was used by the Japanese government as a way of attempting to create pro-Japanese youth leaders among the multiethnic, multilingual children of Singapore. 

The paper was later published as &quot;The Syonan Times&quot;, &quot;The Syonan Sinbun&quot;, and &quot;The Syonan Shimbun&quot;. The changes in the spelling arose from squabbles between adherents of different romanization systems, namely Hepburn romanization and a standard devised by the Japanese military government (i.e. General Tojo was written as Tozyo). On 8 December 1942, the anniversary of the initial Japanese invasion, the paper was published as the &quot;Syonan Sinbun&quot;, the English-language edition of a Japanese newspaper. It finally became the &quot;Syonan Shimbun&quot; on 8 December 1943. The paper was reverted back to &quot;The Straits Times&quot; on 5 September 1945 as Singapore returned to British colonial rule and subsequently until today.

During this period, the paper was thoroughly pro-Japanese and would often report on Japan&#x27;s war efforts in the Pacific. The newspaper was run by members of the Japanese military propaganda division and included prominent writers such as Masuji Ibuse.

Seabridge and his wife fled Singapore on 11 February 1942 and went to Batavia (present-day Jakarta). From Batavia, Seabridge filed a secret report for the War Cabinet in London in April 1942 on the failure of both military and civilian governments to hold and maintain Singapore&#x27;s defences.Singapore itself was in a state of almost complete chaos from the end of December. Civil Servants who had evacuated from the Malay States sought to set up temporary departments in Singapore for no other apparent reason than the preservation of their jobs. Even the FMS Income Tax Department set itself up in Singapore after the last Federated State had fallen into Japanese hands. The Civil administration cracked badly and broke completely at some points. There was little co-operation with the Services, and many indications of jealousy and fear that outsiders might poach on the preserves of the Civil Servant … The extent to which obstructionists flourished was staggering.

==== As a war propaganda instrument ====
In June 1942, the Military Propaganda Squad launched a campaign, Nippon-Go Popularising Week, to promote the Japanese language among Singaporeans, using the &quot;Syonan Shimbun&quot;. The Propaganda Squad drafted some 150 members of the Japanese literati and assigned them to Singapore (Syonan) under the 25th Army Military Administration. These included notable authors such as the novelist Masuji Ibuse, poet Jimbo Kōtaro, and literary critic Nakajima Kenzo. A document dated 17 May 1942 outlined the four main objectives of Nippon-Go Popularising Week. 

# To promote the study of Japanese during and after Nippon-Go Popularising Week, introduce the Japanese state of affairs in a series of articles, and strengthen the command of conventional Japanese language in the local papers.
# To entreat all Japanese soldiers involved in the constructive war effort to cooperate in teaching correct Japanese to natives. 
# To publish a weekly children&#x27;s katakana newspaper.
# To publish a guidebook on the proper pronunciation of Japanese syllables.

The children&#x27;s newspaper, outlined in the third goal, was published as &quot;Sakura&quot; and included as a free supplement in the 10 June 1942 edition of the &quot;Syonan Shimbun&quot;, though it was later sold separately for one &quot;sen&quot;. 

===Post-war===

On 11 March 1950, &quot;The Straits Times&quot; became a public limited company.

In 1956, &quot;The Straits Times&quot; established a Malayan (now Malaysian) edition, the &quot;New Straits Times&quot;, based in Kuala Lumpur. Since the separation of the two countries, these newspapers are now unaffiliated with each other. During the early days of Singaporean self-governance (before 1965), the paper, who had a pro-colonial stance, had an uneasy relationship with some politicians. This included the leaders of the People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP), who desired self-governance for Singapore. 

Editors were warned by British colonial officials that any reportage that may threaten the merger between Singapore and the Malayan Federation may result in subversion charges, and that they may be detained without trial under the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance Act.

During the Malayan Emergency, &quot;The Straits Times&quot; published cash bounties for information leading to the killing or capture of senior communists. Earlier during the Emergency, The &quot;Straits Times&quot; had erroneously reported that 26 suspected communist guerrillas had been shot dead by the British military while attempting to escape after ammunition had been discovered in their homes. However, it was later discovered that 24 people had been shot dead, and that all of them were innocent civilians who had been executed as part of the Batang Kali massacre by the Scots Guards regiment; an event described by historians as the British Mỹ Lai.

===Post-independence===

After Singapore gained its independence in 1965, the newspaper has since been referred to as Singapore&#x27;s newspaper of record. Despite its history as being largely anti-PAP and anti-independence when Singapore was a colony, it has become largely pro-PAP after independence. The news website of &quot;The Straits Times&quot; launched on 1 January 1994, making it one of the first newspapers in the world to do so. The website remained entirely free until 2005 when paid subscription became required to fully access news and commentary.

====Government interference====
Prior to 1965, during the early days of Singaporean self-governance, the paper had an uneasy relationship with some politicians, including the leaders of the People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP). This was partially due to Hoffman criticising the PAP during the 1959 general election and supporting the eventually defeated chief minister Lim Yew Hock. Editors were warned that any reportage that may threaten the merger between Singapore and the Malayan Federation may result in subversion charges, and that they may be detained without trial under the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance Act. Following criticism of the paper&#x27;s coverage from Lee Kuan Yew after the 1979 by-elections and the 1980 general election, &quot;The Straits Times&quot; agreed to accept S.R. Nathan, a government nominee and the former Director of Internal Security, as its executive chairman. Subsequently, the Singaporean government restructured the entire newspaper industry, in which all papers published in English, Chinese, and Malay were brought under Singapore Press Holdings (SPH), established on 30 November 1984. Following the establishment of the conglomerate, &quot;The Straits Times&quot;, and the other subsidiaries, were allowed to maintain its own board of directors and editorial staff.

The newspaper is sometimes referred as &quot;the mouthpiece&quot; of the ruling party, or at least &quot;mostly pro-government&quot;, as well as &quot;close to the government&quot;. Chua Chin Hon, then ST&#x27;s bureau chief for the United States, was quoted as saying that SPH&#x27;s &quot;editors have all been groomed as pro-government supporters and are careful to ensure that reporting of local events adheres closely to the official line&quot; in a 2009 US diplomatic cable leaked by WikiLeaks. Past chairpersons of Singapore Press Holdings have been civil or public servants. The SPH Chairman before the SPH media restructuring, Lee Boon Yang, was a former PAP cabinet minister who took over from Tony Tan, former Deputy Prime Minister. Many current ST management and senior editors have close links to the government as well. SPH CEO Alan Chan was a former top civil servant and Principal Private Secretary to then Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew. Current editor-in-chief Warren Fernandez was considered as a PAP candidate for the 2006 elections.
In his memoir &quot;OB Markers: My Straits Times Story&quot;, former editor-in-chief Cheong Yip Seng, alleged how the newspaper has a government-appointed &quot;monitor&quot; at the newspaper, &quot;someone who could watch to see if indeed the newsroom was beyond control&quot;, and that disapproval of the &quot;monitor&quot; could cost a reporter or editor from being internally promoted. Cheong identified the first monitor as S. R. Nathan, director of the Ministry of Defence&#x27;s Security and Intelligence Division and later president of Singapore. Editors were bound by &quot;out of bounds markers&quot; to denote what topics are permissible for public discussion, such as anything that may produce ill-will and hostility between different races and religious groups.

==== 2023 circulation scandal ====
Following a 2023 leak published on socio-political website Wake Up, Singapore, &quot;the Straits Times&quot; revealed that SPH Media inflated its circulation figures in 2022 by 85-95,000 copies daily across all publications, or 10-12% of the reported daily average circulation. The numbers were inflated by means such as including copies that were printed and counted for circulation but destroyed, fictitious counts, and double-counting subscriptions.   

==Coverage==
&quot;The Straits Times&quot; functions with 16 bureaus and special correspondents in major cities worldwide. The paper has five sections: the main section consist of Asian and international news, with sub-sections of columns and editorials and the Forum Page (letters to the press). The Home section consist of local news and topics on Education for Monday, Mind and Body for Tuesday, Digital for Wednesday, Community for Thursday and Science for Friday. There are also a sports and finance section, a classified ads and job listing section and a lifestyle, style, entertainment and the arts section titled &quot;Life!&quot;.

The newspaper also publishes special editions for primary and secondary schools in Singapore. The primary-school version contains a special pull-out, titled &quot;Little Red Dot&quot; and the secondary-school version contains a pull-out titled &quot;In&quot;.

A separate edition &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; is published on Sundays.

===International editions===
A specific Myanmar and Brunei edition of this paper was launched on 25 March 2014 and 30 October 2014. It is published daily with local newspaper printers on licence with SPH. This paper is distributed on ministries, businesses, major hotels, airlines, bookshops and supermarkets on major cities and target sales to local and foreign businessmen in both countries. Circulation of the Myanmar edition currently stands at 5,000 and 2,500 for the Brunei edition. The Brunei edition is currently sold at B$1 per copy and an All-in-One &quot;Straits Times&quot; package consisting of the print edition and full digital access via online, tablets and smartphones, will also be introduced in Brunei.

===&quot;Straits Times&quot; Online===
Launched on 1 January 1994, &quot;The Straits Times&quot;″ website was free of charge and granted access to all the sections and articles found in the print edition. On 1 January 2005, the online version began requiring registration and after a short period became a paid-access-only site. Currently, only people who subscribe to the online edition can read all the articles on the Internet, including the frequently updated &quot;Latest News&quot; section.

A free section, featuring a selection of news stories, is currently available at the site. Regular podcast, vodcast and twice-daily—mid-day and evening updates—radio-news bulletins are also available for free online.

== Preservation ==
In July 2007, the National Library Board signed an agreement with the Singapore Press Holdings to digitise the archives of &quot;The Straits Times&quot; going back to its founding in 1845. The archived materials are held in the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library and are available to the public through microfilm.

==Community programmes==
===&quot;The Straits Times&quot; School Pocket Money Fund===
&quot;The Straits Times&quot; School Pocket Money Fund was initiated on 1 October 2000 by &quot;The Straits Times&quot;, to heighten public awareness of the plight of children from low-income families who were attending school without proper breakfast, or pocket money to sustain their day in school. The aim is to alleviate the financial burden faced by parents in providing for their children&#x27;s education. At the same time the funds will help children who are already facing difficulties in remaining in school to stay on.

===&quot;The Straits Times&quot; Schools===
&quot;The Straits Times&quot; Schools is a news desk created to encourage youth readership and interest in news and current affairs. Launched in 2004, the programme was initially known as &quot;The Straits Times&quot; Media Club. Youth newspapers, &quot;IN&quot; and &quot;Little Red Dot&quot; are produced on a weekly basis for secondary and primary school students respectively, whose schools would have to subscribe in bulk. Students will receive their papers every Monday together with the main broadsheet. On 7 March 2017, a digital &quot;IN&quot; app was launched, allowing parents, students and other individual ST subscribers to subscribe to &quot;IN&quot; weekly releases digitally.

==Public opinion==
A 2020 Reuters Institute independent survey of 15 media outlets found that 73% of Singaporean respondents trusted reporting from &quot;The Straits Times&quot;, the second highest rating next to Channel NewsAsia (CNA), a local TV news channel.

<doc id="411021" wikidata="Q131065" url="?curid=411021" title="Chlamydia trachomatis">
<text>Chlamydia trachomatis () is a Gram-negative, anaerobic bacterium responsible for chlamydia and trachoma. &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; exists in two forms, an extracellular infectious elementary body (EB) and an intracellular non-infectious reticulate body (RB). The EB attaches to host cells and enter the cell using effector proteins, where it transforms into the metabolically active RB. Inside the cell, RBs rapidly replicate before transitioning back to EBs, which are then released to infect new host cells.

The earliest description of &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; was in 1907 by Stanislaus von Prowazek and Ludwig Halberstädter as a protozoan. It was later thought to be a virus due to its small size and inability to grow in laboratories. It was not until 1966 when it was discovered as a bacterium by electron microscopy after its internal structures were visually observed.

There are currently 18 serovars of &quot;C. trachomatis,&quot; each associated with specific diseases affecting mucosal cells in the lungs, genital tracts, and ocular systems. Infections are often asymptomatic, but can lead to severe complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease in women and epididymitis in men. The bacterium also causes urethritis, conjunctivitis, and lymphogranuloma venereum in both sexes. &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; genitourinary infections are diagnosed more frequently in women than in men, with the highest prevalence occurring in females aged 15 to 19 years of age. Infants born from mothers with active chlamydia infections have a pulmonary infection rate that is less than 10%. Globally, approximately 84 million people are affected by &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; eye infections, with 8 million cases resulting in blindness. &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; is the leading infectious cause of blindness and the most common sexually transmitted bacterium.&quot;&quot;

The impact of &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; on human health has been driving vaccine research since its discovery. Currently, no vaccines are available, largely due to the complexity of the immunological pathways involved in &quot;C. trachomatis&quot;, which remain poorly understood. However, &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; infections may be treated with several antibiotics, with tetracycline being the preferred option.

==Description==
&quot;Chlamydia trachomatis&quot; is a gram-negative bacterium that replicates exclusively within a host cell, making it an obligate intracellular pathogen. Over the course of its life cycle, &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; takes on two distinct forms to facilitate infection and replication. Elementary bodies (EBs) are 200 to 400 nanometers across and are surrounded by a rigid cell wall that enables them to survive in an extracellular form. When an EB encounters a susceptible host cell, it binds to the cell surface and is internalized. The second form, reticulate bodies (RBs) are 600 to 1500 nanometers across, and are found only within host cells. RBs have increased metabolic activity and are adapted for replication. Neither form is motile.

The evolution of &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; includes a reduced genome of approximately 1.04 megabases, encoding approximately 900 genes. In addition to the chromosome that contains most of the genome, nearly all &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; strains carry a 7.5 kilobase plasmid that contains 8 genes. The role of this plasmid is unknown, although strains without the plasmid have been isolated, suggesting it is not essential for bacterial survival. Several important metabolic functions are not encoded in the &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; genome and are instead scavenged from the host cell.

=== Carbohydrate metabolism ===
&quot;C. trachomatis&quot; has a reduced metabolic capacity due to its smaller genome, which lacks genes for many biosynthetic pathways including those required for complete carbohydrate metabolism. The bacterium is largely dependent on the host cell for metabolic intermediates and energy, particularly in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; lacks several enzymes necessary for independent glucose metabolism, and instead utilizes two ATP/ADP translocases (Npt1 and Npt2) to import ATP from the host cell. Other metabolites including amino acids, nucleotides, and lipids are also transported from the host.

A critical enzyme involved in glycolysis, hexokinase, is absent in &quot;C. trachomatis,&quot; preventing the production of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). Instead, G6P from the host cell is taken up by the metabolically active reticulate bodies (RBs) through a G6P transporter (UhpC antiporter). Although &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; lacks a complete independent glycolysis pathway, it has genes encoding for all the enzymes required for the Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP), gluconeogenesis, and glycogen synthesis and degradation.

A suppressor of glycolysis, p53, is expressed less frequently in &quot;c. trachomatis&quot; cells, increasing the rate at which glycolysis occurs, even in the presence of oxygen. As a result, &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; infection is associated with increased production of pyruvate, lactate, and glutamate by the bacterium due to activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 2 enzyme limiting conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-coenzyme A. The pyruvate is instead turned into lactate, which allows the cell to grow almost unobstructed by immune response due to the acidic properties of lactate. Excess glycolytic products are, in turn, brought into the PPP to create nucleotides and for biosynthesis. This type of growth is very similar to the Warburg effect observed in cancer cells.

==Life cycle==

Like other &quot;Chlamydia&quot; species, &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; has a life cycle consisting of two morphologically distinct forms. First, &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; attaches to a new host cell as a small spore-like form called the elementary body. The elementary body enters the host cell, surrounded by a host vacuole, called an inclusion. Within the inclusion, &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; transforms into a larger, more metabolically active form called the reticulate body. The reticulate body substantially modifies the inclusion, making it a more hospitable environment for rapid replication of the bacteria, which occurs over the following 30 to 72 hours. The massive number of intracellular bacteria then transition back to resistant elementary bodies before causing the cell to rupture and being released into the environment. These new elementary bodies are then shed in the semen or released from epithelial cells of the female genital tract and attach to new host cells.

==Classification==
&quot;C. trachomatis&quot; are bacteria in the genus &quot;Chlamydia&quot;, a group of obligate intracellular parasites of eukaryotic cells. Chlamydial cells cannot carry out energy metabolism and they lack biosynthetic pathways.

&quot;C. trachomatis&quot; strains are generally divided into three biovars based on the type of disease they cause. These are further subdivided into several serovars based on the surface antigens recognized by the immune system. Serovars A through C cause trachoma, which is the world&#x27;s leading cause of preventable infectious blindness. Serovars D through K infect the genital tract, causing pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancies, and infertility. Serovars L1 through L3 cause an invasive infection of the lymph nodes near the genitals, called lymphogranuloma venereum.

&quot;C. trachomatis&quot; is thought to have diverged from other &quot;Chlamydia&quot; species around 6 million years ago. This genus contains a total of nine species: &quot;C. trachomatis&quot;, &quot;C. muridarum&quot;, &quot;C. pneumoniae&quot;, &quot;C. pecorum&quot;, &quot;C. suis&quot;, &quot;C. abortus&quot;, &quot;C. felis&quot;, &quot;C. caviae&quot;, and &quot;C. psittaci&quot;. The closest relative to &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; is &quot;C. muridarum&quot;, which infects mice. &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; along with &quot;C. pneumoniae&quot; have been found to infect humans to a greater extent. &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; exclusively infects humans. &quot;C. pneumoniae&quot; is found to also infect horses, marsupials, and frogs. Some of the other species can have a considerable impact on human health due to their known zoonotic transmission.
==Role in disease==
Clinical signs and symptoms of &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; infection in the genitalia present as the chlamydia infection, which may be asymptomatic or may resemble a gonorrhea infection.
Both are common causes of multiple other conditions including pelvic inflammatory disease and urethritis.

&quot;C. trachomatis&quot; is the single most important infectious agent associated with blindness (trachoma), and it also affects the eyes in the form of inclusion conjunctivitis and is responsible for about 19% of adult cases of conjunctivitis.

&quot;C. trachomatis&quot; in the lungs presents as the chlamydia pneumoniae respiratory infection and can affect all ages.

===Pathogenesis===
Elementary bodies are generally present in the semen of infected men and vaginal secretions of infected women. When they come into contact with a new host cell, the elementary bodies bind to the cell via interaction between adhesins on their surface and several host receptor proteins and heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Once attached, the bacteria inject various effector proteins into the host cell using a type three secretion system. These effectors trigger the host cell to take up the elementary bodies and prevent the cell from triggering apoptosis. Within 6 to 8 hours after infection, the elementary bodies transition to reticulate bodies and a number of new effectors are synthesized. These effectors include a number of proteins that modify the inclusion membrane (Inc proteins), as well as proteins that redirect host vesicles to the inclusion. 8 to 16 hours after infection, another set of effectors are synthesized, driving acquisition of nutrients from the host cell. At this stage, the reticulate bodies begin to divide, coinciding with the expansion of the inclusion. If several elementary bodies have infected a single cell, their inclusions will fuse at this point to create a single large inclusion in the host cell. From 24 to 72 hours after infection, reticulate bodies transition to elementary bodies which are released either by lysis of the host cell or extrusion of the entire inclusion into the host genital tract.

=== Virulence factors ===
The chlamydial plasmid, a DNA molecule existing separately from the genome of &quot;C. trachomatis&quot;, functions to enhance genetic diversity via the genes encoded. The plasmid gene protein 3 (&quot;pgp3&quot;) has been linked to the establishment of persistent infection within the genital tract by suppressing the host immune response.

Polymorphic outer membrane proteins (Pmp proteins) on the surface of &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; use tropism to bind specific host cell receptors, which in turn initiates infection. Pmp proteins B, D, and H have been most associated with eliciting a pro-inflammatory response through the release of cytokines.

CPAF (Chlamydia Protease-like Activity Factor) functions by preventing the host from triggering the proper immune response. &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; use of CPAF targets and cleaves proteins that restructure the Golgi apparatus and activate DNA repair so that &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; is able to use the host cell machinery and proteins to its advantage.

===Presentation===
Most people infected with &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; are asymptomatic. However, the bacteria can present in one of three ways: genitourinary (genitals), pulmonary (lungs), and ocular (eyes).

Genitourinary cases can include genital discharge, vaginal bleeding, itchiness (pruritus), painful urination (dysuria), among other symptoms. Often, symptoms are similar to those of a urinary tract infection.

When &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; presents in the eye in the form of trachoma, it begins by gradually thickening the eyelids and eventually begins to pull the eyelashes into the eyelid. In the form of inclusion conjunctivitis, the infection presents with redness, swelling, mucopurulent discharge from the eye, and most other symptoms associated with adult conjunctivitis.

&quot;C. trachomatis&quot; may latently infect the chorionic villi tissues of pregnant women, thereby impacting pregnancy outcome.

===Prevalence===
Three times as many women are diagnosed with genitourinary &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; infections as men. Women aged 15–19 have the highest prevalence, followed by women aged 20–24, although the rate of increase of diagnosis is greater for men than for women. Risk factors for genitourinary infections include unprotected sex with multiple partners, lack of condom use, and low socioeconomic status living in urban areas.

Pulmonary infections can occur in infants born to women with active chlamydia infections, although the rate of infection is less than 10%.

Ocular infections take the form of inclusion conjunctivitis or trachoma, both in adults and children. About 84 million worldwide develop &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; eye infections and 8 million are blinded as a result of the infection. Trachoma is the primary source of infectious blindness in some parts of rural Africa and Asia and is a neglected tropical disease that has been targeted by the World Health Organization for elimination by 2020. Inclusion conjunctivitis from &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; is responsible for about 19% of adult cases of conjunctivitis.

===Treatment===
Treatment depends on the infection site, age of the patient, and whether another infection is present. Having a &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; and one or more other sexually transmitted infections at the same time is possible. Treatment is often done with both partners simultaneously to prevent reinfection. &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; may be treated with several antibiotic medications, including azithromycin, erythromycin, ofloxacin, and tetracycline.

Tetracycline is the most preferred antibiotic to treat &quot;C.trachomatis&quot; and has the highest success rate&quot;.&quot; Azithromycin and doxycycline have equal efficacy to treat &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; with 97 and 98 percent success, respectively. Azithromycin is dosed as a 1 gram tablet that is taken by mouth as a single dose, primarily to help with concerns of non-adherence. Treatment with generic doxycycline 100  mg twice a day for 7 days has equal success with expensive delayed-release doxycycline 200 mg once a day for 7 days. Erythromycin is less preferred as it may cause gastrointestinal side effects, which can lead to non-adherence. Levofloxacin and ofloxacin are generally no better than azithromycin or doxycycline and are more expensive.

If treatment is necessary during pregnancy, levofloxacin, ofloxacin, tetracycline, and doxycycline are not prescribed. In the case of a patient who is pregnant, the medications typically prescribed are azithromycin, amoxicillin, and erythromycin. Azithromycin is the recommended medication and is taken as a 1 gram tablet taken by mouth as a single dose. Despite amoxicillin having fewer side effects than the other medications for treating antenatal &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; infection, there have been concerns that pregnant women who take penicillin-class antibiotics can develop a chronic persistent chlamydia infection. Tetracycline is not used because some children and even adults can not withstand the drug, causing harm to the mother and fetus. Retesting during pregnancy can be performed three weeks after treatment. If the risk of reinfection is high, screening can be repeated throughout pregnancy.

If the infection has progressed, ascending the reproductive tract and pelvic inflammatory disease develops, damage to the fallopian tubes may have already occurred. In most cases, the &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; infection is then treated on an outpatient basis with azithromycin or doxycycline. Treating the mother of an infant with &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; of the eye, which can evolve into pneumonia, is recommended. The recommended treatment consists of oral erythromycin base or ethylsuccinate 50 mg/kg/day divided into four doses daily for two weeks while monitoring for symptoms of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) in infants less than 6 weeks old.

There have been a few reported cases of &quot;C.trachomatis&quot; strains that were resistant to multiple antibiotic treatments. However, as of 2018, this is not a major cause of concern as antibiotic resistance is rare in &quot;C.trachomatis&quot; compared to other infectious bacteria.

===Laboratory tests===

&quot;Chlamydia&quot; species are readily identified and distinguished from other &quot;Chlamydia&quot; species using DNA-based tests. Tests for Chlamydia can be ordered from a doctor, a lab or online.

Most strains of &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; are recognized by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to epitopes in the VS4 region of MOMP. However, these mAbs may also cross-react with two other &quot;Chlamydia&quot; species, &quot;C. suis&quot; and &quot;C. muridarum&quot;.
* Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) tests find the genetic material (DNA) of &quot;Chlamydia&quot; bacteria. These tests are the most sensitive tests available, meaning they are very accurate and are unlikely to have false-negative test results. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test is an example of a nucleic acid amplification test. This test can also be done on a urine sample, urethral swabs in men, or cervical or vaginal swabs in women.
* Nucleic acid hybridization tests (DNA probe test) also find &quot;Chlamydia&quot; DNA. A probe test is very accurate but is not as sensitive as NAATs.
* Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, EIA) finds substances (&quot;Chlamydia&quot; antigens) that trigger the immune system to fight &quot;Chlamydia&quot; infection. Chlamydia Elementary body (EB)-ELISA could be used to stratify different stages of infection based upon Immunoglobulin-γ status of the infected individuals 
* Direct fluorescent antibody test also finds &quot;Chlamydia&quot; antigens.
* &quot;Chlamydia&quot; cell culture is a test in which the suspected &quot;Chlamydia&quot; sample is grown in a vial of cells. The pathogen infects the cells, and after a set incubation time (48 hours), the vials are stained and viewed on a fluorescent light microscope. Cell culture is more expensive and takes longer (two days) than the other tests. The culture must be grown in a laboratory.

==Research==
Studies have revealed antibiotic resistance in &quot;Chlamydia trachomatis&quot;. Mutations in the 23S rRNA gene, including A2057G and A2059G, have been identified as significant contributors to resistance against azithromycin, a commonly used treatment. This resistance is linked to treatment failures and persistent infections, necessitating ongoing research into alternative antibiotics, such as moxifloxacin, as well as non-antibiotic approaches like bacteriophage therapy. These innovations aim to combat resistance while reducing the overall burden of antibiotic misuse, which has been closely associated with the rise of resistant strains in &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; populations.

Additionally, diagnostic improvements have played a vital role in identifying &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; infections more efficiently. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), such as DNA- and RNA-based tests, have shown high sensitivity and specificity, making them the gold standard for detecting asymptomatic infections. NAATs have facilitated broader screening programs, particularly in high-risk populations, and are integral to public health initiatives aimed at controlling the spread of &quot;C. trachomatis&quot;. Research continues into point-of-care diagnostic tools, which promise faster results and greater accessibility, especially in low-resource settings.

In the area of vaccine development, creating an effective vaccine for &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; has proven challenging due to the complex immune responses the bacterium elicits. Subunit vaccines, which target outer membrane proteins like MOMP (Major Outer Membrane Protein) and polymorphic membrane proteins (Pmp), are being explored in both animal models and early human trials. While these vaccines show promise in inducing partial immunity in murine models, further research is needed to evaluate their efficacy in humans. The goal is to develop a vaccine that can prevent reinfection without causing harmful inflammatory responses.

==History==
&quot;C. trachomatis&quot; was first described in 1907 by Stanislaus von Prowazek and Ludwig Halberstädter in scrapings from trachoma cases. Thinking they had discovered a &quot;mantled protozoan&quot;, they named the organism &quot;Chlamydozoa&quot; from the Greek &quot;Chlamys&quot; meaning mantle. Over the next several decades, &quot;Chlamydozoa&quot; was thought to be a virus as it was small enough to pass through bacterial filters and unable to grow on known laboratory media. However, in 1966, electron microscopy studies showed &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; to be a bacterium. This is essentially due to the fact that they were found to possess DNA, RNA, and ribosomes like other bacteria. It was originally believed that Chlamydia lacked peptidoglycan because researchers were unable to detect muramic acid in cell extracts. Subsequent studies determined that &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; synthesizes both muramic acid and peptidoglycan, but relegates it to the microbe&#x27;s division septum and does not utilize it for construction of a cell wall. The bacterium is still classified as gram-negative.

&quot;C. trachomatis&quot; agent was first cultured and isolated in the yolk sacs of eggs by Tang Fei-fan &quot;et al.&quot; in 1957. This was a significant milestone because it became possible to preserve these agents, which could then be used for future genomic and phylogenetic studies. The isolation of &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; coined the term isolate to describe how &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; has been isolated from an &quot;in vivo&quot; setting into a &quot;strain&quot; in cell culture. Only a few &quot;isolates&quot; have been studied in detail, limiting the information that can be found on the evolutionary history of &quot;C. trachomatis&quot;.

== Evolution ==
In the 1990s it was shown that there are several species of &quot;Chlamydia&quot;. &quot;Chlamydia trachomatis&quot; was first described in historical records in Ebers papyrus written between 1553 and 1550 BC. In the ancient world, it was known as the blinding disease trachoma. The disease may have been closely linked with humans and likely predated civilization. It is now known that &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; comprises 19 serovars which are identified by monoclonal antibodies that react to epitopes on the major outer-membrane protein (MOMP). Comparison of amino acid sequences reveals that MOMP contains four variable segments: S1,2 ,3 and 4. Different variants of the gene that encodes for MOMP, differentiate the genotypes of the different serovars. The antigenic relatedness of the serovars reflects the homology levels of DNA between MOMP genes, especially within these segments.

Furthermore, there have been over 220 &quot;Chlamydia&quot; vaccine trials done on mice and other non-human host species to target &quot;C. muridarum&quot; and &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; strains. However, it has been difficult to translate these results to the human species due to physiological and anatomical differences. Future trials are working with closely related species to humans.

<doc id="411022" wikidata="Q748192" url="?curid=411022" title="Eastern phoebe">
<text>The eastern phoebe (Sayornis phoebe) is a small passerine bird. The genus name &quot;Sayornis&quot; is constructed from the specific part of Charles Lucien Bonaparte&#x27;s name for Say&#x27;s phoebe, &quot;Muscicapa saya&quot;, and Ancient Greek &quot;ornis&quot;, &quot;bird&quot;. &quot;Phoebe&quot; is an alternative name for the Roman moon-goddess Diana, but it may also have been chosen to imitate the bird&#x27;s call.

== Description ==
Measurements:

* Length: 5.5–6.7 in (14–17 cm)
* Weight: 0.6–0.7 oz (16–21 g)
* Wingspan: 10.2–11.0 in (26–28 cm)

This species appears remarkably big-headed, especially if it puffs up the small crest. Its plumage is gray-brown above. It has a white throat, dirty gray breast and buffish underparts which become whiter during the breeding season. Two indistinct buff bars are present on each wing. Its lack of an eye ring and wingbars, and its all dark bill distinguish it from other North American tyrant flycatchers, and it pumps its tail up and down like other phoebes when perching on a branch. The eastern phoebe&#x27;s call is a sharp &quot;chip&quot;, and the song, from which it gets its name, is &quot;fee-bee&quot;.

The eastern wood pewee (&quot;Contopus virens&quot;) is extremely similar in appearance. It lacks the buff hue usually present on the lighter parts of the eastern phoebe&#x27;s plumage, and thus has always clearly defined and contrasting wing-bars. It also does not bob its tail habitually, and appears on the breeding grounds much later though it leaves for winter quarters at about the same time as the eastern phoebe.

It often nests on human structures such as bridges and buildings. Nesting activity may start as early as the first days of April. The nest is an open cup with a mud base and lined with moss and grass, built in crevice in a rock or man-made site; two to six eggs are laid. Both parents feed the young and usually raise two broods per year. The eastern phoebe is occasionally host to the nest-parasitic brown-headed cowbird (&quot;Molothrus ater&quot;).

== Habitat ==
Eastern phoebes are highly adaptable to urban environments. They are primarily found in wooded areas, particularly streamsides, and farmlands. Eastern phoebes tend to avoid open areas and choose spots beneath trees, brushy areas or overhangs. However, during migration in winters or in breeding season they are frequently seen around the edges of woods and other areas where water sources are abundant.

== Breeding ==
The eastern phoebe breeds in eastern North America excluding the southeastern coastal United States. The breeding habitat is open woodland, farmland and suburbs, often near water. This phoebe is insectivorous, and often perches conspicuously when seeking food items. It also eats fruits and berries in cooler weather.

== Diet ==
Insects make up a great majority of its summer diet; included are many small wasps, bees, beetles, flies, true bugs, and grasshoppers. It also eats some spiders, ticks, and millipedes. Small fruits and berries are eaten often during the cooler months.

== Migration ==
It is migratory, wintering in the southernmost United States and Central America. It is a very rare vagrant to western Europe. This is one of the first birds to return to the breeding grounds in spring and one of the last to leave in the fall. They arrive for breeding in mid-late March, but they return to winter quarters around the same time when other migrant songbirds do, in September and early October; migration times have stayed the same in the last 100 years. The increase in trees throughout the Great Plains during the past century due to fire suppression and tree planting facilitated a western range expansion of the eastern phoebe as well as range expansions of many other species of birds.

== In literature ==
Phoebes appear in the poem &quot;The Need of Being Versed in Country Things&quot;, published in 1923 by Robert Frost. The poem describes phoebes nesting inside a barn on a farm abandoned after the farmhouse burned to the ground. The poem ends &quot;One had to be versed in country things/Not to believe the phoebes wept&quot;.

They also appear in the Mary Oliver poem &quot;The Messenger&quot;.

<text>The Hurva Synagogue (), also known as Hurvat Rabbi Yehudah he-Hasid (), is an Orthodox Jewish congregation and synagogue, located in the Jewish Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem.

It was originally founded in the early 18th century by followers of Judah HeHasid on the ruins of a 15th century synagogue and adjacent to the 14th century Sidna Omar mosque, but it was destroyed in 1721 by local lenders over a debt dispute. The plot became known as &quot;The Ruin&quot;, or &quot;Hurva&quot;, where it lay desolate for 116 years until it was resettled in 1837 by members of the Ashkenazi Jewish community, known as the &quot;Perushim&quot;. In 1856, the Ottoman Sultan Abdelmecid issued a &quot;firman&quot; authorizing the construction of a synagogue at the site, and the sultan&#x27;s chief architect, Assad Bey, designed it and oversaw its construction. Construction began in 1864, and although officially named the Beis Yaakov Synagogue, it retained its name as the Hurva. It became Jerusalem&#x27;s main Ashkenazi synagogue, until it was destroyed on May 27, during the fighting of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Israel claims Arabs deliberately destroyed it, while Jordanian and Palestinian sources state the Jordanian army was forced to shell the synagogue after the Zionist forces used its high rooftops for military purposes.

After Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan in 1967, a number of plans were submitted for the design of a new building. After years of deliberation and indecision, a commemorative arch was erected instead at the site in 1977, itself becoming a prominent landmark of the Jewish Quarter. The plan to rebuild the synagogue in its 19th-century style received approval by the Israeli Government in 2000, and the newly rebuilt synagogue was dedicated on March 15, 2010.
==History==
===Early history===

The Hurva Synagogue today stands off a plaza in the centre of Jerusalem&#x27;s Jewish Quarter, adjacent to the 14th century Sidna Omar mosque. Excavations carried out at the site in July and August 2003 revealed evidence from four main settlement periods: First Temple (800–600 BCE), Second Temple (100 CE), Byzantine and Ottoman. Three bedrock-hewn mikvehs (ritual baths) were uncovered there dating from the 1st century. The earliest tradition regarding the site is of a synagogue existing there at the time of the second-century sage Judah HaNasi I.

===Judah heHasid and aftermath: 1700s===
In the winter of 1700, a group of around 500 Ashkenazim led by Judah HeHasid arrived from Poland to the region of Palestine. They were mystics who were intent on advancing the arrival of the Messianic Era by settling in Jerusalem and leading ascetic lives. A few days after their arrival in the city, heHasid died, and without a leader, their messianic hopes dissipated and the community began to disintegrate. Those who remained managed to build forty dwellings and a small synagogue in the Ashkenazic Compound. Soon after, they endeavoured to construct a larger synagogue, but the task proved expensive. They found themselves having to bribe the Ottoman authorities in order to enable them to proceed with their building project. Unexpected costs relating to the construction, financial hardships and the burden of various other taxes drained their funds. They became impoverished and were forced to take loans from local Arabs, eventually falling into severe debt. Pressure and threats from the creditors led to a &quot;meshulach&quot; (rabbinical emissary) being sent abroad to solicit funds for repayment of the loans. In late 1720, with the debts still outstanding, the Arab lenders lost patience and set the synagogue and its contents alight. The leaders of the community were imprisoned and shortly after, not only this group but all other Ashkenazim were banished from the city, an interdiction which remained until statute of limitations on the synagogue loans expired roughly a century later. Over the course of time, shops were built in the courtyard and the synagogue was left desolate, in a pile of rubble. It thus became known as the &quot;Ruin of Rabbi Judah heHasid&quot;.

===Efforts of the Perushim: 1812–1837===

Between 1808 and 1812 another group of ascetic Jews, known as Perushim, immigrated to Palestine from Lithuania. They were disciples of the Vilna Gaon and had settled in the city of Safed to the north. Some had wished to settle in Jerusalem and reclaim the Ashkenazic Compound. They were worried, however, that descendants of the Arab creditors still held the old promissory notes relating to the century-old debts incurred by he-Hasid&#x27;s followers and that a new group of Ashkenazic immigrants would possibly inherit responsibility for repayment. The descendants of a group of Hasidim who made &quot;aliyah&quot; in 1777 also presented a problem. They apparently objected to any effort by the Perushim to take control of the synagogue ruin, claiming it had never belonged to the Perushim or their ancestors. The Hasidim claimed they had closer ties with the original owners and that their rights to the parcel of land were greater.

Nevertheless, in late 1815, leader of the Safed Perushim, Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Shklov, arrived in Jerusalem with a group of followers. They directed their main efforts to rebuilding he-Hasid&#x27;s synagogue, which had symbolised the expulsion of the Ashkenazim from Jerusalem. By this, they intended to demonstrate the re-establishment of Ashkenazic presence in the city. Rebuilding one of Jerusalem&#x27;s ruins would also have symbolic kabbalistic significance. The &quot;repairing&quot; of an earlier destruction would represent the first step of rebuilding the entire city, a prerequisite for the arrival of the Messiah.

In 1816 they &quot;pleaded with the powers in the city of Constantinople to obtain a royal decree that the Arabs residing in Jerusalem would not be permitted to enforce the debts of the Ashkenazim&quot;, but nothing came of it. A year later, several leaders of the group, including Avraham Shlomo Zalman Zoref, a Lithuanian-born silversmith, and Soloman Pach, travelled to Constantinople endeavouring to obtain such a &quot;firman&quot; (imperial decree). Two years later, in 1819, their efforts were realised and the century-old debts were cancelled. The group acquired a legal document delineating the entire site acquired by he-Hasid in 1700. The area now included dilapidated dwellings and shops built by the creditors&#x27; heirs on part of the site. Next, they had to secure another &quot;firman&quot; that would permit construction at the site, including the building of a large synagogue. Two successive missions in 1820 and 1821 to obtain the &quot;firman&quot; from the sultan&#x27;s court failed.

Still awaiting imperial permission to build in the courtyard, the Perushim wished to rely on an old &quot;firman&quot; given to the Jews in 1623, which stated that there could be no objection to them building in their own quarters. Having received a supporting document issued by the Qadi of Jerusalem in March 1824, it was possible for them begin rebuilding the dwellings in the courtyard. In practice, however, construction never materialised as they were unable to exercise their authority over the plot of land. This was apparently due to confrontation with the Arab squatters and the local government&#x27;s disregard of the documents proving their ownership of the courtyard.

In 1825, following the disruption the group were experiencing, Shapira travelled to Europe once again. He hoped to secure the necessary &quot;firman&quot;, which would place the courtyard firmly in the Perushim&#x27;s possession, and also to raise funds to cover the costs incurred trying to redeem the courtyard. His mission, however, was unsuccessful, as was a later mission attempted in 1829 by Zoref.

====Egypt gives ambiguous consent====
With the annexation of Jerusalem by Egypt in 1831, a new opportunity arose for the Perushim. They petitioned Muhammad Ali regarding the rebuilding of the synagogue, but concerns about deviating from longstanding Muslim tradition and the Pact of Umar (which restricted the repair or construction of non-Muslim houses of worship) meant permission was not forthcoming. However, five months after the earthquake of May 1834, the prohibition was relaxed and the Sephardim were allowed to carry out repair works to their existing synagogues. This consent gave rise to further efforts by the Ashkenazim to receive authorisation to rebuild theirs.

On June 23, 1836, after traveling to Egypt, Zoref, together with the backing of the Austrian and Russian consuls in Alexandria, obtained the long-awaited &quot;firman&quot;. It seems he was successful in gaining support of the Austrian consul and Muhammad Ali by invoking the name of Baron Salomon Mayer von Rothschild of Vienna. Muhammad Ali was hopeful that by giving his permission to rebuild the Ruin, Rothschild would be inclined to forge financial and political ties with him, which would in turn secure political support of Austria and France. In fact, Rothschild&#x27;s involvement was a ruse. As soon as Zoref received the &quot;firman&quot;, he contacted Zvi Hirsch Lehren of the Clerks&#x27; Organisation in Amsterdam, requesting that funds his brother had pledged towards the building of synagogues in Palestine be applied to the Ruin. But Lehren had doubts as to what exactly the &quot;firman&quot; permitted. Explicit authorisation for construction of a large synagogue was absent. (A letter from the leaders of the Amsterdam community to Moses Montefiore in 1849 confirms that permission for a synagogue in the Ashkenasic Compound had not been sanctioned; they had only been allowed to build dwellings in the area.)

====Menachem Zion Synagogue====
In spite of the doubts highlighted in relation to the construction of a synagogue, the Perushim, confidently in possession of the ambiguous &quot;firman&quot;, began clearing away the rubble from the Ruin courtyard in September 1836. As the foundations of he-Hasid&#x27;s original synagogue were revealed, they discovered a few old documents dating from 1579, signed by Israel ben Moses Najara. After much debate, they decided not to rebuild the Ruin, but initially erect a small structure on the edge of the Ashkenasic compound. The Arab creditors, however, still refused to relinquish the claims they had on the Jews and continued to interfere with the works. Zoref, claiming that the Ashkenazim currently in Jerusalem were not related in any way to those who had borrowed the money at the turn of the 18th century, was forced to appear in court requesting a further ruling cancelling the debts. He mentioned that an injunction had already been passed that absolved the Ashkenazim from repaying the debt and maintained that the Turkish Statute of Limitations cancelled out the debts of Judah heHasid&#x27;s followers. Although the court ruled in the Ashkenazim&#x27;s favour, Zoref nevertheless had to appease the Arab instigators with annual bribes in order to allow building to continue. At some point this arrangement ceased and in 1851, he was struck on the head with a sword and died of his wounds three months later. By January 1837 however, the Perushim had dedicated the modest Menachem Zion Synagogue in the northwestern corner of the courtyard. In 1854, a second smaller synagogue was built within the compound. The actual plot upon which he-Hasid&#x27;s synagogue had stood 130 years earlier, however, remained in ruins.

===Rebuilding he-Hasid&#x27;s Ruin: 1857–1864===
In the early 1850s, the Perushim felt ready to attempt the building a larger synagogue on he-Hasid&#x27;s original site. An outcome of the Crimean War was the British government&#x27;s willingness to use its increased influence at Constantinople to intervene on behalf of its Jewish subjects who resided in Jerusalem. On July 13, 1854, James Finn of the British consulate in Jerusalem wrote to the British ambassador in Constantinople describing the wishes of the 2,000 strong Ashkenazic community to build a new synagogue. He noted that funds for construction had been collected by Moses Montefiore twelve years earlier. He also enclosed a 150-year-old &quot;firman&quot;, which authorised the Ashkenazic Jews to rebuild their ruined synagogue. As the title to the plot of land was held by the Amzalag family, who were British subjects, they designated London-born Rabbi Hirschell, son of Chief Rabbi of Great Britain Solomon Hirschell, to negotiate the transfer. The British consulate agreed to lend its sanction to the contract in order to avoid possible intrusion by the Turks. At issue was the question of whether the building of a synagogue at the site constituted the repair of an old house of non-Muslim worship or the establishment of a new synagogue. The Turks would have to grant a special license for the latter. This was received through the efforts of Francis Napier and Stratford Canning, 1st Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe, British ambassadors to the Sublime Porte, who secured the necessary &quot;firman&quot; in 1854. In July 1855, while in Constantinople, Montefiore was handed the &quot;firman&quot;, which he hand-delivered during his fourth visit to Jerusalem in 1857.

With permission granted, the groundbreaking ceremony took place on the last day of Hanukkah of 1855. On April 22, 1856, the cornerstone was laid in the presence of Chief Rabbi of Jerusalem, Shmuel Salant. Salant had been instrumental in raising the necessary funding, making a trip to Europe in 1860 and obtaining large donations, especially from Montefiore. Some of the stones used in construction of the building was purchased from the Industrial Plantation, where poor Jews assisted in quarrying and shaping the blocks. On May 7, 1856 Consul Finn inspected the site after receiving complaints from Muslims who suspected the opening of windows towards a mosque.

Although originally in possession of a lump sum they hoped would pay for the planned edifice, expenses increased. Construction work progressed slowly for lack of funds and the impoverished community soon found themselves having to arrange collections throughout the diaspora. One notable emissary, Jacob Saphir, set off for Egypt in 1857 and returned in 1863 having visited Yemen, Aden, India, Java, Australia, New Zealand and Ceylon. The largest single gift came from Ezekiel Reuben, a wealthy Sephardi Jew from Baghdad, who gave 100,000 of the million piasters needed. His sons, Menashe and Sasson, later supplemented his donation. The combined donations from the Reuben family eventually covered more than half the cost. It marked an important step in the unity of the Sephardic and Ashkenazic communities of the city. Another contributor was Frederick William IV of Prussia, whose name was inscribed above the entrance together with those of other benefactors. He also gave permission for funds to be collected from his Jewish subjects. Throughout Western Europe, emissaries sought donations with the slogan &quot;Merit Eternal Life with one stone&quot;.

With new funds arriving, work could progress. In 1862 the domed ceiling was completed and Rabbi Yeshaya Bardaki, head of the Ashkenazic community, was honored with placing the final stone of the dome. Two years later in 1864, the new synagogue was dedicated. Present was Baron Alphonse James de Rothschild, who 8 years earlier had been given the honour of laying the first stone. The edifice was officially named &quot;Beis Yaakov&quot; – &quot;House of Jacob&quot; – in memory of James Mayer de Rothschild, whose son Edmond James de Rothschild had dedicated much of his life supporting the Jews of Palestine. The locals, however, continued to refer to the building as the Hurva. As a token of gratitude to the British government for their involvement, the British Consul James Finn, was invited to the dedication ceremony, which included a thanksgiving service. He described the &quot;beautiful chants and anthems in Hebrew&quot;, the subsequent refreshments provided and the playing of Russian and Austrian music.

====Structure====
The Hurva Synagogue was designed and constructed under the supervision of Assad Effendi, the sultan&#x27;s official architect. Built in Byzantine Revival style, it was supported by four massive pilasters at each corner over which soared a large dome. The construction of only one of these towers was completed. The other three were missing the upper level and the small dome that capped it. The facade was covered in finely hewn stone and incorporated high window arches. The height of the synagogue to the bottom of its dome was around and to the top of the dome it was . Twelve windows were placed around the base of the dome, which was surrounded by a veranda, which offered a fine view of large parts of the Old City and the area around Jerusalem. Being one of the tallest structures in the Old City, it was visible for miles.

====Interior====
The synagogue prayer hall was reached via an entrance with three iron gates. The length was around and the width was around . The women&#x27;s section was in the galleries, along the three sides of the chapel, except the eastern side. Access to the galleries was through towers situated at the corners of the building.

The Torah ark had the capacity to house 50 Torah scrolls and was built on two levels. It was flanked by four Corinthian columns surrounded by baroque woodcuts depicting flowers and birds. The Ark, together with its ornamental gates, were taken from the Nikolayevsky Synagogue in Kherson, Russia, which had been used by Russian Jewish conscripts forced to spend twenty-five years in the Imperial Russian Army. Directly above the Ark was a triangular window with rounded points. To the right and in front of the ark was the cantor&#x27;s podium, which was designed as a miniature version of the two-level Ark.

The centre of the synagogue originally contained a high wooden bimah, but this was later replaced with a flat platform covered with expensive marble plates.

Numerous crystal chandeliers hung from the dome. The dome itself was painted sky-blue and strewn with golden stars. Frescoes with religious motifs, such as stars of David, the menorah, Mount Sinai and the Ten Commandments, adorned every wall. In the four corners were drawings of four animals in accordance with the statement in &quot;Pirkei Avot&quot;: &quot;Be strong as the leopard and swift as the eagle, fleet as the deer and brave as the lion to do the will of your Father in Heaven.&quot;

One of the most generous donations came from Pinchas Rosenberg, the Imperial Court tailor of Saint Petersburg. In the diary of Rabbi Chaim ha-Levy, the emissary who had been sent from Jerusalem to collect funds for the synagogue, Rosenberg set out in details what his money was intended for. Among the items that were bought with his money were two big bronze candelabras; a silver menorah that &quot;arrived miraculously on the 1st &quot;Tevet&quot; [1866] precisely in time to light the last eight Hanukah candles&quot; and an iron door made under the holy ark for safe-keeping of the candlestick. He also earmarked funds towards the building of an &quot;artistically wrought iron fence around the roof under the upper windows so that there be a veranda on which may stand all our brethren who go up in pilgrimage to behold our desolate Temple, and also a partition for the womenfolk on the Feast of Tabernacles and Simchat Torah&quot;.

===Golden years: 1864–1948===

From 1864 onwards, the Hurva Synagogue was considered the most beautiful and most important synagogue in the Land of Israel. It was described as &quot;the glory of the Old City&quot; and the &quot;most striking edifice in all of Palestine&quot;. It also housed part of the Etz Chaim Yeshiva, the largest yeshiva in Jerusalem. It was a focal point of Jewish spiritual life in the city and was the site of the installation of the Ashkenazic chief rabbis of both Palestine and Jerusalem. On his visit to Jerusalem in 1866, Moses Montefiore went to the synagogue, placing a silver breastplate on one of the Torah scrolls. When he visited again in 1875, a crowd of 3,000 Jews turned out to greet him. On February 3, 1901 a memorial service for Queen Victoria took place inside the synagogue in gratitude for the protection afforded to the Jews of Jerusalem by Britain. The service was presided over by the Ashkenazic Chief Rabbi, Shmuel Salant. According to a report in &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot;, the large building was &quot;filled to its utmost capacity and policemen had to keep off the crowds, who vainly sought admission, by force&quot;. In around 1919, Benjamin Lee Gordon wrote that the &quot;synagogue presented a very pleasant and dignified appearance. It was well illuminated with artistic lamps presented by a certain Mr. Lichtenstein, of Philadelphia&quot;. In 1921 Abraham Isaac Kook was appointed first Chief Rabbi of Palestine at the synagogue. The synagogue also hosted Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel, who was honoured with reciting a portion of the Torah. In 1923 Yosef Shalom Eliashiv&#x27;s bar mitzvah was held at the synagogue. In the 1930s and possibly earlier, the synagogue housed the Chayei Olam Cheider, where indigent students form the Old City received their Torah education.

===Destruction during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War===
On May 25, 1948, during the battle for the Old City, commander of the Jordanian Arab Legion, Major Abdullah el-Tell, wrote to Otto Lehner of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement to warn that unless the armed Zionist forces (including the Haganah) withdrew from the synagogue and its adjoining courtyard, the Arab Legion would be forced to attack it. Moshe Russnak, commander of the Haganah in the Old City, ignored his request, knowing that if the Hurva fell, the battle for the Jewish Quarter would soon be lost. On May 26, 1948, the Jordanian Arab Legion delivered an ultimatum to the Jews to surrender within 12 hours; otherwise the Hurva would be bombarded.

On May 27, el-Tell, after receiving no answer to his proposition, told his men to &quot;Get the Hurva Synagogue by noon.&quot; Fawzi el-Kutub executed the mission by placing a 200-litre barrel filled with explosives against the synagogue wall. The explosion resulted in a gaping hole and Haganah fighters spent forty-five minutes fighting in vain to prevent the Legionnaires from entering. When they finally burst through, they tried to reach the top of its dome to plant an Arab flag. Three were shot by snipers, but the fourth succeeded. The Arab flag flying over the Old City skyline signaled the Legion&#x27;s triumph. Photographs show that the dome of the synagogue was badly damaged during the fighting. 

After taking the synagogue, Israeli sources state the Arab Legion blew up what remained: a huge explosion reduced the 84-year-old synagogue, together with the Etz Chaim Yeshiva attached to it, to rubble. Meanwhile Arab sources state the synagogue was destroyed as its rooftops were used militarily by Jewish armed groups. The Jewish defenders of the Old City surrendered the following day.

===Post-1967: Plans sought for a new design===

Following the Six-Day War, plans were mooted and designs sought for a new synagogue to be built at the site, part of the overall rehabilitation of the Jewish Quarter. Many religious and political figures supported the proposal to rebuild the original synagogue &quot;where it was, as it was&quot; in line with the traditional religious character of the area. However, the Jewish Quarter Development Company, in charge of the restoration of the Jewish Quarter, strongly opposed it. The Israeli planners and architects involved in developing the area wanted the building to reflect their modern Western identity. Additionally, although it would have been possible to rebuild it as it was, neither the architects nor the masons felt they were sufficiently qualified in traditional masonry technology to attempt it. Moreover, most of the original carved stones and surviving decorative elements had been removed, making a true &quot;reconstruction&quot; unrealisable. Swayed by the creativity of contemporary architecture and contrary to the 19th century design, which was meant to blend in with the Oriental landscape, they supported the modern redesign of the Hurva by a prominent architect.

====Kahn plans====

Leading the campaign to rebuild the Hurva was Shlomo Zalman Tzoref&#x27;s great-great-grandson, Ya&#x27;acov Salomon. He consulted Ram Karmi, who in turn recommended Louis Kahn, a world-renowned architect who was also a founding member of the Jerusalem Committee. Kahn had also previously designed Philadelphia&#x27;s Mikveh Israel Synagogue in 1961 which remained unbuilt. Between 1968 and 1973, Kahn presented three plans for the reconstruction. The ruins were incorporated in a memorial garden, with a new structure on an adjacent lot and a promenade, the &quot;Route of the Prophets&quot;, leading to the Western Wall.

Kahn proposed a structure within a structure, monumental &quot;pylons of Jerusalem stone on each side enclosing four huge central pillars of reinforced concrete, so that the pylons function[ed] as a container and the pillars as its content&quot;. Following the Beaux-Arts tradition, the elements of architecture were conceived as hollow, thus creating pocketing spaces within both structures. The outer structure was composed of 16 piers covered in golden Jerusalem stone cut in blocks of the same proportions and same course finish as those of the Western Wall. In the bases of the four corners of the two-story, high structure delineated by the piers, there would be small alcoves for meditation or individual prayer. Such alcoves would be used for daily prayer services, allowing larger crowds on Sabbath or festivals. Boston-based Israeli-Canadian architect Moshe Safdie, who had built extensively in Jerusalem and trained with Kahn in Philadelphia, was also in favour of rebuilding using contemporary design: &quot;It&#x27;s absurd to reconstruct the Hurva as if nothing had happened. If we have the desire to rebuild it, let&#x27;s have the courage to have a great architect do it.&quot;

When Teddy Kollek, then mayor of Jerusalem, had learned of Kahn&#x27;s plans to design the Hurva at a scale comparable to the Dome of the Rock and the Kotel, the mayor was unsupportive and stated: &quot;Should we in the Jewish Quarter have a building of major importance which &#x27;competes&#x27; with the Mosque and the Holy Sepulcher and should we in general have any building which would compete in importance with the Western Wall of the Temple?&quot; Kollek was also concerned with the impact such a monumental temple may have in the Old City. Kahn&#x27;s model was displayed in the Israel Museum, but his plan was shelved when he died in 1974. Kent Larson later referred to Kahn&#x27;s proposal as &quot;the greatest of the unbuilt&quot;.

===Commemorative arch and subsequent proposals===

As no permanent solution could be agreed upon, a temporary, symbolic solution was created. In 1977, one of the four stone arches that had originally supported the synagogue&#x27;s monumental dome was recreated. The height of the original building, including the dome, had been 50% greater than that of the new commemorative arch, which stood high. Together with the remains of the building and explanatory plaques, it was a stark reminder of what had once stood at the site. In 1996, the Hurva rebuilt arch was compared with the ecclesiastical allegory known as &quot;Synagoga&quot;, a medieval personification of the &quot;Synagogue&quot;, with attributes suggesting her ruined condition.

With the ongoing disputes over the modern façade of the proposed new building, which some felt did not properly match the Jewish Quarter&#x27;s aesthetic, an Englishman named Charles Clore took the initiative to fund a new design projects. He commissioned Denys Lasdun, who drew up plans between 1978 and 1981 that more closely adhered to the original Hurva. His plans were still considered insufficient, as they were rejected by Prime Minister Menachem Begin and the Minister of Interior, who refused to sign papers enabling construction to begin. No further progress was made and when Clore, who had wished to see the synagogue completed in his lifetime, died, his daughter provided funds to create one of the few open spaces in the Jewish Quarter adjacent to the Hurva.

The Hurva featured on a NIS 3.60 Israeli postage stamp in 1993 to commemorate 45 years of Israeli independence, and its arch on a $1.20 Antiguan postage stamp in 1996. However, in 1996, the supposedly temporary arch of the Hurva was almost thirty years old and, as a solution, it became nearly perpetual. Such condition was then publicly noted and interpreted:

This suggested that the single reconstructed arch of the Hurva could no longer be understood as a satisfactory expression of any commitment to rebuild the lost synagogue nor as an acceptable official response to its intentional destruction in 1948.

===Reconstruction (2005–2010)===

The plan to rebuild the synagogue in its original 19th-century style received approval by the Israeli government in 2000. Jerusalem architect Nahum Meltzer, who proposed rebuilding the synagogue in its original Ottoman format, was given the commission. Meltzer stated that &quot;both out of respect for the historical memory of the Jewish people and out of respect for the built-up area of the Old City, it is fitting for us to restore the lost glory and rebuild the Hurva Synagogue the way it was.&quot; The state-funded Jewish Quarter Development Corporation under the leadership of Dov Kalmanovich convinced the Israeli government to allocate $6.2 million (NIS 24m), about 85% of the cost, for the reconstruction, with private donors contributing the remainder. In the end, the government only gave NIS 11m, with the remainder being donated by a Ukrainian Jewish businessman and politician, Vadim Rabinovitch.

In 2002 the Israeli mint issued a set of medals featuring the synagogue to mark the beginning of the reconstruction project. Following comprehensive historic research, the reconstruction works began in 2005 and on February 15, 2007, Simcha HaKohen Kook of Rehovot was appointed as its rabbi, a move confirmed by leading rabbis, including Yosef Shalom Eliashiv. On April 15, 2008 a celebration marked the placing of the keystone in the synagogue&#x27;s dome. Following Simcha HaKohen Kook&#x27;s death, Rabbi Eliyahu Zilberman, rosh yeshiva of Yeshivat Aderet Eliyahu, was appointed rabbi of the synagogue.

Contention arose over what kind of institution the Hurva would be. A group of Secularist and nationalist-religious activists opposed the notion of another synagogue in the Old City and wanted the site to become a museum presenting the historical saga of the Jewish Quarter and displaying archaeological finds unearthed there. They viewed the appointment of Kook as the rabbi while the structure was still a shell as a move aimed at preventing a Modern Orthodox rabbi, who would have been more amenable to a broader utilisation of the site, from getting the position. Rabbi of the Jewish Quarter, Avigdor Nebenzahl, has been clear that he wants the building to serve as a synagogue and a house of study.

==Rededication and response==
The reconstructed Hurva was officially opened on March 15, 2010 in the presence of Israeli politicians and chief rabbis. A day earlier, hundreds of people had accompanied a new Torah scroll into the synagogue. Several Palestinian leaders claimed that the rededication signaled Israel&#x27;s intent to destroy the Muslim holy places on the Temple Mount and replace it with the Third Temple. Fatah official Khatem Abd el-Khader called the renovation of the Hurva a &quot;provocation&quot;, warned Israel that it was &quot;playing with fire&quot; and called on Palestinians to &quot;converge on Al-Aksa to save it&quot;. Khaled Mashal of Hamas described the synagogue&#x27;s opening as &quot;a declaration of war&quot; and called it a &quot;falsification of history and Jerusalem&#x27;s religious and historic monuments&quot;. Fearing riots by Arab protestors, over 3,000 policemen were deployed ahead of the dedication ceremony. The Organisation of the Islamic Conference said that the reopening risked &quot;dragging the region into a religious war&quot; and claimed the building was historically on a &quot;waqf&quot; (Islamic trust) land. The Jordanian government also condemned the move stating that it &quot;categorically rejects the rededication of Hurva synagogue and all other unilateral Israeli measures in occupied East Jerusalem because they run counter to international legitimacy&quot;. Iran&#x27;s Foreign Ministry urged the international community to respond to the reopening calling the move a &quot;catastrophe that has distressed the Islamic world&quot;. Israeli officials countered that Arab fears of a takeover of the Temple Mount were based on rumors and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu extended a message of coexistence. The U.S. State Department criticised Palestinians for stoking tensions at the rededication of the historic synagogue. The day after, Arabs clashed with Israeli police in East Jerusalem after Palestinian groups called for a &quot;day of rage&quot; over the reopening.

In September 2010, Hamas released a propaganda video showing various Israeli landmarks, including the Hurva synagogue, ablaze after coming under missile attack. The images were the result of special effects, as no such attacks had taken place.

==Cultural depictions==
* The Hurva Synagogue, as an emblem of Jerusalem and its Jewish heritage, has been portrayed over the years in numerous paintings, and referred to in literature and culture. The synagogue was portrayed, for example, in works by artists Yossef Gaiger, Jonathan Kis-Lev, and in the works of Holocaust survivor, artist Motke Blum. For decades, the synagogue&#x27;s arch has been the emblem of the Jewish quarter in the works of artists portraying the old city.
* Computer graphic reconstructions of Louis Kahn&#x27;s unbuilt project were made by Kent Larson (MIT, early 1990s), and further developed in terms of animation by Francesco Cerbella &amp; Federico Caponi (University of Florence, November 2013).

<text>The was a titular post held by a member of the Hōjō clan, officially a regent of the shogunate, from 1199 to 1333, during the Kamakura period, and so he was head of the &quot;bakufu&quot; (shogun&#x27;s government). It was part of the era referred to as .

During roughly the first half of that period, the &quot;shikken&quot; was the &quot;de facto&quot; military dictator of Japan (not including the independent Northern Fujiwara). The title of &quot;shikken&quot; was modified, as second in command to the &quot;Tokusō&quot; in 1256, but by the Muromachi period (1333–1573) the position, though not abolished, did not even figure in the top ranks. The position ceased to exist after the Muromachi period.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;shikken&quot; is the on&#x27;yomi reading of the combination of the two kanji characters and , each meaning &quot;to hold (something in the hand, or a service or ceremony); to administer&quot;, &quot;power, authority&quot; respectively. Therefore, the word literally means &quot;to hold power/authority&quot;.

==History==

===&quot;Shikken&quot; as supreme ruler (1199–1256)===
Though officially a regent for the &quot;shōgun&quot; in the Kamakura shogunate in Japan, on paper a &quot;shikken&quot; derived power from the &quot;shōgun&quot;, in reality the &quot;shōgun&quot; had been reduced to a figurehead in a similar marginalizing manner to how the emperor and imperial court had been reduced to figureheads by the first shōgun Minamoto no Yoritomo. Both the posts of &quot;shikken&quot; and &quot;tokusō&quot; were monopolized by the Hōjō clan.

Hōjō Tokimasa, was the father-in-law of Yoritomo through his wife Hōjō Masako, and became the first &quot;shikken&quot; in 1203, after Yoritomo&#x27;s death. The &quot;shikken&quot; was the chief of the &quot;mandokoro&quot; at that time. Tokimasa became the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of the shōgunate by monopolizing decisions for the young shōguns Yoriie and Sanetomo who were the sons of Yoritomo and Masako and thus Tokimasa&#x27;s maternal grandchildren, executing whoever got in his way, family or not. Tokimasa&#x27;s grandson Yoriie and great-grandson were murdered on Tokimasa&#x27;s orders, a year after he replaced the more independent Yoriie with his younger brother Sanetomo as shōgun.

Tokimasa&#x27;s son Yoshitoki strengthened the position of &quot;shikken&quot; by integrating it with the post of Samurai-dokoro, after annihilating the powerful Wada clan, who had dominated the latter position. The &quot;shikken&quot; became the highest post, controlling puppet &quot;shōguns&quot; in practice. In 1224, Yoshitoki&#x27;s son Hōjō Yasutoki set up the position of &quot;rensho&quot; (cosigner), or assistant regent.

===&quot;Shikken&quot; as &quot;tokusō&quot; subordinate (1256–1333)===
Hōjō Tokiyori separated the two posts of &quot;tokusō&quot; (initially head of the Hōjō clan) and &quot;shikken&quot; in 1256. He installed Hōjō Nagatoki as &quot;shikken&quot; while designating his son Tokimune to succeed as &quot;tokusō&quot;. Effective power was moved from &quot;shikken&quot; to &quot;tokusō&quot;. Tokimune, contemporaneous with Mongol invasions of Japan, at one point personally occupied all 3 most powerful posts of the shogunate, and thus Japan: &quot;tokusō&quot;, &quot;shikken&quot;, and &quot;rensho&quot;.

<doc id="411035" wikidata="Q5662887" url="?curid=411035" title="Harold von Braunhut">
<text>Harold Nathan Braunhut (March 31, 1926 – November 28, 2003), also known as Harold von Braunhut, was an American mail-order marketer and inventor most famous as the creator and seller of both the Amazing Sea-Monkeys and the X-ray specs, along with many other novelty products marketed towards children, often advertised in comic books. Von Braunhut also gained notoriety for his racial and political views. Despite his Jewish upbringing, he closely associated with white supremacist groups, including the Ku Klux Klan and the Aryan Nations organization.

==Early life==
Braunhut was born in Memphis, Tennessee, on March 31, 1926, to Jeanette (née Cohen), whose family was in the toy business, and Edward Braunhut, owner of a printing shop. His grandfather, Tobias Cohn, was head of the T. Cohn Superior Toy Company, which he founded in 1900, until 1968, when he filed for bankruptcy and the company was purchased by Brumberger Inc. He grew up in New York City and resided there until the 1980s, when he moved to Maryland. According to a report in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, he was raised &quot;as Harold Nathan Braunhut, a Jew&quot;, and had a religious upringing — notable in light of his later association with white supremacist groups. He added &quot;von&quot; to his name some time in the 1950s for a more Germanic sound and so he could distance himself from his Jewish family. 

==Business activities==
Braunhut used comic book advertisements to sell an assortment of products, many of which were misleadingly advertised. He held 195 patents for various products, many of which have become cultural icons, including:
* X-ray specs, which advertisements claimed enabled the wearer to see through clothing and flesh. The product has appealed to generations of curious pre-adolescents.
* Amazing Sea-Monkeys, which were tiny brine shrimp eggs that &quot;came to life&quot; when water was added. Sales took an upswing when comic book illustrator Joe Orlando drew comic book advertisements showing the humanized Sea-Monkeys enjoying life in their underwater fantasy world. Billions of the tiny creatures have been sold over the years and have generated fan websites, a television series, and a video game. Astronaut John Glenn took 400 million &quot;Amazing Sea-Monkeys&quot; into space with him in 1998.
* Crazy Crabs, which were simply hermit crabs in a box. 
* Amazing Hair-Raising Monsters, a card with a printed monster that would grow &quot;hair&quot; (actually grass) when water was added.
* Invisible Goldfish, imaginary fish sold with a handbook, fish food and a glass bowl, that were guaranteed to remain permanently invisible.

Braunhut also raced motorcycles under the name &quot;The Green Hornet&quot; and managed a showman (Henry Lamore or Henri LaMothe) whose act consisted of diving into a children&#x27;s wading pool filled with only of water, and the mentalist The Amazing Dunninger. Braunhut also set up a wildlife conservation area in Maryland.

==Racial views==
&quot;The Washington Post&quot; stated in a report that, despite his Jewish ethnicity, he had a close association with white supremacist groups, buying firearms for a Ku Klux Klan faction and regularly attending the Aryan Nations annual conference. “Hendrik von Braun&quot; operated an organization calling itself the &quot;National Anti-Zionist Institute&quot; from the same Bryans Road, Maryland address that von Braunhut used to sell Sea Monkey merchandise. In 1988, he was listed among a group of &quot;outstanding Aryan nationalist leaders&quot; at an Aryan Nations congress.

In a 1988 interview with &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;, he referred to the &quot;inscrutable, slanty Korean eyes&quot; of Korean shop owners and was quoted as saying, &quot;You know what side I&#x27;m on. I don&#x27;t make any bones about it.&quot;

==Personal life==
Von Braunhut first married Charlotte Braunhut. His second marriage was to actress Yolanda Signorelli, who took an active role in marketing Sea-Monkeys. They had a son, Jonathan, and a daughter, Jeanette LaMothe.

Harold von Braunhut died on November 28, 2003, at his home in Indian Head, Maryland.

<text>Many musical styles flourished and combined in the 1940s and 1950s, most likely because of the influence the radio had in creating a mass market for music. World War II caused great social upheaval, and the music of this period shows the effects of that upheaval.

==Classic pop==

Popular music, or &quot;classic pop,&quot; dominated the charts for the first half of the 1950s. Vocal-driven classic pop replaced Big Band/Swing at the end of World War II, although it often used orchestras to back the vocalists. 1940s style Crooners vied with a new generation of big voiced singers, many drawing on Italian bel canto traditions. Mitch Miller, A&amp;R man at the era&#x27;s most successful label, Columbia Records, set the tone for the development of popular music well into the middle of decade. Miller integrated country, Western, rhythm &amp; blues, and folk music into the musical mainstream, by having many of his label&#x27;s biggest artists record them in a style that corresponded to Pop traditions. Miller often employed novel and ear-catching arrangements featuring classical instruments (whooping french horns, harpsichord), or sound effects (whip cracks). He approached each record as a miniature story, often &quot;casting&quot; the vocalist according to type. 
&quot;(Mitch) Miller and the producers who followed his model were creating a new sort of pop record. Instead of capturing the sound of live groups, they were making three-minute musicals, matching singers to songs in the same way that movie producers matched stars to film roles. As Miller told &#x27;Time&#x27; magazine in 1951, &#x27;Every singer has certain sounds he makes better than others. Frankie Laine is sweat and hard words - he&#x27;s a guy beating the pillow, a purveyor of basic emotions. Guy Mitchell is better with happy-go-lucky songs; he&#x27;s a virile young singer, gives people a vicarious lift. Rosemary Clooney is a barrelhouse dame, a hillbilly at heart.&#x27; It was a way of thinking perfectly suited to the new market in which vocalists were creating unique identities and hit songs were performed as television skits.&quot;
Whereas Big Band/Swing music placed the primary emphasis on the orchestration, post-war/early 1950s era Pop focused on the song&#x27;s story and/or the emotion being expressed. By the early 1950s, emotional delivery had reached its apex in the miniature psycho-drama songs of writer-singer Johnnie Ray. Known as &#x27;The Cry Guy&#x27; and &#x27;The Prince of Wails,&#x27; Ray&#x27;s on-stage emotion wrought &#x27;breakdowns&#x27; provided a release for the pent-up angst of his predominantly teenaged fans. As Ray described it, &quot;I make them feel, I exhaust them, I destroy them.&#x27; It was during this period that the fan hysteria, which began with Frank Sinatra during the Second World War, really began to take hold.

Although often ignored by musical historians, Pop music played a significant role in the development of Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll as well:

 &quot;[Mitch] Miller also conceived of the idea of the pop record &#x27;sound&#x27; per se: not so much an arrangement or a tune, but an aural texture (usually replete with extramusical gimmicks) that could be created in the studio and then replicated in live performance, instead of the other way around. Miller was hardly a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roller, yet without these ideas there could never have been rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll. &#x27;Mule Train&#x27;, Miller&#x27;s first major hit (for Frankie Laine) and the foundation of his career, set the pattern for virtually the entire first decade of rock. The similarities between it and, say, &#x27;Leader of the Pack,&#x27; need hardly be outlined here.&quot;

Patti Page kicked things off with what would become the decade&#x27;s biggest hit, &quot;Tennessee Waltz.&quot; Her other hits from this period included: &quot;Mister and Mississippi,&quot; &quot;Mockin&#x27; Bird Hill,&quot; &quot;Detour,&quot; &quot;(How Much Is That) Doggie in the Window,&quot; and &quot;Old Cape Cod.&quot; Frankie Laine&#x27;s 1949 hits, &quot;That Lucky Old Sun (Just Rolls Around Heaven All Day)&quot; and &quot;Mule Train,&quot; were still riding high on the charts when the decade began. He continued to score with such hits as: &quot;Georgia On My Mind,&quot; &quot;Cry of the Wild Goose,&quot; &quot;Jezebel,&quot; &quot;Rose, Rose, I Love You,&quot; &quot;Jealousy (Jalousie),&quot; &quot;High Noon (Do Not Forsake Me),&quot; &quot;I Believe,&quot; &quot;Granada,&quot; &quot;Moonlight Gambler,&quot; and &quot;Rawhide.&quot; Johnnie Ray had a long run of hits in the early half of the decade, often backed by The Four Lads, including: &quot;Cry,&quot; &quot;The Little White Cloud That Cried,&quot; &quot;Walking My Baby Back Home,&quot; &quot;Please, Mr. Sun,&quot; and &quot;Just Walkin&#x27; in the Rain.&quot; The Four Lads racked up some hits on their own with &quot;Who Needs You,&quot; &quot;No, Not Much,&quot; &quot;Standin&#x27; on the Corner,&quot; and &quot;Moments to Remember.&quot; Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole dominated the charts throughout the decade with such timeless classics as &quot;Unforgettable,&quot; &quot;Mona Lisa,&quot; &quot;Too Young,&quot; &quot;Darling, Je Vous Aime Beaucoup,&quot; &quot;Pretend,&quot; &quot;Smile,&quot; and &quot;A Blossom Fell.&quot; Perry Como was another frequent visitor to the charts with hits like: &quot;If,&quot; &quot;Round and Round,&quot; &quot;Don&#x27;t Let the Stars Get in Your Eyes,&quot; &quot;Tina Marie,&quot; &quot;Papa Loves Mambo,&quot; and &quot;Catch a Falling Star.&quot;

Other major stars in the early 1950s included Frank Sinatra (&quot;Young at Heart,&quot; &quot;Three Coins in the Fountain,&quot; &quot;Witchcraft&quot;), Tony Bennett (&quot;Cold, Cold Heart,&quot; &quot;Because of You,&quot; &quot;Rags to Riches&quot;), Kay Starr (&quot;Bonaparte&#x27;s Retreat,&quot; &quot;Wheel of Fortune,&quot; &quot;Rock and Roll Waltz&quot;), Rosemary Clooney (&quot;Come On-a My House,&quot; &quot;Mambo Italiano,&quot; &quot;Half as Much,&quot; &quot;This Ole House&quot;), Dean Martin (&quot;That&#x27;s Amore,&quot; &quot;Return to Me,&quot; &quot;Sway&quot;), Georgia Gibbs (&quot;Kiss of Fire,&quot; &quot;Dance With Me, Henry,&quot; &quot;Tweedle Dee&quot;), Eddie Fisher (&quot;Anytime,&quot; &quot;Wish You Were Here,&quot; &quot;Thinking of You,&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m Walking Behind You,&quot; &quot;Oh! My Pa-Pa,&quot; &quot;Fanny&quot;), Teresa Brewer (&quot;Music! Music! Music!,&quot; &quot;Till I Waltz Again With You,&quot; &quot;Ricochet(Rick-O-Shay)&quot;), Doris Day (&quot;Secret Love,&quot; &quot;Whatever Will Be Will Be (Que Sera Sera),&quot; &quot;Teacher&#x27;s Pet&quot;), Guy Mitchell (&quot;My Heart Cries for You,&quot; &quot;The Roving Kind,&quot; &quot;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,&quot; &quot;Singing the Blues&quot;), Bing Crosby (&quot;Play a Simple Melody with son Gary Crosby, &quot;True Love with Grace Kelly), Dinah Shore (&quot;Lavender Blue&quot;), Kitty Kallen (&quot;Little Things Mean a Lot&quot;), Joni James (&quot;Have You Heard,&quot; &quot;Wishing Ring,&quot; &quot;Your Cheatin&#x27; Heart&quot;), Peggy Lee (&quot;Lover,&quot; &quot;Fever&quot;), Julie London (&quot;Cry Me a River&quot;), Toni Arden (&quot;Padre&quot;), June Valli (&quot;Why Don&#x27;t You Believe Me&quot;), Arthur Godfrey (&quot;Slowpoke&quot;), Tennessee Ernie Ford (&quot;Sixteen Tons&quot;), Les Paul and Mary Ford (&quot;Vaya Con Dios,&quot; &quot;Tiger Rag&quot;), and vocal groups like The Mills Brothers (&quot;Glow Worm&quot;), The Weavers &quot;(Goodnight Irene&quot;), The Four Aces (&quot;Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing&quot;, &quot;(It&#x27;s No) Sin&quot;), The Chordettes (&quot;Mister Sandman&quot;), Fontane Sisters (&quot;Hearts of Stone&quot;), The Hilltoppers (&quot;Trying,&quot; &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot;), The McGuire Sisters (&quot;Sincerely,&quot; &quot;Goodnite, Sweetheart, Goodnite,&quot; &quot;Sugartime&quot;) and The Ames Brothers (&quot;Ragmop&quot;, &quot;The Naughty Lady of Shady Lane&quot;).

Classic pop declined in popularity as rock and roll entered the mainstream and became a major force in American record sales. Crooners such as Eddie Fisher, Perry Como, and Patti Page, who had dominated the first half of the decade, found their access to the pop charts significantly curtailed by the decade&#x27;s end. However, new Pop vocalists continued to rise to prominence throughout the decade, many of whom started out singing Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll. These include: Pat Boone (&quot;Don&#x27;t Forbid Me,&quot; &quot;April Love,&quot; &quot;Love Letters in the Sand&quot;), Connie Francis (&quot;Who&#x27;s Sorry Now,&quot; &quot;Among My Souvenirs,&quot; &quot;My Happiness&quot;), Gogi Grant (&quot;Suddenly There&#x27;s a Valley,&quot; &quot;The Wayward Wind&quot;), Bobby Darin (&quot;Dream Lover,&quot; &quot;Beyond the Sea,&quot; &quot;Mack the Knife&quot;), and Andy Williams (&quot;Canadian Sunset,&quot; &quot;Butterfly,&quot; &quot;Hawaiian Wedding Song&quot;). Even Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll icon Elvis Presley spent the rest of his career alternating between Pop and Rock (&quot;Love Me Tender,&quot; &quot;Loving You,&quot; &quot;I Love You Because&quot;). Pop would resurface on the charts in the mid-1960s as &quot;Adult Contemporary.&quot;

== Rock and roll ==

Rock and roll dominated popular music in the latter half of the 1950s. The musical style originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, and quickly spread to much of the rest of the world. Its immediate origins lay in a mixing together of various black musical genres of the time, including rhythm and blues and gospel music; with country and western and Pop. In 1951, Cleveland, Ohio disc jockey Alan Freed began playing rhythm and blues music for a multi-racial audience, and is credited with first using the phrase &quot;rock and roll&quot; to describe the music, though the terms &quot;rocking&quot; and &quot;rolling&quot; were being used in boogie-woogie and religious music for decades before that.

The 1950s saw the growth in popularity of the electric guitar (developed and popularized by Les Paul). Paul&#x27;s hit records like &quot;How High the Moon,&quot; and &quot;The World Is Waiting for the Sunrise,&quot; helped lead to the development of a specifically rock and roll style of playing of such exponents as Chuck Berry, Link Wray, and Scotty Moore. Chuck Berry, who is considered to be one of the pioneers of Rock and roll music, refined and developed the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive, focusing on teen life and introducing guitar solos and showmanship that would be a major influence on subsequent rock music.

Artists such as Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Fats Domino, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, Big Joe Turner, and Gene Vincent released the initial rhythm and blues-influenced early rock and roll hits. Rock and roll forerunners in the popular music field included Johnnie Ray, The Crew-Cuts, The Fontane Sisters, and Les Paul and Mary Ford. The Rock and Roll Era is generally dated from the March 25, 1955 premiere of the motion picture, &quot;The Blackboard Jungle.&quot; This film&#x27;s use of Bill Haley and His Comets&#x27; &quot;(We&#x27;re Gonna) Rock Around the Clock&quot; over its opening credits, caused a national sensation when teenagers started dancing in the aisles.

Pat Boone became the first rock and roll teen idol in 1955 with heavily Pop-influenced &quot;covers&quot; of R&amp;B hits like &quot;Two Hearts, Two Kisses (Make One Love),&quot; &quot;Ain&#x27;t That a Shame&quot;, and &quot;At My Front Door (Crazy Little Mama).&quot; Boone&#x27;s traditional approach to rock and roll, coupled with his All-American, clean-cut image helped bring the new sound to a much wider audience. Elvis Presley, who began his career in the mid-1950s, soon became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll with a series of network television appearances, motion pictures, and chart-topping records. His energized interpretations of songs, many from African American sources, and his uninhibited performance style made him enormously popular—and controversial during that period. Boone and Presley&#x27;s styles/images represented opposite ends of the burgeoning musical form, which competed with one another throughout the remainder of the decade.

In 1957, a popular television show featuring rock and roll performers, American Bandstand, went national. Hosted by Dick Clark, the program helped to popularize the more clean-cut, All-American brand of rock and roll. By the end of the decade, teen idols like Bobby Darin, Ricky Nelson, Frankie Avalon, Paul Anka, Neil Sedaka, Bobby Rydell, Connie Francis, and Fabian Forte were topping the charts. Some commentators have perceived this as the decline of rock and roll; citing the deaths of Buddy Holly, The Big Bopper and Ritchie Valens in a tragic plane crash in 1959 and the departure of Elvis for the army as causes.

On the other side of the spectrum, R&amp;B-influenced acts like The Crows, The Penguins, The El Dorados and The Turbans all scored major hits, and groups like The Platters, with songs including &quot;The Great Pretender&quot; (1955), and The Coasters with humorous songs like &quot;Yakety Yak&quot; (1958), ranked among the most successful rock and roll acts of the period.

Rock and roll has also been seen as leading to a number of distinct subgenres, including rockabilly (see below) in the 1950s, combining rock and roll with &quot;hillbilly&quot; country music, which was usually played and recorded in the mid-1950s by white singers such as Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Buddy Holly and with the greatest commercial success, Elvis Presley. Another subgenre, Doo Wop, entered the pop charts in the 1950s . Its popularity soon spawns the parody &quot;Who Put the Bomp (in the Bomp, Bomp, Bomp).&quot;

Novelty songs, long a music industry staple, continued their popularity in the Rock and Roll medium with hits such as &quot;Beep Beep.&quot;

==Bluegrass==
In the late 1930s, Bill Monroe formed the Blue Grass Boys (named after his native state of Kentucky, the &quot;blue grass state&quot;) and combined diverse influences into Appalachian folk music. These include Scottish, Poland and Southeastern Europe and folk, as well as doo wop, country and gospel. Monroe became the father of bluegrass music, and his band was a training ground for most of bluegrass&#x27; future stars, especially Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs. Flatt and Scruggs popularized bluegrass as part of the Foggy Mountain Boys, which they formed in 1948. Though bluegrass has never quite achieved mainstream status, it did become well known through its use in several recorded plays, including the T.V. theme song for &quot;Beverly Hillbillies&quot; and the movies &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; and &quot;Deliverance&quot;. In the 1950s, bluegrass artists included Stanley Brothers, Osborne Brothers and Jimmy Martin&#x27;s Sunny Mountain Boys.

==Country music==
The 1950s also saw the popular dominance of the Nashville sound in country music. Country&#x27;s Nashville sound was slick and soulful, and a movement of rough honky tonk developed in a reaction against the mainstream orientation of Nashville. This movement was centered in Bakersfield, California with musicians like Buck Owens (&quot;Act Naturally&quot;), Merle Haggard (&quot;Sing a Sad Song&quot;) and Wynn Stewart (&quot;It&#x27;s Such a Pretty World Today&quot;) helping to define the sound among the community, made up primarily of Oklahoman immigrants to California, who had fled unemployment and drought.

==Folk music==

The late 1940s and the early 1950s saw the beginning of popular folk music with groups like The Weavers. The Kingston Trio, Pete Seeger, Woody Guthrie, Odetta, and several other performers were instrumental in launching the folk music revival of the 1950s and 1960s.

==Roots revival==
By the late 1950s, a revival of Appalachian folk music was taking place across the country, and bands like The Weavers were paving the way for future mainstream stars like Bob Dylan and Joan Baez. Bluegrass was similarly revitalized and updated by artists including Tony Rice, Clarence White, Richard Green, Bill Keith and David Grisman. The Dillards, however, were the ones to break bluegrass into mainstream markets in the early 1960s.

==Gospel==
Following World War II, gospel began its golden age. Artists like the Five Blind Boys of Mississippi, The Swan Silvertones, Clara Ward Singers and Sensational Nightingales became stars across the country; other early artists like Sam Cooke, Dionne Warwick, Dinah Washington, Johnnie Taylor, Aretha Franklin, Wilson Pickett began their career in gospel quartets during this period, only to achieve even greater fame in the 1960s as the pioneers of soul music, itself a secularized, R&amp;B-influenced form of gospel. Mahalia Jackson and The Staple Singers were undoubtedly the most successful of the golden age gospel artists.

==Doo wop==
In addition, doo wop achieved widespread popularity in the 1950s. Doo wop was a harmonically complex style of choral singing that developed in the streets of major cities like Chicago, New York City, and, most importantly, Baltimore. Doo wop singers would work a cappella without backing instruments, and practice in hallways of their schools, apartment buildings, or alleys to achieve echo effects on their voices, and lyrics were generally innocent youthful observations on the upsides of teen love and romance. Groups like The Crows (&quot;Gee&quot;), The Orioles (&quot;It&#x27;s Too Soon to Know&quot;) and Brooklyn&#x27;s Frankie Lymon &amp; the Teenagers (&quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot;) had a string of hit songs that brought the genre to chart domination by 1958 (see 1958 in music).

==Latin music==
Cuban mambo, cha-cha-chá and charanga bands enjoyed brief periods of popularity, and helped establish a viable Latin-American music industry, which led the way to the invention of salsa music among Cubans and Puerto Ricans in New York City in the 1970s. The 1950s also saw success for Mexican ranchera divas, while a Mexican-American mariachi scene was developing on the West Coast, and Puerto Rican plena, Brazilian bossa nova and other Latin genres became popular.

Mexican-Texans had been playing conjunto music for decades by the end of World War 2, female duos created the first popular style of Mexican-American music, norteña. Mexican romantic ballads called bolero were also popular, especially singers like the &quot;Queen of the Bolero&quot;, Chelo Silva. In the mid-1950s, when Mexican ranchera was used in Hollywood film soundtracks and the upper-class enjoyed stately orquestas Tejanas and conjunto evolved into a distinctively Mexican-American genre called Tejano. Artists of this era include Esteban Jordan, Tony de la Rosa and El Conjunto Bernal.

==Cajun and Creole music==
The 1940s saw a return to the roots of Cajun music, led by Iry LeJeune, Nathan Abshire and other artists, alongside musicians who incorporated rock and roll, including Laurence Walker and Aldus Roger. In the late 1940s, Clifton Chenier, a Creole, began playing an updated form of la la called zydeco. Zydeco was briefly popular among some mainstream listeners during the 1950s. Artists like Boozoo Chavis, Queen Ida, Rockin&#x27; Dopsie and Rockin&#x27; Sidney have continued to bring zydeco to national audiences in the following decades. Zydeco shows major influences from rock, and artists like Beau Jocque have combined other influences, including hip hop.

<text>[[Popular music]] of the United States in the 1970s saw various forms of pop music dominating the charts. Often characterized as being shallow, 1970s pop took many forms and could be seen as a reaction against the high-energy and activist pop of the previous decade. It began with singer-songwriters like Carole King and Carly Simon topping the charts, while New York City saw a period of great innovation; hip hop, punk rock and salsa were invented in 1970s New York, which was also a center for electronic music, techno.

By the middle of the decade, various trends were vying for popular success. Sly &amp; the Family Stone&#x27;s pop-funk had spawned singers like Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway, alongside George Clinton&#x27;s spacy P Funk extravaganzas, Lynyrd Skynyrd and the Allman Brothers Band led a wave of country rock bands. Pop progressive-hard rock bands like Boston, Kansas, Journey, and Styx had long-running popularity. Bruce Springsteen garnered critical acclaim during much of the decade, finally breaking through in a big way very late in the 1970s. Disco, especially The Bee Gees and Donna Summer, were dominating the charts the last few years of the decade, while punk rock and other genres were developing underground.

== Rock ==

===Hard rock, arena rock and heavy metal===
The 1970s saw the emergence of hard rock as one of the most prominent subgenres of rock music. Bands like Alice Cooper and Deep Purple were highly popular by 1972. The guitar sounds became heavier and the riffs faster. By the second half of the decade, several bands had achieved star status, namely, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Aerosmith and Kiss. 
Arena rock grew in popularity through progressive bands like Styx (&quot;Come Sail Away&quot;), and hard rock bands like Boston (&quot;More Than a Feeling&quot;).

Heavy metal music (though not recognized as a separate genre from hard rock at the time) gained a cult following in the 1970s, led by Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and Deep Purple, with their styles later influencing other bands like Judas Priest and Motörhead, which eventually started the New Wave of British Heavy Metal in the 1980s.

Psychedelic rock declined in popularity after the deaths of Jimi Hendrix and Jim Morrison and the breakup of The Beatles.

===Soft rock and singer-songwriter===

Soft rock was prominently featured on many Top 40 and contemporary hit radio stations throughout the 1970s. Soft rock often used acoustic instruments and placed emphasis on melody and harmonies. Major soft rock artists of the 1970s included Carole King, James Taylor, Billy Joel, Chicago, America and Fleetwood Mac, whose &quot;Rumours&quot; (1977) was the best selling album of the decade. (See the country music section of this article for more about country music that crossed over onto the pop charts.) Bob Dylan&#x27;s 1975–1976 Rolling Thunder Revue reunited him with a number of folk-rock acts from his early days of performing, most notably Joan Baez.

A large number of country-pop and soft rock songs fit into the singer-songwriter classification – that is, songs written and recorded by the same person. Some of the most successful singer-songwriter artists were Jackson Browne, Eric Carmen, Jim Croce, John Denver, Steve Goodman, Arlo Guthrie, Joel, Dave Mason, Don McLean, Joni Mitchell, Paul Simon, Taylor and Neil Young. Some artists – including King, Kris Kristofferson and Gordon Lightfoot — had previously been primarily songwriters but began releasing albums and songs of their own. King&#x27;s album &quot;Tapestry&quot; became one of the top-selling albums of the decade, and the song &quot;It&#x27;s Too Late&quot; became one of the 1970s biggest songs. McLean&#x27;s 1971 song &quot;American Pie,&quot; inspired by the death of Buddy Holly, became one of popular music&#x27;s most-recognized songs of the 20th century, thanks to its abstract and vivid storytelling, which center around &quot;The Day the Music Died&quot; and popular music of the rock era.

The early 1970s marked the departure of Diana Ross from The Supremes and the breakup of Simon &amp; Garfunkel. Ross, Simon and Art Garfunkel all continued hugely successful recording careers throughout the decade and beyond. Several of their songs are listed among the biggest hits of the 1970s: Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water,&quot; Simon&#x27;s solo hit &quot;50 Ways to Leave Your Lover,&quot; and Ross&#x27; &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Mountain High Enough.&quot;

=== Country rock and Southern rock ===

Country rock, formed from the fusion of rock music with country music, gained its greatest commercial success in the 1970s, beginning with non-country artists such as Bob Dylan, Gram Parsons and The Byrds. By the mid-1970s, Linda Ronstadt, along with other newer artists such as Emmylou Harris and The Eagles, were enjoying mainstream success and popularity that continues to this day. The Eagles themselves emerged as one of the most successful rock acts of all time, producing albums that included &quot;Hotel California&quot; (1976).

During the 1970s, a similar style of country rock called Southern rock (fusing rock, country and blues music, and focusing on electric guitars and vocals) was enjoying popularity with country audiences, thanks to such non-country acts as Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Allman Brothers Band, Atlanta Rhythm Section and The Marshall Tucker Band.

===Progressive rock===

The American brand of prog rock varied from the eclectic and innovative Frank Zappa, Captain Beefheart and Pavlov&#x27;s Dog to more pop arena rock bands like Boston, Kansas, Journey, TOTO and Styx. These, beside British bands Jethro Tull, Supertramp and Electric Light Orchestra, all demonstrated a prog rock influence and while ranking among the most commercially successful acts of the 1970s, issuing in the era of &quot;pomp&quot; or &quot;arena rock&quot;, which would last until the costs of complex shows (often with theatrical staging and special effects), would be replaced by more economical rock festivals as major live venues in the 1990s.

===New Wave===
Many American bands in the late seventies began experimenting with synthesizers, forming the new wave style. The original American bands included Talking Heads, The Cars, and Devo. In the eighties, Britain would respond with the synthpop style, which broadened the definition of &quot;new wave&quot;.

===Power pop===
Combining elements of punk rock and pop music, bands such as The Romantics, The Knack, and Cheap Trick created the &quot;power pop&quot; sound. Also seeing mild success is Loverboy.

===Blues rock===
Blues rock remains popular, with Johnnie Winter, ZZ Top, and George Thorogood and Eric Clapton(UK), seeing the greatest success.

==Disco==

For many people, disco is the genre of music most readily associated with the 1970s. First appearing in dance clubs by the middle of the decade, (with such hits as &quot;The Hustle&quot; by Van McCoy), artists like Donna Summer, Gloria Gaynor popularized the genre and were described in subsequent decades as the &quot;disco divas.&quot; The movie &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; was released in December 1977, starring John Travolta and featuring the music of the Bee Gees and several other artists. It had the effect of setting off disco mania in the United States. the Bee Gees&#x27; soundtrack to &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; became the one best selling album of all time. The Bee Gees and Donna Summer became the genres mega stars. The Bee Gees had 9 number 1 singles, and 12 top 10 hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Chart. Donna Summer had 4 number 1 singles, and 8 top 5 hits, 9 top 10s during the second half of the decade. Summer would be the first female artist of the modern era, to have the number one single and number album, simultaneously on the pop charts. She would accomplish this 3 times in 8 months. She was the first female artist to have 3 number one singles, and 5 top 10, and or; 5 top 5 singles in a calendar year (1979). The other prominent acts of the genre were KC and the Sunshine Band who scored 4 number one singles, The Village People, and Chic. KC and the Sunshine Band would enter the first week of the new decade (1980s) with their fifth number one single, and Donna Summer would enter the new decade with her third number one double album.

The genre started to become increasingly commercialized, and the large number of disco songs flooding the radio airwaves in 1978–1979 resulted in a growing backlash against it, as epitomized by the &quot;Disco Demolition Night&quot; stunt by a Chicago disc jockey at a July 1979 baseball game at Comiskey Park. The popularity of the genre waned, and 1980s, declared dead by the rock deejays of the nation, &quot;Funkytown&quot; by Lipps Inc. was one of the last disco hits. Along with the demise of disco came the end of the orchestrations and musical instruments (such as strings) which had become associated with disco, in part because of the high cost of producing such music. Electronic and synthesized music quickly replaced the lush orchestral sounds of the 1970s and rock music resurged in popularity with new wave bands such as Blondie (&quot;Heart of Glass&quot;), The Knack (&quot;My Sharona&quot;) and Devo (&quot;Whip It&quot;), all who formed their bands in the 1970s. Many artists such as The Bee Gees, who came to be associated with disco, found it difficult to get airplay on the radio.

==R&amp;B and urban==

Along with disco, funk was one of the most popular genres of music in the 1970s. Primarily an African-American genre, it was characterized by the heavy use of bass and &quot;wah-wah&quot; pedals. Rhythm was emphasized over melody. Artists such as James Brown, The Meters, Parliament-Funkadelic and Sly and the Family Stone pioneered the genre. It then spawned artists such as Stevie Wonder, The Brothers Johnson, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, Bootsy&#x27;s Rubber Band, King Floyd, Tower of Power, Ohio Players, The Commodores, War, Kool &amp; the Gang, Confunkshun, Slave, Cameo, the Bar-Kays, Zapp, and many more.

The Jackson 5 became one of the biggest pop-music phenomena of the 1970s, playing from a repertoire of rhythm and blues, soul, pop and later disco. The Jacksons include Jermaine and Michael, the first act in recording history to have their first four major label singles: &quot;I Want You Back&quot;, &quot;ABC&quot;, &quot;The Love You Save&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There&quot; reach the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The band served as the launching pad for the solo careers of their lead singers Jermaine and Michael, and while Jermaine had some success, it was Michael who would transform his early fame into greater success as an adult artist, with songs such as &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop &#x27;Til You Get Enough&quot; and &quot;Rock with You.&quot;

First album of The Commodores were funk song only, but later, they played pop songs. Lionel Richie changed his sound and got success as a solo singer. His group&#x27;s era he had big hits, including &quot;Easy,&quot; &quot;Three Times a Lady&quot; and &quot;Still.&quot;

==Pop==
Some of the notable pop groups during the 1970s were the Carpenters, the Jackson 5, Chicago, ABBA, the Bee Gees, Electric Light Orchestra, the Eagles and Fleetwood Mac.

Male soloists who characterized the pop music of the era included Barry Manilow, Paul McCartney, Elton John, Neil Diamond, Stevie Wonder and Rod Stewart. Female soloists who epitomized the 1970s included Roberta Flack, Carly Simon, Donna Summer, Barbra Streisand, Linda Ronstadt, Olivia Newton-John, Diana Ross, and Helen Reddy.

==Country==

A number of styles defined country music during the 1970s decade. At the beginning of the decade, the countrypolitan — an offshoot of the earlier &quot;Nashville Sound&quot; of the late 1950s and early 1960s – and the honky-tonk fused Bakersfield Sound were some of the more popular styles.

The countrypolitan sound – a polished, streamlined sound featuring string sections, background vocals and crooning lead vocalists – was popularized by artists including Lynn Anderson, Glen Campbell, Anne Murray, Dottie West, Tammy Wynette and others, achieving their successes through such songs as &quot;(I Never Promised You a) Rose Garden&quot;, &quot;Snowbird&quot; and others. The Bakersfield sound, first popularized in the early 1960s, continued its peak in popularity through artists such as Buck Owens and Merle Haggard.

But other styles began to emerge during the 1970s. One of the more successful styles was &quot;outlaw country&quot;, a type of music blending the traditional and honky tonk sounds of country music with rock and blues music, and mixed with the anger of an alienated subculture of the nation during the period. The leaders of the movement were Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson, although others associated with the movement were David Allan Coe, Jessi Colter, Tompall Glaser, Gary Stewart and Billy Joe Shaver. The efforts of Jennings, Nelson Colter and Glaser were encapsulated in the 1976 album &quot;Wanted! The Outlaws&quot;.

The country pop sound was a successor to the countrypolitan sound of the early 1970s. In addition to artists such as Murray and Campbell, several artists who were not initially marketed as country were enjoying crossover success with country audiences through radio airplay and sales. The most successful of these artists included The Bellamy Brothers, Charlie Rich, John Denver, Olivia Newton-John, Marie Osmond, Starland Vocal Band, B. J. Thomas and Kenny Rogers. Newton-John, an Australian pop singer, was named Female Vocalist of the Year by the Country Music Association, sparking a debate that continues to this day – what is country music? A group of traditional-minded artists, troubled by this trend, formed the short-lived Association of Country Entertainers, in an attempt to bring back traditional honky-tonk sounds to the forefront. The debate continued into 1975, a year where six songs reached No. 1 on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles and &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 charts. Things came to a head when, at that year&#x27;s CMA Awards, Rich – the reigning Entertainer of the Year, and himself a crossover artist – presented the award to his successor, &quot;my good friend, Mr. John Denver.&quot; His statement, taken as sarcasm, and his setting fire to the envelope (containing Denver&#x27;s name) with a cigarette lighter were taken as a protest against the increasing pop style in country music.

By the later half of the 1970s, Dolly Parton, a highly successful traditional-minded country artist since the late 1960s, mounted a high-profile campaign to crossover to pop music, culminating in her 1977 hit &quot;Here You Come Again,&quot; which peaked at No. 1 country and No. 3 pop. Rogers, the former lead singer of The First Edition, followed up a successful career in pop, rock and folk music by switching to country music. Like Parton, he enjoyed a long series of successful songs that charted on both the Hot Country Singles and Billboard Hot 100 charts; the first of the lot was &quot;Lucille,&quot; a No. 1 country and No. 5 pop hit. Crystal Gayle, Ronnie Milsap, Eddie Rabbitt and Linda Ronstadt were some of the other artists who also found success on both the country and pop charts with their records as well.

The 1970s continued a trend toward a proliferation of No. 1 hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles chart. In 1970, there were 23 songs that reached the top spot on the chart, but by the mid-1970s, more than 40 titles rotated in and out of the top spot for the first time in history. The trend temporarily reversed itself by the late 1970s, when about 30 to 35 songs reached the pinnacle position of the chart annually.

==Other developments==
In the second half of the decade, a 1950s nostalgia movement prompted the Rockabilly Revival fad. The Stray Cats led the revival into the early 1980s. Billy Joel provided &quot;Piano Man&quot; and &quot;Only The Good Die Young&quot;. Also symbolizing this trend was the hit movie &quot;Grease&quot; in 1978, starring John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John.

Tying in with the nostalgia craze, several stars of the late 1950s and early 1960s successfully revived their careers during the early- to mid-1970s after several years of inactivity. The most successful of these were Ricky Nelson (&quot;Garden Party&quot;, 1972), Neil Sedaka (&quot;Laughter in the Rain&quot; and &quot;Bad Blood&quot;, both 1975), and Frankie Valli as both a solo artist (1975&#x27;s &quot;My Eyes Adored You&quot;) and with The Four Seasons (1976&#x27;s &quot;December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)&quot;). In addition, Perry Como—one of the most successful pre-rock era artists—enjoyed continued success, albeit on a somewhat smaller scale (as most of his fans were adults who grew up during the 1940s and early 1950s, and not the rock record-buying youth); his most successful hits of the decade were &quot;It&#x27;s Impossible&quot; (1970) and the Don McLean song &quot;And I Love Her So&quot; (1973).
Two of popular music&#x27;s most successful artists died within six weeks of each other in 1977: Elvis Presley (on August 16) and Bing Crosby (on October 14). Presley—whose top 1970s hit was &quot;Burning Love&quot; in 1972— ranked among the top artists of the rock era, while Crosby was among the most successful pre-rock era artists.

The early seventies also marked the deaths of rock legends Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin, and Jimi Hendrix as well as the plane crash in 1977 in which three members of Lynyrd Skynyrd were killed.

<text>[[Popular music]] of the United States in the 1980s saw heavy metal, country music, Top 40 hits, hip hop, MTV, CMJ, and new wave
as mainstream. Punk rock and hardcore punk was popular on CMJ. With the demise of punk rock, a new generation of punk-influenced genres arose, including Gothic rock, post-punk, alternative rock, emo and thrash metal. Hip hop underwent its first diversification, with Miami bass, Chicago hip house, Washington, D.C. go-go, Detroit ghettotech, Los Angeles G-funk and the &quot;golden age of old school hip hop&quot; in New York City. House music developed in Chicago, techno music developed in Detroit which also saw the flowering of the Detroit Sound in gospel. This helped inspire the greatest crossover success of Christian Contemporary Music (CCM), as well as the Miami Sound of Cuban pop.

The 1980s saw the reinvention of Michael Jackson and the emergence and superstardom of Prince, Madonna and Whitney Houston. Their videos became a permanent fixture on MTV. In 1983 Michael Jackson became the first African American artist to be placed in heavy rotation on MTV, with his videos for Billie Jean, and Beat It. Donna Summer also had the first two videos She Works Hard for the Money and Unconditional Love, by an African American female artist in 1983. Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot; album from 1982 is considered to be the best-selling album of all time; it set a record and sold 20 million copies during the decade. His other album of the decade, 1987&#x27;s &quot;Bad&quot;, sold 6 million, and became the first album to have 5 number-one hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Jackson scored 9 #1 singles and 16 top 10 singles on the Billboard charts. Madonna scored 7 #1 singles, and 16 top 5 singles, and 17 top 10 singles. Whitney Houston is the only artist to have seven consecutive number-one singles on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, from &quot;Saving All My Love for You&quot; in 1985 to &quot;Where Do Broken Hearts Go&quot; in 1988. Her first two studio albums, &quot;Whitney Houston&quot; (1985) and &quot;Whitney&quot; (1987), both peaked at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and are among the best-selling albums of all time. Prince&#x27;s 1984 album &quot;Purple Rain&quot; spent six consecutive months atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

By 1980, the disco production of the 1970s, largely dependent on orchestras, is replaced by a lighter synthpop production. In the second half of the 1980s teen pop has its first wave. Bands and artists include New Kids on the Block, Debbie Gibson, Tiffany, New Edition, Stacey Q, The Bangles, Madonna and others.

Prominent American urban pop acts of the 1980s include Tina Turner, Lionel Richie, Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston, Donna Summer and Diana Ross.

Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Bruce Springsteen, Hall and Oates, Billy Joel, John Mellencamp, Bon Jovi, Prince, Kool &amp; the Gang, the Pointer Sisters and Kenny Rogers were among the most successful artists on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in the US. Prince was the top charting artist with 378 weeks on the pop charts, and Billy Joel was the top selling, he sold over 35 million albums.

Many British pop bands dominated the American charts in the early 1980s. Their popularity was helped by exposure on MTV, these bands included the Human League, Culture Club, Duran Duran, Wham!, also George Michael as a solo artist, Fine Young Cannibals, Rick Astley and Terence Trent D&#x27;Arby.

Canadian artist such as Bryan Adams, Anne Murray, Loverboy and Glass Tiger found chart success during the decade.

== Rock ==

=== Hard rock and heavy / glam metal ===
Beginning in 1983 and peaking in success in 1986–1989, the decade saw the resurgence of hard rock music and the emergence of its glam metal subgenre. Bands such as Def Leppard, Mötley Crüe, Bon Jovi, Quiet Riot, Europe, Ratt, Twisted Sister, Poison, Whitesnake, and Cinderella were among the most popular acts of the decade. The 1980s saw the emergence of wildly popular hard rock band Guns N&#x27; Roses and the successful comebacks of Aerosmith and Alice Cooper in the late 1980s. The success of hard rock act Van Halen spanned throughout the entire decade, first with singer David Lee Roth and later with Sammy Hagar. Queen, which had expanded its music to experimental and crossover genres in the early 1980s, returned to guitar-driven hard rock with &quot;The Miracle&quot; in 1989. Additionally, a few women managed to achieve stardom in the 1980s&#x27; hard rock scene: Pat Benatar and Ann &amp; Nancy Wilson of Heart, who had been around since the 1970s, is a prime example of female success in hard rock, and so are both ex-Runaways Joan Jett and Lita Ford.

The Arena rock trend of the 1970s continued in the 1980s with bands like Styx, Toto, Rush, Journey, Boston, Foreigner, REO Speedwagon, Van Halen, and Aerosmith which were popular into the early 1980s, with glam metal taking their place later.

Traditionally associated (and often confused) with Hard rock, heavy metal was also extremely popular throughout the decade, with Ozzy Osbourne achieving success during his solo career ; bands like Judas Priest, Iron Maiden and Dio were also widely popular North American acts. Speed metal pioneer Motörhead maintained its popularity through the releases of several albums.
Underground scenes produced an array of more extreme, aggressive Metal subgenres: thrash metal broke into the mainstream with bands such as Metallica, Slayer, Anthrax, and Megadeth, while other styles like death metal and black metal remaining subcultural phenomena.

The decade also saw the emergence of a string of guitar virtuosi, influenced by guitarists such as Jimi Hendrix and Eddie Van Halen; Joe Satriani, Steve Vai and Yngwie Malmsteen achieved international recognition for their skills. While considerably less numerous, bass guitar virtuosi also gained momentum in the 1980s : Billy Sheehan (of David Lee Roth and Mr. Big fame), Cliff Burton (of Metallica) and alternative/funk metal bassist Les Claypool (of Primus fame) became famous during that period.

Both hard rock and heavy metal were extremely popular live genres and bands toured extensively around the globe.

=== Alternative rock ===

Alternative rock and punk groups from the 1970s like Ramones and Talking Heads, as well as solo performers like Patti Smith and Tom Waits, grew their audiences significantly the early years of the 1980s. By 1984, a majority of groups signed to independent record labels were mining from a variety of rock and particularly 1960s rock influences. This represented a sharp break from the futuristic, hyper rational post-punk years.

Throughout the 1980s, alternative rock was mainly an underground phenomena. While on occasion a song would become a commercial hit or albums would receive critical praise in mainstream publications like &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, alternative rock in the 1980s was primarily relegated to independent record labels, fanzines, and college radio stations. Alternative bands built underground followings by touring constantly and regularly releasing low-budget albums. In the case of the United States, new bands would form in the wake of previous bands, which created an extensive underground circuit in America, filled with different scenes in various parts of the country. Although American alternative artists of the 1980s never generated spectacular album sales, they exerted a considerable influence on later alternative musicians and laid the groundwork for their success.

Early American alternative bands such as R.E.M., The Feelies, and Violent Femmes combined punk influences with folk music and mainstream music influences. R.E.M. was the most immediately successful; its debut album, &quot;Murmur&quot; (1983), entered the Top 40 and spawned a number of jangle pop followers.

American indie record labels SST Records, Twin/Tone Records, Touch and Go Records, and Dischord Records presided over the shift from the hardcore punk that then dominated the American underground scene to the more diverse styles of alternative rock that were emerging. Minnesota bands Hüsker Dü and The Replacements were indicative of this shift. Both started out as punk rock bands, but soon diversified their sounds and became more melodic.

By the late 1980s, the American alternative scene was dominated by styles ranging from quirky alternative pop (They Might Be Giants and Camper Van Beethoven), to noise rock (Sonic Youth, Big Black) to industrial rock (Ministry, Nine Inch Nails). These sounds were in turn followed by the advent of Boston&#x27;s the Pixies and Los Angeles&#x27; Jane&#x27;s Addiction.

The top mainstream American Alternative Rock bands of 1980s included Hüsker Dü, The Replacements, R.E.M., The Pixies, and Sonic Youth which were popular long before the Grunge movement of the early 1990s. Many alternative groups whose success peaked in the following decade started their careers in the 1980s, including The Flaming Lips, Nirvana, and Yo La Tengo.

=== Folk rock, roots rock ===

Rock singers and songwriters appeared including Heartland rockers such as Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, Bob Seger, and folk rockers such as Lucinda Williams, Rickie Lee Jones, Stevie Nicks and Warren Zevon. Roots rocker John Fogerty had hit &quot;Old Man Down the Road&quot; in 1985. Punk rock artists such as Patti Smith and Paul Westerberg(The Replacements) were popular as singers and songwriters.

In the late 1980s, new history of female U.S. folk artists was beginning with Suzanne Vega whose first album sold unexpectedly well. And Tracy Chapman, Nanci Griffith, k.d. lang and Tori Amos followed Suzanne Vega.

=== Other trends ===
Various older rock bands made a comeback, including The Beach Boys with &quot;Kokomo&quot;, The Kinks with Come Dancing and &quot;Do It Again&quot;, the Steve Miller Band with &quot;Abracadabra&quot;, and Steely Dan with &quot;Hey Nineteen&quot;. Bruce Springsteen released his blockbuster album &quot;Born In The U.S.A.&quot;, while Stevie Ray Vaughan and George Thorogood sparked a revival of blues. However, Led Zeppelin disbanded after John Bonham&#x27;s 1980 death. Linda Ronstadt who had been a huge contributor to the country rock &amp; pop rock movement of the 70s, did 3 albums of American Standards, coaxing the great orchestrator Nelson Riddle out of retirement, to collaborate with.

Hardcore punk flourished throughout the early to mid-1980s, with bands leading the genre such as Black Flag, Bad Brains, Minor Threat, Suicidal Tendencies, amongst others.

== Contemporary R&amp;B ==

Contemporary R&amp;B originated in the 1980s, when musicians started adding disco-like beats, high-tech production, and elements of hip hop, soul and funk to rhythm and blues, making it more danceable and modern. The top mainstream R&amp;B artists of 1980s included Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, Prince, Jermaine Jackson, The Whispers, The S.O.S. Band, Stevie Wonder, Kool &amp; the Gang, Yarbrough and Peoples, Smokey Robinson, Rick James, Diana Ross, Lionel Richie, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, Dazz Band, Evelyn King, Marvin Gaye, Mtume, DeBarge, Midnight Star, and Freddie Jackson.

In the mid-1980s, many of the recordings by artists Luther Vandross, Freddie Jackson, Sade, Anita Baker, Teddy Pendergrass, Peabo Bryson and others became known as &quot;quiet storm&quot;. The term had originated with Smokey Robinson&#x27;s 1975 album &quot;A Quiet Storm&quot;. Quiet storm has been described as &quot;R&amp;B&#x27;s answer to soft rock and adult contemporary—while it was primarily intended for black audiences, quiet storm had the same understated dynamics, relaxed tempos and rhythms, and romantic sentiment.&quot;

Tina Turner made a comeback in the mid 1980s, while Donna Summer, Diana Ross and The Pointer Sisters continued to have success on the pop charts, in the first half of the decade, Whitney Houston, Janet Jackson and Jody Watley scored hits on the pop music charts in the second half of the 80s. Richard J. Ripani wrote that Janet Jackson&#x27;s third studio album &quot;Control&quot; (1986) was &quot;important to the development of R&amp;B for a number of reasons&quot;, as she and her producers, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, &quot;crafted a new sound that fuses the rhythmic elements of funk and disco, along with heavy doses of synthesizers, percussion, sound effects, and a rap music sensibility.&quot; Ripani wrote that &quot;the success of &quot;Control&quot; led to the incorporation of stylistic traits of rap over the next few years, and Janet Jackson was to continue to be one of the leaders in that development.&quot; That same year, Teddy Riley began producing R&amp;B recordings that included hip hop influences. This combination of R&amp;B style and hip hop rhythms was termed &quot;new jack swing&quot;, and was applied to artists such as Bobby Brown, Keith Sweat, Guy, Jodeci, and Bell Biv DeVoe.

Michael Jackson remained a prominent figure in the genre in the late 1980s, following the release of his album &quot;Bad&quot; (1987) which sold more than 6 million copies in the US in the 80s, and went on the sell 30 million worldwide. Janet Jackson&#x27;s 1989 album &quot;Janet Jackson&#x27;s Rhythm Nation 1814&quot; continued the development of contemporary R&amp;B into the 1990s, as the album&#x27;s title track &quot;Rhythm Nation&quot; made &quot;use of elements from across the R&amp;B spectrum, including use of a sample loop, triplet swing, rapped vocal parts and blues notes.&quot;

== Hip hop ==

Encompassing graffiti art, break dancing, rap music, and fashion, hip-hop became the dominant cultural movement of the African American and Hispanic communities in the 1980s. The Hip hop musical genre had a strong influence on pop music in the late 1980s which still continues to the present day.

During the 1980s, the hip hop genre started embracing the creation of rhythm by using the human body, via the vocal percussion technique of beatboxing. Pioneers such as Doug E. Fresh, Biz Markie and Buffy from the Fat Boys made beats, rhythm, and musical sounds using their mouth, lips, tongue, voice, and other body parts. &quot;Human Beatbox&quot; artists would also sing or imitate turntablism scratching or other instrument sounds.

The 1980s also saw many artists make social statements through hip hop. In 1982, Melle Mel and Duke Bootee recorded &quot;The Message&quot; (officially credited to Grandmaster Flash and The Furious Five), a song that foreshadowed the socially conscious statements of Run-DMC&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s like That&quot; and Public Enemy&#x27;s &quot;Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos&quot;.

Popular Hip hop artists of the 1980s include Run D.M.C., Beastie Boys, NWA, LL Cool J, Public Enemy, Eric B. &amp; Rakim, Salt-n-Pepa, Big Daddy Kane, Boogie Down Productions, Whodini, De La Soul, Slick Rick, Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, and Ice-T, among others.

== Electronic music ==
In the 1980s, dance music records made using only electronic instruments became increasingly popular, largely influenced by the Electronic music of Kraftwerk and 1970s disco music. Such music was originally born of and popularized via regional nightclub scenes in the 1980s, and became the predominant type of music played in discothèques as well as the rave scene.

House music is a style of electronic dance music which originated in Chicago, Illinois, USA in the early 1980s. House music was strongly influenced by elements of soul- and funk-infused varieties of disco. Club play from pioneering DJs like Ron Hardy and Lil Louis, local dance music record shops, and the popular Hot Mix 5 shows on radio station WBMX-FM helped popularize house music in Chicago and among visiting DJs &amp; producers from Detroit. Trax Records and DJ International Records, local labels with wider distribution, helped popularize house music outside of Chicago. It eventually reached Europe before becoming infused in mainstream pop &amp; dance music worldwide during the 1990s.

It has been widely cited that the initial blueprint for Techno was developed during the mid-1980s in Detroit, Michigan, by Juan Atkins, Kevin Saunderson, Derrick May (the so-called &quot;Belleville Three&quot;), and Eddie Fowlkes, all of whom attended school together at Belleville High, near Detroit. Though initially conceived as party music that was played on daily mixed radio programs and played at parties given by cliquish, Detroit high school clubs, it has grown to be a global phenomenon.

== Country music ==

As the 1980s dawned, pop-influenced country music was the dominant style, through such acts as Kenny Rogers, Ronnie Milsap, T.G. Sheppard, Eddie Rabbitt, Crystal Gayle, Anne Murray and Dolly Parton. The 1980 movie &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot;, a romantic comedy starring John Travolta and Debra Winger, spawned a successful soundtrack album featuring pop-styled country songs, including &quot;Lookin&#x27; for Love&quot; by Johnny Lee, &quot;The Devil Went Down to Georgia&quot; by the Charlie Daniels Band, &quot;Could I Have This Dance&quot; by Murray and &quot;Love the World Away&quot; by Rogers. The songs, and the movie itself, resulted in an early 1980s boom in pop-style country music, and the era is sometimes known as the &quot;Urban Cowboy Movement&quot;.

By the mid-1980s, country music audiences were beginning to tire of country-pop. Although some pop-country artists continued to record and release successful songs and albums, the genre, in general, was beginning to suffer. By 1985, a &quot;New York Times&quot; article declared country music &quot;dead&quot;. However, by this time, several newcomers were working behind the scenes to reverse this perception.

The year 1986 brought forth several new artists who performed in traditional country styles, such as honky-tonk. This sparked the &quot;new traditionalist&quot; movement, or return to traditional country music. The most successful of these artists included Randy Travis, Dwight Yoakam, Ricky Van Shelton, and Holly Dunn. Also, artists like Kathy Mattea and Keith Whitley, both of whom had been performing for a few years prior, had their first major hits during 1986; Mattea was more folk-styled, while Whitley was pure honky-tonk. But the new traditionalist movement had already taken hold as early as 1981 when newcomers such as John Anderson and George Strait had their first big hits, and Reba McEntire had her first big hit in 1980; in addition, songwriter–guitarist and Chet Atkins prodigy Steve Wariner also emerged as a popular act starting in the early 1980s. Another boom period for newcomers with new traditionalist styles was 1989, when artists such as Clint Black, Alan Jackson, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Lorrie Morgan and Travis Tritt had their first big hits.

Vocal duos were also popular because of their harmonies, most notably The Bellamy Brothers and The Judds. Several of the Bellamy Brothers&#x27; songs included double-entendre&#x27; laden hooks, on songs such as &quot;Do You Love as Good As You Look&quot;. The Judds, a mother-and-daughter duo, combined elements of contemporary pop and traditional country music on songs such as &quot;Why Not Me&quot; and &quot;Grandpa (Tell Me &#x27;Bout the Good Ol&#x27; Days)&quot;.

Country music groups and bands continued to rise in popularity during the 1980s. The most successful of the lot was Alabama, a Fort Payne-based band that blended traditional and pop-country sounds with southern rock. Their concerts regularly sold out, while their single releases regularly reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart. In 1989, Alabama was named the Artist of the Decade by the Academy of Country Music. By the end of the 1980s, the group had sold more than 24 million albums in the United States.

Ranking just behind Alabama in popularity, as far as groups were concerned, were The Oak Ridge Boys and The Statler Brothers, both four-part harmony groups with gospel and country-pop stylings. The popularity of those three groups sparked a boom in new groups and bands, and by the end of the 1980s, fans were listening to such acts as Restless Heart and Exile, the latter which previously enjoyed success with the pop hit &quot;Kiss You All Over&quot;.

Despite the prevailing pop-country sound, enduring acts from the 1970s and earlier continued to enjoy great success with fans. George Jones, one of the longest-running acts of the time, recorded several successful singles, including the critically acclaimed &quot;He Stopped Loving Her Today&quot;. Conway Twitty continued to have a series of No. 1 hits, with 1986&#x27;s &quot;Desperado Love&quot; becoming his 40th chart-topper on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles chart, a record that stood for nearly 20 years. The movie &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot; profiled the life of Loretta Lynn (with Sissy Spacek in the lead role), while Willie Nelson also had a series of acting credits. Dolly Parton had much success in the 1980s, with several leading movie roles, two No. 1 albums and 13 number one hits and having many successful tours. Others who had been around for a while and continued to have great success were Eddy Arnold, Johnny Cash, Merle Haggard, Waylon Jennings, Ray Price, Hank Williams Jr. and Tammy Wynette.

<text>The East Siberian cod (Arctogadus borisovi), also known as the toothed cod, is an Arctic fish closely similar to the Arctic cod &quot;Arctogadus glacialis&quot; and also related to true cods (genus &quot;Gadus&quot;). It has been differentiated in appearance from the Arctic cod by having pronounced chin barbel. Their sides and back are dark olive and the belly are light grey with dark spots. They may grow up to 60 cm.

Fishes attributed to East Siberian cod are found off the western half of the Canadian coast and the coasts of Siberia and also off northern and southern coasts of Greenland. The fish prefers living close to the sea floor at depths of 15 to 40 m, but it sometimes enters estuaries. They may also be found under pack ice. They are of little economic value.

Newer research, based on both morphological and mitochondrial DNA data, has however concluded that the East Siberian cod is not a distinct species from the Arctic cod, but the genus &quot;Arctogadus&quot; comprises just a single species i.e. the Arctic cod &quot;Arctogadus glacialis&quot;.

<text>Turner Entertainment Company is an American multimedia company founded by Ted Turner on August 2, 1986. Purchased by Time Warner Entertainment on October 10, 1996, as part of its acquisition of Turner Broadcasting System (TBS), the company was largely responsible for overseeing the TBS library for worldwide distribution. In recent years, this role has largely been limited to being the copyright holder, as it has become an in-name-only subsidiary of Warner Bros., which currently administers their library.

==History==
On March 25, 1986, Ted Turner and his Turner Broadcasting System purchased Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) from Kirk Kerkorian for $1.5 billion, and renamed it MGM Entertainment Company, Inc. However, due to concerns in the financial community over the debt-load of his companies, on August 26, 1986, he was forced to sell the MGM name, all of United Artists (UA), and the MGM Culver City studio lot back to Kerkorian for approximately $300 million after months of ownership. But in order to still go about his plans to broadcast the MGM/UA assets as &quot;originals&quot; on his TBS and upcoming TNT channels, Turner struck a deal with Kerkorian; Turner kept the studio&#x27;s film, television and cartoon library as well as a small portion of the UA library, forming Turner Entertainment Company during the exchange. The company was headed by Roger Mayer, who was a former executive of MGM, and formed a development division with the intention of making movies and television shows. The library also included most of the pre-1950 Warner Bros. library (including all color &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoons released before August 1948), the Fleischer Studios/Famous Studios &quot;Popeye&quot; cartoons originally released by Paramount Pictures, the US/Canadian/Latin American/Australian distribution rights to the RKO Radio Pictures library (not including any films produced by Walt Disney and Samuel Goldwyn), and most of the &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; television franchise (not counting the television movie sequels owned by other companies), all of which were owned by UA. 

In order to save funds, Turner instituted a policy that they would pass on making sequels to now-Turner-owned properties in favor of colorization of old black-and-white movies. On December 2, 1987, Turner Entertainment had entered into an agreement with American Film Technologies to computer-colorize three films from the MGM library that were originally in black-and-white: &quot;Boom Town&quot;, &quot;They Were Expendable&quot; and &quot;Catered Affair&quot;, and Turner would have the option to have AFT colorize additional 22 films and has a second option for another 24 films by 1992. On December 10, 1987, Turner acquired the worldwide licensing rights to 800 of RKO&#x27;s films from its then-parent company Wesray Capital Corporation.

On October 3, 1988, Turner Broadcasting System launched the TNT network, and later Turner Classic Movies (TCM) in 1994 to use their former MGM/UA library. In doing so, Turner has played a major part in film preservation and restoration. By broadcasting such classic films as &quot;King Kong&quot;, &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, &quot;Casablanca&quot;, &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot;, &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; and the original &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;, on numerous Turner affiliated cable channels, as well as in showing them in revival movie houses and home video worldwide, Turner introduced a new generation to these films.

On November 29, 1989, Turner made another attempt to buy MGM/UA, but the deal failed, and they formed Turner Pictures and Turner Pictures Worldwide instead.

On October 29, 1991, Turner acquired Hanna-Barbera Productions and most of the pre-1991 Ruby-Spears Productions library from Great American Broadcasting for $320 million. Shortly after the acquisition, on October 1, 1992, Turner Broadcasting System launched Cartoon Network, and later Boomerang, to serve as the primary broadcaster of its vast animation library.

On August 17, 1993, Turner purchased Castle Rock Entertainment and New Line Cinema for over $650 million.

Turner Entertainment self-distributed much of its library for the first decade of its existence, but on October 10, 1996, Turner Broadcasting System was purchased by Time Warner Entertainment and its distribution functions were largely absorbed into Warner Bros. As a result, Turner Entertainment is now an in-name-only subsidiary of Warner Bros., serving merely as a copyright holder for a portion of their library. Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s current purpose as the in-name only unit of Warner Bros. Animation is to serve as the copyright holder for its creations such as &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; and &quot;Yogi Bear&quot; while Warner Bros. handles sales and merchandising.

==Divisions==
As a production company, Turner Entertainment also created original in-house programming, such as documentaries about the films it owns, new animated material based on &quot;Tom &amp; Jerry&quot; and other related cartoon properties, and once produced made-for-television films, miniseries, and theatrical films such as &quot;Gettysburg&quot;, &quot;Tom and Jerry: The Movie&quot;, &quot;Fallen&quot;, &quot;The Pagemaster&quot; and &quot;Cats Don&#x27;t Dance&quot; under the Turner Pictures banner. In 1995, the Turner Pictures production company developed a film slate. Turner also had an international distribution sales unit, accordingly named Turner Pictures Worldwide Distribution, Inc. Turner Pictures was folded into Warner Bros. after the Turner-Time Warner merger, and currently holds the distribution rights to the films made by the production division. Time Warner transferred some of Turner&#x27;s leftover projects like &quot;City of Angels&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Mail&quot; into Warner Bros.

===Turner Feature Animation===
Turner Feature Animation was Turner&#x27;s animation unit headed by David Kirschner and Paul Gertz. The two animated movies &quot;The Pagemaster&quot; and &quot;Cats Don&#x27;t Dance&quot; were produced under Turner&#x27;s animation unit. Spun off from the feature film division of Hanna-Barbera Productions, Turner Feature Animation was folded into Warner Bros. Feature Animation, which was then merged into Warner Bros. Animation.

==Home video==

In the first decade of its existence, Turner released most of its own catalogue on home video through Turner Home Entertainment (THE). However, the MGM and Warner Bros. film libraries which Turner owned were still distributed by MGM/UA Home Video along with THE until their rights expired in 1999, while THE handled the home video distribution of titles from the RKO library. THE released films produced by Turner Pictures on home video with their distributors and independently released the Hanna-Barbera cartoon library on home video.

THE also released World Championship Wrestling (WCW) pay-per-view (PPV) events, wrestler profiles, and &quot;Best Of&quot; packages on video until the demise of WCW in 2001; the WCW video library, along with the rights to the WCW name and certain talent contracts, were sold to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now known as WWE) in March 2001. In 1987, THE had signed a distribution deal with the Video Institute of the Soviet Union to release 10 titles from the pre-May 1986 MGM library in Russian videocassette rental shops, and the deal with Turner would be a first for the Soviet home video market, where officials indicate that there are 660,000 VCR recordings, and films include &quot;Zabriskie Point&quot;, and other titles, none of them were colorized.

From early 1995 to early 1997, THE also distributed home video releases from New Line Home Video, taking over from Columbia TriStar Home Video as well as distributing PBS programs on home video the year before (taking over from the defunct Pacific Arts). NLHE distributed New Line films on video by itself from 1997 until New Line Cinema merged with Warner Bros. in 2008. PBS shows are now distributed on video and DVD by PBS&#x27;s own distribution company, PBS Distribution.

In 1995, THE entered a distribution deal with Columbia TriStar Home Video in France, Britain, Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the deal expired in 1997 (although some films released on VHS by THE are distributed in the UK by First Independent Films).

Upon the Turner-Time Warner merger, THE was absorbed into Warner Home Video as an in-name-only unit in December 1996. However, Turner Classic Movies does release special edition DVD boxsets of films from both the Turner and Warner catalogs under the TCM label. (Some magazines, most notably &quot;Starlog,&quot; when listing upcoming releases from Warner related to Cartoon Network programming listed it as being released by THE, likely to differentiate it from other, adult-oriented titles.)

==Library==

Turner Entertainment&#x27;s current library includes:
* The Brut Productions library

<doc id="411056" wikidata="Q1584160" url="?curid=411056" title="Royal College of Surgeons of England">
<text>The Royal College of Surgeons of England (RCS England) is an independent professional body and registered charity that promotes and advances standards of surgical care for patients, and regulates surgery and dentistry in England and Wales. The college is located at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields in London. It publishes multiple medical journals including the &quot;Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England&quot;, the &quot;Faculty Dental Journal&quot;, and the &quot;Bulletin of the Royal College of Surgeons of England&quot;.

==History==
The origins of the college date to the fourteenth century with the foundation of the &quot;Guild of Surgeons Within the City of London&quot;. Certain sources date this as occurring in 1368. There was an ongoing dispute between the surgeons and barber surgeons until an agreement was signed between them in 1493, giving the fellowship of surgeons the power of incorporation. This union was formalised further in 1540 by Henry VIII between the Worshipful Company of Barbers (incorporated 1462) and the Guild of Surgeons to form the Company of Barber-Surgeons. In 1745 the surgeons broke away from the barbers to form the Company of Surgeons. In 1800 the company was granted a royal charter to become the Royal College of Surgeons in London. A further charter in 1843 granted it the present title of the Royal College of Surgeons of England.

==Members and Fellows of the College==
The correct way to address a member or fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons is to use the title Mr, Miss, Mrs, Ms, or Mx (not Dr). This system (which applies only to surgeons, not physicians) has its origins in the 16th century, when surgeons were barber-surgeons and did not have a medical degree (or indeed any formal qualification), unlike physicians, who, by the 18th century, held a university medical degree and could thus be referred to as &quot;Doctor&quot;. 

By the time the College of Surgeons received its royal charter in 1800, the Royal College of Physicians were insisting that candidates for membership of the College of Surgeons must first have a medical degree. Therefore, the ensuing years saw aspiring surgeons having to study medicine first and hence receive the title &#x27;doctor&#x27;. Thereafter, having obtained the diploma of Member or Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons he would revert to the title &quot;Mr&quot; as a snub to the RCP. Nowadays the title &quot;Mr&quot; is used by Members of the college who have passed the diploma MRCS examination and the college addresses Members as &quot;Mr&quot; or &quot;Ms&quot;.

In Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;, the distinction is made in the following conversation:
Despite Mortimer&#x27;s correction, he is referred to as &quot;Dr. Mortimer&quot; throughout the story.

A biographical register of fellows is available on Plarr&#x27;s Lives of the Fellows Online
==Buildings==
The Company of Surgeons moved from Surgeon&#x27;s Hall in Old Bailey to a site at 41 Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields in 1797. The British government presented the collection of John Hunter to the surgeons after acquiring it in 1799, and in 1803 the company purchased the adjoining house at 42 Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields to house the collection, which forms the basis of The Hunterian Museum. 

Construction of the first College building, to a design by George Dance the Younger, and James Lewis, took place on this site from 1805 to 1813. The company soon outgrew these premises and in 1834 No. 40, Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields was acquired and demolished along with the George Dance building, of which only a portion of the portico was retained. Sir Charles Barry won the public competition to design a replacement, constructing a facade largely of artificial stone composed of cast blocks of concrete and stucco. Barry extended this building southwards following the acquisition of Copeland&#x27;s Warehouse on Portugal Street, and the enlarged buildings opened in 1855.

The college buildings expanded to their current extent between 1888 &amp; 1889, when additional wings were constructed on the sites of numbers 39 &amp; 43 Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields and two storeys were added to the Charles Barry Building by the architect Stephen Salter (b.1826, d.1896).

In 1941 a German incendiary bomb hit the college causing extensive damage that necessitated major rebuilding during the 1950s and 60s. The surviving portion of the earlier buildings were listed Grade II* on 24 February 1958.

Planning consent for a major rebuilding of the non-listed buildings of the Royal College of Surgeons was granted by Westminster City Council in January 2017. The redevelopment of building has been designed by the architecture practice Hawkins\Brown. Barry&#x27;s famous north frontage and library will be preserved and restored and The Hunterian Museum will benefit from a new façade and entrance on Portugal Street, to the south of the site. A &quot;topping out&quot; ceremony for the new buildings was celebrated on 24 January 2020, but, as of January 2021, the buildings have not re-opened to the public.

The exterior of the building was one of the filming locations of &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot; episode &quot;The Mystery of the Spanish Chest&quot;.

==Hunterian Museum==

In 1799 the government purchased the collection of John Hunter which they presented to the college. This formed the basis of the Hunterian Collection, which has since been supplemented by others including an Odontological Collection (curated by A. E. W. Miles until the early 1990s) and the natural history collections of Richard Owen.

The Hunterian Museum is a member of The London Museums of Health &amp; Medicine group, and displays thousands of anatomical specimens, including the Evelyn tables, surgical instruments, paintings and sculptures about medical individuals and medicine.

==Faculties==
* Faculty of Dental Surgery
* Faculty of General Dental Practice
* Faculty of Anaesthetists (until 1988)

==Medals, awards and lectures==
The Cheselden Medal was instituted in 2009 in honour of William Cheselden &quot;to recognise unique achievements in, and exceptional contributions to, the advancement of surgery&quot;. The award is made at irregular intervals to reflect the outstanding qualities required of recipients and is deemed one of the college&#x27;s highest professional honours.

The Royal Colleges&#x27; Bronze Medal was instituted in 1957 and is awarded jointly with the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. It is awarded annually &quot;on the nomination of the Medical Group of the Royal Photographic Society for the outstanding example of photography in the service of medicine and surgery&quot;.

The Wood Jones Medal was instituted in 1975 to commemorate Frederic Wood Jones (Sir William Collins Professor of Human and Comparative Anatomy and Conservator of the Anatomy Museum 1945–52). It is awarded occasionally (triennially until 1994) by a Committee &quot;for contributions to anatomical knowledge or the teaching of anatomy in the tradition of Frederic Wood Jones&quot;.

The Clement-Price Award was founded in 1958 with a gift of 1,000 guineas from members of the staff of the Westminster Hospital in honour of Sir Clement Price Thomas. It is awarded triennially, or at such other interval as the President may decide, by the council on the recommendation of the Fellowship Election and Prize Committee, &quot;in recognition of meritorious contributions to surgery in its widest sense, without restriction of candidature&quot;.

The Lister Medal has been awarded since 1924 (mostly on a triennial basis), after the college was entrusted in 1920 with administrating the Lister Memorial Fund, in memory of pioneering British surgeon Joseph Lister. The award is decided in conjunction with the Royal Society, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, the University of Edinburgh, and the University of Glasgow. In addition to being presented with a medal, the recipient delivers the Lister Oration at the college.

The Honorary Gold Medal was instituted in 1802 and is awarded at irregular intervals &quot;for liberal acts or distinguished labours, researches and discoveries eminently conducive to the improvement of natural knowledge and of the healing art&quot;. Recipients to date include Sir Victor Negus, Sir Geoffrey Keynes, Sir Stanford Cade (all three in 1969), Professor Harold Ellis (1998), Professor Sir Alec Jeffreys (2002) and Dr Barry J. Marshall (2005).

The Bradshaw Lecture was founded in 1875 under the will of Mrs Sally Hall Bradshaw in memory of her husband, Dr William Wood Bradshaw. It is a biennial (annual until 1993) lecture on surgery, customarily given by a senior member of the council on or about the day preceding the second Thursday of December. (Given in alternate years, with the Hunterian Oration given in the intervening years). Not to be confused with the corresponding Bradshaw Lectures delivered to the Royal College of Physicians. See Bradshaw Lecture for list of past lectures and lecturers.

The Hunterian Oration was founded in 1853 when a bequest was made by the executors of John Hunter&#x27;s will, to provide for an annual dinner and oration in memory of the famous surgeon. It is now delivered biennially.

==Educational history==
Prior to 1820, to meet the requirements of London&#x27;s College of Surgeons, students would spend time in London and select courses of instruction in surgery by teachers at Guy&#x27;s Hospital, St Thomas&#x27; – together known as London&#x27;s Borough Hospitals – and as well as attend anatomy classes at private institutions such as William Hunter&#x27;s anatomy school, attached for a time to Middlesex Hospital. Although at this time some students of surgery had already acquired the M.D. (or its equivalent) qualification, it was not until the 1830s that students of surgery were required to have obtained a medical degree at a university before commencing studies for membership of the Royal College of Surgeons. By the 1830s, medical schools in London at the University of London, St George&#x27;s Hospital and King&#x27;s College, London had been established and the influence of the private schools was diminished.

The college owns and preserves corpses which are used for educational purposes. In 1998, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales observed that having staff preserve these corpses entailed &quot;many hours, sometimes weeks, of skilled work&quot;. There is a common law rule which states that &quot;there is no property in a corpse&quot;, but the court ruled that these preserved bodies were legitimately the &quot;property&quot; of the college and that two artists who had stolen a number of bodies were therefore guilty of theft.

Today, the RCS offers a range of both on-line e-learning modules and hands-on practical workshops to facilitate the CPD for trainee and consultant surgeons across varies specialties.

Since May 2017, the RCS started to offer a Postgraduate Certificate in Surgery to junior surgical trainees. This qualification combined e-learning modules and practical causes &quot;offer surgical trainees a high-quality, flexible and interactive way to build their surgical knowledge and skills&quot; across different surgical specialties.

<text>A was initially a vassal of the shogunate of the Kamakura and the Muromachi periods. In exchange for protection and the right to become &quot;jitō&quot; (manor&#x27;s lord), a &quot;gokenin&quot; had in times of peace the duty to protect the imperial court and Kamakura, then political capital of Japan. In times of war, he had to fight with his forces under the shōgun’s flag. From the mid-13th century, the fact that &quot;gokenin&quot; were allowed to become &quot;de facto&quot; owners of the land they administered, coupled to the custom that all &quot;gokenin&quot; children could inherit, brought the parcelization of the land and a consequent weakening of the shogunate. The &quot;gokenin&quot; class ceased to be a significant force during the Muromachi period and was supplanted by the figure of the &quot;daimyō&quot;. During the successive Edo period, the term finally came to indicate a direct vassal of the shōgun, below an , meaning that they did not have the right to an audience with the shōgun.

==Etymology==
The terms &quot;gokenin&quot; and &quot;kenin&quot; are etymologically related, but have very different meanings. Confusion can arise also because in documents sometimes this last word is used together with the honorific prefix (go + &quot;kenin&quot;). Under the ritsuryō legal system in use in Japan from the seventh to the tenth century, a &quot;kenin&quot; (&quot;house person&quot;) was a human being who, while legally property of a family, could be inherited but not sold and, unlike a slave, had some rights. For example, the inventory of a temple&#x27;s wealth mentions thirteen &quot;kenin&quot;, among them four women, who were in effect servants. 

From the beginning of the Japanese Middle Ages, the relationship between lords and vassals tended, even in the absence of real blood ties, to be seen as an ancestral bond where each side inherited the rights and duties of the previous generation. Both sides thought of and spoke of their relationship in terms suggesting kinship, hence the use of the term &quot;gokenin&quot;, the prefix &quot;go-&quot; denoting prestige having been added after the Heian period. This social class evolved during the Kamakura shogunate based on the personal, contractual and military relationship between the shōgun and individual &quot;gokenin&quot;. Until recently it was assumed Kamakura shōgun Minamoto no Yoritomo coined the word and the role when he started his campaign to gain power in 1180. The Azuma Kagami, diary of the shogunate, uses the term from its very first entries. The first reliable documentary evidence of a formal &quot;gokenin&quot; status and of actual vassal registers however dates to the early 1190s, and it seems therefore that the vassalage concept remained vague for at least the first decade of the shogunate&#x27;s life. In any event, by that date the three main administrative roles created by the Kamakura shogunate (&quot;gokenin&quot;, &quot;shugo&quot; [governor] and &quot;jitō&quot; [manor&#x27;s lord]) were certainly in existence. The right to appoint them was the very basis of Kamakura&#x27;s power and legitimacy.

==History==
===Fall of Kamakura===
&quot;Gokenin&quot; vassals were descendants of former shōen owners, former peasants or former samurai who had made a name for themselves in Minamoto no Yoritomo&#x27;s army during his military campaigns against the Taira clan and were rewarded after victory. They and the bands of samurai they hired provided the shōgun with the military force he needed. They also collected local taxes and ruled over territories they were entrusted with, but nominally didn&#x27;t own. Because the shōgun had usurped the emperor&#x27;s power to nominate them, they owed loyalty only to him. The &quot;gokenin&quot; title was earned by participating to an initiation ceremony, writing one&#x27;s name in a roster () and making an oath of vassalage. The Kamakura government retained the power to appoint and dismiss, but otherwise left &quot;gokenin&quot; &quot;shugo&quot; and &quot;jitō&quot; alone and free to use tax income as they saw fit. As long as they remained faithful, they had considerable autonomy from the central government. In time, because &quot;gokenin&quot; officials were rarely dismissed, their powers and land ownership became in practice hereditary. By the end of the shogunate, the government was little more than a coalition of semi-autonomous states.

===&quot;Gokenin&quot; and the &quot;daimyōs&quot;===
After the fall of the Kamakura in 1333, changes in the balance of power forced the Ashikaga, new ruling clan of Japan, to try to modify the state&#x27;s economy and structure. The process of reversing the extreme parcelization of the land would occupy the next couple of centuries. The dynasty/shogunate tried to eradicate local warlords and concentrate power in its hands, but this in fact only increased the level of hostility. It seized the lands of the Hōjō clan, former &quot;de facto&quot; rulers of Kamakura, and of all defeated &quot;gokenin&quot; but, at seeing the Ashikaga keep those lands for themselves, to the point where they had direct control of almost 25% of the country, their own allies started fearing for themselves and their heirs. The ensuing turmoil gave inadvertently rise to the figure of the &quot;daimyō&quot; feudal lord, although the term wouldn&#x27;t be in wide use for the first half a century. Many &quot;daimyōs&quot; were &quot;shugo&quot; or &quot;jitō&quot; of &quot;gokenin&quot; extraction or even noblemen, but most were new faces who had supplanted their superiors. Crucially, because resisting the Ashikaga required a strong central power and a smooth succession, among them inheritance was no longer shared, but passed on intact to a single heir, who often was not even a blood relative, but a promising man adopted specifically to be heir.

===Edo period===
In the Edo period, &quot;gokenin&quot; were the lowest-ranking direct vassals of the Tokugawa shogunate, next to the &quot;hatamoto&quot;. Unlike a &quot;hatamoto&quot;, a &quot;gokenin&quot; was not of &quot; status – in other words, he had no right to an audience with the shōgun. From the mid-Edo period, wealthy and farmers could join the samurai class by giving a large sum of money to an impoverished &quot;gokenin&quot; to be adopted into a samurai family and inherit the samurai&#x27;s position and stipend. The amount of money given to a &quot;gokenin&quot; varied according to his position: 1,000 &quot;ryo&quot; for a and 500 &quot;ryo&quot; for an . Some of their descendants were promoted to &quot;hatamoto&quot; and held important positions in the shogunate.

<text>The saffron cod &quot;(Eleginus gracilis)&quot; is a commercially harvested fish closely related to true cods (genus &quot;Gadus&quot;). It is dark grey-green to brown, with spots on its sides and pale towards the belly. It may grow to 55 cm and weigh up to 1.3 kg.

Its range spans the North Pacific, from the Yellow Sea and the Sea of Okhotsk in the west to the northern Gulf of Alaska and Sitka, Alaska, in the east. It also occurs in the Chukchi Sea (Arctic Ocean). It normally occurs in shallow coastal waters at less than 60 m depth but may also be found at depths up to 200 m. The saffron cod may also enter brackish and even fresh waters, occurring quite far up rivers and streams, but remaining within regions of tidal influence.

Saffron cods begin to mature during their third year of life. They feed on fish and small crustaceans. They are commercially fished in many areas of the northwestern Pacific. The country with the largest catch is Russia. It is used for human consumption in the Russian Federation and Japan, fresh or frozen.

Most elapids are venomous, with the exception of the genus &quot;Emydocephalus&quot;. Many members of this family exhibit a threat display of rearing upwards while spreading out a neck flap. Elapids are endemic to tropical and subtropical regions around the world, with terrestrial forms in Asia, Australia, Africa, and the Americas and marine forms in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Members of the family have a wide range of sizes, from the white-lipped snake to the king cobra. Most species have neurotoxic venom that is channeled by their hollow fangs, and some may contain other toxic components in varying proportions. The family includes 55 genera with around 360 species and over 170 subspecies.

==Description==
Terrestrial elapids look similar to the Colubridae; almost all have long, slender bodies with smooth scales, a head covered with large shields (and not always distinct from the neck), and eyes with rounded pupils. Also like colubrids, their behavior is usually quite active and fast, with most of the females being oviparous (egg-layers). Exceptions to these generalizations occur; for example, certain adders (&quot;Acanthophis&quot;) have commonalities with the Viperidae family, such as shorter, stout bodies, rough/keeled scales, broad heads, cat-like pupils and ovoviviparous (internal hatchings with live births). Furthermore, they can also be sluggish, ambush predators with partially fragmented head shields, similar to rattlesnakes or Gaboon vipers.

Sea snakes (the Hydrophiinae), sometimes considered to be a separate family, have adapted to a marine way of life in different ways and to various degrees. All have evolved paddle-like tails for swimming and the ability to excrete salt. Most also have laterally compressed bodies, their ventral scales are much reduced in size, their nostrils are located dorsally (no internasal scales), and they give birth to live young (viviparity). The reduction in ventral scaling has greatly diminished their terrestrial mobility, but aids in swimming.

Members of this family have a wide range of sizes. &quot;Drysdalia&quot; species are small serpents typically and down to in length. Cobras, mambas, and taipans are mid- to large sized snakes which can reach or above. The king cobra is the world&#x27;s longest venomous snake with a maximum length of and an average mass of .

===Dentition===

All elapids have a pair of proteroglyphous fangs to inject venom from glands located towards the rear of the upper jaw (except for the genus &quot;Emydocephalus&quot;, in which fangs are present as a vestigial feature but without venom production, as they have specialized toward a fish egg diet, making them the only non-venomous elapids). The fangs, which are enlarged and hollow, are the first two teeth on each maxillary bone. Usually only one fang is in place on each side at any time. The maxilla is intermediate in both length and mobility between typical colubrids (long, less mobile) and viperids (very short, highly mobile). When the mouth is closed, the fangs fit into grooved slots in the buccal floor and usually below the front edge of the eye and are angled backwards; some elapids (&quot;Acanthophis&quot;, taipan, mamba, and king cobra) have long fangs on quite mobile maxillae and can make fast strikes. A few species are capable of spraying their venom from forward-facing holes in their fangs for defense, as exemplified by spitting cobras.

==Behavior==
Most elapids are terrestrial, while some are strongly arboreal (African &quot;Pseudohaje&quot; and &quot;Dendroaspis&quot;, Australian &quot;Hoplocephalus&quot;). Many species are more or less specialized burrowers (e.g. &quot;Ogmodon&quot;, &quot;Parapistocalamus&quot;, &quot;Simoselaps&quot;, &quot;Toxicocalamus&quot;, and &quot;Vermicella&quot;) in either humid or arid environments. Some species have very generalised diets (euryphagy), but many taxa have narrow prey preferences (stenophagy) and correlated morphological specializations, for example feeding almost exclusively on other serpents (especially the king cobra and kraits). Elapids may display a series of warning signs if provoked, either obviously or subtly. Cobras and mambas lift their inferior body parts, expand hoods, and hiss if threatened; kraits often curl up before hiding their heads down their bodies.

In general, sea snakes are able to respire through their skin. Experiments with the yellow-bellied sea snake, &quot;Hydrophis platurus&quot;, have shown that this species can satisfy about 20% of its oxygen requirements in this manner, allowing for prolonged dives. The sea kraits (&quot;Laticauda&quot; spp.) are the sea snakes least adapted to aquatic life. Their bodies are less compressed laterally, and they have thicker bodies and ventral scaling. Because of this, they are capable of some land movement. They spend much of their time on land, where they lay their eggs and digest prey.

==Distribution==
Terrestrial elapids are found worldwide in tropical and subtropical regions, mostly in the Southern Hemisphere. Most prefer humid tropical environments, though there are many that can still be found in arid environments. Sea snakes occur mainly in the Indian Ocean and the south-west Pacific. They occupy coastal waters and shallows, and are common in coral reefs. However, the range of &quot;Hydrophis platurus&quot; extends across the Pacific to the coasts of Central and South America.

==Venom==
Venoms of species in the Elapidae are mainly neurotoxic for immobilizing prey and defense. The main group of toxins are PLA2 and three-finger toxins (3FTx). Other toxic components in some species comprise cardiotoxins and cytotoxins, which cause heart dysfunctions and cellular damage, respectively. Cobra venom also contains hemotoxins that clot or solidify blood. Most members are venomous to varying extents, and some are considered among the world&#x27;s most venomous snakes based upon their murine values, such as the taipans. Large species, mambas and cobras included, are dangerous for their ability to inject large quantities of venom upon a single envenomation and/or striking at a high position proximal to the victim&#x27;s brain, which is vulnerable to neurotoxicity. Antivenom is promptly required to be administered if bitten by any elapids. Specific antivenoms are the only cure to treat elapidae bites. There are commercial monovalent and polyvalent antivenoms for cobras, mambas, and some other important elapids. Recently, experimental antivenoms based on recombinant toxins have shown that it is feasible to create antivenoms with a wide spectrum of coverage.

The venom of spitting cobras is more cytotoxic rather than neurotoxic. It damages local cells, especially those in eyes, which are deliberately targeted by the snakes. The venom may cause intense pain on contact with the eye and may lead to blindness. It is not lethal on skin if no wound provides any chance for the toxins to enter the bloodstream.

==Taxonomy==
The table below lists out all of the elapid genera and no subfamilies. In the past, many subfamilies were recognized, or have been suggested for the Elapidae, including the Elapinae, Hydrophiinae (sea snakes), Micrurinae (coral snakes), Acanthophiinae (Australian elapids), and the Laticaudinae (sea kraits). Currently, none are universally recognized. Molecular evidence via techniques like karyotyping, protein electrophoretic analyses, immunological distance and DNA sequencing, suggests reciprocal monophyly of two groups: African, Asian, and New World Elapinae versus Australasian and marine Hydrophiinae. The Australian terrestrial elapids are technically &#x27;hydrophiines&#x27;, although they are not sea snakes. It is believed that the &quot;Laticauda&quot; and the &#x27;true sea snakes&#x27; evolved separately from Australasian land snakes. Asian cobras, coral snakes, and American coral snakes also appear to be monophyletic, while African cobras do not.

The type genus for the Elapidae was originally &quot;Elaps&quot;, but the group was moved to another family. In contrast to what is typical of botany, the family Elapidae was not renamed. In the meantime, &quot;Elaps&quot; was renamed &quot;Homoroselaps&quot; and moved back to the Elapidae. However, Nagy &quot;et al.&quot; (2005) regard it as a sister taxon to &quot;Atractaspis&quot;, which should have been assigned to the Atractaspididae.
&quot;* Not including the nominate subspecies&quot;

==Conservation==
With the dangers the taxa presents given their venomous nature it is very difficult for activists and conservationists alike to get species on protection lists such as the IUCN red-list and CITES Apenndix lists. Some of the protected species are:

* Vulnerable:
** &quot;Ophiophagus hannah&quot; (King cobra)
** &quot;Austrelaps labialis&quot; (Pygmy copperhead)
** &quot;Denisonia maculate&quot; (Ornamental snake)
** &quot;Echiopsis atriceps&quot; (Lake Cronin snake)
** &quot;E. curta&quot; (Bardick)
** &quot;Furina dunmalli&quot; (Dunmall&#x27;s snake)
** &quot;Hoplocephalus bungaroides&quot; (Broad-headed snake)
** &quot;Ogmodon vitianus&quot; (Fiji snake)
* Lower Risk/Near threatened:
** &quot;Elapognathus minor&quot; (Short-nosed snake)
** &quot;Simoselaps calonotus&quot; (Black-striped snake)

This however does not touch the number of elapidae that are under threat, for instance 9% of elapid sea snakes are threatened with another 6% near-threatened. A rather large road block that stands in the way of more species being put under protection is lack of knowledge of the taxa; many known species have little research done on their behaviors or actual population as they live in very remote areas or live in habitats that are so vast its nearly impossible to conduct population studies, like the sea snakes.

<text>Notothenia angustata, the Maori chief or black cod, is a species of marine ray-finned fish, belonging to the family Nototheniidae, the notothens or cod icefishes. It is native to the Southern Ocean

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Notothenia angustata&quot; was first formally described in 1875 by the English-born New Zealand scientist Frederick Wollaston Hutton with the type locality given as Dunedin in New Zealand. The specific name &quot;angustata&quot; means &quot;narrowed&quot; a reference to the relatively narrow head of this species.

==Description==
&quot;Notothenia angustata&quot; is a large demersal fish which is quite similar in shape and colour to the Maori cod (&quot;Paranotothen magellanica&quot;). The mouth is large and there are obvious bony ridge over each eye. They have a rounded caudal fin and slightly overlapping lateral lines. The small first dorsal fin has six spines. The colour is dark grey or green on the upper body with blue-black mottling and it has a yellow abdomen. There are many small grey spots and streaks on the head and the grey fins have dark mottling. This species attains a maximum total length of .

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Notothenia angustata&quot; is found in the Southern Ocean and the Southern Pacific Ocean. It is found from New Zealand and Chile south and throughout the Subantarctic, at depths to . The juveniles are often found in tide pools, with the adults on rocky reefs.

==Biology==
&quot;Notothenia angustata&quot; feeds on cephalopods, benthic invertrebrates and small fishes. However, in Chile, a study found that the main component of their diet was algae. This species has some of the same genes as its more southerly relatives for the production of antifreeze proteins in its blood. The Chilean study referenced above found 11 taxa of parasites living in specimens of this species including digeneans, cestodes and nematodes.

==Utilisation==
&quot;Nothotenia angustata&quot; is caught using hook and lines and the flesh is edible but not highly regarded and any caught tend to be used as bait in lobster fisheries.

<text>James Edmund Caan ( ; March 26, 1940 – July 6, 2022) was an American actor. He gained prominence playing Sonny Corleone in &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972) – which he was him nominated for an Academy Award and Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor. He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1978.

After early roles in Howard Hawks&#x27; &quot;El Dorado&quot; (1966), Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;Countdown&quot; (1967) and Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Rain People&quot; (1969), Caan gained acclaim for his portrayal of Brian Piccolo in the 1971 television movie &quot;Brian&#x27;s Song&quot;, for which he received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie nomination. Caan received Golden Globe Award nominations for his performances in the drama &quot;The Gambler&quot; (1974), and the musical &quot;Funny Lady&quot; (1975). He continued to receive significant roles in feature films such as &quot;Cinderella Liberty&quot; (1973), &quot;Rollerball&quot; (1975), &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; (1977), &quot;Comes a Horseman&quot; (1978), &quot;Chapter Two&quot; (1979) and &quot;Thief&quot; (1981).

After a five-year break from acting, he returned with roles in &quot;Gardens of Stone&quot; (1987), &quot;Misery&quot; (1990), &quot;Honeymoon in Vegas&quot; (1992), &quot;Eraser&quot; (1996), &quot;Mickey Blue Eyes&quot; (1999), &quot;The Yards&quot; (2000), &quot;City of Ghosts&quot; (2002), &quot;Elf&quot; (2003) and &quot;Get Smart&quot; (2008).

== Early life ==
Caan was born on March 26, 1940, in The Bronx, New York City, to Sophie (&quot;née&quot; Falkenstein; 1915–2016) and Arthur Caan (1909–1986), Jewish immigrants from Bingen am Rhein, Rhineland, Germany. His father was a kosher meat dealer. James grew up a lively boy and often participated in street fights. At that time he enjoyed boxing, rodeo and motorcycle riding. One of three siblings, Caan grew up in Sunnyside, Queens. His sister, Barbara Emily Caan (Licker), died of leukemia in 1981, aged 38.

Caan was educated in New York City, and later attended Michigan State University (MSU). He was a member of the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity during his two years at Michigan State. During his time at MSU he wanted to play football but was unable to make the team. He later transferred to Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, but did not graduate. His classmates at Hofstra included Francis Ford Coppola and Lainie Kazan.

While studying at Hofstra University, Caan became intrigued with acting. He enrolled in New York City&#x27;s Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre, where he studied for five years. One of his instructors was Sanford Meisner. &quot;I just fell in love with acting,&quot; he later recalled. &quot;Of course all my improvs ended in violence.&quot;

== Career ==

=== 1960s ===
Caan began appearing off-Broadway in plays such as Arthur Schnitzler&#x27;s &quot;La Ronde&quot; before making his 1961 Broadway debut in &quot;Blood, Sweat and Stanley Poole&quot;. In 1969, he starred in Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Rain People&quot;.

Caan&#x27;s first television appearance was in an episode of &quot;Naked City&quot;. He was also seen in episodes of &quot;Play of the Week&quot;, &quot;Route 66&quot;, &quot;Alcoa Premiere&quot;, &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot;, &quot;The Untouchables&quot; (in an episode guest starring Lee Marvin), &quot;The Doctors and the Nurses&quot;, “Wagon Train” &quot;Death Valley Days&quot; (twice), &quot;Wide Country&quot;, and &quot;Combat!&quot; as a clever German sergeant. He guest-starred on &quot;Ben Casey&quot; and &quot;Kraft Suspense Theatre&quot;.

His first film was &quot;Irma la Douce&quot; (1963), in which he had an uncredited bit part as a U.S. soldier with a transistor radio more interested in a baseball game than the girl. According to &quot;Filmink&quot; magazine:

People thought Caan was going to be a star pretty much from the get-go. And it&#x27;s not hard to see why. Watch him in his early movies and TV appearances, and he&#x27;s simply got &quot;it&quot;: he was handsome, virile-looking, and could act (New York trained, Broadway broken). Most of all, he had X factor: a nervous energy and intensity that you can feel off the screen. A lot of stars take a while to warm up – Caan was good from the beginning.

Caan&#x27;s first substantial film role was as a punk hoodlum who gets his eyes poked out in the 1964 thriller &quot;Lady in a Cage&quot;, which starred Olivia de Havilland, who praised Caan&#x27;s performance. He had roles in &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot; and &quot;Wagon Train&quot;. He was fourth-billed in a Western feature, &quot;The Glory Guys&quot; (1965). He turned down the starring role in a TV series around this time, saying, &quot;I want to be an actor not a millionaire.&quot;

In 1965, Caan landed his first starring role, in Howard Hawks&#x27; auto-racing drama &quot;Red Line 7000&quot;. It was not a financial success. But Hawks liked Caan and cast him in his next film, &quot;El Dorado&quot;, playing Alan Bourdillion Traherne, a.k.a. Mississippi, in support of John Wayne and Robert Mitchum. He had the starring role in Robert Altman&#x27;s second feature film, &quot;Countdown&quot; (1967) and was second billed in the Curtis Harrington thriller &quot;Games&quot; (1967). Caan went to Britain to star in a war film, &quot;Submarine X-1&quot; (1968), then played the lead in a Western, &quot;Journey to Shiloh&quot; (1968).

He returned to television with a guest role in &quot;The F.B.I.&quot;. He had an uncredited spot on the spy sitcom &quot;Get Smart&quot; as a favor to star Don Adams, playing Rupert of Rathskeller in the episode &quot;To Sire with Love&quot;.

Caan won praise for his role as a brain-damaged football player in &quot;The Rain People&quot; (1969), directed by Francis Ford Coppola. He starred with Stefanie Powers in a Western called &quot;Gone with the West&quot;, filmed in 1969, that was not released until 1975.

None of these films, apart from &quot;El Dorado&quot;, was particularly successful at the box office, including &quot;Rabbit, Run&quot; (1970), based on the John Updike novel of the same name, in which Caan had the lead. He said it &quot;was a film I really wanted to do, really wanted to be involved with.&quot; &quot;No one would put me in a movie&quot;, he later recalled. &quot;They all said, &#x27;His pictures never make money&#x27;.&quot;

=== 1970s ===
Caan returned to the small screen with the TV movie &quot;Brian&#x27;s Song&quot; (1971), playing dying football player Brian Piccolo, opposite Billy Dee Williams. Caan did not want to return to television and turned down the role several times, but changed his mind after reading the script. The film was a huge critical success and Caan&#x27;s performance earned him an Emmy nomination. He got a deal to make a film and agreed to be in &quot;T.R. Baskin&quot;.

The following year, Coppola cast him as the short-tempered Sonny Corleone in &quot;The Godfather&quot;. Originally, Caan was cast as Michael Corleone (Sonny&#x27;s youngest brother); both Coppola and Caan demanded that this role be played by Al Pacino, so Caan could play Sonny instead. Robert De Niro was also considered to play Sonny. Although another actor, Carmine Caridi, was already signed to play Sonny, the studio eventually insisted on having Caan, so he remained in the production. Caan was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in the film, along with co-stars Robert Duvall and Pacino. Caan was closely identified with the role for years afterward: &quot;They called me a wiseguy. I won Italian of the Year twice in New York, and I&#x27;m Jewish, not Italian... I was denied in a country club once. Oh yeah, the guy sat in front of the board, and he says, &#x27;No, no, he&#x27;s a wiseguy, been downtown. He&#x27;s a made guy.&#x27; I thought, What? Are you out of your mind?&quot;

Caan was now established as a leading movie star. He was in a road movie, &quot;Slither&quot; (1973), based on a script by W. D. Richter; and a romantic comedy with Marsha Mason, &quot;Cinderella Liberty&quot; (1973), directed by Mark Rydell. He received good reviews for playing the title role in &quot;The Gambler&quot; (1974), based on a script by James Toback originally written for Robert De Niro, and directed by Karel Reisz. More popular at the box office was the action comedy &quot;Freebie and the Bean&quot; (1974) with Alan Arkin.

Caan reprised his role as Sonny Corleone for a flashback scene in &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; (1974). He had a hit with &quot;Funny Lady&quot; (1975) playing Billy Rose opposite Barbra Streisand&#x27;s Fanny Brice. Caan starred in two action films, Norman Jewison&#x27;s &quot;Rollerball&quot; (1975) as a star athlete of a deadly extreme sport, and Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s &quot;The Killer Elite&quot; (1975). Both were popular, though Caan hated &quot;Elite&quot;. He made a cameo in Mel Brooks&#x27; &quot;Silent Movie&quot; (1976), and tried comedy with Rydell&#x27;s &quot;Harry and Walter Go to New York&quot; (1976). Caan was so unhappy with the latter he sacked his management. He said he did not want to make &quot;Elite&quot; or &quot;Harry&quot; but &quot;people kept telling me I had to be commercial.&quot;

Caan was one of many stars in the war film &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; (1977). He had a change of pace when he went to France to make &quot;Another Man, Another Chance&quot; (1977) for director Claude Lelouch alongside Geneviève Bujold, which Caan did for &quot;peanuts&quot; and &quot;loved&quot; the experience.

Back in the United States, Caan made a modern-day Western, &quot;Comes a Horseman&quot; (1978), with Jane Fonda for director Alan J. Pakula. He was reunited with Marsha Mason in the film adaptation of Neil Simon&#x27;s autobiographical &quot;Chapter Two&quot; (1979). Caan later said he only did the film for the money as he was trying to raise money for his directorial debut, but it was a success at the box office.

In 1978, Caan directed &quot;Hide in Plain Sight&quot;, a film about a father searching for his children, who were lost in the Witness Protection Program. Despite critical praise, the film was only moderately successful with the public.

During Caan&#x27;s peak years of stardom, he rejected a series of starring roles that proved to be successes for other actors, in films including &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, &quot;The French Connection&quot;, &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;, &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;, &quot;Kramer vs. Kramer&quot; (&quot;it was such middle class bourgeois baloney&quot;), &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; (because Coppola &quot;mentioned something about 16 weeks in the Philippine jungles&quot;), &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, &quot;Love Story&quot;, and &quot;Superman&quot; (&quot;I didn&#x27;t want to wear the cape&quot;.). In 1977, Caan rated several of his movies out of ten – &quot;The Godfather&quot; (10), &quot;Freebie and the Bean&quot; (4), &quot;Cinderella Liberty&quot; (8), &quot;The Gambler&quot; (8), &quot;Funny Lady&quot; (9), &quot;Rollerball&quot; (8), &quot;The Killer Elite&quot; (5), &quot;Harry and Walter Go to New York&quot; (0), &quot;Slither&quot; (4), &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; (7), and &quot;Another Man Another Chance&quot; (10). He also liked his performances in &quot;The Rain People&quot; and &quot;Thief&quot;.

=== 1980s ===
Caan had a role in Claude Lelouch&#x27;s &quot;Les Uns et les Autres&quot; (1981), which was popular in France, and won the Technical Grand Prize at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival. In Hollywood, Caan appeared in the neo-noir film &quot;Thief&quot; (1981), directed by Michael Mann, in which he played a professional safe cracker. Although the film was not successful at the time, Caan&#x27;s performance was widely lauded and the movie has acquired something of a cult following. Caan always praised Mann&#x27;s script and direction and often said that, next to &quot;The Godfather&quot;, &quot;Thief&quot; was the movie of which he was proudest.

From 1982 to 1987, Caan suffered from depression over his sister&#x27;s death from leukemia, a growing problem with cocaine, and what he described as &quot;Hollywood burnout&quot; and did not act in any films.

In a 1992 interview, Caan said that this was a time when &quot;a lot of mediocrity was produced. Because I think that directors got to the point where they made themselves too important. They didn&#x27;t want anything or anybody to distract from their directorial prowess. There were actors who were good and capable, but they would distract from the special effects. It was a period of time when I said, &#x27;I&#x27;m not going to work again.&#x27;&quot;

He walked off the set of &quot;The Holcroft Covenant&quot; and was replaced by Michael Caine. Caan devoted much of his time during these years to coaching children&#x27;s sports. In 1985, he was in a car crash. Caan considered retiring for good but instead of being &quot;set for life&quot;, as he believed, he found out one day that &quot;I was flat-ass broke... I didn&#x27;t want to work. But then when the dogs got hungry and I saw their ribs, I decided that maybe now it&#x27;s a good idea.&quot;

Caan returned to acting in 1987, when Coppola cast him as an army platoon sergeant for the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard) in &quot;Gardens of Stone&quot;, a movie that dealt with the effect of the Vietnam War on the United States homefront. He only received a quarter of his pre-hiatus salary, and then had to kick in tens of thousands more to the completion bond company because of &quot;Holcroft&quot;. &quot;I don&#x27;t know what it is, but, boy, when you&#x27;re down, they like to stomp on you&quot;, he said. The movie was not a popular success but &quot;Alien Nation&quot; (1988), where Caan played a cop who partnered with an alien, did well. The film received a television spinoff. He had a support role as Spaldoni, under much make up, in Warren Beatty&#x27;s &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;.

=== 1990s ===
Caan was planning to make an action film in Italy, but then heard Rob Reiner was looking for a leading man in his adaptation of Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;Misery&quot; (1990). Since the script for &quot;Misery&quot; called for the male lead, Paul Sheldon, to spend most of his time lying in bed tormented by his nurse, the role was turned down by many of Hollywood&#x27;s leading actors before Caan accepted. Caan had a small role in &quot;The Dark Backward&quot; (1991) and co-starred with Bette Midler in the expensive &quot;For the Boys&quot; (1991), directed by Rydell who called Caan &quot;one of the four or five best actors in America&quot;.

Caan was a gangster in the comedy &quot;Honeymoon in Vegas&quot; (1992) and played Coach Winters in &quot;The Program&quot; (1993). He had supporting roles in &quot;Flesh and Bone&quot; (1993) and &quot;A Boy Called Hate&quot; (1995), the latter starring his son Scott Caan. In 1996, he appeared in &quot;North Star&quot;, a Western; &quot;Bottle Rocket&quot;, the directorial debut of Wes Anderson; &quot;Eraser&quot;, with Arnold Schwarzenegger; and &quot;Bulletproof&quot; with Adam Sandler and Damon Wayans. In 1998, Caan portrayed Philip Marlowe in the HBO film &quot;Poodle Springs&quot;. He was also in &quot;This Is My Father&quot; (1998). Caan was a gangster for comedy in &quot;Mickey Blue Eyes&quot; (1999), with Hugh Grant.

=== 2000s ===
Caan was in &quot;The Yards&quot; (2000) with Mark Wahlberg and director James Gray, &quot;Luckytown&quot; (2000) with Kirsten Dunst, and &quot;The Way of the Gun&quot; (2000) for Christopher McQuarrie. Caan starred in TV movies like &quot;Warden of Red Rock&quot; (2001) and &quot;A Glimpse of Hell&quot; (2001), and was in some thrillers: &quot;Viva Las Nowhere&quot; (2001), &quot;In the Shadows&quot; (2001), and &quot;Night at the Golden Eagle&quot; (2002). He was in &quot;Lathe of Heaven&quot; with Lukas Haas (2002), &quot;City of Ghosts&quot; (2002) with Matt Dillon, &quot;Blood Crime&quot; (2002), &quot;The Incredible Mrs. Ritchie&quot; (2003), and &quot;Jericho Mansions&quot; (2003). Most of these films were not widely seen, but &quot;Dogville&quot; (2003) and &quot;Elf&quot; (2003), in which Caan had key supporting roles, were big successes on the art house and commercial circuit respectively.

In 2003, Caan portrayed Jimmy the Con in the film &quot;This Thing of Ours&quot;, whose associate producer was Sonny Franzese, longtime mobster and underboss of the Colombo crime family. The same year, Caan played Will Ferrell&#x27;s estranged book publisher father in the enormously successful family Christmas comedy &quot;Elf&quot;, and auditioned for, and won, the role of Montecito Hotel/Casino president &quot;Big Ed&quot; Deline in &quot;Las Vegas&quot;. On February 27, 2007, Caan announced that he would not return to the show for its fifth season to return to film work; he was replaced by Tom Selleck.

Caan had a role in the TV movie &quot;Wisegal&quot; (2008), played the President of the United States in the 2008 film &quot;Get Smart&quot;, and had a part in the movie &quot;Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs&quot; (2009). He was one of many stars in &quot;New York, I Love You&quot; (2008) and had a support role in &quot;Middle Men&quot; (2009). He did &quot;Mercy&quot; (2009), which his son Scott wrote and also starred in.

=== 2010s ===
Caan appeared in &quot;Henry&#x27;s Crime&quot; (2010), &quot;Detachment&quot; (2011), &quot;Small Apartments&quot; (2012), &quot;That&#x27;s My Boy&quot; (2012) with Adam Sandler, &quot;For the Love of Money&quot; (2012), and &quot;Blood Ties&quot; (2013). In 2012, Caan was a guest star on the re-imagined &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot; TV series, playing opposite his son, Scott Caan who played Danny &quot;Danno&quot; Williams. Caan was the chairman of an Internet company, Openfilm, intended to help up-and-coming filmmakers. In 2013, Caan portrayed Chicago mob kingpin Sy Berman in the Starz TV drama &quot;Magic City&quot;. He tried another regular series, the sitcom &quot;Back in the Game&quot; (2013) with Maggie Lawson.

Caan returned to film work with &quot;A Fighting Man&quot; (2013) and &quot;The Outsider&quot; (2014). In 2014, Caan appeared in the dramatic comedy &quot;Preggoland&quot;, playing a father who is disappointed with his daughter&#x27;s lack of ambition, but who becomes overjoyed when she (falsely) announces that she is pregnant. The film premiered in the Special Presentations section at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival The film had its U.S. premiere on January 28, 2015, at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.

== Personal life ==
Caan married four times. In 1961, he married Dee Jay Mathis; they divorced in 1966. They had a daughter, Tara (born 1964). Caan&#x27;s second marriage to Sheila Marie Ryan (a former girlfriend of Elvis Presley) in 1976 was short-lived; they divorced the following year. Their son, Scott Caan, also an actor, was born August 23, 1976.

Caan was married to Ingrid Hajek from September 1990 to March 1994; they had a son, Alexander James Caan, born 1991. In a 1994 interview with &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss claimed to be in a relationship with Caan during his marriage to Hajek in 1992, visiting him on the set of &quot;Flesh and Bone&quot; in Texas. Caan said his relationship with Fleiss was platonic.

Caan married Linda Stokes on October 7, 1995, they had two sons, James Arthur Caan (born 1995) and Jacob Nicholas Caan (born 1998). Caan filed for divorce in 2017, citing irreconcilable differences.

In 1994, Caan was arrested and released after being accused by a Los Angeles rap artist of pulling a gun on him.

Caan was a practicing martial artist. He trained with Takayuki Kubota for nearly 30 years, earning various ranks. He was a Master (6th Dan) of Gosoku-ryu Karate and was granted the title of Soke Dai by the International Karate Association.

He also took part in steer roping at rodeos and referred to himself as the &quot;only Jewish cowboy from New York on the professional rodeo cowboy circuit.&quot;

=== Alleged links to organized crime ===
During production of &quot;The Godfather&quot; in 1971, Caan was known to hang out with Carmine Persico, also known as &quot;The Snake&quot;, a notorious mafioso and later head of the Colombo crime family. Government agents briefly mistook Caan, who was relatively unknown at the time, as an aspiring mobster. Caan was also a friend of Colombo Family mobster Andrew Russo who is the godfather of Caan&#x27;s son Scott Caan.

In 1982, according to a conversation intercepted by the FBI between Caan and mobster Anthony Fiato, Caan had Fiato beat up actor Joe Pesci over Pesci failing to pay an $8,000 bill to a hotel.

Tributes to Caan were paid by Rob Reiner, Francis Ford Coppola, Barbra Streisand, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Talia Shire, Robert Duvall, Kathy Bates, Will Ferrell, and Marsha Mason, among others.

In 2021 Caan was announced to be a member of the cast of Coppola&#x27;s longtime passion project &quot;Megalopolis&quot;.

<doc id="411086" wikidata="Q2279899" url="?curid=411086" title="Good Charlotte (album)">
<text>Good Charlotte is the debut studio album by American rock band Good Charlotte, released on September 26, 2000, through Epic and Daylight Records. Despite receiving favorable reviews, the album undersold expectations, charting at number 185 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Little Things&quot; reached the top 30 on the Mainstream Top 40 and the Alternative Songs charts.

The band formed in 1996 with twin brothers Joel on vocals and Benji Madden on guitar, along with Billy Martin on guitar, Paul Thomas on bass and Aaron Escolopio on drums. A demo of &quot;Little Things&quot; received airplay from two radio stations and by early 2000, Good Charlotte had signed to Epic Records. Recording sessions with producer Don Gilmore for the debut album took place in four studios in California and New York.

&quot;Little Things&quot; was released as a single in July 2000; its music video for started getting airplay in November 2000. &quot;The Motivation Proclamation&quot; was released as the next single in January 2001. Between March and May 2001, the group went on tour with MxPx and appeared at HFStival, where a music video for &quot;Festival Song&quot; was filmed. After this, Escolopio left the group and was replaced by Nate Foutz of Vroom. Foutz remained with the group for six weeks before Dusty Bill replaced him. &quot;Festival Song&quot; was released a single in June 2001. The group participated in Warped Tour between June and August 2001. The album was subsequently certified silver in the UK and gold in the US.

==Background==

The band Good Charlotte was formed in Waldorf, Maryland, in 1995, after identical twin brothers Joel (vocals) and Benji Madden (guitar) had seen a Beastie Boys show. Following the brothers&#x27; graduation in 1997, instead of going to college they worked full-time on the band. The Madden brothers focused on getting the band signed, reading books and magazines that would aid them to achieve this goal. They made promotional packages and sent them to record labels. Joel Madden learned that the girl he took to homecoming was a sister of bassist Paul Thomas. Thomas met the brothers and was unimpressed with their performance skills. Soon afterwards, the brothers recruited their fellow high-school pupil Aaron Escolopio as a drummer and began playing clubs in the D.C. metro area. The Madden brothers moved to Annapolis, Maryland, and performed acoustic shows.

Guitarist Billy Martin went to one of these shows at the insistence of Jimi HaHa of Jimmie&#x27;s Chicken Shack. Martin became friends with the Madden brothers and let them move in with him after they were evicted from their apartment. Martin joined Good Charlotte after the trio learned they had a shared interest in the Australian rock band Silverchair and the break up of Martin&#x27;s band Overflow. They wrote new songs, and recorded and performed demos. The band began building a following by performing at HFStival in 1998, and support slots for Blink-182, Lit and Bad Religion. In 1999, Good Charlotte opened for Save Ferris in Philadelphia. After the performance, they left a demo of &quot;Little Things&quot; that soon got airplay on local radio station Y100. Benji Madden was certain of the song&#x27;s potential hit status with its high-school theme and the reality of its lyrics.

A Sony Music employee passed the band&#x27;s demo to regional promotion manager Mike Martinovich, who was impressed by the group&#x27;s writing ability and the autobiographical nature of the songs. He contacted talent manager Steve Feinberg, who flew to Annapolis to watch the group perform and later began working with them. Around the same time, WHFS also began playing the demo. As the track became a hit in the area, record labels began showing interest in Good Charlotte. By the end of 1999, the band went on an east-coast tour with Lit. Representatives from several major labels attended the New York City show of the tour. Starting in 2000, the band became a full-time touring act, performing support slots for Lit, Goldfinger, Sum 41 and Mest. Following a showcase in New York City, the band met with people in the music industry. Within a week, everyone that saw the performance wanted to sign them. David Massey, executive vice president of A&amp;R at Epic Records, signed the band to the label in May 2000.

==Recording and composition==
&quot;Good Charlotte&quot; was recorded mainly at Encore Studios in Los Angeles, California, and was produced by Don Gilmore who also acted as engineer and was assisted by Mauricio Iragorri and engineer Bob Jackson. Additional engineering was done by John Ewing Jr. The band wanted to work with Gilmore as they liked his work on Eve 6&#x27;s self-titled album (1998). Drums and bass were recorded at NRG Studios in Los Angeles with assistance from Matt Griffen in May 2000. Guitar and vocals were recorded in June with assistance from Paul Oliveira at Battery Studios in New York City. Martin, Thomas and Escolopio sang additional vocals on &quot;Little Things&quot; while HaHa contributed additional vocals on &quot;The Motivation Proclamation&quot;. Vocals were recorded with assistance from Pete Novack at Larrabee West, Los Angeles. Gilmore mixed most of the songs except &quot;Little Things&quot;, &quot;Change&quot; and &quot;Seasons&quot; at Encore Studios. He mixed &quot;Little Things&quot; at Battery Studios. &quot;Change&quot;, &quot;Seasons&quot; and &quot;Thank You Mom&quot; were mixed by Tom Lord-Alge at South Beach Studios in Miami, Florida. Vlado Meller mastered all of the tracks except for &quot;Little Things&quot; at Sony Music Studios in New York City. &quot;Little Things&quot; was mastered by Ted Jensen at Sterling Sound in New York City.

Musically, the album has been described as pop punk, drawing comparisons to Green Day, Smash Mouth, Eve 6 and Lit. All of the songs on &quot;Good Charlotte&quot; were written by the Madden brothers. Josh Ian wrote additional lyrics for &quot;Seasons&quot; and &quot;Let Me Go&quot;. Throughout the release are references to religion and God, who the group go as far to give acknowledgement to in the album&#x27;s booklet. &quot;Little Things&quot; makes reference to the Madden brothers&#x27; upbringing with their parents. One of the lines mentions their father abandoning them, which made Joel Madden uncomfortable. Benji Madden reasoned it worked within the context of the song. &quot;Waldorfworldwide&quot; is about the brothers&#x27; ambition and frustration; according to Joel Madden it was written when they had no money. According to Martin, &quot;The Motivation Proclamation&quot; talks about &quot;breaking out of a cycle if you&#x27;re depressed on something ... getting over it and going on&quot;. Joel Madden wrote &quot;Festival Song&quot;, which is about attending HFStival, a festival he grew up with. The album&#x27;s hidden track &quot;Thank You Mom&quot; is a tribute to the brothers&#x27; mother, who raised them after their father left, reminiscing on childhood memories.

==Release==
&quot;Little Things&quot; was released to modern rock radio stations on July 24, 2000. &quot;Good Charlotte&quot; was released on September 26, 2000, through Epic and Daylight Records. The Japanese edition included &quot;The Click&quot;, a cover of Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark&#x27;s &quot;If You Leave&quot; and a live, acoustic version of &quot;The Motivation Proclamation&quot; as bonus tracks. Sales of the album did not meet the label&#x27;s expectations and the group were nearly dropped from Epic. In October and November 2000, the group embarked on a US tour with Fenix TX, and another with MxPx that lasted until the end of the year. Also in November 2000, the music video for &quot;Little Things&quot; began receiving airplay on MTV. The video was filmed in Canada and was directed by Nigel Dick It depicts the band as troublemakers in high school; Joel Madden breaks into the principal&#x27;s office and talks into a microphone addressing &quot;Waldorf High School&quot;. The principal finds out and is angry with the band. He follows the microphone cable into the gym to find out who is causing trouble. The group are shown walking down a halfway and performing on a golf cart. Singer Mandy Moore, who appears as Madden&#x27;s girlfriend in the video, is then seen. The clip ends with an impromptu concert in the gym.

In December 2000, Good Charlotte appeared at HFSmas, the winter edition of HFStival. &quot;The Motivation Proclamation&quot; was released to modern rock radio stations on January 29, 2001. On March 1, 2001, &quot;Little Things&quot; was released as a single in Australia. The CD version includes &quot;The Click&quot; and &quot;Thank You Mom&quot; as extra tracks. Despite the lack of success of &quot;Little Things&quot;, Epic allowed the band to make a video for &quot;The Motivation Proclamation&quot;. The video was directed by Marc Webb; it depicts the band members lying on the ground, waking up one-by-one and beginning to playing together. Scenes from &quot;Undergrads&quot; are shown being played on a television. Between March and May 2001, the group supported MxPx on their headlining US tour. In April, the video for &quot;The Motivation Proclamation&quot; received airplay on video outlets. While on the MxPx tour, &quot;Good Charlotte&quot; was consistently selling 3,000 copies per week. As a result, the group wanted to make a live music video. At the end of May, the group performed at HFStival. During their set, a music video for &quot;Festival Song&quot; was filmed; it was directed by Webb. The video is a mini-documentary about the day. Members of Mest, New Found Glory and Linkin Park appear in the video.

Sometime afterwards, Escolopio left the group to join his brother&#x27;s band Wakefield. He was replaced by Nate Foutz of Vroom, who left the group after six weeks because Vroom signed a major label deal. Two days before the band went on tour, Dusty Bill was hired to play drums. The band gave him a copy of &quot;Good Charlotte&quot; and the following day, began practicing with him. &quot;Festival Song&quot; was released to modern rock radio stations on June 25, 2001. Between June and August 2001, Good Charlotte appeared on the Warped Tour. Between tour performances, the group performed at Y100 FEZtival.

On August 6, 2001, &quot;The Motivation Proclamation&quot; was released as a single in Australia. Following this, the band supported Blink-182 on their US tour before embarking on a tour of Australia in October. The group closed the year with a US headlining tour called the Uniting the States Tour, with support from Mest, the Movielife, and Midtown. In September 2004, the album was reissued as a two-CD package with &quot;The Young and the Hopeless&quot; (2002). It was reissued again in January 2010 in a box set alongside &quot;The Young and the Hopeless&quot;, &quot;The Chronicles of Life and Death&quot; (2004) and &quot;Good Morning Revival&quot; (2007).

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
AllMusic reviewer William Ruhlmann said, &quot;The beats come fast and furious, the simple guitar chords noisily fill the middle range, and the vocals are sung with snotty belligerence&quot;. He also said the lyrics touch upon &quot;standard-issue stuff&quot; with the only oddity being &quot;an occasionally expressed religious interest&quot;. &quot;Chart Attack&quot; wrote that the group sounds &quot;so much like a cross between Eve 6 and Lit that it&#x27;s frightening&quot;. The website said &quot;Good Charlotte&quot; is &quot;energized with angsty teenage punk, and though the lyrics are cynical, the music is peppy and autobiographical&quot;. David Hiltbrand of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said &quot;crosscurrents of anger and optimism&quot; appear throughout the album, and that the band has an &quot;astringent punk style&quot; combined with &quot;crafty pop underpinnings&quot;.

&quot;Melodic&quot; writer Johan Wippsson praised Gilmore&#x27;s &quot;very nice&quot; production and called the record a &quot;very nice punk-pop album with no really bad song&quot;. His only complaint was the lyrics, which he found to be a &quot;little bit to teenaged&quot; at times. Steve Schwadron of &quot;Ink 19&quot; wrote that the lyrics seemed &quot;very simplistic, and the music isn’t much more complicated&quot;, and apart from being &quot;good party music&quot;, he does not &quot;get much out of Good Charlotte&quot;. &quot;The Morning Call&quot; reviewer Joe Warminsky said the group &quot;spares nothing in its effort&quot; to join its contemporaries &quot;of lame pop-rock bands that populate non-hip-hop radio&quot;. He said the album &quot;wears thin quickly&quot; and that most of the songs are &quot;just plain shameless&quot;.

&quot;Good Charlotte&quot; charted at number one on the Catalog Albums chart, number 13 on the Heatseekers Albums chart and number 185 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It also reached number 12 in New Zealand and number 194 in the UK. It was later certified silver in the UK and gold in the US. &quot;Little Things&quot; charted in the US at number 23 on both the Mainstream Top 40 and Alternative Songs charts. The album charted in Australia at number 61. &quot;The Motivation Proclamation&quot; charted in Australia at number 67.

Two tracks were remixed for inclusion on the band&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Remixes&quot; (2008) compilation: &quot;Waldorfworldwide&quot; (retitled &quot;Los Angeles World Wide&quot;; by JNR SNCHZ) and &quot;Little Things&quot; (by Patrick Stump of Fall Out Boy). &quot;Little Things&quot;, &quot;The Motivation Proclamation&quot; and &quot;Festival Song&quot; were included on the band&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; (2010) compilation. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album at number 46 on their list of the 50 Greatest Pop-Punk Albums. In 2016, Benji Madden said of the album; &quot;We were young and excited kids who were full of dreams and still trying to figure out our musical identity&quot;. Later that year, Joel Madden said; &quot;[W]e didn’t over-think the pre-chorus, we didn’t think how we could make the bridge bigger, we wrote the songs until they were done. It’s more raw; the hope, the vibe and the spirit of that hopefulness has returned to the music.&quot; Jenna McDougall of Tonight Alive has expressed admiration for the album.

<doc id="411091" wikidata="Q2508898" url="?curid=411091" title="Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain">
<text>The golden age of Jewish culture in Spain was a Muslim ruled era of Spain, with the state name of Al-Andalus, lasting 800 years, whose state lasted from 711 to 1492 A.D. This coincides with the Islamic Golden Age within Muslim ruled territories, while Christian Europe experienced the Middle Ages.

Under Muslim rule, Jews were labeled as &quot;protected people&quot; — &quot;dhimmi&quot; which afforded them religious freedom and protection, exclusion from military service, offered many but not all rights. The coexistence in Muslim society allowed Jewish religious, cultural, and economic life to flourish into a parallel Golden Age.

The nature and length of this &quot;Golden Age&quot; has been debated, as there were at least three periods during which non-Muslims were oppressed. A few scholars give the start of the Golden Age as 711–718, the Muslim conquest of Iberia. Others date it from 912, during the rule of Abd al-Rahman III. The end of the age is variously given as 1031, when the Caliphate of Córdoba ended; 1066, the date of the Granada massacre; 1090, when the Almoravids invaded; or the mid-12th century, when the Almohads invaded.

==Historiography and nature of Golden Age==

Having invaded southern Spain and coming to rule in a matter of seven years, Islamic rulers were confronted with many questions relating to the implementation of Islamic rule of a non-Islamic society. The coexistence of Muslims, Jews, and Christians during this time is revered by many writers. Al-Andalus was a key center of Jewish life during the early Middle Ages.

María Rosa Menocal, a specialist in Iberian literature at Yale University, claims that &quot;tolerance was an inherent aspect of Andalusian society&quot;. Menocal&#x27;s 2003 book, &quot;The Ornament of the World&quot;, argues that the Jewish dhimmis living under the Caliphate were allowed fewer rights than Muslims but were still better off than in the Christian parts of Europe. Jews from other parts of Europe made their way to &quot;al-Andalus&quot;, where in parallel to Christian sects regarded as heretical by Catholic Europe, they were not just tolerated, but where opportunities to practise faith and trades were open without restriction save for the prohibitions on proselytisation and, sometimes, on synagogue construction.

Bernard Lewis takes issue with this view, calling it ahistorical and exaggerated. He argues that Islam traditionally did not offer equality or even pretend that it did and argues that it would have been both a &quot;theological as well as a logical absurdity.&quot; However, he also states:

Mark R. Cohen, Professor of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton University, in his &quot;Under Crescent and Cross&quot;, calls the idealized interfaith utopia a &quot;myth&quot; that was first promulgated by Jewish historians such as Heinrich Graetz in the 19th century as a rebuke to Christian countries for their treatment of Jews. This myth was met with the &quot;counter-myth&quot; of the &quot;neo-lachrymose conception of Jewish-Arab history&quot; by Bat Ye&#x27;or and others, which also &quot;cannot be maintained in the light of historical reality&quot;.

==Birth of the Golden Age==
Prior to 589, the Jewish population of Spain was tolerated by its Arian Visigoth rulers and placed on equal footing with the other ethnic and religious communities of the region. The Arians may have preferred the Jewish population to the Catholic one, as they did not fear political enmity from the Jews. The Visigoths were mainly indifferent towards Jews and allowed them to grow and prosper. After the Visigoths joined the Catholic Church, they placed ever greater economic burdens on the Jewish population, and later persecuted them severely. It is possible that Jews welcomed the Muslim Arab and mainly-Berber conquerors in the 8th century.

A period of tolerance dawned for the Jews of the Iberian Peninsula. Their number was considerably augmented by immigration from North Africa in the wake of the Muslim conquest. Immigrants from North Africa and the Middle East bolstered the Jewish population and made Muslim Spain probably the largest centre of contemporary Jews. Especially after 912, during the reign of Abd al-Rahman III and his son, Al-Hakam II, the Jews prospered culturally, and some notable figures held high posts in the Caliphate of Córdoba. Jewish philosophers, mathematicians, astronomers, poets and rabbinical scholars composed highly-rich cultural and scientific work. Many devoted themselves to the study of the sciences and philosophy, composing many of the most valuable texts of Jewish philosophy. Jews took part in the overall prosperity of Muslim Al-Andalus. Jewish economic expansion was unparallelled. In Toledo, after the Christian reconquest in 1085, Jews were involved in translating Arabic texts to the romance languages in the so-called Toledo School of Translators, as they had been previously in translating Greek and Hebrew texts to Arabic. Jews also contributed to botany, geography, medicine, mathematics, poetry and philosophy.

&#x27;Abd al-Rahman&#x27;s court physician and minister was Hasdai ibn Shaprut, the patron of Menahem ben Saruq, Dunash ben Labrat and other Jewish scholars and poets. In following centuries, Jewish thought flourished under famous figures such as Samuel Ha-Nagid, Moses ibn Ezra, Solomon ibn Gabirol and Judah Halevi. During &#x27;Abd al-Rahman&#x27;s term of power, the scholar Moses ben Hanoch was appointed rabbi of Córdoba, and as a consequence al-Andalus became the center of Talmudic study, and Córdoba the meeting-place of Jewish savants.

It was a time of partial Jewish autonomy. As &quot;dhimmis&quot;, &quot;protected non-Muslims&quot;, Jews in the Islamic world paid the jizya, which was administered separately from the zakat paid by Muslims. The jizya has been viewed variously as a head tax, as payment for non-conscription in the military (as non-Muslims were normally prohibited from bearing arms or receiving martial training) or as a tribute. Jews had their own legal system and social services. Monotheist religions of the People of the Book were tolerated but conspicuous displays of faith, such as bells and processions, were discouraged.

Comparing the treatment of Jews in the medieval Islamic world and medieval Christian Europe, the Jews were far more integrated in the political and economic life of Islamic society, and usually faced far less violence from Muslims, but there were some instances of persecution in the Islamic world as well from the 11th century. The Islamic world classified Jews and Christians as dhimmis and allowed Jews to practice their religion more freely than they could in Christian Europe.

Other authors criticize the modern notion of Al-Andalus being a tolerant society of equal opportunities for all religious groups as a &quot;myth&quot;. Jews were living in an uneasy coexistence with Muslims and Catholics, and the relationship between the groups was more often than not marked by segregation and mutual hostility. In the 1066 Granada massacre of much of the Jewish population of the city, the Jewish death toll was higher than in the much-publicized Christian pogroms in the Rhineland slightly later. The notable Jewish philosopher Moses Maimonides (1135–1204) was forced to flee from Al-Andalus to avoid conversion by the Almohads. In &quot;Letter to Yemen&quot;, Maimonides wrote:

==End of the Golden Age==
With the death of Al-Hakam II in 976, the caliphate began to dissolve, and the position of the Jews became more precarious under the various smaller kingdoms. The first major persecution was the 1066 Granada massacre, which occurred on 30 December in which a Muslim mob stormed the royal palace in Granada, crucified the Jewish Vizier Joseph ibn Naghrela and massacred many of the Jewish population of the city. According to one source, &quot;more than 1,500 Jewish families, numbering 4,000 persons, fell in one day&quot;. It was the first persecution of Jews on the Peninsula under Islamic rule.
Beginning in 1090, the situation deteriorated further with the invasion of the Almoravids, a puritan Muslim dynasty from Morocco. Even under the Almoravids, some Jews prospered although far more so under Ali III, than under his father, Yusuf ibn Tashfin. Among those who held the title of &quot;vizier&quot; or &quot;nasi&quot; in Almoravid times were the poet and physician Abu Ayyub Solomon ibn al-Mu&#x27;allam, Abraham ibn Meïr ibn Kamnial, Abu Isaac ibn Muhajar and Solomon ibn Farusal. The Almoravids were ousted from the peninsula in 1148, but the region was again invaded, this time by the even more puritanical Almohads.

During the reign of the Berber dynasties, many Jewish and even Muslim scholars left the Muslim-controlled portion of Iberia for the city of Toledo, which had been conquered in 1085 by Castille.

The major Jewish presence in Iberia continued until the Jews were forced to leave or to convert to Christianity in the Alhambra Decree of 1492 and a similar decree by Portugal in 1496.

<text>Georgi Dimitrov Mihaylov (; Bulgarian: Гео̀рги Димитро̀в Миха̀йлов) also known as Georgiy Mihaylovich Dimitrov (; 18 June 1882 – 2 July 1949), was a Bulgarian communist politician who served as leader of the Bulgarian Communist Party from 1933 to 1949, and the first leader of the Communist People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria from 1946 to 1949. From 1935 to 1943, he was the General Secretary of the Communist International.

Born in western Bulgaria, Dimitrov worked as a printer and trade unionist during his youth. He was elected to the Bulgarian parliament as a socialist during the First World War and campaigned against his country&#x27;s involvement in the conflict, which led to his brief imprisonment for sedition. In 1919, he helped found the Bulgarian Communist Party. Two years later, he moved to the Soviet Union and was elected to the executive committee of Profintern. In 1923, Dimitrov led a failed communist uprising against the government of Aleksandar Tsankov and was subsequently forced into exile. He lived in the Soviet Union until 1929, at which time he relocated to Germany and became head of the Comintern operations in central Europe.

Dimitrov rose to international prominence in the aftermath of the 1933 Reichstag fire trial. Accused of plotting the arson, he refused counsel and mounted an eloquent defence against his Nazi accusers, in particular Hermann Göring, ultimately winning acquittal. After the trial he relocated to Moscow and was elected head of Comintern.

In 1946, Dimitrov returned to Bulgaria after 22 years in exile and was elected prime minister of the newly founded People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria. He negotiated with Josip Broz Tito to create a federation of Southern Slavs, which led to the 1947 Bled accord. The plan ultimately fell apart over differences regarding the future of the joint country as well as the Macedonian question, and was completely abandoned following the fallout between Stalin and Tito. Dimitrov died after a short illness in 1949 in Barvikha near Moscow. His embalmed body was housed in the Georgi Dimitrov Mausoleum in Sofia until its removal in 1990; the mausoleum was demolished in 1999.

== Early life ==
The first of eight children, Dimitrov was born in Kovachevtsi, in present-day Pernik Province, to refugee parents from Ottoman Macedonia (a mother from Bansko and a father from Razlog). His father was a rural craftsman, forced by industrialisation to become a factory worker. His mother, Parashkeva Doseva, was a Protestant Christian, and his family is sometimes described as Protestant. The family moved to Radomir and then to Sofia. Several of Georgi&#x27;s siblings engaged in leftist political activities. His brother Nikola moved to Russia and joined the Bolsheviks in Odessa. In 1908, Nikola was arrested and exiled to Siberia where he died in 1916. Georgi&#x27;s brother Konstantin became a trade union leader but was killed in the First Balkan War in 1912. One of his sisters, Lena, married a future communist leader, Valko Chervenkov.
Dimitrov was sent to Sunday school by his mother, who wanted him to be a pastor, but he was expelled at age 12. He then trained as a compositor, and became active in the labor movement in the Bulgarian capital. By age 15, he was an active trade union member. By age 18 in 1900, he was secretary of the Sofia branch of the printers&#x27; union.

==Career==
Dimitrov joined the Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party in 1902. The following year he allied himself with Dimitar Blagoev and the faction that formed the Social Democratic Labour Party of Bulgaria (&quot;The Narrow Party&quot;, or &quot;tesniaks&quot;). In 1919, this party became the Bulgarian Communist Party when it affiliated with Bolshevism and the Comintern. From 1904 to 1923, Dimitrov was Secretary of the General Trade Unions Federation, which the Narrows controlled.

In 1911, he spent a month in prison for libeling an official of the rival Free Federation of Trade Unions, whom he accused of strike-breaking. In 1913, he was elected to the Bulgarian Parliament. He opposed government policies in the Balkan Wars and World War I. In 1915, he voted against awarding new war credits and denounced Bulgarian nationalism, for which he received short prison sentences. In summer 1917, after he intervened in defense of wounded soldiers who were being ordered by an officer to clear out of a first-class railway carriage, Dimitrov was charged with incitement to mutiny, stripped of his parliamentary immunity, and imprisoned on 29 August 1918. Released in 1919, he went underground and made two failed attempts to visit Russia, finally reaching Moscow in February 1921. He returned to Bulgaria later in 1921, but then travelled again to Moscow and was elected in December 1922 to the Executive Bureau of Profintern, the communist trade union international.
In June 1923, when Bulgarian Prime Minister Aleksandar Stamboliyski was deposed through a coup d&#x27;état, Dimitrov and Khristo Kabakchiev, the leading communists in Bulgaria at the time, resolved not to take sides, a decision condemned by the Comintern as a &quot;political capitulation&quot; brought on by the party&#x27;s &quot;dogmatic-doctrinaire approach&quot;. After Vasil Kolarov had been sent from Moscow to impose a change in the Bulgarian party line, Dimitrov accepted the Comintern&#x27;s authority. In September 1923, he and Kolarov led the failed uprising against the regime of Aleksandar Tsankov, which cost the lives of possibly five thousand communist supporters during the fighting and the reprisals which followed. Despite its failure, the attempt was approved by the Comintern, and secured the positions of Kolarov and Dimitrov – who escaped via Yugoslavia to Vienna – as the joint leaders of the Bulgarian CP.

The political struggle in Bulgaria intensified in 1925. Dimitrov&#x27;s only surviving brother, Todor, was arrested and killed that year by royal police. After the April 1925 St Nedelya Church assault, which was a terrorist bomb attack carried out by members of the Bulgarian CP, Dimitrov was tried &quot;in absentia&quot; in May 1926 and sentenced to death, although he had not approved the attack. Living under pseudonyms, he remained in the Soviet Union until 1929, when he was ousted from his Bulgarian CP leadership role by a faction of younger, more left-wing activists. Dimitrov then relocated to Germany where he was given charge of the Central European section of the Comintern. In 1932, he was appointed Secretary General of the World Committee Against War and Fascism, replacing Willi Münzenberg.

== Leipzig trial ==
Dimitrov was living in Berlin in early 1933 when Adolf Hitler and the Nazis took power. On the night of 27 February, the German parliament building, the Reichstag, was severely damaged in an arson attack. A Dutch communist, Marinus van der Lubbe, was found near the scene of the crime and presumed to be the culprit. Hitler quickly blamed a Communist conspiracy for the arson, and the Nazis proceeded to make mass arrests. On 9 March, Dimitrov was arrested based on the evidence of a waiter who claimed to have seen &quot;three Russians&quot; (in reality, Dimitrov and two other Bulgarians, Vasil Tanev, and Blagoy Popov, both of whom were members of the faction that had supplanted Dimitrov in the Bulgarian Communist Party) talking in a cafe with Van der Lubbe. Dimitrov would remain in Nazi detention until the following February. His diary entries during this period tended to be &quot;dry and elliptical, and occasionally obscure&quot; since he knew they would be subject to examination by his captors.

The Reichstag fire trial lasted from September to December 1933. Because it occurred at the Reich Supreme Court in Leipzig, it is often referred to as the Leipzig Trial. Dimitrov decided to refuse counsel and defend himself against his Nazi accusers, most famously Hermann Göring. Dimitrov used the trial as an opportunity to defend the Communist ideology. Explaining why he chose to speak in his own defense, Dimitrov said:
I admit that my tone is hard and grim. The struggle of my life has always been hard and grim. My tone is frank and open. I am used to calling a spade a spade. I am no lawyer appearing before this court in the mere way of his profession. I am defending myself, an accused Communist. I am defending my political honor, my honor as a revolutionary. I am defending my Communist ideology, my ideals. I am defending the content and significance of my whole life. For these reasons every word which I say in this court is a part of me, each phrase is the expression of my deep indignation against the unjust accusation, against the putting of this anti-Communist crime, the burning of the Reichstag, to the account of the Communists.

Dimitrov&#x27;s calm conduct of his defence, and the accusations he directed at his prosecutors, won him world renown. In Europe, a popular saying spread across the Continent: &quot;There is only one brave man in Germany, and he is a Bulgarian.&quot; Among those impressed with Dimitrov was the noted U.S. attorney Arthur Garfield Hays, co-founder of the American Civil Liberties Union. Hays attended the Leipzig Trial and devoted a chapter to it in his 1942 autobiography. In an oft-quoted passage, Hays wrote of Dimitrov:I have never seen such a magnificent exhibition of moral courage. The man was not only brave but reckless, and selflessly so. Whenever he got to his feet, he would by force of his personality place the court, the prosecutors, the German audience, and the Nazis on the defensive. This striking characterization was cited in multiple American newspaper reviews of Hays&#x27; book and helped introduce Dimitrov&#x27;s name throughout the U.S.

On 23 December 1933, the verdicts were read. While Van der Lubbe was found guilty and sentenced to death, the judge acquitted Dimitrov, Tanev, and Popov because of insufficient evidence to connect them to what the judge was convinced was a conspiracy to burn down the Reichstag. The three Bulgarians were expelled from Germany and sent to the USSR.

== Head of Comintern ==

When Dimitrov arrived in Moscow on 28 February 1934, he was encouraged by Joseph Stalin to end the practice of denouncing Social Democrats as &#x27;social fascists&#x27;, practically indistinguishable from actual fascists, and to instead promote &quot;united front&quot; tactics against the threat of European fascism. In April, as Dimitrov&#x27;s fame grew in the wake of the Leipzig Trial, he was appointed a member of the Executive of Comintern and of its political secretariat, in charge of the Anglo-American and Central European sections. He was being groomed to take control of the Comintern from two of the so-called &quot;Old Bolsheviks&quot;, Iosif Pyatnitsky and Wilhelm Knorin, who had held the position since 1923. Finally, in 1934, Stalin chose Dimitrov to head the international organization. At this point, Tzvetan Todorov writes, Dimitrov &quot;became part of the Soviet leader&#x27;s inner circle.&quot;

From 25 July to 20 August 1935, the 7th World Congress of the Communist International met in Moscow. Dimitrov was the dominant presence; he was elected the Comintern&#x27;s General Secretary. His impassioned anti-fascist speeches at the Congress were transcribed and published in a September 1935 pamphlet, &quot;The United Front Against Fascism&quot;, which went through numerous editions over the ensuing years.
During the Great Purge in the Soviet Union, Dimitrov knew about the mass arrests, but did almost nothing. In November 1937, he was told by Stalin to lure the German communist Willi Münzenberg to the USSR so that he could be arrested. Dimitrov did not object and did as he was told. He noted in his diary when Julian Leszczyński, Henryk Walecki, and several members of his staff were arrested, but again did nothing, though he did raise questions when the NKVD representative in Comintern, Mikhail Trilisser, was arrested.

== Leader of Bulgaria ==
In 1946, Dimitrov returned to Bulgaria after 22 years in exile. After a referendum abolished the monarchy in September, Bulgaria was declared a people&#x27;s republic. Later that year, he succeeded Kimon Georgiev as Prime Minister, though Dimitrov had already been the most powerful man in the country since the monarchy was abolished two months earlier. He retained his Soviet citizenship.

One of Dimitrov&#x27;s first acts as Prime Minister was to negotiate with Josip Broz Tito on the creation of a Federation of the Southern Slavs. The Bulgarian and Yugoslav Communist leaderships had been discussing this matter since November 1944. The idea was based on the fact that Yugoslavia and Bulgaria were the only two homelands of the Southern Slavs, and were separated from the rest of the Slavic world. The idea eventually resulted in the 1947 Bled accord, signed by Dimitrov and Tito, which called for abandoning frontier travel barriers, arranging for a future customs union, and having Yugoslavia unilaterally forgive Bulgarian war reparations. The preliminary plan for the federation included the incorporation of the Blagoevgrad Region (&quot;Pirin Macedonia&quot;) into the People&#x27;s Republic of Macedonia and the return of the Western Outlands from Serbia to Bulgaria. In anticipation of this, Bulgaria accepted teachers from Yugoslavia who started to teach the newly codified Macedonian language in the schools in Pirin Macedonia, and also issued an order that the Bulgarians of the Blagoevgrad Region should claim а Macedonian identity.

However, differences soon emerged between Dimitrov and Tito with regard to both the future joint country and the Macedonian question. Whereas Dimitrov envisaged a state where Yugoslavia and Bulgaria would be placed on an equal footing and Macedonia would be more or less attached to Bulgaria, Tito saw Bulgaria as a seventh republic in an enlarged Yugoslavia tightly ruled from Belgrade. Their differences also extended to the national character of the Macedonians; whereas Dimitrov considered them to be an offshoot of the Bulgarians, Tito regarded them as an independent nation of people who had nothing whatsoever to do with the Bulgarians. The initial tolerance for the Macedonization of Pirin Macedonia gradually grew into outright alarm.

By January 1948, Tito&#x27;s plans to annex Bulgaria and Albania had become an obstacle to policy of the Cominform and the other Eastern Bloc countries. In December 1947, Enver Hoxha and an Albanian delegation were invited to a high-level meeting in Bulgaria. Dimitrov was aware of the subversive activity of Koçi Xoxe and other pro-Yugoslav Albanian officials. He told Enver Hoxha during the meeting: &quot;Look here, Comrade Enver, keep the Party pure! Let it be revolutionary, proletarian and everything will go well with you!&quot;

After the initial rupture, Stalin invited Dimitrov and Tito to Moscow regarding the recent incident. Dimitrov accepted the invitation, but Tito refused, and sent his close associate Edvard Kardelj instead. The resulting rift between Stalin and Tito in 1948 gave the Bulgarian Government an eagerly-awaited opportunity of denouncing Yugoslav policy in Macedonia as expansionistic, and of revising its policy on the Macedonian question. The ideas of a Balkan Federation and a United Macedonia were abandoned, the Macedonian teachers were expelled and the teaching of Macedonian throughout the province was discontinued. At the 5th Congress of the Bulgarian Workers&#x27; Party (Communists), Dimitrov accused Tito of &quot;nationalism&quot; and hostility towards the internationalist communists, specifically the Soviet Union. Despite the fallout, Yugoslavia did not reverse its position on renouncing Bulgarian war reparations, as defined in the 1947 Bled accord.

==Personal life==
In 1906, Dimitrov married his first wife, Serbian emigrant milliner, writer and socialist Ljubica Ivošević, with whom he lived until her death in 1933. While in the Soviet Union, Dimitrov married his second wife, the Czech-born Roza Yulievna Fleishmann (1896–1958), who gave birth to his only son, Mitya, in 1936. The boy died at age seven of diphtheria. While Mitya was alive, Dimitrov adopted Fani, a daughter of Wang Ming, the acting General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party in 1931. He and his wife adopted another child, Boiko Dimitrov, born 1941.

==Death==
Dimitrov died on 2 July 1949 in the Barvikha sanatorium near Moscow. The speculation that he had been poisoned has never been confirmed, although his health seemed to deteriorate quite abruptly. The supporters of the poisoning theory claim that Stalin did not like the &quot;Balkan Federation&quot; idea of Dimitrov and his closeness with Tito.

After the funeral, Dimitrov&#x27;s body was embalmed and placed on display in Sofia&#x27;s Georgi Dimitrov Mausoleum. After the end of Communist rule in Bulgaria, his body was buried in Sofia&#x27;s central cemetery in 1990. His mausoleum was demolished in 1999.

<doc id="411100" wikidata="Q1094781" url="?curid=411100" title="Pelog">
<text>Pelog (, , ) is one of the essential tuning systems used in gamelan instruments that has a heptatonic scale. The other, older, scale commonly used is called &quot;slendro&quot;. &quot;Pelog&quot; has seven notes, but many gamelan ensembles only have keys for five of the pitches. Even in ensembles that have all seven notes, many pieces only use a subset of five notes, sometimes the additional 4th tone is also used in a piece like western accidentals.

==Etymology==
Pelog is a Javanese term for one of the scales in gamelan. In Javanese, the term is said to be a variant of the word &quot;pelag&quot; meaning &quot;fine&quot; or &quot;beautiful&quot;.

==Tuning==
Since the tuning varies so widely from island to island, village to village, and even among &quot;gamelan&quot;, it is difficult to characterize in terms of intervals. One rough approximation expresses the seven pitches of Central Javanese &quot;pelog&quot; as a subset of 9-tone equal temperament. An analysis of 27 Central Javanese gamelans by Surjodiningrat (1972) revealed a statistical preference for this system of tuning.

As in &quot;slendro&quot;, although the intervals vary from one gamelan to the next, the intervals between notes in a scale are very close to identical for different instruments within the same Javanese &quot;gamelan&quot;. This is not the case in Bali, where instruments are played in pairs which are tuned slightly apart so as to produce interference beating. The beating is ideally at a consistent speed for all pairs of notes in all registers, producing stretched octaves as a result. This contributes to the very &quot;agitated&quot; and &quot;shimmering&quot; sound of gamelan ensembles. In the religious ceremonies that contain &quot;gamelan&quot;, these interference beats are meant to give the listener a feeling of a god&#x27;s presence or a stepping stone to a meditative state.

Sundanese gamelan has its own &quot;pélog&quot; tuning. Both Javanese-like &quot;pélog&quot; and Sundanese pélog (&quot;degung&quot;) coexist in Sundanese music. Javanese-like pélog has the 2nd note more neutral (Javanese 2 [ro], Sundanese 4 [ti]) and Degung has the 1st note leaning (closer to Javanese 1 [ji], Sundanese 5 [la]). The Javanese pélog is only found in &quot;gamelan pélog&quot; instruments, while degung is found widely on any instrument, such as &quot;calung&quot;, &quot;angklung&quot;, and &quot;gamelan degung.&quot;

Notation equivalents for &quot;pélog&quot; in both Javanese and Sundanese notation:

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ji ro lu pat mo nem pi

5 4 3 -3 2 1 +5 la ti na ni mi da leu

==Usage==
===Java===
Although the full &quot;pelog&quot; scale has seven tones, usually only a five-tone subset is used (see the similar Western concept of mode). In fact, many gamelan instruments physically lack keys for two of the tones. Different regions, such as Central Java or West Java (Sunda), use different subsets. In Central Javanese gamelan, the &quot;pelog&quot; scale is traditionally divided into three &quot;pathet&quot; (modes). Two of these, called &quot;pathet nem&quot; and &quot;pathet lima&quot;, use the subset of 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6; the third, &quot;pathet barang&quot;, uses 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7. The remaining two notes, including 4 in every &quot;pathet&quot;, are available for embellishments on most instruments, but they do not usually appear on &quot;gendér&quot;, &quot;gambang&quot;, or interpunctuating instruments.

The notes of the &quot;pelog&quot; scale can be designated in different ways; In Central Java, one common way is the use of numbers (often called by their names in Javanese, especially in a shortened form. An older set uses names derived from parts of the body. Notice that both systems have the same designations for 5 and 6.

===Sunda (West Java)===
In Sunda, the notes of gamelan degung have one-syllable names. A peculiarity of Sundanese solfège is that scale degrees are given in descending order.
===Bali===
In Bali, all seven tones are used in &quot;gamelan semar pegulingan&quot;, &quot;gamelan gambuh&quot;, and &quot;gamelan semara dana&quot; (a seven-tone &quot;gamelan gong kebyar&quot; ensemble). All seven tones are rarely heard in a single traditional composition.

Like in the music of Java, five-tone modes are used, which are constructed with alternating groups of three and two consecutive scale degrees, each group being separated by a gap. Unlike Java, there are only five names for the notes, and the same five names are used in all modes. The modes all start on the note named &quot;ding&quot;, and then continue going up the scale to &quot;dong&quot;, &quot;deng&quot;, &quot;dung&quot; and &quot;dang&quot;. This means that the same pitch will have a different name in a different mode.

==== Classical modes ====

The three most common and well-known modes are &quot;selisir&quot;, &quot;tembung&quot; and &quot;sunaren&quot;. &quot;Selisir&quot; is the most often encountered, being the tuning of the popular &quot;Gamelan gong kebyar&quot;, and may be considered the &quot;default&quot; pelog scale.

Two other modes, &quot;baro&quot; and &quot;lebeng&quot;, are known from &quot;gambuh&quot; and &quot;semar pegulingan&quot;, but are rarely used and more loosely defined. &quot;Baro&quot; has at least four different interpretations; one common one (3-4-5-7-1, according to I Wayan Beratha and I Ketut Gede Asnawa) is shown below. &quot;Lebeng&quot; contains all seven tones, but only in &quot;semar pegulingan&quot;; in &quot;gambuh&quot; it is pentatonic, but has a more elusive character.

==== Other modes ====

With the advent of the &quot;gamelan semara dana&quot; and renewed interest in seven-tone music, a number of other modes have been discovered by extending the 3/2 rule to other possible positions. They fall into two groups: the &quot;pengenter&quot; modes and the &quot;slendro&quot; modes.

The two &quot;slendro&quot; modes, &quot;slendro gedé&quot; and &quot;slendro alit&quot; are named for their resemblance to &quot;slendro&quot; proper. In these modes, &quot;ding&quot; is often placed at the first note of a two-note sequence in the 3-2 pattern, reflecting common practice in &quot;slendro&quot; ensembles. &quot;Slendro gedé&quot; is associated with the tuning of gender wayang, while &quot;slendro alit&quot; is identified with the four-tone scale of gamelan angklung.

The &quot;pengenter&quot; modes were discovered as theoretical extrapolations by I Nyoman Kaler. They exist only in recent modern compositions.

<text>Winny (also known as WinNY) is a Japanese peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing program developed by Isamu Kaneko, a research assistant at the University of Tokyo in 2002. Like Freenet, a user must add an encrypted node list in order to connect to other nodes on the network. Users choose three cluster words which symbolize their interests, and then Winny connects to other nodes which share these cluster words, downloading and storing encrypted data from cache of these neighbors in a distributed data store. If users want a particular file, they set up triggers (keywords), and Winny will download files marked by these triggers. The encryption was meant to provide anonymity, but Winny also included bulletin boards where users would announce uploads, and the IP address of posters could be discovered through these boards. While Freenet was implemented in Java, Winny was implemented as a Windows C++ application.

The software takes its name from WinMX, where the M and the X are each advanced one letter in the Latin alphabet, to N and Y. Netagent published a survey in June 2018 suggesting that Winny was still the most popular p2p network in Japan ahead of Perfect Dark (P2P) and Share (P2P) with approximately 45,000 nodes connecting each day over Golden Week. The number of nodes on Winny appears to be holding steady compared with 2015.

Kaneko first announced Winny on the Download Software board of the 2channel (&quot;2ch&quot; for short) Japanese bulletin board site. Since 2channel users often refer to anonymous users by their post numbers, Kaneko came to be known as &quot;Mr. 47&quot; (&quot;47-Shi&quot;, or 47氏 in Japanese), or just &quot;47&quot;. 

After Winny&#x27;s development stopped, a new peer-to-peer application, Share, was developed to be a successor.

==Antinny==

Since August 2003, several worms called &quot;Antinny&quot; have spread on the Winny network.

Some versions of Antinny work as follows:
* Upload files from the host computer onto the Winny network.
* Upload screenshots onto an image board.
* Denial-of-service attack to a copyright protecting agency web site.

Some people have uploaded their information unwittingly from their computers because of Antinny. That information includes governmental documents, information about customers, and people&#x27;s private files. Once the information is uploaded, it is difficult to delete.

Recently, highly publicized cases of sensitive file uploading have come to light in Japan&#x27;s media. In particular, a defense agency was forced to admit that classified information from the Maritime Self Defense Force was uploaded by a computer with Winny software installed on it.

Following this, All Nippon Airways suffered an embarrassing leak of passwords for security-access areas in 29 airports across Japan. A similar incident occurred with JAL Airlines on 17 December 2005, after a virus originating from Winny affected the computer of a co-pilot.

Perhaps the largest Winny-related leak was that of the Okayama Prefectural Police Force, whose computer leaked data about around 1,500 investigations. This information included sensitive data such as the names of sex crime victims, and is the largest amount of information held by Japanese police to have ever leaked online.

==Arrests and court cases==

On November 28, 2003, two Japanese users of Winny, Yoshihiro Inoue, a 41-year-old self-employed businessman from Takasaki, Gunma Prefecture and an unemployed 19-year-old from Matsuyama, were arrested by the Kyoto Prefectural Police. They were accused of sharing copyrighted material via Winny and admitted to their crimes.

Shortly following the two users&#x27; arrests, Kaneko also had his home searched and had the source code of Winny confiscated by the Kyoto Police. On May 10, 2004, Kaneko was arrested for suspected conspiracy to encourage copyright infringement by the High-tech Crime Taskforce of the Kyoto Prefectural Police. Kaneko was released on bail on June 1, 2004. The court hearings started in September 2004 at Kyoto district court. On December 13, 2006, Kaneko was convicted of assisting copyright violations and sentenced to pay a fine of ¥1.5 million (about US$13,200). He appealed the ruling. On October 8, 2009, the guilty verdict was overturned by the Osaka High Court. On December 20, 2011, Kaneko was cleared of all charges after the Supreme Court of Japan agreed that the prosecution could not prove that he had any intention to promote the software for illegal use.

== In popular culture ==
Japanese heavy metal band, Maximum the Hormone referenced the software in their song &quot;A-L-I-E-N&quot; by satirically urging listeners to stop using the service in the lyrics.

<text>The Junction is a neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, that is near the West Toronto Diamond, a junction of four railway lines in the area. The neighbourhood was previously an independent city called West Toronto, that was also its own federal electoral district until amalgamating with the city of Toronto in 1909. The main intersection of the area is Dundas Street West and Keele Street. The Stockyards is the northeastern quadrant of the neighbourhood.

==History==
As with most Toronto neighbourhoods outside of the central downtown core, the area was primarily rural until the 1870s. John Scarlett was the first land owner and employer in the area and built his home &quot;Runnymede&quot; in 1838, near where Dundas Street West and St. John&#x27;s Road meet today. By 1817 he had acquired most of property that is now the Junction and much more to the north and west to the Humber River. From 1857 to 1876 the Carlton Race Course dominated the southeast of the neighbourhood. The race track was owned by the Keele family (William Conway Keele and his son Charles Keele). The track was the site of the first Queen&#x27;s Plate. Following the arrival of the railways in the 1880s, the old racetrack and surrounding area was developed by Daniel Webster Clendenan, who would be elected the first reeve of the village of West Toronto Junction, and first mayor of the town of Junction in 1889. The approximate locations of the two main straightaways of the track are now High Park Avenue and Pacific Avenue (between Glenlake Road and Annette Street).

The Village of West Toronto Junction was founded in 1884 at the intersection of Dundas and Keele Streets. In 1889, it merged with the nearby villages of Carlton and Davenport to the north-east to become the Town of West Toronto Junction. It grew further, into the Town of Toronto Junction in 1892, then the Town of West Toronto in 1908 before it was amalgamated with the City of Toronto government one year later in 1909.

The Junction was a manufacturing community that rose quickly during the late 19th century. Foundries, mills, furniture assembly, meat processing, nail and wire factories were established. Notable companies, such as Canada Packers, Canadian Cycle &amp; Motor Co., Campbell Milling Company and the Heintzman piano company set up in the area. Other firms came because land, labour and taxes were cheaper than in Toronto, and the Canadian Pacific established a major operation there, establishing yards from Keele Street as far west as Scarlett Road. In addition, the town acquired an official port of entry in the 1890s, allowing local businesses to clear their goods locally as opposed to using the downtown Toronto port. These factors also attracted many immigrant or second generation Irish Catholics to the area, many of whom moved there from then poor, crowded tenement housing in areas of the city such as Cabbagetown and Brockton Village during the 1880s. Many also came from working-class English industrial cities such as Birmingham and Manchester. They were soon followed by many from non-English speaking countries, including Italians, Poles, Macedonian and Croatian immigrants, many of whom worked in the meat industry.

The Junction was prone to booms and busts during its tumultuous history; while the period between 1888 and 1890 was a prosperous one, the period between 1893 and 1900 saw significant poverty in the area due to an economic recession. The Long Depression saw the closing of factories and the end to construction in the area, and the municipality could not support its citizens because of a large civic debt.

Pubs and taverns became permanent fixtures in The Junction, as was the case with many railway and factory workers&#x27; towns. By 1904, the behaviour of the Junction workers was so out of hand, leading the residents, led by Bill Temple, to vote for banning the sale of alcohol until 1998. It was a long and tough fight led by Vesuvio Pizzeria and Shoxs Sports Saloon to regain the right to again serve alcohol in the area and it was not until 2001 that the first drink was poured east of Keele Street at Shoxs Sports Saloon. This, along with the burial of electric distribution lines and other street and sidewalk improvements, is credited by many as the beginning of the revitalization of the Junction.

Toronto annexed The Junction in 1909 and the two have gradually grown together, though residents have retained their community identity and remained very loyal to the neighbourhood, despite further economic hardship. The commercial stretch of Dundas Street went into decline, attributed at least partly to the prohibition. The prohibition law dissuaded restaurants from establishing themselves there, and bars were not permitted.

The area between Keele Street, Runnymede Road, St. Clair, and the CP railway lines, was for many decades the location of the Ontario Stockyards. Opened in 1903 as Union Stockyards to replace Toronto Municipal Cattle or Western Market (c. 1877 at 677 Wellington Street West at Walnut Avenue). For a time, this was Canada&#x27;s largest livestock market and the centre of Ontario&#x27;s meat packing industry, and reinforced Toronto&#x27;s nickname as Hogtown. The Ontario Stockyards closed at this site in 1993 (moving to Cookstown, much farther north of the city), and most of the meat-packing plants (like Canada Packers) that surrounded it closed shortly thereafter. 

Much of the lands has been redeveloped with new housing and retail uses. The main Stockyards site is now the location of a large bloc of big-box stores, including Metro, Home Depot, Canadian Tire, Future Shop (became re-branded as Best Buy in 2015)), Rona, Staples, and Nations Fresh Foods, an Asian supermarket, along with several smaller stores. There are still some smaller meat-packing facilities in the area and the name &quot;Stockyards&quot; is still used for the area.

Since the early 1920s, the area by Dundas and St. John&#x27;s Road has been known as Little Malta (getting signs to that effect in the 1990s) with several Maltese-Canadian businesses present, as well as a distinctly Maltese church. The Maltese-Canadian community has partially spread out to Mississauga and other Toronto suburbs, but still has a visible presence in this area.

As a consequence of the local abattoirs and other industries which produced volumes of toxic waste, the residents of the neighbourhood are highly concerned about pollution issues, and the City of Toronto has put significant efforts into cleaning up former industrial sites.

== Boundaries ==
Today, the term &quot;The Junction&quot; is generally applied to the area north of Annette, south of St. Clair, and between Runnymede Road and the Canadian National Railway corridor to the east which intersects with the Canadian Pacific Railway corridor at West Toronto Diamond. Historically, the boundary lines cover a considerably larger area.

The City of West Toronto as annexed by Toronto in 1909 had a northern boundary well past St. Clair to Rowntree Avenue, an eastern boundary zig-zagging along the Canadian National tracks, a southern boundary of Bloor Street, and a western boundary as far as Jane Street in the southwest between Bloor and Annette. Since the 1920s, the commercial development on Bloor Street has caused the area between The Junction and Swansea to rise in prominence, and thus many current residents of the former Junction area identify more with Runnymede-Bloor West Village.

== Demographics ==
According to the 2006 Census Tract, the population for census tract 5350101 was 3136 (Statistic Canada, 2006). Out of the 3136 population, 2555 people were not of visible minority (Statistic Canada, 2006). 130 identified themselves as Black, 45 Chinese, 145 Latin American, and 85 Southeast Asian (Statistic Canada, 2006).

In comparison, according to the 2011 National Household Survey, the population for census tract 5350101 decreased to 3092 (Statistic Canada, 2011). Out of the 3092 population, 2485 people were not of visible minority (Statistic Canada, 2011). 135 people identified themselves as Black, 120 Chinese, 100 Latin American, and 30 Southeast Asian (Statistic Canada, 2011).

Not only has there been a slight decrease in population from 2006 to 2011, there has been a decrease in visible minorities living in census tract 5350101, as 100 Latin Americans lived in this area in 2011 in comparison to 145 Latin Americans living in the area in 2006, and 30 Southeast Asians were living in this area in 2011 in comparison to 85 in 2006 (Statistic Canada, 2006; Statistic Canada, 2011). However, there have been more people who identify themselves as Black living in the area in 2011 (135) than in 2006 (130), as well as Chinese (120) in 2011 versus (45) in 2006 (Statistic Canada, 2006; Statistic Canada, 2011). The Latin American population was the biggest visible minority in this area in 2006, but in 2011, the black population seemed to be the largest visible minority (Statistic Canada, 2006; Statistic Canada, 2011).

==Education==
The City of Toronto, including The Junction neighbourhood, is served by two secular school boards, and two Catholic school boards. The two secular school boards are the English first language Toronto District School Board, and the French first language Conseil scolaire Viamonde. The two Catholic school boards are the English first language Toronto Catholic District School Board, and the French first language Conseil scolaire de district catholique Centre-Sud. Elementary schools in The Junction operated by one of the four school boards include:

* Annette Street Public School - A public elementary school located at 265 Annette Street. The original east building was constructed in 1886 and the west wing was added in 1960. The school shares the facilities (including the library, gym, pool and playground) with High Park Alternative School. It also shares space with The Junction Daycare and the Toronto Parks and Recreation Department.
* High Park Alternative School - A public elementary school sharing space in the Annette Street Public School, it was founded in 1981.
* Indian Road Crescent Junior Public School - A public elementary school located at 285 Indian Road Crescent, east of Annette and Keele Streets. Indian Road Crescent serves students from Junior Kindergarten to Grade 6. The school population is approximately 330. It also shares space with Holland-Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation daycare.
* St Cecilia Catholic School - A Catholic public school located at 355 Annette Street. The present St. Cecilia Catholic School, at the corner of Annette Street and Evelyn Avenue, opened in 1914 with additions in 1918, 1954 and 1964. 
* St. Clair Avenue Public School - A public elementary school near Britannia Ave constructed in 1912 and demolished in the early 1990s. Townhouses now occupy the site.

== Recreation==

In 2009, the West Toronto Railpath opened, providing a direct link for pedestrians and cyclists from The Junction to the Dundas and Lansdowne area. There are plans to eventually extend the path farther south to the Liberty Village neighbourhood. The Junction Business Improvement Area hosts a variety of public events during the year including:

* The Junction Summer Solstice Festival (June) 
* Participates in the Toronto citywide Contact Photography Festival (May)

== In popular culture ==
* &quot;Murdoch Mysteries&quot;, a detective series based in and around Toronto in the early 1900s, made extensive references to the Junction and its place in the temperance movement in an episode of the show&#x27;s 9th season (&quot;The Local Option&quot;). Most of the story takes place either within the Junction or through characters based there and later interrogated in the main Toronto police buildings.

<text>Albert Eric Maschwitz OBE (10 June 1901 – 27 October 1969), sometimes credited as Holt Marvell, was an English entertainer, writer, editor, broadcaster and broadcasting executive.

==Life and work==

Born in Edgbaston, Birmingham, England, the son of a Lithuanian Jewish father, Eric Maschwitz was educated at Arden House preparatory school, Henley in Arden, Repton School and Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge.

As a lyricist, Maschwitz wrote, often credited to his pseudonym &quot;Holt Marvell&quot;, the screenplays of several successful films in the 1930s and 1940s, but is perhaps best remembered for his lyrics to 1940s popular songs such as &quot;A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square&quot; (music by Manning Sherwin) and &quot;These Foolish Things&quot; (music by Jack Strachey, reinterpreted in 1973 by Bryan Ferry on his first solo album of the same name). According to the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, Maschwitz had a brief romantic liaison with British cabaret singer Jean Ross, and their relationship inspired the lyrics for &quot;These Foolish Things&quot;. (Other sources have suggested that either Maschwitz&#x27;s wife Hermione Gingold or American actress Anna May Wong inspired the lyrics, but Maschwitz&#x27;s autobiography cites &quot;fleeting memories of [a] young love.&quot;)

Maschwitz started his stage acting career in the early 1920s, playing Vittoria in the first successful modern production of Webster&#x27;s &quot;The White Devil&quot; (Marlowe Society, Cambridge ADC Theatre, 1920). He joined the BBC in 1926. His first radio show was &quot;In Town Tonight&quot;. While at the BBC, he wrote a radio operetta &quot;Goodnight Vienna&quot;, with the popular song of the same title co-written by George Posford. In 1932, it was adapted as a film, &quot;Goodnight, Vienna&quot;, starring Anna Neagle.

Between 1927 and 1933, Maschwitz was the editor of the weekly broadcast listings magazine &quot;Radio Times&quot;. Under contract to MGM in Hollywood from 1937, he co-wrote the adaptation of &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot;, made by MGM-British, for which he shared an Academy Award nomination.

From August 1939, he was a postal censor in Liverpool. From November 1939, he served with the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS)/MI-6 D Section (sabotage). In 1940, he briefly worked to establish a resistance organization in Beverley, Yorkshire, and for Army Welfare in London before being assigned to the Special Operations Executive (SOE). In 1940 he was commissioned into the Intelligence Corps. He was then sent to New York City to work for the British Security Coordination (BSC). In 1942, he returned to London, briefly supervising radio programmes for the troops. He then transferred to the Political Warfare Executive (PWE). He ended the war as chief broadcasting officer with the 21st Army Group, leaving the army as a lieutenant-colonel. Maschwitz, along with Major John MacMillan (members of &quot;No 1 Field Broadcasting Unit&quot;), was responsible for taking over the &quot;Reichssender Hamburg&quot; on 3 May 1945. 

This requisition enabled the British occupation troops to start broadcasting programmes for their soldiers in northern Germany, and was the nucleus for the British Forces Network (BFN), inaugurated with Maschwitz&#x27;s help in July 1945, eventually to become the British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS).

In 1947, Maschwitz became chairman of the Songwriters&#x27; Guild of Great Britain, which was founded by Ivor Novello, Sir Alan Herbert, Eric Coates, Haydn Wood, Richard Addinsell and others, for the encouragement and protection of British popular music. He was the first Vice Chair and Chairman from July 1948 for one year, and again between December 1954 and April 1958.

In 1958, near the start of the BBC/ITV ratings wars, he rejoined the BBC as Head of Television Light Entertainment. 

Maschwitz left to join the rival ITV in 1963. During the course of his varied entertainment career, Maschwitz also adapted French comedies such as &quot;Thirteen For Dinner&quot;; wrote the book and lyrics for numerous musicals, amongst them &quot;Balalaika&quot;, &quot;Summer Song&quot;, which used the music of Dvorak, &quot;Happy Holiday&quot; (based on Arnold Ridley&#x27;s play &quot;The Ghost Train&quot;), and &quot;Zip Goes a Million&quot;, which was written specially for George Formby; and he was the creator of the radio series &quot;Café Collette&quot;. He also edited the &quot;Radio Times&quot;, and turned his hand to the detective novel: &quot;Death at Broadcasting House&quot;, co-written with Val Gielgud and published in 1931, revolves around a radio play disrupted by the murder of one of the cast.

Maschwitz was married twice: first to Hermione Gingold, who was granted a divorce in 1945, and then immediately to Phyllis Gordon, they lived at 12 Dorset House, Gloucester Place, London NW1. She remained his wife until his death at an Ascot Nursing Home in Sunninghill, Berkshire. 

His autobiography, &quot;No Chip On My Shoulder&quot;, was published by Herbert Jenkins in 1957.

He was created an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1936.

<text>Sidney Costantino, Baron Sonnino (11 March 1847 – 24 November 1922) was an Italian statesman, 19th prime minister of Italy and twice served briefly as one, in 1906 and again from 1909 to 1910. He also was the Italian minister of Foreign Affairs during the First World War, representing Italy at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference.

==Early life==
Sonnino was born in Pisa to an Italian Jewish father, Isacco Saul Sonnino, who converted to Anglicanism, and a Welsh mother, Georgina Sophia Arnaud Dudley Menhennet. He was raised as an Anglican by his family. His grandfather had emigrated from Livorno to Egypt, where he had built up an enormous fortune as a banker. As a young man, Sonnino suffered from a severe case of unrequited love, which badly damaged his self-esteem. In a typical entry in his diary, Sonnino wrote: &quot;Who can and should love this nonentity lacking all physical and moral attraction?&quot; To make up for his distress when the object of his affection married someone else, Sonnino took to long solitary walks and threw himself obsessively into work as he sought career success as a sort of consolation prize for his broken heart.

After graduating in law in Pisa in 1865, Sonnino became a diplomat and an official at the Italian embassies in Madrid, Vienna, Berlin, Paris and Saint Petersburg from 1866 to 1873. His family lived at the Castello Sonnino in Quercianella, near Livorno. He retired from the diplomatic service in 1873.

In 1876, Sonnino travelled to Sicily with Leopoldo Franchetti to conduct a private investigation into the state of Sicilian society. In 1877, the two men published their research on Sicily in a substantial two-part report for the Italian Parliament. In the first part, Sonnino analysed the lives of the island&#x27;s landless peasants. Leopoldo Franchetti&#x27;s half of the report, &quot;Political and Administrative Conditions in Sicily&quot;, was an analysis of the Mafia in the 19th century that is still considered authoritative today. Franchetti would ultimately influence public opinion about the Mafia more than anyone else until Giovanni Falcone, over 100 years later. &quot;Political and Administrative Conditions in Sicily&quot; is the first convincing explanation of how the Mafia came to be.

In 1878, Sonnino and Franchetti started a newspaper, &quot;La Rassegna Settimanale&quot;, which changed from weekly economic reviews to daily political issues.

==Early political career==
Sonnino was elected in the Italian Chamber of Deputies for the first time in the general elections in May 1880, from the constituency of San Casciano in Val di Pesa. He belonged to the chamber to September 1919 from the XIV to XXIV legislature and supported universal suffrage. Sonnino soon became one of the leading opponents of the Liberal Left. As a strict constitutionalist, he favoured a strong government to resist the pressure of special interests, which made him a conservative liberal.

In December 1893, he became Minister of Finance (December 1893 – June 1894) and Minister of the Treasury (December 1893 – March 1896) in the government of Francesco Crispi and tried to solve the Banca Romana scandal. Sonnino envisaged establishing a single bank of issue, but the main priority of his bank reform was to rapidly solve the financial problems of the Banca Romana and to cover up the scandal that involved the political class, rather than to design a new national banking system. The newly established Banca d&#x27;Italia was the result of a merger of three existing banks of issue (the Banca Nazionale and two banks from Tuscany). Regional interests were still strong, which caused the compromise of the plurality of note issuance with the &quot;Banco di Napoli&quot; and the &quot;Banco di Sicilia&quot; and the provision for tighter state control.

As Minister of the Treasury, Sonnino restructured public finances, imposed new taxes and cut public spending. The budget deficit was sharply reduced from 174 million lire in 1893–94 to 36 million in 1896–97. After the fall of the Crispi government as a result of the lost Battle of Adwa in March 1896, he served as the leader of the opposition conservatives against the liberal Giovanni Giolitti. In January 1897, Sonnino published an article, &quot;Torniamo allo Statuto&quot; (Let&#x27;s go back to the Statute), in which he sounded the alarm about the threats that the clergy, the republicans and the socialists posed to liberalism. He called for the abolition of the parliamentary government and the return of the royal prerogative to appoint and to dismiss the prime minister without consulting parliament, which he considered to be the only possible way to avert the danger. In 1901, he founded a new major newspaper, &quot;Il Giornale d&#x27;Italia&quot;.

==Opposition and Prime Minister==
In response to the social reforms presented by Prime Minister Giuseppe Zanardelli in November 1902, Sonnino introduced a reform bill to alleviate poverty in southern Italy that provided for a reduction of the land tax in Sicily, Calabria and Sardinia; the facilitation of agricultural credit; the re-establishment of the system of a perpetual lease for smallholdings (emphyteusis) and the dissemination and the enhancement of agrarian contracts to combine the interests of farmers with those of the landowners. Sonnino criticised the usual approach to solve the crisis through public works: &quot;to construct railways where there is no trade is like giving a spoon to a man who has nothing to eat.&quot;

Sonnino&#x27;s uncompromising severity towards others long proved to be an obstacle to forming his own government. Nevertheless, Sonnino served twice briefly as prime minister. On 8 February 1906, Sonnino formed his first government, which lasted only three months. On 18 May 1906, after a mere 100 days, he was forced to resign. He proposed major changes to transform Southern Italy, which provoked opposition from the ruling groups. Land taxes were to be reduced by one third except for the largest landowners. He also proposed the establishment of provincial banks and subsidies to schools. His reforms provoked opposition from the ruling groups, and he was succeeded by Giovanni Giolitti.

On 11 December 1909, Sonnino formed his second government with a strong connotation to the centre-right, but it did not last much longer and fell on 21 March 1910.

==First World War==

After the July Crisis, Sonnino initially supported maintaining the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary in 1914. He firmly believed that Italian self-interest entailed participation in the war, with its prospect of Italian territorial gains as a completion of Italian unification. However, after becoming Foreign Minister in November 1914 in the conservative government of Antonio Salandra and realising that it was unlikely to secure Austro-Hungarian agreement to concede territories to Italy, he sided with the Triple Entente of the United Kingdom, France and Russia, and he sanctioned the secret Treaty of London in April 1915 to fulfil Italian irredentist claims. Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915. During the talks, Sonnino omitted to include the largely Italian-speaking Austrian city of Fiume (modern Rijeka, Croatia) into the lands that were to go to Italy, an omission that he later would regret in 1919.

Sonnino followed what he called a &quot;Bismarckian&quot; foreign policy under which all that mattered was &quot;sacro egoismo&quot; (&quot;sacred egoism&quot;). The term &quot;sacro egoismo&quot; as the guiding principle of his foreign policy was Sonnino&#x27;s way of saying that the interests of the Italian state were to be pursued via a ruthless policy of &quot;realpolitik&quot;. Sonnino felt no great animosity towards the Austrian empire and no great love for the Allies, and only favoured intervening on the Allied side because the French, British and Russian diplomats he was talking with were willing to promise Italy more than the Austrian and German diplomats. Sonnino admitted in private that he would have favoured having Italy enter the war on the side of the Central Powers if only their diplomats had promised more than the Allied diplomats. The Australian historian R. J. B. Bosworth wrote it was not true that Italy entered the war in 1915 because of the Italian cabinet was &quot;stumbling over the brink into the boiling cauldron of war&quot;, but rather as an act of cold calculation by Salandra and Sonnino to achieve what they viewed as rightful Italian national interests. Bosworth wrote that the only way that Italy&#x27;s entry in the First World War can be seen as a mistake was the belief by Salandra and Sonnino that Italy would be able to swiftly defeat the Austrian empire as the both prime minister and the foreign minister believed that the war would be over by Christmas 1915. 

In October 1917, the &quot;Regio Esercito&quot; was badly defeated by an Austro-German force in the Battle of Caporetto, and for a moment it appeared possible that Italy was going to be knocked out of the war. In order to encourage the Slovenes, Croats and Serbs serving in the Imperial Austrian and Royal Hungarian Army to desert, Sonnino endorsed the idea of uniting all of the South Slav peoples into a state to be called Yugoslavia (&quot;the land of the South Slavs&quot;). Once the crisis caused by Capretto passed and it became clear that Italy was not going to be defeated after all, Sonnino performed a volte-face on the issue of Yugoslavia and reverted back to demanding all of the lands promised by the Treaty of London should go to Italy. In December 1917, the new Bolshevik government of Vladimir Lenin published all of the secret treaties signed by Imperial Russia and in this way the Treaty of London came to be public knowledge. Sonnino was greatly upset at the Bolsheviks for publishing the Treaty of London, especially as the related diplomatic correspondence to the negotiations made him look petty and selfish as he demanded various parts of the Austrian and Ottoman empires as the reward for entering the war on the Allied side. Sonnino sought to explain away the Treaty of London by arguing that he had demanded too much with the intention of bargaining away the gains made by the Treaty of London in exchange for territory elsewhere. However, once the terms of the Treaty of London came to be public knowledge, Sonnino found himself trapped as Italian nationalists argued that given Italy&#x27;s staggering heavy losses in the war that it would be a betrayal of the war dead to settle for anything less than what the terms of the Treaty of London had promised. 

In March 1918, Germany launched Operation Michael, an offensive that marked the beginning of the &quot;Kaiserschlacht&quot; (&quot;Emperor&#x27;s Battle&quot;), the final offensive in France intended to win the war for the &quot;Reich&quot;. In response to the initial success of the &quot;Kaiserschlacht&quot; with the British and French hard pressed, the Allied armies were finally unified into a Supreme Command under Marshal Ferdinand Foch. Sonnino objected strenuously to a Supreme Command with the control of all the Allied armies, arguing that it was humiliatingly that King Victor Emmanuel III who as King of Italy was the Supreme Commander of all the Italian forces should be subjected to the authority of a French Marshal. In response to the &quot;Kaiserschlacht&quot; with the German Army advancing menacingly close to Paris, Foch ordered the &quot;Regio Esercito&quot; to go on the offensive again with the hope of distracting the Germans who would have to come to the aid of their Austrian allies. The two most senior commanders of the &quot;Regio Esercito&quot;, Armando Diaz and Pietro Badoglio, both objected to Foch&#x27;s orders, saying the &quot;Regio Esercito&quot; had been badly mauled at Caporetto and to go on the offensive again would risk &quot;another Caporetto&quot;. The way that the Italians refused to go on the offensive in the spring of 1918 when the British and French were being hard-pressed on the Western Front greatly alienated the other Allied leaders. In June 1918, the Austrians went on the offensive and were defeated at the Second Battle of the Piave River. The Italian victory at Piave raised the stock of Italy with the Allied leaders, but the refusal of the Italians to follow up their victory with an offensive again strained relations with the Allies. In the fall of 1918 when became clear that Germany was going to lose the war and that the Austrian empire was collapsing, Sonnino pressed very strongly for the &quot;Regio Esercito&quot; to go on the offensive as he argued that another Italian victory would help Italy achieve what had been promised in the Treaty of London. In October, the offensive that Sonnino had lobbied for was launched and resulted in the Italian victory at the Battle of Vittorio Veneto.

==Paris Peace Conference, 1919==

He remained Foreign Minister in three consecutive governments and represented Italy at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference with Prime Minister Vittorio Emanuele Orlando. In January 1919, just before the conference started, the American president Woodrow Wilson paid the first visit by a U.S. president to Italy, where he was welcomed as a hero in Rome. Sonnino was less welcoming as he wrote that he was &quot;disgusted&quot; when Wilson told him that he was sincere about having national self-determination to be the basis of the peace. The Italians had broken the American diplomatic codes, and Sonnino was much offended when he learned that the State Department had debated the merits of having Wilson ask for Sonnino to be dropped from the Italian cabinet during his visit to Rome. Orlando had favoured having Italy renounce its claims to Dalmatia and the Dodecanese archipelago in exchange for American support for Italy annexing the rest of the lands promised by the Treaty of London, but Sonnino chose to take the maximalist position of demanding all of the lands promised by the Treaty of London. However, Sonnino went to Paris, promising in public that national self-determination was to be the basis of the post-world order without being opposed in private, a sleight-of-hand argument that Wilson at first took at face value.

Sonnino defended the literal application of the Treaty of London and opposed a policy of self-determination for the peoples in the former Austro-Hungarian territories. King Victor Emmanuel III chose not to impose clear guidelines on the Italian delegation out of the fear that either Orlando or Sonnino might resign in protest, which would leave the king with the responsibility of overseeing the formation of a new government, a duty that king wished to avoid. Victor Emmanuel was close to the generals of the &quot;Regio Esercito&quot;, who advised against annexing Dalamatia under the grounds that garrisoning it would represent an intolerable financial burden on the Italian state. The Chief of the General Staff, Armando Diaz, was more interested in African expansion. In a memo, he called for bringing the interior of Libya under Italian control (something not finally achieved until 1932), the expansion of the colony of Italian Somaliland likewise into the interior; for Britain and France to cede their colonies of British Somaliland and French Somaliland to Italy; and for the peacemakers in Paris to accept &quot;&quot;our unique influence&quot; in Ethiopia&quot; (emphasis in the original). However, the king did not wish to appear &quot;unpatriotic&quot; by dismissing Sonnino and instead ordered the Italian delegation to secure as much of Italy&#x27;s &quot;just aspirations&quot; as possible in Paris. The vague nature of the king&#x27;s mandate with the orders to secure Italy&#x27;s &quot;just aspirations&quot; allowed Sonnino and Orlando to pursue different policies at the Paris peace conference as Orlando was more open to compromises with Wilson than Sonnino.

Wilson had stated that national self-determination was to be the basis of the peace. However, Wilson supported per the Treaty of London the Italian claim to have the Brenner Pass as the new Italian-Austrian frontier and for Italy to annex the Austrian province of South Tyrol despite the fact that South Tyrol had a German majority. Sonnino often argued to Wilson that because Italy lost half-million killed in the war that felt the Allies had an obligation to fulfil all of the terms of the Treaty of London. Sonnino&#x27;s cold and aloof personality made him few friends at the conference, and his unwillingness to lobby the other delegates, which he considered to be beneath him, won him no allies at the conference. Sonnino&#x27;s arguments were described as contradictory and inept. On one hand, he claimed Fiume under the grounds of national self-determination, arguing the majority of the people in Fiume were Italian even through the Treaty of London did not assign Fiume to Italy while on the other hand he claimed Dalmatia and Istria under the grounds that the Treaty of London had assigned those areas to Italy despite the fact that the majority of the people in Dalmatia and Istria were Croats and Slovenes respectively who did not want to join Italy. 

Orlando&#x27;s inability to speak English and his weak political position at home allowed Sonnino to play a dominant role. Their differences proved to be disastrous during the negotiations. Orlando was prepared to renounce territorial claims for Dalmatia to annex Rijeka (or Fiume, as the Italians called the town), a major seaport on the Adriatic Sea, but Sonnino was not prepared to give up Dalmatia. Italy ended up claiming both but got none because of strong opposition to the Italian demands by US President Woodrow Wilson, who had a policy of national self-determination. In point IX of Wilson&#x27;s 14 Points, he promised that the post-war frontiers of Italy &quot;should be effected along clearly recognisable lines of nationality&quot;, and Wilson intended to apply that point in regards to Italian-Yugoslav frontier. On 24 April 1919, Orlando and Sonnino along with the rest of the Italian delegation walked out of the Paris peace conference in protest over the unwillingness of Wilson to support applying the Treaty of London plus adding Fiume. The Italian delegation were welcomed as heroes in Rome, but were soon forced to return to Paris when it became clear that the peace conference would continue without them and that Italy would have even less chance of achieving its ambitions out of the peace conference. Sonnino stubbornly maintained that Italy was entitled to a larger share of Asia Minor than it was promised under the Treaty of London, and received a promise that Italy would have a larger occupation zone in what is now southwestern Turkey. The belief that Sonnino was seeking to add the city of Smyrna (modern Izmir, Turkey) where slightly less than one-half of the population was Greek-speaking, to the Italian occupation zone led directly to the Greek prime minister Eleftherios Venizelos ordering the Greek army to occupy Smyrna in May 1919, which set off the Greek-Turkish war. Bosworth argued that given the antipathy of Wilson that Sonnino did in fact do fairly well at the Paris peace conference as he won for Italy the Austrian province of South Tyrol (modern Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol), the ethnically mixed city of Trieste and parts of Istria where Slovenes were in the majority.

==Later life==
After the territorial ambitions of Italy towards Austria-Hungary had to be substantially reduced, Orlando&#x27;s government resigned in June 1919. That was the end of Sonnino&#x27;s political career, and he did not participate in the elections in November 1919. He was nominated senator in October 1920 but did not actively participate. Sonnino died suddenly on 24 November 1922 in Rome after he had suffered an apoplectic stroke.

==Legacy==
Known as the &quot;silent statesman of Italy&quot;, he could speak five languages fluently. Sonnino&#x27;s main aims were to revive southern Italy economically and morally and to fight illiteracy. He never married.

The only Protestant leader in Italian politics, Sonnino was described as &quot;decidedly British in manner and thought&quot; and &quot;the great puritan of the Chamber, the last uncorrupted man&quot;. His stern intransigent moralism made him a difficult man, and although his integrity was universally respected, his closed and taciturn personality gained him few friends in political circles.

A &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary described Sonnino as an intellectual aristocrat, a great financier and an accomplished scholar with little talent for popularity whose greatness would have been unmistakable in the days of absolute monarchy. He was further portrayed as a very able diplomat who belonged to the &quot;old&quot; diplomacy with an undeserved prominence at the Paris Peace Conference as the typical imperialistic annexationist although the diplomatic rules had changed.

According to the historian R. J. B. Bosworth, &quot;Sidney Sonnino, who was Foreign Minister from 1914 to 1919, and with a personal reputation, perhaps deserved, for honesty in all his dealings, has strong claims to have conducted Italy&#x27;s least successful foreign policy.&quot;

==Trivia==
On 16 April 1909, Wilbur Wright took Sonnino on a flight at Centocelle field, Rome, making Sonnino one of the earliest statesmen to fly in an aeroplane.

<doc id="411113" wikidata="Q407339" url="?curid=411113" title="Nepheline">
<text>Nepheline, also called nephelite (), is a rock-forming mineral in the feldspathoid groupa silica-undersaturated aluminosilicate, Na3KAl4Si4O16, that occurs in intrusive and volcanic rocks with low silica, and in their associated pegmatites. It is used in glass and ceramic manufacturing and other industries, and has been investigated as an ore of aluminium.

== Description and properties ==
Nepheline crystals are rare and belong to the hexagonal system, usually having the form of a short, six-sided prism terminated by the basal plane. The crystals appear to have more symmetry than they actually possess, but unsymmetrical etched figures produced artificially on the prism faces indicate that the crystals are and , the only element of symmetry being a polar hexad axis. Nepheline is found in compact, granular aggregates, and can be white, yellow, gray, green, or reddish. Its hardness on the Mohs scale is 5.5 to 6, and its specific gravity 2.60–2.65. It is often translucent with a greasy luster.

The low index of refraction and the feeble double refraction in nepheline are nearly the same as in quartz; but since the sign of the double refraction is negative in nepheline, while it is positive in quartz, the two minerals are readily distinguished under the microscope. An important determinative character of nepheline is the ease with which it is decomposed by hydrochloric acid, with separation of gelatinous silica (which may be readily stained by coloring matters) and cubes of salt. For this reason, a clear crystal of nepheline becomes cloudy when immersed in acid.

The mineral is prone to alteration to zeolites (especially natrolite), sodalite, kaolin, or compact muscovite.

==Structure and composition==
The aluminosilicate backbone of nepheline has a fairly open structure of interlocked six-member rings. This resembles the structure of tridymite, with aluminum substituting for every other silicon atom. This structure produces one nearly hexagonal interstitial site and three irregular interstitial sites per unit cell. In ideal nepheline, the hexagonal sites are occupied by potassium ions and the irregular sites by smaller sodium ions, yielding an atomic ratio of sodium to potassium of 3:1. This corresponds to an ideal weight percentage of K2O of 8.1% The range of compositions seen in natural nepheline is 3% to 12% K2O. Small amounts of calcium may be present as well.

At elevated temperature, nepheline forms a complete solid solution series with kalsilite, KAlSiO4. At temperatures below about , there is a wide miscibility gap between nepheline and kalsilite, similar to the miscibility gap between microcline and albite. A composition falling in this gap will experience exsolution as it cools, where nepheline and kalsilite separate into separate microscopic layers (lamellae).

==Occurrence==
Nephelinite is a rock-forming mineral found in silica-poor igneous rocks. These include nepheline syenite, foidite, and phonolite. It is often found along with leucite, sodalite, potassium feldspars, and sodium-rich plagioclase, amphiboles, or pyroxenes, but almost never in association with quartz. Notable outcrops of nepheline-bearing rocks are found on the Kola Peninsula; in Norway and South Africa; and at Litchfield, Maine; Magnet Cove, Arkansas; and Beemerville, New Jersey, in the United States. Syenites found near Bancroft, Ontario contain large deposits of high-purity nepheline.

Elaeolite (a name given by M. H. Klaproth 1809, from Greek words for oil [ἔλαιον] and stone [λίθος]; ) is a massive form of translucent nepheline with a darker color and greasy luster.

==Uses==
Because of its high alumina content, iron-free nepheline is valued for use in glass manufacturing in place of feldspar. Most of the nepheline used for this purpose comes from Ontario. Nepheline produced as a byproduct of apatite mining in the Kola Peninsula has found uses in ceramics, leather, rubber, textiles, wood, and the oil industry. It can be used as a filler in paints, plastics, foam rubber, and sorbent. Nepheline of Kiya Shaltyr deposit (Kemerovo Region, Russia) is also used as a raw material for aluminium manufacturing.

<text>The Coolangatta Estate at Coolangatta, near Shoalhaven Heads was established in 1822 by Alexander Berry on the South Coast of New South Wales, Australia. Coolangatta Estate is located on the northern bank of the Shoalhaven River, in the foothills of Coolangatta Mountain. The word &#x27;Coolangatta&#x27; is from an aboriginal word which means either &quot;splendid view&quot; or &quot;good lookout&quot;. The estate today is in a picturesque setting overlooking the ocean and surrounded by vineyards.

==The Berry Family==

Born on St Andrew&#x27;s Day 1783, the eldest child of a tenant farming family in Fife, he studied at the University of St Andrews and Edinburgh and qualified as a surgeon. This led him to join the East India Company and started his travels to the Far East in 1802.

Berry arrived by sea on 23 June 1822, and while Edward Wollstonecraft looked after affairs in Sydney, proceeded to establish the first European settlement on the south coast of New South Wales, Australia.

The initial grant on the north side of the river soon expanded to the south with the agreement of the partners to take the charge and expense of one convict for every of land, and by purchases of the grants of Richardson, Hyndes and Burke. The property expanded to more than by 1863.

Berry, who married Wollstonecraft&#x27;s sister in 1827, set up his headquarters at the foot of Mount Coolangatta, north of the river with tools, provisions and the people who were to make up the first community.

Wollstonecraft died in 1832, but in the years to come, Berry was to be joined by his three brothers and two of his sisters, none of whom had any children.

A self-supporting village began to develop around the settlement. The partners used a combination of convict (referred to by Berry as &#x27;Government Men&#x27;) and free labour to drain the swamps, grow tobacco, potatoes, maize, barley and wheat and rear pigs and cattle, the latter kept for their hides and the production of milk and cheese. The estate also bred thoroughbred horses which were exported to India. These items were transported by means of a ship that they purchased and a sloop which they had built.

Later, in 1822, Hamilton Hume brought more cattle to the district, and a primary industry was established. Mills and workshops were established with tradesmen engaged in cask-making, building refabrication, experimental leather treatment, the production of condensed milk and gelatine, and shipbuilding; the first vessel being completed and launched as early as 1824. The town of Coolangatta in Queensland is named after one of Berry&#x27;s schooners which was wrecked there in August 1846.
However, it was the red cedar in the area, much of it exported to Europe, that was their most profitable resource.

Berry had experienced tenant-farming in his native land of Scotland, and by the 1850s and based on his experience developed the idea of &quot;clearing leases&quot;, an arrangement whereby tenants were given five years rent-free to clear and fence their property, after which they became tenants of Berry. It was this which enabled the true development of the area and of the township of Broughton Creek to begin.

After some initial disputes and at least one killing, Berry established a good relationship with the traditional owners of his land and the local Aboriginal population largely remained in place during his tenure.

In 1860 Conrad Martens, who was a good friend of Alexander Berry, visited him at the Coolangatta Estate and made a series of sketches of the property and surrounding area. He created the oil painting called &quot;Coolangatta Mountain&quot; which shows the property. (see painting on the left).

By 1868 the population had reached 300 and the area was declared a municipality, much against Alexander Berry&#x27;s wishes.
In 1873 Alexander Berry died and the estate passes to his younger brother David.

David Berry nurtured the development of Broughton Creek village, and the town grew and flourished. David Berry set aside land for an agricultural showground, and on the four corners of the town which he had surveyed, he gave land to the Church of England, Presbyterian, Wesleyan and Roman Catholic churches.

David died in 1889 at the age of 94, and in 1890 the name of Broughton Creek village was changed to Berry to honour the Alexander and David&#x27;s contribution to the region.

After David&#x27;s death, the Coolangatta Estate passed to the control of his cousin, Sir John Hay.

==The Hay Family==
John Hay was born at the Coolangatta Estate in 1840 but unfortunately his mother died soon after his birth. His father David Hay immigrated to New Zealand and settled at a property near Auckland. David later married Jessie McLeod and the couple had two sons and seven daughters.

At the age of eight John was sent to Scotland to be educated. After this he returned to New Zealand where he commenced several business ventures. He was at one time a member of Auckland City Council. In 1871 he married Jessie Sinclair who came from Glasgow but the couple had no children.
At the request of his cousin, David Berry, John came to Coolangatta in the 1880s to assist him with the management of the Estate. In 1889 David Berry died and John inherited the property. In the same year John’s father David Hay also died in Auckland so John invited his step mother and half-sisters to live with him at Coolangatta.

John Hay made many improvements to the Coolangatta Estate and developed land which had previously not been usable. David Berry had left large bequests in his will amounting to almost 250,000 pounds and John had to raise the money to meet these costs.

The Aboriginal people, mainly living at the northern foot of Coolangatta Mountain, were driven off their traditional land in 1901, during Hay&#x27;s time. Although health problems in the Aboriginal camp was the official reason given for their eviction, development of the land that they occupied was another reason for the eviction. The local people were sent to a reserve called Roseby Park, established by the Aborigines Protection Board, in 1900, at Orient Point.

When he died in 1909, John left the Estate to his half-brother Alexander Hay. However he made provisions in his will for his stepmother and half-sisters who had been living with him since 1889. To his stepmother Jessie and four unmarried half-sisters Mabel, Kate, Nona and Agnes (Daisy) he left a life interest in the building called &quot;The Cottage&quot; and also the furniture contained within it. He also left each of them 10,000 pounds which allowed them to become financially independent. Kate married soon after and so the other four women lived together at &quot;The Cottage&quot; until the late 1920s. A photo of Nona and Agnes (Daisy) in 1913 at Coolangatta is shown on the left.

John’s stepmother Jessie died in 1929 and Agnes (Daisy) died the following year. It seems that after this the two remaining half-sisters Mabel and Nona moved to Sydney and lived in the prestigious Astor apartments in Macquarie Street. The two women lead a very outgoing life and were frequently mentioned in the social pages of the newspapers.

Alexander Hay who had inherited Coolangatta in 1909 was considered to be a diligent and hard- working owner. He helped with the establishment of the Butter Factory in Berry and introduced pasteurisation to the area. In 1900 he married Florence Burdekin who was the daughter of a very wealthy businessman in Sydney.

In 1915 he enlisted to fight in World War 1 and went to Egypt as a Major. He was second in command of the NSW and Queensland Remounts. After the war he was elected as the Member for New England in the House of Representatives. He held this position for several years.

In 1941 Alexander Hay died and his son Alexander Berry Hay inherited the property. However Berry Hay did not maintain the estate and it went rapidly into decline. In 1946 the homestead caught fire and was destroyed. His second wife Elizabeth sold much of the remaining property to Colin Bishop who was a local farmer.

==Coolangatta Estate Today==

Colin Bishop bought about 100 hectares in 1949 and progressively added more land to his property. He used it for dairying but also had the idea to restore the old buildings. He achieved his ambition in 1972 when he opened the estate as an historic resort. A decade later he and his son Greg began planting wine grape vines.

Today Coolangatta Estate is a major tourist attraction. It offers accommodation, a golf course, wine tasting rooms, a restaurant and function rooms.

== The Coolangatta Statement ==
The &#x27;Coolangatta Statement on Indigenous Rights in Education&#x27;, &quot;a document that was submitted for discussion and refinement to all Indigenous participants at the 1993 WIPCE Conference was prepared by a Task Force who met in Coolangatta, New South Wales, between September 24 and October 1.&quot;

&quot;The WIPCE Coolangatta Statement on Indigenous Education is an important document developed through a collective native voice to address decades, if not centuries, of disparities for indigenous people around the world. This critical document helped to shape future foundational documents like the United Nations&#x27; Declaration on Rights of Indigenous People, and the 2014 Youth Statement on Indigenous Education drafted and ratified at the 2014 WIPCE in Honolulu, Hawai&#x27;i.&quot;

<text>The Order of British Columbia () is a civilian honour for merit in the Canadian province of British Columbia. Instituted in 1989 by Lieutenant Governor David Lam, on the advice of the Cabinet under Premier Bill Vander Zalm, the order is administered by the Governor-in-Council and is intended to honour current or former British Columbia residents for conspicuous achievements in any field, being thus described as the highest honour amongst all others conferred by the British Columbia Crown.

==Structure and appointment==
The Order of British Columbia, which evolved out of and replaced the earlier Order of the Dogwood, is intended to honour any current or former longtime resident of British Columbia who has demonstrated a high level of individual excellence and achievement in any field, demonstrating the &quot;greatest distinction and excell[ence] in any field of endeavour benefiting the people of the Province or elsewhere.&quot; Only those who are elected or appointed members of a governmental body are ineligible as long as they hold office. There are no limits on how many can belong to the order or be inducted at one time.

The process of finding qualified individuals begins with submissions from the public to the Order of British Columbia&#x27;s advisory council, which consists of the Chief Justice of British Columbia, who serves as the Chair; the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly; a president, in turn, of one of British Columbia&#x27;s public universities, for a two-year term; the President of the Union of British Columbia Municipalities; the Deputy Minister of Intergovernmental Relations; and two Members of the order. This committee then meets once yearly to make its selected recommendations to the lieutenant governor. Posthumous nominations are not accepted, though an individual who dies after his or her name was submitted to the advisory council can still be retroactively made a Member of the Order of British Columbia. The lieutenant governor, &quot;ex officio&quot; a Member and the Chancellor of the Order of British Columbia, then makes all appointments into the fellowship&#x27;s single grade of membership by an Order in Council that bears the viceroyal sign-manual and the Great Seal of the province; thereafter, the new Members are entitled to use the post-nominal letters &quot;OBC&quot;.

==Insignia==
Upon admission into the Order of British Columbia, in a ceremony held at Government House in Victoria, new Members are presented with the order&#x27;s insignia. The main badge consists of a gold medallion in the form of a stylized flower of the Pacific Dogwood—the official provincial flower—with the obverse in white enamel with gold edging, and bearing at its centre the escutcheon of the arms of British Columbia, all surmounted by a St. Edward&#x27;s Crown symbolizing the Canadian monarch&#x27;s role as the fount of honour. The ribbon is patterned with vertical stripes in green, white, blue, and gold, reflecting the colours within the provincial coat of arms; men wear the medallion suspended from this ribbon at the collar, while women carry theirs on a ribbon bow at the left chest. Members will also receive for wear on casual clothing a lapel pin, appearing as a smaller enamel Dogwood flower capped by a crown.

<doc id="411126" wikidata="Q519908" url="?curid=411126" title="Jim Davis (Florida politician)">
<text>James Oscar Davis III (born October 11, 1957) is an American politician from the U.S. state of Florida. He is a Democrat and served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1997 to 2007, representing Florida&#x27;s 11th congressional district. He was the Democratic nominee for governor of Florida in the 2006 election, but was defeated by Republican Charlie Crist.

==Early life and education==

Davis was born in Tampa, Florida. He graduated from Jesuit High School of Tampa in 1975, and attended Washington and Lee University, where he received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1979. He later attended the University of Florida&#x27;s College of Law, received his Juris Doctor in 1982. He later credited his grandfather as an important influence on his life.

==Career==
Davis worked as a lawyer in private practice from 1982 to 1988, when he became a partner in the Tampa-based business law firm of Bush, Ross, Gardner, Warren &amp; Rudy. Davis was elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 1989 and served until 1996, serving as House Majority Leader from 1995 to 1996.

==US House==
Davis entered the race for the Tampa-based 11th District in 1996, after Sam Gibbons—the district&#x27;s only congressman since its creation in 1963—announced his retirement. Although Gibbons had endorsed Davis as his successor, Davis finished second in a four-way Democratic primary behind former Tampa mayor Sandy Freedman. He won the runoff with 56 percent of the vote.
He faced Republican Mark Sharpe in the general election. The race was initially thought to be close, especially since Sharpe had nearly defeated Gibbons in 1994 and held him to 52 percent in 1992. However, Davis won by a convincing 15-point margin, largely due to Bill Clinton carrying the district. After defeating an underfunded Republican in 1998, Davis faced only a Libertarian candidate in 2000 and 2004 and was completely unopposed in 2002.

Davis was one of the co-chairs of the New Democrat Coalition in the House of Representatives. The New Democrat Coalition is affiliated with the centrist Democratic Leadership Council.

On October 10, 2002, Jim Davis was among the 81 House Democrats who voted in favor of authorizing the invasion of Iraq.

==2006 gubernatorial campaign==

Davis announced his candidacy for governor of Florida in 2005 and won the Democratic primary held on September 5, 2006. He defeated then-state Senator Rod Smith by a margin of 46 percent to 42 percent.

He received the endorsements of former U.S. President Bill Clinton, U.S. senator for Florida Bill Nelson, U.S. senator for Illinois Barack Obama, former Governor and U.S. Senator Bob Graham, former Governor Buddy MacKay, former First Lady Rhea Chiles (wife of Lawton Chiles), former Tallahassee mayor and Florida Democratic Party chairman Scott Maddox, Miami-Dade Democratic Party chairman Jimmy Morales, and Representatives Alcee Hastings, Robert Wexler, Corrine Brown, and Debbie Wasserman Schultz.

He lost the race to Attorney General Charlie Crist by a margin of 52–45.







==Post-political career==
, Davis is employed at the law and lobbying firm Holland &amp; Knight in Tampa.

In 2010, Davis was a member of and public speaker for Moving Hillsborough Forward, an organization formed to help pass a transit tax referendum on the general election ballot in Hillsborough County. Though there was some speculation that he might potentially run for Mayor of Tampa in 2011, he ultimately declined to run. Though then-Mayor Pam Iorio declared that Davis would be an &quot;excellent&quot; successor, it was speculated that the defeat of the rail referendum by voters left Davis with no platform to run for Mayor on. Davis is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One.

<text>Șerban Cantacuzino (), (1634/1640 – 29 October 1688) was a Prince of Wallachia between 1678 and 1688.

==Biography==
Șerban Cantacuzino was a member of the Romanian branch of the Cantacuzino noble family. He was forced to take part in the Ottoman campaign which ended in their defeat at the Battle of Vienna, despite sympathizing with the Holy League. According to Gaster (1911) it was alleged that he conceived the plan of marching on Constantinople to drive the Ottoman Empire out of Europe, the western powers having promised him their moral support.

Cantacuzino introduced maize to Wallachia and present-day Romania, in time the staple food—it was not yet extensively cultivated during his reign. He agreed to the establishment of various printing presses, and ordered the famous Romanian edition of the Bible (the &quot;Cantacuzino Bible&quot;), first published in Bucharest (1688). Through his influence also the Slavonic language was officially and finally abolished from the liturgy and the Romanian language substituted for it. He founded the first Romanian school in Bucharest. He also built the Cotroceni Monastery and the Șerban Vodă Inn.

His son later ruled as Ban of Oltenia, and was married to Ruxandra Rosetti.

===Siege of Vienna 1683===

In 1683, the Principality of Wallachia, led by Cantacuzino was forced to participate in the Battle of Vienna, nominally as an Ottoman vassal alongside the Principality of Transylvania, led by Michael I Apafi and Moldavia, led by George Ducas. Because the Ottomans did not have confidence in their allegiance, the troops of the principalities were only used for auxiliary tasks, such as building bridges. 

Although an Ottoman vassal, Prince Cantacuzino had negotiated with the Imperial forces for Wallachia to join the Christian side, longing for the position of protector of Christians in the Balkan Peninsula. In turn, the Habsburgs promised him the throne of Constantinople which was the capital of the Ottoman Empire.

On 14 July 1683, the Ottoman siege of Vienna started. Romanian sources point out that Cantacuzino and his soldiers were trying to sabotage the Ottoman siege, like abandoning the bridge over the Danube on Brigittenau Island, where the Wallachians had been stationed in order to cover the left flank of the Ottoman Army.
On 22 July, Cantacuzino&#x27;s forces were moved to Schönbrunn. From here, Prince Cantacuzino had repeatedly sent word to the defenders of Vienna, through their informant in the Turkish camp, Georg Kunitz, that his troops would immediately leave the work on the bridge and withdraw without a fight as soon as the troops of the Duke of Lorraine arrived. Cantacuzino also asked the Austrians to give a few fake cannon shots when they will see the Wallachians working on the construction of the bridge and they will withdraw immediately. On 30 August, Cantacuzino&#x27;s troops, after working all night on the bridge, left on the first cannon shots, according to the agreement established by Kunitz with the commanders of the Austrian troops.

On 1 September, Șerban ordered his soldiers to make a three-meter oak cross in the Gatterhölzel forest, near Schönbrunn, close to his tent. A few days before the end of the siege, he ordered his troops to bury the cross and ordered a prisoner, whom he released from the Tatars, that after the Ottomans left, he needs to go and tell Archbishop Kollonitsch to dig up the cross and raise it to a proper place where it may be daily honored by the people of Vienna. After the siege, the cross was found, transported to the city and installed inside a chapel on the spot where it was first erected. In 1961, the chapel was restored and now houses a miniature copy of the cross. The text on the cross reads:
After the attack led by John III Sobieski on 12 September, the Wallachian troops, who had not taken part in the fighting, crossed the Danube and headed east. In order to assure the Turks that his troops distinguished themselves in plunder, he bought a few cannons and a church bell from the Tatars.

Șerban&#x27;s loyal behavior toward the Christian cause was also noted in a letter written by Count von Waldstein, addressed to him a few years later.

===Death===
He died on . There is speculation that he was in fact poisoned by boyars who resented his vast, unrealistic and dangerous projects (presumably by his brothers, Constantin and ). His descendants include members of the Rosetti family, and the Romanian actor, Șerban Cantacuzino.

<doc id="411133" wikidata="Q1360643" url="?curid=411133" title="Trans-Siberian Orchestra">
<text>Trans-Siberian Orchestra (TSO) is an American rock band founded in 1996 by producer, composer, and lyricist Paul O&#x27;Neill, who brought together Jon Oliva and Al Pitrelli (both members of Savatage) and keyboardist and co-producer Robert Kinkel to form the core of the creative team. The band gained in popularity when they began touring in 1999 after completing their second album, &quot;The Christmas Attic&quot;, the year previous. In 2007, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; referred to them as &quot;an arena-rock juggernaut&quot; and described their music as &quot;Pink Floyd meets Yes and the Who at Radio City Music Hall&quot;. TSO has sold more than ten million concert tickets and over ten million albums. The band has released a series of rock operas: &quot;Christmas Eve and Other Stories&quot;, &quot;The Christmas Attic&quot;, &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s Last Night&quot;, &quot;The Lost Christmas Eve&quot;, their two-disc &quot;Night Castle&quot; and &quot;Letters From the Labyrinth&quot;. Trans-Siberian Orchestra is also known for their extensive charity work and elaborate concerts, which include a string section, a light show, lasers, moving trusses, video screens, and effects synchronized to music.

Both &quot;Billboard Magazine&quot; and &quot;Pollstar&quot; have ranked them as one of the top twenty-five ticket-selling bands in the first decade of the new millennium. Their path to success was unusual in that, according to O&#x27;Neill, TSO is the first major rock band to go straight to theaters and arenas, having never played at a club, never having been an opening act and never having had an opening act.

==History==
===Origins and formation===
Paul O&#x27;Neill managed and produced rock bands including Aerosmith, Humble Pie, AC/DC, Joan Jett, and Scorpions, later producing and co-writing albums by the progressive metal band Savatage, where he began working with Robert Kinkel, Al Pitrelli and Jon Oliva. Oliva had left Savatage to spend time with his family and take care of personal matters. O&#x27;Neill took his first steps into rock music in the 1970s when he started the progressive rock band Slowburn, for whom he was the lyricist and co-composer. What was intended to be the band&#x27;s debut album was recorded at Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s Electric Lady Studios and engineered by Dave Wittman. Although Wittman&#x27;s engineering was capturing the exact sound O&#x27;Neill was hearing in his head, O&#x27;Neill was having trouble with it because many of his melodies were between two and three octaves. Rather than releasing an album that he was not happy with, he shelved the project, but continued working in the industry at Contemporary Communications Corporation (also known as Leber &amp; Krebs).

Over the years, O&#x27;Neill continued to work as a writer, producer, manager, and concert promoter. In 1996, he accepted Atlantic Records&#x27; offer to start his own band. He built the band on a foundation created by the marriage of classical and rock music and the artists he idolized, such as Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, Queen, Yes, The Who, and Pink Floyd, and hard rock bands such as Aerosmith and Led Zeppelin and the multiple lead vocalists of the R&amp;B groups the Temptations and the Four Tops. He brought in Oliva, Kinkel, and Pitrelli to help start the project. O&#x27;Neill has stated, &quot;My original concept was six rock operas, a trilogy about Christmas and maybe one or two regular albums.&quot;

In the 1980s I was fortunate enough to have visited Russia. If anyone has ever seen Siberia, it is incredibly beautiful but incredibly harsh and unforgiving as well. The one thing that everyone who lives there has in common that runs across it in relative safety is the Trans-Siberian Railway. Life, too, can be incredibly beautiful but also incredibly harsh and unforgiving, and the one thing that we all have in common that runs across it in relative safety is music. It was a little bit overly philosophical, but it sounded different, and I like the initials, TSO.

===&quot;Christmas Eve and Other Stories&quot; and &quot;The Christmas Attic&quot; (1996–1998, 2014)===
Their debut album, the first installment of the intended Christmas Trilogy, was a rock opera called &quot;Christmas Eve and Other Stories&quot;, and was released in 1996. It remains among their best-selling albums. It contains the instrumental &quot;Christmas Eve/Sarajevo 12/24&quot; which originally appeared on Savatage&#x27;s rock opera, &quot;Dead Winter Dead&quot;, a story about the Bosnian War. Their 1998 release &quot;The Christmas Attic&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Christmas Eve and Other Stories&quot; followed a similar format. This album produced the hit &quot;Christmas Canon&quot;, a take on Johann Pachelbel&#x27;s &quot;Canon in D major&quot; with lyrics and new melodies added.
The Christmas Attic was first performed live in 2014.

===&quot;Beethoven&#x27;s Last Night&quot; (1999–2000, 2010–2012)===
&quot;Beethoven&#x27;s Last Night&quot; was written and recorded in 1998 and 1999 and turned over to Atlantic Records in late 1999 for release in 2000. The story begins when Mephistopheles appears before Beethoven, whom Paul O&#x27;Neill refers to as &quot;the world&#x27;s first Heavy Metal Rock Star&quot;, to collect the great composer&#x27;s soul. Of course Beethoven is horrified at the thought of eternal damnation, but the devil has an offer and the bargaining begins. There are numerous plot twists including the fate of his music, and the ending is based on a true but little known fact about Beethoven. Also in 1998, at the request of Scott Shannon of WPLJ, they performed live for the first time in a charity concert for Blythedale Children&#x27;s Hospital. In 1999, at the urging of Bill Louis, a DJ for WNCX in Cleveland, they did their first tour, during which they debuted sections of &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s Last Night&quot;. They performed the album in its entirety for the first time during the spring tour of 2010. In October 2011, &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s Last Night&quot; was released in Europe to coincide with their European tour with new cover art by Greg Hildebrandt and the missing pages of poetry from the original release.

The Mephistopheles songs are sung by Jon Oliva.

To coincide with the 2012 spring tour, &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s Last Night: The Complete Narrated Version&quot; was released by Atlantic/Rhino/Warner Brothers Record. This two-disc deluxe edition includes all the music from the original release and, for the first time, the narration featured during live performances of the album. It comes packaged with a booklet filled with Hildebrandt&#x27;s illustrations of the story, plus the full lyrics and narration. The narration is performed by Bryan Hicks, who has been handling the live narration on the tours for this album. Creator Paul O&#x27;Neill explains, &quot;This is how I have always envisioned the story being experienced. Where the listener can relax, close their eyes and within minutes be wandering the streets of 1800s Vienna with Beethoven on the last great adventure of his life.&quot;

===&quot;The Lost Christmas Eve&quot; (2004, 2013, 2024)===
Whenever the band was off the road they returned to the studio and in 2004 completed &quot;The Lost Christmas Eve&quot;, the final installment of the Christmas Trilogy. It is a story of loss and redemption that encompasses a rundown hotel, an old toy store, a blues bar, a Gothic cathedral and their respective inhabitants all intertwined on a single enchanted Christmas Eve in New York City. The next year they combined all three Christmas albums and released them in a box set titled &quot;The Christmas Trilogy,&quot; which also contained a DVD of their 1999 TV special &quot;The Ghosts of Christmas Eve&quot; (Each of the albums still continue to be available individually.) &quot;The Lost Christmas Eve&quot; was first performed live in 2012 followed by a encore tour in 2013. Critics once again called it &quot;stunning showmanship&quot; &quot;that included every trick known to man kind including massive pyro, spectacular lasers, stages that hover over the audience, hot back up singers all the while constantly connecting with their audience.&quot;

===&quot;Night Castle&quot; (2009–2011)===
After another few years of touring, &quot;Night Castle&quot;, Trans-Siberian Orchestra&#x27;s fifth album, released on October 27, 2009 was well received by fans and critics alike. It debuted at #5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Album Charts. It was certified gold in eight weeks and later platinum. &quot;Their most ambitious and adventurous work to date. It runs the gamut from hard rock to classical taking the listener on a journey through history detailing the triumphs and follies of man but is ultimately a story of transformation and love.&quot; Initially intended to be their first regular, non rock opera, consisting of ten stand alone songs album, O&#x27;Neill credits Jon Oliva persistence that it was too early for such a move and that the fifth album had to be a rock opera. Insisting that &quot;TSO was not like any other band and that the fans expected a story. It was a little bit of a role reversal because when we were working in Savatage, I was always wanting to do a concept record.&quot; The two-disc set includes a version of &quot;O Fortuna&quot; from &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; by Carl Orff, which was previewed live by the band during their 2004–2008 tours. An MP3 version of the album released through Amazon.com contains an additional track entitled &quot;The Flight of Cassandra&quot;.

The first half is a rock opera about a seven-year-old child on a beach who meets a stranger from New York City who tells her a story that takes her all around the world and through time where she encounters various characters, many of which are based on historical individuals such as Desiderius Erasmus. The second half pays homage to Trans-Siberian Orchestra&#x27;s influences. It also contains new versions of several Savatage songs as well as &quot;Nut Rocker&quot;, originally by B. Bumble and the Stingers and previously made famous by Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, featuring Greg Lake on bass guitar.

In February 2011, &quot;Night Castle&quot; was released in Europe with two live bonus tracks (&quot;Requiem&quot; and &quot;Toccata-Carpimus Noctem&quot;) added. Both live tracks were recorded on the 2010 spring tour at the Verizon Theatre at Grand Prairie, in Texas. Metal Kaoz, reviewed it as a two-hour plus double rock opera CD with, &quot;no filler&quot; that flows smoothly. &quot;The classical layers meet the beauty of Metal music and form the fine blend... a wide range of emotions and musical colors...tracks that will blow your mind. Hit play and wander freely in TSO&#x27;s, Night Castle.&quot;

===&quot;Dreams of Fireflies&quot; (2012)===
On October 30, 2012 Trans-Siberian Orchestra released a new five-song EP entitled &quot;Dreams of Fireflies (On a Christmas Night)&quot; on Lava Republic Universal Records. It debuted in &quot;Billboard&quot; Magazine&#x27;s Top 200 Albums chart at number #9, and #1 in the rock charts. It was the band&#x27;s first EP and with a list price of five dollars or under was Trans-Siberian Orchestra&#x27;s way of saying thank you to their fans. Rather than containing the usual TSO story, it was more like a Harry Chapin album where a short story is contained within the song. For example, &quot;Someday&quot; is about how people have a tendency to put off saying thank you to individuals that they owe a great debt to and with the best of intention tell themselves that they will do it someday. Also each song is accompanied by a short poem.

===&quot;Tales of Winter: Selections from the TSO Rock Operas&quot; (2013)===
Released on October 11, 2013, this fifteen-track collection is Trans-Siberian Orchestra&#x27;s first greatest hits collection and includes songs from all six prior releases. Cover art once again provided by Greg Hildebrandt.

===&quot;Who I Am&quot;===
On November 11, 2011, TSO released a new choral piece entitled, &quot;Who I Am&quot;. This was originally released as a digital download to fans who purchased tickets through the band&#x27;s ticket pre-sale but later became available through other music sites as well as being released on their 2015 album, &quot;Letters from the Labyrinth&quot;. The song was performed live as the opening number for the 2011 winter tour in acknowledgment of the rough times many people in the world were going through but bringing a message of hope by pointing out that together we can solve these problems as earlier generations have done in the past. It was accompanied by sound and video clips of individuals who helped humanity progress forward or overcome seemingly impossible situations. The first quote and image was Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. voice echoing &quot; I have a dream...that all men will be judged by the content of their character,&quot; followed by President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s inaugural challenge, &quot;Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.&quot; It included pictures of Jonas Salk, the scientist who cured polio, Saint &quot;Mother&quot; Teresa of Calcutta who spent her life caring for the unwanted and ended with Neil Armstrong taking the first step on the Moon and the NASA&#x27;s Gene Kranz paraphrased quote in regard to saving the astronauts aboard the damaged space capsule Apollo 13, that, &quot;Failure is not an option.&quot;

===&quot;Merry Christmas Rabbi&quot;===
In 2013 the band announced the late November release of a novella, &quot;Merry Christmas Rabbi&quot;. Referred to as the final missing piece to the Christmas Trilogy, it is the journal discovered by the girl in the &quot;Christmas Attic&quot; rock opera that leads into the song, &quot;Dream Child&quot;. Press releases described it as &quot;the story of a fateful Christmas Eve and how one of the craziest gambles in human history leads to a second chance for a troubled youth who finds himself past the point of no return.&quot;

===Deaths and more touring===

O&#x27;Neill died on April 5, 2017, at age 61, while staying at an Embassy Suites by Hilton hotel on the University of South Florida campus in Tampa. Cause of death as determined by the Hillsborough County, Florida medical examiner’s office, was intoxication from a mixture of methadone, codeine, Valium and doxylamine, and the manner of death as drug abuse.

In June of 2017, the organization announced that they would continue with their Christmas-themed touring. &quot;The Ghosts of Christmas Eve&quot; story, which they had performed in 2015 and 2016, was announced as their story once again for the 2017 tour.

David Z, bassist for TSO, died on July 14, 2017, while touring with Adrenaline Mob for their &quot;We The People&quot; tour; a tractor-trailer veered off Interstate 75 in Florida and struck the RV that Adrenaline Mob was riding in. Fellow TSO and Adrenaline Mob member Russell Allen was also injured in the accident.

For the 20th annual TSO winter tour in 2018, the band decided to once again tour with &quot;The Ghosts of Christmas Eve&quot; story. In 2019, TSO returned to the &quot;Christmas Eve and Other Stories&quot; show, which had previously been performed from the inaugural 1999 tour through 2011. No tour was held in 2020, due to continued mass gathering restrictions tied to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The band instead played an online livestream performance of &quot;Christmas Eve and Other Stories&quot; on December 18, and returned to physical performances in 2021 with the same &quot;Christmas Eve and Other Stories&quot; show.

In 2022, the band announced a tour of &quot;The Ghosts of Christmas Eve: The Best of TSO and More.&quot; 

A new instrumental song entitled &quot;Carousels of Christmas&quot;, written by Jon Oliva, was performed on the 2022 tour.

Keyboardist Vitalij Kuprij died on February 20, 2024.

==Legacy==
===Bands influenced===
In 2009, a group of musicians from the metro New York area formed a band, called The Wizards of Winter, inspired by TSO. The Wizards released their own limited-release Christmas album in 2011 while performing a mixture of TSO and original material in live concerts. In 2013, four of the original members of TSO — Tommy Farese, Guy LeMonnier, Tony Gaynor, and Michael Lanning toured as guests with The Wizards of Winter. Another original TSO vocalist, Joe Cerisano toured with them in 2014. The band released three new Christmas albums (&quot;The Wizards of Winter&quot;, &quot;The Magic of Winter&quot; and &quot;The Christmas Dream&quot;) with Guy LeMonnier and Tony Gaynor joining the band as full members. The band performs their own original material when touring, with TSO songs added occasionally. In June 2018, long-time TSO drummer John O. Reilly also joined the Wizards of Winter as a full member.

===Lighting displays===

In 2005 Carson Williams started a synchronized lighting race when he used 88 Light-O-Rama channels, over ten thousand lights and a small radio transmitter to illuminate his home to &quot;Wizards in Winter&quot;. A video of the house quickly went viral on the internet and eventually was picked up by Miller Lite as the theme for their TV ads over the next two years. Other homes soon followed eventually crossing to single homes with over a million lights. Soon after entire cities like Denver and Chicago were lighting their downtown districts in a similar manner, as well as many major theme parks such as Disney World and Universal Studios.

===Philanthropic activities===
Since Trans-Siberian Orchestra began touring, the band has donated over $16 million to a combination of local and national charities. At every tour stop, the group donates one dollar or more from each ticket sold to a local charity in the city where they are performing. A single day (two shows) in New Jersey&#x27;s Izod arena yielded $40,000 to local charities. The band helps any charity or group they think is in need but especially ones that protect and help children. In 2010 Paul O&#x27;Neill voiced the band&#x27;s philosophy on the TSO&#x27;s web site and also in the 2010 Winter Tour Book, &quot;We are all in this together. We must look out for the well being of each other, most of all the young. For the young are the architects of the future and we are the architects of the young. We can not tell those yet to be born that we did our best.&quot; Paul was a well known history buff.

===Fans and crew===
Paul O&#x27;Neill constantly stated that the fans own the band: &quot;TSO&#x27;s goal is to make the best albums and concerts we possibly can, sparing no amount of time or expense and then charge the lowest possible price. No musician or singer is on the TSO flight deck for the money. We do it because we love the energy from the crowd especially the kids. Also in Trans Siberian Orchestra the crew are as much a member of the band as anyone on the flight deck. They actually have the hardest jobs. They are the first ones in and the last ones out. Watching them at work is like watching a well choreographed ballet or military operation. TSO could not be TSO without them and we know it.&quot; Al Pitrelli summed it up more humorously, &quot;No one in TSO is paid to be on the stage, that we do for free. The money is to stay out of trouble on our off time.&quot;

Over the years, O&#x27;Neill consistently thanked the audience, referring to them as the second half of Trans-Siberian Orchestra and that without them TSO would just be notes and words echoing in an empty arena. &quot;The fans&#x27; enthusiasm and energy power the stage show as much, if not more, than any local electric company.&quot;

==Touring==
In 1999, TSO performed a stage adaptation of &quot;Christmas Eve and Other Stories&quot; for its first live tour. The popularity of these initial shows prompted O&#x27;Neill to form two touring bands, divided between the East and West coasts, allowing TSO to perform a greater number of shows during their holiday touring period.

In 2009, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked TSO as one of the Top 25 Touring Artists of the past decade. Live shows are known for their extensive use of pyrotechnics, lasers, and lights synchronized with the performance.

The band engaged in spring tours between 2010 and 2012. During the spring tours, the band played &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s Last Night&quot; album in its entirety; songs of &quot;Night Castle&quot; were also played during these tours. In 2011, for the very first time in the band&#x27;s history, a European leg was included, with venues predominantly in Germany, but also in Austria, Belgium, England, and Switzerland. Initially, Savatage was announced to reunite at the end of the TSO setlist. However, the plans were scrapped, as the band cited undisclosed personal matters that held Jon Oliva from being available to tour.

Their 2012-2013 Fall/Winter tour, sponsored by the Hallmark Channel featured &quot;The Lost Christmas Eve&quot; album in place of &quot;Christmas Eve and Other Stories&quot;.

In 2013, TSO kicked off their second European tour with a performance on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2013-14 in front of over one million fans at Berlin&#x27;s Brandenburg Gate. &quot;A daring feat in which the band played three shows across two continents in 27 hours.&quot; The show was broadcast live to millions more on German television.

In August 2014, the band announced the first half of the winter tour they would feature &quot;The Christmas Attic&quot;, the only rock opera from the &quot;Christmas Trilogy&quot; never performed live up to that point.

In August 2019, TSO announced the return of &quot;Christmas Eve and Other Stories&quot; for the winter tour.

In August 2022, TSO announced the return of &quot;the Ghosts of Christmas Eve&quot; for the winter tour. A new instrumental song entitled &quot;Carousels of Christmas Lights&quot;, written by Jon Oliva, is being performed on the 2022 tour.

in September 2024, TSO announced the return of The Lost Christmas Eve, their first tour in many years without Hallmark Channel sponsorship. This year also marked the 20 millionth ticket sold and 20 million dollars given to charity.

===Wacken Open Air Festival 2015===
On July 30, 2015, Trans-Siberian Orchestra and a reunited Savatage headlined the 26th edition of Wacken Open Air Festival in Germany, which is the largest metal festival in the world. The 2015 festival lasted three days and featured over one hundred bands. This event marked both TSO&#x27;s first outdoor festival appearance and first Savatage show in 13 years. A massive set was designed so that the two main festival stages would be identical, although this aspect of the show was not revealed until the second half of the performance. For the first 40 minutes Savatage played a reunion show featuring Jon Oliva as the main lead singer for the first time in over 25 years, as well as Zak Stevens. This was followed by a Trans-Siberian Orchestra set on the next stage debuting several new songs. Following this, for the first time in music history, the entire band played a coordinated set spanning the two festival main stages, connected by a catwalk. This united Trans-Siberian Orchestra featured four guitarists, four keyboard players, two drummers, two bassists, a full string section, and 24 vocalists and dancers performing in sync for nearly 80,000 people.

In the televised broadcast a week after the show (but right before the actual performance), Paul O&#x27;Neill and Al Pitrelli admitted to being blindsided by non-stop rain and mud on the night before which removed any chance to check the staging until the actual show. Metal Recusants, which favorably reviewed the entire event said that &quot;[i]f all the above shows were spectacular and memorable the Savatage&#x27;s and Trans-Siberian Orchestra show is a whole new level of shows...I have never seen such a thing take place before and it was definitely a once in a lifetime experience.&quot;

<text>Adam Hughes Putnam (born July 31, 1974) is an American politician who served as the 11th Florida commissioner of agriculture from 2011 to 2019. A member of the Republican Party, he previously served in the U.S. House of Representatives for five terms, representing the Central Florida-based 12th congressional district. He chaired the House Republican Conference from 2007 to 2009.

In May 2017, he announced he was running for Governor of Florida in the 2018 election. Putnam was initially considered the frontrunner for the Republican nomination, but lost the primary to U.S. Representative Ron DeSantis. DeSantis went on to win the general election against Tallahassee mayor and Democratic nominee Andrew Gillum.

He has been the CEO of Ducks Unlimited since 2019.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Putnam was born in Bartow, Florida, the son of Sarah Elizabeth (née Hughes) and William Dudley Putnam II. He graduated from Bartow High School and attended the University of Florida, graduating with a Bachelor of Science in food and resource economics. He is an Episcopalian.

In 1996, Putnam was elected to the Florida House of Representatives, representing parts of Polk County. At 22 years old, he was the youngest person ever elected to the Florida Legislature. He was reelected to a second term in 1998. While in the state house, he served as chair of the Agriculture Committee.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

In 2000, Putnam ran for the U.S. House seat being vacated by retiring Congressman Charles Canady. The district, numbered the 12th, included all of Putnam&#x27;s home constituency as well as other areas of Polk County and rural Central Florida. He faced no opposition in the Republican primary, and defeated Democrat Mike Stedem in the general election, 57 to 43%. Taking office when he was 26 years old, Putnam was the youngest member of Congress from 2001 to 2005. Putnam was reelected in 2002 to a redistricted seat that included most of Polk County as well as parts of neighboring Hillsborough and Osceola Counties. He was reelected three more times after that, serving a total of ten years in Congress.

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Financial Services
** Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Insurance, and Government Sponsored Enterprises
** Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity

===Tenure===
On October 10, 2002, Putnam voted in favor of authorizing the invasion of Iraq.

In February 2006, Putnam became a member of the House leadership, assuming the role of chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee, the fifth-ranking Republican leadership position in the House. In November 2006, Putnam was elected by his colleagues as House Republican Conference Chairman, the third-highest ranking position. Following House Republican losses in the 2008 general election, he resigned his post as Conference Chairman. In 2010 &quot;The Florida Independent&quot; reported that Putnam had earmarked $100,000 for an abscission chemical used in citrus harvesting that &quot;The Florida Independent&quot; said would benefit his family&#x27;s citrus business.

Putnam was a signatory to the Taxpayer Protection Pledge. The American Conservative Union gave him a 91% evaluation.

===Gonzales&#x27; ouster===
After the numerous calls by Democrats, including Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Speaker of the House and Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV), Putnam became the top Republican in either house to call for the ouster of then U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. &quot;For the good of the nation, I think it is time for fresh leadership at the Department of Justice&quot;, Putnam said. This was met with surprise by many Republicans, who were remaining silent on the Gonzales issue. However, Putnam mentioned that there remained severe discontent within the GOP circle over Gonzales and as the Chairman of the House Republican Conference, he thought that it was important to send this message out.

==Commissioner of Agriculture and Consumer Services==

In February 2009, Putnam declared himself a candidate for Florida Commissioner of Agriculture and Consumer Services in the 2010 election and that he would not seek a sixth term in Congress. Putnam won the election over Democratic opponent Scott Maddox with 56% of the vote. He was reelected in 2014.

As head of the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, Putnam was responsible for issuing concealed weapons permits after conducting background checks on applicants. An investigation by the Office of Inspector General found that from February 2016 until May 2017 the department stopped conducting national background checks on applicants for concealed weapons permits, because a worker could not log into an FBI database. More than 100,000 concealed carry permits were issued during this period without full screening. Putnam later said that 365 applicants should have been further backgrounded, and that 291 permits ended up being revoked for noncriminal disqualifying factors (drug abuse, mental illness, fugitives). Putnam pointed out that concealed carry permits do not allow gun purchases, which require a background check at the time of purchase. Florida Governor Rick Scott said that the incident was &quot;disturbing&quot; and &quot;concerning&quot; adding, &quot;People need to do their jobs. This is public safety.&quot; Additional failures in conducting proper reviews of gun permit applications were reported in a 2012 report of the inspector general, including the issuance of gun licenses to felons, which occurred during the first years of Putnam&#x27;s tenure, although certain instances occurred before Putnam&#x27;s tenure.

In response to the 2013 series &quot;Worst Charities in America&quot; by the &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; and the Center for Investigative Reporting (CIR)—the result of a year-long joint investigation, in 2014 Putnam crafted CS/SB 638 and CS/HB 629—legislation that was intended to crack down on &quot;fraudulent and deceptive organizations&quot; to prevent them from misusing charitable contributions donated by residents of Florida. The legislation &quot;had passed two of their three referenced committees&quot; by March 2014.

==Gubernatorial campaign==
In May 2017, Putnam announced his campaign for the governorship of Florida in the 2018 election to succeed term-limited Republican Rick Scott. He was one of eight candidates running for the Republican nomination.

Putnam placed second in the primary election, which was won by U.S. Representative Ron DeSantis. However, as of April 2018, Putnam&#x27;s campaign had acquired $19.2 million in campaign contributions, far more than any other candidate. His PAC, Florida Grown, received large contributions from The Walt Disney Company ($824,442), Publix ($736,000), Florida Power and Light ($587,060) and U.S. Sugar ($560,000). The donations from Publix to Putnam drew public protest, including a die-in at a Publix supermarket, resulting from Putnam&#x27;s claim of being a &quot;proud NRA sell-out&quot;.

<doc id="411140" wikidata="Q2446654" url="?curid=411140" title="Ghica family">
<text>The House of Ghica [or Ghika] (; }; , &quot;Gikas&quot;) was an Albanian noble family whose members held significant positions in Wallachia, Moldavia and later in the Kingdom of Romania, between the early 17th century and late 19th century. The Ghica family produced many voivodes of Wallachia and Moldavia and two Prime Ministers of Romania. Several branches of the family still exist today.

==History==
===Origins===
The Ghica family is of Albanian origin. The first recorded Ghica in historical records is Gheorghe Ghica. His family originally came from Albania and the wider region of Epirus and was possibly born in North Macedonia, south of the city of Skopje, in Köprülü (present-day Veles). Köprülü as his birthplace may be a later mistake based on Ion Neculce&#x27;s literary narrative about his ties to Köprülü Mehmed Pasha. Mihai Cantacuzino in the 18th century place his geographical origin &quot;from the Albanians of Zagora, in the region of Ianina&quot;. In all available historical sources, despite the discrepancies about his exact birthplace, he is always referred to as an Albanian, an indication of his origin&#x27;s role in the patronage networks which supported his political career. His father&#x27;s name is unknown but Alexandru Ghica, a descendant of Gheorghe Ghica, suggested that his name was Matei (ca. 1565–1620). This figure hasn&#x27;t been recorded in archival material and his existence is disputed. Gheorghe Ghica was engaged in commerce in Constantinople and traveled as a merchant to Iași in the Romanian principalities. Ghica quickly moved upwards in the Romanian principalities mainly because he supported and was supported by other Albanians in the central and regional Ottoman administration. Ghica joined Vasile Lupu, an Albanian emigre who was Voivode of Moldavia and became his most trusted officer and representative in the Ottoman court. Miron Costin (1633–1691), a contemporary Romanian historian wrote about the clientelist relations in Ottoman hierarchy between figures of the same origin and noted that &quot;being of the same origin as him [Ghica] – that is Albanian – voievode Vasile brought him to the court and entrusted him some minor offices, and later [Ghica] reached the position of the Chief Judge of Lower Moldavia.&quot; Lupu&#x27;s fall brought Ghica to an alliance with another Albanian, the Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire, Köprülü Mehmed Pasha. In the Romanian principalities, Mehmed Pasha promoted an &#x27;ethnicity-based patronage system&#x27; and chose to appoint Albanians as a means to strengthen his apparatus in the region. Gheorghe Ghica (voivode of Moldavia (1658–59), voivode of Wallachia (1859–1860)), his son Grigore (voivode of Wallachia, 1660–64), and Vasile Lupu&#x27;s son, Ștefăniță Lupu (voivode of Moldavia, 1659–61) all were appointed by Köprülü Mehmed Pasha. Ion Neculce (1672–1745), another contemporary Romanian historian who continued the tradition of Miron Costin, recorded a tale about Gheorge Gica and Mehmed Pasha. According to the tale, they came from poor families and had met when they were children in Constantinople. The future Mehmed Pasha promised that he would help Ghica when he became powerful. Years later when they met again Mehmed Pasha supposedly remembered their meeting and made Ghica, voivode of Moldavia. The tale is definitely a literary construction, but it has historical value because its narration highlights the existing patronage ties of its era. Ghica married Smaragda (Smada) Lână, daughter of Stamate Lână, the &quot;Stolnic&quot; (Seneschal) of Broşteni. Ghica rooted his family in the feudal class of Romania via the marriage of his son Grigore to the niece of Gheorghe Ștefan.

===Rise===

Following the power vacuum resulting from the failed Transylvanian-Wallachian-Moldavian anti-Ottoman uprising organized by Prince George II Rákóczi, Gheorghe Ghica managed to secure his position as Voivode of Moldavia, a position he held between 1658–1659 and 1659–1660. Unable to cope with the financial burdens imposed by the Porte, he was dismissed; nonetheless, following the intervention of Mehmed Pasha his son Grigore I Ghica became the new voivode. He was Gheorghe Ghica&#x27;s oldest surviving son, born in Constantinople from a relationship he had with Ecaterina Vlasto, a Catholic from Pera. He had followed his father to Moldavia, where he further raised his family into the ranks of the indigenous Great Boyars, by marrying Maria Sturdza, daughter of &quot;Vistiern&quot; (Treasurer) Mateiaș Sturdza of the Sturdza family, and niece of the Moldavian Prince Gheorghe Ștefan. The Ghica formed a close alliance with the Sturdza and Cantacuzino families in the 17th century.

Grigore I Ghica&#x27;s rule was also not free from disturbances due to the conflict with the Sublime Porte and especially because of the disputes between the Boyar parties. Through his political maneuvers and the assassination of his former mentor Constantine Cantacuzino, he instigated the hatred of nobility against him and his entourage. Taking advantage of the defeat of the Ottomans at the Battle of Levice (1664), Grigore fled to Poland and then to Vienna, in search of Habsburg military aid. His hopes having not been materialized, he returned to Constantinople and acquired the Moldavian throne once again in 1672. During his short second reign, the animosity of the Cantacuzinos exploded violently, and after the defeat of the Turks at Khotyn in 1673, Grigore was forced to flee to Constantinople; the hostility of his opponents lost his throne and he will die in Constantinople in 1674.

Grigore I Ghica&#x27;s children, most notably Matei (Grigore) Ghica, assured the continuation of the lineage. Matei Ghica lived exclusively in Greek Phanar neighborhood of Constantinople. The marriage with Ruxandra Mavrocordat, daughter of Alexander Mavrocordatos, the Dragoman of the Sublime Porte, introduced Matei to the Phanariote nucleus – now the religious, cultural and political hegemons of the Christian Ottoman subjects and vassals – and ensured a path of political ascendancy for his descendants. He became Grand Drogoman of The Fleet, and in 1739 he negotiated an agreement with the Sultan whereby the key position of Grand Dragoman of the Sublime Porte would remain within the fold – i.e. among the descendants of a family pact involving the Ghicas, Mavrocordatos and Racoviţăs.

His son Grigore II Ghica, initiated in the intricacies of the Ottoman politics due to his rank as Dragoman, succeeded in acquiring the Moldavian throne on 26 September 1726. During his rule in Moldavia, Grigore II Ghica made proof of great diplomatic skills by leveling an unfortunate conflict with the Crimean Khanate who threatened to ravage the country. In 1733 a swap of thrones took place, with Grigore II going to Wallachia in place of his cousin Constantine Mavrocordatos. Grigore II Ghica&#x27;s diplomatic skills proved even more remarkable during the Russo-Austrian-Turkish War, when the Prince of Moldavia, at the request of the Porte, acted as the intermediary and mediator between the Ottomans and Russians through correspondence and exchange of envoys with the Russian Field Marshal Burkhard Christoph von Münnich, with John Bell, the secretary of the British embassy in St. Petersburg, with the French ambassador to Constantinople, Louis Sauveur Villeneuve, as well as with the great Ottoman dignitaries.

<doc id="411141" wikidata="Q3781719" url="?curid=411141" title="Samata Party">
<text>The Samata Party (SAP) is a political party in India, initially formed in 1994 by George Fernandes and Nitish Kumar, is now being led by Uday Mandal as its National President. Samata Party once launched Nitish Kumar as the Chief Minister of Bihar. It was an offshoot of the Janata Dal, with the alleged casteism of the parent party being the reason given for the split. The party has socialist leanings; at one point, it wielded considerable political and social influence in North India, particularly in Bihar. In 2003, most Samata Party members joined Janata Dal (United). Only a faction led by MP Brahmanand Mandal remained in the Samata party and continued to use the party name and symbols.

==History==
In the general elections of 1996, the Samata Party formed an alliance with the Bharatiya Janta Party and won eight seats, six of which were in Bihar and one each in Uttar Pradesh and Odisha. Before the election, the party was largely rooted only in Bihar. In the 1998 general elections, again in alliance with Bharatiya Janta Party, it won twelve seats, ten from Bihar and two from Uttar Pradesh.

In March 2000, Nitish Kumar was elected leader of the NDA for Chief Minister of Bihar post. On 3 March, he was sworn in as the Chief Minister of Bihar for the first time at the behest of the Vajpayee Government in the center. NDA and allies had 151 MLA whereas Lalu Prasad Yadav had 159 MLA in the 324-member house. Both alliances were less than the majority mark, 163. Nithish resigned because he could not prove his numbers in the house.

Radhabinod Koijam became the second chief minister from Samata Party when was sworn in as Chief Minister of Manipur on 15 February 2001. The government was, however, short-lived. The coalition he was leading fell in May of the same year.

In the 1999 Loksabha election, Samata Party was in an informal alliance with the Lok Shakti and the Janata Dal(U). A proposal to merge the three into a single party was called off in January 2000 by George Fernandes who said the party would contest in the 2000 Bihar Legislative Assembly election on its own.

=== 2003 Split and merger with JD (U) ===
In October 2003, George Fernandes, the president of the Samata Party, announced that the party would be completely merging with the Janata Dal (United). The Janata Dal (United) was part of the ruling coalition in the National Democratic Alliance.

Samata Party Member of parliament (Lok Sabha) Brahmanand Mandal was opposed to the merger split with the other members. Mandal was the leader of the minority faction opposing the merger. Since all the members did not support the official merge, and Brahmanand&#x27;s faction challenged the merger of the party in front of ECI, the merger wasn&#x27;t officially recognized by the Election Commission of India. The Election Commission of India decided that the merger was not technically complete and so a faction was allowed to function under the Samata Party name.

Party leader Sharad Yadav, said that the ECI decision would have no effect on his merger plans as all candidates of Samata Party would be contesting the upcoming 2004 Lok Sabha election as candidate of Janata Dal United on the election symbol of Arrow.

Most members of the party merged with JDU as proposed however a small faction of Samata Party continued using the name Samata party under the leadership of Brahmanand Mandal.

=== Samata Party after 2004 ===
In the 2009 general elections for the 14th Lok Sabha (2009-2014), it had contested in 11 seats and was defeated in all of them. It had secured a total of 31324 votes which was only 0.02 percent of the total number of votes cast in that state.

For the Lok Sabha elections of 2014, the Samata Party decided to forgo any alliance, stating that it would not ally with the Congress.
Due to the departure of all the bigwigs from the Samata Party to Janata Dal (United), the party started shrinking gradually. Due to its poor election performance, it began to lose popularity and was almost on the verge of closure. In 2020, the leadership of the party was given to Uday Mandal, he started restructuring it.


===Fernandes return in Samata Party in 2007===
In 2007, George Fernandes left JD(U) and joined Samata Party along with their supporters, JD(U) general secretary and spokesman Shiv Kumar and senior leader Aneel Hegde, several other leaders and workers from various states left the JD(U) to join the Samata Party on the occasion. These included the Gujarat party unit president Praveensinh Jadeja, Andhra Pradesh unit chief Narasimha Reddy, Uttarakhand party chief Anurag Kumar and suspended party MLA from Bihar Chhedi Paswan. Also present on the occasion was former MP Brahmanand Mandal, the current president of Samata Party who had refused to join the JD(U) at the time of merger.

== Ideology ==
The party follows a socialist ideology; in particular, that of Ram Manohar Lohia.

==Electoral performances==

=== Lok Sabha (Lower House) ===

=== Vidhan Sabha (Lower House) ===

== List of chief ministers ==

==Symbol crisis==
The Election Commission of India allotted the &quot;Flaming Torch&quot; symbol to Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), the Samata Party raise objection against it. A petition filed in Delhi High Court, Samata Party through Uday Kr Mandal its President vs Election Commission of India. A single bench of Justice Sanjeev Narula dismissed the case, Samata party appeal in double bench of Judges. Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Subramontium Prasad again dismissed that appeal. In Uttar Pradesh Local Body Election 2022, Samata Party got their symbol, now the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray) and Samata Party both have the &quot;Flaming Torch or Mashal&quot;.

Michelle Doris Thomas was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, on September 23, 1968, to Phynjuar &quot;Penwah&quot; Thomas, a stage actress, and musician father Dennis &quot;Dee Tee&quot; Thomas (1951–2021), a saxophonist and founding member of the band Kool &amp; the Gang. Thomas grew up in Montclair, New Jersey, and graduated from West Essex High School in 1987.

As a child, she would accompany her mother to her theater rehearsals and performances. Her mother was her first acting coach, and coached her throughout the course of her career. A friend of her mother who had heard Thomas sing before had requested that she enter Miss Talented Teens. Thomas was crowned Miss Talented Teen New Jersey at the state&#x27;s Hal Jackson&#x27;s Talented Teen pageant, and then in July 1984, at the age of 15, she was crowned Miss Talented Teen International in Montego Bay, Jamaica from among 35 state and national representatives.

==Career==
In 1983, Thomas appeared in her first television commercial. In December 1984, she appeared with Hal Jackson on &quot;Soul Train&quot; after having won the Miss Talented Teen International pageant earlier in the year.

From 1988 to 1990, Thomas portrayed Justine Phillips, the girlfriend of Theo Huxtable, on &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;. She appeared on various television programs, including &quot;A Man Called Hawk&quot; in 1989 and &quot;Thea&quot; in 1994. Thomas had a role in &quot;Dream Date&quot; in 1989 and had a small role in &quot;Hangin&#x27; with the Homeboys&quot; in 1991.

Thomas appeared in music videos for Mint Condition, Chubb Rock, and Dru Hill. Her publicist was Kahdijah Bell, daughter of Ronald Bell of Kool &amp; the Gang. Thomas was a guest host of the weekly music series &quot;Soul Train&quot; in May 1996 and March 1997.

From 1993 to 1998, she portrayed the role of Myra Monkhouse, the girlfriend of Steve Urkel, on &quot;Family Matters&quot;. After the sitcom ended in 1998, Thomas portrayed Callie Rogers, an aspiring singer and love interest of Malcolm Winters, on the daytime soap &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. In October 1998, Thomas took a medical leave from the series due to her ill health. Thomas had been in the studio recording music before her sudden turn in health. She appeared posthumously in the role of Anne in the film &quot;Unbowed&quot; in 1999.

==Health and death==

In August 1997, Thomas was diagnosed with a rare cancer, an intra-abdominal desmoplastic small-round-cell tumor (DSRCT). Thomas never smoked or drank alcohol, and was a vegetarian. Her mother added that &quot;they&#x27;d give her a sedation that was supposed to put her out for 20 minutes and she&#x27;d be asleep for four days. Her body couldn&#x27;t take it.&quot; Thomas underwent surgery to remove a lemon-sized tumor in early 1998, and subsequently was cast on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. She underwent surgery again in October 1998 after a second cancerous growth ruptured. After being released from the hospital, Thomas flew home to Weehawken, New Jersey to spend Thanksgiving with her family.

On December 23, 1998 at the age of 30, Thomas died as a result of a desmoplastic tumor, in New York City at Manhattan&#x27;s Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Malcolm-Jamal Warner, Thomas&#x27; longtime friend and former boyfriend, was among those at her bedside. On December 26, 1998, a Muslim funeral service was held, per her request. She was buried in New Jersey.

<text>Janata Dal (United) (&quot;People&#x27;s Party (United)&quot;), abbreviated as JD(U), is a social-democratic and secularist Indian political party, rooted mainly in eastern and north-eastern India, whose stated goals are promoting social justice and lifting up marginalised people. JD(U) is recognised as a state party in the states of Bihar, where it heads the government, Manipur, where it is part of the government coalition in the legislative assembly, and Arunachal Pradesh. JD(U), as part of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance, won 12 seats in the 2024 Indian general election, making it the seventh largest party in the Lok Sabha.

JD(U) was formed with the merger of Sharad Yadav&#x27;s faction of the Janata Dal, the Samata Party and the Lok Shakti party on 30 October 2003. The party&#x27;s mentor and patron was the veteran socialist George Fernandes, successively leader of the Samyukta Socialist Party, the Socialist Party and the Samata Party. However, the Election Commission of India initially refused the merger of the latter: party president Brahmanand Mandal was suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and not physically well, so Uday Mandal replaced him.

==History==
===Formation===

The Janata Dal (United)&#x27;s origin goes back to the period before 1999 General Election. A faction led by then Chief Minister of Karnataka J. H. Patel had lent support to the National Democratic Alliance, leading to the split in the Janata Dal leading to the formation of Janata Dal (Secular) under H. D. Deve Gowda, who wanted to remain equidistant from both national parties; and Janata Dal under Sharad Yadav was called Janata Dal (United).

The Janata Dal (United) was formed with the merger of the Sharad Yadav faction of the Janata Dal, the Lok Shakti and the Samata Party. On 30 October 2003, the Samata Party led by George Fernandes and Nitish Kumar merged with the Janata Dal. The merged entity was called Janata Dal (United) with the arrow symbol of Janata Dal (United) and the green and white flag of the Samata Party. The uniting force is believed to be common opposition to Rashtriya Janata Dal in Bihar especially after the Rashtriya Janata Dal welcomed Samata Party rebels like Raghunath Jha into the party.

===In NDA===

JD(U) joined NDA and along with its alliance partner, the BJP defeated the RJD-led UPA government in Bihar in November 2005. New government was headed by JD(U) leader, Nitish Kumar and NDA continued to govern state. The alliance contested 2009 Indian general election and won 32 seats. BJP won 12 while JD(U) won 20. JD(U) won 115 and BJP won 91 seats in 2010 Bihar Legislative Assembly election. Thus together holding 206 seats in 243 member Bihar Legislative Assembly.

===Out of NDA===

JD(U) broke its 17 years old alliance with the BJP in Bihar in protest against the elevation of Narendra Modi as ahead of the election campaign committee of BJP for 2014 Indian general election. JD(U) President Sharad Yadav and then Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar announced their end of coalition at a press conference on 16 June 2013, exactly a week after Narendra Modi was made the BJP&#x27;s campaign committee chairman, who was later made the prime ministerial candidate of NDA. Just after this split, Sharad Yadav relinquished his position as the NDA convenor.

The JD(U) contested the election in Bihar in an alliance with the Communist Party of India but they won only two seats out of total forty seats of Bihar while the BJP-LJP alliance won 31 seats. Following poor performance in election, Nitish Kumar resigned as Chief Minister of Bihar and Jitan Ram Manjhi sworn in as a new Chief Minister. When the trust vote was demanded by the BJP to prove majority in Bihar Legislative Assembly, the RJD supported the JD(U) in the assembly on 23 May 2014 to pass the majority mark.

===The Mahagathbandhan (Grand Alliance)===

On 29 December 2014, Kerala-based Socialist Janata (Democratic) merged with the JD(U) with its leader M.P. Veerendra Kumar, accepting the party flag from JD(U) leader Nitish Kumar. This was an important milestone in bringing a pan-Indian appeal to the JD(U) which is largely limited to the state of Bihar.

On 14 April 2015, the JD(U), Janata Dal (Secular), Rashtriya Janata Dal, the Indian National Lok Dal, Samajwadi Party, and Samajwadi Janata Party announced that they would merge into a new national Janata Parivar alliance in order to fight against the BJP in cooperation with one another, thus leaving the UPA. But for some reason this did not take place and the Samajwadi Party was subsequently offered 3 seats out of an assembly of 243 in the Bihar elections. Unhappy with this deal, it left the alliance and fought the elections separately.
On 9 May, MLA Jitan Ram Manjhi was expelled from the JD(U) and he later founded the Hindustani Awam Morcha along with 17 other dissent JD(U) MLAs.

In the 2015 Bihar Legislative Assembly election JD(U) contested the election in an alliance with the RJD and Congress. It won 71 seats out of the 101 seats it contested and the alliance won 178 seats out the 243 seats in the assembly. Subsequently, Nitish Kumar again became the Chief Minister of Bihar.

In the biennial elections to the Rajya Sabha held in March 2016, the ruling UDF of Kerala state gave one seat to JD(U) Kerala State Unit President M.P. Veerendra Kumar. In spite of having just 2 MLAs in the Legislative Assembly, the Congress gave a berth to its ally.

===Alliance with NDA===

On 26 July 2017 5 pm, Nitish Kumar tendered his resignation as Chief Minister of Bihar, ending 20-month-old &quot;Mahgathbandhan&quot; (grand alliance) rule. The next day on 27 July 2017 10 am he again took oath as Chief Minister of Bihar with the support of BJP. Same day evening, Kerala JD(U) chief M.P. Veerendra Kumar announced the split of Kerala unit of the JD(U) from the party, due to Nitish Kumar led Bihar unit joined hands with the BJP. On 28 July 2017, new NDA government won trust vote in Bihar assembly by 131 votes in favour and 108 against, four legislators did not vote.
=== Out of NDA ===
On 9 August 2022, Nitish Kumar announced that the JD(U)&#x27;s alliance with the BJP in the Bihar Legislative Assembly was over. He further made a claim that the new government in Bihar, a coalition of nine parties including the RJD and the INC would be a &quot;Mahagathgandhan 2.0.&quot;

===Reorganisation after 2020 Assembly elections===

The JD(U), just like its parent Samata Party, had the core support of Kushwaha and Kurmi caste, which emanated from the great rally organised in 1993 at Gandhi Maidan, Patna. In 2020 Assembly elections, the party performed badly, and its seats in Bihar Legislative Assembly reduced to 43 from 75 in 2015 elections. The breakaway of the faction led by Upendra Kushwaha, who founded Rashtriya Lok Samata Party, was recognised as one of the principal reason behind reduction in support base of the party in many constituencies. In a bid to retain its support amongst its core vote base, the party made several organisational changes, like appointing Ramchandra Prasad Singh as national president of the party and Umesh Kushwaha as the state president. Meanwhile, it also tried to give effect to the merger of the Upendra Kushwaha led RLSP with itself. The RLSP was formed as a result of a split in JD(U) in 2013. Immediately after the merger, Upendra Kushwaha was made president of parliamentary board of the party.

On 20 February 2023, Upendra Kushwaha resigned from the post of president of parliamentary committee of JDU and membership of Bihar Legislative Council and formed another party named Rashtriya Lok Morcha as a breakaway faction of JDU.

However, Umesh Kushwaha, who was re-elected to the post of party&#x27;s state chief in November 2022, continued to serve party in that position for the second term.
===2024 Lok Sabha elections===

In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, JDU was granted 16 seats against Bharatiya Janata Party&#x27;s 17 seats and it contested in alliance with BJP and Chirag Paswan led Lok Janashakti Party (Ram Vilas). It won 12 seats in this election and played important role in formation of Third modi government in the centre. With this victory, JDU changed the narrative that it has been weakened over the time under the leadership of Nitish Kumar with latter&#x27;s growing age and lack of next generation of leaders in the party.

This election also revealed JDU&#x27;s hold and support base amongst the members of Extremely Backward Castes, which turned out to be the reason behind party&#x27;s spectacular performance in the constituencies dominated by them. In order to consolidate its support base amongst the different caste groups, JDU appointed Dileshwar Kamait, a member of Extremely Backward Caste as its leader of parliamentary party in 18th Lok Sabha, Sanjay Kumar Jha was appointed as leader of parliamentary party in Rajya Sabha after the 2024 general elections.

Subsequently, Lalan Singh and Ram Nath Thakur were made union ministers in Third Modi government from the JDU.

<text>Ion Ghica (; 12 August 1816 – 7 May 1897) was a Romanian statesman, mathematician, diplomat and politician, who was Prime Minister of Romania five times. He was a full member of the Romanian Academy and its president many times (1876–1882, 1884–1887, 1890–1893 and 1894–1895). He was the older brother and associate of Pantazi Ghica, a prolific writer and politician.

==Early life and Revolution==
He was born in Bucharest, Wallachia, to the prominent Ghica boyar family, and was the nephew of both Grigore Alexandru Ghica (who was to become Prince of Wallachia in the 1840s and 1850s) and Ion Câmpineanu, a &quot;Carbonari&quot;-inspired radical. His father was Dimitrie (Tache) Ghica and his mother – Maria née Câmpineanu. 
Ion Ghica was educated in Bucharest and in Western Europe, studying engineering and mathematics in Mine School of Paris (France) from 1837 to 1840.

After finishing his studies in Paris, he left for Moldavia and was involved in the failed &quot;Frăția&quot; (&quot;Brotherhood&quot;) conspiracy of 1848, which was intended to bring about the union of Wallachia and Moldavia under one native Romanian leader, Prince Mihai Sturdza. Ion Ghica became a professor on geology and mineralogy and later professor on political economy at the Academia Mihăileană which was founded by the same Prince Sturdza in Iași (future University of Iași). He is considered the first great Romanian economist.

He joined the Wallachian revolutionary camp, and, in the name of the Provisional Government then established in Bucharest, went to Istanbul to approach the Ottoman Imperial government; he, Nicolae Bălcescu, and General Gheorghe Magheru were instrumental in mediating negotiations between the Transylvanian Romanian leader Avram Iancu and the Hungarian Revolutionary government of Lajos Kossuth.

==Prince of Samos==

While in Istanbul, he was appointed Bey (governor) of Samos (1854–1859), where he proved his leadership skills by extirpating local piracy (most of which was aimed at transports supplying the Crimean War). After completing the task, Ghica was awarded the honorary title of &quot;Bey of Samos&quot; by Sultan Abd-ul-Mejid I in 1856.

==Political career in Romania==

In 1859, after the union of Moldavia and Walachia had been effected, Prince Alexandru Ioan Cuza asked Ion Ghica to return. Later (1866), despite being trusted by Prince Cuza, Ghica took active part in the secret grouping that secured Cuza&#x27;s overthrow. He was the first prime minister under Prince of Romania (afterwards King of Romania) Carol of Hohenzollern.

In 1866, Ghica became the first chairman of the newly established Bank of Romania. He is also noted as one of the first major Liberal figures in the Kingdom of Romania, and one of the leaders of the incipient Liberal Party. His group&#x27;s radicalism, with its boyar leadership that had engineered the defunct Revolution, surfaced as republicanism whenever Carol approached the Conservatives; Ghica joined the anti-dynastic movement of 1870–1871 that had surfaced with the Republic of Ploiești. The matter of the Liberals&#x27; loyalty was ultimately settled 1876, with the exceptionally long Liberal Ministry of Ion Brătianu. In 1881, Ghica was appointed Romanian Minister in London, an office he retained until 1889; he died in Ghergani, Dâmbovița County.

Furthermore, Ghica was a member of the Macedo-Romanian Cultural Society.

==Works==
Beside his political distinction, Ion Ghica earned a literary reputation by writing his &quot;Letters&quot;, addressed to Vasile Alecsandri, his lifelong friend. Conceived and written during his residency in London, the letters depict the ancestral stage of Romanian society, as it appeared to be fading away.

He was also the author of &quot;Amintiri din pribegie&quot; (&quot;Recollections from Exile&quot;), in 1848, and of &quot;Convorbiri Economice&quot; (&quot;Conversations on Economics&quot;), dealing with major economic issues. He was the first to advocate the favoring of local initiatives over foreign investments in industry and commerce – to a certain extent, this took the form of protectionism (a characteristic of the Liberal Party throughout the coming period, and until World War II).

<text>The Rashtriya Janata Dal ( RJD; translation: National People&#x27;s Party) is an Indian political party, mainly based in the state of Bihar. The party was founded in 1997 by Lalu Prasad Yadav.

The party&#x27;s support base has traditionally been Other Backward Classes, Dalits and Muslims and it is considered a political champion of the lower castes. In 2008, RJD received the status of recognized national level party following its performance in north-eastern states. RJD was derecognised as a national party on 30 July 2010. Leading the Mahagathbandhan alliance with 105 MLAs, it is currently the official opposition in Bihar. RJD is part of Ruling Government in Jharkhand and Kerala with its allies in Mahagathbandhan (Jharkhand) and LDF respectively.

==History==
===Formation===
On 5 July 1997, Pappu Yadav, Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, Mohammad Shahabuddin, Abdul Bari Siddiqui, Kanti Singh, Mohammed Taslimuddin and Md Ali Ashraf Fatmi along with seventeen Lok Sabha MPs and eight Rajya Sabha MPs along with supporters gathered at New Delhi formed the new political party, &quot;Rashtriya Janata Dal&quot;. It was formed as breakaway of Janata Dal. Lalu Prasad was elected as the first president of RJD. It is a centre-left party.

In the March 1998 national elections, RJD won 17 Lok Sabha seats from Bihar but failed to make significant headway in any other state. Later that year, the party formed an alliance with Mulayam Singh Yadav&#x27;s Samajwadi Party as an anti-Bharatiya Janata Party secular coalition but the coalition failed in garnering any widespread support.

===In UPA===

In the October 1999 elections, RJD fought the election in alliance with Indian National Congress but lost 10 Lok Sabha seats including the seat of Lalu Prasad Yadav.

In the 2000 state elections, however, it performed well, winning a majority of the seats in the state assembly in Bihar. Continuing its upswing in electoral fortunes, the party won 24 Lok Sabha seats in the 2004 elections that it fought in alliance with Indian National Congress. It was a part of Indian National Congress led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) from 2004 - May 2009, wherein Lalu Yadav held the position of the Minister of Railways.

In February 2005 Bihar Legislative Assembly election RJD won only 75 seats and lost the power. In the state elections held later that year – as a result of no party being able to form a government and RJD continued its downward slide winning only 54 seats.

In 2009 Indian general election, the RJD broke its alliance from UPA when seat sharing talks failed. RJD formed its alliance with Ram Vilas Paswan&#x27;s Lok Janshakti Party and Mulayam Singh Yadav&#x27;s Samajwadi Party what the media has dubbed the &quot;Fourth Front&quot;. RJD performed poorly and won just four seats, all of them in Bihar. However, in 2010 Assembly election, the RJD did not continue their alliance with Samajwadi Party.

In the 2014 Indian general election, RJD came back to UPA and contested election in alliance with Indian National Congress and Nationalist Congress Party in Bihar. Out of 40 seats in Bihar, RJD will contest on 27 seats, INC on 12 and NCP on one. RJD won only four out of total forty Loksabha seats in Bihar.

==Organisation==
The party leadership consists of the following bodies.
===National President===
 Lalu Prasad Yadav  is the National President of RJD.

===National Vice President===
The national vice president members of the party Mangani Lal Mandal, Mohammad Ilyas Hussain, Ahmed Ashfaq Karim, Rabri Devi, Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, Shivanand Tiwary and Mehboob Ali Kaiser

National Secretary general: Abdul Bari Siddiqui.

National Treasurer: Sunil Kumar Singh

=== Political Affairs Committee ===
=== National Executive Committee ===
The national executive members of the party Lalu Prasad Yadav, Tejashwi Yadav, Tej Pratap Yadav, Misa Bharti, Prem Chandra Gupta, Manoj Jha, Abdul Bari Siddiqui and Ram Chandra Purve.

==The Mahagathbandhan (Grand Alliance) in Bihar==

On 14 April 2015, the RJD, Janata Dal (United), Janata Dal (Secular), the Indian National Lok Dal, Samajwadi Party, and Samajwadi Janata Party (Rashtriya) announced that they would merge into a new national Janata Parivar alliance in order to oppose the BJP, thus breaking their long time alliance with the INC. This would give the alliance 14 Lok Sabha seats and 30 Rajya Sabha seats.

On 7 May 2015, the RJD expelled Pappu Yadav for six years due to anti-RJD activities after speculation rose that he may join the Biju Janata Dal for the 2015 Bihar Legislative Assembly election but he formed a new party called Jan Adhikar Party.

In November 2015, RJD won the elections as party became the single largest party with 80 followed by Janata Dal (United) with 71 seats, BJP with 53 seats and Congress with 27 seats. In terms of vote share, BJP came first with 24.4%, followed by RJD with 18.4% and JD (U) with 16.8% and Congress got 6.7%. Janata Dal (United)&#x27;s Nitish Kumar became the Chief Minister and Lalu&#x27;s son Tejashwi Yadav became the Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar.

In July 2017, following the corruption cases against Tejashwi Yadav, Nitish Kumar asked Yadav to resign from the cabinet, which was refused by RJD. In order to protect his clean image towards corruption, Nitish Kumar resigned on 26 July 2017, ending RJD&#x27;s stake in Bihar government. What followed next was a coalition BJP and JDU as a result Nitish Kumar became the Chief Minister again whereas Sushil Modi, a prominent BJP leader became the Deputy Chief Minister.

Alliance between Indian National Congress and the RJD factioned in October 2021, when Tejashwi gave tickets to candidates in Bihar By-elections, where Congress was fixed to stand candidates.

In August 2022, the Mahagathbandhan, Janata Dal (United), Indian National Congress, Hindustan Awam Morcha and Left Front joined again to form 2/3rd Majority government in Bihar Legislative Assembly.

In January 2024, Nitish Kumar left the Mahagathbandhan once again and joined hands with the BJP. He later became the chief minister once again.

==Controversies and criticism==
Mohammad Shahabuddin, a leader of RJD, has been involved in several criminal cases. Shahabuddin has been accused of several murders, be it of political rivals, or police officers. Shahabuddin, through his lawyers, attempted to also intimidate the legal proceedings, which led to more criminal cases against him.

During Lalu Prasad Yadav&#x27;s tenure as Chief Minister, Bihar&#x27;s law and order was at lowest, kidnapping was on rise and private armies mushroomed. He was also criticized by opposition in the Shilpi-Gautam Murder case and the death of his daughter Ragini Yadav&#x27;s friend, Abhishek Mishra, in mysterious circumstances.

An investigation into the land-for-jobs scam has implicated Lalu Prasad, along with both of his sons, as well as his wife Rabri Devi and his daughter, in addition to their involvement in other corruption scandals. Tejashwi Yadav allegedly threatened Central Bureau of Investigation agents who were investigating him in another corruption case.

<text>Herbert Brownell Jr. (February 20, 1904 – May 1, 1996) was an American lawyer and Republican politician. From 1953 to 1957, he served as United States Attorney General in the administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower.

== Early life and education ==
Brownell, one of the seven children of Herbert and May Miller Brownell, was born in Nemaha County, Nebraska, near the town of Peru. His father, Herbert Brownell, was a professor and author at the Peru State Normal School in education and physical sciences. After graduating Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Nebraska in 1924, and, in his senior year, being a member of the Society of Innocents, Brownell attended Yale Law School, where he was president of the &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot;, earning his law degree in 1927. While at the University of Nebraska, he joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity.

Brownell&#x27;s brother, Samuel Brownell, served as U.S. Commissioner of Education from 1953 through 1956.

== Legal career ==
Brownell was admitted to the bar in New York and began his practice in New York City. In February 1929, he joined the law firm of Lord Day &amp; Lord in New York, and except for periods of government service, he remained with them until his retirement in 1989. He married Doris McCarter on June 16, 1934. They had four children (Joan Brownell, Ann Brownell, Thomas McCarter Brownell, and James Barker Brownell) and remained together until McCarter&#x27;s death on June 12, 1979. He married his second wife Marion Taylor in 1987, but the couple separated and divorced in December 1989.

His most important client was the famous Greek shipping billionaire Aristotle Onassis; immediately after the end of World War II, Onassis was eager to get his hands on the T2 tankers originally built for the wartime needs of the U.S. Navy. The tankers were eventually made available for sale, but because they were considered to have a militarily strategic value in the event of another war, they were being offered to American citizens only.

Brownell helped Onassis work out a scheme of dummy American corporations, thus allowing him to bypass the regulations and purchase the tankers through these dummy corporations. Later, as Attorney General, Brownell would be forced to switch sides under pressure from FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, and his Justice Department would indict Onassis (eventually Onassis and the U.S. government reached a settlement).

==State political career==
Besides his law practice, Brownell had a long and active political career as a Republican. He was a member of the New York State Assembly (New York Co., 10th district) in 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936 and 1937.

In 1942, he was the campaign manager for Thomas Dewey&#x27;s election as governor of New York. He also managed Dewey&#x27;s 1944 and 1948 campaigns for president. From 1944 to 1946, he was the chairman of the Republican National Committee, where he focused on modernizing it with advanced polling methods and fundraising techniques. He was credited by many as being instrumental in helping the Republicans to gain control of the US Congress in the 1946 midterm elections.

In 1952, Brownell played an important role in convincing General Dwight Eisenhower, then supreme allied commander in Europe, to run for President of the United States and worked in the Eisenhower campaign. Along with Dewey, Brownell was instrumental in Eisenhower&#x27;s selection of Richard Nixon as the vice-presidential running mate.

==Attorney General==
Brownell was appointed by Eisenhower as Attorney General and served from January 21, 1953, to October 23, 1957. On November 6, 1953, Brownell told members of the Chicago Executives Club, &quot;Harry Dexter White was a Russian spy... He smuggled secret documents to Russian agents for transmission to Moscow.&quot; At the same time, he helped the Eisenhower administration cover up the Soviet Union&#x27;s involvement in the Korean War to prevent McCarthyist politicians from using it to raise popular support for a full-scale world war against the Soviet Union.

Early in his term, Brownell was involved in several landmark civil rights cases, including &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;.

Although it was weakened by the US Senate, he drafted the legislative proposal that ultimately became the Civil Rights Act of 1957, the first civil rights law that was enacted since 1875. Because of his strong stance in favor of civil rights, Brownell became very unpopular in the South.

Eisenhower reluctantly decided not to nominate Brownell to the Supreme Court when vacancies occurred in 1957 and 1958, as he feared that segregationists in the Senate would fight and defeat the nomination.

Brownell stepped down as an Attorney General only after his advice had been followed in the Little Rock desegregation case. Osro Cobb, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas, reflects on Brownell&#x27;s tenure:

==Later life==
In 1965, Brownell chaired a committee to find civilians, who would serve on the first impartial Civilian Complaint Review Board of the New York City Police Department, the first such citizen oversight of police in the country.

Brownell took himself out of consideration for appointment by President Richard Nixon as Chief Justice of the United States to replace Earl Warren in 1969, the eventual replacement being Warren E. Burger.

Brownell later served as the United States representative to the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague and from 1972 to 1974, he was special U.S. envoy to Mexico for negotiations over the Colorado River.

In addition to many honors and other civic roles, Brownell was also President of the New York City Bar Association in 1982. From 1986 to 1989 he served on the Commission for the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution. He died of cancer at the New York Hospital Cornell-Medical Center in Manhattan, New York, at 92.
