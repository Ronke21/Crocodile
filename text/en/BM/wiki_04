<text>In mathematics, the real projective plane, denoted or , is a two-dimensional projective space, similar to the familiar Euclidean plane in many respects but without the concepts of distance, circles, angle measure, or parallelism. It is the setting for planar projective geometry, in which the relationships between objects are not considered to change under projective transformations. The name &quot;projective&quot; comes from perspective drawing: projecting an image from one plane onto another as viewed from a point outside either plane, for example by photographing a flat painting from an oblique angle, is a projective transformation.

The fundamental objects in the projective plane are points and straight lines, and as in Euclidean geometry, every pair of points determines a unique line passing through both, but unlike in the Euclidean case in projective geometry every pair of lines also determines a unique point at their intersection (in Euclidean geometry, parallel lines never intersect). In contexts where there is no ambiguity, it is simply called the projective plane; the qualifier &quot;real&quot; is added to distinguish it from other projective planes such as the complex projective plane and finite projective planes.

One common model of the real projective plane is the space of lines in three-dimensional Euclidean space which pass through a particular origin point; in this model, lines through the origin are considered to be the &quot;points&quot; of the projective plane, and planes through the origin are considered to be the &quot;lines&quot; in the projective plane. These projective points and lines can be pictured in two dimensions by intersecting them with any arbitrary plane &quot;not&quot; passing through the origin; then the parallel plane which &quot;does&quot; pass through the origin (a projective &quot;line&quot;) is called the line at infinity. (See below.)

In topology, the name &quot;real projective plane&quot; is applied to any surface which is topologically equivalent to the real projective plane. Topologically, the real projective plane is compact and non-orientable (one-sided). It cannot be embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space without intersecting itself. It has Euler characteristic 1, hence a demigenus (non-orientable genus, Euler genus) of 1.

The topological real projective plane can be constructed by taking the (single) edge of a Möbius strip and gluing it to itself in the correct direction, or by gluing the edge to a disk. Alternately, the real projective plane can be constructed by identifying each pair of opposite sides of the square, but in opposite directions, as shown in the diagram. (Performing any of these operations in three-dimensional space causes the surface to intersect itself.)

== Examples ==
Projective geometry is not necessarily concerned with curvature and the real projective plane may be twisted up and placed in the Euclidean plane or 3-space in many different ways. Some of the more important examples are described below.

The projective plane cannot be embedded (that is without intersection) in three-dimensional Euclidean space. The proof that the projective plane does not embed in three-dimensional Euclidean space goes like this: Assuming that it does embed, it would bound a compact region in three-dimensional Euclidean space by the generalized Jordan curve theorem. The outward-pointing unit normal vector field would then give an orientation of the boundary manifold, but the boundary manifold would be the projective plane, which is not orientable. This is a contradiction, and so our assumption that it does embed must have been false.

=== The projective sphere ===
Consider a sphere, and let the great circles of the sphere be &quot;lines&quot;, and let pairs of antipodal points be &quot;points&quot;. It is easy to check that this system obeys the axioms required of a projective plane:
* any pair of distinct great circles meet at a pair of antipodal points; and
* any two distinct pairs of antipodal points lie on a single great circle.

If we identify each point on the sphere with its antipodal point, then we get a representation of the real projective plane in which the &quot;points&quot; of the projective plane really are points. This means that the projective plane is the quotient space of the sphere obtained by partitioning the sphere into equivalence classes under the equivalence relation ~, where if or . This quotient space of the sphere is homeomorphic with the collection of all lines passing through the origin in R3.

The quotient map from the sphere onto the real projective plane is in fact a two sheeted (i.e. two-to-one) covering map. It follows that the fundamental group of the real projective plane is the cyclic group of order 2; i.e., integers modulo 2. One can take the loop &quot;AB&quot; from the figure above to be the generator.

=== Projective hemisphere ===

Because the sphere covers the real projective plane twice, the plane may be represented as a closed hemisphere around whose rim opposite points are identified.
===Boy&#x27;s surface – an immersion===
The projective plane can be immersed (local neighbourhoods of the source space do not have self-intersections) in 3-space. Boy&#x27;s surface is an example of an immersion.

Polyhedral examples must have at least nine faces.

=== Roman surface ===

Steiner&#x27;s Roman surface is a more degenerate map of the projective plane into 3-space, containing a cross-cap.
A polyhedral representation is the tetrahemihexahedron, which has the same general form as Steiner&#x27;s Roman surface, shown here.

=== Hemi polyhedra ===
Looking in the opposite direction, certain abstract regular polytopes – hemi-cube, hemi-dodecahedron, and hemi-icosahedron – can be constructed as regular figures in the &quot;projective plane;&quot; see also projective polyhedra.

===Planar projections===
Various planar (flat) projections or mappings of the projective plane have been described. In 1874 Klein described the mapping:
: formula_1

Central projection of the projective hemisphere onto a plane yields the usual infinite projective plane, described below.

=== Cross-capped disk ===
A closed surface is obtained by gluing a disk to a cross-cap. This surface can be represented parametrically by the following equations:
:formula_2

where both &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; range from 0 to 2&quot;π&quot;.

These equations are similar to those of a torus. Figure 1 shows a closed cross-capped disk.

A cross-capped disk has a plane of symmetry that passes through its line segment of double points. In Figure 1 the cross-capped disk is seen from above its plane of symmetry &quot;z&quot; = 0, but it would look the same if seen from below.

A cross-capped disk can be sliced open along its plane of symmetry, while making sure not to cut along any of its double points. The result is shown in Figure 2.

Once this exception is made, it will be seen that the sliced cross-capped disk is homeomorphic to a self-intersecting disk, as shown in Figure 3.

The self-intersecting disk is homeomorphic to an ordinary disk. The parametric equations of the self-intersecting disk are:
: formula_3
where &quot;u&quot; ranges from 0 to 2&quot;π&quot; and &quot;v&quot; ranges from 0 to 1.

Projecting the self-intersecting disk onto the plane of symmetry (&quot;z&quot; = 0 in the parametrization given earlier) which passes only through the double points, the result is an ordinary disk which repeats itself (doubles up on itself).

The plane &quot;z&quot; = 0 cuts the self-intersecting disk into a pair of disks which are mirror reflections of each other. The disks have centers at the origin.

Now consider the rims of the disks (with &quot;v&quot; = 1). The points on the rim of the self-intersecting disk come in pairs which are reflections of each other with respect to the plane &quot;z&quot; = 0.

A cross-capped disk is formed by identifying these pairs of points, making them equivalent to each other. This means that a point with parameters (&quot;u&quot;, 1) and coordinates formula_4 is identified with the point (&quot;u&quot; + π, 1) whose coordinates are formula_5. But this means that pairs of opposite points on the rim of the (equivalent) ordinary disk are identified with each other; this is how a real projective plane is formed out of a disk. Therefore, the surface shown in Figure 1 (cross-cap with disk) is topologically equivalent to the real projective plane &quot;RP&quot;2.

== Homogeneous coordinates ==

The points in the plane can be represented by homogeneous coordinates. A point has homogeneous coordinates [&quot;x&quot; : &quot;y&quot; : &quot;z&quot;], where the coordinates [&quot;x&quot; : &quot;y&quot; : &quot;z&quot;] and [&quot;tx&quot; : &quot;ty&quot; : &quot;tz&quot;] are considered to represent the same point, for all nonzero values of &quot;t&quot;. The points with coordinates [&quot;x&quot; : &quot;y&quot; : 1] are the usual real plane, called the finite part of the projective plane, and points with coordinates [&quot;x&quot; : &quot;y&quot; : 0], called points at infinity or ideal points, constitute a line called the line at infinity. (The homogeneous coordinates [0 : 0 : 0] do not represent any point.)

The lines in the plane can also be represented by homogeneous coordinates. A projective line corresponding to the plane in R3 has the homogeneous coordinates (&quot;a&quot; : &quot;b&quot; : &quot;c&quot;). Thus, these coordinates have the equivalence relation (&quot;a&quot; : &quot;b&quot; : &quot;c&quot;) = (&quot;da&quot; : &quot;db&quot; : &quot;dc&quot;) for all nonzero values of &quot;d&quot;. Hence a different equation of the same line &quot;dax&quot; + &quot;dby&quot; + &quot;dcz&quot; = 0 gives the same homogeneous coordinates. 
A point [&quot;x&quot; : &quot;y&quot; : &quot;z&quot;] lies on a line (&quot;a&quot; : &quot;b&quot; : &quot;c&quot;) if &quot;ax&quot; + &quot;by&quot; + &quot;cz&quot; = 0. 
Therefore, lines with coordinates (&quot;a&quot; : &quot;b&quot; : &quot;c&quot;) where &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; are not both 0 correspond to the lines in the usual real plane, because they contain points that are not at infinity. The line with coordinates (0 : 0 : 1) is the line at infinity, since the only points on it are those with &quot;z&quot; = 0.

=== Points, lines, and planes ===

A line in P2 can be represented by the equation &quot;ax&quot; + &quot;by&quot; + &quot;cz&quot; = 0. If we treat &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;c&quot; as the column vector ℓ and &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot; as the column vector x then the equation above can be written in matrix form as:
: xTℓ = 0 or ℓTx = 0.

Using vector notation we may instead write x ⋅ ℓ = 0 or ℓ ⋅ x = 0.

The equation &quot;k&quot;(xTℓ) = 0 (which k is a non-zero scalar) sweeps out a plane that goes through zero in R3 and &quot;k&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) sweeps out a line, again going through zero. The plane and line are linear subspaces in R3, which always go through zero.
=== Ideal points ===
In P2 the equation of a line is and this equation can represent a line on any plane parallel to the &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; plane by multiplying the equation by &quot;k&quot;.

If we have a normalized homogeneous coordinate. All points that have &quot;z&quot; = 1 create a plane. Let&#x27;s pretend we are looking at that plane (from a position further out along the &quot;z&quot; axis and looking back towards the origin) and there are two parallel lines drawn on the plane. From where we are standing (given our visual capabilities) we can see only so much of the plane, which we represent as the area outlined in red in the diagram. If we walk away from the plane along the &quot;z&quot; axis, (still looking backwards towards the origin), we can see more of the plane. In our field of view original points have moved. We can reflect this movement by dividing the homogeneous coordinate by a constant. In the adjacent image we have divided by 2 so the &quot;z&quot; value now becomes 0.5. If we walk far enough away what we are looking at becomes a point in the distance. As we walk away we see more and more of the parallel lines. The lines will meet at a line at infinity (a line that goes through zero on the plane at ). Lines on the plane when are ideal points. The plane at is the line at infinity.

The homogeneous point is where all the real points go when you&#x27;re looking at the plane from an infinite distance, a line on the plane is where parallel lines intersect.
=== Duality ===

In the equation there are two column vectors. You can keep either constant and vary the other. If we keep the point x constant and vary the coefficients ℓ we create new lines that go through the point. If we keep the coefficients constant and vary the points that satisfy the equation we create a line. We look upon x as a point, because the axes we are using are &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot;. If we instead plotted the coefficients using axis marked &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; points would become lines and lines would become points. If you prove something with the data plotted on axis marked &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; the same argument can be used for the data plotted on axis marked &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;c&quot;. That is duality.
==== Lines joining points and intersection of lines (using duality) ====
The equation calculates the inner product of two column vectors. The inner product of two vectors is zero if the vectors are orthogonal. In P2, the line between the points x1 and x2 may be represented as a column vector ℓ that satisfies the equations and , or in other words a column vector ℓ that is orthogonal to x1 and x2. The cross product will find such a vector: the line joining two points has homogeneous coordinates given by the equation . The intersection of two lines may be found in the same way, using duality, as the cross product of the vectors representing the lines, .

== Embedding into 4-dimensional space ==
The projective plane embeds into 4-dimensional Euclidean space. The real projective plane P2(R) is the quotient of the two-sphere
: S2 = {(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;) ∈ R3 : &quot;x&quot;2 + &quot;y&quot;2 + &quot;z&quot;2 = 1}
by the antipodal relation . Consider the function given by . This map restricts to a map whose domain is S2 and, since each component is a homogeneous polynomial of even degree, it takes the same values in R4 on each of any two antipodal points on S2. This yields a map . Moreover, this map is an embedding. Notice that this embedding admits a projection into R3 which is the Roman surface.

== Higher non-orientable surfaces ==
By gluing together projective planes successively we get non-orientable surfaces of higher demigenus. The gluing process consists of cutting out a little disk from each surface and identifying (&quot;gluing&quot;) their boundary circles. Gluing two projective planes creates the Klein bottle.

The article on the fundamental polygon describes the higher non-orientable surfaces.

<text>Daniel Gluckstein (born 3 March 1953 in Paris) is a French Trotskyist politician best known for running in the French presidential election of 2002 as the candidate of the Workers&#x27; Party (&quot;Parti des Travailleurs&quot;, PT).

==Biography==
In 1968, he joined the Revolutionary Communist Youth (JCR). Then in 1979, he founded the Communist League Internationalist (LCI). In 1991, he was nominated National Secretary of the Parti des Travailleurs. In 1994, as lead candidate of the Parti des Travailleurs for the European elections, he obtained 0.43% of the vote. He was candidate for the legislative elections in Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis in 1997. In April 2002, he was candidate in the presidential election, and gained 0.47% of the vote, which made him the last of sixteen candidates in the first round.

In June 2008, he created the Parti Ouvrier Indépendant together with Gérard Schivardi.

In 2015, he co-founded the new Workers&#x27; Party.

<text>Cultural Amnesia (CA) are an English post-punk music group, first active between 1979 and 1983 as participants in the so-called cassette culture of the late 1970s and early 1980s in the UK. During this first period the band released three cassette albums: &quot;Video Rideo&quot; (1981), &quot;The Uncle of the Boot&quot; (1983) and &quot;Sinclair&#x27;s Luck&quot; (1983) on English and German record labels, and contributed to a number of compilation albums. Early on in his career, CA worked with the late Geff Rushton (John Balance) of Coil, who wrote a handful of songs for them and who was an important supporter and enabler due to his contacts as editor of &quot;Stabmental&quot; magazine, arranging most of their releases and providing constant encouragement. The band has become more widely known since 2000 following release of a number of compilations of their early &#x27;80s music in which the members of the group have been fully involved. Since the late &#x27;90s the band has also been occasionally active in the recording of new music and there have been a number of releases of new material since the early 2000s.

Working in the wake of the early industrial bands, CA&#x27;s output is diverse, ranging from ambient soundscapes to synthpop, but it can be broadly characterized as song-based electronic music, normally making use of synthesizer, drum machine and guitar. The three members of the band were occasionally joined for recording and live performance by guitarist, Alastair Murray. The band’s methods of recording, as with many of those involved with the cassette/DIY scene of the post-punk period, were initially extremely primitive, growing more sophisticated as they could afford better equipment. However, CA never recorded in a professional studio of any kind. The members of the band had little interest in punk, but in addition to the inspiration of bands such as Throbbing Gristle and Cabaret Voltaire they enjoyed a broad range of music of the post-punk period; they also listened a great deal to the art rock of the late &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s, including Krautrock and progressive rock, and had a keen interest in dance music and disco.

Cultural Amnesia stopped activity close to the completion of what was to be their first vinyl LP, &quot;Obscenity&quot;, with the German company Datenverarbeitung. John Balance&#x27;s sleeve notes for the unreleased album give a perceptive insight into CA’s body of work (the blurb was published on the inner sleeve of the 2007 compilation LPs, &quot;Press My Hungry Button&quot;).

What does one say? Cultural Amnesia have never ceased to amaze me with their finely honed songs of innocence and insecticide. Each gleaming tune a button on their hair shirt. There is a raw spirit of experiment, of mis-adventure with emotions, that is almost awkward to listen to. Time shifts and personal twists reveal a complex web of older children, playing with something they know full well is not really for the general public. Using a vocabulary of myths and symbols, along with splintered shards of themselves, caricatures and alter egos weave and parade in drunken &#x27;night on the town&#x27; scenarios, in crazy-glass-house confrontations with each other. All life is here. Bitter and sweet. Love, sex behind supermarkets, truth and lies, jealousy and an all-pervading earthy magick. And Death. Having lurked in the herbaceous borders of the DIY cassette scene, earning critical acclaim for their numerous releases, this record now marks the edge of that dark, tangled frustration of a country. Beyond... is another day. – John Balance, the Ides of March 1983

After fifteen years of silence the band produced three new tracks in 1998, and in 2003 launched a website. Their resumption of activity coincided with renewed interest in what has become known as &#x27;cassette culture&#x27; and the emergence of specialist labels, of which Vinyl On Demand is the best known, dedicated to reissuing on LP and CD material originally released on cassette in the late 1970s and early &#x27;80s. Having launched a website in 2003, the band began to receive inquiries from labels. &quot;Enormous Savages&quot;, a compilation of material from 1981–1983, was released on LP in the summer of 2007, early sales accompanied by a four-track mini-CD of material recorded 1998–2006. &quot;Press My Hungry Button&quot;, a 30-track double-LP compilation of 1980–1983 material, was released November 2007, early sales accompanied by a four-track EP of further 1980s material. The CD &quot;Enormous Savages Enlarged&quot;, from April 2009, includes five tracks recorded 2004–09 and a further &#x27;80s track in addition to the material that appeared on the LP. These compilations of 1980s material were well received in print and online, with &quot;Enormous Savages&quot; described in &quot;The Sound Projector&quot; as &quot;a remarkable piece of musical archaeology and certainly one of the reissues of the year&quot;. In November 2011 the band released &quot;This Is Not Your Shape&quot;, their first full album of new material since the early 1980s. The album was accompanied by a highly designed A4 lyrics booklet, &quot;Verbose Logging&quot;, including the songs on the album and others recorded during their second period. A special-edition CD of the album was released September 2012, with an additional track, booklet, postcards and a lapel badge. Two further albums and two EPs of new material have been released since then. A number of videos for both new and old material have been produced by John Peacock of the band. (Please see the discography below for further information and references.)

Although the 2007 compilation LPs collected many of the best of the band&#x27;s 1980s recordings, a considerable amount of material remains unreleased. The CA website is an extensive source of information on the band&#x27;s output (concentrated on their early-&#x27;80s period), released and unreleased, and on the early-&#x27;80s milieu in which they were first active. There is also much unreleased material recorded since their 1998 &quot;intermittent&quot; reformation.

John Peacock and Ben Norland (the latter as themilgramobediencetoauthorityexperiment (&quot;sic&quot;)) are active as solo artists.

<text>The &quot;Lewis and Clark&quot; class of dry cargo ship is a class of 14 underway replenishment vessels operated by the United States Navy&#x27;s Military Sealift Command. The ships in the class are named after famous American explorers and pioneers.

==Development==

&quot;Lewis and Clark&quot;-class ships replaced the existing eighteen &quot;Mars&quot;- and &quot;Sirius&quot;-class combat store ships and the s. When operating in concert with a the &quot;Lewis and Clark&quot;s have replaced the s.
The first of the fourteen ships, , was placed in service with the Military Sealift Command (MSC) in June 2006. The ships were built to commercial rather than military standards. This was done to minimize costs and to demonstrate the ability to competitively build ships on the civilian market. Though the ships are built to commercial standards they are equipped with various features to increase survivability in a hostile environment, including degaussing, shock hardening in certain equipment, emergency power and communication systems, and increased damage control capability in areas such as firefighting and stability. The ships are equipped with passive defenses to protect against mines and torpedoes and have ABC (atomic, biological, and chemical) countermeasures; the ships also have space and weight reservations for additional self-defense armament. The ships in the class are named after famous American explorers and pioneers.
NASSCO was awarded a detailed design and construction contract in October 2001. The fourteenth ship of the class was delivered on 24 October 2012. As the class entered serial production, NASSCO has increased learning and production efficiencies to make substantial reductions in labor hours, from hull to hull. For example, T-AKE-7 was produced with fewer than 50 percent of the worker-hours it took to produce T-AKE-1, and had a 37 percent reduction in total construction time.

==Mission==
As part of Military Sealift Command’s (MSC) Naval Fleet Auxiliary Force (NFAF), the ship&#x27;s mission is to deliver ammunition, provisions, stores, spare parts, potable water and petroleum products to carrier battle groups and other naval forces, serving as a shuttle ship or station ship. T-AKE-1 and -2 were assigned to one of the two active Maritime Prepositioning Ship squadrons, which are permanently forward deployed to the Western Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean. While identical in configuration to T-AKE-3 to -14, their mission is to provide selective offload of cargo for resupply and sustainment of U.S. Marine Corps forces ashore.
In their primary mission role, the T-AKEs provide logistic lift to deliver cargo (ammunition, food, limited quantities of fuel, repair parts and ship store items) to U.S. and allied ships at sea. In their secondary mission, the T-AKEs may be required to operate in concert with a &quot;Henry J. Kaiser&quot;-class (T-AO 187) fleet replenishment oiler as a substitute station ship to provide direct logistics support to the ships within a carrier strike group.

== History ==
On 8 February 2008, dry cargo/ammunition ship USNS &quot;Lewis and Clark&quot;, the first ship in Military Sealift Command&#x27;s newest class of ships, returned to Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia, after its first deployment.

The ship successfully completed a six-month tour to the U.S. Central Command area of operations to resupply U.S. Navy ships, providing logistics support in the Persian Gulf, around the Horn of Africa, along the length of Somalia and beyond the equator.

USNS &quot;Sacagawea&quot; (T-AKE-2) got underway for its first deployment 11 December 2008 in the U.S. Navy&#x27;s 5th Fleet area of operations.

USNS &quot;Richard E. Byrd&quot; (T-AKE-4) entered the U.S. Navy&#x27;s 7th Fleet area of operations 24 July 2008, marking the arrival of the first &quot;Lewis and Clark&quot;-class combat logistics support ship in service to the region.

<text>USS &quot;Lewis and Clark&quot; (SSBN-644), a ballistic missile submarine, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the explorers Meriwether Lewis (1774–1809) and William Clark (1770–1838), who carried out the Lewis and Clark Expedition of 1804–06.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to construct &quot;Lewis and Clark&quot; was awarded on 1 November 1962, and her keel was laid down by Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company at Newport News, Virginia, on 29 July 1963. She was launched on 21 November 1964, sponsored by Mrs. M. F. Engman and Mrs. M. G. Sale, and commissioned on 22 December 1965 with Commander John F. Fagan, Jr., in command of the Blue Crew and Commander Kenneth A. Porter in command of the Gold Crew.

==Service history==
After shakedown and missile firing off Cape Kennedy, Florida, in 1966, &quot;Lewis and Clark&quot; began deterrent patrols, armed with Polaris A3 ballistic missiles.

:&quot;History needed for 1969–72.&quot;

On 21 July 1972, &quot;Lewis and Clark&quot; completed conversion of her ballistic missile tubes to carry Poseidon C3 ballistic missiles. On 18 December 1972, the Gold Crew successfully launched one Poseidon C-3 missile in support of &quot;Lewis and Clark&quot;″s Demonstration and Shakedown Operation (DASO).

:&quot;History for 1972–73 needed.&quot;

On 8 April 1973, &quot;Lewis and Clark&quot; deployed for an operational deterrent patrol.

:&quot;History needed for 1973–81.&quot;

On 19 June 1981, &quot;Lewis and Clark&quot; successfully fired four Poseidon C-3 missiles in a Follow-on Operational Test. On 23 July 1981, she began a Poseidon refueling overhaul at Newport News Shipbuilding.

:&quot;History needed for 1981–85.&quot;

On 13 June 1985, &quot;Lewis and Clark&quot; successfully launched four Poseidon C-3 missiles in a Follow-on Operational Test.

:&quot;History needed for 1985–91.&quot;

==Deactivation, decommissioning, and disposal==
Deactivated while still in commission on 1 October 1991, &quot;Lewis and Clark&quot; was decommissioned on 27 June 1992 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 August 1992. Her scrapping via the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Bremerton, Washington began on 1 October 1995 and was completed on 23 September 1996.

==Commemoration==
&quot;Lewis and Clark&quot;&#x27;s sail and fairwater planes and the top of her rudder are on display at the Patriots Point Naval and Maritime Museum in Mt Pleasant, South Carolina, part of a memorial to the officers and men of the U.S. Navy Submarine Service who served during the Cold War.

<text>John Egerton Christmas Piper CH (13 December 1903 – 28 June 1992) was an English painter, printmaker and designer of stained-glass windows and both opera and theatre sets. His work often focused on the British landscape, especially churches and monuments, and included tapestry designs, book jackets, screen prints, photography, fabrics and ceramics. He was educated at Epsom College and trained at the Richmond School of Art followed by the Royal College of Art in London. He turned from abstraction early in his career, concentrating on a more naturalistic but distinctive approach, but often worked in several different styles throughout his career.

Piper was an official war artist in World War II and his wartime depictions of bomb-damaged churches and landmarks, most notably those of Coventry Cathedral, made Piper a household name and led to his work being acquired by several public collections. Piper collaborated with many others, including the poets John Betjeman and Geoffrey Grigson on the Shell Guides, the potter Geoffrey Eastop and the artist Ben Nicholson. In his later years, he produced many limited-edition prints.

==Biography==
===Early life===
John Piper was born in Epsom, Surrey, the youngest of three sons of the solicitor Charles Alfred Piper and his wife Mary Ellen Matthews. Charles Alfred Piper&#x27;s father, Charles Christmas Piper, had taken over the family bootmaking business, and was also a partner in a printing and stationery company. During Piper&#x27;s childhood, Epsom was still largely countryside. He went exploring on his bicycle and drew and painted pictures of old churches and monuments on the way. He started making guide books complete with pictures and information at a young age. Piper&#x27;s brothers both served in the First World War and one of them was killed at Ypres in 1915.
John Piper attended Epsom College from 1919. He did not like the college but found refuge in art. When he left Epsom College in 1922, Piper published a book of poetry and wanted to study to become an artist. However, his father disagreed and insisted he join the family law firm, Piper, Smith &amp; Piper in Westminster. Piper worked beside his father in London for three years, and took articles, but refused the offer of a partnership in the firm. This refusal cost Piper his inheritance but left him free to attend Richmond School of Art. At Richmond, the artist Raymond Coxon prepared Piper for the entrance exams for the Royal College of Art, which he entered in 1928. While studying at Richmond, Piper met Eileen Holding, a fellow student, whom he married in August 1929.

===1930s===
Piper disliked the regime at the Royal College of Art and left in December 1929. Piper and his wife lived in Hammersmith and held a joint exhibition of their artworks at Heal&#x27;s in London in 1931. Piper also wrote art and music reviews for several papers and magazines, notably &quot;The Nation and Athenaeum&quot;. One such review, of the artist Edward Wadsworth&#x27;s work, led to an invitation from Ben Nicholson for Piper to join the Seven and Five Society of modern artists. In the following years Piper was involved in a wide variety of projects in several different media. As well as abstract paintings, he produced collages, often with the English landscape or seaside as the subject. He drew a series on Welsh nonconformist chapels, produced articles on English typography and made arts programmes for the BBC. He experimented with placing constructions of dowelling rods over the surface of his canvases and with using mixtures of sand and paint.

With Myfanwy Evans, Piper founded the contemporary art journal &quot;Axis&quot; in January 1935. As the art critic for &quot;The Listener&quot;, through working on &quot;Axis&quot; and by his membership of the London Group and the Seven and Five Society, Piper was at the forefront of the modernist movement in Britain throughout the 1930s. In 1935 Piper and Evans began documenting Early English sculptures in British churches. Piper believed that Anglo-Saxon and Romanesque sculptures, as a popular art form, had parallels with contemporary art. Through Evans, Piper met John Betjeman in 1937 and Betjeman asked Piper to work on the Shell Guides he was editing. Piper wrote and illustrated the guide to Oxfordshire, focusing on rural churches. In March 1938 Stephen Spender asked Piper to design the sets for his production of &quot;Trial of a Judge&quot;. Piper&#x27;s first one-man show in May 1938 included abstract paintings, collage landscapes and more conventional landscapes. His second in March 1940 at the Leicester Galleries, featuring several pictures of derelict ruins, was a sell-out.

Piper had first met Myfanwy Evans in 1934 and early the next year when his wife Eileen left him for another artist, Piper and Evans moved into an abandoned farmhouse at Fawley Bottom in the Chilterns near Henley-on-Thames. The farmhouse had no mains electricity, no mains water and no telephone connection. They married in 1937. They gradually converted the farm&#x27;s outbuildings to studios for their artworks, but it was not until the 1960s that they could afford to modernise the property.

===World War II===

At the start of the Second World War, Piper volunteered to work interpreting aerial reconnaissance photographs for the Royal Air Force, but was persuaded by Sir Kenneth Clark to work as an official war artist for the War Artists&#x27; Advisory Committee (WAAC), which he did from 1940 to 1944 on short-term contracts. Piper was one of only two artists, the other being Meredith Frampton, commissioned to paint inside Air Raid Precaution (ARP) control rooms. Early in 1940 Piper was secretly taken to the ARP underground centre in Bristol, where he painted two pictures.

In November 1940 Piper persuaded the WAAC committee that he should be allowed to concentrate on painting bombed churches. This may have reflected his pre-war conversion to the Anglican faith as much as his previous interest in depicting derelict architectural ruins. The terms of this commission meant Piper would be visiting bombed cities, and other sites, as soon as possible after an air raid: often &quot;the following morning, before the clearing up&quot;. Hence he arrived in Coventry the morning after the Coventry Blitz air raid of 14 November 1940 that resulted in 1000 casualties and the destruction of the medieval Coventry Cathedral. Piper made drawings of the cathedral and other gutted churches in the city which he subsequently worked up into oil paintings in his studio. Piper&#x27;s first painting of the bombed cathedral, &quot;Interior of Coventry Cathedral&quot;, now exhibited at the Herbert Art Gallery, was described by Jeffery Daniels in &quot;The Times&quot; as &quot;all the more poignant for the exclusion of a human element&quot;. Piper&#x27;s depiction of the east end of the cathedral was printed as a post-card during the war and sold well. In 1962 the same image was used on the cover of the official souvenir guide to the cathedral.
After the bombing raids of 24 November 1940 on Bristol, Piper arrived in the city a day, or possibly two, later. Piper only spent a few hours in the city, but his sketches resulted, by January 1941, in three oil paintings of ruined churches: &quot;St Mary-le-Port, Bristol&quot;, &quot;The Temple Church&quot; and &quot;The Church of the Holy Nativity&quot;. Piper also painted bombed churches and other buildings in London and Newport Pagnell, and also spent a week painting in Bath after the Bath Blitz air raids in April 1942. During the summer of 1941, Piper featured in a group exhibition with Henry Moore and Graham Sutherland at Temple Newsam in Leeds. The show was a great success, attracting some 52,000 visitors before touring to other English towns and cities.

In 1943, the WAAC commissioned Piper to go to the disused slate mine at Blaenau Ffestiniog where the paintings from the National Gallery had been evacuated for safety during the Blitz. Piper found conditions in the underground quarry too difficult to work in but did paint some landscapes in the immediate area. He also toured North Wales by bicycle, cycling and climbing to photograph and sketch buildings and views in Harlech, in the Vale of Ffestiniog, on Cader Idris and on Aran Fawddwy. Piper had previously visited Snowdonia in 1939, 1940 and 1941, and often returned there after the war.

Piper was also commissioned by the WAAC to record a series of experiments on bomb shelter designs and land reclamation work. Alongside Vivian Pitchforth, he painted the bombed interior of the House of Commons. In July 1944 the WAAC appointed Piper to the full-time artist post vacated by John Platt at the Ministry of War Transport. In this role Piper painted rail and marine transport scenes in Cardiff, Bristol, Southampton and other south-coast locations. Earlier in the war, he had also painted at the locomotive works in Swindon.
Throughout the war Piper also undertook work for the Recording Britain project, initiated by Kenneth Clark, to paint historic sites thought to be at risk from bombing or neglect. He also undertook some private commissions during the war. Viscount Ridley commissioned him to produce a series of watercolours of Blagdon Hall and this led to a commission from the Royal Family for a series of watercolours of Windsor Castle and Windsor Great Park, which Piper completed by March 1942. The King, George VI was unimpressed with the dark tone of the pictures and commented, &quot;You seem to have very bad luck with your weather, Mr Piper&quot;.

Sir Osbert Sitwell invited Piper to Renishaw Hall to paint the house and illustrate an autobiography he was writing. Piper made the first of many visits to the estate in 1942. The family retain 70 of his pictures and there is a display at the hall. Piper painted a similar series at Knole House for Edward Sackville-West. In 1943, Piper received the first of several poster commissions from Ealing Studios. His draft poster for the film &quot;The Bells Go Down&quot; featured a view of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral seen among monumental ruins.

===Stained glass work===
From the early 1950s Piper began working in stained glass in partnership with Patrick Reyntiens, whom he had met through John Betjeman. Their first commission was for three windows for the chancel of the Chapel at Oundle School in Northamptonshire. Completed between 1953 and 1956, the nine lights, three to each window, feature individual images of Christ as King and Savior of the World. Setting the pattern for a partnership that would last into the 1980s, a closely collaborative process in which Piper provided the designs that Reyntiens would realize in glass.
The success of the Oundle windows led directly to Basil Spence commissioning Piper and Reyntiens to design the stained-glass window for the baptistry of the rebuilt Coventry Cathedral. Spence&#x27;s vision for the new cathedral required that it be filled with the best examples of modern British art, like a &quot;casket of jewels&quot;. Between 1955 and 1962, in collaboration with Spence, Piper and Reyntiens produced an original curtain of glass and reinforced concrete that climbs the full 26 meter height of the bowed baptistry wall. Architecturally integral to the building, it comprises 198 panes of glass, each combining to form an abstract design in a spectrum of colours ranging from white to deep blue. It remains Piper&#x27;s single most celebrated work of art.
Piper&#x27;s depiction of Jesus at Emmaus was installed above the high altar at Llandaff Cathedral in Cardiff in 1962, a commission received while working on the Coventry window. Commissions followed throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, primarily from patrons of memorial windows in parish churches across England. At St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Plymouth, Piper and Reyntiens were responsible for six windows, each individual and all installed between 1957 and 1968.
Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral, built between 1962 and 1967 by the architect Frederick Gibberd features, as an integral part of its design, an innovative stained glass lantern. Known as the &quot;Crown of Glass&quot; this was designed and manufactured by Piper and Reyntiens. The lantern panels were cemented together with epoxy resin within thin concrete ribs, a technique invented for the job. The idea for the design came from Reyntiens, who was inspired by a description from Dante&#x27;s Paradiso of the Holy Trinity as &quot;three great eyes of different colours each one winking at the other.&quot; 
One of Piper&#x27;s most original window commissions is not actually fabricated from glass at all. At the Church of All Saints, Clifton in Bristol, in 1967, Piper created windows depicting the &quot;Tree of Life&quot;, the &quot;River of Life&quot; and &quot;Creation&quot; from fiberglass panels specially created by Gillespie Associates in Farnham to Piper&#x27;s specification. Once in situ, Piper poured resins onto the panels creating large coloured sections without the use of ‘leads’ used in traditional stained glass. Piper described the process as akin to painting on canvas.
As well as their work for cathedrals and parish churches, Piper and Reyntiens also designed stained-glass windows for Eton College Chapel (1959–1964), the chapel of Nuffield College, Oxford (1960–1961), St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle (1969), and the chapel of Robinson College, Cambridge (1980). 

Piper&#x27;s and Reyntiens’ most significant overseas commission is installed in the narthex of Washington National Cathedral, a three-light window featuring the Tree of Life, a motif frequently deployed by Piper. It was unveiled in September 1974 as part of the dedication of the narthex beneath the Cathedral&#x27;s south-west tower to the memory of Sir Winston Churchill. The title given to the window is &quot;The Land Is Bright&quot;, taken from the final stanza of Arthur Hugh Clough&#x27;s 1849 poem, &quot;Say Not the Struggle Naught Availeth&quot;, which was quoted by Churchill in a 1941 radio broadcast.

Piper and Reyntiens also undertook secular commissions in glass. Of particular note is the abstract glazed screen produced for Arthur Sanderson&#x27;s new showroom on Berners Street in London in 1960. Back lit, its purpose is to disguise the lift shafts. The screen was retained and restored when the building was converted into a hotel in 2000.

In total, Piper designed over 60 stained glass window commissions. The majority were undertaken in partnership with Reyntiens, though in later years Piper worked with David Wasley and Joseph A Nuttgens, both of whom had trained in Reyntiens&#x27; studio. Piper&#x27;s last major commission - though not his last to be manufactured and installed - was his 1984 memorial window to John Betjeman in All Saints Church at Farnborough in Berkshire.

===Later life===
Piper made working visits to south Wales in both 1936 and 1939, and from 1943 to 1951, he made an annual painting trip to Snowdonia. He did not paint in the Welsh mountains after 1951 but did visit, and painted in Aberaeron in 1954. Piper&#x27;s Snowdonia paintings and drawings were exhibited in New York in September 1947 and in May 1950, on both occasions at Curt Valentin&#x27;s Galerie Buchholz. The former show was Piper&#x27;s first large solo show in the United States.
For the Festival of Britain in 1951, the Arts Council of Great Britain commissioned Piper to create a large mural, &quot;The Englishman&#x27;s Home&quot;, which consists of 42 plywood panels and depicted dwellings ranging from cottages to castles. The mural was displayed in a large open porch on the South Bank site for the duration of the festival. Not on public display for many years, in 2022 it was announced that the Rothschild Foundation has acquired the mural for Waddesdon Manor. Later in the 1950s, Piper produced pioneering designs for furnishing fabrics for Arthur Sanderson &amp; Sons Ltd and David Whitehead Ltd, as part of a movement to bring art and design to the masses. He also designed a number of dust jackets for books, frequently depicting both natural and architectural forms, often in a state of decay, within theatrical framing.
Piper was commissioned to design a number of large-scale mosaic works for public spaces in the early 1960s. The first was installed in the main lobby of Graham Dawbarn&#x27;s newly built BBC Television Centre in White City, London in 1960. Made from gloss-fired tiles, it is vibrantly colorful and entirely abstract. At the same time Piper worked on a second vivid abstract mosaic commissioned for the foyer of John Madin&#x27;s newly constructed Chamber of Commerce in Birmingham, completed the same year. In 1961, Piper finished his mural of the Meeting at Emmaus for the east wall of the newly built church for Harlow New Town in Essex. All three can still be seen in situ as of 2024.
In 1962, Piper&#x27;s 250ft mural for the porte cochère of Watson House, a laboratory complex in Fulham built 1959-1961 for the North Thames Gas Board, was unveiled. Entitled ‘The Spirit of Energy’, the mural consists of 32 fibreglass panels manufactured in partnership with Gillespie and Manzaroli Associates. They permit a contrast between opacity and translucence that allows for a closer interpretation of Piper&#x27;s abstract designs in gouache than more traditional materials might. Vacated in the 1980s, Watson House lay empty for over a decade until it was redeveloped for residential and commercial purposes in the late 1990s. It was renamed the &quot;Piper Building&quot; in honour of the artist on completion. The building and its murals were Grade II listed in 2022.

In 1966 Walter Hussey, the Dean of Chichester Cathedral, commissioned Piper to produce a tapestry to enliven the dark area around the high altar of the cathedral. Piper had designed the cope presented to Hussey when he left his previous post in 1955, and for Chichester he produced a very brightly coloured tapestry with an abstract design of the Holy Trinity flanked by the Elements and by the Evangelists. Although the tapestry received a mixed, mostly negative, reaction from the public, Piper was commissioned to create a set of clerical vestments to complement the work in 1967. A decade later, Piper provided designs for three tapestries for Hereford Cathedral depicting the Tree of Life, the Tree of Knowledge, and the Deposition. Made by artists in Namibia in 1976, they were installed in the south transept of the cathedral the following year. Also in 1976, for the Meeting House at the University of Sussex, Piper designed a large banner-like tapestry to adorn the organ loft, inspired by the university&#x27;s motto ‘Be still, and know’.

In 1968, Piper began making ceramic dishes and plates. At Fawley Bottom for many years, Piper shared a studio with the potter Geoffrey Eastop, who helped him with technical aspects of the process. A number of Piper&#x27;s ceramics are now in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

Piper continued to write extensively on modern art in books and articles. From 1946 until 1954, Piper served as a trustee of the Tate Gallery. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s he frequently visited Pembrokeshire to paint. He was a theatre set designer, including for the Kenton Theatre in Henley-on-Thames. He designed many of the premiere productions of Benjamin Britten&#x27;s operas at Glyndebourne Festival Opera, the Royal Opera House, La Fenice and the Aldeburgh Festival, as well as for some of the operas of Alun Hoddinott. Piper also designed firework displays, most notably for the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II in 1977.

Piper was made an Honorary Member of the Printmakers Council.

John Piper died on 28 June 1992 at his home at Fawley Bottom, Buckinghamshire, where he had lived since 1934. He was 88 years old. He was survived by his second wife, Myfanwy, who he had married in 1937. His children are Clarissa Lewis, the painter Edward Piper (deceased), Susannah Brooks and Sebastian Piper; his grandchildren include painter Luke Piper and sculptor Henry Piper.

==Legacy==

Since 2016, the River and Rowing Museum in Henley-on-Thames has maintained a permanent gallery dedicated to the life and work of John Piper. Situated in the nearest town to Piper&#x27;s home in Fawley Bottom, the gallery&#x27;s collection is built around a significant gift from the Piper estate, complemented by loans from public and private collections.

The Tate collection holds 180 examples of Piper&#x27;s work, including etchings and some earlier abstractions. Other collections holding Piper&#x27;s work include the Art Institute of Chicago, Ashmolean Museum, Beaverbrook Art Gallery, Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery, Bristol Museum &amp; Art Gallery, British Museum, Cheltenham Art Gallery and Museum, Cleveland Museum of Art, Currier Gallery of Art, Dallas Museum of Art, Fitzwilliam Museum, Glasgow Museums, Government Art Collection, The Hepworth Wakefield, Herbert Art Gallery and Museum, Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Hugh Lane Gallery, Imperial War Museum, Indianapolis Museum of Art, Laing Art Gallery, Leeds Art Gallery, Leicester Museum &amp; Art Gallery, Manchester Art Gallery, Museum of London, National Galleries of Scotland, National Gallery of Ireland, National Museum Cardiff, Pallant House Gallery, Parliamentary Art Collection, Philadelphia Museum of Art, The Priseman Seabrook Collection, Reading Museum, Southampton City Art Gallery, Ulster Museum, Usher Gallery, Victoria and Albert Museum, Winnipeg Art Gallery, The Whitworth, Wiltshire Museum, Wolverhampton Art Gallery, Yale Center for British Art and York Art Gallery.

Major retrospective exhibitions of Piper&#x27;s work have been held at Tate Britain (1983–84), the Dulwich Picture Gallery, the Imperial War Museum, the River and Rowing Museum, Museum of Reading and Dorchester Abbey. In 2012 an exhibition, &quot;John Piper and the Church&quot;, curated by Patricia Jordan Evans of Bohun Gallery, examined his relationship with the Church and his contribution to the development of modern art within churches. In 2016, the Pallant House Gallery mounted an exhibition entitled &quot;John Piper: The Fabric of Modernism&quot; which focused on Piper&#x27;s textile designs, while 2017/ 2018 saw Tate Liverpool and Mead Gallery at Warwick Arts Centre mount a joint exhibition focusing on Piper&#x27;s early career, with an emphasis on the 1930s and 1940s.

<text>The Governor&#x27;s School of North Carolina (GS, GSNC) is a publicly funded residential summer program for intellectually gifted high school students in the state of North Carolina, United States. North Carolina&#x27;s Governor&#x27;s School was the first such program in the United States, and has given rise to similar programs for gifted students in many other states.

==Program description==
Governor&#x27;s School enrolls approximately 800 students each summer, split between two host campuses. As of 2024, half attend Governor&#x27;s School West (GSW) at Greensboro College, and half attend Governor&#x27;s School East (GSE) at Meredith College in Raleigh. Governor&#x27;s School is a program of the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction.

Governor&#x27;s School serves students in public, private, and home schools. Most students are rising seniors in high school, though students from some arts areas may be rising juniors. Students who attend Governor&#x27;s School are nominated by their school or school system and selected on the basis of grades, test scores, an application essay and, for arts students, an audition. Students are accepted for a primary course of study, known as Area I, in which they will spend most of their class time. Area I disciplines include the following: academic areas of English, Spanish, mathematics, natural science and social science; artistic areas of art, choral music, dance, drama, and instrumental music. Each course emphasizes contemporary texts, compositions, artistic expressions, issues, and ideas in their respective disciplines. All students attend two additional areas of study outside of their primary area as well as optional and required seminars and performances. Area II courses cover a variety of questions and ideas from the epistemological branch of philosophy. In Area III classes, students attempt to ground what they are learning in their Area I and II classes in their own personal experience through the lens of ethics and values.

==Governor&#x27;s School history==
===Founding===
The program began in 1963 as an education initiative promoted by Gov. Terry Sanford and conceptualized by John Ehle, a member of his staff. The idea was based on educational principles concerning gifted education that were prominent in the 1950s. An early consultant in Governor&#x27;s School&#x27;s design and curriculum was Dr. James J. Gallagher, author of &quot;Teaching the Gifted Child (1951)&quot; and over 80 other works on gifted education. Dr. Gallagher&#x27;s work emphasized the need for different educational methods for gifted students that were not available in public schools, and the importance of creativity and leadership as aspects of giftedness. The goal of Governor&#x27;s School, therefore, was to advance the education of North Carolina&#x27;s brightest students, with the goal of encouraging them to become gifted, creative leaders in all aspects of science, mathematics, art, sociology, and literature. This was done partially in hopes of challenging the technological advancements being made in the Cold-War era Soviet Union, but also with an eye to bringing corporations to North Carolina to provide jobs in emerging technologies such as computers, space exploration, telecommunications, and biomedical research.

The first session was funded by a grant from the Carnegie Corporation of New York and an association of business leaders from Winston-Salem, NC. The first Governor&#x27;s School class of 400 students met in June, 1963 on the campus of Salem College in Winston-Salem, NC. Instructors were drawn mainly from college professors. Though North Carolina&#x27;s public schools would not be officially desegregated until 1968, students of all races have been accepted to Governor&#x27;s School since its inception.

===Establishment and growth===

Governor&#x27;s School was funded by the Carnegie Corporation and local business for a second year, but received support from the NC Legislature beginning in 1965 and continuing (with a single exception) to this day. While the subject matter changed with the times, the governing philosophies of gifted education remained focused on differential education for the gifted. The early curriculum was expressed in a document entitled &quot;Opening Windows to the Future&quot;, written by H. Michael Lewis with input from GS instructors.

In 1968, actor, educator, and playwright James Lee (Jim) Bray became Director of the Governor&#x27;s School, a position he would hold until 1995.

In light of the expanding population of North Carolina and the growing impact of research and development corporations in the state&#x27;s financial success, Governor Jim Hunt called for Governor&#x27;s School to be expanded to a second campus in 1978. The second GS program was held on the campus of St. Andrews Presbyterian College in Laurinburg. This doubled the number of students to 800. With the opening of this campus, the program in Winston-Salem was referred to as GS West, while Laurinburg was GS East. Both campuses held essentially the same program, prompting the NC Department of Public Instruction to declare that Governor&#x27;s School was one school with two campuses.

Governor&#x27;s School East moved to Meredith College in Raleigh for the 2000 session, where it is still held. In 2019, Governor&#x27;s School West moved from Salem College to High Point University in High Point. GSW was again moved, in 2022 to Winston Salem State University and in 2024 to Greensboro College. 

While faculty and subject matter have changed over time, Governor&#x27;s School remained basically unaltered from 1978 until 2009.

===Support organizations===
In response to proposed budget cuts, and in celebration of its 25th year, Jim Bray and the faculty at GS West organized a meeting of GS alumni to show legislators the enduring success of the program. Organized by long-time campus activities director JoAnne North Goetz, several hundred alumni met in 1987 to show their support for the program. During this meeting, they organized the North Carolina Governor&#x27;s School Alumni Association. The Alumni Association holds annual Alumni Day reunions on both campuses, and supports Governor&#x27;s School through donations and public awareness.

In 1993, the Alumni Association spun off a sister organization, the NC Governor&#x27;s School Foundation. The Foundation is a non-profit charitable organization that supports the mission of Governor&#x27;s School through direct financial donations. The GS Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization.

In 2020, the Alumni Association merged into the GS Foundation in order to expand opportunities for alumni.

===Budget challenges===
With the economic issues of the 2008 financial collapse, the North Carolina legislature began a series of cuts to the Governor&#x27;s School program. In 2009, the legislature passed a general cut to the Governor&#x27;s School budget, forcing the program to drop from 800 students to 600, and also began charging a $500 tuition to attend. Prior to that time, Governor&#x27;s School had been at no cost to the students. Since 2010, the Governor&#x27;s School Foundation has offered scholarships to economically disadvantaged students to offset the tuition cost.

Citing continued budget issues, the NC Legislature cut all funding for Governor&#x27;s School in June, 2011. With this decision, the Governor&#x27;s School of North Carolina was effectively ended, though the legislature did allow the Department of Public Instruction to keep the School open as a tuition-funded program. DPI made it clear from the beginning that they would not hold GS if it had to be supported by full tuition of about $2100 per student.

This prompted the Governor&#x27;s School Foundation into action to save the 2012 program and give alumni time to show legislators the economic power of Governor&#x27;s School and its positive impact on the state&#x27;s economy. Working with the Governor&#x27;s School Alumni Association, and with support from the Department of Public Instruction and the NC State Board of Education, the GS Foundation was able to raise $700,000 in less than six months - enough to keep both Governor&#x27;s School campuses open for the 2012 session with 550 students, although with a reduction in duration to five weeks. At the same time, an outpouring of support from alumni and business leaders across the state urged legislators to restore GS funding. In June 2012, the Legislature voted to restore sufficient funding to keep both GS campuses open with 600 students for a five-week session.

On July 14, 2012, the NC Governor&#x27;s School Alumni Association held a celebration of 50 years of Governor&#x27;s School, the culmination of the effort to save the program.

<text>John Stephen Piper (born January 11, 1946) is an American theologian and pastor in the Reformed Baptist tradition. He is also chancellor of Bethlehem College and Seminary in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Piper taught biblical studies at Bethel University for six years (1974–1980), before serving as pastor for preaching and vision of Bethlehem Baptist Church (Converge) in Minneapolis for 33 years (1980–2013).

Piper is the founder and senior teacher of Desiring God (desiringgod.org), named for his book &quot;Desiring God: Meditations of a Christian Hedonist&quot; (1986), and has written a number of award-winning books, including ECPA Christian Book Award winners &quot;Spectacular Sins&quot;, &quot;What Jesus Demands from the World&quot;, &quot;Pierced by the Word&quot;, and &quot;God&#x27;s Passion for His Glory&quot;, as well as bestsellers &quot;Don&#x27;t Waste Your Life&quot; and &quot;The Passion of Jesus Christ&quot;.

Piper has been extensively active online, particularly with his podcast &quot;Ask Pastor John&quot; in which he answers submitted questions. It has over 2,000 episodes.

==Biography==
Piper was born on January 11, 1946, in Chattanooga, Tennessee, to Bill and Ruth Piper. His father was a traveling evangelist for over 60 years. Before Piper was one year old, his family moved to Greenville, South Carolina, where he spent the remainder of his youth, graduating from Wade Hampton High School in 1964.

According to Piper, he had a religious conversion at his mother&#x27;s knee on a family vacation in Florida when he was six years old. Piper has remarked that the fact he was converted at the age of six &quot;blows him away&quot;, not because he remembers the event, but due to his belief in the Bible&#x27;s telling of the hopeless condition of all humans who have not been converted.

Piper married Noël Henry in December 1968, and together, they had four sons, a daughter, and twelve grandchildren. He studied at Wheaton College between 1964 and 1968, majoring in literature and minoring in philosophy. Studying romantic literature with Clyde Kilby led him to take particular interest in poetry, Piper has published several books of poetry, and continues to pursue, with his poetry, the deeper reality of personal, theological and social reality. He has explained in both prose and poetry why he writes. C. S. Lewis has remained a profound influence in Piper&#x27;s life, in large measure, Piper says, because of the &quot;combination of rational precision with language, and profound poetic perception of reality.&quot;

In the fall of 1966, Piper caught mononucleosis, and during this infection, he listened to the Pastor Harold John Ockenga on WETN, his college&#x27;s radio station. Piper dated his call to the ministry of God’s word to that experience: “I can remember listening there on my bed to his messages on the radio and feeling inside my heart simply explode with longing to be able to handle the word of God the way he was handling it in the pulpit at Edman Chapel. Before those three weeks were over, I had resolved to drop organic chemistry… That was, I believe, my call to the ministry of the word.”

However, the most formative season theologically was yet to come: three years under the tutelage of Daniel Payton Fuller, at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California, from 1968 to 1971. Fuller’s influence on Piper was, he admits with thankfulness, enormous. Three things that would mark Piper’s life-work are traceable to that influence: assiduous attention to exegetical detail in Bible study (indeed in all reading), a central conviction of the all-embracing sovereignty of God, and what Piper came to call Christian Hedonism.

Piper received his Doctor of Theology degree in New Testament studies at the University of Munich, Germany (1971–1974) under Leonhard Goppelt. His dissertation, &quot;Love Your Enemies&quot;, was published by Cambridge University Press and Baker Book House. Upon completion of his doctorate, Piper taught biblical studies at Bethel University in Saint Paul, Minnesota, for six years between 1974 and 1980.

Piper&#x27;s mother died on December 16, 1974, in a bus wreck in Israel. Following this incident in 1990, a tribute to her was included in Piper&#x27;s booklet &quot;What&#x27;s the Difference?&quot;

===Ministry===

In 1980, Piper became pastor of Bethlehem Baptist Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he ministered until March 31, 2013, as pastor for preaching and vision. Piper became involved in evangelical Christianity after the publication of his book &quot;Desiring God: Meditations of a Christian Hedonist&quot; in 1986 and has continued to publish dozens of books further articulating his theological perspective. In 1994, Piper founded Desiring God Ministries, with the aim of &quot;spread[ing] a passion for the supremacy of God in all things for the joy of all peoples through Jesus Christ.&quot; Desiring God Ministries offers all of Piper&#x27;s sermons and articles from the past three decades—and most of his books—online at no cost.

Piper took an eight-month leave of absence from his ministry from May 1, 2010, to January 9, 2011. He announced in June 2011 that he would soon step down from his role of pastor. A candidate to succeed him was announced in March 2012, and on May 20, 2012, Jason Meyer was voted in (784 yes to 8 no) to be the next pastor for preaching and vision, replacing Piper.

On March 31, 2013 (Easter Sunday), Piper preached his final sermon as pastor of Bethlehem Baptist and announced in an open letter to the congregation that he and his family would be moving to Tennessee for at least a year for the church&#x27;s new leadership to develop a strategic vision for the church without distractions. He still attends the church and is designated pastor emeritus with no official role in the church leadership.

Following his retirement from the active pastorship of his church, Piper has occupied himself with online work through his Desiring God ministries. He has become especially known for the Ask Pastor John podcast, in which he answers various Bible- and life-related questions submitted by listeners. He additionally works on a video series called &quot;Look at the Book&quot; (&quot;LAB&quot;) in which he annotates some portion of Scripture and goes through in-depth exegesis. In 2024, a condensed book version of the Ask Pastor John podcast (adapted by its host, Tony Reinke) was released.

He has sold millions of books but has donated 100% of the royalties from his books sales to various charities.

==Recognition==
In 2010, a &quot;Festschrift&quot; was published in his honor, entitled &quot;For the Fame of God&#x27;s Name: Essays in Honor of John Piper&quot;, including contributions from Don Carson, Sinclair Ferguson, G. K. Beale, Thomas R. Schreiner, Wayne Grudem, Al Mohler, C. J. Mahaney, Mark Dever, John MacArthur, and Bill Mounce.

In 2018, he was named one of the &quot;12 Most Effective Preachers in English&quot; by Baylor University.

== Personal life ==
He married Noël Henry in 1968 and had five children, including an adopted daughter. His son Abraham Piper has publicly criticized evangelical Christianity.

On January 11, 2006, Piper announced that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer. According to a letter sent to his church, he and his doctors believed that the cancer was fully treatable. Piper responded to his diagnosis with the following:

Piper underwent successful surgery on February 14, 2006.

<doc id="411352" wikidata="Q172724" url="?curid=411352" title="Bernie Ecclestone">
<text>Bernard Charles Ecclestone (born 28 October 1930) is a British business magnate, motorsport executive and former racing driver. Widely known in journalism as the &quot;F1 Supremo&quot;, Ecclestone founded the Formula One Group in 1987, controlling the commercial rights to Formula One until 2017.

Born in Suffolk and raised in Bexleyheath, Ecclestone began his business career trading automotive parts after World War II. He started racing in Formula Three in 1949, winning multiple races at Brands Hatch driving a Cooper Mk V. After purchasing two Connaught chassis in , Ecclestone entered the Monaco and British Grands Prix in Formula One as a privateer, but did not qualify at either. He then became a driver manager for Stuart Lewis-Evans and Jochen Rindt, the latter winning the World Drivers&#x27; Championship posthumously in . Ecclestone purchased Brabham in —who he operated for 15 years—leading the team to 22 victories, as well as two World Drivers&#x27; Championship titles with Nelson Piquet. He co-founded the Formula One Constructors&#x27; Association two years later, leading them through the FISA–FOCA war. 

His control of the sport, which grew from his pioneering sale of television rights in the late-1970s, was primarily financial; under the terms of the Concorde Agreement in 1987, Ecclestone and his companies also controlled the administration, setup and logistics of each Formula One Grand Prix. He also founded International Sportsworld Communicators in 1996, controlling the commercial rights to the World Rally Championship until 2000. Ecclestone placed fifth on the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Rich List in 2002, and declined both a CBE and a knighthood from Elizabeth II. Ecclestone co-owned association football club Queens Park Rangers with Flavio Briatore from 2007 to 2011, overseeing their promotion to the Premier League. Ecclestone sold the Formula One Group to Liberty Media in 2017, subsequently being appointed as chairman &quot;emeritus&quot; and adviser to the board of directors until his departure in 2020.

Over his four-decade career as an executive in Formula One, Ecclestone was involved in several controversies. With the birth of his son in 2020, he became the sixth-oldest father in human history, aged 89. In October 2023, Ecclestone was convicted of tax fraud at Southwark Crown Court, and agreed to pay HM Revenue and Customs over million in back taxes and penalties; he was sentenced to 17 months in prison, suspended for two years.

== Early life ==
Ecclestone was born on 28 October 1930 in St Peter South Elmham, a hamlet three miles south of Bungay. He was the son of Sidney Ecclestone, a fisherman, whose family was originally from Kent, and his wife Bertha Sophia (née Westley). Ecclestone attended primary school in Wissett in Suffolk before the family moved to Danson Road, Bexleyheath, southeast London, in 1938. He was not evacuated to the countryside during the Second World War and remained with his family.

Ecclestone left Dartford West Central Secondary School at the age of 16 to work as an assistant in the chemical laboratory at the local gasworks testing gas purity. He also studied chemistry at Woolwich Polytechnic and pursued his hobby of motorcycles.

== Motorsports career ==

=== Early career ===
Immediately after the end of the Second World War, Ecclestone went into business trading in spare parts for motorcycles, and formed the Compton &amp; Ecclestone motorcycle dealership with Fred Compton. His first racing experience came in 1949 in the 500cc Formula 3 Series, acquiring a Cooper Mk V in 1951.

He drove only a limited number of races, mainly at his local circuit, Brands Hatch, but achieved a number of good placings and an occasional win. He initially retired from racing following several accidents at Brands Hatch, intending to focus on his business interests.

=== Team ownership ===
After his accident, Ecclestone temporarily left racing to make a number of eventually lucrative investments in property and loan financing and to manage the Weekend Car Auctions firm.

He returned to racing in 1957 as manager of driver Stuart Lewis-Evans, and purchased two chassis from the disbanded Connaught Formula One team. Ecclestone even tried, unsuccessfully, to qualify a car himself at Monaco in 1958, although this has since been described as &quot;not a serious attempt&quot;.

He also entered the British Grand Prix, but the car was raced by Jack Fairman. He continued to manage Lewis-Evans when he moved to the Vanwall team; Roy Salvadori moved on to manage the Cooper team. Lewis-Evans suffered severe burns when his engine exploded at the 1958 Moroccan Grand Prix and died six days later; Ecclestone was shocked and once again retired from racing.

His friendship with Salvadori led to his becoming manager of driver Jochen Rindt and a partial owner of Rindt&#x27;s 1970 Lotus Formula 2 team, whose other driver was Graham Hill. Rindt, on his way to the 1970 World Championship, died in a crash at the Monza circuit, though he was awarded the championship posthumously.

=== Brabham ===
During the 1971 season, Ecclestone was approached by Ron Tauranac, owner of the Brabham team, who was looking for a suitable business partner. Ecclestone made him an offer of £100,000 for the whole team, which Tauranac eventually accepted. Tauranac stayed on as designer and to run the factory, while Colin Seeley was briefly brought in against Tauranac&#x27;s wishes to assist in design and management.

Ecclestone and Tauranac were both dominant personalities and Tauranac left Brabham early in the 1972 season. The team achieved little during 1972, as Ecclestone moulded the team to fit his vision of a Formula One team. He abandoned the highly successful customer car production business established by Jack Brabham and Tauranac – reasoning that to compete at the very front in Formula One you must concentrate all of your resources there. For the 1973 season, Ecclestone promoted Gordon Murray to chief designer. The young South African produced the triangular cross-section BT42, the first of a series of Ford-powered cars with which the Brabham team would take several victories in 1974 and 1975 with Carlos Reutemann and Carlos Pace.
Despite the increasing success of Murray&#x27;s nimble Ford-powered cars, Ecclestone signed a deal with Alfa Romeo to use its powerful but heavy flat-12 engine from the 1976 season. Although this was financially beneficial, the new BT45s were unreliable and the Alfa engines rendered them significantly overweight. The 1976 and 1977 seasons saw Brabham fall towards the back of the field again, before winning two races again in the 1978 season when Ecclestone signed the Austrian double world champion Niki Lauda, intrigued by Murray&#x27;s radical BT46 design.

The Brabham-Alfa era ended in 1979, the team&#x27;s first season with the up-and-coming young Brazilian Nelson Piquet when Alfa Romeo started testing its own Formula One car during that season. This prompted Ecclestone to revert to Cosworth DFV engines – a move Murray described as &quot;like having a holiday&quot;.

Piquet formed a close and long-lasting relationship with Ecclestone and the team, losing the title after a narrow battle with Alan Jones in 1980 and eventually winning in 1981 and 1983. In the summer of 1981 Brabham had tested a car powered by a BMW turbo engine, and 1982&#x27;s new BT50 was powered by BMW&#x27;s turbocharged four-cylinder M10. Brabham continued to run the Ford-powered BT49D in the early part of the season while reliability and driveability issues were sorted out by BMW and its technical partner Bosch. Ecclestone and BMW came close to splitting before the turbo car duly took its first win at the 1982 Canadian Grand Prix but the partnership took the first turbo-powered world championship in 1983.

The team continued to be competitive until 1985. At the end of the year, Piquet left after seven years. He was unhappy with the money that Ecclestone was willing to offer him and went to Williams where he would win his third championship. The following year, Murray, who since 1973 had designed cars that had scored 22 GP wins, left Brabham to join McLaren. Brabham continued under Ecclestone&#x27;s leadership to the end of the 1987 season, in which the team scored only eight points. BMW withdrew from Formula One after the 1987 season.

Having bought the team from Ron Tauranac for approximately $120,000 at the end of 1971, Ecclestone eventually sold it for over US$5 million to a Swiss businessman, Joachim Luhti in 1988.

=== Formula One executive ===
In parallel to his activities as team owner, Ecclestone formed the Formula One Constructors Association (FOCA) in 1974 with Frank Williams, Colin Chapman, Teddy Mayer, Ken Tyrrell, and Max Mosley. He became increasingly involved with his roles at FISA and the FOCA in the 1970s, in particular with negotiating the sport&#x27;s television rights, in his decades-long advocacy for team control.

Ecclestone became chief executive of FOCA in 1978 with Mosley as his legal adviser; together, they negotiated a series of legal issues with the FIA and Jean-Marie Balestre, culminating in Ecclestone&#x27;s famous coup, his securing the right for FOCA to negotiate television contracts for the Grands Prix. For this purpose Ecclestone established Formula One Promotions and Administration, giving 47% of television revenues to teams, 30% to the FIA, and 23% to FOPA (i.e. Ecclestone himself); in return, FOPA put up the prize money – &quot;grand prix&quot; could literally be translated from French as &quot;great prize&quot;.

Television rights shuffled between Ecclestone&#x27;s companies, teams, and the FIA in the late 1990s, but Ecclestone emerged on top again in 1997 when he negotiated the fourth Concorde Agreement: in exchange for annual payments, he maintained the television rights. Ecclestone and his companies also controlled the administration, setup and logistics of each Grand Prix.

Also in 1978, Ecclestone hired Sid Watkins as official Formula One medical doctor. Following the crash at the 1978 Italian Grand Prix, Watkins demanded that Ecclestone provide better safety measures, which were provided at the next race. This way, Formula One began to improve safety, decreasing the number of deaths and serious injuries along the decades.

At the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, following Ayrton Senna&#x27;s fatal accident but while Senna was still alive, Ecclestone inadvertently misinformed Senna&#x27;s family that Senna had died. Ecclestone had used a walkie-talkie to ask Sid Watkins - who was at the crash scene - about Senna&#x27;s condition. Over the static of the walkie-talkie, Ecclestone misheard Watkins&#x27; response of &quot;His head&quot; as &quot;He&#x27;s dead&quot;. Based on this, Ecclestone told Senna&#x27;s brother Leonardo, who was attending the race, that Senna had died. Senna in fact remained biologically alive for several more hours. This misunderstanding caused a rift in the hitherto friendly relations between Ecclestone and the Senna family; although Ecclestone travelled to Sâo Paulo at the time of Senna&#x27;s funeral, he did not attend the funeral itself, instead watching it on television at his hotel.

Despite heart surgery and triple coronary bypass in 1999, Ecclestone remained as energetic as always in promoting his own business interests. In the late 1990s he reduced his share in SLEC Holdings (owner of the various F1 managing firms) to 25%, though despite his minority share he retained complete control of the companies.

Ecclestone came under fire in October 2004 when he and British Racing Drivers&#x27; Club president Jackie Stewart were unable to come to terms regarding the future British Grand Prix, causing the race to be dropped from the 2005 provisional season calendar. Negotiations with Ecclestone to keep the race in Formula One ended in the signing of a contract on 9 December to guarantee the continuation of the British Grand Prix for the following five years. In mid-November 2004, the three banks comprising Speed Investments, which owns a 75% share in SLEC, which in turn controls Formula One – Bayerische Landesbank, J.P. Morgan Chase, and Lehman Brothers – sued Ecclestone for more control over the sport, prompting speculation that Ecclestone might altogether lose the control he had maintained for more than 30 years.

A two-day hearing began on 23 November. After the proceedings ended the following day, Justice Andrew Park announced his intention to reserve ruling for several weeks. On 6 December 2004, Park read his verdict, stating that &quot;In [his] judgment it is clear that Speed&#x27;s contentions are correct and [he] should therefore make the declarations which it requests.&quot; However, Ecclestone insisted that the verdict – seen almost universally as a legal blow to his control of Formula One – would mean &quot;nothing at all&quot;. He stated his intention to appeal against the decision. The following day, at a meeting of team bosses at Heathrow Airport in London, Ecclestone offered the teams a total of £260,000,000 over three years in return for unanimous renewal of the Concorde Agreement, which expired in 2008. Two weeks later, Gerhard Gribkowsky, a board member of Bayerische Landesbank and the chairman of SLEC, said that the banks had no intention to remove Ecclestone from his position of control.

Ecclestone saw 14 of 20 cars pull out of the 2005 United States Grand Prix at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The seven teams which refused to participate, stating concern over the safety of their Michelin tyres, requested rule changes and/or a change to the track configuration. Despite a series of meetings between Ecclestone, Max Mosley and the team principals, no compromise was reached by race time, and Ecclestone became an object of the public&#x27;s frustration at the resultant six-car race. Despite him not having caused the problem, fans and journalists blamed him for failing to take control and enforce a solution, given the position of power in which he had placed himself.

On 25 November 2005 CVC Capital Partners announced it was to purchase both the Ecclestone shares of the Formula One Group (25% of SLEC) and Bayerische Landesbank&#x27;s 48% share (held through Speed Investments). This left Alpha Prema owning 71.65% of the Formula One Group. Ecclestone used the proceeds of this sale to purchase a stake in this new company (the exact ratio of the CVC/Ecclestone shareholding is unknown). On 6 December Alpha Prema acquired JP Morgan&#x27;s share of SLEC to increase its ownership of Formula One to 86%; the remaining 14% was held by Lehman Brothers.

On 21 March 2006 the EU competition authorities approved the transaction subject to CVC selling Dorna, which controls the rights to MotoGP. CVC announced the completion of the transaction on 28 March. CVC acquired Lehman Brothers&#x27; share at the end of March 2006. Allsport Management SA, owned by Paddy McNally was also acquired by CVC on 30 March. On 21 July 2007, Ecclestone announced in the media that he would be open to discussing the purchase of Arsenal Football Club. As a close friend to former director of Arsenal David Dein, it was believed that the current board of the north London–based football club would prefer to sell to a British party, this after American-based investment company KSE headed by Stan Kroenke was thought to be preparing a £650 million takeover bid for Arsenal Holdings plc.

The revenue sharing with the various teams, the Concorde Agreement, expired on the last day of 2007, and the contract with the FIA expired on the last day of 2012.

After the loss of Silverstone as the venue for the British Grand Prix in 2008, Ecclestone came under fire from several high-profile names for his handling of Formula One&#x27;s revenues. Damon Hill blamed Formula One Management as a key factor in the loss of the event: &quot;There&#x27;s always been the question of the FOM fee, and ultimately that is the deciding factor. To quote Bernie, he once said: &#x27;You can have anything you like, as long as you pay too much for it,&#x27; but we can&#x27;t pay too much for something ... The problem is money goes out and away. There&#x27;s a question whether that money even returns to Formula One.&quot; Flavio Briatore also criticised FOM: &quot;Nowadays Ecclestone takes 50% of all revenues, but we are supposed to be able to reduce our costs by 50%&quot;.

Ecclestone was removed from his position as chief executive of Formula One Group on 23 January 2017, following its takeover by Liberty Media in 2016. He was appointed the honorary role of chairman &quot;emeritus&quot; and adviser to the board of directors, until his term expired in January 2020.

=== Other activities ===
In 1996, Ecclestone&#x27;s International Sportsworld Communicators signed a 14-year agreement with the FIA for the exclusive broadcasting rights for 18 FIA championships. In 1999, the European Commission investigated FIA, ISC and FOA for abusing dominant position and restricting competition. As a result, in early 2000 the ISC and FIA made a new agreement to reduce the number of rights packages to two, the World Rally and Regional Rally Championships. In April 2000 Ecclestone sold ISC to a group led by David Richards.

On 17 June 2005, Ecclestone made American headlines with his reply to a question about Danica Patrick&#x27;s fourth-place finish at the Indianapolis 500, during an interview with Indianapolis television station WRTV: &quot;She did a good job, didn&#x27;t she? Super. Didn&#x27;t think she&#x27;d be able to make it like that. You know, I&#x27;ve got one of these wonderful ideas that women should be all dressed in white like all the other domestic appliances.&quot; Following Patrick&#x27;s 2008 victory at Twin Ring Motegi, Ecclestone personally sent her a congratulatory letter.

On 7 January 2010, it was announced that Ecclestone had, together with Genii Capital, submitted a bid for Swedish car brand Saab Automobile.

==Queens Park Rangers==
On 3 September 2007, it was announced that Ecclestone and Flavio Briatore had bought Queens Park Rangers (QPR) Football Club. In December 2007, they were joined as co-owners by businessman Lakshmi Mittal, the fifth richest person in the world, who bought 20% of the club.

On 17 December 2010 it was announced that Ecclestone had purchased the majority of shares from Flavio Briatore becoming the majority shareholder with 62% of the shares.
It was announced on 18 August 2011 that Ecclestone and Briatore had sold their entire shareholding in the club to Tony Fernandes, known for his ownership of the Caterham Formula 1 team.

==Controversies==
===Great Train Robbery===
For many years Ecclestone was rumoured to have been involved in the Great Train Robbery (1963). In a 2014 interview Ecclestone claimed that this rumour arose from his acquaintance with robber Roy James, the getaway driver who was an amateur racing driver. James later produced the silver trophy given to Formula One promoters.

===Labour Party controversy===
In 1997, Ecclestone was involved in a political controversy over the British Labour Party&#x27;s policy on tobacco sponsorship. Labour had pledged to ban tobacco advertising in its manifesto ahead of its 1997 general election victory, supporting a proposed European Union Directive banning tobacco advertising and sponsorship. At this time all leading Formula One Teams carried significant branding from tobacco brands. The Labour Party&#x27;s stance on banning tobacco advertising was reinforced following the general election by forceful statements from the Health Secretary Frank Dobson and Minister for Public Health Tessa Jowell. Ecclestone appealed &#x27;over Jowell&#x27;s head&#x27; to Jonathan Powell, Tony Blair&#x27;s chief of staff, who arranged a meeting with Blair. Ecclestone and Max Mosley, both Labour Party donors, met Blair on 16 October 1997, where Mosley argued:
&quot;Motor racing was a world class industry which put Britain at the hi-tech edge. Deprived of tobacco money, Formula One would move abroad at the loss of 50,000 jobs, 150,000 part-time jobs and £900 million of exports.&quot; 
On 4 November the &quot;fiercely anti-tobacco Jowell&quot; argued in Brussels for an exemption for Formula One. Media attention initially focused on Labour bending its principles for a &quot;glamour sport&quot; and on the &quot;false trail&quot; of Jowell&#x27;s husband&#x27;s links to Benetton. On 6 November correspondents from three newspapers inquired whether Labour had received any donations from Ecclestone; he had donated £1 million in January 1997. On 11 November Labour promised to return the money on the advice of Sir Patrick Neill. On 17 November, Blair apologised for his government&#x27;s mishandling of the affair and stated &quot;the decision to exempt Formula One from tobacco sponsorship was taken two weeks later. It was in response to fears that Britain might lose the industry overseas to Asian countries who were bidding for it.&quot; In 2008, the year after Blair stepped down as Prime Minister, internal Downing Street memos revealed that the decision had been made at the time of the meeting, and not two weeks later as Blair stated in Parliament.

=== Tax avoidance (2008) ===
Interviews conducted by a German prosecutor in the Gerhard Gribkowsky case showed that Ecclestone had been under investigation by the UK tax authorities for nine years, and that he had avoided the payment of £1.2 billion through a legal tax avoidance scheme. HM Revenue and Customs agreed to conclude the matter in 2008 with a payment of £10 million.

=== Hitler remarks ===
In a &quot;Times&quot; interview published on 4 July 2009, Ecclestone said &quot;terrible to say this I suppose, but apart from the fact that Hitler got taken away and persuaded to do things that I have no idea whether he wanted to do or not, he was – in the way that he could command a lot of people – able to get things done.&quot; According to Ecclestone: &quot;If you have a look at a democracy it hasn&#x27;t done a lot of good for many countries — including this one&quot;, in reference to the United Kingdom. He also said that his friend of 40 years Max Mosley, the son of British fascist leader Oswald Mosley, &quot;would do a super job&quot; as Prime Minister and added &quot;I don&#x27;t think his background would be a problem.&quot;

Stephen Pollard, editor of &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot;, said: &quot;Mr Ecclestone is either an idiot or morally repulsive. Either he has no idea how stupid and offensive his views are or he does and deserves to be held in contempt by all decent people.&quot; In a subsequent interview with &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot;, Ecclestone said that his comments were taken the wrong way, but apologised, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m just sorry that I was an idiot. I sincerely, genuinely apologise.&quot; However, when Ecclestone was later told by Associated Press that the World Jewish Congress had called for his resignation, he said: &quot;It&#x27;s a pity they didn&#x27;t sort the banks out,&quot; referring to the 2007–2008 financial crisis, and stated: &quot;They have a lot of influence everywhere.&quot;

=== Bribery accusation ===
In a 2012 trial against the former BayernLB chief risk officer Gerhard Gribkowsky, the public prosecutor accused Ecclestone of being a co-perpetrator in the case. Gribkowsky confessed to the charges of tax evasion, breach of trust and for accepting bribes. In closing arguments at a Munich trial the public prosecutor told the court Ecclestone &quot;hasn&#x27;t been blackmailed, he is a co-perpetrator in a bribery case&quot;. According to the prosecutor and defendant, Ecclestone paid about $44 million to the former banker to get rid of the lender&#x27;s stake in Formula One. Ecclestone told prosecutors he paid Gribkowsky because he blackmailed him with telling UK tax authorities about a family trust controlled by Ecclestone&#x27;s former wife.
In November 2012 private equity firm Bluewaters Communications Holdings filed a £409m lawsuit against the 2005 sale of Formula One, alleging it was the sport&#x27;s rightful owner.

In May 2013, &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot; reported that the Munich prosecutors&#x27; office had charged Ecclestone on two counts of bribery after a two-year investigation into his relationship with Gribkowsky. In July 2013, German prosecutors indicted Ecclestone for alleged bribery. The charge relates to a $44 million (£29m) payment to Gribkowsky. It was linked to the sale of a stake in Formula 1. Gribkowsky, the BayernLB bank executive, was found guilty of taking $44m in bribes and failing to pay tax on the money.

On 14 January 2014, a court in Munich ruled that Ecclestone would indeed be tried on bribery charges in Germany, and on 5 August 2014, the same court ruled that Ecclestone could pay a £60m settlement, without admitting guilt, to end the trial.

=== Comments on diversity and racism ===
In the weeks following the events of the murder of George Floyd, seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton, F1&#x27;s only black driver, had launched his own commission to tackle racism and increase diversity, with Formula One launching a &quot;We Race As One&quot; initiative to fight global inequality. In an interview with CNN, Ecclestone initially praised Hamilton&#x27;s efforts but then questioned whether it would &quot;do anything bad or good for Formula One&quot;, before saying that &quot;In a lot of cases, black people are more racist than what white people are.&quot; In response, Hamilton has countered Ecclestone, criticising him on Instagram for being &quot;ignorant and uneducated&quot;, and that he has realised why nothing much has been done to address diversity and racism. Formula One Group also issued a statement, saying that they &quot;completely disagree with Bernie Ecclestone&#x27;s comments that have no place in Formula 1 or society&quot;, and had added that his title as a chairman &quot;emeritus&quot; had since expired in January 2020.

=== Illegal possession of a firearm ===
Ecclestone was arrested by Brazilian authorities on 25 May 2022 for illegally carrying a firearm while boarding a private plane to Switzerland. An undocumented LW Seecamp .32 gun was found in his luggage during an x-ray screening. Ecclestone acknowledged owning the gun, but said he was unaware it was in his luggage at the time. He subsequently paid bail and was freed to travel to Switzerland.

=== Comments on the Russian invasion of Ukraine ===

On 30 June 2022 Ecclestone appeared on an interview on ITV&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot;. Co-host Kate Garraway asked if Ecclestone was &quot;still a friend&quot; of Vladimir Putin, to which he replied that he would &quot;take a bullet&quot; for him because he was a &quot;first class person.&quot; Ecclestone argued that the Russian invasion of Ukraine was just a &quot;mistake&quot; that all business men make. Ecclestone then went on to mention that he believed President Zelenskyy could have prevented the invasion of Ukraine. GMB&#x27;s other co-host Ben Shephard asked about the death of innocent Ukrainian citizens, to which Ecclestone said it was not &quot;intentional&quot; and gave examples of American invasions into other countries.

In the same interview, Ecclestone argued against the ban on Russian drivers taking part in Formula One. He suggested that he would not have removed the Russian Grand Prix or banned Russian drivers had he been a part of the decision-making process. In response, Formula One released a statement that said: &quot;The comments made by Bernie Ecclestone are his personal views and are in very stark contrast to position of the modern values of the sport.&quot;

===Tax fraud===
On 11 July 2022 Ecclestone was officially charged with tax fraud (&quot;fraud by false representation&quot;) by the Crown Prosecution Service after an examination of a file sent to the CPS by HM Revenue and Customs which reported he had failed to declare foreign assets of £400 million.

The first hearing into the case was scheduled for 22 August at Westminster Magistrates&#x27; Court. In January 2023 the trial date was pushed back to November 2023 at an administrative hearing at Southwark Crown Court.

On 12 October 2023 at Southwark Crown Court Ecclestone pleaded guilty to fraud, after agreeing to pay nearly £653m in back tax and fines. He was sentenced to 17 months in prison, suspended for two years.

==Tom Bower biography==
In 2011, Faber and Faber published Tom Bower&#x27;s biography &quot;No Angel: The Secret Life of Bernie Ecclestone&quot;, which was written with Ecclestone&#x27;s co-operation. Bower&#x27;s previous exposé biographies of figures such as Robert Maxwell led commentators such as Bryan Appleyard, writing for the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, to express surprise over Ecclestone&#x27;s co-operation.

The book recounts an episode at the 1979 Argentine Grand Prix in which Colin Chapman offered Mario Andretti $1000 to push Ecclestone into a hotel swimming pool in Buenos Aires. A nervous Andretti approached Ecclestone and confessed the plot, to which Ecclestone replied: &quot;Pay me half and you can&quot;.

==Personal life==
As of February 2024, &quot;Forbes&quot; World&#x27;s Billionaires List estimated Ecclestone&#x27;s net worth at $2.9 billion. In 2002, he was listed as the fifth-richest person in the United Kingdom on the Sunday Times Rich List. In early 2004, he sold one of his London residences in Kensington Palace Gardens, never having lived in it, to Indian steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal for £57.1 million. At Grand Prix venues, Ecclestone used a grey mobile home, known as &quot;Bernie&#x27;s bus&quot;, as his headquarters. In 2005, Ecclestone sold his £9 million yacht &quot;Va Bene&quot; to his friend Eric Clapton. Terry Lovell published a biography of Ecclestone, &quot;Bernie&#x27;s Game: Inside the Formula One World of Bernie Ecclestone&quot; in March 2003 after legal issues had delayed its publication from its original date of November 2001&quot;.&quot; Ecclestone turned down a CBE in 1996, and later turned down a knighthood in the early 2000s as he did not believe that he deserved it. In a 2019 interview, he stated that if he had brought some good to the country, he was glad, but he did not set out with this purpose in mind, so did not deserve recognition.

Ecclestone has been married three times. With first wife Ivy, he has a daughter, Deborah, through whom he is a great-grandfather. He has five grandchildren — two granddaughters and three grandsons. Ecclestone had a 17-year relationship with Tuana Tan, which ended in 1984 when Slavica Radić, later his second wife, became pregnant. Ecclestone was then married to Yugoslav-born former Armani model Radić for 23 years. The couple have two daughters, Tamara (born 1984) and Petra (born 1988). In 2008, Slavica Ecclestone filed for divorce. Slavica settled their divorce amicably with her receiving a reported $1 billion to $1.5 billion settlement. The divorce was granted on 11 March 2009. In August 2012 Ecclestone married Fabiana Flosi, the vice-president of marketing for the Brazilian Grand Prix. Flosi is 46 years younger than Ecclestone. Ecclestone&#x27;s son with Flosi was born in July 2020. He is one of the oldest known fathers.

<text>Twila Paris (born December 28, 1958) is a contemporary Christian music singer, songwriter, author and pianist. Since 1980, Paris has released 22 albums, amassed 33 number one Christian Radio singles, and was named the Gospel Music Association Female Vocalist of the Year three years in a row. Many of her earlier songs such as &quot;He Is Exalted&quot;, &quot;We Will Glorify&quot;, &quot;Lamb of God&quot;, and &quot;We Bow Down&quot;, are found in church hymnals or otherwise sung in church settings. She was inducted into the Gospel Music Association Hall of Fame in May 2015.

==Career==
As a child she released her first album, &quot;Little Twila Paris&quot;, in 1965. The album included songs drawn from among those she sang with her family in their evangelistic outreaches.

Paris released her first full-length album, &quot;Knowin&#x27; You&#x27;re Around&quot;, in 1980, and along the way she has written books, recorded children&#x27;s music, and created worship songs.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Paris released mainly contemporary Christian pop songs. But in recent years, she has focused on recording new versions of some of her worship standards and writing new praise and worship music. Her 2005 album &quot;He Is Exalted: Live Worship&quot; collects a number of favorite songs commonly used in praise and worship of Paris&#x27;s and presents them in a more typical style of live worship music. After her song &quot;He Is Exalted&quot; was used in churches in Brazil, Paris re-recorded it in the Portuguese translation they were using. This version appears on her 1992 album &quot;Sanctuary&quot;. &quot;Sanctuary&quot; won the GMA Praise &amp; Worship Album of the Year, and in 1995, her song &quot;God Is In Control&quot; won a GMA Song of the Year award. She has won five GMA Dove Awards and three American Songwriter Awards.

Although associated for much of her career with Star Song Communications, EMI switched her to Sparrow Records in 1996, before her contract ended after 2003. In 2005, she switched to the praise and worship label Integrity Music for &quot;He Is Exalted: Live Worship&quot;.

Paris released &quot;Small Sacrifice&quot; on December 26, 2007, which was available only through her Web site and at LifeWay Christian Stores. This album married the two parts of her career by including both inspirational pop/adult contemporary songs and original praise and worship compositions. Her first radio single from &quot;Small Sacrifice&quot; was &quot;Live to Praise&quot;. &quot;Small Sacrifice&quot; was released for wider distribution by Koch Records on February 24, 2009.

In 2012, Paris released a patriotic-themed project called &quot;God Shed His Grace: Songs of Truth and Freedom&quot; that includes two new cuts (&quot;God of Our Fathers&quot; and &quot;America the Beautiful&quot;) and ten cuts that Paris hand-picked from other projects. The purpose of the project is to inspire patriots with themes of God&#x27;s protection and love, even in difficult times.

From 2011 to 2012, Paris was part of the Christian Classics Tour, joining artists Steve Green, Wayne Watson, Larnelle Harris and Michael Card.

==Legacy==
Paris has created a body of work in a modern hymn style. Her compositions are included in hymnals used by several Christian denominations and various Charismatic churches. Kelly Willard and Jamie Owens-Collins sang background vocals for her on her &quot;Keepin&#x27; My Eyes On You&quot; album and sang as a trio on the hymn &quot;Leaning on the Everlasting Arms&quot; on &quot;The Warrior Is a Child&quot;.

==Personal life==
Twila Paris is the daughter of Oren Paris II, the son of travelling late 19th and early 20th century street preachers and his wife Rachel Inez Paris. In the late 1970s, Oren Paris II founded a Youth with a Mission (YWAM) base in Elm Springs, Arkansas. Oren II is the cousin of YWAM founder, Loren Cunningham.

After Oren II&#x27;s passing, his son Oren III, claimed his father as the founder and Chancellor of Ecclesia College in Springdale, Arkansas, which operates on the former physical grounds of the Elm Springs YWAM base. In 2017, Twila Paris defended her brother Oren III after he was indicted for participating in a kickback scheme as Ecclesia&#x27;s president, stating, &quot;Those who know him [Oren III] well know that he is a man of deep integrity with a long established record of exemplary character. It is very clear that his highest aim is always to please God.&quot; In September 2018, Oren III received a three-year prison sentence for the kickback scheme after pleading guilty.

Twila Paris married her manager Jack Wright in 1985. Paris indicated in an interview that Wright had contracted the Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) causing him chronic fatigue; however in 2000, doctors discovered he had a form of hepatitis for which he was treated.

Paris and Wright have a son. His name is Jack Paris Wright.

==Politics==
Paris endorsed Ted Cruz in the 2016 Republican presidential primary, saying that &quot;he is a leader we have been praying for.&quot;

<doc id="411354" wikidata="Q378483" url="?curid=411354" title="Taejo of Joseon">
<text>Taejo (; 4 November 1335 – 27 June 1408), personal name Yi Sŏng-gye (), later Yi Tan (), was the founder and first monarch of the Joseon dynasty of Korea. After overthrowing the Goryeo dynasty, he ascended to the throne in 1392 and abdicated six years later during a strife between his sons. He was honored as Emperor Go () following the establishment of the Korean Empire.

Taejo emphasized continuity over change. No new institutions were created, and no massive purges occurred during his reign. His new dynasty was largely dominated by the same ruling families and officials that had served the previous regime. He re-established amicable ties with Japan and improved relations with Ming China.

==Biography==
===Early life===
The future King Taejo was born in Ssangseong Prefecture on the frontiers of the Yuan dynasty. Taejo&#x27;s father was Yi Cha-ch&#x27;un, an official of Korean ethnicity serving the Mongol-led Yuan. His mother, Lady Ch&#x27;oe, came from a family originally from Deungju (present-day Anbyŏn County, North Korea). In 1356, the Yi family defected to Goryeo, helping Goryeo seize control of Ssangseong Prefecture from its governor, Cho So-saeng.

===Historical context===
By the late 14th century, the 400-year-old Goryeo dynasty established by Wang Kŏn in 918 was tottering, its foundations collapsing from years of war and &quot;de facto&quot; occupation by the disintegrating Mongol Empire. The legitimacy of the royal family itself was also becoming an increasingly disputed issue within the court. The ruling house not only failed to govern the kingdom effectively but was also affected by rivalry among its various branches and by generations of forced intermarriage with members of the Yuan imperial family. King U&#x27;s biological mother being a known slave led to rumors contesting his descent from King Gongmin.

Influential aristocrats, generals, and ministers struggled for royal favor and vied for domination of the court, resulting in deep divisions between various factions. With the ever-increasing number of raids against Goryeo conducted by Japanese pirates and the Red Turbans, those who came to dominate the royal court were the reform-minded Sinjin faction of the scholar-officials and the opposing Gwonmun faction of the old aristocratic families as well as generals who could actually fight off the foreign threats—namely Yi Sŏng-gye and his rival Ch&#x27;oe Yŏng. As the Ming dynasty started to emerge, the Yuan forces became more vulnerable, and Goryeo regained its full independence by the mid-1350s although Yuan remnants effectively occupied northeastern territories with large garrisons of troops.

===Military career===
Yi Sŏng-gye started his career as a military officer in 1360 and would eventually rise up the ranks. In October 1361, he killed Pak Ŭi who rebelled against the government. In the same year when the Red Turbans had invaded and seized Gaegyeong (present-day Kaesŏng), he helped recapture the capital city with 3,000 men. In 1362, General Naghachu invaded Goryeo and Yi Sŏng-gye defeated him after being appointed as commander.

General Yi had gained prestige during the late 1370s and early 1380s by pushing Mongol remnants off the peninsula and also by repelling the well-organized Japanese pirates in a series of successful engagements. In the wake of the rise of the Ming dynasty under Zhu Yuanzhang (the Hongwu Emperor), the royal court in Goryeo split into two competing factions: the camp led by General Yi (supporting the Ming) and the one led by General Choe (supporting the Yuan).

When a Ming messenger came to Goryeo in 1388 to demand the return of a significant portion of Goryeo&#x27;s northern territory, Ch&#x27;oe Yŏng seized the opportunity and played upon the prevailing anti-Ming atmosphere to argue for the invasion of the Liaodong Peninsula. Goryeo claimed to be the successor of the ancient Korean kingdom of Goguryeo; as such, reclaiming Manchuria as part of Korean territory was a tenet of its foreign policy throughout its history.

A staunchly opposed Yi Sŏng-gye was chosen to lead the invasion; however, at Wihwa Island on the Amnok River, he made a momentous decision known as the Wihwado Retreat () which would alter the course of Korean history. Aware of the support he enjoyed from both high-ranking officials and the general populace, he decided to revolt and return to Gaegyeong to secure control of the government.

===Revolt===
General Yi led his army from the Amnok River straight into the capital, defeated forces loyal to the royal family (led by General Ch&#x27;oe whom he proceeded to eliminate), and forcibly dethroned King U in a &quot;de facto&quot; coup d&#x27;état but did not ascend to the throne himself. Instead, he placed on the throne King U&#x27;s eight-year-old son, Wang Ch&#x27;ang, and following a failed attempt to restore the former king to the throne, had both U and his son put to death. Yi Sŏng-gye, now the undisputed power behind the throne, soon forcibly had a distant royal relative named Wang Yo (posthumously King Gongyang) crowned as the new ruler, even among opposition from Goryeo loyalists. After indirectly enforcing his grasp on the royal court through the puppet king, he proceeded to ally himself with Sinjin scholar-officials such as Chŏng To-jŏn and Cho Chun.

One of the most widely known events that occurred during this period was in 1392 when one of Yi Sŏng-gye&#x27;s sons, Yi Pang-wŏn, organized a banquet for the renowned scholar and statesman Chŏng Mong-ju who refused to be won over by General Yi despite their assorted correspondence in the form of archaic poems and continued to be a faithful advocate for the old regime. Chŏng Mong-ju was revered throughout Goryeo, even by Yi Pang-wŏn himself, but in the eyes of the supporters of the new dynasty, he was seen as an obstacle which had to be removed. After the banquet, he was killed by five men on the Seonjuk Bridge.

===Reign===
In 1392, Yi Sŏng-gye forced King Gongyang to abdicate, exiled him to Wonju (where he and his family were secretly executed), and enthroned himself as the new king, thus ending Goryeo&#x27;s 475 years of rule. In 1393, he changed his dynasty&#x27;s name to Joseon.

Among his early achievements was the improvement of relations with the Ming; this had its origin in Taejo&#x27;s refusal to attack their neighbor. Shortly after his accession, he sent envoys to inform the court at Nanjing that a dynastic change had taken place. Envoys were also dispatched to Japan, seeking the re-establishment of amicable connections. The mission was successful, and Ashikaga Yoshimitsu was reported to have been favorably impressed by this embassy. Envoys from the Ryūkyū Kingdom were received in 1392, 1394 and 1397, as well as from Siam in 1393.

In 1394, the new capital was established at Hanseong (present-day Seoul).

When the new dynasty was officially promulgated, the issue of which son would be the heir to the throne was brought up. Although Yi Pang-wŏn, Taejo&#x27;s fifth son by his first wife Queen Sinui, had contributed the most to his father&#x27;s rise to power, he harbored a profound hatred against two of Taejo&#x27;s key allies, Chŏng To-jŏn and Nam Ŭn.

Both sides were fully aware of the mutual animosity and felt constantly threatened. When it became clear that Yi Pang-wŏn was the most worthy successor, Chŏng To-jŏn used his influence to convince the king that the wisest choice would be the son that he loved most, not the son that he felt was best for the kingdom.

In 1392, the eighth son of King Taejo and his second son by Queen Sindeok, Yi Pang-sŏk, was appointed as crown prince. After the sudden death of the queen in 1396 and while Taejo was still in mourning for his wife, Chŏng To-jŏn began conspiring to preemptively kill Yi Pang-wŏn and his brothers to secure his position in the royal court.

Upon hearing of this plan in 1398, Yi Pang-wŏn immediately revolted and raided the palace, killing Chŏng To-jŏn, his followers, and the two sons of the late Queen Sindeok. This incident became known as the First Strife of Princes (). Aghast at the fact that his sons were willing to kill each other for the throne and psychologically exhausted by the death of his second wife, Taejo immediately named his second son, Yi Pang-gwa (posthumously King Jeongjong), as the new successor and abdicated.

Thereafter, Taejo retired to the Hamhung Royal Villa and maintained distance with his fifth son for the rest of his life. Allegedly, Yi Pang-wŏn sent emissaries numerous times and each time the former king executed them to express his firm decision not to meet his son again. This historical anecdote gave birth to the term &quot;Hamhung Chasa&quot; () which means a person who never comes back despite several nudges. However, recent studies have found that Taejo did not actually execute any of the emissaries; these people died during revolts which coincidentally occurred in the region.

In 1400, King Jeongjong named Yi Pang-wŏn as heir presumptive and voluntarily abdicated. That same year, Yi Pang-wŏn assumed the throne of Joseon; he is posthumously known as King Taejong.

===Death===

King Taejo died ten years after his abdication on 27 June 1408 in Changdeokgung. He was buried at Geonwolleung () in the Donggureung Cluster (present-day Guri, South Korea). The tomb of his umbilical cord is located in Geumsan County, South Korea.

==Legacy==
Although Taejo overthrew Goryeo and expelled officials who remained loyal to the previous dynasty, many regard him as a revolutionary and a decisive ruler who eliminated an inept, obsolete and crippled governing system to save the nation from foreign forces and conflicts.

The resulting safeguarding of domestic security led the Koreans to rebuild and further discover their culture. In the midst of the rival Yuan and Ming dynasties, Joseon encouraged the development of national identity which was once threatened by the Mongols. However, some scholars, particularly in North Korea, view Taejo as a mere traitor to the old regime and bourgeois apostate while paralleling him to General Ch&#x27;oe Yŏng, a military elite who conservatively served Goryeo to death.

His diplomatic successes in securing Korea in the early modern period are notable.

==Ancestry==
One of the many issues demonstrating the early strained relationship between Joseon and Ming was the debate of Taejo&#x27;s genealogy which began as early as 1394 and became a source of diplomatic friction that lasted over 200 years. The Collected Regulations of the Great Ming erroneously recorded &#x27;Yi Tan&#x27; (Taejo&#x27;s personal name) as the son of Yi In-im and that Yi Tan killed the last four kings of Goryeo. This established Ming&#x27;s opinion of Taejo as an usurper first and foremost from the time of the Hongwu Emperor when he repeatedly refused to acknowledge Taejo as the new sovereign of the Korean Peninsula. The first mention of this error was in 1518 (about 9 years after the publication). Those who saw the publication petitioned the Ming for redress including, among others, left &quot;chanseong&quot; Yi Kye-maeng and minister of rites Nam Gon, who wrote &quot;Jonggye Byeonmu&quot; (). It took until 1584 (after many Ming envoys had seen the petitions) through chief scholar Hwang Chŏng-uk that the issue was finally addressed. The Wanli Emperor commissioned a second edition in 1576 (covering the years between 1479 and 1584). About a year after its completion, Yu Hong saw the revision and returned to Joseon with the good news.

<doc id="411356" wikidata="Q783597" url="?curid=411356" title="American Airlines Flight 1420">
<text>American Airlines Flight 1420 was a flight from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) to Little Rock National Airport in the United States. On June 1, 1999, the McDonnell Douglas MD-82 operating as Flight 1420 overran the runway upon landing in Little Rock and crashed. Nine of the 145 people aboard were immediately killed—the captain and eight passengers. Two more passengers died in the hospital in the following weeks.

==Aircraft==

The aircraft involved in the incident was a McDonnell Douglas MD-82 (registration ), a derivative of the McDonnell Douglas DC-9, and part of the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 series of aircraft. It was delivered new to American Airlines in 1983, and had been operated continuously by the airline since, accumulating a total of 49,136 flight hours. The aircraft was powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D-217C turbofan jet engines.

The aircraft was equipped with X-band weather radar, which is susceptible to attenuation during heavy precipitation, and did not have an attenuation alert to warn the flight crew of system impairment during heavy rainfall. The radar weather system had a forward-looking design that offered the flight crew only a limited field of view in front of the aircraft.

==Flight crew==
Flight 1420 was commanded by Captain Richard Buschmann, age 48, an experienced pilot with 10,234 flight hours, nearly half of which were accumulated flying the MD-80 series of aircraft. Buschmann graduated from the United States Air Force Academy in 1972, and served in the Air Force until 1979. He held the rank of lieutenant colonel with the US Air Force Reserve Command, and was hired by American Airlines in July 1979. Experienced at flying the Boeing 727 for American, he transitioned to flying the twin-engine MD-80 series in 1991.

The flight&#x27;s first officer was Michael Origel, age 35. The first officer had been with the airline for less than a year, and had only 182 hours of flight time with American Airlines as an MD-80 pilot. However, the first officer had trained as a pilot with the United States Navy, and had prior commercial flight experience as a corporate pilot, with a total of 4,292 hours of experience at the time of the incident.

Flight 1420 was staffed with four flight attendants, all of whom were qualified on the MD-80, and had recently received refresher training on emergency procedures.

==Flight and weather conditions==

Flight 1420 was scheduled to depart DFW at 20:28 (8:28 pm) Central Daylight Time, and arrive in Little Rock at 21:41 (9:41 pm). The flight crew was advised before boarding that the departure would be delayed, and that the National Weather Service had issued in-flight weather advisories indicating severe thunderstorms along the planned flight path. Adverse weather caused the plane that was intended for Flight 1420 to be delayed in arriving at DFW. Airline policy set a maximum pilot duty time of 14 hours, and Flight 1420 was the flight crew&#x27;s last flight of the day. The first officer notified the airline&#x27;s flight dispatcher that the flight crew would, therefore, be unable to depart after 23:16 (11:16 pm). The airline substituted another MD-80, tail number N215AA, which allowed Flight 1420 to depart DFW at 22:40 (10:40 pm).

At 23:04 (11:04 pm), air traffic controllers issued a weather advisory indicating severe thunderstorms in an area that included the Little Rock airport, and the flight crew witnessed lightning while on approach. The flight crew discussed the weather reports, but decided to expedite the approach rather than diverting to the designated alternate airport (Nashville International Airport) or returning to DFW.

Air traffic control at Little Rock had originally told Flight 1420 to expect an approach to runway 22L. At 23:39 (11:39 pm), a controller advised the crew of a wind-shear alert and a change in wind direction. As a result, Captain Buschmann requested a change to Runway 4R, so the flight would have a headwind during landing, and Flight 1420 was cleared for a visual approach to this runway. Because the plane was already close to the airport, the controller had to direct it away to line it up for a landing on 4R. As a result, Flight 1420 faced away from the airport for several minutes, and due to the plane&#x27;s weather radar capabilities being limited to a narrow and forward-facing field of view, the flight crew could not see thunderstorms approaching the airport during their turn. As the aircraft approached, a severe thunderstorm arrived over the airport, and at 23:44 (11:44 pm), the first officer notified the controller that the crew had lost sight of the runway. The controller then cleared the aircraft to land on 4R using an instrument landing system (ILS) approach.

The pilots rushed to land as soon as possible, leading to errors in judgment that included the crew&#x27;s failure to complete the airline&#x27;s pre-landing checklist before descending. This was a crucial event in the accident chain, as the crew overlooked multiple critical landing systems on the checklist. The flight crew failed to arm the automatic spoiler system, which automatically moves the spoiler control lever, and deploys the spoilers upon landing. The pilots also failed to set the plane&#x27;s automatic braking system. The flight crew also failed to set landing flaps, another item on the before landing checklist, but as the plane descended past , the first officer realized the flaps were not set, and the flight crew set a 40° flap setting for landing.

At 23:49:32 (11:49:32 pm), the controller issued the last weather report before Flight 1420 landed, and advised that winds at the airport were 330° at . The reported winds exceeded the MD-82&#x27;s crosswind limit for landing in reduced visibility on a wet runway. Despite the excessive crosswind and two wind-shear reports, Captain Buschmann did not abandon the aircraft&#x27;s approach into Little Rock, deciding to continue the approach to 4R instead.

==Crash==

The aircraft touched down on Runway 4R at 23:50:20 (11:50:20 pm). About two seconds after the wheels touched down, First Officer Origel stated, &quot;We&#x27;re down. We&#x27;re sliding!&quot; Because the pilots failed to arm the autospoiler, the spoilers did not deploy automatically on landing, and the flight crew did not deploy them manually. Autospoilers and autobrakes are essential to ensure the plane&#x27;s ability to stop within the confines of a wet runway, especially one that is being subjected to strong and gusting winds. Spoilers disrupt the airflow over the wings, prevent them from generating lift, and cause more of the plane&#x27;s weight to be borne by the landing gear. About 65% of Flight 1420&#x27;s weight would have been supported by the plane&#x27;s landing gear if the spoilers had been deployed, but without the spoilers, this number dropped to only 15%. With the light loading of the landing gear, the aircraft&#x27;s brakes were ineffective at slowing down the plane, which continued down the runway at high speed. Directional control was lost when Captain Buschmann applied too much reverse thrust, which reduced the effectiveness of the plane&#x27;s rudder and vertical stabilizer.

The aircraft continued past the end of the runway, traveling another , and striking a security fence and an ILS localizer array. The aircraft then collided with a structure built to support the approach lights for Runway 22L, which extended out into the Arkansas River. Such structures are usually , designed to shear off on impact, but because the approach lights were located on the unstable river bank, they were firmly anchored. The collision with the sturdy structure crushed the airplane&#x27;s nose, and destroyed the left side of the plane&#x27;s fuselage, from the cockpit back to the first two rows of coach seating. The impact broke the aircraft apart into large sections, which came to a rest short of the river bank.

Captain Buschmann and 8 of the plane&#x27;s 139 passengers were immediately killed in the crash; another two passengers died in the hospital in the weeks that followed. First Officer Origel, three of the four flight attendants, and 41 passengers sustained serious injuries, the remaining flight attendant and 64 passengers sustained minor injuries, and 24 passengers sustained no injuries.

==Investigation==
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigated the crash.

===Automatic spoiler and brake systems===
The NTSB conducted extensive testing to determine whether the automatic spoiler and brake systems had been armed by the pilots before landing.

The plane&#x27;s cockpit voice recorder (CVR) was reviewed, and no sounds consistent with the spoiler arming or automatically deploying were recorded by the CVR. The NTSB conducted two test flights of American Airlines MD-80 aircraft, which confirmed that manually arming the spoiler created an audible &quot;click&quot; noise—distinguishable from noises made by automatic deployment of the system—that could be clearly heard on CVR playback. The NTSB also conducted ground tests on similar aircraft, including another American Airlines MD-80, for which the autospoiler system failed to deploy during a runway overrun event in Palm Springs, California, but did not result in destruction of the aircraft.

After Flight 1420 and the Palm Springs incident, American Airlines revised its checklist so pilots would confirm that the spoilers are armed for autodeployment before landing, confirm spoiler deployment, and deploy spoilers manually if they had failed to automatically deploy.

===Pilot behavior regarding thunderstorms===
The NTSB investigation also focused on pilot behavior in inclement weather, to determine the impact the storms may have had on the pilots&#x27; decision-making process while approaching Little Rock National Airport.

Experts from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology performed a study that recorded the behavior of pilots landing at Dallas/Fort Worth Airport, which aimed to see whether pilots were willing to land in thunderstorms. From a total of 1,952 thunderstorm encounters, 1,310 pilots (67%) flew into thunderstorms during landing attempts. The study found that pilots exhibited more recklessness if they fell behind schedule, if they were attempting to land at night, and if aircraft in front of them successfully landed in similar weather. In a later interview, Greg Feith, the lead NTSB investigator, said he was surprised to learn that pilots exhibited this behavior. Feith added that the pilots may have exhibited &quot;get there-itis&quot;, more formally known as &quot;task completion bias&quot; (TCB), as the pilots knew that they were approaching their 14-hour duty limits.

===Fatigue===
The NTSB report cited fatigue as a contributing factor. The captain had been awake for 16 hours that day; research indicates that after being awake for 13 hours, pilots make considerably more mistakes. The time of the crash occurred several hours after both pilots&#x27; usual bedtime. The first officer reported feeling tired that night, and a yawn was heard on the CVR. The report stated that sleep-deprived individuals are likely to try the same method of problem solving repeatedly without regard to alternatives.

===Cause===
On October 23, 2001, the NTSB issued its determination on the cause of the crash:

==Legal issues==
Multiple lawsuits were filed after the crash, and on December 15, 1999, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated the various federal lawsuits for consolidated and coordinated pretrial proceedings, and assigned the case to United States District Court Senior Judge Henry Woods of the Eastern District of Arkansas. In the lawsuits, the passengers sought compensatory and punitive damages from American Airlines.

Judge Woods separated the passenger cases into those involving domestic and international passengers, because different laws governed the rights of the claimants in each category. For example, passengers traveling on international tickets were prohibited by an international treaty (the Warsaw Convention) from recovering punitive damages. Therefore, Judge Woods ruled that only the domestic passengers would be permitted to pursue punitive damages claims.

The compensatory damages claims proceeded first. American Airlines &quot;admitted liability for the crash, and individual trials were scheduled to assess the proper amount of compensatory damages. Thereafter, American Airlines reached settlement agreements with a majority of the domestic Plaintiffs.&quot;

As part of the settlement agreement, &quot;Plaintiffs relinquished not only their compensatory damages claims, but their punitive damages claims, as well.&quot; The case proceeded as &quot;three compensatory damages trials involving domestic Plaintiffs [that] were ultimately tried to a jury, and awards of $5.7 million, $3.4 million, and $4.2 million were made.&quot; These three Plaintiffs pursued, but ultimately lost their claims for punitive damages. The District Court granted summary judgment in American Airlines&#x27; favor on punitive damages, finding under Arkansas law that there was insufficient evidence to submit the issue to a jury to decide. This ruling was later upheld on appeal.

In the only liability trial arising out of the crash of Flight 1420, a federal jury in Little Rock awarded Captain Buschmann&#x27;s family $2 million in wrongful-death damages following a lawsuit they had filed against Little Rock National Airport. The jury decided Buschmann&#x27;s death occurred because the aircraft collided with illegal nonfrangible approach-light supports erected in what should have been the runway safety area. The airport was found to have failed to comply with airport safety standards. Buschmann&#x27;s estate presented evidence that the spoilers were deployed and had malfunctioned (not through the captain&#x27;s fault), and that the aircraft did not encounter turbulence. The jury rejected the airport&#x27;s argument that Buschmann was at fault in causing his own death.

The jury verdict has been claimed to completely absolve Buschmann of all fault for the crash, but the NTSB has not changed its probable-cause ruling; additionally, American Airlines admitted liability for the crash, and had &quot;paid many millions of dollars in damages to the passengers and their families.&quot; About 10 years following the crash, David E. Rapoport, an attorney who was a member of the court-appointed Plaintiffs&#x27; Steering Committee, surmised, &quot;after all these years, [whether Captain Buschmann was &quot;absolved&quot; of all responsibility for the crash] is still a matter reasonable people who are fully informed may disagree on.&quot; However, Rapoport concluded that there should be a consensus understanding among all parties involved that &quot;flight operations should not be conducted in the terminal area when thunderstorms are on the flight path, and nonfrangible objects should not be placed where it is foreseeable an aircraft may go.&quot;

==Aftermath==
A 2004 memorial ceremony was held adjacent to the airport. Survivor Jeana Varnell attended the ceremony, but was quoted in a newspaper article as saying that she strongly objected to memorializing Captain Buschmann.

American Airlines still flies to Little Rock from Dallas, but the aircraft used is mostly an Embraer E175.

Every year between 2000 and 2022, the father of crash victim Debra Taylor-Sattari elaborately decorated the exterior of his home in Vallejo, California with Christmas lights and decorations in her honor, which has gained attention from local and national media.

==In popular culture==

<text>[[USNS]] &quot;Lewis and Clark&quot; (T-AKE-1) is an American dry cargo ship, the lead ship of her namesake class. It was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark. The contract to build her was awarded to National Steel and Shipbuilding Company (NASSCO) of San Diego, California, on 18 October 2001 and her keel was laid down on 22 April 2004. She was launched on 21 May 2005, co-sponsored by Jane Lewis Sale Henley and Lisa Clark, descendants of the ship&#x27;s namesakes. She was delivered to the Navy on 20 June 2006.

==Description==
The T-AKE is a replenishment naval vessel operated by Military Sealift Command with civilian mariner crews (53 personnel) augmented by a military department (5 personnel). In 2012, &quot;Lewis and Clark&quot; became one of 14 ships that comprise the United States Marine Corps (USMC) Maritime Prepositioning Program (MPP).

Replenishment ships help allow the Marine Corps maintain a forward presence. Her primary mission is the delivery of supplies to enable the arrival and assembly of a Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB). The T-AKE transfers cargo – ammunition, food, fuel, repair parts, ship store items and expendable supplies to Marine and joint forces ashore.

The Navy awarded National Steel and Shipbuilding Company of San Diego, Calif., a $406.9 million competitive contract 18 October 2001, to build the first ship of the class, USNS &quot;Lewis and Clark&quot;. The Navy also exercised a $301.6 million option in the contract for the construction of the second ship of the class, .

The U.S. Navy had previously fielded a ballistic missile submarine named .

==Antipiracy==

In February 2009, the ship was deployed off the coast of Somalia as part of Operation Enduring Freedom - Horn of Africa. The vessel was fitted out to be used as a prison ship for captured pirates.
On 20 November 2010, the &quot;Lewis and Clark&quot; responded to a distress call by the Chinese-flagged cargo ship M/V &quot;Tai An Kou&quot; which was under attack by Somalian pirates. Upon sighting the US naval vessel, the pirates opened fire and the &quot;Lewis and Clark&quot; returned fire in a brief engagement that drove the pirates off without causing any casualties. The destroyer then also arrived on the scene 10 hours later and launched a helicopter to provide additional assistance until the PLAN frigate &quot;Xuzhou&quot; arrived.

<text>Schisandra, the magnolia vines, is a genus of twining shrubs that generally climb on other vegetation. Various authors have included the plants in the Illiciaceae

&quot;Schisandra&quot; (also spelled &quot;Schizandra&quot;) is native to Asia and North America, with a center of diversity in China.

Some species are commonly grown in gardens as ornamentals. It is a hardy deciduous climber which thrives in almost any kind of soil; its preferred position is on a sheltered, shady wall. It may be propagated by cuttings of half-matured shoots in August.

Despite its common name &quot;magnolia vine&quot;, &quot;Schisandra&quot; is not closely related to the true magnolias.

==Uses==
Its dried fruit is sometimes used medicinally. In China, the berries of &quot;S. chinensis&quot; are given the name () because they possess all five basic flavors in Chinese herbal medicine: salty, sweet, sour, pungent (spicy), and bitter. In traditional Chinese medicine it is used as a remedy for many ailments: to resist infections, increase skin health, combat insomnia, coughing, and thirst.

==Species==
;accepted species
== Chemistry ==
The extract of &quot;S. rubriflora&quot;, a native of the Yunnan province, was found to contain complex and highly oxygenated nortriterpenoids called rubriflorins A-C.

<doc id="411367" wikidata="Q6226613" url="?curid=411367" title="John Cole (journalist)">
<text>John Morrison Cole (23 November 1927 – 7 November 2013) was a Northern Irish journalist and broadcaster, best known for his work with the BBC. Cole served as deputy editor of &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Observer&quot; and, from 1981 to 1992, was the BBC&#x27;s political editor. Donald Macintyre, in an obituary in &quot;The Independent&quot;, described him as &quot;the most recognisable and respected broadcast political journalist since World War II.&quot;

==Early life==
Cole was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in 1927 to George Cole, an electrical engineer, and his wife Alice. The family were Ulster Protestants, and Cole identified himself as British. He received his formal education at the Belfast Royal Academy.

==Journalism career==
===Print journalism===
Cole started his career in print journalism in 1945, aged 17, joining the &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot; as a reporter and industrial correspondent. He subsequently worked as a political reporter for the paper. He gained a scoop when he interviewed the then Prime Minister, Clement Attlee, who was holidaying in Ireland.

He joined &quot;The Guardian&quot;, then the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;, in 1956, reporting on industrial issues. He transferred to the London office in 1957 as the paper&#x27;s labour correspondent. Appointed news editor in 1963, succeeding 
Nesta Roberts, Cole took on the task of reorganising the paper&#x27;s &quot;amateurish&quot; system for gathering news. He headed opposition to a proposed merger with &quot;The Times&quot; in the mid-1960s, and later served as deputy editor under Alastair Hetherington. When Hetherington left in 1975, Cole was in the running for the editorship, but failed to secure the post, for reasons which may have included his commitment to the cause of unionism in Northern Ireland, as well as what was seen by some as inflexibility and a lack of flair. Unwilling to continue at &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Cole then joined &quot;The Observer&quot; as deputy editor under Donald Trelford, remaining there for six years.

Peter Preston, who beat Cole to the editorship of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, describes him as &quot;a great labour correspondent&quot;, &quot;a driving news editor&quot; and &quot;a vivid presence&quot; at the newspaper. Colleague David McKie wrote that one of his strengths was &quot;to ask the awkward question that punctured glib assumptions and casual simplicities.&quot;

===Television===
After Tiny Rowland took over as proprietor of &quot;The Observer&quot; in 1981, Cole gave evidence against him at the Monopolies Commission. The following day he got a call from the BBC offering him the job of political editor, succeeding John Simpson. Cole commented on his switch from print to television journalism: &quot;The invitation to have a ringside seat for what must be the most fascinating period in modern politics was irresistible.&quot; He had little previous television experience but proved a &quot;natural broadcaster.&quot; Reporting through most of the premiership of Margaret Thatcher, he became a familiar figure on television and radio.

His health was put under strain by the workload and he suffered a heart attack in February 1984. Returning to report on that year&#x27;s conference season, he covered the Brighton hotel bombing, getting a &quot;memorable&quot; interview with Thatcher on the pavement in its immediate aftermath, in which she declared that the Tory conference would take place as normal. An astute observer of the political scene, Cole was one of the earliest to forecast Thatcher&#x27;s resignation as Prime Minister in 1990, in what McKie refers to as &quot;perhaps his greatest exclusive.&quot; Donald Macintyre writes that he &quot;did more than any single figure to create popular understanding of the turbulent 1980s&quot;.

Cole established a strong reputation for his &quot;gentle but probing&quot; interviewing style, for his political assessments, and for presenting analysis rather than &quot;bland reporting.&quot; McKie considers him to have &quot;revolutionised the routine broadcast reporting of politics&quot;, while Macintyre states that he &quot;pioneered the best in modern political broadcast journalism.&quot; &quot;Held in enormous affection by viewers,&quot; Cole was trusted by both politicians and the public. He was known for &quot;speaking in the language used by ordinary people&quot; rather than &quot;so-called Westminster experts&quot; and for &quot;articulat[ing] the viewpoint of the ordinary man or woman in the street.&quot; His distinctive Northern Irish accent – lampooned by &quot;Private Eye&quot; and &quot;Spitting Image&quot;, who made a puppet representing him – led the way for BBC broadcasters with regional accents.

He retired as political editor in 1992 (aged 65), compulsory at that date, but continued to appear on television, including making programmes on golf and travel. He also continued to appear on the BBC programme &quot;Westminster Live&quot; for several years after he retired as political editor.

===Writing===
In addition to his journalistic writing, Cole authored several books. The earliest were &quot;The Poor of the Earth&quot;, on developing countries, and &quot;The Thatcher Years&quot; (1987). After his retirement as BBC political editor, he spent more time writing. His political memoir, &quot;As It Seemed To Me&quot;, appeared in 1995 and became a best-seller. He also published a novel, &quot;A Clouded Peace&quot; (2001), set in his birthplace of Belfast in 1977.

In 2007 he wrote an article for the&quot; British Journalism Review&quot;, blaming both politicians and the media for the fact that parliamentarians were held in such low esteem, being particularly scathing of Alastair Campbell&#x27;s influence during Tony Blair&#x27;s premiership.

==Awards==
In 1966, the Eisenhower Fellowships selected Cole to represent Great Britain. He received the Royal Television Society&#x27;s Journalist of the Year award in 1991. After his retirement in 1992, he was awarded an honorary degree from the Open University as Doctor of the University, and received the Richard Dimbleby Award from BAFTA in 1993. He turned down a CBE in 1993, citing the former &quot;Guardian&quot; newspaper rule that journalists could only accept gifts which could be consumed within 24 hours.

==Personal life==
In his private life Cole was a supporter of the Labour Party, and was a believer in the trades union movement. He considered that the combating of unemployment was one of the most important political issues. He was a British Republican, and a committed Christian, associating in the latter part of his life with the United Reformed Church at Kingston upon Thames. He was described by colleague Peter Preston as &quot;warm, generous and the kind of colleague we all wished to be.&quot;

He married Madge around 1956. The couple had four sons and nine grandchildren.

==Death==
Cole suffered health problems in retirement including heart problems and two minor strokes. In 2009 he was diagnosed with cancer. He subsequently developed aphasia. Cole died at his home at Claygate in the county of Surrey on 7 November 2013.

==Tributes==
Tributes were paid by journalists, broadcasters and politicians across the political spectrum. Prime Minister David Cameron called him a &quot;titan at the BBC&quot; and an &quot;extraordinary broadcaster&quot;. Labour party leader Ed Miliband said that &quot;my generation grew up watching John Cole. He conveyed the drama and importance of politics.&quot; The Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond said that Cole was &quot;an extremely able journalist but also extraordinarily helpful and generous to a young politician.&quot; The BBC&#x27;s political editor at the time, Nick Robinson, wrote that Cole &quot;shaped the way all in my trade do our jobs&quot;.

<text>A crème liqueur is a liqueur that has a great deal of additional sugar added to the point that it has a near-syrup consistency. Unlike cream liqueurs, crème liqueurs include no cream in their ingredients. &quot;Crème&quot; in this case refers to the consistency.

<doc id="411372" wikidata="Q338182" url="?curid=411372" title="Sandman (Wesley Dodds)">
<text>The Sandman (Wesley Bernard &quot;Wes&quot; Dodds) is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The first of several DC characters to bear the name Sandman, he was created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Allen Bert Christman. Attired in a green business suit, fedora, and World War I gas mask, the Sandman used a gun emitting a sleeping gas to sedate criminals. He was originally one of the &quot;mystery men&quot; to appear in comic books and other types of adventure fiction in the 1930s, but later was outfitted with a unitard/cowl costume and developed into a proper superhero, acquiring a sidekick, Sandy, and founding the Justice Society of America (JSA).

Like most DC Golden Age superheroes, the Sandman fell into obscurity in the 1940s and eventually other DC characters took his name. During the 1990s, when writer Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;Sandman&quot; (featuring Morpheus, the anthropomorphic embodiment of dreams) was popular, DC revived Dodds in &quot;Sandman Mystery Theatre&quot;, a pulp/noir series set in the 1930s. &quot;Wizard Magazine&quot; ranked Wesley Dodds among the Top 200 Comic Book Characters of All Time, and he is the oldest superhero in terms of continuity to appear on the list.
==Publication history==

===Golden Age of comic books===
Artist Bert Christman and writer Gardner Fox are generally credited as co-creating the original, Wesley Dodds version of the DC Comics character the Sandman. While the character&#x27;s first appearance is usually given as &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #40 (cover-dated July 1939), he also appeared in DC Comics&#x27; 1939 &quot;New York World&#x27;s Fair Comics&quot; omnibus, which historians believe appeared on newsstands one to two weeks earlier, while also believing the &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; story was written and drawn first. Each of the two stories&#x27; scripts were credited to the pseudonym &quot;Larry Dean&quot;; Fox wrote the untitled, 10-page story in &quot;New York World&#x27;s Fair&quot; #1, while he simply plotted, and Christman scripted, the untitled, six-page story, generally known as &quot;The Tarantula Strikes&quot;, in &quot;Adventure&quot; #40. Creig Flessel, who drew many early Sandman adventures, has sometimes been credited as co-creator on the basis of drawing the Sandman cover of &quot;Adventure&quot; #40, but no other evidence has surfaced.

Following these two first appearances, the feature &quot;The Sandman&quot; continued to appear in the anthology &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; through #102 (February–March 1946). One of the medium&#x27;s seminal &quot;mystery men&quot;, as referred to at the time, the Sandman straddled the pulp magazine detective tradition and the emerging superhero tradition by dint of his dual identity and his fanciful, masked attire and weapon: an exotic &quot;gas gun&quot; that could compel villains to tell the truth, as well as put them to sleep. Unlike many superheroes, he frequently found himself the victim of gunshot wounds, both in the Golden Age and in stories in DC&#x27;s modern-day Vertigo imprint, and he would continue fighting in spite of his injuries.

In his early career, Dodds (the character&#x27;s surname was given as &quot;Dodd&quot; in his first four appearances; he became &quot;Dodds&quot; in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #44) was frequently aided by his girlfriend, Dian Belmont, who is aware of his dual identity. Unlike many superhero love interests, Belmont was often, though not always, portrayed as an equal partner of the Sandman, rather than a damsel in distress. Later stories would reveal that the two remained together for the duration of their lives, though they never married.

The Sandman was one of the original members of the Justice Society of America when that superhero team was introduced in &quot;All Star Comics&quot; #3, published by All-American Comics, one of the companies that would merge to form DC.

In &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #69 (December 1941), Dodds was given a yellow-and-purple costume by writer Mort Weisinger and artist Paul Norris, as well as a yellow-clad kid sidekick, Sandy the Golden Boy, nephew of Dian Belmont. Later that year, the celebrated team of Joe Simon and Jack Kirby took over this version of the character. In 1942, Dodds enlisted in the U.S. Army and served as an anti-aircraft gunner during World War II.

===Silver Age to Modern Age===

Reintroduced in the Silver Age in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #46 (July 1966), the Sandman made occasional appearances in the annual teamups between that superhero group and the JSA.

In 1981 DC began publishing &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot;, a retelling of the Earth-Two mystery-men during WWII. Although not a main character, Sandman does appear in its pages. Of note is issue #18 which gives an explanation of why Dodds changed costumes from the cloak and gas mask to the yellow-and-purple outfit; Dian wore his costume while he was fighting elsewhere and she was killed in a fray. Dodds decided to wear the new costume, of Dian&#x27;s design, until he could bring himself to wear the original in which she had died.

Later, this explanation would be changed again when Dian Belmont was retconned to have never died, and a new explanation was given: Sandy convinced Dodds to switch to the more colorful costume to gain the support of regular people, who preferred the more traditional superhero look to his older, pulp-themed costume.

An acclaimed film noir-inspired retelling of the original Sandman&#x27;s adventures, &quot;Sandman Mystery Theatre&quot;, ran from 1993 to 1998 under DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Vertigo&quot; mature-reader imprint. Although as a whole its continuity within the DC Universe is debatable, several elements of the series – the more nuanced relationship between Dodds and Dian Belmont; the Sandman&#x27;s appearance (wearing a trench coat and World War I gas mask instead of the cape and the custom-made gas mask); and Dodds&#x27; pudgier appearance and wearing of glasses – have been adopted into regular continuity. The series ran for 70 issues and 1 annual.

In &quot;Sandman Midnight Theatre&quot; (1995) a one-shot special by Neil Gaiman (author of the Modern Age supernatural series &quot;The Sandman&quot;), Matt Wagner (co-author of &quot;Sandman Mystery Theatre&quot;), and Teddy Kristiansen, depicts an interaction between the two characters, with the original visiting Great Britain and encountering the imprisoned Dream, the protagonist of Gaiman&#x27;s series. A minor retcon by Gaiman suggested that Dodds&#x27; chosen identity was a result of Dream&#x27;s absence from the realm the Dreaming, and that Dodds carries an aspect of that mystical realm. This explains Dodds&#x27; prophetic dreams.

===Twilight years===
Dodds is one of a number of Justice Society members who finds themselves in the &quot;Ragnarok Dimension&quot; during the early Modern Age of comic books. The &quot;Last Days of the Justice Society of America Special&quot; (1986) wrote the post-&quot;Crisis&quot; tale of a time-warped wave of destruction ready to engulf the world. Dodds and his JSA teammates enter into a limbo to engage in an eternal battle that would allow the universe to continue its existence. This was later revealed to be a simulation created by Odin, which he intended to give to Dream as a bribe. Dodds, Dream&#x27;s protege, and Hawkman, the grandfather of Dream&#x27;s appointed successor are the only JSA members who were seen at that time. This lasted only until 1992 when DC published &quot;Armageddon: Inferno&quot;. This mini-series ended with the JSA members leaving limbo and entering the &#x27;real&#x27; world. &quot;Justice Society of America&quot; (1992–1993) showed how the JSA members handled returning to normal life. For the Sandman, the series depicted him as an old, thin man with a balding scalp and a sharp wit. Starting with issue #1 his physical condition became important as writer Len Strazewski had him suffer a stroke at the first sign of a villainous attack. Both his age and his physical limitations became a theme writers would use in this character&#x27;s post-&quot;Crisis&quot; stories.

During &quot;Zero Hour&quot;, Dodds is returned to his proper age by Extant. Later, Wesley Dodds is shown as retired and living with Dian Belmont though occasionally coming out of it, most notably in a team-up with Jack Knight, the son of Dodds&#x27; JSA teammate Starman. When Dian is diagnosed with a terminal disease, the two travel the world together until her death.

Towards the end of his life, Dodds&#x27; prophetic dreams alert him to the identity and location of the new Doctor Fate, prompting him to contact the Gray Man, a being created from the residue of others&#x27; dreams, as well as his old friend Speed Saunders to instruct them to warn his former teammates about what he has discovered. Waiting on a clifftop, he is subsequently confronted by the powerful villain Mordru, who intends to force Dodds to tell him the identity of the new Doctor Fate, only for Dodds to distract Mordru with his gas-gun long enough to commit suicide by jumping off the cliff rather than allow Mordru to torture him into submission. Dodd&#x27;s sidekick Sandy the Golden Boy becomes known simply as Sand and takes his mentor&#x27;s place as a member of the Justice Society of America.

===Blackest Night===
Dodds has largely remained dead since. However, he is temporarily resurrected as a Black Lantern in &quot;Blackest Night&quot; and as a zombie in &quot;Knight Terrors&quot;.

===Dawn of DC===
In 2023, Dodds received a self-titled miniseries as part of &quot;The New Golden Age&quot; titled &quot;Wesley Dodds: The Sandman&quot;, which explored his adventures during the 1940s where he contended with theft from his house, a doppelganger killer named Fog, and the betrayal of his friend Wheeler Vanderlyle. After Vanderlyle is shot by Dian Belmont, Dodds oversaw the reconstruction of his mansion and met Dian&#x27;s nephew Sandy Hawkins. He would later join the Justice Society.

==Powers and abilities==
Dodds has prophetic dreams which come to him as cryptic, ambiguous visions of crimes. Originally of unexplained origin, these dreams were later ascribed to an encounter between Dodds and the entity known as Dream via retcon. The visions haunt Dodds, who uses his keen intellect and amateur detective skills to properly interpret them. He is also a talented chemist and inventor, creating the sand-like substance and the Silicoid Gun ultimately responsible for transforming Sandy the Golden Boy into a silicon-based life-form. In the early years of his career, Wesley Dodds possesses the strength level of a man who engages in regular exercise, and was a fine hand-to-hand combatant. As he grows older, his strength level diminishes in relative proportion to his age. As hobbies, Dodds enjoys reading, writing, poetry, origami and philosophy. Through an unknown process, Dodds passes his power of prophetic visions on to his former ward, Sandy Hawkins, upon the moment of his own death.

===Equipment===
Wesley Dodds&#x27; costume consists of a basic green business suit, fedora, a World War I era gas mask, a gas gun, and a specially designed &quot;wirepoon&quot; gun, which fires a length of thin, steel cable. The gas mask protects Dodds from the effects of the gas emitted from his gas gun. The gas gun, a handheld device fitted with cartridges containing concentrated sleeping gas, is Wesley Dodds&#x27; only known weapon. Pressing the trigger on the gun releases a cloud of green dust rendering all within the Sandman&#x27;s immediate vicinity unconscious. An upgraded canister dispenser for the gun is provided for him by his close friend and confidant Lee Travis. Dodds is also known to conceal smaller knockout gas capsules in a hollow heel on his shoe. These prove ideal when placed in situations where his gas gun is not readily available.

In the early days of his career, the Sandman drives a black 1938 Plymouth coupe. The car is enhanced with various features to aid Dodds in his crusade against crime.

==Enemies==

Sandman has an assortment of enemies that he fought:

* Butcher - A cannibalistic butcher.
* Doctor Death - Raymond Kessler is a serial killer/swindler who is the boyfriend of Dian Belmont&#x27;s cousin Lucy.
* Phantom of the Fair - Gerald Zimmerman is a man who has been torturing and killing homosexual men at the New York World&#x27;s Fair.
* Ramulus - A plant-manipulating villain who was also known as Nightshade and Plant Master. He later appeared as a member of the Monster Society of Evil.
* Scorpion - Terrence Pritchard is an ad executive who becomes a bullwhip-wielding vigilante.
* Tarantula - A man who targeted Vivian Dale. There was also a second Tarantula that Sandman fought. This one was Roger Goldman who is a serial killer and the former owner of the Evergood Milk Bottling Company.

==Other versions==
===&quot;Kingdom Come&quot;===
Dodds appears as an infirm old man at the beginning of &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, plagued with visions of the impending apocalyptic battle between various factions of metahumans. Before his death, he relates his visions, interpreted through passages from the Book of Revelation, to his friend Norman McCay, who later witnesses the events in the company of the Spectre. 

===Earth 40===
On Earth 40, Wesley Dodds meets with to give information about the Trigger, a device that causes every nuclear reactor in the world to detonate in a nuclear explosion. The Sandman arranges for The Unholy Three to meet with The Lantern, who has information on where the Trigger is located.

===Earth 2===
In &quot;The New 52&quot; (a reboot of DC Comics), a new Earth-2 version of Sandman appears. While he does wear a gas mask and wield a gas gun, he is also equipped with a teleporter. When Washington DC is attacked by Solomon Grundy, Commander Wesley Dodds, along with his Sandmen paramilitary force, is sent to retrieve and save President Lightfoot. They are later assigned by Commander Khan to a special and unofficial mission to infiltrate Terry Sloane&#x27;s secret facility, where they confront and subdue a mind-controlled Michael Holt.

<text>The Sandman (William Baker, a.k.a. Flint Marko) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. A shapeshifter endowed through an accident with the ability to turn himself into sand, he started out as a recurring adversary to the superhero Spider-Man, but has redeemed himself over time, eventually becoming an antihero. The Sandman has also been an enemy of the Fantastic Four and is a founding member of the supervillain teams the Sinister Six and the Frightful Four.

The character has been adapted into various other media incarnations of Spider-Man, including films, television series, and video games. In live-action, he was portrayed by Thomas Haden Church in &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; (2007) and the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; (2021). An illusionary creature based on the Sandman appeared in the MCU film &quot;Spider-Man: Far from Home&quot; (2019). In 2009, the Sandman was ranked as IGN&#x27;s 72nd Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.

==Publication history==
The Sandman first appeared in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #4 (Sept. 1963), created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko as an adversary of Spider-Man. The character returned in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man Annual&quot; #1 and &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #18-19, and was soon depicted in other comics, such as &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; and &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot;.

The Sandman served as the villain of the first issue of the Spider-Man spin-off series &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; (March 1972), which gave him a more morally ambiguous depiction. Writer Roy Thomas later commented, &quot;I&#x27;ve been pleased to see Sandman&#x27;s gradual redemption, whose seeds perhaps I helped plant in that story. He just seemed to me like a character who might have that in him ...&quot; Subsequent stories stuck with the character&#x27;s original depiction, but a decade later the more sympathetic portrayal of the Sandman returned, starting with &quot;Marvel Two-in-One&quot; #86 (April 1982), in which the Sandman is given co-star billing with his nemesis the Thing. The Sandman was later an ally of Spider-Man, as well as a reserve member of the Avengers and a member of Silver Sable&#x27;s &quot;Wild Pack&quot; team of mercenaries.

Besides being most notable as a Spider-Man supervillain, he has also been depicted as a Fantastic Four antagonist in Stan Lee and Jack Kirby comic books (mostly due to being introduced as a founding member of the original Frightful Four) along with being on the heroic side (being an Avengers reserve member) until being introduced as a tragic supervillain in the Spider-Man comics once again.

==Fictional character biography==
William Baker was born in Queens, New York. When he was three years old, his father abandoned him and his mother. In these early years, she took her son to Coney Island beach. He lost himself happily in sand sculptures, a craft he would use in secondary school under the encouragement of his teacher (and first crush), Miss Flint.

In preparatory school, a boy named Vic bullied Baker until he learned to fight using an opponent&#x27;s motions against themselves, a technique he performed as if he &quot;slipped through their fingers like sand&quot;. Vic and his buddies eventually befriended Baker. In high school, William played on his school&#x27;s football team, using the sport to channel his anger. While playing football, he adopted the nickname &quot;Flint&quot;, after his former teacher.

After Vic incurs a large gambling debt to a mobster, he begs Flint to fix a football game he bet on to pay off his debt. Flint does, but is kicked off the team after the coach discovers his involvement. The coach taunts Baker, telling him that he will accomplish nothing of importance in his life. Flint hits his ex-coach, resulting in his expulsion from school and the beginning of his life of crime.

His illegal activity increases in depth and scope, turning him into a violent, bitter man. Eventually he ends up in prison on Ryker&#x27;s Island where he meets his father, Floyd Baker. He is friendly to his father, but does not tell him who he is. He tells Floyd his nickname, Flint, and a false surname, Marko, inspired by his former coach&#x27;s taunts about not &quot;making a mark&quot; on the world. He uses the alias Flint Marko from that point on (he changed his name also to prevent his mother from discovering he was a criminal). After Floyd is released from prison, Marko escapes.

Marko flees to a nuclear testing site on a beach near Savannah, Georgia where he comes into contact with sand that had been irradiated by an experimental reactor, transforming his body into sand. Impressed, he calls himself the Sandman after his new powers.

Marko clashes with Peter Parker/Spider-Man for the first time in Peter&#x27;s high school. Spider-Man defeats Marko with a vacuum cleaner and hands it over to the police. The Sandman escapes by getting through his window after turning himself to sand, but is recaptured by the Human Torch after the Torch lures the Sandman to a building by disguising himself as Spider-Man, then activating the sprinkler system. After this Marko resurfaces as a member of the Sinister Six, led by Doctor Octopus. He battles Spider-Man inside an airtight metal box, which is activated when Spider-Man touches a card saying where the Vulture is, but the Sandman is defeated due to Spider-Man having stronger lungs than he does.

Alongside the Enforcers, he captures the Human Torch but later succumbs to Spider-Man and the Human Torch.

After Spider-Man defeats Marko numerous times, Marko diverts his attention to other superheroes. He teams with the Wizard, Paste-Pot Pete (later known as the Trapster) and Medusa to form the Frightful Four to combat the Fantastic Four, which attacks during Reed and Sue&#x27;s engagement party. The Fantastic Four, with the help of a few other superheroes, defeat the group. In another battle, in which he teams up with Blastaar and loses against the Four, he dons a diamond-patterned green costume designed by the Wizard. Later, he and the Hulk battle for the first time. The Mandarin joins him in his next conflict against the Hulk.

In time the Sandman discovers—-starting with his hands—-that his body can transform into glass and back again. He contracts cancer and takes over a medical research center, battling the Hulk again. He battles Wonder Man but is cured of his cancer by radiation.

Afterward, he allies himself with Hydro-Man to battle their mutual enemy, Spider-Man. An accident merges the two villains into a monster called the Mud-Thing. Spider-Man and the police are able to dehydrate the monstrosity. Months later, the supervillains manage to separate themselves and go their separate ways. The time he spent trapped with Hydro-Man caused Marko to question his bad life choices. The Thing, after an aborted attempt to fight Baker, urges him to straighten himself out and use his ability to do good. The story continues when he meets with the Thing for a second time to see a sports game.

Marko boards with the Cassadas and teams with Spider-Man against the Enforcers. The Sandman then makes sporadic appearances in Spider-Man comics assisting his former enemy. His first appearance has him coming to the rescue of Spider-Man and Silver Sable, who are outnumbered and surrounded by the Sinister Syndicate. Silver Sable is impressed by the Sandman&#x27;s performance and recruits him as a freelance operative. Doctor Octopus coerces him to rejoin the Sinister Six, but Marko turns against them. Doctor Octopus turns him into glass for his treason. Spider-Man, however, saved the Sandman. Sandman also appears as part of the Outlaws, a group of reformed Spider-Man enemies, such as the Prowler, the Rocket Racer, the Puma and the Will o&#x27; the Wisp, that on occasion that would aid Spider-Man.

Later, he receives a presidential pardon and briefly joins the Avengers as a reserve member. Later, he becomes a full-time mercenary in the employ of Silver Sable as a member of her Wild Pack, serving alongside heroes such as Paladin and Battlestar. The Sandman is one of the few heroes temporarily overwhelmed by their evil doubles during the Infinity War. This double almost kills them all.

Marko turns against Spider-Man and his sometimes ally the Thing and declares his allegiance to evil and his former employer, the Wizard. This change proved incompatible to what many fans had thought Sandman had become, a hero. This outcry caused Marvel to rush out a story which retconned &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; (vol. 2) #4 in which the Wizard had kidnapped the Sandman and used his mind control machine, the Id Machine, to turn him back into a villain.

The machine worked too well and the Sandman went about reforming the Sinister Six to destroy both Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus, only to be double-crossed by Venom, who the Sandman recruited as the sixth member of the team. During Venom&#x27;s brawl against the Sandman, the vicious black symbiote&#x27;s mouth rips a chunk of sand from the Sandman. That missing sand destabilizes the Sandman, causing him to lose his ability to maintain his human form. Before falling into the sewer (and as a nod to fans who rejected Marvel&#x27;s attempt to re-villainize the character), the Sandman admitted that part of the reason for his fall from grace was the trouble he had to really cope with life on the good guys&#x27; side, and asks Spider-Man to tell his mother he was sorry he did not fulfill his promise to her, to be a force for good. The Sandman washes away and slides down a sewer, from which he mixes into Jones Beach, New York and is thought dead.

The Sandman&#x27;s body and mind are scattered throughout the beach. This separation lasts too long for him, causing his mind to split into good and its opposite, evil, which when dominant created sand vortexes to ensnare beachcombers. Spider-Man arrived to confront the Sandman, ultimately using the Sandman&#x27;s mental instability to free his captives and cause him to explode.

His sand wafts throughout New York and touches down into piles forming beings that personify him: the good, the bad, the gentle and the innocent. Spider-Man locates these Sandmen to convince them to unify. The Sandman&#x27;s evil persona merges with his innocent and gentle personas, but the Sandman&#x27;s good persona rebuffs the evil one. Because the Sandman&#x27;s mind can handle his personality in separation for only a limited time, he loses his ability to retain himself, crumbling and blowing away, leaving Spider-Man to ponder the nature of his scuttled foe.

The Sandman is one of the villains recruited to recover the Identity Disc, but during its recovery seemingly he is killed in a mutiny. At the series&#x27; end, the Sandman is found alive and working with the Vulture to manipulate the other villains.

In the storyline &quot;Sandblasted&quot;, in &quot;Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man&quot; #17–19 (April–June 2007), the Sandman asks Spider-Man to help him redeem his father, who has been charged with and imprisoned for murdering a homeless man. He admits his father was a petty criminal, but insists he would not commit murder. Marko also said the victim resembles Peter Parker&#x27;s Uncle Ben, who had been murdered years before then. The Sandman and Spider-Man find the killer, the Chameleon 2211. The Chameleon 2211 kills the Uncle Ben who the Hobgoblin 2211 brought from an alternate universe and had been posing as him after that. Thanks to Spider-Man, Floyd Baker is switched with the Chameleon 2211 and saved, for which the Sandman thanks Spider-Man.

The Sandman returned in &quot;Spider-Man: The Gauntlet&quot; storyline, which redefined the character and his powers/mental state. While investigating a series of murders and a missing girl named Keemia Alvarado, whose mother is a victim of those murders, Spider-Man traces the murders and the abduction to the Sandman, the girl&#x27;s father, who is hiding on Governor&#x27;s Island with Keemia. The Sandman&#x27;s powers have evolved to where he can create duplicates of himself who have their own personalities and, to Marko&#x27;s shock, claim they committed the murders. Spider-Man sneaks away and uses a fan to obliterate the Sandmen. Originally Spider-Man believed Keemia would be handed to her grandmother, but instead she was sent to a foster home by Child Protective Services. Carlie Cooper is exonerated upon being under police suspicion for tampering with the murder evidences, but the Sandman is still at large.

During the &quot;Origin of the Species&quot; storyline, the Sandman is among the supervillains invited by Doctor Octopus to join his villains&#x27; team where he becomes involved in a plot to receive a reward and securing some specific items for him. The Sandman went after Spider-Man for Menace&#x27;s infant, believing that Doctor Octopus would reward him by reuniting him with Keemia. He ended up being accidentally struck with lightning by Electro, temporarily turning him into fulgurite. Spider-Man goes on a rampage against all the villains after the Chameleon stole the infant and tricked him into believing it had died. At the dock, the Sandman, along with the Shocker and the Enforcers, are hiding. However, Spider-Man collapses the floor of the building which falls into the water. The Sandman attempts to rise to attack, but Spider-Man shoots him using the Shocker&#x27;s vibrational air-blasts.

In &quot;Big Time&quot;, he is part of the new Sinister Six along with Mysterio, the Rhino, Doctor Octopus, the Chameleon and Electro. He rises up against Doctor Octopus&#x27; plan to detonate New York, saying Keemia is still there. He is later angered when, during a confrontation between the Sinister Six and the Intelligencia, Doctor Octopus teleports the Wizard into the upper atmosphere using the Intelligencia&#x27;s equipment. The Sandman was talking with his former Frightful Four teammate and old friend at the time. When the Mad Thinker goes after Electro, the Sandman violently attacks him, claiming that he did not want to lose any more friends.

When Doctor Octopus puts his plan into action, the Sandman is satisfied with the job because of the planned 2 billion dollar &quot;compensation fee&quot;, which he reasons will help him gain custody of Keemia. However, although sent to guard a facility in the Sahara Desert giving him complete control of the largest body of sand in the world, he is defeated by Spider-Man, the Black Widow and Silver Sable when Spider-Man identifies and isolates the one grain of sand that contains his conscious mind. Spider-Man and Silver Sable then violently interrogate the Sandman to reveal all of Doctor Octopus&#x27; secrets to them.

Following the &quot;Dying Wish&quot; storyline, the Sandman&#x27;s captive form is later stolen from the Baxter Building by the Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus&#x27; mind in Spider-Man&#x27;s body) where he takes him to his underwater lab. The Sandman, the Chameleon, Electro, Mysterion (an impersonator of Mysterio), and the Vulture are later seen as part of a team led by the Superior Spider-Man called the &quot;Superior Six&quot;. The Superior Spider-Man has been temporarily controlling their minds to redeem them for their crimes. He does this by forcing them to do heroic deeds against their will, some of which almost get some of them killed. Every time he is done controlling them, he puts them back in their containment cells. They eventually break free of the Superior Spider-Man&#x27;s control and attempt to exact revenge on the wall-crawler, while nearly destroying New York to do so. With the help of Sun Girl, the Superior Spider-Man is barely able to stop the Superior Six.

Inspired by the heroism of the villains who had their moralities inverted by the events of &quot;AXIS&quot;, the Sandman rejoins one of his old gangs and breaks into Ryker&#x27;s Island in search of the group&#x27;s leader Dixon. Upon reaching Dixon&#x27;s cell, the Sandman turns on and incapacitates him and his followers. He then leaves with Dixon&#x27;s cellmate, a &quot;good egg&quot; whom the Sandman had deemed deserving of a second chance.

During the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline, the Sandman is among the villains at the Kingpin&#x27;s viewing party of the incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610.

The Sandman later appears as a member of the Sinister Six led by Aaron Davis in a recolored Iron Spider armor. He accompanied the Sinister Six in a plot to steal a decommissioned S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier.

During the &quot;Infinity Wars&quot; storyline, the Sandman is among the villains that accompany Turk Barrett to his meeting with the Infinity Watch at Central Park.

The Sandman later discovered that he is starting to lose the consistency of his body. When the Mad Thinker and the Wizard are unable to find a solution to counter this and the Sandman is hospitalized after collapsing, he is visited by Spider-Man, who took him to the beach that the Sandman visited in his childhood and stayed with him until his body broke down. After that happened, Spider-Man discovered that the Sandman did not die and that he lost the ability to assume a human shape, where he now sports a blob-shaped body. When the Sandman&#x27;s body is taken over by a future version of the Sandman from Earth-51838 where the sun went out, Spider-Man received some of the Sandman&#x27;s powers and used them to defeat the Sandman of Earth-51838 and sends him back to his reality using the Multisect and assistance from the Human Torch. After bidding farewell to Spider-Man, the Sandman left to get adjusted to his new form while having developed a fear of his newly-discovered immortality.

At an unknown beach, Sandman somehow regains his human shape, but loses his sense of direction. Doctor Octopus helps Sandman regain his sense of direction, which pleases Kindred.

During the &quot;Sinister War&quot; storyline, Sandman was with the Sinister Six when they fight the Savage Six at the sight of a movie premiere that Mysterio was involved in.

Sandman was among the villains captured by Ultra Living Brain. When Spider-Man defeated the Sinister Six-type Super-Adaptoid, Ultra Living Brain teleported the villains away.

Following the &quot;Gang War&quot; storyline, Peter Parker encountered Sandman in Ravencroft at the time when he and Mary Jane were visiting Anna Watson. After Peter told him that a mutual friend of theirs told him about Sandman&#x27;s arrest, Sandman asks Peter to refer to him as William Baker and stated that he turned himself in while noting that he is trying to be good while parts of him are still bad. As Peter mentions that their mutual friend is Spider-Man, Sandman tries to go on a rampage only for a sonic inhibitor to prevent that. William states that Flint Marko is the bad part of him. Before Peter leaves, William advises him to inform Spider-Man that &quot;they&quot; will be coming to break Flint Marko out of Ravencroft. It then cuts to a shot of Doctor Octopus, Electro, Kraven the Hunter, Mysterio, and Vulture.

==Powers and abilities==
The Sandman has the ability to transform his body. He can will his body to be hardened, compacted, dispersed or shaped, or a combination of those qualities, an Earth manipulation of sand and rock particles. More often than not in combat, this ability enables him to absorb most blows with little to no ill effect other than reforming himself, a relatively fast action. His striped shirt and cargo pants are colored sand to make him appear as if he wears clothes. Even when soaked, he was able to stretch his sand molecules, growing to double his size.

Sandman can mold his arms and hands into shapes, such as a mace or a sledgehammer, to battle Spider-Man and his other enemies. His mass, strength and shape shifting ability correspond to the number of sand and rock particles that comprise him. The more he incorporates (nearby) sand grains and rock granules into his body, the more those qualities are enhanced. Even though he controls every particle in his body, his mind exists in the astral plane. He can turn himself into a sandstorm, which enables him to fly great distances and to suffocate his enemies.

His body takes on sand&#x27;s chemical qualities, impervious to many, but not all, elements. Once, cement&#x27;s ingredients were mixed into Sandman. That mixture turned him into cement that dried, rendering him immobile. Despite this frailty, he remained alive and in a coma-like state for a while before he returned to normal. In addition to his superb endurance, the Sandman possesses superhuman strength several times more than Spider-Man&#x27;s and on a par with the Thing&#x27;s.

In a story where Sandman worked with the Wizard, the Wizard fashioned Sandman a green armored suit with a belt that contained three buttons that allowed various chemicals to mix into the Sandman&#x27;s body to enable him to change himself into consistencies related to sand. The armor, like the Sandman&#x27;s usual &quot;clothes&quot;, changed into sand with him. Eventually, with the disbanding of the original Frightful Four, the Sandman stopped using the suit.

Temperature does alter the Sandman. At 3,400 degrees Fahrenheit his body turns into glass, also a form he can control. Unlike the Sandman&#x27;s fast transformation from sand to glass, his transformation from glass to sand takes time.

Although he is invulnerable to most physical attacks, even projectiles because they pass through him, water is capable of harming him. There are some exceptions, for example while fighting Venom, the villain&#x27;s powerful mouth ripped cleanly and swiftly into the Sandman. The amount of sand removed abruptly, and perhaps because of Venom&#x27;s venoms, left the mass of the Sandman in contortion, crippled beyond immediate repair. The Sandman began to disintegrate, then flowed down a drain, and then washed up onto and into a beach.

It has been revealed that, while the Sandman can absorb and lose sand, his body must retain one key particle of sand that contains his conscious mind, allowing Spider-Man to defeat him once by isolating that one grain from the rest of the Sandman (although the difficulty involved in setting up these events in the first place makes it impractical to use regularly).

==Family members==
This section lists the known relatives of Sandman:

* Floyd Baker - The father of William Baker, who was unaware that he was the Sandman during his time in prison.
* Keemia Alvarado - The foster child of the Sandman.
* Mrs. Baker (first name unknown) - The mother of William Baker.

==Other characters named the Sandman==
There have been some other characters in Marvel Comics that have been named the &quot;Sandman&quot;:

* In &quot;Marvel Mystery Comics&quot;, the Sandman that appears is the Sandman of legend. He lives in the Land of Dreams, which is located in the Realm of Fairies within the potentially imaginary world of Nowhere. The Sandman ruled over the realm and would place a blanket over it every day. Those who grabbed a dream from the dream tree would have a dream based on whatever they grabbed from the tree and awaken again when the Sandman removed the blanket over his land. Anyone who did not grab a dream would end up in an eternal, dreamless sleep.
* In &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot;, an alien Sandman crash-landed on Earth where he ended up in Mexico. The local tribespeople thought it was an evil spirit. They took him while he was still weak from his crash and sealed him in a cave with no air and light, where he remained in a state of suspended animation. By the early 1960s, a vacationing Marine named Steve Bronson and his family accidentally unleashed the alien Sandman on the world. The alien Sandman regained its consciousness, recounted its past to the Bronson family and planned to conquer the Earth. Steve Bronson tried to oppose the alien Sandman, but it proved invulnerable to physical assault. The alien Sandman ordered the Bronsons to transport him to North America, so he could observe the most powerful nation on the planet before putting his plan into action. Steve Bronson was able to alert the military to the alien Sandman&#x27;s presence, but they also proved ineffective in dealing with the extraterrestrial threat. Bullets went right through him, gas was ineffectual because he does not breathe and while bombs would scatter his pieces, he proved capable of reforming himself afterwards. The alien Sandman planned to increase its size by absorbing every sand on the beaches until nothing can stop him. Steve Bronson&#x27;s son Bobby heard about the plan and headed to the beach with a plan of his own. Bobby threw a pile of water over the sand, which made the alien Sandman soggy to the point where he could not move. The military quickly transported the alien Sandman&#x27;s body to a top-secret underground facility where he has remained ever since.
* There was an android version of the Sandman who was created by the Puppet Master and the Mad Thinker to fight the Fantastic Four.
* At the time when Sandman was with the Wild Pack, he fought an imposter Sandman alongside and imposter Doctor Doom. This version sports a mohawk and was created by Magus with help from Anthropomorpho.

* The Sandman was set to appear in &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (1994). However, the series&#x27; creators did not want to interfere with the continuity of James Cameron&#x27;s proposed &quot;Spider-Man&quot; film at the time, in which the Sandman was supposed to appear, and used Hydro-Man in his place. Also due to Cameron&#x27;s film, the Sandman did not appear in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; (1994).
* Flint Marko / Sandman appears in &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot;, voiced by John DiMaggio. First appearing in the pilot episode &quot;Survival of the Fittest&quot;, this version was a petty crook and partner of Alex O&#x27;Hirn who works for the crime boss Tombstone who eventually acquires sand-based powers and becomes an independent criminal to achieve a &quot;big score&quot;. After fighting Spider-Man on his own and with two iterations of the Sinister Six, Sandman seemingly sacrifices himself to contain an oil tanker explosion and goes into hiding.
* The Sandman appears in &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot;, voiced by Dee Bradley Baker. This version is a prison escapee who gained his powers in an explosion, with S.H.I.E.L.D. subsequently abandoning him on a deserted island in the Bermuda Triangle as no ordinary prison could hold him. After encountering him, Spider-Man gradually convinces Sandman to become a hero.
* Flint Marko / Sandman appears in a self-titled episode of &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (2017), voiced by Travis Willingham. This version is a former henchman of Hammerhead and has a daughter named Keemia Marko. After failing Hammerhead too many times, Flint was buried in sand and toxic waste and presumed dead, but was mutated and acquired sand-based powers. He is initially incapable of maintaining a humanoid form, but Spider-Man helps him stabilize his body before helping him rescue Keemia from Hammerhead.
* The Sandman appears in &quot;Spidey and His Amazing Friends&quot;, voiced by Thomas F. Wilson.

===Film===
* An original incarnation of the Sandman appears in James Cameron&#x27;s aborted &quot;Spider-Man&quot; film script, with Michael Biehn being considered for the role. This version would have been Carlton Strand&#x27;s henchman Boyd, who was mutated by an accident involving Philadelphia Experiment-esque bilocation and atom-mixing.
* Thomas Haden Church portrays Flint Marko / Sandman in two Marvel films. This version is portrayed as a tragic and sympathetic criminal who is desperate to raise money for his critically ill daughter, Penny, and gained his powers after an accident involving an experimental particle accelerator that bonded him with sand at the molecular level. Furthermore, he unintentionally killed Spider-Man&#x27;s uncle Ben Parker.
** Marko first appears in the Sony film &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; (2007). After escaping prison, he visits his family, but his upset ex-wife Emma forces him to leave. While on the run from police, he stumbles upon a particle physics test facility that transforms him into the Sandman. Using his newly-acquired powers, Marko attacks an armored car and is confronted by Spider-Man, but manages to escape. After Spider-Man obtains his black suit, which increases his aggressiveness, and learns that Marko was Ben&#x27;s killer, he fights and seemingly kills him in the sewers. Marko later reconstitutes himself and encounters Venom, who persuades him to join forces to kill Spider-Man. They kidnap Mary Jane Watson and lure Spider-Man to a construction site, where they nearly succeed until Harry Osborn intervenes and defeats Marko. Following the battle, Marko, now aware of Spider-Man&#x27;s identity, approaches him to apologize and come to terms with the truth about Ben&#x27;s murder: during the robbery, Marko tried to steal Ben&#x27;s car while holding the man at gunpoint, but his partner, Dennis Carradine, startled him, causing Marko to pull the trigger by accident. Shocked by what happened, Marko later turned himself in. Upon learning about Marko&#x27;s troubled history and what he had been through, Spider-Man forgives Marko and allows him to escape.
** Church reprises his role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; (2021), with director Jon Watts providing motion capture. Sometime after the events of &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot;, he ends up in another universe due to a botched spell, where he helps its version of Spider-Man (later dubbed &quot;Peter-One&quot;) defeat Electro before being teleported to and imprisoned in the New York Sanctum alongside other alternate universe-displaced supervillains. As his abilities become unstable and he starts to deteriorate, Marko receives a chance at a cure from Peter-One, but is convinced by the Green Goblin to fight back instead. Marko, adamant about returning to his universe, later assists Electro and the Lizard in fighting Peter-One until his version of Spider-Man cures him of his powers, reverting Marko to his human state before Doctor Strange returns him and the other displaced individuals to their respective universes.
* A member of the Elementals inspired by the Sandman appears in the MCU film &quot;Spider-Man: Far From Home&quot;. Identified as the Earth Elemental, it had power over rocks and sand. It attacked Mexico, during which it encountered Nick Fury and Maria Hill before Mysterio defeated it off-screen. Spider-Man later discovers the Elementals were illusions created by Mysterio and his fellow ex-Stark Industries employees as part of his plot to obtain Tony Stark&#x27;s technology and fraudulently establish himself as a superhero.

<doc id="411376" wikidata="Q703518" url="?curid=411376" title="National Flag Anthem of the Republic of China">
<text>The National Flag Anthem of the Republic of China () is a patriotic song typically played during the raising and lowering of the flag of the Republic of China. Domestically, the flag anthem is typically played immediately following the national anthem during flag ceremonies. It is also played at international sporting events such as the World Baseball Classic and Olympic Games, where Taiwan officially participates under the name of Chinese Taipei. The song is thus considered to be effectively a secondary national anthem; Republic of China nationals and supporters stand when it is performed and salute it as they would salute the national anthem.

== Origin ==
After the Kuomintang Anthem became the &quot;de facto&quot; National Anthem of the Republic of China in 1930, the Ministry of Education had invited submissions for a new official national anthem. The music composed by Huang Tzu was eventually chosen in 1936, but the Nationalist Government refused to adopt it as the national anthem. As a compromise, the National Anthem remained unchanged, while Huang Tzu&#x27;s music was adopted as the National Flag Anthem, with lyrics written in Classical Chinese usually attributed to Tai Chi-tao, who had also contributed to the lyrics of the National Anthem.

=== Dispute of the author of lyrics ===
According to Liu Yiling from the National Library of the Republic of China, there remains a dispute over the authorship of the lyrics. In some earlier publications, the lyrics were attributed as an anonymous work. However, later publications attributed it to Tai Chi-tao, who did compose a song with the title &quot;National Flag Anthem&quot; in 1928. Nevertheless, that work was very different from the current version. In 1929, Liang Desuo published &quot;Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth&quot;, and some attribute the authorship of the National Flag Anthem to him due to the resemblance between that work and the current lyrics.

== Use ==
Since 1983, the song (officially with different lyrics) was used at Olympic competitions instead of the National Anthem due to pressure from the Chinese Olympic Committee and the International Olympic Committee. This also changed the symbols used by Taiwan during the Olympics and other sporting events, and their name officially changed to &quot;Chinese Taipei&quot; (中華臺北). During the 2004 Summer Olympics, Chinese Taipei won its first gold medals, and the Banner Song was played at the ceremonial raising of the flag of the gold medal team. When introduced, the song is officially called the &quot;National Anthem of Chinese Taipei.&quot; However, in the 16th Asian Games held in Guangzhou, China, the song was introduced as the &quot;Anthem of the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee&quot; (中華臺北奧會會歌), with new lyrics written by Chang Pi-te (張彼德).
In schools and national monuments in Taiwan, the National Anthem and the National Flag Anthem are played every morning before classes or opening at an outdoor ceremony. The national anthem is sung while the flag is being held before raising and the National Flag Anthem is played when the National Flag is raised. When the flag is lowered, only the National Flag Anthem is played.

During the 2017 Summer Universiade held in Taipei, Taiwan, the song was introduced as the &quot;National Anthem of Chinese Taipei.&quot;

<text>The Battle of Tanagra took place during the Peloponnesian War in 426 BC between Athens, Tanagra and Thebes.

In 426 Athens sent a fleet to the island of Melos consisting of 60 ships and 2,000 hoplites under the command of Nicias. Melos had refused to join the Delian League, and still refused to do so even when the Athenians plundered the island. The Athenians, however, did not conquer the island, but instead sailed to Oropus on the coast of Boeotia. The hoplites landed on shore and marched towards Tanagra, where they were joined by the main Athenian army that had been marching from Athens under Hipponicus and Eurymedon. They plundered the countryside, and the next day defeated a combined Tanagran and Theban army, but returned to Athens after the victory.

<text>Child marriage is a marriage or domestic partnership, formal or informal, usually between a child and an adult, but can also be between a child and another child. 

Although the age of majority (legal adulthood) and marriage age are typically 18 years old, these thresholds can differ in different jurisdictions. In some regions, the legal age for marriage can be as young as 14, with cultural traditions sometimes superseding legal stipulations. Additionally, jurisdictions may allow marriages younger than the stipulated age where specific exceptions, such as parental or guardian consent, or anomalous events, such as teenage pregnancy, exist. 

Research has found that child marriages have many long-term negative consequences for child brides and grooms. Girls who marry as children often lack access to education and future career opportunities. It is also common for them to have adverse health effects resulting from early pregnancy and childbirth. Effects on child grooms may include the economic pressure of providing for a household and various constraints in educational and career opportunities. 

Child marriage is part of the practice of child betrothal, often including civil cohabitation and a court approval of the engagement. Some factors that encourage child marriages include poverty, bride price, dowries, cultural traditions, religious and social pressure, regional customs, fear of the child remaining unmarried into adulthood, illiteracy, and the perceived inability of women to work. 

Research indicates that comprehensive sex education can prevent child marriages. The rate of child marriages can also be reduced by strengthening rural communities&#x27; education systems. Rural development programs that provide basic infrastructure, including healthcare, clean water, and sanitation, may aid families financially.

Child marriages have historically been common and continue to be widespread, particularly in developing nations in Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia, West Asia, Latin America, and Oceania. However, developed nations also face this issue. In the United States, child marriage is legal in 38 states. 

Child marriage has been decreasing in prevalence in most parts of the world. UNICEF data from 2018 showed that about 21% of young women worldwide (aged 20 to 24) were married as children. This shows a 25% decrease from 10 years prior. The countries with the highest known rates of child marriages were Niger, Chad, Mali, Bangladesh, Guinea, the Central African Republic, Mozambique and Nepal, all of which had rates above 50% between 1998 and 2007. According to studies conducted between 2003 and 2009, the marriage rate of girls under 15 years old was greater than 20% in Niger, Chad, Bangladesh, Mali, and Ethiopia. Each year, an estimated 12 million girls globally are married under the age of 18.
In 2021, 13.3 million babies, or about 10% of all global births, were born to mothers aged under 20 years old.

==History==
Prior to the Industrial Revolution, women around the world were often married at an early age, usually soon after reaching puberty. These practices carried over well into the 19th century in societies with largely rural populations. Men tended to marry later in societies where a married couple was expected to establish a household of their own. This encouraged men to remain unmarried until they accumulated sufficient wealth to support a new home and marry adolescent girls.

In many ancient and medieval societies, it was common for girls to be betrothed at or even before the age of puberty. According to Mordechai A. Friedman, &quot;arranging and contracting the marriage of a young girl were the undisputed prerogatives of her father in Ancient Israel.&quot; Most girls were married before the age of 15, often at the start of puberty. It has been claimed that in the Middle Ages, marriage took place around puberty throughout the Jewish world.

Ruth Lamdan writes, &quot;The numerous references to child marriage in the 16th-century Responsa literature and other sources shows that child marriage was so common, it was virtually the norm. In this context, it is important to remember that in halakha, the term &quot;minor&quot; refers to a girl under twelve years and a day old. A girl aged twelve and a half was considered an adult in all respects.&quot;

In Ancient Greece, early marriage and teenage motherhood for girls existed. Boys were also expected to marry in their teens. In the Roman Empire, girls were married at the age of 12 and boys from the age of 14. In the Middle Ages, under English civil laws derived from Roman laws, marriages before the age of 16 existed. In Imperial China, child marriage was the norm.

In contrast to other pre-modern societies—and for reasons that are subject to debate—Northwest Europe was characterized by relatively late marriages for both men and women, with both sexes commonly delaying marriage until their mid-20s, although the very wealthy, especially aristocrats, married earlier, but they were a minority of the population. The data available for England suggest this was the case by the 14th century. The pattern was reflected in English Common Law, which was the first in Western Europe to establish statutory rape laws and ages of consent for marriage. In 1275, sexual relations with girls under either 12 or 14 (depending on the interpretation of the sources) were criminalized; a second law with more severe punishments for those under the age of 10 was enacted in 1576. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the British colonial administration introduced marriage age restrictions for Hindu and Muslim girls in the Indian subcontinent.

A Scottish physician living in 18th century Syria reported that locals tried to contract marriages for their children at a young age, but the marriage was not consummated until the girl &quot;had come of age&quot;. Evidence from 19th century Levant, (now Israel and Palestine) suggests that husbands often initiated sexual relations before their wives reached puberty, but that it was a disapproved occurrence, condemned socially and censured by sharia courts. Writing in the 1830s, Edward William Lane observed that few Egyptian girls remained single by the age of 16, but socioeconomic transformation, educational reform, and modernity brought significant changes. By 1920, less than 10% of Egyptian women married before the age of 20. In 1923, Egypt&#x27;s parliament set the minimum age of marriage at 16 for women and 18 for men.

For the latter half of the 19th century, between 13 and 18% of native-born white female first marriages in the United States were of girls under the age of 18.

==Religious norms and laws==
Most religions practiced throughout history have established a minimum age for marriage. Christian canon law forbade the marriage of a girl before the onset of puberty. Within the Catholic Church, before the 1917 Code of Canon Law, the minimum age for a dissoluble betrothal (&quot;&quot;) was seven years in the s. The minimal age for a valid marriage was puberty, or nominally 14 for males, and 12 for females. The 1917 Code of Canon Law raised the minimal age for a valid marriage to 16 for males, and 14 for females. The 1983 Code of Canon Law maintained the minimal age for a valid marriage at 16 for males and 14 for females. English ecclesiastical law forbade the marriage of a girl before the age of puberty.

Jewish halakhists and rabbis prohibit a father from betrothing a daughter while she is still a minor. A girl can be betrothed when she becomes a young woman (), which may defined as a girl aged 12-12½ or one who has begun puberty. In exceptional cases, such as during exile and persecution, girls aged 4-13 years may be betrothed by their fathers. Betrothal by intercourse is forbidden and punishable by lashing. The Talmud states that, &quot;those who marry girls who are not yet capable of bearing children&quot; will &quot;delay the coming of the messiah&quot;. A wide age gap between spouses, in either direction, is advised against. Marrying one&#x27;s young daughter to an old man was declared as reprehensible as forcing her into prostitution. The ideal age at which a man should marry is 18. Before this age, he should spend his time studying and getting his life in order.

There is no minimum marriage age defined in traditional Islamic law; the legal discussion of this topic is centered primarily on women&#x27;s physical maturity. Classical Sunni jurisprudence allows a father to contract a marriage for his underaged daughter. The appropriate age for consummating the marriage, which could occur several years after signing the marriage contract, was to be determined by the bride, groom, and the bride&#x27;s guardian since medieval jurists held that the age of fitness for intercourse was too variable for legislation. This was based in part on the precedent set by the Islamic prophet Muhammad, as described in the hadith collections considered to be authentic by Muslims. According to these sources, Muhammad married Aisha, his third wife, when she was about six, and consummated the marriage when she was about nine. Some modern Muslim authors and Islamic scholars, such as Ali Gomaa, who served as the Grand Mufti of Egypt, doubt the traditionally accepted narrative and believe based on other evidence that Aisha was in her late teens at the time of her marriage. As a general rule, intercourse was prohibited for girls &quot;not able to undergo it,&quot; on the grounds of potential physical harm. Disputes regarding physical maturity between the involved parties were to be resolved by a judge, potentially after examination by a female expert witness. The 1917 Codification of Islamic Family Law in the Ottoman Empire distinguished between the age of competence for marriage, which was set at 18 for boys and 17 for girls, and the minimum age for marriage, set at 12 for boys and 9 for girls. Marriage below the age of competence was permissible only if proof of sexual maturity was accepted in court, while marriage under the minimum age was forbidden. During the 20th century, sharia-based legislation in most countries in the Middle East followed the Ottoman precedent in defining the age of competence, while raising the minimum age to 15–16 for boys and 13–16 for girls. In 2019, Saudi Arabia raised the age of marriage to 18.

In Hinduism the Vedas, specifically the Rigveda and Atharvaveda, have several verses that indicate girls were only to be married long after attaining puberty. However, during the Vedic period, there is indication that girls were married before attaining and also during puberty. Some early Dharmaśāstra, which are secondary texts (&quot;Smritis&quot;) to the Vedas (&quot;Srutis&quot;), also state that girls should be married after they have attained puberty, while some Dharmaśāstra texts extend the marriageable age to before puberty. It should be understood that Smritis are descriptions of recommended laws for the times and Vedas are the ultimate authority. Nonetheless, Smritis were often followed by society until they were revised or amended, similar to constitutions or other forms of law.

In the Manusmriti, a father is considered to have wronged his daughter if he fails to marry her before puberty and if the girl is not married in less than three years after reaching puberty, she can search for the husband herself. However, in modern India, the minimum age of marriage is 21 years for males and 18 years for females as per both the Hindu Marriage Act and the Special Marriage Act. The Hindu Marriage Act is applicable and valid for all Hindus including Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs who altogether form more than 83% of Indian population.

By the beginning of the 21st century, most countries had enacted laws establishing the general minimum age for marriage at 18 years. However, in many of these countries, some exceptions allowed marriage before this age with the consent of the parents and/or by court decision. In some countries, a religious marriage is still recognized by the state authorities, while in others, a registered civil marriage is mandatory.

==Problems (Gendered effects)==
Child marriage has lasting consequences on girls, from their health (mental and physical), education, and social development perspectives. These consequences last well beyond adolescence. One of the most common causes of death for girls aged 15 to 19 in developing countries was pregnancy and childbirth. In Niger, estimated to have the world&#x27;s highest rate of child marriage, approximately three out of four girls marry before their 18th birthday. 

Boys are sometimes married as children, almost always to a female minor. UNICEF states that &quot;girls [are] disproportionately affected by the practice. Globally, the prevalence of child marriage among boys is just one-sixth that among girls.&quot; Research on the effects of child marriage on underage boys is scant, which researchers state is likely because child marriage involving boys is less common and boys do not face the adverse health effects as a result of early pregnancy and childbirth. The effects of child marriage on boys include being ill-prepared for certain responsibilities such as providing for the family, early fatherhood, and a lack of access to education and career opportunities. , 156 million living men were married as underage boys.

In its first in-depth analysis of child grooms, UNICEF revealed that an estimated 115 million boys and men around the world were married as children. Of these, 1 in 5, or 23 million, boys were married before the age of 15. According to the data, the Central African Republic has the highest prevalence of child marriage among males (28%), followed by Nicaragua (19%) and Madagascar (13%). The estimates bring the total number of child brides and child grooms to 765 million. Girls remain disproportionately affected, with 1 in 5 young women aged 20 to 24 years old married before their 18th birthday, compared to 1 in 30 young men.

==Causes==
According to the United Nations Population Fund, factors that promote and reinforce child marriage include poverty and economic survival strategies; gender inequality; sealing land or property deals or settling disputes; control over sexuality and protecting family honor; tradition and culture; and insecurity, particularly during war, famine or epidemics. Other factors include family ties in which marriage is a means of consolidating powerful relations between families.

===Dowry and bride price===

Providing a girl with a dowry at her marriage is an ancient practice that continues in some parts of the world, especially in the Indian subcontinent. Parents bestow property on the marriage of a daughter as a dowry, which is often an economic challenge for many families. The difficulty in saving for dowry was common, particularly in times of economic hardship, or persecution, or unpredictable seizure of property and savings. These difficulties pressed families to betroth their girls, irrespective of their age, as soon as they had the resources to pay the dowry. Thus, Goitein notes that European Jews would marry their girls early, once they had collected the expected amount of dowry.

A bride price is the amount paid by the groom to the parents of a bride for them to consent to him marrying their daughter. In some countries, the younger the bride, the higher the bride price. This practice can create an economic incentive where girls are sought and married early by her family to the highest bidder. Child marriages of girls can function as a way out of desperate economic conditions or simply as a source of income for the parents. Bride price is another cause of child marriage and child trafficking.

===Bride kidnapping===
Bride kidnapping, also known as marriage by abduction or marriage by capture, is a practice in which a male abducts the female he wishes to marry. Bride kidnapping has been practiced around the world and throughout history. It continues to occur in countries in Central Asia, the Caucasus region, parts of Africa, among people as diverse as the Hmong in Southeast Asia, the Tzeltal in Mexico, and the Romani in Europe. Bride kidnapping is a widespread issue in Ethiopia. A 2003 study found the custom&#x27;s prevalence rate was estimated at 69 percent nationally, with reports of girls as young as 11 being taken for marriage. In response, Ethiopia has enacted laws to outlaw this practice and established a minimum marriage age of 18. However, the effectiveness of these measures in reducing bride kidnapping remains unclear.

In most nations, bride kidnapping is considered a crime rather than a valid form of marriage. Some types of it may also be seen as falling along the continuum between forced marriage and arranged marriage. However, even when the practice is against the law, judicial enforcement remains lax in some areas. Bride kidnapping occurs in various parts of the world, but it is most common in the Caucasus and Central Asia. Bride kidnapping is often a form of child marriage. It may be connected to the practice of bride price, and the inability or unwillingness to pay it.

===Persecution, forced migration, and slavery===
Social upheavals such as wars, major military campaigns, forced religious conversion, taking natives as prisoners of war and converting them into slaves, arrest and forced migrations of people often made a suitable groom a rare commodity. Bride&#x27;s families would seek out any available bachelors and marry them to their daughters before events beyond their control moved the boy away. Persecution and displacement of Roma and Jewish people in Europe, colonial campaigns to get slaves from various ethnic groups in West Africa across the Atlantic for plantations, and Islamic campaigns to get Hindu slaves from India across Afghanistan&#x27;s Hindu Kush as property and for work were some of the historical events that increased the practice of child marriage before the 19th century.

Among Sephardi Jewish communities, child marriages became frequent from the 10th to 13th centuries, especially in Muslim Spain. This practice intensified after the Jewish community was expelled from Spain, and resettled in the Ottoman Empire. Child marriages among the Eastern Sephardic Jews continued through the 18th century in Islamic majority regions.

===Fear, poverty, social pressures, and a sense of protection===
A sense of social insecurity is a cause of child marriages across the world. For example, in Nepal, parents fear social stigma if adult daughters (past 18 years) stay at home. Others fear crimes such as rape, which not only would be traumatic but may lead to less acceptance of the girl if she becomes a victim of such a crime. For example, girls may not be seen as eligible for marriage if they are not virgins. In other cultures, the fear is that an unmarried girl may engage in illicit relationships, or elope, causing a permanent social blemish to her siblings, or that the impoverished family may be unable to find bachelors for grown-up girls in their socioeconomic group. Such fears and social pressures have been proposed as causes that lead to child marriages. Insofar as child marriage is a social norm in practicing communities, the elimination of child marriage must come through a changing of those social norms. The mindset of the communities, and what is believed to be the proper outcome for a child bride, must be shifted to bring about a change in the prevalence of child marriage.

Families in extreme poverty may perceive daughters as an economic burden. If they cannot afford to raise a child, seeking a child marriage for a girl can be seen as a way of ensuring her economic security and thus benefiting her as well as her parents. In reviews of Jewish community history, scholars claim poverty, shortage of grooms, and uncertain social and economic conditions were a cause of frequent child marriages.
An additional factor causing child marriage is the parental belief that early marriage offers protection. Parents feel that marriage provides their daughter with a sense of protection from sexual promiscuity and safe from sexually transmitted infections. However, in reality, young girls tend to marry older men, placing them at an increased risk of contracting a sexually transmitted infection.

Protection through marriage may play a specific role in conflict settings. Families may have their young daughters marry members of an armed group or military in hopes that they will be better protected. Girls may also be taken by armed groups and forced into marriages.

In many communities, there is social pressure to marry off girls at a young age. This practice is often justified by cultural norms and the belief that it provides social and economic stability.

===Climate disasters===
In 2023, a study led by Ohio State researchers, Fiona Doherty, Smitha Rao, and Angelise Radney found that the increase in environmental disasters tied to climate change were contributing factor to a rise in child marriage in at least 20 countries.

===Religion, culture and civil law===
Although the general marriageable age is 18 in the majority of countries, most jurisdictions allow for exceptions for underage youth with parental and/or judicial consent. Such laws are neither limited to developing countries, nor a state&#x27;s religion. In some countries, a religious marriage by itself has legal validity, while in others it does not, as civil marriage is obligatory. For Catholics incorporated into the Latin Church, the 1983 Code of Canon Law sets the minimum age for a valid marriage at 16 for males and 14 for females. In 2015, Spain raised its minimum marriageable age to 18 (16 with court consent) from the previous 14. In Mexico, marriage under 18 is allowed with parental consent, from age 14 for girls and age 16 for boys. In Ukraine, in 2012, the Family Code was amended to equalize the marriageable age for girls and boys to 18, with courts being allowed to grant permission to marry from 16 years of age if it is established that the marriage is in the best interest of the youth.

Many states in the US permit child marriages with the court&#x27;s permission. Since 2015, the minimum marriageable age throughout Canada is 16. In Canada, the age of majority is set by province/territory at 18 or 19, so minors under this age have additional restrictions (i.e. parental and court consent). Under the Criminal Code, Art. 293.2 Marriage under the age of 16 years reads: &quot;Everyone who celebrates, aids or participates in a marriage rite or ceremony knowing that one of the persons being married is under the age of 16 years is guilty of an indictable offense and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years.&quot; The Civil Marriage Act also states: &quot;2.2 No person who is under the age of 16 years may contract marriage.&quot; In the UK, marriage is allowed for 16–17 years old with parental consent in England and Wales as well as in Northern Ireland, and even without parental consent in Scotland. However, a marriage of a person under 16 is void under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. The United Nations Population Fund stated the following:

A lower legally allowed marriage age does not necessarily cause high rates of child marriages. However, there is a correlation between restrictions placed by laws and the average age of first marriage. In the United States, per 1960 census data, 3.5% of girls married before the age of 16, while an additional 11.9% married between 16 and 18. States with lower marriage age limits saw higher percentages of child marriages. This correlation between the higher age of marriage in civil law and the observed frequency of child marriages breaks down in countries with Islam as the state religion. In Islamic nations, many countries do not allow child marriage of girls under their civil code of laws, but the state-recognized Sharia religious laws and courts in all these nations have the power to override the civil code, and often do. UNICEF reports that the top eight nations in the world with the highest observed child marriage rates are Niger (75%), Chad (72%), Mali (71%), Bangladesh (64%), Guinea (63%), Central African Republic (61%), Mozambique (56%), and Nepal (51%).

===Marriageable age in religious sources===
====Judaism====
Ancient Rabbis set the age of marriage for every Israelite at 18 years old; males are expected to be married by 20 years old in teenage marriage and females can stay unmarried but must be celibate.

In Rabbinic Judaism, males cannot consent to marriage until they reach the age of 13 years and a day and have undergone puberty. They are considered minors until the age of twenty. The same rules apply to females, except their age is 12 years and a day. If females show no signs of puberty and males show no signs of puberty or do show impotence, they automatically become adults by age 35 and can marry.

A large age gap between spouses, in either direction, is advised against as unwise. A younger woman marrying a significantly older man however is especially problematic: marrying one&#x27;s young daughter to an old man was declared as reprehensible as forcing her into prostitution.

A &quot;ketannah&quot; (literally meaning &quot;little [one]&quot;) was any girl between the age of 3 years and 12 years plus one day; she was subject to her father&#x27;s authority, and he could arrange a marriage for her without her agreement. However, after reaching the age of maturity, she would have to agree to the marriage to be considered married.

====Christianity====
The minimum ages of consent for marriage in the Catholic Church are 14 for girls and 16 for boys. Being underage constitutes a diriment impediment. That is, a marriage involving an underage bride or groom is canonically invalid. A Conference of Bishops may adopt a higher age for marriage, but in that case, the higher age only creates a prohibitive impediment, that is, a marriage involving a bride or groom above the Church&#x27;s minimum age but below that set by the Conference is &quot;valid but illicit&quot;. Permission to marry against a civil authority&#x27;s directive requires the permission of the Ordinary, which, in the case of sensible and equal laws regarding marriage age, is not usually granted. The permission by the Ordinary is also required in case of a marriage of a minor when their parents are unaware of his marriage or if their parents reasonably oppose the marriage.

====Islam====
In classical Islamic law, suitability for marital relations is conditional on physical maturity (&quot;bulugh&quot;) and mental maturity (&quot;rushd&quot;). Classical jurists did not stipulate a minimum marriageable age because they did not believe that maturity is reached by everyone at a specific age. Büchler and Schlater observe that &quot;marriageable age according to classical Islamic law coincides with the occurrence of puberty. The notion of puberty refers to signs of physical maturity such as the emission of semen or the onset of menstruation&quot;. Traditional schools of Islamic jurisprudence (madhaahib) define the age of full legal capacity to enter marriage as follows:
According to Büchler and Schlater, while marriageable age is not the same as the legal majority under civil law, these age limits may correspond.

The 1917 codification of Islamic family law in the Ottoman Empire distinguished between the age of competence for marriage, which was set at 18 for boys and 17 for girls, and the minimum age for marriage, which followed the traditional Hanafi ages of the legal majority of 12 for boys and 9 for girls. Marriage below the age of competence was permissible only if proof of sexual maturity was accepted in court, while marriage under the minimum age was forbidden. During the 20th century, most countries in the Middle East followed the Ottoman precedent in defining the age of competence, while raising the minimum age to 15 or 16 for boys and 13–16 for girls. Marriage below the age of competence is subject to approval by a judge and the legal guardian of the adolescent. Egypt diverged from this pattern by setting the age limits of 18 for boys and 16 for girls, without a distinction between competence for marriage and minimum age. In 2020, Saudi Arabia officially banned all marriages under the age of 18. The push to ban child marriage was initially opposed by senior clergy, who argued that a woman reaches adulthood at puberty. However, by 2019 the Saudi Shura Council had outlawed marriages under the age of 15 and required court approval for those under 18.

===Politics and financial relationships===

Child marriages may depend upon socio-economic status. The aristocracy in some cultures, as in the European feudal era tended to use child marriage as a method to secure political ties. Families were able to cement political and/or financial ties by having their children marry. The betrothal is considered a binding contract between the families and the children. The breaking of a betrothal can have serious consequences both for the families and for the betrothed individuals themselves.

==Effects on global regions==
A UNFPA report stated: &quot;For the period 2000–2011, just over one third (an estimated 34 percent) of women aged 20 to 24 years in developing regions were married or in union before their eighteenth birthday. In 2010 this was equivalent to almost 67 million women. About 12 percent of them were married or in union before age 15.&quot; The prevalence of child marriage varies substantially among countries. Around the world, girls from rural areas are twice as likely to marry as children as those from urban areas.

===Africa===

According to UNICEF, Africa has the highest incidence rates of child marriage, with over 50% of girls marrying under the age of eighteen in five nations. Girls in West and Central Africa have the highest risk of marrying in childhood. Niger has one of the highest rates of early marriage in sub-Saharan Africa. Among Nigerien women between the ages of twenty and twenty-four, 76% reported marrying before the age of eighteen, and 28% reported marrying before the age of fifteen. This UNICEF report is based on data that is derived from a small sample survey between 1995 and 2004, and the current rate is unknown given the lack of infrastructure and in some cases, regional violence.

UNICEF stated in 2018 that although the number of child marriages has declined on a worldwide scale, the problem remains most severe in Africa, despite the fact that Ethiopia cut child marriage rates by one third.

African countries have enacted marriageable age laws to limit marriage to a minimum age of 16 to 18, depending on the jurisdiction. In Ethiopia, Chad and Niger, the legal marriage age is 15, but local customs and religious courts have the power to allow marriages below 12 years of age. Child marriages of girls in West Africa, Central Africa and Northeast Africa are widespread. Additionally, poverty, religion, tradition, and conflict make the rate of child marriage in Sub-Saharan Africa very high in some regions.

In many traditional systems, a man pays a bride price to the girl&#x27;s family to marry her (comparable to the customs of dowry and dower). In many parts of Africa, this payment, in cash, cattle, or other valuables, decreases as a girl gets older. Even before a girl reaches puberty, it is common for a married girl to leave her parents to be with her husband. Many marriages are related to poverty, with parents needing the bride price of a daughter to feed, clothe, educate, and house the rest of the family. In Mali, the female-to-male ratio of marriage before age 18 is 72:1; in Kenya, 21:1.

The various reports indicate that in many Sub-Saharan countries, there is a high incidence of marriage among girls younger than 15. Many governments have tended to overlook the particular problems resulting from child marriage, including obstetric fistulae, premature births, stillbirth, sexually transmitted diseases (including cervical cancer), and malaria.

In parts of Ethiopia and Nigeria, many girls are married before the age of 15, some as young as 7. In parts of Mali, 39% of girls are married before the age of 15. In Niger and Chad, over 70% of girls are married before the age of 18. Over fifty million women in Africa were married before the age of 18.

====The Gambia====
In 2016, during a feast ending the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, Gambian President Yahya Jammeh announced that child and forced marriages were banned.

====Kenya====
In Kenya, 23% of girls are married before age 18, including 4% by age 15.

==== Malawi ====
In 2015, Malawi passed a law banning child marriage, which raises the minimum age for marriage to 18. This major accomplishment came following years of effort by the Girls Empowerment Network campaign, which ultimately led to tribal and traditional leaders banning the cultural practice of child marriage.

====Morocco====
In Morocco, child marriage is a common practice. Over 41,000 marriages every year involve child brides. Before 2003, child marriages did not require a court&#x27;s or state&#x27;s approval. In 2003, Morocco passed the family law (&quot;Moudawana&quot;) that raised the minimum age of marriage for girls from 14 to 18, with the exception that underage girls may marry with the permission of the government-recognized official/court and girl&#x27;s guardian. Over the 10 years preceding 2008, requests for child marriages have been predominantly approved by Morocco&#x27;s Ministry for Social Development, and have increased (c. 29% of all marriages). Some child marriages in Morocco are a result of Article 475 of the Moroccan penal code, a law that allows rapists to avoid punishment if they marry their underage victims. Article 475 was amended in January 2014 after much campaigning, and rapists can legally no longer avoid sentencing by marrying their victims.

====Mozambique====
In 2019, Mozambique&#x27;s national assembly passed a law prohibiting child marriage. This law came after national movements condemning Mozambique&#x27;s high rate of child marriage, with 50% of girls marrying under the age of 18.

====Nigeria====
As of 2006, 15–20% of school dropouts in Nigeria were the result of child marriage. In 2013, Nigeria attempted to change Section 29, Subsection 4 of its laws and thereby prohibit child marriages. Christianity and Islam are each practiced by roughly half of its population, and the country continues with personal laws from its British colonial-era laws, in which child marriages are forbidden for its Christians and allowed for its Muslims. In Nigeria, child marriage is a divisive topic and widely practiced. In northern states, which are predominantly Muslim, over 50% of the girls marry before the age of 15.

==== South Africa ====
In South Africa, the law provides for respecting the marriage practices of traditional marriages, whereby a person might be married as young as 12 for females and 14 for males. Early marriage is cited as &quot;a barrier to continuing education for girls (and boys)&quot;. This includes &quot;absuma&quot; (arranged marriages set up between cousins at birth in a local Islamic ethnic group), bride kidnapping, and elopement decided on by the children.

==== Tanzania====
In 2016, the Tanzanian High Court – in a case filed by the &quot;Msichana Initiative&quot;, a lobbying group that advocates for girls&#x27; right to education – ruled in favor of protecting girls from the harms of early marriage. It is now illegal for anyone younger than 18 to marry in Tanzania.

==== Zimbabwe ====
A 2015 Human Rights Watch report stated that in Zimbabwe, one-third of women aged between 20 and 49 years old had married before reaching the age of 18. In January 2016, two women who had been married as children brought a court case requesting a change in the legal age of marriage to the Constitutional Court, with the result that the court declared that 18 is to be the minimum age for a legal marriage for both men and women (previously the legal age had been 16 for women and 18 for men). The law took effect immediately and was hailed by several human rights, women&#x27;s rights, medical, and legal groups as a landmark ruling for the country.

===Americas===
====Latin America====
Child marriage is common in Latin America and the Caribbean island nations. About 29% of girls were married before age 18 (as of 2007). The Dominican Republic, Honduras, Brazil, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Haiti, and Ecuador report some of the highest rates in the Americas, while Bolivia and Guyana have shown the sharpest decline in child marriage rates as of 2012. Brazil is ranked fourth in the world in terms of absolute numbers of girls married or cohabitating by age 15.

Poverty and lack of laws mandating minimum age for marriage have been cited as reasons for child marriage in Latin America. In an effort to combat the widespread belief among poor, rural, and indigenous communities that child marriage is a route out of poverty, some NGOs are working with communities in Latin America to shift norms and create safe spaces for adolescent girls.

In Guatemala, early marriage is most common among indigenous Mayan communities. In southeastern Colombia, historically the indigenous Nasa sometimes married at early ages to dissuade colonizers from coercively taking girls. In 2024, Colombia&#x27;s congress voted to change the minimum age from 14 (with parental consent) to 18.

In 2023, 300,000 girls under the age of 18 were sold into marriage in the Mexican state of Guerrero alone. In 2024, the Mexican Senate voted unanimously to abolish the practices of child marriage in indigenous communities in Mexico, considering children&#x27;s rights to be more important than tradition and customs.

====Canada====
Since 2015, the minimum marriageable age throughout Canada is 16. In Canada, the age of majority is set by province/territory at 18 or 19, so minors under this age have additional restrictions (i.e. parental and court consent). Under the Criminal Code, Art. 293.2 Marriage under the age of 16 years reads: &quot;Everyone who celebrates, aids or participates in a marriage rite or ceremony knowing that one of the persons being married is under the age of 16 years is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years.&quot; The Civil Marriage Act also states: &quot;2.2 No person who is under the age of 16 years may contract marriage.&quot;

According to a study from McGill University, from 2000 to 2018, 3,600 marriage certificates were issued to children (mostly girls) under 18 in Canada.

====United States====

Child marriage, as defined by Committee on the Rights of the Child and UNICEF, is observed in the United States. The UNICEF definition of child marriage includes couples who are formally married, or who live together as a sexually active couple in an informal union, with at least one member – usually the girl – being less than 18 years old. The latter practice is more common in the United States, and it is officially called cohabitation. According to a 2010 report by the United States&#x27; National Center for Health Statistics, 2.1% of all girls in the 15–17 age group were either in a child marriage or in an informal union. In the age group of 15–19, 7.6% of all girls in the United States were formally married or in an informal union. The child marriage rates were higher for certain ethnic groups and states. In Hispanic groups, for example, 6.6% of all girls in the 15–17 age group were formally married or in an informal union, and 13% of the 15–19 age group were. Over 350,000 babies are born to teenage mothers every year in the United States, and over 50,000 of these are second babies to teen mothers.

Laws regarding child marriage vary in the different states of the United States. Generally, children 16 and over may marry with parental consent, with the age of 18 being the minimum in all but two states to marry without parental consent. However, all states but 12 have exceptions for child marriage within their laws, and although those under 16 generally require a court order in addition to parental consent, when those exceptions are taken into account, four states have no minimum age requirement. It is the only UN member state that has not yet ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

Until 2008, the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints practiced child marriage through the concept of &quot;spiritual marriage&quot; as soon as it was possible for girls to bear children, as part of its polygamy practice, but laws have raised the age of legal marriage in response to criticism of the practice. In 2007, church leader Warren Jeffs was convicted of being an accomplice to statutory rape of a minor due to arranging a marriage between a 14-year-old girl and a 19-year-old man. In March 2008, officials of the state of Texas believed that children at the Yearning For Zion Ranch were being married to adults and were being abused. The state of Texas removed all 468 children from the ranch and placed them into temporary state custody. After the Austin&#x27;s 3rd Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court of Texas ruled that Texas acted improperly in removing them from the YFZ Ranch, the children were returned to their parents or relatives. In 2008, the Church changed its policy in the United States to no longer marry individuals younger than the local legal age.

, child marriage is legal in 38 states. Twelve states have banned underage marriages, with no exception: Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Rhode Island, New York, Massachusetts, Vermont, Connecticut, Michigan, and Washington.

In 2018, Delaware became the first state to ban child marriage without exceptions, followed by New Jersey the same year. Pennsylvania and Minnesota ended child marriage in 2020, followed by Rhode Island and New York in 2021, Massachusetts in 2022, Vermont, Connecticut, and Michigan in 2023 and Washington and Virginia in 2024.

Between 2000 and 2018, some 300,000 minors were legally married in the United States. Some as young as 10. Most child marriages in the US are girls marrying adult men. In fact, many of these marriages occurred at an age or with a spousal age difference that would typically be considered sexual violence.

===Asia===
More than half of all child marriages occur in the South Asian countries of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal. There was a decrease in the rates of child marriage across the Indian subcontinent from 1991 to 2007, but the decrease was observed among young adolescent girls and not girls in their late teens. Some scholars believe this age-specific reduction was linked to girls increasingly attending school until about age 15 and then marrying.

====Western Asia====
A 2013 report claims 53% of all married women in Afghanistan were married before age 18, and 21% of all were married before age 15. Afghanistan&#x27;s official minimum age of marriage for girls is 15 with her father&#x27;s permission. In all 34 provinces of Afghanistan, the customary practice of &quot;ba&#x27;ad&quot; is another reason for child marriages; this custom involves village elders, or &quot;jirga&quot;, settling disputes between families or unpaid debts or ruling punishment for a crime by forcing the guilty family to give their 5- to 12-year-old girls as wives. Sometimes a girl is forced into child marriage for a crime her uncle or distant relative is alleged to have committed. Andrew Bushell claims the rate of marriage of 8- to 13-year-old girls exceeds 50% in Afghan refugee camps along the Pakistan border.

The widespread prevalence of child marriage in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been documented by human rights groups. Saudi clerics have justified the marriage of girls as young as 9, with sanction from the judiciary. No laws define a minimum age of consent in Saudi Arabia, though drafts for possible laws have been created since 2011. Members of the Saudi Shoura Council in 2019 approved fresh regulations for minor marriages that will outlaw the marrying of 15-year-olds and force the need for court approval for those under 18. Chairman of the Human Rights Committee at the Shoura Council, Dr. Hadi Al-Yami, said that the introduced controls were based on in-depth studies presented to the body. He pointed out that the regulation, vetted by the Islamic Affairs Committee at the Shoura Council, has raised the age of marriage to 18 and prohibited it for those under 15. Saudi Arabia has officially updated the law, banning all marriages under the age of 18.

Research by the United Nations Population Fund indicates that 28.2% of marriages in Turkey – almost one in three – involve girls under 18.

Child marriage was also found to be prevalent among Syrian and Palestinian-Syrian refugees in Lebanon, in addition to other forms of sexual and gender-based violence. Marriage was seen as a potential way to protect family honor and protect a girl from rape, given how common rape was during the conflict. Incidents of child marriages increased in Syria and among Syrian refugees over the course of the conflict. The proportion of Syrian refugee girls living in Jordan who were married increased from 13% in 2011 to 32% in 2014. Journalists Magnus Wennman and Carina Bergfeldt documented the practice, and some of its results.

====Southeast Asia====
Hill tribe girls are often married young. For the Karen people, it is possible that two couples can arrange their children&#x27;s marriage before the children are born.

==== Indonesia ====
In a move to curb child marriage in Indonesia, the minimum marriage age for girls in Indonesia was raised to 19 in 2019, equalizing it to that of males. Previously, under the 1974 marriage law, the marriage age for girls was 16, and there was no minimum with judicial consent.

There has been an increase in underage marriage which has been attributed to a rise in social networking sites like Facebook. It has been reported that in areas like Gunung Kidul, Yogyakarta, couples become acquainted through Facebook and continue their relationships until girls become pregnant. Under Indonesian law, underage marriage is prosecuted as sexual abuse, though unregistered marriages between young girls and older men are common in rural areas. In one case that caused a nationwide outcry, a wealthy Muslim cleric married a 12-year-old girl. He was prosecuted for sexually abusing a minor and sentenced to four years in jail.

Among the Aceh of Sumatra, girls formerly married before puberty. The husbands, though usually older, were still unfit for sexual union.

==== Malaysia ====

The current laws involving child marriage are very complex in Malaysia, primarily due to conflicts between the beliefs of the government and those disposed by the religious teachings of Islam.

A 41-year-old Malaysian man married an 11-year-old girl in Golok, a border town in southern Thailand, in June 2018, according to information made public in Malaysia. The man was the imam of a surau in a hamlet near Gua Musang, Kelantan, and he already had two wives and six children. The girl&#x27;s parents defended their choice to consent to the marriage.

In response to this incident, Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Wan Azizah Wan Ismail said that the marriage remained valid under Islam. She also said in a press statement that &quot;the Malaysian government &#x27;unequivocally&#x27; opposes child marriages and is already taking steps to raise the minimum age of marriage to 18&quot;.

Minister in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Department, Datuk Mujahid Yusof Rawa, proposed a blanket ban on marriages involving minors. In response, PAS Vice President Datuk Mohd Amar Nik Abdullah said that imposing a blanket ban on child marriage contradicts Islamic religious teachings and could not be accepted. He also said it would be better to enforce existing laws to protect children from being forced into early marriages.

In July 2018, another case of a child bride was reported in Malaysia, involving a 19-year-old man from Terengganu and a 13-year-old girl from Kelantan.

In August 2018, Selangor announced plans for an amendment to the Islamic Family Law (State of Selangor) Enactment 2003 which would raise the minimum age of marriage for Muslim women from 16 to 18 years.

Another child marriage case was covered by the media in September 2018.

Malaysia planned to tighten the requirements for child marriages in 2019. Subsequently, any marriage with minors would have to go through a stringent approval process involving Shariah Court Department, the Home Ministry, State Religious Council, and Customary Courts.

==== Philippines ====
In December 2021, President Rodrigo Duterte signed a law criminalizing child marriage, including its facilitation and solemnization, and cohabitation of an adult with a child outside wedlock.

Before the law change, the legal age for marriage was 18 for most Filipinos; however, Muslim Filipino boys were able to marry from age 15, and Muslim girls from puberty.

According to UNICEF, 15% of Filipino girls were married before age 18, and 2% were married by age 15, mostly in the Muslim-dominated Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao region

====Bangladesh====
Child marriage rates in Bangladesh are amongst the highest in the world. Every 2 out of 3 marriages involve child marriages. According to statistics from 2005, 49% of women then between 25 and 29 were married by the age of 15 in Bangladesh. According to a 2008 study, for each additional year a girl in rural Bangladesh is not married she will attend school an additional 0.22 years on average. The later girls were married, the more likely they were to utilize preventive health care. Married girls in the region were found to have less influence on family planning, higher rates of maternal mortality, and lower status in their husband&#x27;s family than girls who married later. Another study found that women who married at age 18 or older were less likely to experience IPV (intimate partner violence) than those married before age 18. It also found that girls married before age 15 were at an even higher risk for IPV.

====India====
According to UNICEF&#x27;s &quot;State of the World&#x27;s Children-2009&quot; report, 47% of India&#x27;s women aged 20–24 married before the legal age of 18, with 56% marrying before age 18 in rural areas. The report also showed that 40% of the world&#x27;s child marriages occur in India. As with Africa, this UNICEF report is based on data that is derived from a small sample survey in 1999. The latest available UNICEF report for India uses 2004–2005 household survey data, on a small sample, and other scholars report lower incidence rates for India. According to Raj et al., the 2005 small sample household survey data suggests 22% of girls ever married aged 16–18, 20% of girls in India married between 13 and 16, and 2.6% married before age 13. According to 2011 nationwide census of India, the average age of marriage for women in India is 21. The child marriage rates in India, according to a 2009 representative survey, dropped to 7%. In its 2001 demographic report, the Census of India stated zero married girls below age 10, 1.4 million married girls out of 59.2 million girls in the age 10–14, and 11.3 million married girls out of 46.3 million girls in the age 15–19 (which includes 18–19 age group). For 2011, the Census of India reports child marriage rates dropping further to 3.7% of females aged less than 18 being married.

The Child Marriage Restraint Act 1929 was passed during the tenure of British rule on Colonial India. It forbade the marriage of a male younger than 21 or a female younger than 18 for Hindus, Buddhists, Christians, and most people of India. However, this law did not and currently does not apply to India&#x27;s 165 million Muslim population, and only applies to India&#x27;s Hindu, Christian, Jain, Sikh, and other religious minorities. This link of law and religion was formalized by the British colonial rule with the Muslim personal laws codified in the Indian Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act of 1937. The age at which India&#x27;s Muslim girls can legally marry, according to this Muslim Personal Law, is 9, and can be lower if her guardian (&quot;wali&quot;) decides she is sexually mature. Over the last 25 years, All India Muslim Personal Law Board and other Muslim civil organizations have actively opposed India-wide laws and enforcement action against child marriages; they have argued that Indian Muslim families have a religious right to marry a girl aged 15 or even 12. Several states of India claim specially high child marriage rates in their Muslim and tribal communities. India, with a population of over 1.2 billion, has the world&#x27;s highest total number of child marriages. It is a significant social issue. As of 2016, the situation has been legally rectified by The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006.

According to the &quot;National Plan of Action for Children 2005&quot;, published by Indian government&#x27;s Department of Women and Child Development, set a goal to eliminate child marriage completely by 2010. In 2006, The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 was passed to prohibit solemnization of child marriages. This law states that men must be at least 21 years of age and women must be at least 18 years of age to marry.

Some Muslim organizations planned to challenge the new law in the Supreme Court of India. In latter years, various high courts in India – including the Gujarat High Court, the Karnataka High Court and the Madras High Court – have ruled that the act prevails over any personal law (including Muslim personal law).

====Nepal====

UNICEF reported that 28.8% of marriages in Nepal were child marriages as of 2011. A UNICEF discussion paper determined that 79.6 percent of Muslim girls in Nepal, 69.7 percent of girls living in hilly regions irrespective of religion, and 55.7 percent of girls living in other rural areas, are all married before the age of 15. Girls born into the highest wealth quintile marry about two years later than those from the other quintiles.

====Pakistan====

According to a UNICEF report from 2018, around 18% of the girls in Pakistan were married before the age of 18 and 4% of the girls were married before the age of 15. In the past two 2013 reports suggest that over 50% of all marriages in Pakistan involve girls less than 18 years old.

The exact number of child marriages in Pakistan below the age of 13 is unknown, but rising according to the United Nations.

Another custom in Pakistan, called &quot;swara&quot; or &quot;vani&quot;, involves village elders solving family disputes or settling unpaid debts by marrying off girls. The average marriage age of &quot;swara&quot; girls is between 5 and 9. Similarly, the custom of watta satta has been cited as a cause of child marriages in Pakistan.

According to Population Council, 35% of all females in Pakistan become mothers before they reach the age of 18, and 67% have experienced pregnancy – 69% of these have given birth – before they reach the age of 19. Less than 4% of married girls below the age of 19 had some say in choosing her spouse; over 80% were married to a near or distant relative. Child marriage and early motherhood is common in Pakistan.

====Iran====
In Iran, as in other developing societies, the phenomenon of child marriage, or early child marriage, is widespread. According to the official statistics of Iran in 2013, as many as 187,000 marriages of children under the legal age were registered with the country&#x27;s Civil Registration Organization. The vice president of prevention of social harms of the government&#x27;s welfare organization stated that, in 2016, 17% of girls’ marriages in Iran took place before they reached the age of 18. The border provinces of Khorasan Razavi, East Azerbaijan, and Sistan and Baluchistan are the three provinces where the highest number of child marriages occur.

Though the legal age of marriage in Iran is 13 years for girls and 15 for boys, there are cases of girls below the age of 10 being married. The same source pointed out that &quot;child marriages are more common in socially backward rural areas often afflicted with high levels of illiteracy and drug addiction&quot;. In October 2019, a prosecutor annulled the marriage of an 11-year-old girl to her adult cousin in rural Iran, and said he was indicting the mullah (officiant) and the girl&#x27;s parents for an illegal underage marriage. According to the Iranian Students News Agency, nearly 6,000 children are married each year in Iran.

The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC) examining child marriage in Iran has warned of a rising number of young girls forced into marriage in Iran. The Committee deplored the fact that the State party allows sexual intercourse involving girls as young as 9 lunar years and that other forms of sexual abuse of even younger children is not criminalized.
CRC said that Tehran must &quot;repeal all provisions that authorize, condone or lead to child sexual abuse&quot; and called for the age of sexual consent to be increased from nine years old to 16. The Society For Protecting The Rights of The Child said that 43,459 girls aged under 15 married in 2009. In 2010, 716 girls under the age of 10 married, up from 449 in the year prior. On 8 March 2018 a member of the Tehran City Council, Shahrbanoo Amani said that there were 15,000 widows under the age of 15 in the country.

The Iranian Government has been criticized by the international community over its high rate of child marriage.

In August 2019, Iran demonstrated its sensitivity towards its birth rates by arresting Kameel Ahmady, an expert in the area of child marriage, and sentencing him to a nine-year and three-month imprisonment for alleged &quot;subversive research.&quot; Ahmady&#x27;s research focuses on harmful traditional practices such as early child marriage, female genital mutilation (FGM), sexuality and the LGBTQ+ community, child labour and ethnic issues. His group fieldwork research on child marriage, carried out in 2017 and published under the title An Echo of Silence: A Comprehensive Research Study on Early Child Marriage (ECM) in Iran, brought him to the attention of the authorities because they believed he was campaigning to raise the legal age of marriage for girls.

==== Yemen ====
Child marriage is a common practice in Yemen, both in urban and rural areas. As of 2023, an estimated 3.8 million Yemeni girls (about 30%) are married before the age of 18, with approximately 1.3 million girls (about 7%) married before the age of 15.

According to Human Rights Watch (HRW), in 1999 the minimum marriage age 15 for women was abolished; the onset of puberty, interpreted by conservatives to be at age nine, was set as a requirement for consummation of marriage. In April 2008, Nujood Ali, a 10-year-old girl, successfully obtained a divorce after being raped under these conditions. Her case prompted calls to raise the legal age for marriage to 18. Later in 2008, the Supreme Council for Motherhood and Childhood proposed to define the minimum age for marriage at 18 years, the law passed in April 2009 with the age voted for as 17, however due to maneuvers by opposing parliamentarians the law was dropped the next day.

Since 2014 the Yemeni civil war has led to severe disruption of economic, social and political systems. Extreme poverty drives many families in Yemen to marry off their daughters for financial relief, receiving a dowry in exchange, or sometimes to ensure the safety of girls in an unstable environment. Limited access to education leaves young girls with limited options, as child marriage rates are significantly higher among uneducated girls (39.5%) compared to those with secondary education (22.3%). Houthi laws and policies have also forced the closure of several civil and human rights organisations and also further restricted access to education, indirectly increasing child marriage rates.

===Europe===

====General====
Each European country has its own laws; in both the European Union and the Council of Europe the marriageable age falls within the jurisdiction of individual member states. The Istanbul convention, the first legally binding instrument in Europe in the field of violence against women and domestic violence, only requires countries which ratify it to prohibit forced marriage (Article 37) and to ensure that forced marriages can be easily voided without further victimization (Article 32), but does not make any reference to a minimum age of marriage.

====European Union====
In the European Union, the general age of marriage &quot;as a right&quot; is 18 in all member states. When all exceptions are taken into account (such as judicial or parental consent), the minimum age is 16 in most countries, and in Estonia, it is 15. In 6 countries marriage under 18 is completely prohibited. By contrast, in 6 countries there is no set minimum age, although all these countries require the authorization of a public authority (such as a judge or social worker) for the marriage to take place.

====Scandinavia====
In April 2016, Reuters reported &quot;Child brides sometimes tolerated in Nordic asylum centers despite bans&quot;. For example, at least 70 girls under 18 were living as married couples in Sweden; in Norway, &quot;some&quot; under 16 lived &quot;with their partners&quot;. In Denmark, it was determined there were &quot;dozens of cases of girls living with older men&quot;, prompting Minister Inger Stojberg to state she would &quot;stop housing child brides in asylum centers&quot;.

Marriage under 18 was completely banned in Sweden in 2014, in Denmark in 2017, and in Finland in 2019.

====Balkans/Eastern Europe====
In these areas, child and forced marriages are associated with the Roma community and with some rural populations. However, such marriages are illegal in most of the countries from that area. In recent years, many of those countries have taken steps in order to curb these practices, including equalizing the marriageable age of both sexes (e.g. Romania in 2007, Ukraine in 2012). Therefore, most of those &#x27;marriages&#x27; are informal unions (without legal recognition) and often arranged from very young ages. Such practices are common in Serbia, Bulgaria and Romania (in these countries the marriageable age is 18, and can only be lowered to 16 in special circumstances with judicial approval). A 2003 case involving the daughter of an informal &#x27;gypsy king&#x27; of the area has made international news.

====Belgium====
&quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported in April 2016 that &quot;17 child brides&quot; arrived in Belgium in 2015 and a further 7 so far in 2016. The same report added that &quot;Between 2010 and 2013, the police registered at least 56 complaints about a forced marriage.&quot;

==== Germany ====
In 2016 there were 1475 underage foreigners in Germany registered as married, of which 1100 were girls. Syrians represented 664, Afghans 157 and Iraqis 100. In July 2016, 361 foreign children under 14 were registered as married.

====Netherlands====
The Dutch government&#x27;s National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings and Sexual Violence against Children wrote that &quot;between September 2015 and January 2016 around 60 child brides entered the Netherlands&quot;. At least one was 14 years old. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that asylum centers in the Netherlands were &quot;housing 20 child brides between ages 13 and 15&quot; in 2015.

====Russia====
The common marriageable age established by the Family Code of Russia is 18 years old. Marriages of persons at age from 16 to 18 years are allowed only with good reasons and by local municipal authority permission. Marriage before 16 years old may be allowed by federal subject of Russia law as an exception just in special circumstances.

By 2016, a minimum age for marriage in special circumstances had been established at 14 years (in Adygea, Kaluga Oblast, Magadan Oblast, Moscow Oblast, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, Novgorod Oblast, Oryol Oblast, Sakhalin Oblast, Tambov Oblast, Tatarstan, Vologda Oblast) or to 15 years (in Murmansk Oblast and Ryazan Oblast). Others subjects of Russia also can have marriageable age laws.

Abatement of marriageable age is an ultimate measure acceptable in cases of life threat, pregnancy, and childbirth.

====United Kingdom====
Since May 1, 2022, the marriageable age in both England and Wales is 18 with no exemptions (16 with consent of both parents or guardians, plus also a magistrate approval required within Northern Ireland only), although in Scotland no parental consent is required over 16. Scotland and Andorra are the only European jurisdictions where 16-year-olds can marry as &quot;a right&quot; (i.e. without parental or court approval); see .

According to a 2004 report in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, girls as young as 12 have been smuggled into the UK to be the brides of men in the Muslim community. Girls trying to escape this child marriage can face death because this breaks the honor code of her husband and both families.

As with the United States, underage cohabitation is observed in the United Kingdom. According to a 2005 study, 4.1% of all girls in the 15–19 age group in the UK were cohabiting (living in an informal union), while 8.9% of all girls in that age group admitted to having been in a cohabitation relation (child marriage per UNICEF definition), before the age of 18. Over 4% of all underage girls in the UK were teenage mothers.

In July 2014, the United Kingdom hosted its first global Girl Summit; the goal of the Summit was to increase efforts to end child, early, and forced marriage, as well as female genital mutilation within a generation.

==Consequences==
Child marriage has consequences that last well beyond adolescence. Women married as children struggle with the impact of pregnancy at a young age on the body, often with little spacing between children. Early marriages followed by teen pregnancy also significantly increase birth complications and social isolation. In poor countries, early pregnancy limits or can even eliminate a woman&#x27;s education options, affecting her economic independence. Girls in child marriages are more likely to suffer from domestic violence, child sexual abuse, and marital rape.

===Health===
Child marriage threatens the health and life of girls. Complications from pregnancy and childbirth are the main cause of death among adolescent girls below age 19 in developing countries. Girls aged 15 to 19 are twice as likely to die in childbirth as fully-grown women in their 20s, and girls under the age of 15 are five to seven times more likely to die during childbirth. These consequences are due largely to girls&#x27; physical immaturity wherefore the pelvis and birth canal are not fully developed. Teen pregnancy, particularly below age 15, increases risk of developing an obstetric fistula, since their smaller pelvises make them prone to obstructed labor. Girls who give birth before the age of 15 have an 88% risk of developing a fistula, and those between 18 and 15 have a 25% chance. Fistulas can cause urine or fecal incontinence that causes lifelong complications with infection and pain. Unless surgically repaired, obstetric fistulas can cause years of permanent disability and shame to mothers, and can result in being shunned by the community. Married girls also have a higher risk of sexually transmitted infections, cervical cancer, and malaria than non-married peers or girls who marry in their 20s.

Child marriage also threatens the lives of offspring. Mothers under the age of 18 years have 35 to 55% increased risk of delivering pre-term or having a low birth weight baby than a mother who is 19 or 20 years old. In addition, infant mortality rates are 60% higher when the mother is under 18 years old. Infants born to child mothers tend to have weaker immune systems and face a heightened risk of malnutrition.

Prevalence of child marriage may also be associated with higher rates of population growth, more cases of children left orphaned, and the accelerated spread of disease which for many translates into prolonged poverty.

===Illiteracy and poverty===
Child marriage often ends a girl&#x27;s education, particularly in impoverished countries where child marriages are common. In addition, uneducated girls are more at risk for child marriage. Girls who have only a primary education are twice as likely to marry before age 18 than those with a secondary or higher education, and girls with no education are three times more likely to marry before age 18 than those with a secondary education. Early marriage impedes a young girl&#x27;s ability to continue with her education as most drop out of school following marriage to focus their attention on domestic duties and having or raising children. Girls may be taken out of school years before they are married due to family or community beliefs that allocating resources for girls&#x27; education is unnecessary given that her primary roles will be that of wife and mother. Without education, girls and adult women have fewer opportunities to earn an income and financially provide for themselves and their children. This makes girls more vulnerable to persistent poverty if their spouses die, abandon them, or divorce them. Given that girls in child marriages are often significantly younger than their husbands, they become widowed earlier in life and may face associated economic and social challenges for a greater portion of their life than women who marry later.

===Domestic violence===
Married teenage girls with low levels of education suffer greater risk of social isolation and domestic violence than more educated women who marry as adults. Following marriage, girls frequently relocate to their husband&#x27;s home and take on the domestic role of being a wife, which often involves relocating to another village or area. This transition may result in a young girl dropping out of school, moving away from her family and friends, and a loss of the social support that she once had. A husband&#x27;s family may also have higher expectations for the girl&#x27;s submissiveness to her husband and his family because of her youth. This sense of isolation from a support system can have severe mental health implications including depression.

Large age gaps between the child and her spouse make her more vulnerable to domestic violence and marital rape. Girls who marry as children face severe and life-threatening marital violence at higher rates. Husbands in child marriages are often more than ten years older than their wives. This can increase the power and control a husband has over his wife and contribute to prevalence of spousal violence. Early marriage places young girls in a vulnerable situation of being completely dependent on her husband. Domestic and sexual violence from their husbands has lifelong, devastating mental health consequences for young girls because they are at a formative stage of psychological development. These mental health consequences of spousal violence can include depression and suicidal thoughts. Child brides, particularly in situations such as vani, also face social isolation, emotional abuse and discrimination in the homes of their husbands and in-laws.

===Women&#x27;s rights===
The United Nations, through a series of conventions has declared child marriage a violation of human rights. The Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination of Women (CEDAW), the Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC), and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights form the international standard against child marriage. Child marriages impact violates a range of women&#x27;s interconnected rights such as equality on grounds of sex and age, to receive the highest attainable standard of health, to be free from slavery, access to education, freedom of movement, freedom from violence, reproductive rights, and the right to consensual marriage. The consequence of these violations impact woman, her children, and the broader society.

=== Development ===
High rates of child marriage negatively impact countries&#x27; economic development because of early marriages&#x27; impact on girls&#x27; education and labor market participation. Some researchers and activists note that high rates of child marriage prevent significant progress toward each of the eight Millennium Development Goals and global efforts to reduce poverty due to its effects on educational attainment, economic and political participation, and health.

A UNICEF Nepal issued report noted that child marriage impacts Nepal&#x27;s development due to loss of productivity, poverty, and health effects. Using Nepal Multi-Indicator Survey data, its researchers estimate that all girls delaying marriage until age 20 and after would increase cash flow among Nepali women in an amount equal to 3.87% of the country&#x27;s GDP. Their estimates considered decreased education and employment among girls in child marriages in addition to low rates of education and high rates of poverty among children from child marriages.

== Prevention ==

Child marriage is always forced marriage, according to the OHCHR, because children cannot give full informed consent to marriage. Many organizations offer ways to help prevent child marriage and forced marriage.

=== For children ===

Child marriage is illegal in many places; however, children who have been forced into marriage have not broken the law. There are organizations that offer help, such as housing and legal aid, to children who are trying to escape or prevent a marriage.

==== In the United States ====
A child who has been forced into a marriage has not broken any laws in the United States and is not at fault. The US government is opposed to child marriage, and offers legal help and social services to children who have been forced to marry. Children in the United States who need to prevent or leave a forced marriage can call the National Domestic Violence Hotline.

Within the United States, each state and territory and the federal district set the marriage age in its jurisdiction. , in four states there is no statutory minimum age when all exemptions are taken into account. These states are California, Mississippi, New Mexico, and Oklahoma.

, 13 states have banned underage marriages, with no exception: Delaware (2018), New Jersey (2018), Pennsylvania (2020), Minnesota (2020), Rhode Island (2021), New York (2021), Massachusetts (2022), Vermont (2023), Connecticut (2023), Michigan (2023), Washington (2024), Virginia (2024) and New Hampshire (2024). American Samoa, U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico, all United States territories, have also ended child marriage in that time. Several other U.S. states have similar legislation pending.

==== In Europe ====

In the United Kingdom, when anything is done to make someone marry before they turn 18 the government of the UK considers this to be a forced marriage, which is unlawful. The Forced Marriage Unit offers help to children facing it.

In the Netherlands, the minimum age to marry is 18. Forcing someone to marry is unlawful, even if the marriage took place outside the Netherlands. Children who have been forced to marry may contact National Expertise Centre on Forced Marriage and Abandonment for help.

==== In Africa ====
In June 2024, the Sierra Leone Parliament passed the Prohibition of Child Marriage Bill 2024, which makes marrying or cohabitating with anyone under 18 years old illegal, with a punishment of 15 years in prison or a large fine. The bill was signed into law in July 2024.

===International initiatives===

In December 2011 a resolution adopted by the United Nations General Assembly (A/RES/66/170) designated 11 October as the &quot;International Day of the Girl Child&quot;. On 11 October 2012 the first &quot;International Day of the Girl Child&quot; was held, the theme of which was ending child marriage.

In 2013 the first United Nations Human Rights Council resolution against child, early, and forced marriages was adopted; it recognizes child marriage as a human rights violation and pledges to eliminate the practice as part of the UN&#x27;s post-2015 global development agenda.

In 2014 the UN&#x27;s Commission on the Status of Women issued a document in which they agreed, among other things, to eliminate child marriage.

The World Health Organization recommends increased educational attainment among girls, increased enforcement structures for existing minimum marriage age laws, and informing parents in practicing communities of the risks associated as primary methods to prevent child marriages.

Programs to prevent child marriage have taken several different approaches. Various initiatives have aimed to empower young girls, educate parents on the associated risks, change community perceptions, support girls&#x27; education, and provide economic opportunities for girls and their families through means other than marriage. A survey of a variety of prevention programs found that initiatives were most effect when they combined efforts to address financial constraints, education, and limited employment of women.

Girls in families participating in an unconditional cash transfer program in Malawi aimed at incentivizing girls&#x27; education married and had children later than their peers who had not participated in the program. The program&#x27;s effects on rates of child marriage were greater for unconditional cast transfer programs than those with conditions. Evaluators believe this demonstrated that the economic needs of the family heavily influenced the appeal of child marriage in this community. Therefore, reducing financial pressures on the family decreased the economic motivations to marry daughters off at a young age.

The Haryana state government in India operated a program in which poor families were given a financial incentive if they kept their daughters in school and unmarried until age 18. Girls in families who were eligible for the program were less likely to be married before age 18 than their peers.

A similar program was operated in 2004 by the Population Council and the regional government in Ethiopia&#x27;s rural Amhara Region. Families received cash if their daughters remained in school and unmarried during the two years of the program. They also instituted mentorship programs, livelihood training, community conversations about girls&#x27; education and child marriage, and gave school supplies for girls. After the two-year program, girls in families eligible for the program were three times more likely to be in school and one tenth as likely to be married compared to their peers.

The Global Campaign for the Prevention of Child Marriage (GCPCM) was launched in March 2019. Its primary goal is raising awareness and addressing child marriage in the world. 
Other programs have addressed child marriage less directly through a variety of programming related to girls&#x27; empowerment, education, sexual and reproductive health, financial literacy, life skills, communication skills, and community mobilization.

In 2018, UN Women announced that Jaha Dukureh would serve as Goodwill Ambassador in Africa to help organize to prevent child marriage.

==== Tipping point analysis ====
Researchers at the International Center for Research on Women found that in some communities rates of child marriage increase significantly when girls are a particular age. This &quot;tipping point&quot;, or age at which rates of marriage increase dramatically, may occur years before the median age of marriage. Therefore, the researchers argue prevention programs should focus their programming on girls who are pre-tipping point age rather than only on girls who are married before they reach the median age for marriage.

<text>The Sandman is the pseudonym of several fictional characters appearing in comic books published by DC Comics. They have appeared in stories of various genres, including the pulp detective character Wesley Dodds, superheroes such as Garrett Sanford and Hector Hall, and mythic fantasy characters more commonly called by the name Dream. Named after the folklore character that is said to bring pleasant dreams to children, each has had some thematic connection to dreaming, and efforts have been made to tie them into a common continuity within the DC Universe.

==Fictional character biographies==
===Wesley Dodds===

Wesley Dodds is the first DC Comics fictional character to bear the name of the Sandman. Attired in a green business suit, fedora, and gas mask, the Sandman uses a gun emitting a sleeping gas to sedate criminals. He starts out as a &quot;mystery man&quot;, but eventually develops into a more standard superhero, becoming a founder of the Justice Society of America. He later uses sand and a blowtorch that he could use to quickly create walls, and wears a purple and gold costume. He would later pick up a sidekick, Sandy the Golden Boy. The Sandman appeared in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #40 (July 1939) through #102 (February 1946).

===Garrett Sanford===

The Sandman of the 1970s was created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby. Issue #1 was intended as a one-shot, but five more issues and an additional story followed. After the first issue, the stories were written by Michael Fleisher. The second and third issues were illustrated by Ernie Chua. Inks were by Kirby, Mike Royer and, in the sixth issue, Wally Wood. All covers were by Kirby, and the fourth issue noted his return to the interior artwork on the cover.

This Sandman was originally intended to be the Sandman of popular myth, &quot;eternal and immortal&quot;, despite his superhero-like appearance and adventures. The Sandman is assisted by two living nightmares named Brute and Glob, whom he releases from domed cells with the help of a magic whistle. They are nuisances who beg for release, who are intent on hand-to-hand combat, but are implied to be relatively harmless and well-intentioned once freed. Using security monitoring devices, the Sandman can enter the &quot;Dream Stream&quot; or the &quot;Reality Stream&quot; (in which he acts like the superhero he looks like), and he carries a pouch of dream dust with which he can cause anyone to sleep and dream. The Sandman&#x27;s main task is protecting children from nightmare monsters within their dreams, especially one young boy named Jed Walker, who lives with his grandfather Ezra Paulsen as well as to ensure that children have an appropriate level of nightmares rather than dealing with such anxieties in real life.

Implied to be a major foe of his is the Nightmare Wizard, who creates nightmares that are too extreme and sometimes kill children who dream them. In none of his three appearances does the Nightmare Wizard serve as an antagonist, but the two are clearly opposed to each other.

In the final Fleischer-Kirby-created adventure (intended for &quot;The Sandman&quot; #7 but published in &quot;The Best of DC&quot; #22) he even assists the legendary Santa Claus against a menacing band of Seal Men who are angry about being sent the wrong gifts during the previous Christmas.

This version of the Sandman only appeared for a handful of issues and was generally unused for years thereafter. In a retcon by Roy Thomas, appearing in &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; #300 (Feb. 1983), the Sandman is revealed to be Dr. Garrett Sanford, a UCLA psychology professor who became trapped in the Dream Dimension while saving the life of a great man (there are hints that it is a U.S. President), who was in a coma while being terrorized by a powerful nightmare monster. This issue, and the following appearance, note for the first time that his appearances outside the Dream Dimension were strictly limited to one hour, because physically entering the Dream Dimension was a one-way process, so others could send him equipment, but he could not be brought out. Despite this, Sanford nevertheless tries to romance Diana in spite of her acceptance of Steve Trevor&#x27;s proposal of marriage. The issue also introduced Hippolyta Trevor (daughter of the Earth-Two counterparts of Diana and Steve Trevor), who would later be married to Sanford&#x27;s successor, Hector Hall, and a major character in the Vertigo series as mother of Daniel Hall.

The Sandman also becomes an honorary member of the Justice League in &quot;Justice League of America Annual&quot; #1 (1983) (written by Paul Levitz and Len Wein), in which they fought Doctor Destiny, who had trapped Sanford in a tube like those used for Brute and Glob, and eventually the Justice League as well. Sanford declined a full membership because he cannot leave the Dream Dimension for more than an hour at a time.

The latter two appearances, and the subsequent uses of the costume, featured a red hourglass on the front of the suit that did not appear in the Kirby (or Chua) art.

Letters pages in the original series often complained of the series being too juvenile, while &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; #300 makes references to sexual dreams and has Sanford admit to observing Diana&#x27;s dreams inappropriately.

Sandman, Jed, Brute, and Glob, observed by Metron, appeared in one panel of &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; #62, Rick Veitch&#x27;s first writing on the series.

In &quot;Infinity Inc.&quot; #50 (May 1988), it is revealed that Sanford had since gone insane due to the loneliness of the Dream Dimension and committed suicide.

In 2016, DC Comics implemented another relaunch of its books called &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; which restored its continuity to a form much as it was prior to &quot;The New 52&quot;. Garrett Sanford has been operating in the Dreaming as Sandman for a long time while being served by Brute and Glob. Unlike the Pre-Crisis version, this version of Garrett Sanford wields an Orichalchum Whistle that enables him to leave the Dreaming. Sandman appeared to help Forager after falling into a trap by General Electric wielding a copy of the Orichalcum Whistle. General Electric&#x27;s plot was thwarted when Forager traveled back in time and caused a paradox.

===Hector Hall===

In &quot;Infinity Inc.&quot; #50 (May 1988), Hector Hall (formerly the Silver Scarab and son of Carter Hall) has now supplanted the deceased Sanford as the Sandman, and was, in fact, using Sanford&#x27;s body after his own was taken by the second Silver Scarab. Hector becoming Sandman was caused by Brute and Glob.

In &quot;The Sandman&quot; vol. 2 #12 (1990), it is further revealed that the Dream Dimension was, in fact, a small universe in the mind of Jed Walker which was created by Brute and Glob (who were explained as being two former servants of Dream that had escaped his realm during the Lord of Dream&#x27;s long absence). It turns out that Hall has actually died some years before, and that his incarnation as the Sandman is merely a shell that Dream sucks into another part of the Dreaming when he defeats the two creatures.

Hall goes on to be reincarnated as Doctor Fate. His only appearances as The Sandman are in &quot;Infinity Inc.&quot; #49–51, &quot;The Sandman&quot; vol. 2, #11–12 and &quot;The Sandman Presents: The Thessaliad&quot; #2.

Ambush Bug briefly wore the Sanford/Hall costume in &quot;Ambush Bug Nothing Special&quot; #1 in an attempt to become sidekick to Dream.

This Sandman likeness appeared, along with Brute and Glob, in &quot;JSA&quot; #63–64. This time, the costume was worn by Sandy Hawkins. Daniel Hall recaptured Brute and Glob and again retired the Kirby Sandman design.

===Dream===

Dream, also known as Morpheus, is one of seven archetypal beings referred to as the Endless who embody various aspects of existence. He is the main character of the second &quot;Sandman&quot; series, written by Neil Gaiman. Dream is the personification of dreams, storytelling and—because the Endless also represent the opposite of that which they personify—reality. Gaiman&#x27;s Dream more closely resembles the concept of the Sandman as he is portrayed in mythology than a traditional superhero genre character. In the course of Gaiman&#x27;s story arcs, it is retconned that the other DC Sandman characters were in various ways derived from Morpheus or his activities. For instance, Wesley Dodds&#x27; prophetic dreams warning him of crimes and disasters are explained as an attempt by reality to fill the void left by Dream&#x27;s absence from his realm during most of the 20th century, while the Kirby version of the Sandman is the result of two nightmares trying to manipulate a human being into fulfilling that same role in the hopes that they would be able to control the new incarnation of Dream.

===Daniel Hall===

Daniel Hall, the child of Hector Hall, eventually assumes the position of Dream when Morpheus dies. He, like Morpheus, is the embodiment of dreams, storytelling and reality. He refers to himself as simply &quot;Dream of the Endless&quot;; in &quot;The Wake&quot; he states that he has no right to the name of &quot;Morpheus&quot;, and that the part of him which was the mortal boy Daniel Hall no longer exists.

===Sandy Hawkins===

Some time later in the pages of &quot;JSA&quot; 63–64, the chairman and heir to the Sandman legacy Sand has his soul stolen by Brute and Glob to briefly assume the role of the Dream Dimension&#x27;s protector, again in the Kirby-designed costume. Eventually, Dr Fate (Hector Hall) and his wife Lyta lead a contingent of the JSA to Sand&#x27;s rescue. Brute and Glob are abjured to parts known only as &quot;The Darkness&quot;. This fragment of the Dream Dimension is currently not known to be inhabited.

Subsequently, Sand officially adopted the Sandman name and a costume patterned after Wesley Dodds in the third volume of &quot;Justice Society of America&quot;.

===Kieran Marshall===
In the &quot;Sandman Mystery Theatre: Sleep of Reason&quot; mini-series, photojournalist Kieran Marshall briefly takes on the identity of the Sandman to battle insurgents in Afghanistan, inspired by a visit Wesley Dodds made to the region shortly before his death.

<text>Ruth Plumly Thompson (27 July 1891 – 6 April 1976) was an American writer of children&#x27;s stories, best known for writing many novels placed in Oz, the fictional land of L. Frank Baum&#x27;s classic children&#x27;s novel &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; and its sequels.

==Life and work==
An avid reader of Baum&#x27;s books and a lifelong children&#x27;s writer, Thompson was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. While in high school she sold her first fairy tale to &quot;St. Nicholas Magazine&quot; to which she continued contributing, along with &quot;The Smart Set&quot;. In 1914 she took a job with the Philadelphia &quot;Public Ledger&quot;, writing a weekly children&#x27;s column for the newspaper. She had already published her first children&#x27;s book, &quot;The Perhappsy Chaps&quot;, and her second, &quot;The Princess of Cozytown&quot;, was pending publication when William Lee, vice president of Baum&#x27;s publisher Reilly &amp; Lee, solicited Thompson to continue the Oz series. (Rumors among fans that Thompson was Baum&#x27;s niece were untrue.)

===Writing Oz===
Her first Oz book, 1921&#x27;s &quot;The Royal Book of Oz&quot;, concerned the Scarecrow&#x27;s discovery that he was once the Emperor of the Silver Isles. To smooth the transition between Baum&#x27;s books and Thompson&#x27;s, Reilly &amp; Lee published the book under Baum&#x27;s name and claimed that the book was written from Baum&#x27;s notes, although this has been disproven.

Between 1921 and 1939, Thompson wrote one Oz book a year. (Since Thompson was the primary supporter of her widowed mother and disabled sister, the annual income from the Oz books was important for her financial circumstances.)

Thompson returned to Oz during her final years in the 1970s with her last two books being published by The International Wizard of Oz Club: &quot;Yankee in Oz&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Enchanted Island of Oz&quot; (1976); the latter was not originally written as an Oz book.

In 1965, Thompson remarked that writing the books &quot;has been an enchanting and wonderful experience, and the children and I have had tremendous fun together.&quot;

====Reception to Thompson&#x27;s Oz====
Thompson&#x27;s contributions to the Oz series are lively and imaginative, featuring a wide range of colorful and unusual characters. She emphasized humor to a greater extent than Baum did and more specifically targeted children as her primary audience. Scholar Russel B. Nye noted that Thompson&#x27;s books are &quot;a truer world of fun and fantasy, and a less complex one&quot; than Baum&#x27;s. In the 1983 &quot;Dictionary of Literary Biography&quot;, Michael Patrick Hearn wrote, &quot;While her books may lack the philosophical and imaginative depth of Baum&#x27;s best stories, Thompson&#x27;s tales nevertheless consistently possess a zest, a vitality noticeably wanting in Baum&#x27;s more somber interludes in his Oz books.&quot;

Illustrator John R. Neill wrote her on completing the illustrations for &quot;Kabumpo in Oz&quot;, &quot;Incidentally, I would like to tell you how much I enjoyed reading the [manuscript] and making the pictures. After illustrating about seventeen Oz books, I think it worthwhile to let you know this with my congratulations on having secured an author of such superior qualifications to continue the work of supplying the &#x27;Oz books.&#x27; Every feature of the child appeal is handled with the greatest skill. The whimsical, the humor, the interest and the zip of the book make me think it one of the very best Oz books so far.&quot;

===Post Oz===
After a falling out with Reilly &amp; Lee in the 1930s, Thompson wrote articles, stories, and poems for various publications including &quot;Jack and Jill&quot;, &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; and &quot;Ladies Home Journal&quot;.

In addition she was the initial editor of &quot;Ace Comics&quot;, &quot;King Comics&quot; and later became also editor of &quot;Magic Comics&quot;, all for David McKay Publications. In some cases she used the pen name Jo King. Her friend Marge provided illustrations for many of the pieces she contributed. From 1965 to 1970 she did the Perky Puppet page for &quot;Jack and Jill&quot; .

<doc id="411391" wikidata="Q2868259" url="?curid=411391" title="Succession planting">
<text>In agriculture, succession planting refers to several planting methods that increase crop availability during a growing season by making efficient use of space and timing.

There are four basic approaches, that can also be combined:

*Two or more crops in succession: On the same field where one crop has just been harvested, another is planted. The duration of the growing season, the environment, and the choice of crop are important variables. A crop that prefers the chilly spring months can be followed by a crop that prefers the summer heat.
*Same crop, successive plantings: Several smaller plantings are made at timed intervals, rather than all at once. The plants mature at staggered dates, establishing a continuous harvest over an extended period. Lettuce and other salad greens are common crops for this approach. Within a small garden or home garden, this method is useful in circumventing the initial large yield from the crop and rather providing a steady, smaller yield that may be consumed in its entirety. This is also known as relay planting.
*Two or more crops simultaneously: Non-competing crops, often with different maturity dates, are planted together in various patterns. Intercropping is one pattern approach; companion planting is a related, complementary practice. This method is also known as Interplanting: The practice of growing two types of plants in the same space. Interplanting requires a certain amount of preplanning and knowledge of the maturity dates of different types of vegetables. It has been noted that successful interplanting and intensive gardening is done in raised beds within the planting areas. Planting two or more non-competing crops may raise issues with soil-borne diseases and insects that only affect one type of plant. Depending on how close the interplanting varieties are, crop failure is a possibility.
*Same crop, different maturity dates: Several varieties are selected, with different maturity dates: early, main season, late. Planted at the same time, the varieties mature one after the other over the season.

These techniques can be used to design complex, highly productive cropping systems. The more involved the plan, the more detailed knowledge is required of the specific varieties and how they perform in a particular growing location. A number of tertiary institutions have written about the advantages of succession planting and outlined extensive guides to this bio intensive style of small scale crop farming. There are a numerous differences in guides to succession planting due to the diverse climate and soil conditions experienced around the world. There are significant differences between cold weather succession planting and warm weather succession planting.

The term &quot;succession planting&quot; usually appears in literature for home gardening and small-scale farming, although the techniques apply to any scale. Some definitions include one or more, but not all of the four techniques described above.

Succession planting is often used in organic farming. Multiple cropping describes essentially the same general method. A catch crop refers to a specific type of succession planting, where a fast-growing crop is grown simultaneously with, or between successive plantings of, a main crop.

Succession planting has been touted as a way to minimize the risks of crop failure for small farmers. This includes the risk of adverse weather conditions, increased pest conditions and seed failure.

<text>John Rea Neill (November 12, 1877 – September 19, 1943) was a magazine and children&#x27;s book illustrator primarily known for illustrating more than forty stories set in the Land of Oz, including L. Frank Baum&#x27;s, Ruth Plumly Thompson&#x27;s, and three of his own. His pen-and-ink drawings have become identified almost exclusively with the Oz series. He did a great deal of magazine and newspaper illustration work which is not as well known today.

==Early life==
Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, John R. Neill did his first illustration work for the Philadelphia&#x27;s Central High School newspaper in 1894–95. Neill dropped out of Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts after one semester because he said, &quot;they have nothing to teach me&quot;.

He then turned to advertising art for the Wanamaker department store in Philadelphia. He became a staff artist of the &quot;Philadelphia North American&quot; newspaper, for which he produced features like the comics strip &quot;Toyland&quot;, illustrations for the serialization of &#x27;The Fate of a Crown&#x27; (a book by L. Frank Baum), &quot;Children&#x27;s Stories That Never Grow Old&quot;, and the Sunday comics page &#x27;The Little Journeys of Nip and Tuck&#x27; with verses by W.R. Bradford (1909–1910). He was first commissioned to illustrate &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot;, the second Oz book L. Frank Baum wrote, published in 1904; &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; had been illustrated by W. W. Denslow, with whom Baum argued and lost contact afterward.

==Career==
Originally, Neill&#x27;s illustrations were slightly reminiscent of Denslow&#x27;s to bring continuity and familiarity to the characters, although Neill&#x27;s work in this period was far more reminiscent of the work of his contemporary and friend, illustrator Joseph Clement Coll. Denslow&#x27;s illustrations had been quite popular. However, as the series expanded, Neill brought his own unique flair to the illustrations, showing more artistic representations of the characters as well as beautiful paintings of numerous scenes. In fact, he was later named the Imperial Illustrator of Oz.

Neill&#x27;s illustrations were published in the leading magazines of the first few decades of the twentieth century, including &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, &quot;The Ladies Home Journal&quot;, &quot;Century&quot;, &quot;Pictorial Review&quot;, &quot;The Delineator&quot;, &quot;Boys&#x27; Life&quot;, &quot;St. Nicholas&quot;, &quot;The People&#x27;s Home Journal&quot;, &quot;Adventure&quot; and many others. In 1930 and 1931, he contributed a great deal of artwork to &quot;Argosy&quot;.

==Dorothy==

Dorothy drawn by Denslow appeared to be a chubby five- or six-year-old with long brown hair in two thick braids that remained untied at the ends. Neill chose to illustrate a new Dorothy in 1907 when the character was reintroduced in &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot;. He illustrated the young girl in a more fashionable appearance. She is shown to be about ten years old, dressed in contemporary American fashions, with blonde hair cut in a fashionable bob. A similar modernization was given other female characters.

==Oz work==
Neill continued to illustrate the Oz books after Baum&#x27;s death, and his artwork was praised for helping give Ruth Plumly Thompson&#x27;s books &quot;legitimacy&quot; in the eyes of Baum&#x27;s fans. Neill would eventually succeed Thompson as the designated &quot;Oz historian&quot; and write several books himself.

&quot;The Wonder City of Oz&quot;, &quot;The Scalawagons of Oz&quot;, and &quot;Lucky Bucky in Oz&quot;, which debuted each year from 1940 to 1942, were written by Neill for the firm of Reilly &amp; Lee and are considered part of the &quot;Famous Forty&quot;. His last work, &quot;The Runaway in Oz&quot;, was drafted before his death, but the full illustrations were never finished and Reilly &amp; Lee decided not to publish the manuscript. However, Neill&#x27;s widow kept the manuscript safe, and, in 1995, it was finally published by Books of Wonder and edited and illustrated by Eric Shanower. The book&#x27;s design reproduces the design used throughout almost all of the Baum, Thompson, and Neill Oz books (without the color plates), and the story itself follows the adventures of the Patchwork Girl with some new characters invented by Neill.

==Non-Oz work==
Neill illustrated dozens of books that were not written by Baum. One of the most notable of Neill&#x27;s non-Baum books was his adaptation of Helen Bannerman&#x27;s 1899 story, &quot;Little Black Sambo&quot;. Neill&#x27;s edition of &quot;Little Black Sambo&quot;, which was published by Reilly and Britton in 1908, included a short story called &quot;The Story of Topsy from Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin.&quot;

==Legacy==

In 2018, &quot;The Lost Art of Oz&quot; project was initiated to locate and catalogue the surviving original artwork John R. Neill, W.W. Denslow, Frank Kramer, Richard &#x27;Dirk&#x27; Gringhuis and Dick Martin created to illustrate the Oz book series.

<doc id="411399" wikidata="Q316694" url="?curid=411399" title="Rhetorical question">
<text>A rhetorical question is a question asked for a purpose other than to obtain information. In many cases it may be intended to start a discourse, as a means of displaying or emphasizing the speaker&#x27;s or author&#x27;s opinion on a topic.

A simple example is the question &quot;Can&#x27;t you do anything right?&quot; This question is intended not to ask about the listener&#x27;s ability but rather to insinuate the listener&#x27;s lack of ability.

==Forms==
===Negative assertions===
A rhetorical question may be intended as a challenge. The question is often difficult or impossible to answer. In the example, &quot;What have the Romans ever done for us?&quot; (&quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot;) the question functions as a negative assertion. It is intended to mean &quot;The Romans have never done anything for us!&quot; When Shakespeare&#x27;s Mark Antony exclaims, &quot;Here was a Caesar! When comes such another?&quot; it functions as an assertion that Caesar possesses such rare qualities they may never be seen again. (&quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, Act 3, scene 2, 257)

Negative assertions may function as positives in sarcastic contexts. For example, in response to being informed that smoking can increase the possibility of developing lung cancer, someone could respond with the question, &quot;Who knew?&quot; The question functions as an assertion that the truth of the statement should have been utterly obvious.

===Metaphors===
Rhetorical questions are often used as a metaphor for a question already asked. Examples may be found in the song &quot;Maria&quot; from the 1959 Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, in which &quot;How do you solve a problem like Maria?&quot; is repeatedly answered with other questions: &quot;How do you catch a cloud and pin it down?&quot;, &quot;How do you keep a wave upon the sand?&quot; and &quot;How do you hold a moonbeam in your hand?&quot; These responses assert that a problem like Maria cannot be solved.

===Vernacular===
In the vernacular, this form of rhetorical question is called &quot;rhetorical affirmation&quot;. The certainty or obviousness of the answer to a question is expressed by asking another, often humorous, question for which the answer is equally obvious. Popular examples include &quot;Do bears shit in the woods?&quot;, &quot;Is the sky blue?&quot; and &quot;Is the Pope Catholic?&quot;

===Hypophora===
The hypophora is a hyponym of a rhetorical question, characterized by the speaker posing a question for which is immediately answered by the speaker themself. 
Examples:
&quot;“Do you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it.&quot;&quot; - The Great Gatsby. This can moreover be a manifestation of an epiphrase, as Daisy had personally asserted her own opinion on her question.

==Punctuation==
Depending on the context, a rhetorical question may be punctuated by a question mark (?), full stop (.), or exclamation mark (!), but some sources argue that it is required to use a question mark for any question, rhetorical or not.

In the 1580s, English printer Henry Denham invented a &quot;rhetorical question mark&quot; (⸮) for use at the end of a rhetorical question; however, it fell out of use in the 17th century. It was the reverse of an ordinary question mark, so that instead of the main opening pointing back into the sentence, it opened away from it.

<text>Raymond Orteig (1870 – 6 June 1939) was a French American hotel owner in New York City in the early 20th century. He is best known for setting up the $25,000 Orteig Prize in 1919 for the first non-stop transatlantic flight between New York City and Paris, which was claimed by Charles Lindbergh eight years later in 1927.

==Early life and business activities==
Orteig was born in 1870 in the village of Louvie-Juzon in the region of Pyrénées-Atlantiques in southwest France. After spending part of his childhood looking after his father&#x27;s sheep in the Pyrenees, Orteig emigrated at age 12, arriving in New York City on 13 October 1882 with 13 francs in his pocket to join an uncle living in New York City.
He started working as a bar porter at Wengler&#x27;s Restaurant on William Street on Lower Manhattan. 

Gaining experience, he moved on to a position as waiter and then as a &quot;maître d&#x27;&quot; at the Martin Hotel on University Place on 9th Street, owned by Jean-Baptiste Martin. By the time Martin decided to move uptown in 1902, Orteig was in a position to buy the hotel, which he renamed Hotel Lafayette. Together with a business partner, Orteig was also able to lease the rundown Brevoort Hotel on the northeast corner of Fifth Avenue and 8th Street in Greenwich Village, and later refurbish it.

The Lafayette soon became a favourite gathering spot for airmen in the 1910s during and after World War I, and Orteig became acquainted with many of them, including French officers who were on temporary duty in the United States as advisors helping build the nascent United States Air Force. After the end of the World War I, whenever he could, he and his family would spend the summer in Louvie-Juzon. This lifelong interest in the region of his birth lead to him expanding his business by the purchasing the Henri IV Hotel in the town of Pau.

By his mid fifties Ortieg was in semi-retirement with daily operations at his establishments managed by his three sons and his business partner, Elie Pierre Daution. In 1925 Orteig and Daution funded a $200,000 refurbishment of the Brevoort Hotel.

His support of many charities and causes made him a leading figure in New York City&#x27;s French community. This led to him being made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour.

==Orteig Prize==
In 1919 he attended a dinner in New York City organised by the Aero Club of America honouring the American flying ace Eddie Rickenbacker. Many of the speeches involved Franco-American friendship and Rickenbacker said he was looking forward to the day that the two countries are linked by air. 

Inspired by Rickenbacker&#x27;s speech, Orteig offered a prize of $25,000 to the first person of any Allied country to fly in one flight in either direction between New York City and Paris. The offer was made in a letter to Alan R. Hawley, then president of the Aero Club of America, on 22 May 1919. At the time, relations were strained between America and France because of the post-war negotiations at the Paris Peace Conference, so Orteig hoped that the prize would help improve relations between his adopted and native countries, as well encourage air travel and advertise his business. His offer was accepted by the Aero Club of America, who went on to set up a formal structure to administer it. The prize was initially set to be valid for five years.

After its original term had expired, Orteig reissued the Prize on 1 June 1925, by depositing $25,000 in negotiable securities at the Bryant Bank with the awarding put under the control of a seven-member board of trustees.

In May 1927, Orteig and his wife were on holiday in Pau, France, when he received a message from his son Raymond Jr that Charles Lindbergh had departed New York City. Orteig immediately travelled to Paris, arriving just before Lindbergh&#x27;s Spirit of St. Louis touched down at Le Bourget. He was able to meet Lindbergh at the American Embassy on 22 May 1927, eight years to the day since he had first offered the prize.

Upon his departure from Paris to Belgium, Lindbergh dropped a message of thanks to Parisians from his plane as he flew over the Place de la Concorde. The message was attached to a French flag. Upon being retrieved, the flag was presented to Orteig who displayed it on the wall of the Lafayette in New York, until his family later removed it in protest at Lindbergh&#x27;s involvement in the America First movement in the 1940s.

Upon Lindbergh&#x27;s return to America, Orteig officially presented the Prize to him on 16 June 1927 at a ceremony held in the reception hall of the Breevort Hotel in New York City. Over the preceding decade, the Orteig Prize is said to have become an inspiring incentive and marked a major shift in aviation progress during the late 1920s and early 1930s.

Orteig died on 6 June 1939 at the French Hospital in New York City after a long illness, with 500 people attending his funeral.

He was married to French American Marie Ruisquès, by whom he had three sons, Evariste, Raymond Jr and Jean. The two oldest children married daughters of his longtime business partner Elie Daution.

<text>Eerie, Indiana is an American horror science fiction television series that originally aired on NBC from September 15, 1991, to December 9, 1993. The series was created by José Rivera and Karl Schaefer, with Joe Dante serving as creative consultant.

A total of nineteen episodes were produced. The final episode aired for the first time in 1993, when the series was syndicated on The Disney Channel. The show was rerun on The Disney Channel from October 7, 1993 to late March 1996. In 1997, the show generated a new fan base, when the Fox Kids Network aired the series on Saturday mornings from January to September, gaining something of a cult following despite its short run. The renewed popularity of the series encouraged Fox Kids to produce a spin-off &quot;Eerie, Indiana: The Other Dimension&quot;, lasting only one season in 1998.

==Overview==
The series revolves around Marshall Teller, a teenager whose family moves to the desolate town of Eerie, Indiana, population of 16,661. While moving into his new home, he meets Simon Holmes, one of the few normal people in Eerie. Together, they are faced with bizarre scenarios, which include discovering a sinister group of intelligent dogs that are planning on taking over the world, and meeting a tornado hunter who is reminiscent of Captain Ahab. They also confront numerous urban legends such as Bigfoot and a still-living Elvis Presley. Although the show was host to a plethora of jokes, it also featured a serious tone.

After thirteen episodes, one of which did not air during the network run, the series was retooled with Jason Marsden&#x27;s &quot;Dash X&quot; added to the cast, while Archie Hahn&#x27;s Mr. Radford revealed to be an imposter, with John Astin revealed as the &quot;actual&quot; Mr. Radford. The final produced episode was a tongue-in-cheek, fourth-wall-breaking sequence of events depicting Dash X&#x27;s attempts to take over as star of the show.

==Production==
===Writing===
Each episode was strewn with in-jokes and references to old films, particularly horror films:

* In the episode &quot;Heart on a Chain&quot;, a scene begins with a shot of a spider web before panning right to the action taking place. While looking at the spider web, one can faintly hear a high-pitched voice crying &quot;Help me! Help me!&quot;, a reference to the 1958 version of &quot;The Fly&quot;. Also in this episode, Marshall&#x27;s creepy English teacher is called Miss Annabel Lee, a reference to the Edgar Allan Poe poem of the same name. Right at the end of the episode, the Grim Reaper is seen in the background.
* In the episode &quot;Mr. Chaney&quot;, Marshall meets a werewolf that, while in human form, goes by the name of &quot;Mr. Chaney&quot;, a nod to Lon Chaney Jr. who played the title role in the 1941 version of &quot;The Wolf Man&quot;. In this same episode, there is a reference to the 1981 film &quot;The Howling&quot;, a film about werewolves directed by Joe Dante, himself an occasional director of the show. There is also a mention of David Lynch&#x27;s TV show &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; with Marshall exclaiming at one point &#x27;It&#x27;s you!&#x27; and the Grey Haired Kid, holding a log with which he just hit Mr. Chaney, replying &#x27;Well, it ain&#x27;t the Log Lady.&#x27;
* In the episode &quot;Just Say No Fun&quot;, the name of the school is B. F. Skinner Middle School in reference to the eponymous psychologist.
* In the episode &quot;America&#x27;s Scariest Home Video&quot;, an actor from a classic mummy movie is transported into the Teller home. The actor&#x27;s name is Boris Von Orloff, a reference to Boris Karloff, who played the title role in the 1932 film, &quot;The Mummy&quot;.
* In the episode &quot;The Retainer&quot;, the orthodontist&#x27;s name is Dr. Eukanuba, a reference to the dog food brand and the episode&#x27;s plot about evil dogs.
* In the episode &quot;No Brain, No Pain&quot;, a leather clad woman with sunglasses utters, &quot;I&#x27;ll be back&quot;, before hastily leaving Marshall and his friends. Her appearance and quote reminisces Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s role as &quot;The Terminator&quot;. She was also referred to as &quot;Mrs. Terminator&quot; by one of the boys. Incidentally Simon&#x27;s little brother&#x27;s middle name is &quot;Schwarzenegger&quot;. Additionally, an instrumental variation of the song &quot;My Sharona&quot; is played during portions of the episode, while the song is referenced several times. Marshall&#x27;s family eats at the Dragon of the Black Pool Chinese restaurant, a direct reference to the film &quot;Big Trouble in Little China&quot;.
* In the episode &quot;Reality Takes a Holiday&quot; Marshall says, &quot;I don&#x27;t have a dog named Toto. But, if I did, right about now I&#x27;d be telling him – Toto, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re in Indiana any more&quot;, a reference to &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. Later in the episode, Dash X says, &quot;he&#x27;s the kind of guy who actually believes that there&#x27;s no place like home&quot;.
* In the first episode, &quot;Forever Ware&#x27;&quot; Marshall says, &quot;Dad&#x27;s job is one of the reasons we moved here, because, statistically speaking, Eerie&#x27;s the most normal place in the entire country&quot;. This is a reference to the Middletown studies which served as a sociological case study of Muncie, Indiana in the 1920s and 1930s. Several references are also made to the popular children&#x27;s show &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. For example, the two twin boys are named Bertram and Ernest, or Bert and Ernie for short.
* Also in the first episode, Marshall jokes &quot;Where&#x27;s Donna Reed when you need her?&quot; This is a reference to &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot; where Reed played the typical 1950s housewife and foreshadows the arrival of Betty Wilson, whose look and characterization are heavily inspired by said show. Donna Reed also played the grandmother of Omri Katz&#x27;s character in &quot;Dallas&quot; between 1984 and 1985.

==Episodes==
A total of nineteen episodes of &quot;Eerie, Indiana&quot; were produced before the show&#x27;s cancellation. The episode &quot;The Broken Record&quot; was the only episode which did not air before the show&#x27;s retooling and was omitted during the show&#x27;s initial run on NBC. The episode aired for the first time on television when the series was syndicated on The Disney Channel in 1993.

The show&#x27;s producers planned to make an episode entitled &quot;The Jolly Rogers&quot;, which featured a group of pirates in search for buried treasure in the Teller house.

* &quot;The Hole in the Head Gang&quot; is the first episode in which the episode titles are shown on screen.

==Reception==

&quot;Eerie, Indiana&quot; was well received by critics when it debuted on television. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave it a &quot;B&quot; rating and Ken Tucker wrote &quot;You watch &quot;Eerie&quot; for the small-screen spectacle of it all—to see the way, in the show&#x27;s first few weeks, feature-film directors like Joe Dante (&quot;Gremlins&quot;) and Tim Hunter (&quot;River&#x27;s Edge&quot;) oversaw episodes that summoned up an atmosphere of absurdist suburban dread.&quot;

In his review for &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, Miles Beller wrote &quot;Scripted by Karl Schaefer and José Rivera with smart, sharp insights; slyly directed by feature film helmsman Joe Dante; and given edgy life by the show&#x27;s winning cast, &quot;Eerie, Indiana&quot; shapes up as one of the fall season&#x27;s standouts, a newcomer that has the fresh, bracing look of &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; and scores as a clever, wry presentation well worth watching.&quot; In his review for the &quot;Orange County Register&quot;, Ray Richmond wrote &quot;It&#x27;s the kind of knowingly hip series with equally strong appeal for both kids and adults, the kind that preteens will watch and discuss.&quot;

&quot;USA Today&quot; described the show as &quot;Stephen King by way of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and Matt Roush wrote &quot;Eerie&quot; recalls &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; and even—heaven help it—David Lynch in its garish nightmare-comedy depiction of the lurid and silly horrors that lurk beneath suburban conformity.&quot; In his review for &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, David Klinghoffer wrote &quot;Everything about the pilot exceeds the normal minimal expectations of TV. Mr. Dante directs as if he were making a movie, and a good one. In a departure from usual TV operating procedures, he sometimes actually has more than one thing going on on screen at the same time!&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; noted the show is heavily inspired by elements from &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; and &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;.

==Broadcast history==
In the UK, &quot;Eerie, Indiana&quot; was shown on Channel 4 from March to July 1993.

In 2012, the entire series was added to the Hulu website.

Reruns of the series began in August 2012 on the now-defunct Fearnet, airing weekend mornings on their &quot;Funhouse&quot; block.

As of 2022, the series is available to stream on Amazon Freevee and Tubi.

==Spin-off series==
In 1997, the show generated a new fan base, when Fox&#x27;s children&#x27;s programming block Fox Kids aired the series. The following year, a spin-off series was produced entitled, &quot;Eerie, Indiana: The Other Dimension&quot;. The series was filmed in Canada and focused on another, younger boy while still following the concept of the original show. The spin-off lasted one season. The first episode of the spin-off, &quot;Switching Channels&quot;, features a crossover between the two shows via a TV set.

==Home media==
On October 12, 2004, Alpha Video released &quot;Eerie, Indiana: The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1. The 5-disc box set features all nineteen episodes of the original series.

==In other media==

<doc id="411409" wikidata="Q558923" url="?curid=411409" title="McDonald's urban legends">
<text>There are multiple urban legends centering around the fast-food chain McDonald&#x27;s. These legends include claims about the food and allegations of discrimination by the company. The company also denies all these claims

==Funding terrorism==

In the late 1980s, rumors persisted in the United Kingdom that McDonald&#x27;s was covertly funding the Provisional IRA, which was designated as a terror organization, via NORAID. The source of these rumors was eventually traced to a CNN talk show in which the company was praised for its generosity in providing funding for employees via Individual Retirement Accounts, or IRAs.

==Unusual ingredients==
Large companies have been the subject of rumors that they substitute unusual or unethical substances in their products, usually to decrease costs. McDonald&#x27;s is not immune to such claims.

=== 100% Beef ===
An untrue but pervasive claim is that McDonald&#x27;s buys its meat from a company called &quot;100% Beef&quot;, making it possible for McDonald&#x27;s to call beef by-products and soy products &quot;100% beef&quot;.

===Chayote as mock apple pie===
In Australia, a persistent urban legend is that McDonald&#x27;s apple pies were made of chokos (chayotes), not apples. This eventually led McDonald&#x27;s to emphasise the fact that real apples are used in their pies. This legend was based on an earlier belief that tinned pears were often disguised chayotes. A possible explanation for the rumor is that there are a number of recipes in Australia that advise chayotes can be used in part replacement of canned apples to make the fruit go farther in making apple pies. This likely arose because of the economies of &quot;mock&quot; food substitutes during the Depression Era, shortages of canned fruit in the years following World War II, and the fact that apples do not grow in many tropical and subtropical parts of Australia, making them scarce. Chayotes, on the other hand, grow extensively in Australia, with many suburban backyards featuring chayote vines growing along their fence lines and outhouses.

===Confectionery cheeseburgers===

One story claims that if McDonald&#x27;s cheeseburgers did not include pickles as an ingredient, the cheeseburger would be classed as a confectionery item. It stems from the belief that the sugar content in the bun is high, but adding a pickle then keeps the overall sugar percentage below the threshold of what is classed as confectionery. McDonald&#x27;s have stated that this story is an urban legend.

===Cow eyeballs===
One belief is that McDonald&#x27;s uses cow eyeballs in its products, permitting it to brand them as &quot;100% beef&quot;. However, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) mandates that all beef by-products, including cow eyeballs, be appropriately labeled. McDonald&#x27;s has asserted that its products contain &quot;100% pure USDA-inspected beef; no additives, no fillers, no extenders.&quot; In addition, cow eyeballs are actually more expensive than the more commonly eaten cow parts due to demand from scientific institutions for experiments.

===Earthworms===
Dating back to at least 1978, this rumor claims that McDonald&#x27;s restaurants use earthworms in their hamburgers. This &quot;worm-in-the-burger&quot; rumor was originally attached to Wendy&#x27;s burgers.

=== Human meat ===
A claim circulating since 2014, including in a video, is that McDonald&#x27;s uses human meat in their hamburgers. The claim originates from a satire blog.

===Mutant laboratory meat===
Around March–April 2000, an internet rumor spread via e-mail in Brazil claimed that McDonald&#x27;s meat was actually made from a genetically modified animal maintained in a laboratory, attributing the findings to the Michigan State University. The e-mail stated that the creatures kept were &quot;figures without legs and without horns, which are fed through tubes connected to the stomach and which in fact have no bones, but a little cartilage that never develops&quot;, and &quot;anyone who has seen them assures them that they are very unpleasant things, because in addition to remaining immobile all their &#x27;life&#x27;, they have no eyes, no tail and practically no fur; in fact the head is the size of a tennis ball&quot;.

The e-mail carries on saying that &quot;some irreversible health damage can be done by eating this meat, resulting in diseases who manifest themselves in a way similar to AIDS, and have symptoms related to Alzheimer&#x27;s disease&quot; and ends encouraging the reader to boycott McDonald&#x27;s until it sells actual beef. The urban legend has also been attributed to other fast-food chains and animal products, such as KFC and mutant chickens.

===Pig fat===
This rumor is that McDonald&#x27;s uses pig fat in its milkshakes, ice cream, and fried potatoes. McDonald&#x27;s provides complete ingredient lists for all of its products on each of its regional websites: this includes unidentified fats within the ice cream used to make soft-serve cones and sundaes. The claim that McDonald&#x27;s dairy products contain pig fat has been denied by the company on several occasions.

=== Pink slime ===
Around 2014, a photo of &quot;pink slime&quot; or &quot;pink goop&quot; was widely shared and claimed to be what Chicken McNuggets were made of. This has led to McDonald&#x27;s Canada releasing a video showcasing how Chicken McNuggets are actually made in response.

==Racism==

Rumors in 2011 proclaimed an image shows a McDonald&#x27;s sign announcing a $1.50 surcharge for African-American customers. This was proven to be a hoax.

==Drugs==
Since 2015, fake news websites have purported that McDonald&#x27;s restaurants in Colorado are converting children&#x27;s playgrounds to lounges for on-premises cannabis consumption. The story was started on the fake news website Now 8 News.

<text>McDonald&#x27;s maintains an extensive advertising campaign. In addition to the usual media such as television, radio and newspaper ads, the company makes significant use of billboards and signage, and sponsors sporting events ranging from Little League to the FIFA World Cup and Olympic Games. The company also makes coolers of orange drink with their logo available for local events of all kinds. However, television ads remain the primary form of advertisement.

McDonald&#x27;s has used 23 different slogans to advertise in the United States, as well as a few other slogans for select countries and regions. At times, it has run into trouble with its campaigns.

==History==
There have been many McDonald&#x27;s advertising campaigns and slogans over the years. The company is one of the most prevalent fast food advertisers, especially in the United States, where it spends the most advertising money of any fast-food restaurant and the fifth-more of any advertiser in the country. McDonald&#x27;s Canada&#x27;s corporate website states that the commercial campaigns have always focused on the &quot;overall McDonald&#x27;s experience&quot;, rather than just product. The purpose of the image has always been &quot;portraying warmth and a real slice of everyday life&quot;. Its TV ads, showing various people engaging in popular activities, usually reflect the season and time period. Finally, rarely in their advertising history have they used negative or comparison ads pertaining to any of their competitors; the ads have always focused on McDonald&#x27;s alone, one exception being a 2008 billboard advertising the new McCafé espresso. The billboard read &quot;four bucks is dumb&quot;, a shot at competitor Starbucks.

===Controversies===

:—&quot;Viz&quot; Top Tip, published May 1989.
Save a fortune on laundry bills. Give your dirty shirts to a second-hand shop. They will wash and iron them, and then you can buy them back for 50p.
:—McDonald&#x27;s advert, 1996.
In 2003, a ruling by the UK Advertising Standards Authority determined that the corporation had acted in breach of the codes of practice in describing how its French fries were prepared. A McDonald&#x27;s print ad stated that &quot;after selecting certain potatoes&quot; &quot;we peel them, slice them, fry them and that&#x27;s it.&quot; It showed a picture of a potato in a McDonald&#x27;s fries box. In fact the product was sliced, pre-fried, sometimes had dextrose added, was then frozen, shipped, and re-fried and then had salt added.

In 2013, McDonald&#x27;s encountered controversy around negative racial stereotypes when the fast-food restaurant tested one of its ads in Germany for the resident Mexican population. The title of the commercial was &quot;Los Wochos&quot;, a made-up word for the Spanish translation of the word &#x27;week&#x27; () in German. The commercial went on to say, &quot;When you turn ketchup into &#x27;salsa picante&#x27;, your buddy into a &#x27;muchacho&#x27; and your burger into &#x27;chili con carne&#x27;, that means The Wochos are here. Olé.&quot; The problem was that not all of these terms are of Mexican origin; rather, &quot;olé&quot; is a typical expression of southern Spain, while the &quot;Latin Times&quot; claimed that chili con carne is a Texan dish.

In 2015, McDonald&#x27;s met further controversy around Mexican stereotypes when it attempted to promote its McBurrito in Mexico. The advertisement was a picture of the burrito with the words, &quot;Tamales are a thing of the past. McBurrito Mexicana also comes wrapped.&quot; The ad was revealed just a day after la Día de la Candelaria (Candlemas, 2 February), a holiday many celebrate with eating tamales, a traditional Mexican dish eaten during most holidays. The Tex-Mex burrito was perceived by many as an insult to one of Mexico&#x27;s most traditional and popular meals.

In 2019, McDonald&#x27;s pulled out of an advertisement deal with an American comedy podcast, &quot;Your Mom&#x27;s House&quot; podcast. The reason cited for ending the deal was due to a portion of the podcast being dedicated to clips honoring, &quot;Cool Guys&quot;. The primary clip that provoked McDonald&#x27;s, now known as the &quot;Uncle Terry&quot; clip, showing a nude man reviewing and using various sex toys to completion. Following the initial controversy, McDonald&#x27;s garnered outrage from various LGBTQIA+ groups for not being inclusive enough to sexually explorative demographics. This outrage resulted in McDonald&#x27;s returning the advertisement deal to &quot;Your Mom&#x27;s House&quot; podcast after only a few weeks.

Also in 2019, McDonald&#x27;s Portugal promoted a sundae for Halloween with advertising that dubbed it &quot;Sundae Bloody Sundae&quot;. This generated controversy on social networks in the British-Irish territories due to the name&#x27;s connotation with the Bloody Sunday massacre in 1972. McDonald&#x27;s issued an apology for &quot;any offense or distress&quot; and withdrew its promotions. &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot; is a name that commemorates the day in 1972 on which 26 unarmed protesters in Derry, Northern Ireland, were shot by British soldiers during &quot;the Troubles&quot;, a domestic conflict in Northern Ireland during the late 20th century. This resulted in 14 deaths. McDonald&#x27;s said it was intended as a local promotion of Halloween and not intended to insult anyone.

=== Racial diversity ===
In the 1970s, McDonald&#x27;s began to diversify their target audience towards the back end of the civil rights movement at the time. To modern audiences, the advertising style in this given campaign appears stereotypical and is a clear example of tokenism. However, at the time it was seen as a huge step forward in terms of overcoming racial issues.

In order to appeal to African-American people, McDonald&#x27;s exclusively used images of African-American people enjoying a McDonald&#x27;s meal in their ads. They also adopted linguistic features which were &quot;typical&quot; in that particular culture, such as &quot;g-dropping&quot; for example &quot;Makin&#x27; it&quot; or &quot;Dinnertimin&#x27;&quot;. Additionally, McDonald&#x27;s also introduced the &quot;Get Down&quot; campaign which was a popular dance move, get down, in the African American culture at the time.

As McDonald&#x27;s was mainly a &quot;white-dominated&quot; agency at the time, it seemed that even though they were attempted to make good with these ad campaigns, they only really achieved appearing &quot;racially naive&quot; and also heavily relied on fraught stereotypes rather than actual information (Charlton McIlwain 2015). Another notion, coined by Tom Burrell (2003:240), was &quot;positive realism&quot; which &quot;depicted African-Americans using consumer products in a manner that was authentic and relevant&quot;. This term is thought to have influenced and encouraged the depiction of African-Americans in advertising.

==Current campaign==
I&#x27;m lovin&#x27; it is a branding campaign by McDonald&#x27;s Corporation. It was created by Heye &amp; Partner, McDonald&#x27;s agency based in Unterhaching, Germany, near Munich, and a member of the DDB Worldwide Communications Group. It was the company&#x27;s first global advertising campaign and was unveiled in Chicago on June 12, 2003, and launched in Munich on September 2, 2003, under the German title . This is only used in Germany; in Austria, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein, the English slogan is used. The English part of the campaign was launched in the UK on September 17, 2003, and in Australia and the United States on September 21, 2003, with the music of Tom Batoy and Franco Tortora (Mona Davis Music) and vocals by Justin Timberlake, in which the slogan appears. The motion logo at the time (featuring the &quot;M&quot; zooming out to a 5-note jingle based on the song&#x27;s &quot;ba da ba ba ba&quot; lyric) and the &quot;I&#x27;m lovin&#x27; it&quot; (in different languages, usually in English) zooming to the &quot;M&quot;, leaving a trail) was produced by using Adobe After Effects and Adobe InDesign. Also, by September 3, 2003, McDonald&#x27;s selected more than 30 people to appear in new packaging for McDonald&#x27;s products, starting with a photoshoot taking place from September 3, 2003, until November 2003. They unveiled new &quot;I&#x27;m lovin&#x27; it&quot;–themed packaging on December 8, 2003, and rolled it out worldwide throughout 2004 with the final delivery date being November 20, 2004. In January 2007, after a public casting call which received 15,000 submissions, McDonald&#x27;s selected 24 people to appear as part of the campaign. Images of those chosen, taken from September to December 2006, who had submitted a story and digital photograph which &quot;captured ... themes of inspiration, passion and fun&quot; appeared on McDonald&#x27;s paper bags and cups worldwide.

In early 2008, McDonald&#x27;s underwent the first phase of their new image and slogan: &quot;What we&#x27;re made of.&quot; This was to promote how McDonald&#x27;s products are made. Packaging was tweaked a little to feature this new slogan. In November 2008, McDonald&#x27;s introduced new packaging, eliminating the previous design stated above (except for the Philippines and a few countries where the previous design is used in tandem with newer packaging, and in Fiji where the previous design is still current) with new, inspirational messages, the &quot;I&#x27;m lovin it&quot; slogan (appearing only once on most packages). McDonald&#x27;s also updated their menu boards with darker, yet warmer colors, more realistic photos of the products featured on plates and the drinks in glasses. From 2009 to 2010, McDonald&#x27;s introduced new packaging worldwide. As of 2017, McDonald&#x27;s continues to have the &quot;I&#x27;m lovin it&quot; slogan appear on most all of its product packaging, and has made no major announcement that the company will use any other slogan exclusively in place of this one any time in the near future. The 5-note jingle from 2003 continues to be used in most McDonald&#x27;s advertising to this day in the form of a whistled version.

In April 2024, the company debuted plain yellow and red billboards in the Netherlands, the world&#x27;s first that smell like McDonald&#x27;s.

<doc id="411414" wikidata="Q1070547" url="?curid=411414" title="Chesapeake Bay impact crater">
<text>The Chesapeake Bay impact crater is a buried impact crater, located beneath the mouth of Chesapeake Bay, United States. It was formed by a bolide that struck the eastern shore of North America about 35.5 ± 0.3 million years ago, in the late Eocene epoch. It is one of the best-preserved &quot;wet-target&quot; impact craters in the world.

Continued slumping of sediments over the rubble of the crater has helped shape the Chesapeake Bay.

==Formation and aftermath==
During the warm late Eocene, sea levels were high, and the tidewater region of Virginia lay in the coastal shallows. The shore of eastern North America, about where Richmond, Virginia is today, was covered with thick tropical rainforest, and the waters of the gently sloping continental shelf were rich with marine life that was depositing dense layers of lime from their microscopic shells.
The bolide made impact at a speed of approximately , punching a deep hole through the sediments and into the granite continental basement rock. The bolide itself was completely vaporized, fracturing the basement rock to depths of , and raising a peak ring around it. The deep crater, across, is surrounded by a flat-floored terrace-like ring trough with an outer edge of collapsed blocks forming ring faults.

The entire circular crater is about in diameter and deep, an area twice the size of Rhode Island, and nearly as deep as the Grand Canyon. However, numerical modeling techniques by Collins et al. indicate that the post-impact diameter was likely to have been around , rather than the observed .

The surrounding region suffered massive devastation. USGS scientist David Powars, one of the impact crater&#x27;s discoverers, described the immediate aftermath: &quot;Within minutes, millions of tons of water, sediment, and shattered rock were cast high into the atmosphere for hundreds of miles along the East Coast.&quot; An enormous megatsunami engulfed the land and possibly even reached the Blue Ridge Mountains. The sedimentary walls of the crater progressively slumped in, widened the crater, and formed a layer of huge blocks on the floor of the ring-like trough. The slump blocks were then covered with the rubble or &quot;breccia&quot;. The entire bolide event, from initial impact to the termination of breccia deposition, lasted only a few hours or days. In the perspective of geological time, the breccia was an instantaneous deposit. The crater was then buried by additional sedimentary beds that have accumulated during the 35 million years following the impact.

The impact has been identified as the source of the North American tektite field, namely the Georgiaite and Bediasite fields.

==Discovery==
It was not until 1983 that evidence of a large impact crater was found, buried beneath the lower part of the Chesapeake Bay and its surrounding peninsulas. The first hint was an layer of ejecta found in a drilling core taken off Atlantic City, New Jersey, about to the north. The layer contained the fused glass beads called tektites and shocked quartz grains that are unmistakable signs of a bolide impact.

In 1993, data from oil exploration revealed the extent of the crater.

==Effects on local rivers==
The continual slumping of the rubble within the crater has affected the flow of the rivers and shaped the Chesapeake Bay. The impact crater created a long-lasting topographic depression which helped predetermine the course of local rivers and the eventual location of the Chesapeake Bay. Most important for present-day inhabitants of the area, the impact disrupted aquifers. The present freshwater aquifers lie above a deep salty brine, remnants of 100- to 145-million-year-old Early Cretaceous North Atlantic seawater, making the entire lower Chesapeake Bay area susceptible to groundwater contamination.

<text>In computing, rebasing is the process of modifying data based on one reference to another. It can be one of the following:

==Shared libraries==
Rebasing is the process of creating a shared library image in such a way that it is guaranteed to use virtual memory without conflicting with any other shared libraries loadable in the system. 

IBM VM/370 &quot;discontinuous saved segments&quot; (DCSS) were an early example of this technique, though not called &quot;rebasing&quot;. The technique is used extensively on Win32 platforms to avoid the overhead of address relocation of system DLLs by the loader. 

Some security extensions to Linux/x86 use rebasing to force the use of code addresses below codice_1 in order to introduce a codice_2 byte into all code pointers; This eliminates a certain class of buffer overflow security problems related to improper checking of null-terminated strings, common in the C programming language.

==Other uses==
* Rebasing is the act of moving changesets to a different branch when using a revision control system or in some systems, by synchronizing a branch with the originating branch by merging all new changes in the latter to the former. For example, Git and Darcs do this (but Darcs extends the concept and calls it &quot;patch commutation&quot;).
* The mechanism that the Microsoft Exchange or Outlook daylight saving time (DST) rebasing tool TZMOVE.EXE uses to recalculate and reschedule appointment dates that are affected by DST.

<doc id="411419" wikidata="Q5291061" url="?curid=411419" title="Dominion Lands Act">
<text>The Dominion Lands Act () was an 1872 Canadian law that aimed to encourage the settlement of the Canadian Prairies and to help prevent the area being claimed by the United States. The Act was closely based on the U.S. &quot;Homestead Act of 1862&quot;, setting conditions in which the western lands could be settled and their natural resources developed.

In 1871, the Government of Canada entered into Treaty 1 and Treaty 2 to obtain the consent of the Indigenous nations from the territories set out respectively in each Treaty. The Treaties provided for the taking up of lands &quot;for immigration and settlement&quot;. In order to settle the area, Canada invited mass emigration by European and American pioneers, and by settlers from eastern Canada. It echoed the American homestead system by offering ownership of 160 acres of land free (except for a small registration fee) to any man over 18 or any woman heading a household. They did not need to be British subjects, but had to live on the plot and improve it.

==Application==
Britain had taken possession of lands in western Canada in the form of Rupert&#x27;s Land, which was then transferred to Canada after Confederation. Canada established the province of Manitoba and the Northwest Territories. Additionally, some land was set aside for the national railway and some land remained under the control of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, leaving the rest as public lands, to be negotiated with the Indigenous peoples. From 1871 onwards, the Government of Canada negotiated the Numbered Treaties on behalf of the Crown with the First Nations of western Canada to extinguish aboriginal title, establish reserves and establish federal obligations such as education and health care in exchange for lands to settle. Today, there are concerns by the First Nations of western Canada that the Numbered Treaties did not cover all title issues. The First Nations assert they were not only not fairly compensated for their lands, but that only the lands taken up for immigration and settlement were covered in the treaties and that other lands and natural resources were not covered.

Canada passed the &quot;Dominion Lands Act&quot; in 1872 to encourage settlement. The Act was applied to the province of Manitoba and to the Northwest Territories. Upon the creation of the provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta from the Northwest Territories, the Act continued to apply to them. It was also extended to the Peace River Block of British Columbia. In 1876, the Act was amended to prohibit single women from claiming a homestead, except those classified as the head of a household, which effectively limited female participation to widows with dependent children; this contrasted with the United States, where single women were permitted to homestead. In 1930, the federal government agreed to transfer control over the public lands and natural resources to the prairie provinces by means of the &quot;Natural Resources Acts&quot;. From that point onwards, the &quot;Dominion Lands Act&quot; only applied in the North-West Territories.

==Requirements==
The Act gave a claimant for free, the only cost to the farmer being a $10 administration fee. Any male farmer who was at least 21 years of age and agreed to cultivate at least of the land and build a permanent dwelling on it (within three years) qualified. This condition of &quot;proving up the homestead&quot; was instituted to prevent speculators from gaining control of the land.

The Act also launched the Dominion Lands Survey, which laid the framework for the layout of the Prairie provinces that continues to this day.

An important difference between the Canadian and U.S. systems was that farmers under the Canadian system could buy a neighboring lot for an additional $10 registration fee, once they had made certain improvements to their original quarter-section. This allowed most farmsteads to quickly double in size, and was especially important in the southern Palliser&#x27;s Triangle area of the prairies, which was very arid. There it was all but impossible to have a functional farm on only , but it could be managed with 320. Canadian agriculture was consequently more successful than U.S. agriculture in this arid region.

Bloc settlements were encouraged by section 37 which allowed associations of 10 or more settlers to group their houses together to form a settlement to fulfil their cultivation obligations on their own homestead while residing in a hamlet.

==Results==
The first version of the Act set up extensive exclusion zones. Claimants were limited to areas further than from any railway (much of the land closer having been granted to the railways at the time of construction). Since it was extremely difficult to farm wheat profitably if you had to transport it over by wagon, this was a major discouragement. Farmers could buy land within the zone, but at a much higher price of . In 1879, the exclusion zone was shrunk to only from the tracks; and in 1882 it was finally eliminated.

Less than half of the arable land in the West was ever open to farmers for homesteading under the Act. The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, which had once controlled the entire prairies, had kept five percent of the land as part of the terms of the surrender of its charter. Both the railways and Hudson&#x27;s Bay sold land to land companies and to farmers on the open market. Additional areas were set aside for schools and government buildings. Overall, about of land was sold away by the Government of Canada under the Act.

==Repeal of the Act==
From 1930 onwards, the Act only applied to the public lands in the Northwest Territories. The homestead provisions of the Act, designed to encourage agricultural settlement on the prairies, had little application to the conditions in the Northwest Territories. Parliament repealed the Act in 1950, replacing it with the &quot;Territorial Lands Act&quot;, which was better adapted to the conditions in the Territories. The new Act did not contain any homesteading provisions.

<doc id="411422" wikidata="Q467712" url="?curid=411422" title="Josep Lluís Sert">
<text>Josep Lluís Sert i López (; 1 July 190215 March 1983) was a Catalan architect and city planner established in the USA after 1939.

==Biography==
Born in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, Sert showed keen interest in the works of his uncle, the painter Josep Maria Sert, and of Antoni Gaudí. He studied architecture at the Escola Superior d&#x27;Arquitectura in Barcelona and set up his own studio in 1929. That same year Sert moved to Paris, in response to an invitation from Le Corbusier to work for him (without payment). Returning to Barcelona in 1930, he continued his practice there until 1937. During the 1930s, Sert co-founded the group GATCPAC (&quot;Grup d&#x27;Artistes i Tècnics Catalans per al Progrés de l&#x27;Arquitectura Contemporània&quot;, i.e. Group of Catalan Artists and Technicians for the Progress of Contemporary Architecture), which later was the prominent association, with the addition of the western and north groups, of the GATEPAC (Grupo de Artistas y Técnicos Españoles para el Progreso de l&#x27;Arquitectura Contemporánea), which was in turn the Spanish branch of the &quot;Congrès International d&#x27;Architecture Moderne&quot; (CIAM). Sometime later, Sert became President of CIAM (1947–1956). He created several outstanding pieces of modern architecture during this period, such as the week-end house in El Garraf, Catalonia (1935), the Central Dispensary of Barcelona (1935) and the Master Plan for the City of Barcelona (1933–1935). From 1937 through 1939, Sert lived in Paris, where he designed the Spanish Republic&#x27;s pavilion at the Paris Exposition of 1937. For the artistic content of the building, Sert called on his artist friends Pablo Picasso, Joan Miró, and Alexander Calder. Picasso&#x27;s contribution was &quot;Guernica&quot;, which became the focal attraction of Sert&#x27;s design.

===Career in the United States===

After the fascist forces of Francisco Franco won the Spanish Civil War in 1939, Sert, like most members of GATCPAC, was disqualified from practising as an architect in Spain, and went into exile in the United States, where he lived until Franco&#x27;s death, when he returned to Barcelona. In his first years in New York City he worked with the Town Planning Associates, carrying out numerous urban plans for cities in South America.


In 1952, Sert held a one-year Visiting Professorship at Yale University. The following year he became Dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Design (1953–1969). There, Sert initiated the world&#x27;s first degree program in urban design; integrated the programs of architecture, planning, landscape and urban design, and taught many of today&#x27;s leading architects. During this period, he served on the Advisory Board of the newly created Graham Foundation in Chicago, Illinois.

In 1955, Sert founded a studio in Cambridge, Massachusetts which in 1958 became a partnership with Huson Jackson and Ronald Gourley. Joseph Zalewski was the Associate and continued to be in the firm Sert, Jackson and Associates founded in 1963. The studio designed many well-known projects including the Maeght Foundation (1959–1964) in southern France, the Fundació Miró (museum) in Barcelona (1975) and quite a few buildings for Harvard University, including Holyoke Center (1958–1965), the Harvard Science Center (1969–1972), Peabody Terrace (apartments, 1962–1964), and the Center for the Study of World Religions at the Harvard Divinity School. Among other notable buildings in the vicinity are a complex at Boston University including its law school, student union, and main library (1960–1965), Sert&#x27;s home in Cambridge, as well as the Martin Luther King elementary school (1968–1971), located across from Peabody Terrace. In New York, he completed the Eastwood and Westview apartments on Roosevelt Island, NYC (1976).

In 1961, Sert brought Le Corbusier to the United States to design the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts at Harvard, and a gallery in the Carpenter Center is now named in Sert&#x27;s honor. In 1981, he received the AIA Gold Medal.

===The art world===
Josep Lluis Sert counted amongst his close friends the likes of Alexander Calder, Joan Miró, Georges Braque, and Marc Chagall, for whom he designed studios and homes. He brought art into the Harvard curriculum through his commissioning of the Carpenter Center and his subsequent avid support for it. His design for the Fondation Maeght in Saint-Paul-de-Vence, France, the Fundació Joan Miró in Barcelona and the Museum School were more than an architect-client relationship, they were partnerships in the discovery of modern art.

Among Sert&#x27;s students and colleagues in his studio were leading and past master architects from the United States, Spain, France, Bolivia and Brazil, Venezuela, as well as Dolf Schnebli of Switzerland, Fumihiko Maki of Japan, and Christopher Charles Benninger of India.

<text>Slendro () is one of the essential tuning systems used in gamelan instruments that have pentatonic scale. Based on Javanese mythology, the Slendro Gamelan tuning system is older than the &quot;pélog&quot; tuning system.

==Etymology==
Slendro is a Javanese term for one of the scales in gamelan. It is derived either from &quot;Sailendra&quot;, the name of the ruling family in the eighth and ninth centuries when Borobudur was built, or from the god Sang Hyang Hendra.

==History==
The origin of the &quot;slendro&quot; scale is unknown. However the name &quot;slendro&quot; is derived from Sailendra, the ancient dynasty of Mataram Kingdom in Central Java, and also Srivijaya. The &quot;slendro&quot; scale is thought to be brought to Srivijaya by Mahayana Buddhists from Gandhara of India, via Nalanda and Srivijaya from there to Java and Bali. It is similar to scales used in Indian and Chinese music as well as other areas of Asia and they all may have a common origin. A &quot;salendro&quot; scale is also found in the neighboring musical ensemble of Kulintang. This is very difficult if not impossible to determine.

Even within Indonesia, it is difficult to determine the evolution of scales. For example, scales used in Banyuwangi, at the eastern tip of Java, are very similar to scales used in Jembrana, a short distance away on Bali. There is probably no way to document which region influenced the other, or if they both evolved together.

==Tuning==
From one region of Indonesia to another the &quot;slendro&quot; scale often varies widely. The amount of variation also varies from region to region. For example, &quot;slendro&quot; in Central Java varies much less from gamelan to gamelan than it does in Bali, where ensembles from the same village may be tuned very differently. The five pitches of the Javanese version are roughly equally spaced within the octave.

As in &quot;pelog&quot;, although the intervals vary from one gamelan to the next, the intervals between notes in a scale are very close to identical for different instruments within the same &quot;gamelan&quot;. It is common in Balinese gamelan that instruments are played in pairs which are tuned slightly apart so as to produce interference beating which are ideally at a consistent speed for all pairs of notes in all registers. It is thought that this contributes to the very &quot;busy&quot; and &quot;shimmering&quot; sound of gamelan ensembles. In the religious ceremonies that contain &quot;gamelan&quot;, these interference beats are meant to give the listener a feeling of a god&#x27;s presence or a stepping stone to a meditative state.

For the instruments that do not need fixed pitches (such as suling and rebab) and the voice, other pitches are sometimes inserted into the scale. The Sundanese musicologist/teacher Raden Machjar Angga Koesoemadinata identified 17 vocal pitches used in &quot;slendro&quot;. These microtonal adjustments bear some similarity to Indian &quot;śruti&quot;.

==Note names==
In Java, the notes of the &quot;slendro&quot; scale can be designated in different ways; one common way is the use of numbers often called by their names in Javanese, especially in a shortened form. An older set uses names derived from parts of the body. Notice that both systems have the same designations for 5 and 6. There is no 4; possibly this is because it appears as an unusual tone in pelog and is not used when modulating between the systems.

The name &quot;barang&quot; is also sometimes used for 1 in &quot;slendro&quot; (it is the usual name for 7 in pelog); the octave is then designated as &quot;barang alit&quot;.

In Bali, the scale starts on the note named ding, and then continue going up the scale to dong, deng, dung and dang.

==Connotations==
For experienced participants in gamelan music, the &quot;pelog&quot; and &quot;slendro&quot; scales each have a particular feeling, related to the rituals and circumstances in which the scale is used. For example, in Bali, &quot;slendro&quot; is felt to have a sad sound because it is used as the tuning of gamelan angklung, the traditional ensemble for cremation ceremonies.

The connotation also depends on the &quot;pathet&quot; (roughly, the mode) used. There are three &quot;slendro pathet&quot; used in Javanese &quot;gamelan&quot;, &quot;nem&quot;, &quot;sanga&quot;, and &quot;manyura&quot;. That is the order in which they appear in a &quot;wayang&quot; performance, which historically used only &quot;slendro pathet&quot;. Consequently, they have the implications of where they appear in the evening.

<doc id="411428" wikidata="Q203423" url="?curid=411428" title="Zimbabwe African People's Union">
<text>The Zimbabwe African People&#x27;s Union (ZAPU) is a Zimbabwean political party. It is a militant communist organization and political party that campaigned for majority rule in Rhodesia, from its founding in 1961 until 1980. In 1987, it merged with the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU – PF).

The party was formed on 17 December 1961, 10 days after the Rhodesian government banned the National Democratic Party (NDP). It was founded by Joshua Nkomo as president, Samuel Parirenyatwa as vice-president, Ndabaningi Sithole as chairman, Jason Moyo as treasurer, Robert Mugabe as information and publicity secretary, and Leopold Takawira as external secretary. ZAPU was banned in 1962 by the Rhodesian white minority government, and later engaged in a guerrilla war against it. The armed wing of ZAPU, known as the Zimbabwe People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA), was founded by Moyo and commanded by General Lookout Masuku.

ZAPU was separate from ZANU as its armed wing, ZIPRA, was aligned with the Soviet Union, who prioritised mobilizing urban workers, whereas ZANU had a pro-People&#x27;s Republic of China orientation which prioritised mobilizing the rural peasantry.

It was relaunched in 2008 by Joshua Nkomo&#x27;s son, Michael Nkomo.

==Unification into ZANU-PF==

In 1980, ZAPU contested elections in Zimbabwe as the Patriotic Front, but lost to its rival ZANU. They merged into ZANU–PF in 1987 following the Gukurahundi massacres.

===Unity Accord===
The Unity Accord signed at that meeting stated that:

*ZANU and ZAPU have irrevocably committed themselves to unite under one political party.
*The unity of the two political parties; shall be achieved under the name Zimbabwe African National Union (Patriotic Front) in short ZANU – PF.
*Comrade Robert Gabriel Mugabe shall be the First Secretary and President of ZANU PF.
*ZANU PF shall have two Second Secretaries and vice-presidents, who shall be appointed by the First Secretary and President of the Party.
*ZANU PF shall seek to establish a socialist society in Zimbabwe on the guidance of Marxism–Leninism principles.
*ZANU PF shall seek to establish a One Party State in Zimbabwe.
*The leadership of ZANU – PF shall abide by the Leadership Code.
*The existing structures of ZANU – PF and PF ZAPU shall be merged in accordance with the letter and spirit of this Agreement.
*Both parties shall take immediate vigorous steps to eliminate and end the insecurity and violence prevalent in Matabeleland.
*ZANU – PF and PF ZAPU shall convene their respective Congress to give effect to this Agreement within the shortest possible time.
*In the interim Mugabe is vested with full powers to prepare for the implementation of this Agreement and to act in the name and authority of ZANU – PF.

==2008 withdrawal from Unity Accord==
Under the influence of Benny Ncube and Dumiso Dabengwa in mid-October 2008, in the midst of ongoing negotiations with rival parties, a group of former PF ZAPU and Zipra members loudly pushed to dissolve the alliance with ZANU – PF. The members convened a meeting on 8 November, and it was decided that:

*The political structure of ZAPU would cease to operate under the title ZANU – PF and to reassume the title ZAPU.
*All party structures would operate under the Constitution of ZAPU.
*The District Councils to meet to prepare for and convene a Consultative Conference consisting of the ten Provinces by December 2008, for the purpose of electing an Interim Executive charged with the responsibility to mobilise and restructure the party and convene the party Congress by March 2009, in terms of ZAPU constitution Article 6.
*A campaign to mobilise resources in the country to be undertaken forthwith, with support from well-wishers, from fraternal political parties and International Organisations.
*Engaging as necessary in the negotiations and peace-building initiatives to ameliorate the political and economic hardships afflicting the people of Zimbabwe.
*A consultative Conference consisting of all ten political Provinces by December 2008 will elect an Interim Executive, charged to mobilise and restructure the party and convene the Party&#x27;s Congress by March 2009, in terms of Article 6.

===Withdrawal of 16 Znlwva members===

Ex-ZIPRA cadres officially withdrew their membership from the Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans Association, which was under the administration of ZANU PF. They revived ZIPRA, led by Benny Ncube as chairperson, Tapson Moyo as vice chairperson, Petros Sibanda as secretary, Job Ndlovu as deputy secretary, Belinda Ndebele as treasurer, and committee members are Stanley Ncube and Clement Malaba Ncube. The committee&#x27;s mandate was to set up the association&#x27;s structures in provinces and districts in preparation for the inaugural congress where the substantive executive was to be elected. The association would work closely with the mother party ZAPU.

===National Consultative Convention===
At the party conference, the ZAPU National Consultative Convention, held from 13 to 14 December 2008, Dumiso Dabengwa, a former Home Affairs minister was elected interim chairperson with the mandate to convene a two-day congress starting 11 April 2009. The congress would formally endorse the pullout from ZANU and elect an executive for the party.

===Party Congress of 2009 ===
The party congress of 2009, which was supposed to elect new leadership, took place a month later than scheduled, on 16 May 2009. The congress formally endorsed the party&#x27;s withdrawal from ZANU PF and withdrew support for its former members who had chosen to remain in ZANU. The congress was attended by delegates from the country&#x27;s 10 provinces as well as representatives from Canada, South Africa, Botswana and Swaziland. The party&#x27;s new platform promised to restore &quot;respectable nationhood&quot; where the people were &quot;the pivot around which proper, able and accountable leadership is elected.&quot;

=== Party Congress of 2010 ===
A full Congress was held in August 2010, at which a full policy was agreed and leadership elected with Dumiso Dabengwa as president and Emilia Mukaratirwa as vice-president.

<doc id="411429" wikidata="Q1893466" url="?curid=411429" title="Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)">
<text>Martin Harris (May 18, 1783 – July 10, 1875) was an early convert to the Latter Day Saint movement who financially guaranteed the first printing of the Book of Mormon and also served as one of Three Witnesses who testified that they had seen the golden plates from which Joseph Smith said the Book of Mormon had been translated.

==Early life==
Harris was born in Easton, New York, the second of the eight children born to Nathan Harris and Rhoda Lapham.

According to historian Ronald W. Walker, little is known of his youth. In 1808, Harris married his first cousin Lucy Harris.

Harris served with the 39th regiment of the New York State Militia of Ontario County, New York in the War of 1812. 

Until 1831, Harris lived in Palmyra, New York, where he was a prosperous farmer. Harris&#x27;s neighbors considered him both an honest and superstitious man. A biographer wrote that Harris&#x27;s &quot;imagination was excitable and fecund.&quot; For example, Harris once perceived a sputtering candle to be the work of the devil. An acquaintance said that Harris claimed to have seen Jesus in the shape of a deer and walked and talked with him for two or three miles. The local Presbyterian minister called him &quot;a visionary fanatic.&quot; A friend, who praised Harris as being &quot;universally esteemed as an honest man,&quot; also declared that Harris&#x27;s mind &quot;was overbalanced by &#x27;marvellousness.&#x27;&quot; Another friend said, &quot;Martin was a man that would do just as he agreed with you. But, he was a great man for seeing spooks.&quot; Some Palmyrans, however, remembered Harris as a &#x27;skeptic&#x27; who was &quot;not very religious&quot; before the Book of Mormon. Nevertheless, even early anti-Mormons who knew Harris believed that he was &quot;honest,&quot; &quot;industrious,&quot; &quot;benevolent,&quot; and a &quot;worthy citizen.&quot;

On Harris&#x27;s departure from New York with the Latter Day Saints, the local paper wrote: &quot;Several families, numbering about fifty souls, took up their line of march from this town last week for the &#x27;promised land,&#x27; among whom was Martin Harris, one of the original believers in the &#x27;Book of Mormon.&#x27; Mr. Harris was among the early settlers of this town, and has ever borne the character of an honorable and upright man, and an obliging and benevolent neighbor. He had secured to himself by honest industry a respectable fortune—and he has left a large circle of acquaintances and friends to pity his delusion.&quot;

==Early interaction with Smith==

The Smith family moved to Palmyra in 1816, and in 1824, Harris employed Joseph Smith Sr., to dig a well and a cistern. Smith Sr. reportedly told Harris about the gold plates in 1824. Harris later recounted the first time he saw Joseph Smith use a seer stone, when the latter used it to locate a lost object for Harris.

===Role in Anthon transcript===
Because Harris wanted assurance of the Book of Mormon&#x27;s authenticity, Smith transcribed characters from the golden plates to a piece of paper, perhaps the one now known as the Anthon transcript, but there is much to cast doubt on this document being the original as both Harris&#x27;s and Anthon&#x27;s accounts describe it differently. In the winter of 1828, Harris took the transcript of characters to New York City, where he met with Charles Anthon, a professor of linguistics at Columbia College. The two men&#x27;s accounts of the meeting conflict on almost every point. Harris&#x27;s account is recorded in Smith&#x27;s &quot;History of the Church&quot;. According to the account, Harris said that Anthon gave him a certificate verifying the authenticity of the characters and the translations, but that when Anthon learned that Smith claimed to have received the plates from an angel, he took the certificate back and tore it to pieces. Anthon, for his part, gave written accounts in 1834 and 1841. Despite the years in between, both accounts are in good agreement, but there is a contradiction as to whether he had given Harris a written opinion about the transcript or not. In both accounts, Anthon maintained that he told Harris that he (Harris) was a victim of a fraud and not to get involved. In either case, the episode apparently satisfied Harris&#x27;s doubts about the authenticity of the golden plates and the translation enough to mortgage his farm to have the book printed. Harris&#x27;s wife continued to oppose his collaboration with Smith.

In both of Anthon&#x27;s accounts, he states that Harris visited him again after the Book of Mormon was printed and brought him a copy, which Anthon refused to accept. Anthon records that he again advised Harris he had been defrauded and should go straight home and ask to examine the plates locked in the chest, but Harris responded that he could not look at the plates or he and his family would be cursed.

===Scribe to Joseph Smith===

In February 1828, Harris traveled to Harmony, Pennsylvania to serve as a scribe while Smith dictated the translation of the golden plates. By June 1828, Smith and Harris&#x27;s work on the translation had resulted in 116 pages of manuscript.

Harris asked Smith for permission to take the 116 pages of manuscript back to his wife to convince her of its authenticity; Smith reluctantly agreed. After Harris had shown the pages to his wife and some others, the manuscript disappeared. The loss temporarily halted the translation of the plates, and when Smith began again, he used other scribes, primarily Oliver Cowdery.

The first extant written revelation to Joseph Smith, dated July 1828, refers to Smith&#x27;s delivering the 116 pages to Harris. Addressing Smith, the revelation says: &quot;thou deliveredst up that which was sacred, into the hands of a wicked man, who has set at nought the counsels of God, and has broken the most sacred promises, which were made before God, and has depended upon his own judgement, and boasted in his own wisdom.&quot;

===Book of Mormon financier===
Nevertheless, Harris continued to support Smith financially. The translation was completed in June 1829. By August, Smith contracted with publisher E. B. Grandin of Palmyra to print the Book of Mormon. Harris mortgaged his farm to Grandin to ensure payment of the printing costs, and he later sold of his farm to pay off the mortgage. In March 1830, Smith announced a revelation to Harris: &quot;I command you, that thou shalt not covet thine own property, but impart freely to the printing of the book of Mormon.&quot; He warned, &quot;Misery thou shalt receive, if thou wilt slight these counsels: Yea, even destruction of thyself and property. Impart a portion of thy property; Yea, even a part of thy lands and all save the support of thy family. Pay the printer&#x27;s debt.&quot;

===Witness to the golden plates===

As the translation neared completion, Joseph Smith said he received a revelation from God that three men would be called as special witnesses to the existence of the golden plates. Harris, along with Oliver Cowdery and David Whitmer, was chosen as one of the Three Witnesses.

In the words of David Whitmer, one of the other two witnesses, &quot;It was in the latter part of June, 1829... Joseph, Oliver Cowdery and myself were together, and the angel showed them [the plates] to us... [We were] sitting on a log when we were overshadowed by a light more glorious than that of the sun. In the midst of this light, but a few feet from us, appeared a table upon which were many golden plates, also the sword of Laban and the directors. I saw them as plain as I see you now, and distinctly heard the voice of the Lord declaring that the records of the plates of the Book of Mormon were translated by the gift and power of God.&quot;

Joseph Smith and Martin Harris had a similar experience, and as the manuscript was prepared for printing, Cowdery, Whitmer, and Harris signed a joint statement that has been included in each of the more than 120 million copies of the Book of Mormon printed since then. It reads in part:

&quot;And we declare with words of soberness, that an angel of God came down from heaven, and he brought and laid before our eyes, that we beheld and saw the plates, and the engravings thereon; and we know that it is by the grace of God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, that we beheld and bear record that these things are true.&quot;

In 1839, Smith indicated that Harris&#x27;s experience in seeing the plates occurred separately from that of Whitmer and Cowdery. The Three Witnesses&#x27;s attestation was printed with the book, and it has been included in nearly every subsequent edition.

===Marital conflict===
In part because of their continued disagreement over the legitimacy of Smith and the golden plates, and because of the loss of his farm, Harris and his wife separated. Lucy Harris was described by Lucy Mack Smith as having an &quot;irascible temper.&quot; Lucy Harris wrote that Martin Harris had beaten her &quot;at different times.&quot; She is the only known source of the claim that her husband may have committed adultery with a neighboring &quot;Mrs. Haggard.&quot;

==High Priest==
Harris became an early member of the Church of Christ, which Smith organized on April 6, 1830.

In 1830, Harris prophesied, &#x27;&quot;Jackson would be the last president that we would have; and that all persons who did not embrace Mormonism in two years&#x27; time would be stricken off the face of the earth.&#x27; He said that Palmyra was to be the New Jerusalem, and that her streets were to be paved with gold.&quot;.

On June 3, 1831, at a conference at the headquarters of the church in Kirtland, Ohio, Harris was ordained to the office of high priest and served as a missionary in the Midwest, Pennsylvania, and New York.

On February 12, 1834, Sidney Rigdon charged Harris before the Kirtland High Council, then the chief judicial and legislative council of the church. Among the charges was the allegation that Harris had &quot;told Edqr. A.C. Russell that Joseph drank too much liquor when he was translating the Book of Mormon and that he wrestled with many men and threw them &amp;c. Another charge was, that he exalted himself above Bro. Joseph, in that he said bro. Joseph knew not the contents of the Book of Mormon until after it was translated.&quot; Harris reportedly admitted that he &quot;had said many things inadvertently calculating to wound the feelings of his brother and promised to do better. The council forgave him and gave him much good advice.&quot;

On February 17, 1834, Harris was ordained a member of Kirtland High Council. In response to the conflicts between Mormons and non-Mormons in Missouri, Harris joined what is now known as Zion&#x27;s Camp and marched from Kirtland to Clay County, Missouri. Afterwards, Harris, along with Oliver Cowdery and David Whitmer, selected and ordained a &quot;traveling High Council&quot; of 12 men that eventually became the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. (Some early church leaders claimed that Harris, like Smith and Cowdery, was ordained to the priesthood office of apostle; but there is no record of this ordination, and neither Harris nor Cowdery was ever a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.)

===Marriage to Caroline Young===
Lucy Harris died in the summer of 1836, and on November 1, 1836, Harris married Caroline Young, the 22-year-old daughter of Brigham Young&#x27;s brother, John. Harris was 31 years older than his new wife; they had seven children together.

==Split with Joseph Smith==
In 1837, dissension arose in Kirtland over the failure of the church&#x27;s Kirtland Safety Society bank. Harris called it a &quot;fraud&quot; and was among the dissenters who broke with Smith and attempted to reorganize the church, led by Warren Parrish. Smith and Rigdon relocated to Far West, Missouri. In December 1837, Smith and the Kirtland High Council excommunicated 28 individuals, Harris among them.

In 1838, Smith called the Three Witnesses (Cowdery, Harris, and Whitmer) &quot;too mean to mention; and we had liked to have forgotten them.&quot; Parrish&#x27;s church in Kirtland took control of the temple and became known as &quot;The Church of Christ&quot;. In its 1838 articles of incorporation, Harris was named one of the church&#x27;s three trustees.

Reports indicate that during this period, Harris increasingly witnessed that his vision of the golden plates was with the spiritual eye, not the natural eye.

In June 1841, the &quot;Painesville Telegraph&quot; reported, &quot;Martin Harris believes that the work in its commencement was a genuine work of the Lord, but that Smith, having become worldly and proud, has been forsaken of the Lord, and has become a knave and impostor. He expects that the work will be yet revived, through other instrumentalities.&quot;

Harris was rebaptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in 1842, though he did not gather with church members to its headquarters in Nauvoo, Illinois.

===Strangite, Whitmerite, Gladdenite, Williamite, Shaker===

According to residents of Palmyra, Harris had earlier changed his religion several times, though Harris himself claimed never to have joined a church before he became a Mormon. After the killing of Joseph Smith, Harris remained in Kirtland and accepted James Strang as Mormonism&#x27;s new prophet, one who claimed to have another set of supernatural plates and witnesses to authenticate them. In August 1846, Harris traveled on a mission to England for the Strangite church, but the Mormon conference there declined to hear him. When he insisted on preaching outside the building, police removed him.

By 1847, Harris had broken with Strang and accepted the leadership claims of fellow Book of Mormon witness David Whitmer. Mormon apostle William E. McLellin organized a Whitmerite congregation in Kirtland, and Harris became a member. By 1851, Harris had accepted another Latter Day Saint factional leader, Gladden Bishop, as prophet and joined Bishop&#x27;s Kirtland-based organization. In 1855, Harris joined with the last surviving brother of Joseph Smith, William Smith and declared that William was Joseph&#x27;s true successor. Harris was also briefly intrigued by the &quot;Roll and Book,&quot; a scripture that had been supernaturally delivered to the Shakers. By the 1860s, all of those organizations had either dissolved or declined. In 1856, his wife left him to gather with the Mormons in Utah Territory while he remained in Kirtland and gave tours of the temple to curious visitors.

In 1859, Harris gave an interview which described him as &quot;an earnest and sincere advocate of the spiritual and divine authority of the Book of Mormon.&quot; It clarified that Harris &quot;does not sympathize with Brigham Young and the Salt Lake Church. He considers them apostates from the true faith; and as being under the influence of the devil. Mr. Harris says, that the pretended church of the &#x27;Latter Day Saints,&#x27; are in reality &#x27;latter day devils,&#x27; and that himself and a very few others are the only genuine Mormons left.&quot;

==Rebaptism into LDS Church==

In 1870, at age 87, Harris moved to the Utah Territory, and, shortly afterward, was again rebaptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Harris, who had been left destitute and without a congregation in Kirtland, accepted the assistance of members of the LDS Church, who raised $200 () to help him move west. Harris lived the last four and a half years of his life with relatives in Cache Valley. He died on July 10, 1875, in Clarkston, Utah Territory, and was buried there.

==Testimony to the Book of Mormon==
Although he was estranged from Mormon leaders for most of his life, Harris continued to testify to the truth of the Book of Mormon. His initial written testimony as one of the three witnesses, printed in the Book of Mormon, describes a physical experience. He then often describes seeing the plates using spiritual language, and finally returns to primarily using physical or natural terminology.

===Spiritual testimony===
Primarily during the early years, Harris &quot;seems to have repeatedly admitted the internal, subjective nature of his visionary experience.&quot; The foreman in the Palmyra printing office that produced the first Book of Mormon said that Harris &quot;used to practice a good deal of his characteristic jargon and &#x27;seeing with the spiritual eye,&#x27; and the like.&quot; John H. Gilbert, the typesetter for most of the book, said that he had asked Harris, &quot;Martin, did you see those plates with your naked eyes?&quot; According to Gilbert, Harris &quot;looked down for an instant, raised his eyes up, and said, &#x27;No, I saw them with a spiritual eye.&#x27;&quot; Two other Palmyra residents said that Harris told them that he had seen the plates with &quot;the eye of faith&quot; or &quot;spiritual eyes.&quot;

In March 1838, disillusioned church members said that Harris had publicly denied that any of the Witnesses to the &quot;Book of Mormon&quot; had ever seen or handled the golden plates—although Harris had not been present when Whitmer and Cowdery first said they had viewed them—and they stated that Harris&#x27;s recantation, made during a period of crisis in early Mormonism, induced five influential members, including three apostles, to leave the church.

In April 1838, Harris is reported by one disillusioned church member to have said publicly in Ohio that &quot;he never saw the plates with his natural eyes, only in vision or imagination.&quot; A neighbor of Harris in Kirtland, Ohio, said decades later that Harris &quot;never claimed to have seen [the plates] with his natural eyes, only spiritual vision.&quot;

One account written years after Harris&#x27;s death reports Harris at the end of his long life saying &quot;Sometimes the plates would be on a table in the room in which Smith did the translating, covered over with cloth,&quot; but also that &quot;While praying I passed into a state of entrancement, and in that state I saw the angel and the plates.&quot;

===Physical testimony===
Harris later returns to increasingly using physical, rather than spiritual descriptions of his witness of the plates. Even during his 1838 disillusionment, he corrected other dissenters regarding his physical witness of the plates: &quot;Harris arose &amp; said he was sorry for any man who rejected the Book of Mormon for he knew it was true, he said he had hefted the plates repeatedly in a box with only a tablecloth or a handkerchief over them&quot;.

In 1853, Harris told David Dille that he had held the forty- to sixty-pound plates on his knee for &quot;an hour-and-a-half&quot; and handled the plates with his hands, &quot;plate after plate.&quot; Even later, Harris affirmed that he had seen the plates and the angel: &quot;Gentlemen,&quot; holding out his hand, &quot;do you see that hand? Are you sure you see it? Or are your eyes playing you a trick or something? No. Well, as sure as you see my hand so sure did I see the Angel and the plates.&quot; The following year Harris affirmed that &quot;No man heard me in any way deny the truth of the Book of Mormon [or] the administration of the angel that showed me the plates.&quot;

At the end of his life, Harris responded when he was asked if he still believed in Smith and the Book of Mormon: &quot;Do I believe it! Do you see the sun shining! Just as surely as the sun is shining on us and gives us light, and the [moon] and stars give us light by night, just as surely as the breath of life sustains us, so surely do I know that Joseph Smith was a true prophet of God, chosen of God to open the last dispensation of the fulness of times; so surely do I know that the Book of Mormon was divinely translated. I saw the plates; I saw the Angel; I heard the voice of God. I know that the Book of Mormon is true and that Joseph Smith was a true prophet of God. I might as well doubt my own existence as to doubt the divine authenticity of the Book of Mormon or the divine calling of Joseph Smith.&quot;

On his death bed, Harris said: &quot;The Book of Mormon is no fake. I know what I know. I have seen what I have seen and I have heard what I have heard. I have seen the gold plates from which the Book of Mormon is written. An angel appeared to me and others and testified to the truthfulness of the record, and had I been willing to have perjured myself and sworn falsely to the testimony I now bear I could have been a rich man, but I could not have testified other than I have done and am now doing for these things are true.&quot;

<text>Sir Thomas Stanley (1625 – 12 April 1678) was an English author and translator.

==Life==
He was born in Cumberlow, Hertfordshire, the son of Sir Thomas Stanley of Cumberlow and his wife, Mary Hammond. Mary was the cousin of Richard Lovelace, and Stanley was educated in company with the son of Edward Fairfax, the translator of Tasso. He proceeded to Cambridge in 1637, in his thirteenth year, as a gentleman commoner of Pembroke Hall. In 1641, he took his M.A. degree, but seems by that time to have proceeded to Oxford. He subsequently embarked on a legal career, entering the Middle Temple in 1664 to study law.

He was wealthy, married early, and travelled much in Europe. He was the friend and companion, and at need the helper, of many poets, and was himself both a writer and a translator of verse. His portrait was painted by Sir Peter Lely and by Sir Godfrey Kneller; in all he was painted at least fifteen times.

==Writing==
Stanley is the last of the metaphysical poets; born into a later generation than that of Edmund Waller and John Denham, he rejected their influence in prosody and forms of fancy. He admired Moschus, Ausonius, and the &quot;Pervigilium Veneris&quot;; among the moderns, Joannes Secundus, Góngora and Giambattista Marino.

Stanley&#x27;s major work was &quot;The History of Philosophy&quot;, a series of critical biographies of philosophers, beginning with Thales; the life of Socrates included a blank verse translation of &quot;The Clouds of Aristophanes.&quot; It appeared in three volumes between 1655 and 1661. A fourth volume (1662), bearing the title of &quot;The History of Chaldaick Philosophy&quot;, was translated into Latin by Jean Le Clerc (Amsterdam, 1690). The three earlier volumes were published in an enlarged Latin version by Gottfried Olearius (Leipzig, 1711). In 1664 Stanley published in folio a monumental edition of the text of Aeschylus. Richard Bentley is said to have appreciated his scholarship, and to have made use of Stanley&#x27;s notes, on Callimachus.

==Works==

*&quot;Poems&quot; (1647)
*&quot;Aurora and the Prince&quot;, from the Spanish of Juan Pérez de Montalbán; with &quot;Oronta, the Cyprian Virgin&quot;, from the Italian of Girolamo Preti (1647)
*Europa, Cupid Crucified, Venus Vigils (1649)
*Anacreon; Bion; Moschus; Kisses by Secundus...&quot;, a volume of translations (1651)
*&quot;The History of Philosophy&quot; (London, Humphrey Moseley and Thomas Dring) in 1655, three volumes, (1655, 1656, 1660); a fourth was published in 1662.
*&quot;Psalterium Carolinum: The Devotions of His Sacred Majestie in His Solitudes And Sufferings&quot; (1657), a verse rendering of the &quot;Eikon Basilike&quot; with music by John Wilson.
*&quot;Poems&quot; (1814) edited by Samuel Egerton Brydges
*&quot;Anacreon&quot; (1883) translation, edited by A. H. Bullen (with Greek original)

==Family and death==
Stanley&#x27;s first wife was Dorothy Emyon, daughter and coheir of Sir James Emyon, of Flore, Northamptonshire, with issue Thomas Stanley (1650 – death unknown).

After Dorothy&#x27;s death, Stanley married Catherine Killigrew, with no issue. He died at his lodgings in Suffolk Street, Strand, London on 12 April 1678, and was buried in the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields. His widow died in Cumberlow in 1689.

<doc id="411434" wikidata="Q213541" url="?curid=411434" title="Concordat">
<text>A concordat () is a convention between the Holy See and a sovereign state that defines the relationship between the Catholic Church and the state in matters that concern both, i.e. the recognition and privileges of the Catholic Church in a particular country and with secular matters that affect church interests.

According to P. W. Brown the use of the term &quot;concordat&quot; does not appear &quot;until the pontificate of Pope Martin V (1413–1431) in a work by Nicholas de Cusa, entitled &quot;De Concordantia Catholica&quot;. The first concordat dates from 1098, and from then to the beginning of the First World War the Holy See signed 74 concordats. Due to the substantial remapping of Europe that took place after the war, new concordats with legal successor states were necessary. The post–World War I era saw the greatest proliferation of concordats in history.

Although for a time after the Second Vatican Council, which ended in 1965, the term &#x27;concordat&#x27; was dropped, it reappeared with the Polish Concordat of 1993 and the Portuguese Concordat of 2004. A different mode of relations between the Vatican and various states is still evolving, often contentiously, in the wake of a growing secularism and religious pluralism in the western world.

==Church teaching ==

The Catholic Church historically claimed not to be bound to one form of government over another, but was willing to work with any kind of government, so long as the rights of God and believers were maintained. Pius XI wrote in 1933: Universally known is the fact that the Catholic Church is never bound to one form of government more than to another, provided the Divine rights of God and of Christian consciences are safe. She does not find any difficulty in adapting herself to various civil institutions, be they monarchic or republican, aristocratic or democratic.

==Church–state dichotomy ==

From a church–state perspective, the contentions regarding concordats involves two perspectives.

From a Catholic perspective, the Church has the moral and theological right to enter into diplomatic relations with states in order to reach agreements regarding the care of its members residing there. This is the concept of &quot;Libertas ecclesiae&quot; (freedom of the Church).

From a non-Catholic perspective, concordats may pose certain concerns such as:
* concordats may not be &quot;the same as treaties&quot; because they are entered into by an entity that is both religious and political in nature, viz., the Catholic Church, with exception to states which are expressly atheist or are identified as choosing anti-religious views, whereas any other treaty is regularly between two sovereign entities on a horizontal level, i.e., purely political in nature, and
* depending on the negotiations agreed upon in the concordat, non-Catholic religious groups face the threat of being marginalized. For example, in Spain, although the Constitution guarantees religious freedom, the Catholic Church is mentioned by name, and in practice holds a pre-eminent position among other religious groups. In recent years, debate has occurred regarding whether the Spanish government should maintain a concordat with the Vatican.

Due to these concerns, the United States did not establish diplomatic ties to the Vatican until the Ronald Reagan administration in 1984; and, to this day, the United States does not have a concordat with the Vatican, despite the two having a mutual &quot;compromise&quot; in terms of relationship.

==Examples of concordats==

* The Concordat of 1801 was an agreement between Napoleon and Pope Pius VII. During the French Revolution, the National Assembly had taken Church properties and issued the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. Subsequent laws abolished Christian holidays. Many religious leaders had either gone into exile or been executed during the Reign of Terror. The Church gave up any claims to lands confiscated after 1790, but secured the right to public worship, subject to any public safety concerns on the part of the local prefect. Napoleon was able to pacify French Catholics, while limiting the papacy&#x27;s influence in France. While the concordat restored some ties to the papacy, it largely favored the state. Within a year Napoleon unilaterally amended the agreement with the Organic Articles legislating religious practice.

Some concordats guarantee the Catholic Church the tax-exempt status of a charity, being by fact the largest charitable institution in the world, either stating this explicitly, as in Brazil (2008, Article 15) and Italy (1984, Article 7.3), or phrasing it indirectly, as in Portugal (2004, art. 12).
When the political will is present, such concordat privileges can be extended by domestic legislation. In 1992, the tax exemption granted the Church by the Italian concordat was interpreted by a law which permits the Catholic Church to avoid paying 90% of what it owes to the state for its commercial activities. Thus, a small shrine within the walls of a cinema, holiday resort, shop, restaurant or hotel is sufficient to confer religious exemption. In June 2007 Neelie Kroes, the European Commissioner for Competition announced an investigation of this. Then, in August, the deputy finance minister in Romano Prodi&#x27;s fragile center-left coalition said the issue needed to be tackled in the next year&#x27;s budget. However, after that nothing more about this was heard from the Barroso Commission and a few months later the Prodi government fell.

The Slovak concordat (2000, art. 20.2) ensures that church offertories are &quot;not subject to taxation or to the requirement of public accountability&quot;.

This is also the case in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, where far larger sums are involved. The Basilica at Yamoussoukro, is estimated to have cost $300 million, and the additional running expenses for what is the largest church in the world are also shielded from scrutiny by the 1992 concordat concluded with the Ivorian president. Houphouët-Boigny claimed that these funds came from his private fortune. A Vatican official is reported to have called the agreement over the foundation set up to administer these funds &quot;a delicate matter&quot;. Nevertheless, this concordat ensures that the foundation&#x27;s income and assets remain untaxed (art. 9.1), it holds these funds beyond the reach of both criminal and civil law (art. 7.1), it permits this money to be sent out of the country (art. 13.2) and it keeps all the foundation&#x27;s documents &quot;inviolable&quot;, in other words, secret (art. 8).

In Colombia there was a crisis between state and church in 1994 when Attorney-General Gustavo de Greiff accused several bishops of having illegal contacts with the FARC guerrillas. It turned out that under Colombia&#x27;s concordat with the Holy See, members of the clergy could only be investigated by ecclesiastical courts which are ruled by canon law, and that the bishops were therefore immune from investigation by the civil authorities on what many in Colombia considered to be a serious felony.

==List==
There have been at least several hundred concordats over the centuries.
The following is a sortable list of the concordats and other bilateral agreements concluded by the Holy See.

<text>Gallicanism is the belief that popular secular authority—often represented by the monarch&#x27;s or the state&#x27;s authority—over the Catholic Church is comparable to that of the pope. Gallicanism is a rejection of ultramontanism; it has something in common with Anglicanism, but is nuanced, in that it plays down the authority of the Pope in church without denying that there are some authoritative elements to the office associated with being (&#x27;first among equals&#x27;). Other terms for the same or similar doctrines include Erastianism, Regalism, Febronianism, and Josephinism.

Gallicanism originated in France (the term derives from , the Latin name of Gaul), and is unrelated to the first-millennium Catholic Gallican Rite. In the 18th century, it spread to the Low Countries, especially the Netherlands. The University of Notre Dame professor John McGreevy defines it as &quot;the notion that national customs might trump Roman (Catholic Church) regulations.&quot;

==Background==
Gallicanism is a group of religious opinions that was for some time peculiar to the Catholic Church in France. These opinions were in opposition to the ideas which were called &quot;ultramontane&quot;, which means &quot;across the mountains&quot; (the Alps). Ultramontanism affirmed the authority of the pope over the temporal kingdoms of the rest of Europe, particularly emphasizing a supreme episcopate for the pope holding universal immediate jurisdiction. This eventually led to the definition by the Roman Catholic Church of the dogma of papal infallibility at the First Vatican Council.

Gallicanism tended to restrain the pope&#x27;s authority in favour of that of bishops and the people&#x27;s representatives in the State, or the monarch. But the most respected proponents of Gallican ideas did not contest the pope&#x27;s primacy in the Church, merely his supremacy and doctrinal infallibility. They believed their way of regarding the authority of the pope—more in line with that of the Conciliar movement and akin to the Orthodox and Anglicans—was more in conformity with Holy Scripture and tradition. At the same time, they believed their theory did not transgress the limits of free opinions.

==General notions==
The &quot;Declaration of the Clergy of France&quot; of 1682 is made up of four articles:

#St. Peter and the popes, his successors, and the Church itself have dominion from God only over things spiritual and not over things temporal and civil. Therefore, kings and sovereigns are not beholden to the church in deciding temporal things. They cannot be deposed by the church and their subjects cannot be absolved by the church from their oaths of allegiance.
#The authority in things spiritual belongs to the Holy See and the successors of St. Peter, and does not affect the decrees of the Council of Constance contained in the fourth and fifth sessions of that council, which is observed by the Gallican Church. The Gallicans do not approve of casting slurs on those decrees.
#The exercise of this Apostolic authority (puissance) must be regulated in accordance with canons (rules) established by the Holy Spirit through the centuries of Church history.
# Although the pope has the chief part in questions of faith, and his decrees apply to all the Churches, and to each Church in particular, yet his judgment is not irreformable, at least pending the consent of the Church.

According to the initial Gallican theory, then, papal primacy was limited first by the temporal power of monarchs, which, by divine will, was inviolable. Secondly, it was limited by the authority of the general councils and the bishops, and lastly by the canons and customs of particular churches, which the pope was bound to take into account when he exercised his authority.

Gallicanism was more than pure theory – the bishops and magistrates of France used it, the former to increase power in the government of dioceses, the latter to extend their jurisdiction so as to cover ecclesiastical affairs. There also was an episcopal and political Gallicanism, and a parliamentary or judicial Gallicanism. The former lessened the doctrinal authority of the pope in favour of that of the bishops, to the degree marked by the Declaration of 1682, and the latter augmented the rights of the state.

There were eighty-three &quot;Liberties of the Gallican Church&quot;, according to a collection drawn up by the jurisconsults Guy Coquille and Pierre Pithou. Besides the four articles cited above, which were incorporated, these Liberties included the following:
*The Kings of France had the right to assemble councils in their dominions, and to make laws and regulations touching ecclesiastical matters.
*The pope&#x27;s legates could not be sent into France, or exercise their power within that kingdom, except at the king&#x27;s request or with his consent.
*Bishops, even when commanded by the pope, could not go out of the kingdom without the king&#x27;s consent.
*Royal officers could not be excommunicated for any act performed in the discharge of their official duties.
*The pope could not authorize the alienation of any landed estate of the Churches, or the diminishing of any foundations.
*His bulls and letters might not be executed without the &quot;pareatis&quot; of the king or his officers.
*He could not issue dispensations to the prejudice of the laudable customs and statutes of the cathedral Churches.
*It was lawful to appeal from him to a future council, or to have recourse to the &quot;appeal as from an abuse&quot; against acts of the ecclesiastical power.

Parliamentary Gallicanism, therefore, was of much wider scope than episcopal; indeed, it was often disavowed by the bishops of France, and about twenty of them condemned Pierre Pithou&#x27;s book when a new edition of it was published, in 1638, by the brothers Dupuy.

==History==
John Kilcullen wrote, in the &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot;, that &quot;in France conciliarism was one of the sources of Gallicanism.&quot;

Proponents of Gallicanism presented a number of theories as to its origin.

* The more moderate held that Gallican ideas and liberties were simply privileges – concessions made by the popes, who had been quite willing to divest themselves of a part of their authority in favour of the bishops or kings of France. Thus the extension of the king&#x27;s authority ecclesiastical matters was not new. This idea appeared as early as the reign of King Philip IV, in some of the protests of that monarch against the policy of Pope Boniface VIII. In the view of some partisans of the theory, the popes had always thought fit to show special consideration for the ancient customs of the Gallican Church, which in every age had distinguished itself by its exactitude in the preservation of the Faith and the maintenance of ecclesiastical discipline.
* Others dated the Gallican approach to the time of the early Carolingians, and explaining them somewhat differently, when the popes found it necessary to delegate certain prerogatives to the king in order that some control be exerted on the Frankish nobles who had taken possession of episcopal sees. The popes had, therefore, granted to Carloman, Pepin, and Charlemagne a spiritual authority which they were to exercise only under papal control; which authority had been inherited by their successors, the Kings of France.

The majority of Gallicans rejected the first theory that described the Gallican liberties as time-honored privileges, since a privilege can always be revoked by the authority which granted it. This was unacceptable, as they maintained that the pope had no power to revoke them. The Ultramontanes pointed out that in that case, such liberties would also be claimed by the German emperors, also heirs of Charlemagne, and that was not the case. Moreover, some privileges the pope cannot grant, such as allowing any kings the privilege of suppressing or curtailing his liberty of communicating with the faithful in a particular territory.

Most of its partisans regarded Gallicanism as a revival of the most ancient traditions of Christianity, found in the conciliar decrees of the earliest centuries or in canon laws of the general and local councils, and the decretals, ancient and modern, which were received in France. &quot;Of all Christian countries&quot;, says Fleury, &quot;France has been the most careful to conserve the liberty of her Church and oppose the novelties introduced by Ultramontane canonists&quot;. They argued that the popes had extended to their own primacy based upon the false Decretals rather than Divine law. What the Gallicans maintained in 1682 was said to be not a collection of novelties, but a body of beliefs as old as the Church, the discipline of the first centuries. The Church of France had upheld and practised them at all times; the Church Universal had believed and practised them in the past, until about the tenth century; St. Louis had supported, but not created, them by the Pragmatic Sanction; the Council of Constance had taught them with the pope&#x27;s approbation. Gallican ideas, then, must have had no other origin than that of Christian dogma and ecclesiastical discipline.

=== The early Middle Ages ===

To the similarity of the historical vicissitudes through which they passed, their common political allegiance, and the early appearance of a national sentiment, the Churches of France owed it that they very soon formed an individual, compact, and homogeneous body. From the end of the fourth century the popes themselves recognized this solidarity. It was to the &quot;Gallican&quot; bishops that Pope Damasus I addressed the most ancient decretal which has been preserved to our times (Babut 1904). Two centuries later St. Gregory the Great pointed out the Gallican Church to his envoy Augustine, the Apostle of England, as one of those whose customs he might accept as of equal stability with those of the Roman Church or of any other whatsoever. But already (if we credit Babut&#x27;s findings) a Council of Turin, at which bishops of the Gauls took part, had given the first manifestation of Gallican sentiment. Unfortunately for Babut&#x27;s thesis, all the significance which he attaches to this council depends upon the date, 417, ascribed to it by him, on the mere strength of a personal conjecture, in opposition to the most competent historians. Besides, it is not at all plain how a council of the Province of Milan is to be taken as representing the ideas of the Gallican Church.

In truth, that Church, during the Merovingian period, testifies the same deference to the Holy See as do all the others. Ordinary questions of discipline are in the ordinary course settled in councils, often held with the assent of the kings, but on great occasions – the Council of Epaone (517),Valence (528), Vaison (529), Orléans (538), Tours (567) – the bishops declare that they are acting under the impulse of the Holy See, or defer to its admonitions; they take pride in the approbation of the pope; they cause his name to be read aloud in the churches, just as is done in Italy and in Africa they cite his decretals as a source of canon law; they show indignation at the mere idea that anyone should fail in consideration for them. Bishops condemned in councils (like Salonius of Embrun, Sagittarius of Gap, Contumeliosus of Riez) have no difficulty in appealing to the pope, who, after examination, either confirms or rectifies the sentence pronounced against them.

=== From Pepin to the Reformation ===
The accession of the Carolingian dynasty is marked by a splendid act of homage paid in France to the power of the papacy: before assuming the title of king, Pepin made the point of securing the assent of Pope Zachary. Without exaggerating the significance of this act, the bearing of which the Gallicans have done every thing to minimize, one may still see it as evidence that, even before Gregory VII, public opinion in France was not hostile to the intervention of the pope in political affairs. From that time on, the advances of the Roman primacy find no serious opponents in France before Hincmar, Archbishop of Reims. With him there appears the idea that the pope must limit his activity to ecclesiastical matters, and not intrude in those pertaining to the State, which concern kings only; that his supremacy is bound to respect the prescriptions of the ancient canons and the privileges of the Churches; and that his decretals must not be placed upon the same footing as the canons of the councils. His attitude stands out as isolated. The Council of Troyes (867) proclaims that no bishop can be deposed without reference to the Holy See, and the Council of Douzy (871) condemns Hincmar of Laon only under reserve of the rights of the pope.

With the first Capets the secular relations between the pope and the Gallican Church appeared to be momentarily strained. At the Councils of Saint-Basle de Verzy (991) and of Chelles (c. 993), in the discourses of Arnoul, Bishop of Orléans, in the letters of Gerbert, afterwards Pope Sylvester II, sentiments of violent hostility to the Holy See are manifested, and an evident determination to elude the authority in matters of discipline which had until then been recognized as belonging to it. But the papacy at that period, given over to the tyranny of Crescentius and other local barons, was in a period of temporary decline. When it regained its independence, its old authority in France came back to it, the work of the Councils of Saint-Basle and of Chelles was undone; princes like Hugh Capet, bishops like Gerbert, held no attitude but that of submission. It has been said that during the early Capetian period the pope was more powerful in France than he had ever been. Under Gregory VII the pope&#x27;s legates traversed France from north to south, they convoked and presided over numerous councils, and, in spite of sporadic and incoherent acts of resistance, they deposed bishops and excommunicated princes just as in Germany and Spain.

In the following two centuries we can still see no clear evidence of Gallicanism. The pontifical power attains its apogee in France as elsewhere, St. Bernard and St. Thomas Aquinas outline the theory of that power, and their opinion is that of the school in accepting the attitude of Gregory VII and his successors in regard to delinquent princes. St. Louis IX, whom some tried to represent as a patron of the Gallican system, is still ignorant of it – for the fact is now established that the Pragmatic Sanction of 1269, long attributed to him, was a wholesale fabrication put together (about 1445) in the purlieus of the Royal Chancellery of Charles VII to lend countenance to the Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges. (Löffler 1911)

At the opening of the fourteenth century, however, the conflict between Philip IV and Boniface VIII brought out the first glimmerings of the Gallican ideas. That king did not confine himself to maintaining that, as sovereign, he was the sole and independent master of his temporalities; he proclaimed that, in virtue of the concession made by the pope, with the assent of a general council to Charlemagne and his successors, he had the right to dispose of vacant ecclesiastical benefices. With the consent of the nobility, the Third Estate, and a great part of the clergy, he appealed in the matter from Boniface VIII to a future general council – the implication being that the council is superior to the pope. The same ideas and others still more hostile to the Holy See reappeared in the struggle of Fratricelles and Louis of Bavaria against Pope John XXII; they were expressed by the pens of William of Occam, of John of Jandun, and of Marsilius of Padua, professors in the University of Paris. Among other things, they denied the divine origin of the papal primacy, and subject the exercise of it to the good pleasure of the temporal ruler. Following the pope, the University of Paris condemned these views; but for all that they did not entirely disappear from the memory, or from the disputations, of the schools, for the principal work of Marsilius, &quot;Defensor Pacis&quot;, was translated into French in 1375, probably by a professor of the University of Paris. The Western Schism reawakened them suddenly.

The idea of a council naturally suggested itself as a means of healing that unfortunate division of Christendom. Upon that idea was soon grafted the conciliary theory, which sets the council above the pope, making it the sole representative of the Church, the sole organ of infallibility. Timidly sketched by two professors of the University of Paris, Conrad of Gelnhausen and Henry of Langenstein, this theory was completed and noisily interpreted to the public by Pierre d&#x27;Ailly and Gerson. At the same time the clergy of France, disgusted with Benedict XIII, withdrew from his obedience. It was in the assembly which voted on this measure (1398) that for the first time there was any question of bringing back the Church of France to its ancient liberties and customs – of giving its prelates once more the right of conferring and disposing of benefices. The same idea comes into the foreground in the claims put forward in 1406 by another assembly of the French clergy; to win the votes of the assembly, certain orators cited the example of what was happening in England. Johannes Haller concluded from this that these so-called Ancient Liberties were of English origin, that the Gallican Church really borrowed them from its neighbour, only imagining them to be a revival of its own past. This opinion does not seem well founded. The precedents cited by Haller go back to the parliament held at Carlisle in 1307, at which date the tendencies of reaction against papal reservations had already manifested themselves in the assemblies convoked by Philip the Fair in 1302 and 1303. The most that we can admit is, that the same ideas received parallel development from both sides of the channel.

Together with the restoration of the &quot;Ancient Liberties&quot; the assembly of the clergy in 1406 intended to maintain the superiority of the council to the pope, and the fallibility of the latter. However widely they may have been accepted at the time, these were only individual opinions or opinions of a school, when the Council of Constance came to give them the sanction of its high authority. In its fourth and fifth sessions it declared that the council represented the Church and that every person, no matter of what dignity, even the pope, was bound to obey it in what concerned the extirpation of the schism and the reform of the Church; that even the pope, if he resisted obstinately, might be constrained by process of law to obey it in the above-mentioned points. This was the birth or, if we prefer to call it so, the legitimation of Gallicanism. So far we had encountered in the history of the Gallican Church recriminations of malcontent bishops, or a violent gesture of some prince discomforted in his avaricious designs; but these were only fits of resentment or ill humor, accidents with no attendant consequences; this time the provisions made against exercise of the pontifical authority had a lasting effect. Gallicanism had implanted itself in the minds of men as a national doctrine and it only remained to apply it in practice. This is to be the work of the Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges. In that instrument the clergy of France inserted the articles of Constance repeated at Basle, and upon that warrant assumed authority to regulate the collation of benefices and the temporal administration of the Churches on the sole basis of the common law, under the king&#x27;s patronage, and independently of the pope&#x27;s action. From Eugene IV to Leo X the popes did not cease to protest against the Pragmatic Sanction, until it was replaced by the Concordat of Bologna in 1516. But, if its provisions disappeared from the laws of France, the principles it embodied for a time nonetheless continued to inspire the schools of theology and parliamentary jurisprudence. Those principles even appeared at the Council of Trent, where the ambassadors, theologians, and bishops of France repeatedly championed them, notably when the council discussed whether episcopal jurisdiction comes immediately from God or through the pope, whether or not the council ought to ask confirmation of its decrees from the sovereign pontiff, etc. Then again, it was in the name of the Liberties of the Gallican Church that a part of the clergy and the &quot;Parlementaires&quot; opposed the publication of the Council of Trent; and the crown decided to detach from it and publish what seemed good, in the form of ordinances emanating from the royal authority.

=== After the Reformation ===
The assassination of Henry IV, which was exploited to move public opinion against Ultramontanism and the activity of Edmond Richer, syndic of the Sorbonne, brought about, at the beginning of the seventeenth century, a revival of Gallicanism. In 1663 the Sorbonne declared that it admitted no authority of the pope over the king&#x27;s temporal dominion, nor his superiority to a general council, nor infallibility apart from the Church&#x27;s consent.

In 1682, Louis XIV having decided to extend to all the Churches of his kingdom the &quot;droit de regale&quot;, or right of receiving the revenue of vacant sees, and of conferring the sees themselves at his pleasure, Pope Innocent XI opposed the king&#x27;s designs. The king assembled the clergy of France and, on 19 March 1682, the thirty-six prelates and thirty-four deputies of the second order who constituted that assembly adopted the four articles summarized above and transmitted them to all the other bishops and archbishops of France. Three days later the king commanded the registration of the articles in all the schools and faculties of theology; no one could be admitted to degrees in theology without having maintained this doctrine in one of his theses and it was forbidden to write anything against them. Pope Innocent XI issued the Rescript of 11 April 1682, in which he voided and annulled all that the assembly had done in regard to the &quot;regale&quot;; he also refused Bulls to all members of the assembly who were proposed for vacant bishoprics.

In the same way Alexander VIII, by a Constitution dated 4 August 1690, quashed as detrimental to the Holy See the proceedings both in the matter of the regale and in that of the declaration on the ecclesiastical power and jurisdiction, which had been prejudicial to the clerical estate and order. The bishops designate to whom Bulls had been refused received them at length, in 1693, only after addressing to Pope Innocent XII a letter in which they disavowed everything that had been decreed in that assembly in regard to the ecclesiastical power and the pontifical authority. The king himself wrote to the pope (14 September 1693) to announce that a royal order had been issued against the execution of the edict of 23 March 1682.

In spite of these disavowals, the Declaration of 1682 remained thenceforward the living symbol of Gallicanism, professed by the great majority of the French clergy, obligatorily defended in the faculties of theology, schools, and seminaries, guarded from the lukewarmness of French theologians and the attacks of foreigners by the inquisitorial vigilance of the French parliaments, which never failed to condemn to suppression every work that seemed hostile to the principles of the Declaration.

From France Gallicanism spread, about the middle of the eighteenth century, into the Low Countries, thanks to the works of the jurisconsult Zeger Bernhard van Espen. Under the pseudonym of Febronius, Hontheim introduced it into Germany where it took the forms of Febronianism and Josephism. The Synod of Pistoia (1786) even tried to acclimatize it in Italy. But its diffusion was sharply arrested by the French Revolution, which took away its chief support by overturning the thrones of kings. Against the Revolution that drove them out and wrecked their sees, nothing was left to the bishops of France but to link themselves closely with the Holy See. After the Concordat of 1801 French Governments made some pretence of reviving, in the Organic Articles, the &quot;Ancient Gallican Liberties&quot; and the obligation of teaching the articles of 1682, but ecclesiastical Gallicanism was never again resuscitated except in the form of a vague mistrust of Rome. On the fall of Napoleon and the Bourbons, the work of Lamennais, of &quot;L&#x27;Avenir&quot; and other publications devoted to Roman ideas, the influence of Prosper Guéranger, and the effects of religious teaching ever increasingly deprived it of its partisans.

When the First Vatican Council opened, in 1869, it had in France only timid defenders. When that council declared that the pope has in the Church the plenitude of jurisdiction in matters of faith, morals discipline, and in administration, that his decisions &quot;ex cathedra&quot; are of themselves, and without the assent of the Church, infallible and irreformable, it dealt Gallicanism a fatal blow. Three of the four articles were directly condemned. As to the remaining one, the first, the council made no specific declaration; but an important indication of the Catholic doctrine was given in the condemnation fulminated by Pope Pius IX against the 24th proposition of the &quot;Syllabus of Errors&quot;, in which it was asserted that the Church cannot have recourse to force and is without any temporal authority, direct or indirect. Pope Leo XIII shed more direct light upon the question in his Encyclical &quot;Immortale Dei&quot; (12 November 1885), where we read: &quot;God has apportioned the government of the human race between two powers, the ecclesiastical and the civil, the former set over things divine, the latter over things human. Each is restricted within limits which are perfectly determined and defined in conformity with its own nature and special aim. There is therefore, as it were a circumscribed sphere in which each exercises its functions &quot;jure proprio&quot;&quot;. And in the Encyclical &quot;Sapientiae Christianae&quot; (10 January 1890), the same pontiff adds: &quot;The Church and the State have each its own power, and neither of the two powers is subject to the other.&quot;

<text>The Brayton cycle, also known as the Joule cycle, is a thermodynamic cycle that describes the operation of certain heat engines that have air or some other gas as their working fluid.
It is characterized by isentropic compression and expansion, and isobaric heat addition and rejection, though practical engines have adiabatic rather than isentropic steps.

The most common current application is in airbreathing jet engines and gas turbine engines.

The engine cycle is named after George Brayton (1830–1892), the American engineer, who developed the Brayton Ready Motor in 1872, using a piston compressor and piston expander.
An engine using the cycle was originally proposed and patented by Englishman John Barber in 1791, using a reciprocating compressor and a turbine expander.

There are two main types of Brayton cycles: closed and open.
In a closed cycle, the working gas stays inside the engine. Heat is introduced with a heat exchanger or external combustion and expelled with a heat exchanger.
With the open cycle, air from the atmosphere is drawn in, goes through three steps of the cycle, and is expelled again to the atmosphere. Open cycles allow for internal combustion.
Although the cycle is open, it is conventionally assumed for the purposes of thermodynamic analysis that the exhaust gases are reused in the intake, enabling analysis as a closed cycle.

==History==

In 1872, George Brayton applied for a patent for his &quot;Ready Motor&quot;, a reciprocating heat engine operating on a gas power cycle. The engine was a two-stroke and produced power on every revolution. Brayton engines used a separate piston compressor and piston expander, with compressed air heated by internal fire as it entered the expander cylinder. The first versions of the Brayton engine were vapor engines which mixed fuel with air as it entered the compressor; town gas was used or a surface carburetor was also used for mobile operation . The fuel / air was contained in a reservoir / tank and then it was admitted to the expansion cylinder and burned. As the fuel/air mixture entered the expansion cylinder, it was ignited by a pilot flame. A screen was used to prevent the fire from entering or returning to the reservoir. In early versions of the engine, this screen sometimes failed and an explosion would occur. In 1874, Brayton solved the explosion problem by adding the fuel just prior to the expander cylinder. The engine now used heavier fuels such as kerosene and fuel oil. Ignition remained a pilot flame. Brayton produced and sold &quot;Ready Motors&quot; to perform a variety of tasks like water pumping, mill operation, running generators, and marine propulsion. The &quot;Ready Motors&quot; were produced from 1872 to sometime in the 1880s; several hundred such motors were likely produced during this time period. Brayton licensed the design to Simone in the UK. Many variations of the layout were used; some were single-acting and some were double-acting. Some had under walking beams; others had overhead walking beams. Both horizontal and vertical models were built. Sizes ranged from less than one to over 40 horsepower. Critics of the time claimed the engines ran smoothly and had a reasonable efficiency.

Brayton-cycle engines were some of the first internal combustion engines used for motive power. In 1875, John Holland used a Brayton engine to power the world&#x27;s first self-propelled submarine (Holland boat #1). In 1879, a Brayton engine was used to power a second submarine, the &quot;Fenian Ram&quot;. John Philip Holland&#x27;s submarines are preserved in the Paterson Museum in the Old Great Falls Historic District of Paterson, New Jersey.

In 1878, George B. Selden patented the first internal combustion automobile. Inspired by the internal combustion engine invented by Brayton displayed at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876, Selden patented a four-wheel car working on a smaller, lighter, multicylinder version. He then filed a series of amendments to his application which stretched out the legal process, resulting in a delay of 16 years before the patent was granted on November 5, 1895. In 1903, Selden sued Ford for patent infringement and Henry Ford fought the Selden patent until 1911. Selden had never actually produced a working car, so during the trial, two machines were constructed according to the patent drawings. Ford argued his cars used the four-stroke Alphonse Beau de Rochas cycle or Otto cycle and not the Brayton-cycle engine used in the Selden auto. Ford won the appeal of the original case.

In 1887, Brayton developed and patented a four-stroke direct-injection oil engine. The fuel system used a variable-quantity pump and liquid-fuel, high-pressure, spray-type injection. The liquid was forced through a spring-loaded, relief-type valve (injector) which caused the fuel to become divided into small droplets. Injection was timed to occur at or near the peak of the compression stroke. A platinum igniter provided the source of ignition. Brayton describes the invention as: “I have discovered that heavy oils can be mechanically converted into a finely divided condition within a firing portion of the cylinder, or in a communicating firing chamber.” Another part reads, “I have for the first time, so far as my knowledge extends, regulated speed by variably controlling the direct discharge of liquid fuel into the combustion chamber or cylinder into a finely divided condition highly favorable to immediate combustion.” This was likely the first engine to use a lean-burn system to regulate engine speed and output. In this manner, the engine fired on every power stroke and speed and output were controlled solely by the quantity of fuel injected.

In 1890, Brayton developed and patented a four-stroke, air-blast oil engine. The fuel system delivered a variable quantity of vaporized fuel to the center of the cylinder under pressure at or near the peak of the compression stroke. The ignition source was an igniter made from platinum wire. A variable-quantity injection pump provided the fuel to an injector where it was mixed with air as it entered the cylinder. A small crank-driven compressor provided the source for air. This engine also used the lean-burn system.

Rudolf Diesel originally proposed a very high compression, constant-temperature cycle where the heat of compression would exceed the heat of combustion, but after several years of experiments, he realized that the constant-temperature cycle would not work in a piston engine. Early Diesel engines use an air blast system which was pioneered by Brayton in 1890. Consequently, these early engines use the constant-pressure cycle.

==Models==
A Brayton-type engine consists of three components: a compressor, a mixing chamber, and an expander.

Modern Brayton engines are almost always a turbine type, although Brayton only made piston engines. 
In the original 19th-century Brayton engine, ambient air is drawn into a piston compressor, where it is compressed; ideally an isentropic process. The compressed air then passes through a mixing chamber where fuel is added, an isobaric process. The pressurized air and fuel mixture is then ignited in an expansion cylinder and energy is released, causing the heated air and combustion products to expand through a piston/cylinder, another ideally isentropic process. Some of the work extracted by the piston/cylinder is used to drive the compressor through a crankshaft arrangement.

Gas turbine engines are also Brayton engines, with three components: an air compressor, a combustion chamber, and a gas turbine.

Ideal Brayton cycle:
# isentropic process – ambient air is drawn into the compressor, where it is pressurized.
# isobaric process – the compressed air then passes through a combustion chamber, where fuel is burned, heating that air—a constant-pressure process, since the chamber is open to flow in and out.
# isentropic process – the heated, pressurized air then gives up its energy, expanding through a turbine (or series of turbines). Some of the work extracted by the turbine is used to drive the compressor.
# isobaric process – heat rejection (in the atmosphere).

Actual Brayton cycle:

# adiabatic process – compression
# isobaric process – heat addition
# adiabatic process – expansion
# isobaric process – heat rejection
Since neither the compression nor the expansion can be truly isentropic, losses through the compressor and the expander represent sources of inescapable working inefficiencies. In general, increasing the compression ratio is the most direct way to increase the overall power output of a Brayton system.

The efficiency of the ideal Brayton cycle is formula_1, where formula_2 is the heat capacity ratio. Figure 1 indicates how the cycle efficiency changes with an increase in pressure ratio. Figure 2 indicates how the specific power output changes with an increase in the gas turbine inlet temperature for two different pressure ratio values.

The highest gas temperature in the cycle occurs where work transfer to the high pressure turbine (rotor inlet) takes place. This is lower than the highest gas temperature in the engine (combustion zone). The maximum cycle temperature is limited by the turbine materials and required turbine life. This also limits the pressure ratios that can be used in the cycle. For a fixed-turbine inlet temperature, the net work output per cycle increases with the pressure ratio (thus the thermal efficiency) and the net work output. With less work output per cycle, a larger mass flow rate (thus a larger system) is needed to maintain the same power output, which may not be economical. In most common designs, the pressure ratio of a gas turbine ranges from about 11 to 16.

==Methods to increase power==
The power output of a Brayton engine can be improved by:

* Reheat, wherein the working fluid—in most cases air—expands through a series of turbines, then is passed through a second combustion chamber before expanding to ambient pressure through a final set of turbines, has the advantage of increasing the power output possible for a given compression ratio without exceeding any metallurgical constraints (typically about 1000 °C). The use of an afterburner for jet aircraft engines can also be referred to as &quot;reheat&quot;; it is a different process in that the reheated air is expanded through a thrust nozzle rather than a turbine. The metallurgical constraints are somewhat alleviated, enabling much higher reheat temperatures (about 2000 °C). Reheat is most often used to improve the specific power, and is usually associated with a drop in efficiency; this effect is especially pronounced in afterburners due to the extreme amounts of extra fuel used.
* In overspray, after the first compressor stage, water is injected into the compressor, thus increasing the mass-flow inside the compressor, increasing the turbine output power significantly and reducing compressor outlet temperatures. In the second compressor stage, the water is completely converted to a gas form, offering some intercooling via its latent heat of vaporization.

==Methods to improve efficiency==
The efficiency of a Brayton engine can be improved by:

* Increasing pressure ratio, as Figure 1 above shows, increasing the pressure ratio increases the efficiency of the Brayton cycle. This is analogous to the increase of efficiency seen in the Otto cycle when the compression ratio is increased. However, practical limits occur when it comes to increasing the pressure ratio. First of all, increasing the pressure ratio increases the compressor discharge temperature. Since the turbine temperature has a limit determined by metallurgical and life constraints the allowable rise in temperature (fuel added) in the combustor becomes smaller. Also, because the length of the compressor blades becomes progressively smaller in the higher pressure stages a constant running gap, through the compressor, between the blade tips and the engine casing becomes a bigger percentage of the compressor blade height increasing air leakage past the tips. This causes a drop in compressor efficiency, and is most likely to occur in smaller gas turbines (since blades are inherently smaller to begin with). Finally, as can be seen in Figure 1, the efficiency levels off as pressure ratio increases. Hence, little gain is expected by increasing the pressure ratio further if it is already at a high level.
* Recuperator – If the Brayton cycle is run at a low pressure ratio and a high temperature increase in the combustion chamber, the exhaust gas (after the last turbine stage) might still be hotter than the compressed inlet gas (after the last compression stage but before the combustor). In that case, a heat exchanger can be used to transfer thermal energy from the exhaust to the already compressed gas, before it enters the combustion chamber. The thermal energy transferred is effectively reused, thus increasing efficiency. However, this form of heat recycling is only possible if the engine is run in a low-efficiency mode with low pressure ratio in the first place. Transferring heat from the outlet (after the last turbine) to the inlet (before the first compressor stage) would reduce efficiency, as hotter inlet air means more volume, thus more work for the compressor. For engines with liquid cryogenic fuels, namely hydrogen, it might be feasible, though, to use the fuel to cool the inlet air before compression to increase efficiency. This concept is extensively studied for the SABRE engine.
* A Brayton engine also forms half of the combined cycle system, which combines with a Rankine engine to further increase overall efficiency. However, although this increases overall efficiency, it does not actually increase the efficiency of the Brayton cycle itself.
* Cogeneration systems make use of the waste heat from Brayton engines, typically for hot water production or space heating.

==Variants==

===Closed Brayton cycle===
A closed Brayton cycle recirculates the working fluid; the air expelled from the turbine is reintroduced into the compressor, this cycle uses a heat exchanger to heat the working fluid instead of an internal combustion chamber. The closed Brayton cycle is used, for example, in closed-cycle gas turbine and 

===Solar Brayton cycle===
In 2002, a hybrid open solar Brayton cycle was operated for the first time consistently and effectively with relevant papers published, in the frame of the EU SOLGATE program.
The air was heated from 570 to over 1000K into the combustor chamber. Further hybridization was achieved during the EU Solhyco project running a hybridized Brayton cycle with solar energy and biodiesel only.
This technology was scaled up to 4.6 MW within the project Solugas located near Seville, where it is currently demonstrated at precommercial scale.

===Reverse Brayton cycle===
A Brayton cycle that is driven in reverse uses work to move heat.
This makes it a form of gas refrigeration cycle.
When air is the working fluid, it is known as the Bell Coleman cycle.

It is also used in the LNG industry for subcooling LNG using power from a gas turbine to drive the compressor.

===Inverted Brayton cycle===

This is an open Brayton cycle which also generates work from heat, but with a different order of the stages.
Incoming air is first heated at atmospheric pressure, and then passes through the turbine, generating work. The gas, now at a pressure lower than atmospheric, is cooled in a heat exchanger. The compressor raises the pressure again so the gas can be expelled to the atmosphere.

<text>USS &quot;George Washington Carver&quot; (SSBN-656), a fleet ballistic missile submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for George Washington Carver (1865–1943), an American researcher and inventor.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract for &quot;George Washington Carver&quot;″s construction was awarded on 29 July 1963, and her keel was laid down on 24 August 1964 by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company at Newport News, Virginia. She was launched on 14 August 1965, sponsored by African-American contralto Marian Anderson (1897–1993), and commissioned on 15 June 1966 with Captain R. D. Donavan in command of the Blue Crew and Lieutenant Commander Carl J. Lidel in command of the Gold Crew.

==Service history==

Following shakedown, &quot;George Washington Carver&quot;&#x27;s began her first strategic deterrent patrol on 12 December 1966. She operated out of Holy Loch, Scotland until September, 1971, when she transferred to Groton, Conn. for two months of special operations before entering the shipyard at Electric Boat Div., Groton, Conn. in November, 1971, for reactor refueling and overhaul. &quot;George Washington Carver&quot; was in dry dock at Naval Station Rota, Spain for overhaul beginning February 1977. A team from Electric Boat Div. Groton, CT was deployed to complete the overhaul/refit.

:&quot;History needed for 1966-1991.&quot;

===Conversion of missile tubes===

In 1991, &quot;George Washington Carver&quot;&#x27;s ballistic missile had missiles removed and tubes were filled with ballast at Naval Weapons Station, Charleston, SC. The submarine and crew then received a change of homeport to Naval Submarine Base, Bangor, WA and assisted on the west coast in various assignments before finally entering the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard at Bremerton, Washington.

:&quot;History needed for 1991-1993.&quot;
==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;George Washington Carver&quot; was both decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 18 March 1993 at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington, where her scrapping via the U.S. Navy″s Ship and Submarine Recycling Program was completed on 12 March 1994.

<text>Republican Party of Afghanistan (, &quot;Hezb-e Jomhorikhahan-e Afghanistan&quot;) is a political party in Afghanistan. When the party was founded in 1999, it declared the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as the programme of the party. Sebghatullah Sanjar was elected as the chairman of the party.

The party established liaisons with the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan office in Kabul, and was invited to the 2001 Bonn conference; Zai Waziri, the founder and its first leader participated the Bonn Conference. However, a shift in the UNSMA office resulted in the group being degraded to observers at the conference. Along with other democratic sections that had been invited to the Bonn conference, the party took part in founding the Council of Defenders of Peace and Democracy in the spring of 2002, just weeks before the opening of the Emergency Loya Jirga. In late 2002, the leadership of the party was passed over to Sibghatullah Sanjar, after an election within the party ranks.

During the constitutional Loya jirga of 2003, the Party announced its support for a presidential system in the future constitution of Afghanistan. The Party also expressed its support for free education and health care. As of 2003, the party claimed to have 35 000 members across the country.

On 6 March 2004, it became the first political party to register at the Ministry of Justice under the new system.

On October 1, 2005 it took part in founding the Advisory Commission of National and Democratic Parties (AC-NDP), a broad coalition of factions opposed to &#x27;warlordism&#x27;. However it soon withdrew from the new structure.

The party headquarters is located in Qae Fathollah, a district of Kabul.

Adla Bahram is the director of women&#x27;s affairs of the party and now the elected party president.

The party leader, Sebghatullah Sanjar, was assassinated in Kabul on 5 May 2012.

<doc id="411454" wikidata="Q526649" url="?curid=411454" title="IBM RPG II">
<text>RPG II is a very early and popular version of the IBM RPG programming language.

It was developed in the late 1960s and designed to work on the smallest IBM systems of the time such as the IBM 1130, IBM System/3, System/32, System/34, System/36. It was also available for the System/370, The Singer System 10, Sperry Univac 90/25, 90/30, 90/40, System 80, 1100 mainframe series and the Wang VS Series. ICL produced versions for its ICL 2903 system and for VME/K; and Burroughs Corporation produced an RPG II compiler with database extensions for its B1700 series of computers. Digital Equipment Corporation had their own implementation named VAX RPG II for VAX/VMS systems.

An enhanced version RPG III appeared in 1978.

It has a number of unusual features, including: an implied processing loop; and that it is a fixed-format programming language, so that programs are difficult to read without a special debugging template.

==Features==
RPG II is a fixed-format programming language, which means that code must be placed in exact column locations in order to generate correct results. There are eight different specification types, and separate coding forms are used to write each, and a special debugging template used as an aid to read program printouts.

Every RPG II program executes within an implied loop, the program cycle, which applies the program successively to every record of a file - this is documented via a &quot;Logic Flow&quot; diagram on the debugging template. Each record (individual punched card) would be compared to each line in the program, which would act upon the record, or not, based upon whether that line had an &quot;indicator&quot; turned &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot; — from a set of logical variables numbered 01–99 for user-defined purposes, or other smaller sets based upon record, field, or report processing functions. Special variables such as UDATE, UYEAR, PAGE, and so forth, are filled when the program begins or when page overflow occurs, even though there is no explicit instruction for these activities. Total calculations and output are done at &quot;total time,&quot; after the detail cycle when L1/LR has been set on by fixed logic.

The concept of RPG&#x27;s program cycle fitted neatly with a cyclical machine that read cards, summarised their contents and prints a result, rather like a tabulating machine. The language was extended to handle other input and output devices and provides a fast and efficient method of programming.

Devices such as the workstation (WORKSTN), the keyboard (KEYBORD), or the console (CONSOLE) do not have a fixed number of records at the beginning of the job and therefore, in order to incorporate the fixed-logic RPG &quot;Last Record&quot; cycle, the LR indicator can be set on with a SETON instruction. LR cannot be set off.

RPG II did not evolve much from the 1977 implementation on the System/34 to 2000 when the Advanced/36 was discontinued from marketing. Changes that were made from the 1970s version included the IFEQ/IFNE/IFGT/IFGE/IFLT/IFLE and END grouping. Also, the call/parm to be able to call external subroutines. Another change was that for internal subroutines, you no longer had to put SR in columns 7 and 8 of the C (calculation) specs.

Third-party providers sold more than 200 different assembler subroutines that could be used by System/36 and Advanced/36 programmers to exceed RPG II limitations. Some of the limitations of RPG II on the System/3, 32, 34 and 36 including the Advanced/36 was the 64K limit and the number of files you could have in a program. So if you had a lot of programming lines or had large arrays, it was easy to exceed the 64,000 bytes of object code. However, RPG II running on the AS/400 and its follow on iseries and IBM i (those running OS/400 or i5/OS in what is called S/36E (execution environment)) those limits (the 64K bytes and the number of files) were either greatly expanded or removed.

== RPGII specifications ==

In the System/36 implementation of RPG II, there are eight different specification (spec) types, that is a fixed-format line of text, 80 characters (bytes) in length, derived from the original use of punched card input for earlier IBM systems, like the System/3. Like specifications were grouped together, and each type was required to be in a specific order: &quot;U&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;C&quot; AND &quot;O&quot;.

&quot;Specification&quot; codes appear in column 6 of an RPG-II specification:


&quot;Operation codes&quot; appear in columns 28–32 of an RPG-II calculation specification.

# CALL/PARM was added to RPG II with Release 6.0 (also known as the VASP).

CHAIN retrieves the record in the indexed file named in Factor 2 that matches the exact key specified by the value in Factor 1.

SETLL causes the index pointer for the file named in Factor 2 to be positioned at the location specified by the value in Factor 1.

SORTA causes the named array to be sorted in place; that is, the elements appear in order.

Z-SUB calculates Factor 2 with opposite sign and moved to result field.

XFOOT causes an array to be summed and the result moved to result field.

MVR must follow a DIV operation. The integer remainder of the DIV operation is placed in the result field. MVR following the DIV operation for &quot;56 divided by 3&quot; would place the value 2 in the result field.

== Indicators ==
Indicators are either &#x27;set&#x27; or not, they are &quot;flags&quot; or boolean data types.
* Generic, usually manually set, for custom usage within &quot;I&quot;, &quot;C&quot; and &quot;O&quot; specs of a program:
::      01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19
:: 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39
:: 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59
:: 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79
:: 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99
* Halt Indicators, manually set within the calculation &quot;C&quot;-specs, to terminate a program with a return code:
:: H1 H2 H3 H4 H5 H6 H7 H8 H9
* Matching Indicators, assigned to input &quot;I&quot;-spec fields, automatically set when reading records from a file, to coordinate the hierarchy of and signal which fields (variables) within records from two or more files are synchronized, assuming a sorted order of the records within each file, the records being processed sequentially:
:: M1 M2 M3 M4 M5 M6 M7 M8 M9, and which reflects that matching has occurred
* Control-Level Indicators, assigned to input &quot;I&quot;-spec fields, to coordinate the hierarchy of and signal which fields within a record from a file are grouped, assuming a sorted order of the records within a file, the records being processed sequentially:
:: L0 L1 L2 L3 L4 L5 L6 L7 L8 L9
* Command Key Indicators, to signal to the program processing input from a workstation keyboard, equivalent to the function keys (, and ) on a PC keyboard, used instead of the key:
:: KA KB KC KD KE KF KG KH KI KJ KK KL KM KN KP KQ KR KS KT KU KV KW KX KY
:: These indicators refer to command keys 1 to 24, in that order. Note that there is no indicator.
* First Cycle Indicator, set automatically upon output of the first page, mainly used for printer files, used similarly to an overflow indicator for controlling output like page breaks and headings:
:: 1P
* Overflow Indicators, tripped automatically processing the pagination limits of a printer output file, per each file&#x27;s &quot;L&quot;-spec line counter, and may be set manually, too. Usually establishing page breaks and printing of headings. One indicator each, for up to 8 output files:
:: OA OB OC OD OE OF OG OV
* Last Record Indicator, not to be confused with Control-Level indicators, terminates a program, to return control to the batch processing jobstream (script), set automatically when end-of-file is reached on a sequentially processed file, manually set to terminate a program that has no sequential process source (file):
:: LR
* External Indicators, generic for custom usage, passed to the program from the jobstream control (script) batch file:
:: U1 U2 U3 U4 U5 U6 U7 U8

Foldable sheets, templates, plastic coated against wear and staining, were available, summarizing the different specifications. Used for the visual inspection and verification of the fixed-format source code text when held against its printed output. They matched and aligned with the then standard spacing of the text, as drawn from the original usage of punched cards:
