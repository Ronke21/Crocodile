<text>[[Capital punishment]] is a legal penalty in the U.S. state of [[Nevada]].

The last person executed in the state was convicted murderer Daryl Mack in 2006. There have been no executions in Nevada since then, in part because of a shortage of drugs used in executions by lethal injection.

== History ==

The first recorded execution in the area that is now Nevada was the hanging of John Carr for murdering Bernhard Cherry of Carson City on November 30, 1860, and the first recorded legal execution in the Nevada Territory was the hanging of Allen Milstead outside Dayton for killing Lyon County Commissioner T. Varney at Ragtown. Since the reinstatement of capital punishment in 1976, 12 people have been executed by the state. The most recent execution was in 2006, when Daryl Mack was executed for murder. As of June 2024, There are 51 people on death row in Nevada prisons.

Elizabeth Potts, who was hanged in 1890, was the only woman legally executed in the state, alongside her husband Josiah Potts, for the murder and partial dismemberment of Miles Faucett.

Hanging was the method prescribed by law from 1860 to 1921. The venue of executions moved from the counties to Nevada State Prison in 1903. In response to Mormon preferences, the Nevada State Legislature passed a statute in 1910 that became effective in January 1911, allowing condemned prisoners to choose between execution by shooting or hanging. On May 14, 1913, Andriza Mircovich became the only inmate in Nevada to be executed by shooting. After the warden of Nevada State Prison was unable to find five men to form a firing squad, a shooting machine was built to carry out Mircovich&#x27;s execution. A law in 1921 made the gas chamber the sole means of execution. It was used from the 1924 execution of Gee Jon to the 1979 execution of Jesse Bishop, both at Nevada State Prison. A total of 32 men were executed by gas chamber in Nevada between this time. Lethal injection became the sole method of execution in Nevada by 1985, starting with the execution of 47 year old Carroll Edward Cole. 

The use of cyanide gas in Nevada was used as a plot device in the short story &quot;Nevada Gas&quot; by Raymond Chandler.

In April 2021, the Nevada Assembly passed a bill that would have repealed the capital punishment statute. However, the state senate did not act on the matter after Governor Steve Sisolak said that he believes some crimes deserve the death penalty, suggesting that he would veto the bill. 

==Legal process==
When the prosecution seeks the death penalty, the sentence is decided by the jury and must be unanimous.

In case of a hung jury during the penalty phase of the trial, the judge has discretion to order a retrial or impose a life sentence.

Under the Nevada Constitution, clemency can be granted by the governor of Nevada with advice and consent of a board on which he sits, and also includes justices of the state supreme court and the state attorney general.

Lethal injection is the only method of execution in Nevada.

==Capital crimes==
First degree murder can be punished by death if it involves one of the following aggravating factors:
#The murder was committed by a person under sentence of imprisonment.
#The murder was committed by a person who, at any time before a penalty hearing is conducted for the murder, is or has been convicted of:
#*Another murder and the provisions of subsection 12 do not otherwise apply to that other murder; or
#*A felony involving the use or threat of violence to the person of another and the provisions of subsection 4 do not otherwise apply to that felony.
#The murder was committed by a person who knowingly created a great risk of death to more than one person by means of a weapon, device or course of action which would normally be hazardous to the lives of more than one person.
#The murder was committed while the person was engaged, alone or with others, in the commission of, or an attempt to commit or flight after committing or attempting to commit, any robbery, arson in the first degree, burglary, invasion of the home or kidnapping in the first degree, and the person charged:

#The murder was committed with the intent to commit, cause, aid, further or conceal an act of terrorism.

==Death row==

The men&#x27;s death row in Nevada is located at High Desert State Prison. The death row for women is in the Florence McClure Women&#x27;s Correctional Center (previously Southern Nevada Women&#x27;s Correctional Center).

The execution chamber, which opened in 2016, is located at Ely State Prison. Prior to 2016, executions by the state of Nevada were still designated to be carried out in the former gas chamber at the otherwise closed Nevada State Prison. Due to a lack of elevator access, this former gas chamber was not compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). Greg Cox, the director of the Nevada Department of Corrections, stated that he anticipated a legal challenge to carrying out the execution there if an execution date is set. That, and the inconvenience of re-opening the prison to conduct an execution at the only place the law allowed, led to the construction of the new execution chamber at Ely and the amendment of the law, making it the new sole place for executions. There was some local humor about the old place of execution being closed because it was unsafe.

<text>Capital punishment is a legal penalty in the U.S. state of Ohio, although all executions have been suspended indefinitely by Governor Mike DeWine until a replacement for lethal injection is chosen by the Ohio General Assembly. The last execution in the state was in July 2018, when Robert J. Van Hook was executed via lethal injection for murder.

==History==
, there have been 393 executions in Ohio&#x27;s history.

Before 1885, executions were carried out by hanging in the county where the crime was committed. The Northwest Territory&#x27;s first criminal statutes, also known as &quot;Marietta Code&quot;, date from 1788, 15 years before Ohio&#x27;s statehood in 1803. These statutes did not ensure yet any uniform means of execution, nor did they designate where the executions were to take place. The statutory change from 1815 had executions to be carried out locally and required the local sheriff to be the local executioner, and in his absence or in any case of him being impeded, the local coroner would have to substitute him. That ordeal appears to be the first statewide attempt to ensure uniform means of execution and to designate where such executions were to take place, however, it also appears to confirm legally a practice which had become institutionalized even before Ohio&#x27;s statehood in 1803.

In 1885, the legislature enacted a law that required executions to be carried out at the Ohio Penitentiary in Columbus by hanging, and law handed the executioner&#x27;s job to the penitentiary&#x27;s warden. This practice of naming the State Prison&#x27;s warden executioner seems to have continued well into the 20th Century, as can be learned from the 1938 death sentence against Anna Marie Hahn.

In 1897 the gallows were replaced by electrocution, which was considered to be a more technologically advanced and humane method of execution. Ohio also became the second state to use the electric chair. 28 hangings and 315 electrocutions were carried out at the now-defunct Ohio Penitentiary in Columbus from 1885 to 1963. On October 27, 1911, 43 years old Charles Justice was electrocuted for the murder of John Shoup, a farmer from Xenia who, on September 26, 1910, had caught Justice while he tried to steal from the Shoups&#x27; chicken house and was subsequently shot three times. Ironically, Justice had previously been an inmate of the Ohio Penitentiary and he had worked in the prison tin shop, where he built iron clamps to replace the leather straps that Ohio&#x27;s electric chair was originally fitted with. He was therefore executed in the very same chair he had helped improve.

The 31st inmate executed in Ohio since 1999, Marvallous Keene, was the 1000th person to be executed by lethal injection since its first use for executions by the U.S. in 1982. 

On July 1, 2011, Lundbeck, the Danish pharmaceutical company that holds the sole licence to manufacture pentobarbital in the United States, announced that its distributors would deny distribution of pentobarbital to U.S. prisons that carry out the death penalty by lethal injection. Ohio used up its supply of pentobarbital on September 25, 2013, with the execution of Harry Mitts Jr. On January 16, 2014, Ohio executed Dennis McGuire who was convicted of raping and then murdering 22-year-old Joy Stewart who was 30 weeks pregnant, becoming the first U.S. inmate to be executed with a combination of the drugs midazolam and hydromorphone. The effects of this combination of drugs on the body are controversial and not well understood. McGuire took 25 minutes to die, an unusually long time for an execution, being among the longest since Ohio resumed capital punishment in 1999.

In January 2015, the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction announced that all executions scheduled for the remainder of that year would be postponed due to the lack of availability of required drugs. In October 2015, the department further announced that Governor John Kasich had granted additional reprieves to all inmates due to be executed in 2016 for the same reason. Executions resumed in Ohio on July 26, 2017, when the state executed murderer Ronald Phillips.

The most recent execution in Ohio was in July 2018, when Robert J. Van Hook was executed via lethal injection for murder. The execution was carried out at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in unincorporated Scioto County, just outside the community of Lucasville. Since January 2012, death row for the majority of male inmates is located at the Chillicothe Correctional Institution (CCI) in unincorporated Ross County, just outside of Chillicothe. A few high-security male death row inmates are held at the Ohio State Penitentiary (OSP) in Youngstown. Condemned female inmates are housed at the Ohio Reformatory for Women in Marysville and death row inmates with serious medical conditions are held at the Franklin Medical Center in Columbus. Before this, most male death row inmates were held at OSP with a few being held at the Mansfield Correctional Institution in Mansfield. The move to CCI allows the units at OSP and Mansfield to be used to separate violent inmates from the general population and will provide increased security and reduce transportation costs to both the execution chamber at SOCF and the Franklin Medical Center for inmates medical treatment.

On December 8, 2020, Governor Mike DeWine placed what he called an “unofficial moratorium” on capital punishment in the state, as a result of the impossibility to acquire drugs needed to carry out a lethal injection. DeWine indicated no executions would be carried out until the Ohio General Assembly approves another method, as lethal injection is the only currently approved method. 

In January 2024, after Alabama authorized the execution of Kenneth Eugene Smith with nitrogen hypoxia, Ohio lawmakers were considering to legalize nitrogen gas as a new method of execution aside from lethal injection, and the new method was supported by the attorney general of Ohio.

, Ohio has 114 inmates on death row. Notable inmates on Ohio&#x27;s death row include serial killers Shawn Grate, Anthony Kirkland, and Michael Madison. The only woman on Ohio&#x27;s death row is Donna Roberts, who murdered her ex-husband in order to collect his life insurance.

==Methods==
===Hanging===
Only 28 people were ever executed by the state of Ohio via hanging before the state switched to the electric chair in 1897.

&quot;That the mode of inflicting the punishment of death in all cases under this act, shall be by hanging by the neck, until the person so to be punished shall be dead; &amp; the sheriff, or the coroner in the case of the death, inability or absence of the sheriff of the proper county, in which the sentence of death shall be pronounced by force of this act, shall be the executioner&quot;.

===Electric chair===
Ohio switched its method of execution from hanging to electrocution in 1897.

Thomas Edison, a resident of Akron, Ohio, as well as New York, New Jersey, and Michigan, directed his employees to develop the electric chair. Edison felt that the electric chair would be less cruel than hanging. However, a prisoner&#x27;s bones were set on fire during Edison&#x27;s prison demonstration.

&quot;[O]n the 10th day of March 1938, the said Warden shall cause a current of electricity of sufficient intensity to cause death to pass through the body of the said defendant, the application of such current to be continued until the said defendant is dead, and may God have mercy on your soul&quot;.

Ohio executed 315 people via electrocution until 1963 before it switched over to lethal injection in the 1990s.

===Lethal injection===
Lethal injection is the current method of execution.

Over the years, the state of Ohio has used several methods of lethal injection, culminating in the two-drug combination of midazolam and hydromorphone.

The dose of midazolam starts at triple the dose used for sedation for office procedures, and the hydromorphone dose is a 150-to-500-fold overdose for parenteral analgesia in opioid-naïve patients.

==Legal process==
When the prosecution seeks the death penalty, the sentence is decided by the jury and must be unanimous.

In the case of a hung jury during the penalty phase of the trial, a life sentence is issued, even if only a single juror opposed death (there is no retrial).

The power of executive clemency belongs to the governor of Ohio, after receiving a non-binding recommendation from the Ohio Parole Board. Despite opposing the death penalty, Michael DiSalle allowed six of the 12 cases he reviewed as governor to proceed, stating that he would have otherwise violated his oath of office.

===Capital crimes===
A charge of aggravated murder with death penalty specifications may occur with at least one of the following special circumstances:
#The murder was the assassination of the president of the United States or person in the line of succession to the presidency, or of the governor or lieutenant governor of Ohio, or of the president-elect or vice president-elect of the United States, or of the governor-elect or lieutenant governor-elect of Ohio, or of a candidate for any of the foregoing offices.
#The murder was committed for hire. 
#The murder was committed for the purpose of escaping detection, apprehension, trial, or punishment for another offense committed by the offender.
#The murder was committed while the offender was under detention or while the offender was at large after having broken detention. 
#Prior to the murder, the offender was convicted of a previous offense having as an essential element the purposeful killing of or attempt to kill another, or the current offense was part of a course of conduct involving the offender&#x27;s purposeful killing of or attempt to kill two or more persons.
#The victim was a law enforcement officer, and the offender knew or reasonably should have known that fact, and the officer was either performing duties or the offender acted with the specific purpose of killing such officer. 
#The murder was committed while the offender was committing, attempting to commit, or fleeing immediately after committing or attempting to commit kidnapping, rape, aggravated arson, aggravated robbery, or aggravated burglary, and either the offender was the principal offender in the commission of the aggravated murder or, if not the principal offender, committed the aggravated murder with prior planning.
#The victim was a witness who was purposely killed by the offender either to prevent the victim from testifying, or in retaliation for prior testimony. 
#The offender, in the commission of the murder, purposefully caused the death of another who was under 13 years of age at the time of the commission of the offense, and either the offender was the principal offender in the commission of the offense or, if not the principal offender, committed the offense with prior planning.
#The offense was committed while the offender was committing, attempting to commit, or fleeing immediately after committing or attempting to commit terrorism.

==Opposition and controversy==
There is a movement in the state to end the death penalty. According to the Associated Press, Republicans such as former Ohio Governor Bob Taft, great-grandson of President William Howard Taft, and former Ohio Attorney General Jim Petro have publicly opposed the death penalty. Taft questioned the effectiveness of the death penalty as well as geographic and racial disparities. The former Speaker of the House in Ohio, also Republican, Larry Householder, wants the legislature to reconsider the law because of the cost of executions and the failure of the state to obtain drugs.

The BBC reported that The European Commission - the executive arm of the European Union - wished to ensure that no drugs were being exported from the Union for use in &quot;capital punishment, torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment&quot;. The EU is part of a worldwide movement against the death penalty. Amnesty International&#x27;s annual report found that in 2019, prisoners were executed in only 20 of the 195 countries of the world.

Members of many religious faiths in Ohio have also officially opposed the death penalty.

===Botched executions===
The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; noted in October 2009 that Ohio had three botched executions by lethal injection since 2006: Joseph Lewis Clark, Christopher Newton and Romell Broom. In November 2009, Ohio announced that it would only use a single drug for lethal injections, consisting of a single dose of sodium thiopental, the first state to do so. The first single drug execution was that of Kenneth Biros, 51, on Tuesday, December 8, 2009. Biros was convicted of murdering 22-year-old Tami Engstrom near Masury, Ohio in 1991. Biros&#x27; counsel indicated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit that Biros&#x27; execution, given that it is the first of its kind, may amount to &quot;human experimentation.&quot; Various appeals for clemency were ultimately denied. Ohio announced in January 2011 that it will change the drug used from sodium thiopental to pentobarbital, as the availability of sodium thiopental had become quite scarce. The first execution using pentobarbital, was that of Johnnie Baston, on March 10, 2011.

&quot;The Atlantic&quot; magazine wrote that on January 14, 2014, Dennis McGuire took over 11 minutes to die and was unable to breathe, during a lethal injection in Ohio&#x27;s death chamber. &quot;Over those 11 minutes or more he was fighting for breath, and I could see both of his fists were clenched the entire time,&quot; recounted Father Lawrence Hummer, an execution witness. &quot;There is no question in my mind that Dennis McGuire suffered greatly over many minutes.&quot;

===Failed executions===
Ohio has failed twice in its efforts to execute an inmate by lethal injection. Romell Broom and Alva Campbell had their executions aborted due to the execution teams not being able to find a usable vein. Both later died on death row while awaiting new execution dates.

<text>[[Capital punishment]] is a legal penalty in the U.S. state of [[Utah]].

Utah was the first state to resume executions after the 1972–1976 national moratorium on capital punishment ended with &quot;Gregg v. Georgia&quot;, when Gary Gilmore was executed by firing squad in 1977. Utah is one of only two states to have ever carried out executions by firing squad, and the only one to do so after the moratorium ended.

==History==

The spring 1850 garroting of Patsowits, a Ute, was the first recorded execution in the provisional State of Deseret. Utah Territory was established in September 1850, and it permitted condemned prisoners to choose between hanging and firing squad. In 1851, beheading was introduced as a third execution option. No prisoner chose this method and the option was eliminated in 1888. In 1955, Utah state lawmakers voted to introduce the electric chair; however, the state never used electrocution due to failure to provide appropriation. Forty-four executions occurred in the State of Utah and Utah Territory before the national moratorium in 1972; six were by hanging and 38 were by firing squad. In 1958, twenty-one-year-old Barton Kay Kirkham became the last prisoner to be hanged by the state of Utah. The last pre-moratorium execution in Utah took place on March 30, 1960.In 1967, when the last pre-moratorium execution took place, Utah was the only remaining state to allow death row inmates to choose between firing squad and hanging. Utah attempted to reintroduce death penalty statutes during the moratorium but they were struck down by the 1972 United States Supreme Court decision in the case &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot;. The state formally reinstated capital punishment on January 7, 1973, and the new death penalty statutes were approved by the United States Supreme Court with the reinstatement of capital punishment in 1976. The reinstatement allowed Utah to move forward with the death sentences of Dale Selby Pierre and William Andrews for crimes committed in 1974 prior to the reinstatement of capital punishment. They were later executed in 1987 and 1992, respectively. On January 17, 1977, Utah became the first state to execute a prisoner after the moratorium ended: Gary Gilmore was executed by a firing squad, having selected that method over hanging. Lethal injection was introduced in 1980 and in February of that year, the Utah State Legislature replaced the option of hanging with the option of lethal injection.

The first bill proposing to eliminate the firing squad option was introduced in the Utah House of Representatives in January 1996. In 2004, the legislature passed HB180, which removed the right of the condemned to choose the method of execution and left lethal injection as the only remaining option in the state. The abolition of the firing squad was not retroactive; three inmates on death row at Utah State Prison who chose this method of execution before the end of February 2004 were to be executed by firing squad under a grandfather clause. The execution of 49-year-old Ronnie Lee Gardner on June 18, 2010, was the state&#x27;s third execution by firing squad since the capital punishment moratorium was lifted, and the country&#x27;s first sanctioned shooting in 14 years.

Legislation signed by Utah Governor Gary Herbert in March 2015 restores the firing squad as a legal method of execution, requiring its use if the state is unable to obtain the necessary lethal injection drugs within 30 days of a scheduled execution.

Utah is the only state besides Nevada to have ever used the firing squad. South Carolina and Oklahoma are the only other states currently allowing firing squads, with Oklahoma allowing them solely in the event that lethal injection, nitrogen hypoxia and electrocution are all declared unconstitutional. As of August 2024, five inmates remain on death row following the execution of Taberon Honie and the overturning of Douglas Lovell&#x27;s death sentence.

== Method ==
Following the abolition of the firing squad, lethal injection became the state&#x27;s only means of execution until 2015, and currently the primary method, with the firing squad being added as a backup method because of pharmaceutical companies&#x27; moves to limit the use of their drugs in executions.
Executions in Utah are currently performed at the Utah State Correctional Facility in Salt Lake City, with the first execution being carried out in 2024 in the new execution chamber. Prior to July 2022, they were carried out at the Utah State Prison in Draper. Because the ethics standards of the American Medical Association forbid physician involvement in executions, other healthcare professionals including paramedics and nurses perform executions in Utah. Paramedics and nurses, however, are also forbidden from participation in executions by their own professional organizations&#x27; ethics codes. The prison protects the anonymity of professionals involved in executions, making it impossible for professional organizations to impose sanctions.

==Legal process==
When the prosecution seeks the death penalty, the sentence is decided by the jury and must be unanimous.

In case of a hung jury during the penalty phase of the trial, a life sentence is issued, even if a single juror opposed death (there is no retrial).

The power of clemency with respect to death sentences belongs to the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole, which consists of five members appointed by the governor with consent of the state senate. The governor can only grant a stay of execution not extending beyond the next session of the board.

<text>The U.S. state of Washington enforced capital punishment until the state&#x27;s capital punishment statute was declared null and void and abolished in practice by a state Supreme Court ruling on October 11, 2018. The court ruled that it was unconstitutional as applied due to racial bias; however, it did not render the wider institution of capital punishment unconstitutional and rather required the statute to be amended to eliminate racial biases. From 1904 to 2010, 78 people were executed by the state; the last was Cal Coburn Brown on September 10, 2010. In April 2023, Governor Jay Inslee signed SB5087 which formally abolished capital punishment in Washington State and removed provisions for capital punishment from state law.

== Legal process ==
When the prosecution sought the death penalty, the sentence was decided by the jury and had to be unanimous.

In case of a hung jury during the penalty phase of the trial, a life sentence would be issued, even if a single juror opposed death (there was no retrial).

The governor had the power of clemency with respect to death sentences.

== Capital crimes ==
The following were considered circumstances for aggravated first degree murder:
#The victim was a law enforcement officer, corrections officer, or firefighter who was performing his or her official duties at the time of the act resulting in death and the victim was known or reasonably should have been known by the person to be such at the time of the killing.
#At the time of the act resulting in the death, the person was serving a term of imprisonment, had escaped, or was on authorized or unauthorized leave in or from a state facility or program for the incarceration or treatment of persons adjudicated guilty of crimes.
#At the time of the act resulting in death, the person was in custody in a county or county-city jail as a consequence of having been adjudicated guilty of a felony;
#The person committed the murder pursuant to an agreement that he or she would receive money or any other thing of value for committing the murder.
#The person solicited another person to commit the murder and had paid or had agreed to pay money or any other thing of value for committing the murder.
#The person committed the murder to obtain or maintain his or her membership or to advance his or her position in the hierarchy of an organization, association, or identifiable group.
#The murder was committed during the course of or as a result of a shooting where the discharge of the firearm, is either from a motor vehicle or from the immediate area of a motor vehicle that was used to transport the shooter or the firearm, or both, to the scene of the discharge.
#The victim was a judge; juror or former juror; prospective, current, or former witness in an adjudicative proceeding; prosecuting attorney; deputy prosecuting attorney; defense attorney; a member of the indeterminate sentence review board; or a probation or parole officer; and the murder was related to the exercise of official duties performed or to be performed by the victim.
#The person committed the murder to conceal the commission of a crime or to protect or conceal the identity of any person committing a crime including, but specifically not limited to, any attempt to avoid prosecution as a persistent offender.
#There was more than one victim and the murders were part of a common scheme or plan or the result of a single act of the person.
#The murder was committed in the course of, in furtherance of, or in immediate flight from robbery in the first or second degree, rape in the first or second degree, burglary in the first or second degree or residential burglary, kidnapping in the first degree, or arson in the first degree.
#The victim was regularly employed or self-employed as a newsreporter and the murder was committed to obstruct or hinder the investigative, research, or reporting activities of the victim.
#At the time the person committed the murder, there existed a court order, issued in this or any other state, which prohibited the person from either contacting the victim, molesting the victim, or disturbing the peace of the victim, and the person had knowledge of the existence of that order.
#At the time the person committed the murder, the person and the victim were &quot;family or household members&quot; as that term is defined by law, and the person had previously engaged in a pattern or practice of three or more of the following crimes committed upon the victim within a five-year period, regardless of whether a conviction was a result of harassment or any criminal assault.

== Method ==
Death Row for males was located at Washington State Penitentiary at Walla Walla, which was also the site of executions. Females were housed at Washington Corrections Center for Women at Purdy near Gig Harbor while awaiting execution.

Following the reintroduction of capital punishment in the late 1970s, inmates were able to choose if their execution will be carried out by lethal injection or hanging. If the inmate made no decision, lethal injection was the default method. Washington was the last state with an active gallows (Delaware dismantled theirs in 2003).

According to the Revised Code of Washington § 10.95.180, executions in Washington:
...shall be inflicted by intravenous injection of a substance or substances in a lethal quantity sufficient to cause death and until the defendant is dead, or, at the election of the defendant, by hanging by the neck until the defendant is dead.

Mitchell Rupe attempted to have his execution overturned due to the fact that his obesity could decapitate him, thus leading to his execution being cruel and unusual. The court held that the science behind the method of hanging was insufficient to mitigate the likelihood of decapitation. Charles Rodman Campbell declined to choose his method of execution, thus the method defaulted to hanging (which was the default method at the time). His execution was carried out without incident.

On September 10, 2010, Washington became the second state, after Ohio, to use a single dose injection of sodium thiopental as opposed to the typical three drug protocol used in most other jurisdictions. The single-drug protocol was used during the execution of Cal Coburn Brown.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
A total of 110 executions have been carried out in the state and its predecessor territories since 1849. All but the most recent three were by hanging. As of 2017, the Washington State Department of Corrections listed eight men on death row. The first hangings occurred on January 5, 1849, when Cussas and Quallahworst, two Native Americans, were hanged for murder. Executions are rarely carried out in the state — the most executions in one year was five in 1939, and there was an average of less than one hanging per year between 1849 and 1963.

The death penalty was abolished in 1913 and reinstated in 1919. The statute remained unchanged until 1975, when the people adopted a measure providing a mandatory death sentence for aggravated murder, with 69% of voters in favor.

U.S. Supreme Court rulings in &quot;Woodson v. North Carolina&quot;, and &quot;Roberts v. Louisiana&quot;, , , meant that such a law was unconstitutional and the statute was modified to give detailed procedures for imposing the death penalty.

This new law was itself found unconstitutional by the Washington Supreme Court, as a person who had pleaded not guilty could be sentenced to death, while someone who pleaded guilty would receive a maximum sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of parole. The current law was passed in 1981 to correct these constitutional defects.

In 1995, Washington Supreme Court Justice Robert F. Utter resigned in protest of the court&#x27;s handling of capital punishment, stating &quot;I have reached the point where I can no longer participate in a legal system that intentionally takes human life in capital punishment cases”.

===Abolition===
On February 11, 2014, Governor Jay Inslee announced a capital punishment moratorium. All death penalty cases that come to Inslee will result in him issuing a reprieve, not a pardon or commutation.

On January 16, 2017, Governor Inslee and Attorney General Bob Ferguson introduced legislation to abolish the death penalty in Washington state. Though the legislation failed to pass, Governor Inslee stated a commitment to ending capital punishment in the future.

On October 11, 2018, the Washington Supreme Court found that the state&#x27;s current death penalty statute violated the Constitution of Washington, on the ground that it resulted in racial bias, thus abolishing capital punishment in the state. All of the court&#x27;s members agreed in the result. In State v. Gregory, represented by civil rights attorneys Lila Silverstein and Neil Fox, the court based its conclusions on a regression analysis by University of Washington sociologist Katherine Beckett which had been commissioned by a condemned prisoner.

The eight inmates that were on death row at the time of ruling had their sentences converted to life in prison. The State Supreme Court did not rule out the possibility that the state legislature could enact a constitutional death penalty statute in the future.

In April 2023, Governor Inslee signed SB 5087, which formally abolished capital punishment in Washington state and removed provisions for capital punishment from state law.

== Debate ==
In 2004, the Washington State Bar Association&#x27;s Council on Public Defense chartered a sub-committee to examine &quot;the practical wisdom of continuing to pursue death penalty prosecutions in light of Washington&#x27;s experience with sentence reversals, potential benefits to the criminal justice system from cost savings&quot; and other matters. Made up of both opponents and advocates, the subcommittee issued its final report in December 2006. Noting the extra costs associated with capital trials and great disparities in the current system, the report suggested that compensation for attorneys be increased, with all defense and prosecution costs to be paid by the state.

Support for the death penalty in the United States is at historic lows. In a 2017 end of the year report, the Death Penalty Information Center reported that public support of the death penalty reached 45 year lows. In Washington state, Jay Inslee&#x27;s decision to institute a moratorium on capital punishment did not negatively impact his support among voters, as evidenced by the fact that he won the 2016 gubernatorial race (54.4%) by a larger margin than the 2012 race (51.2%). Inslee won by an even larger margin in 2020 (56.6%), running against a pro-capital punishment candidate for the first time.

<text>The following is a list of people executed by the [[U.S. state]] of [[Pennsylvania]].

Since the reinstatement of the death penalty by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1976, 3 men, all convicted of murder, have been executed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. All were executed by lethal injection, and in all cases, they waived their appeals and asked that the execution be carried out.

A total of 1,043 people have been executed in Pennsylvania since 1693, the third highest of any other state or commonwealth in the Union, after New York (1,130) and Virginia (1,361).

Until 1915, hanging was the common method of execution. 1915 saw the first use of the electric chair, even though it was approved by the Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1913. The delay was due to the time needed to finish the Western Penitentiary in Centre County, now the State Correctional Institution – Rockview. On November 29, 1990, Governor Casey changed the form of execution to lethal injection.

The last person to be publicly executed in Pennsylvania was Charles Getter, who was hanged on Getter&#x27;s Island on January 11, 1833.

<doc id="413906" wikidata="Q2858794" url="?curid=413906" title="Capital punishment in Maryland">
<text>Capital punishment was abolished via the legislative process on May 2, 2013, in the U.S. state of Maryland.

The death penalty had been in use in the state or, more precisely, its predecessor colony since June 20, 1638, when two men were hanged for piracy in St. Mary&#x27;s County. A total of 309 people were executed by a variety of methods from 1638 to June 9, 1961, the last execution before &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot;. Since that time, five people have been executed.

The &quot;Death Row&quot; for men was in the North Branch Correctional Institution in Western Maryland&#x27;s Cumberland area. The execution chamber was in the Metropolitan Transition Center (the former Maryland Penitentiary) in Baltimore. The five men who were on the State&#x27;s &quot;death row&quot; were moved in June 2010 from the Maryland Correctional Adjustment Center.

== Early history ==

Up until the second half the 20th century, most executions were by hanging. The exceptions were a soldier shot for desertion, two slaves hanged in chains, and one female slave who was burned at the stake. All hangings were performed in public in the county where the offense took place.

In 1809, the Maryland legislature enacted laws that provided for murder in varying degrees. The mandatory punishment for first-degree murder was given as death. New laws came into force in 1908 which allowed the sentencing judge discretion, giving the option of life imprisonment. Then in 1916, the jury was given the option of deciding if they wished to impose the death penalty during their deliberations. They could now return a sentence of guilty &quot;without capital punishment.&quot;

It was not uncommon for photographers to capture the final moments of a Maryland convict and offer these photos for sale following the execution. For example, on October 20, 1905, John M. Simpers was executed for murdering Albert Constable. A photographer permanently captured that autumn scene in a series of shots.

This changed under new state laws in 1922, which required all hangings to be executed at the Metropolitan Transition Center (formerly known as the Maryland State Penitentiary) in Baltimore. It was designed to get rid of &quot;the curious mobs that frequent hangings taking place in the counties of this State, and who attempt to make public affairs of the same.&quot; 75 men were hanged on the Penitentiary gallows. Of these, 12 hangings were double hangings and on two occasions triple hangings took place. The first indoor hanging in the state, would come before this time though, with an execution on January 3, 1913, in the Baltimore City Jail, which only had invited guests present.

There is one known instance of a botched execution by hanging. On January 30, 1930, Jack Johnson stood on the trapdoor after being convicted of a double murder. But as he fell through, the rope snapped and he fell to the ground below. He was left badly injured and carried to the top of the gallows on a stretcher. There, a new rope was placed around his neck and he was hanged, supported by a stretcher.

The Maryland government decided in 1955 to change the method of execution to the use of gas inhalation. A total of four men were executed by this method, the first on June 28, 1957.

== Recent history ==
After the &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot; decision of the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that death penalty statutes were unconstitutionally arbitrary in their application, the Maryland legislature removed all arbitrariness by making death the mandatory punishment for first-degree murder once again. Such laws were found by the Supreme Court to be unconstitutional in &quot;Woodson v. North Carolina&quot;. As such, the Maryland legislature took the route which the Supreme Court had found acceptable in &quot;Gregg v. Georgia&quot; and introduced bifurcated trials, where the jury first decided guilt and then punishment, mandatory appellate review, and the weighing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances. Further laws changes in 1987 and 1989 excluded juveniles and people who had intellectual disabilities from execution.

The first person to be sentenced to death under Maryland&#x27;s current statute was Richard Danny Tichnell, who was found guilty of murdering Garrett County Sheriff&#x27;s Deputy David Livengood in 1979. Tichnell&#x27;s sentence was overturned on appeal, as were two successive death sentences that prosecutors won against him. A fourth jury declined to impose the death penalty, and Tichnell died in 2006 of natural causes while serving a life sentence.

In 1994, the method was changed to lethal injection for persons convicted after March 25, 1994. For persons sentenced before March 25, 1994, the condemned is given the choice between lethal injection and gas inhalation. John Thanos was put to death using lethal injection on May 16, 1994. This was the first execution in Maryland in over 30 years.

Governor Parris N. Glendening halted executions in Maryland by executive order on May 9, 2002, while a state-ordered University of Maryland, College Park study of capital punishment was conducted. The subsequent governor, Robert Ehrlich, ended the moratorium and resumed executions in 2004.

=== Administrative law challenge ===
In 2006, the Maryland Court of Appeals in &quot;Evans v. Maryland&quot; ruled that state executions would be suspended because the manual that spells out the protocol for lethal injections was not adopted using the process required by the state Administrative Procedures Act (APA). The state APA requires state administrative agencies to adopt regulations, which are defined as statements that have general application and are adopted by an agency to detail or carry out a law that the agency administers, using a process that includes a review by the Attorney General, review by a legislative committee, and publication for public notice and comment. The state&#x27;s Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services had adopted the manual without following any of these activities. The Court of Appeals noted that the procedures for execution in the manual were clearly regulations, and because they had not been properly adopted, they could not be used until they had been either adopted as required by the APA or the state law was changed. The ruling in &quot;Evans&quot;, while not significant from an administrative law aspect as it was consistent with state case law, prevented executions until an agreement was reached regarding both the need for the death penalty and in the method and procedure to be used to carry it out.

=== Abolition ===
The Maryland General Assembly in 2008 established the Maryland Commission on Capital Punishment to provide recommendations concerning the application and administration of capital punishment in the state so that they are free from bias and error and achieve fairness and accuracy. Following a series of public hearings, the Commission submitted its final report, along with a minority report, to the General Assembly on December 12, 2008, which &quot;strongly recommends that capital punishment be abolished in Maryland.&quot;

On March 6, 2013, the Maryland State Senate voted 27–20 in favor of SB 276, a bill to repeal the death penalty for future offenders. On March 15, 2013, the House approved the legislation by an 82–56 vote and sent the bill to Governor Martin O&#x27;Malley, who then signed it into law on May 2, 2013, declaring Maryland the 18th state in the US to ban the death penalty.

At the time of the repeal, only five inmates were on death row in Maryland: John Booth-El, Vernon Lee Evans, Anthony Grandison, Heath William Burch, and Jody Lee Miles. As the repeal was not retroactive, their death sentences were left in limbo. On April 27, 2014, staff found Booth-El dead in his cell. He died of natural causes before his fate was determined, after spending nearly three decades on death row. O&#x27;Malley announced on December 31, 2014, that he would commute the sentences of the four remaining death-row inmates to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

=== Federal execution ===
Maryland&#x27;s stance on capital punishment garnered attention and significance in January 2021. Dustin Higgs, a man sentenced to death by the United States federal government in 2000, was executed on January 16, 2021. Higgs, the first person from Maryland to be sentenced to death in the federal court system, was tried by the federal government (in addition to the state of Maryland) because the crime he was convicted of took place on federal land at the Patuxent Research Refuge in Prince George&#x27;s County. Maryland House of Delegates Speaker Adrienne A. Jones had urged Governor Larry Hogan to intervene and push for a halt to the execution. The execution was carried out on January 16, 2021, via lethal injection.

== Former status ==
Maryland has not had a death penalty since Gov. Martin O&#x27;Malley signed a bill on May 2, 2013. Before the Governor signed the bill, only first-degree murder was a capital offense in the state of Maryland when it involved one of the following aggravating factors:
#The murder was committed against a law enforcement officer while the officer was performing the officer&#x27;s duties; 
#The defendant committed the murder while confined in a correctional facility; 
#The defendant committed the murder in furtherance of an escape from, an attempt to escape from, or an attempt to evade lawful arrest, custody, or detention by a guard or officer of a correctional facility; or a law enforcement officer; 
#The victim was taken or attempted to be taken in the course of an abduction, kidnapping, or an attempt to abduct or kidnap; 
#The victim was a child abducted; 
#The defendant committed the murder under an agreement or contract for remuneration or promise of remuneration to commit the murder; 
#The defendant employed or engaged another to commit the murder and the murder was committed under an agreement or contract for remuneration or promise of remuneration; 
#The defendant committed the murder while under a sentence of death or imprisonment for life; 
#The defendant committed more than one murder in the first degree arising out of the same incident; or 
#The defendant committed the murder while committing, or attempting to commit arson in the first degree, carjacking or armed carjacking, rape in the first degree, robbery, or sexual offense in the first degree.

Under Criminal Law § 2–303, the sentence of death is imposed:

The lethal injection procedure used in Maryland consisted of the anesthetic drug sodium pentothal, followed by the paralytic drug pancuronium bromide, which is also known as Pavulon, and lastly a drug which stops the heart, potassium chloride. The execution is completed when, using an electrocardiogram, a physician declares the convict to be dead.

Unlike most states, Maryland did not offer the condemned a special last meal; instead the prisoner received whatever food the general prison population is served the day of the convict&#x27;s death.

<doc id="413907" wikidata="Q2858800" url="?curid=413907" title="Capital punishment in Nebraska">
<text>Capital punishment is a legal penalty in the U.S. state of Nebraska. In 2015, the state legislature voted to repeal the death penalty, overriding governor Pete Ricketts&#x27; veto. However, a petition drive secured enough signatures to suspend the repeal until a public vote. In the November 2016 general election, voters rejected the repeal measure, preserving capital punishment in the state. Nebraska currently has 11 inmates on death row.

On August 14, 2018, Nebraska executed Carey Dean Moore, convicted of murder, in what was the state&#x27;s first execution in 21 years, and the first by lethal injection. Moore’s execution was also notable for being the first in the US to be carried-out using fentanyl, a powerful opioid painkiller.

==History ==

Hanging was the method of execution in Nebraska until the execution of Albert Prince in 1913. After Prince&#x27;s execution, a new law was passed requiring the use of the electric chair. Allen Grammer was the first person executed by electrocution in Nebraska (his partner in crime, Alson Cole, would be executed 13 minutes later).

In 1959, the state electrocuted Charles Starkweather, who killed 11 people in a two-month murder spree.

On February 8, 2008, the Nebraska Supreme Court declared in &quot;State v. Mata&quot; that electrocution constitutes a &quot;cruel and unusual punishment&quot; under the Nebraska Constitution. The state legislature subsequently approved a bill to change its method of execution to lethal injection, which was signed by governor Dave Heineman on May 28, 2009. Nebraska was the last state to adopt lethal injection as its execution method. The first execution in these states using the method was carried out on August 14, 2018.

A total of 38 individuals have been executed in Nebraska, including four after 1976, when the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of capital punishment in &quot;Gregg v. Georgia&quot;.

In August 2018, Carey Dean Moore was executed by lethal injection for the murders of cabdrivers Maynard Helgeland and Reuel Van Ness Jr. in 1979.

===Sodium thiopental issue===
In 2011 and 2012, state officials imported sodium thiopental on two occasions from suppliers based in India and Switzerland. The suppliers said they discovered only after delivering the drugs that these would be used in executions, prompting them to demand the return of the chemicals. The state refused, and engaged in a legal battle with the United States FDA and the suppliers to keep them. Since the drugs expired in 2013 and became unusable, the state was unable to carry out any execution until it found another way to obtain the chemicals. The state later replaced thiopental with fentanyl as an execution drug.

==2015 repeal==
In May 2015, the unicameral Nebraska State Legislature voted 32–15 on a measure to abolish the death penalty in the state. The bill was introduced by senator Ernie Chambers, an African-American from Omaha, who had introduced similar pieces of legislation over prior decades. Governor Pete Ricketts vetoed the legislation, but the legislature voted 30–19 to override the veto.

In the summer of 2015, an organization called &quot;Nebraskans for the Death Penalty&quot;, gathered signatures on a petition to repeal the bill. Ricketts and his father, Joe Ricketts, contributed one third of the $913,000 raised by the group. The petition&#x27;s organizers submitted 120,479 valid signatures, more than 10% of the registered voters in the state, and thus sufficient to suspend the bill and preserve the death penalty until a public vote could be held.

Death penalty opponents then filed a lawsuit to cancel the referendum, arguing that Ricketts was the &quot;primary initiating force&quot; for the measure, and should have been included on the list of sponsors required by state law. In February 2016, a Lancaster County District Judge dismissed the lawsuit; in July 2016, the Nebraska Supreme Court affirmed the District Court&#x27;s dismissal. 
After this defeat, death penalty opponents began a campaign to retain the repeal bill, and changed their name from &quot;Nebraskans for Public Safety&quot; to &quot;Retain a Just Nebraska&quot;. 

In the November 2016 general election, the death penalty repeal was rejected by a 61–39 margin, thereby retaining capital punishment in the state.

==Current legislation==

===Legal process===
Nebraska is the only state where a sentence of death is decided by a three-judge panel, after a trial finds the defendant eligible for the death penalty.

The panel includes the presiding judge of the trial and two others judges appointed for that purpose by the state&#x27;s chief justice. The death sentence must be unanimous, otherwise life imprisonment is imposed.

Clemency is decided by a three-member board comprising the governor, the attorney general and the secretary of state.

Death row inmates are housed at Tecumseh State Correctional Institution (for males) and Nebraska Correctional Center for Women (for females). Executions have been carried out at Nebraska State Penitentiary (Lincoln) since 1903.

===Capital offenses===
Aggravating factors making murder punishable by death are the following:
#The offender was previously convicted of another murder or a crime involving the use or threat of violence to the person, or has a substantial prior history of serious assaultive or terrorizing criminal activity;
#The murder was committed in an effort to conceal the commission of a crime, or to conceal the identity of the perpetrator of such crime;
#The murder was committed for hire, or for pecuniary gain, or the defendant hired another to commit the murder for the defendant;
#The murder was especially heinous, atrocious, cruel, or manifested exceptional depravity by ordinary standards of morality and intelligence;
#At the time the murder was committed, the offender also committed another murder;
#The offender knowingly created a great risk of death to at least several persons;
#The victim was a public servant having lawful custody of the offender or another in the lawful performance of his or her official duties and the offender knew or should have known that the victim was a public servant performing his or her official duties;
#The murder was committed knowingly to disrupt or hinder the lawful exercise of any governmental function or the enforcement of the laws;
#The victim was a law enforcement officer engaged in the lawful performance of his or her official duties as a law enforcement officer and the offender knew or reasonably should have known that the victim was a law enforcement officer.

<text>Ballard Down is an area of chalk downland on the Purbeck Hills in the English county of Dorset. The hills meet the English Channel here, and Ballard Down forms a headland, Ballard Point, between Studland Bay to the north and Swanage Bay to the south. The chalk here forms part of a system of chalk downlands in southern England, and once formed a continuous ridge between what is now west Dorset and the present day Isle of Wight. Old Harry Rocks, just offshore from the dip slope of the down, and The Needles on the westernmost tip of the Isle of Wight, are remnants of this ridge. The scarp slope of the down faces south, over Swanage, meeting the sea as Ballard Cliff.

The down was an area of calcareous grassland for up to 1000 years until World War II, when there was a sudden rise in the need for arable agricultural land. The down is now owned by the National Trust, and has largely been returned to grassland. The National Trust allows grazing on the down to prevent it becoming a natural beech woodland climax community.

The obelisk at Ballard Down commemorates the provision of a new supply of drinking water for Swanage in 1883. Erected in 1892 by George Burt, it was taken down in 1941 as it was a landmark that might have aided enemy aircraft during World War II, but was re-erected in 1952.

Ballard Down forms the easternmost part of the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site.

The BBC&#x27;s adaptation of EM Forster&#x27;s novel &#x27;Howards End&#x27; (2017) used Ballard Down as a location.

<text>William Stanley Mazeroski (born September 5, 1936), nicknamed &quot;Maz&quot; and &quot;the Glove&quot;, is an American former second baseman in Major League Baseball (MLB) who played his entire career for the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1956 to 1972. A seven-time All-Star known during his career primarily for his spectacular defensive play, he has come to be better known for perhaps the most memorable home run in baseball history, a dramatic ninth-inning drive in Game 7 of the 1960 World Series that beat the favored New York Yankees. It was the first time that the major league season ended with a home run, and remains the only walk-off home run to clinch a World Series championship in Game 7. ESPN ranked the World Series winner at the top of its list of the 100 Greatest Home Runs of All Time, while &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; had it eighth in its compilation of the 100 Greatest Moments in Sports History. Mazeroski received the Babe Ruth Award for his play in the Series, during which he batted .320.

An eight-time Gold Glove Award winner, Mazeroski was particularly noted for his ability to make the pivot in turning double plays. His 1,706 career double plays remain a major league record for a second baseman, and were the most by any non-first baseman in history until shortstop Omar Vizquel passed him in 2009. Mazeroski led the National League (NL) in double plays eight consecutive years, and recorded over 100 double plays eleven times, both also major league records. His 161 double plays in 1966 remain the major league record for second basemen; when he retired, he held the top three marks in NL history. He led the major leagues in assists a record nine times, and led the NL in putouts five times and in fielding percentage three times. Mazeroski set NL records for career games (2,094), putouts (4,974), assists (6,685) and total chances (11,863) by a second baseman, all of which were later broken by Joe Morgan; his career fielding percentage of .983 ranked second in NL history when he retired, less than a quarter of a point behind Red Schoendienst.

Mazeroski also provided contributions on offense which were not typical for his position; his 138 career home runs and 853 runs batted in (RBI) were the most by any second baseman during the period between 1944 and 1974, with his home run total putting him behind only Rogers Hornsby among NL second basemen when his career ended. His home run production was particularly impressive due to the Pirates playing in cavernous Forbes Field, where the distant reaches in left and center field made it typically the league&#x27;s most difficult home run stadium until the mid-1960s; Mazeroski hit more than twice as many homers on the road (93) than at home (45) in his career. He closed out his career by helping the Pirates to three consecutive division titles; he and Roberto Clemente were the only members of the 1960 champions who were on the team when they picked up another title in , beating the favored Baltimore Orioles in seven games. Mazeroski later became a coach for the Pirates and the Seattle Mariners. The Pirates organization retired his uniform number in 1987; he is now the only living person so honored. Mazeroski was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2001.

==Formative years==
Mazeroski was born in Wheeling, West Virginia to a Polish-American family. His parents were Mayme and Louis Mazeroski who resided in nearby Witch Hazel, Ohio. Louis had been a highly regarded baseball prospect himself—he once had a tryout with the Cleveland Indians—but a severed foot suffered in a coal mine accident ruined his dream as well as his livelihood. Along with his parents and sister Mary, Mazeroski grew up in a small one-room house that was devoid of electricity and indoor plumbing. He often went by the name of Catfish because of a penchant for fishing, not because of any real passion for the sport but to put food on the table.

Louis became prone to alcohol, but he wasn&#x27;t about to let his son follow a similar path to the coal mines. The two played catch and talked ball regularly. Their favorite drill was played with a tennis ball, which Louis threw against a brick wall and his son fielded with a glove that had been purchased with money earned from digging an outhouse, as family legend had it. The exercise was designed to sharpen hand-eye coordination and ability to quickly adjust to bad bounces, areas in which young Bill excelled as early as elementary school.

As a child, Mazeroski was a fan of the Cleveland Indians and counted Lou Boudreau, Bob Feller, Ken Keltner and Joe Gordon as his heroes.

Mazeroski attended Warren Consolidated High School in Tiltonsville, Ohio, where he was a multi-sports star, most notably in baseball and basketball. He was a four-year starter with the varsity baseball team, normally as a shortstop or pitcher. In his senior year, he was named Class A 2nd team All-Ohio in basketball.

Mazeroski turned down college scholarship offers from Duquesne, Ohio State and West Virginia to pursue a professional baseball career. In 1954, after several major league teams had courted the infielder, the Indians, Boston Red Sox, Chicago White Sox and Philadelphia Phillies among them, the 17-year-old finally chose the Pirates, largely because they agreed to accelerate his start in Class-A ball unlike the others.

==Professional career==
===Early struggles and rapid ascent===

Success at the pro level did not come easily for Mazeroski at the outset. In 1955, the 17-year-old made his debut with the Class A Williamsport Grays, where he hit .235 in 93 games. He played exclusively at shortstop, where he was charged with 31 errors. The next spring, Pirates general manager Branch Rickey noticed how well he turned the double play as a second baseman, which prompted his move to the right side of the diamond. Mazeroski moved up to the Triple A Hollywood Stars farm club to begin the 1955 season. While he played 20 errorless games at his new position, the two-level jump proved to be too much at the plate. He was sent back to Williamsport, where he got back on track with a .293 batting average and 11 homers in 114 games.

Mazeroski returned to Hollywood at the outset of the 1956 campaign, only this time things were noticeably different. He hit .305 with an .823 OPS (on-base plus slugging) to earn a promotion to the major leagues midway through the season. At a time when the vast majority of young athletes were required to hone their skills in the minors for several years, Mazeroski got the call at 19 years of age. As expected, the transition was not a seamless one.

He made his first big league appearance on July 7, 1956, against the New York Giants at the Polo Grounds in New York. His first hit was a single off Johnny Antonelli in his first at bat. But for most of the next five weeks, his batting average tumbled below the .200 mark; he hit his first home run on August 16, a 2-run shot off Robin Roberts in the fourth inning, to lead the Pirates to a 4-1 road win over the Phillies. But a few days later, Pirates manager Bobby Bragan dropped him behind the pitcher in the batting order for 10 games. Mazeroski regrouped to hit .243 in 81 games, but later conceded that the drop in the lineup had an adverse effect on his confidence at the plate early in his career.

After Danny Murtaugh replaced Bragan at the helm in early August 1957, Mazeroski and the Pirates showed immediate and steady improvement. &quot;Baseball men are saying that Mazeroski, with his great hands and range and arm, is perhaps the finest young infielder in the business,&quot; &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; reported in its 1958 preseason analysis.

In 1958, the young Bucs promptly stunned the baseball world with a second-place finish, while Mazeroski blossomed into an All-Star for the first time in his career. His 19 home runs and 69 RBI each ranked second at his position in the major leagues. He also was selected for his first Gold Glove Award. His father Louis died of lung cancer early the next year, but not before he had witnessed his son achieve stardom.

===Second to none===
Soon Pirates broadcaster Bob Prince began referring to Mazeroski as simply &quot;The Glove&quot;, as the perennial Gold Glove candidate set the bar for defense at his position that would still be in place decades later. Houston Astros and future Hall of Fame second baseman Joe Morgan called him &quot;the gold standard&quot; for infield defense.

Mazeroski turned the double play into an art form with Gene Kelly-like footwork, magical hands, sure arm and exceptionally strong legs that survived countless attempts by baserunners to break up the play. Coupled with acute baseball instincts, he displayed unparalleled range in the field, as evidenced by the nine seasons that he led the league in assists per nine innings; recent analytics credit him similarly in total zone runs at the position. Remarkably, Mazeroski was able to accomplish this even though he played nearly half of his games at Forbes Field, whose infield was widely thought to be the worst in the majors because of its alabaster-like surface and many errant hops.

What also made Mazeroski unique was his trademark glove, which wasn&#x27;t much larger than his right hand. Its compactness allowed for a quicker grip, ball transfer and release, especially on double play attempts. Once broken in, the piece of equipment would see action for several years at a time.

&quot;Maz never really caught the ball, never really closed his glove over it turning the double play,&quot; said Pirates shortstop Gene Alley, who assisted Mazeroski on many of his 161 double plays in the 1966 season, still a major league record. &quot;He could tilt his glove at an angle and hold his hand just so. It was a wonder the ball stayed in there. Then it would slide out in his hand just like that. He was the only one I ever saw do it like that.&quot;

Five decades after Mazeroski played his final game, he still holds the major league records for second basemen for most double plays in a season (161), most double plays in a career (1,706), most years leading the league in twin killings (eight) and most seasons leading in assists (nine). His 543 assists in 1964 were the most by any second baseman between 1938 and 1983.

Said Dick Groat, Mazeroski&#x27;s first double-play partner in the big leagues, &quot;He had marvelous range, great instincts and never threw to the wrong base. His release on the double play was phenomenal. When Maz was a kid, I had a couple of years&#x27; experience on him. If I would move Maz and tell him to play here or play there, I never had to tell him a second time. Ever.&quot;

Mazeroski also was known for extraordinary durability, especially given the physical demands of the second base position and chronic lower body issues later in his career. In a span of 12 seasons (1957-1968), he started 150 or more games seven times and at least 129 in each one. In 1966 and 1967, the iron man was in the field for all except 32 of a possible innings.

In 1961, Mazeroski recorded 144 double plays, breaking the NL record of 137 shared by Jackie Robinson and Red Schoendienst. On April 28, 1966, Mazeroski became the second NL player to hit 100 home runs as a second baseman when he took Chicago Cubs starter Ferguson Jenkins deep in a 9-6, 10-inning road win. Later that year, he shattered Jerry Priddy&#x27;s single-season major league record of 150 double plays at second base, which was set with the Detroit Tigers in the 1950 campaign. In 1967, Mazeroski broke Schoendienst&#x27;s NL record of 1,368 career double plays. On August 19, 1968, in an 8-3 road loss to the Cincinnati Reds, he broke Schoendienst&#x27;s league record of 1,834 games at second base. In 1969, he broke Frankie Frisch&#x27;s NL record of 6,026 assists and Billy Herman&#x27;s league record of 10,815 total chances; in 1970, he broke Nellie Fox&#x27;s major league record of 1,619 double plays, and Herman&#x27;s NL record of 4,780 putouts.

In the second game of a doubleheader on June 28, 1970, in the final game played at Forbes Field, Mazeroski fielded a Don Kessinger ground ball near second base and stepped on the bag to force out Willie Smith for the final out in a 4-1 victory over the Cubs. On July 16, he fielded the first batted ball in the history of Three Rivers Stadium, a ground ball off the bat of Ty Cline that opened a 3-2 loss to the Reds. On August 17, 1971, Mazeroski doubled in the second inning of a 6-5 loss to the Houston Astros for his 2,000th career hit. On July 23, 1972 against the Reds, he singled in the first inning of a 3-2 win; it was the last regular-season hit of his career, as he went hitless in his final 30 at bats as his playing time was gradually reduced to occasional pinch hitting.

At the end of his career, Mazeroski ranked fourth in Pirates history in games played (2,163), fifth in home runs (138) and at bats (7,755), sixth in RBI (853) and doubles (294), and seventh in hits (2,016) and total bases (2,848). Modern sabermetrics credit him with 27.6 Wins Above Replacement (WAR) in the 1960s, the most of any major leaguer at his position. Joe Morgan broke Mazeroski&#x27;s NL record for games at second base on September 28, 1980, his record for putouts in 1981, his record for total chances in 1982 and his record for assists in 1983.

=== The home run of all home runs ===

On the heels of a subpar season for Mazeroski and his fourth-place team, the 1960 campaign exceeded the wildest dreams of Pittsburgh sports fans. The Battlin&#x27; Bucs, as they would become known, dominated the National League virtually from the start to claim their first pennant since the 1927 season. Meanwhile, Mazeroski was an NL starter in both All-Star Games.

The Pirates seized control of the pennant race in August, when they won 21 of 31 games with Mazeroski in a lead role. He hit .373, drove in 16 runs and had a 26-game errorless streak in the month. The team was rewarded with a trip to the 1960 World Series, where the second baseman forged his legacy against the New York Yankees with a pair of game-winning home runs. The second came on October 13 off reliever Ralph Terry at Forbes Field, the only homer to end a World Series in major league history until 1993.

One of the wildest games in baseball history got wilder yet in the top of the ninth inning, when the Yankees plated two runs to forge a 9-9 deadlock. At that point, Mazeroski admittedly got caught up in the sudden turn of events. It seemed the second baseman had forgotten that he was to lead off the bottom half of the inning, and it wasn&#x27;t until first base coach Lenny Levy reminded him of the fact that he hurriedly picked up a bat.

At precisely 3:36 p.m. local time, on a 1-0 count, Mazeroski slammed Terry&#x27;s high fastball just to the left of the 406-foot marker in distant left-center field. &quot;Here&#x27;s a swing and a high fly ball going deep to left! This may do it!&quot; NBC Radio broadcaster Chuck Thompson told the national audience. &quot;Back to the wall goes (Yogi) Berra ... It is over the fence -- home run! The Pirates win! ... Ladies and gentlemen, Mazeroski has hit a one-nothing pitch over the left field fence at Forbes Field to win the 1960 World Series for the Pittsburgh Pirates!&quot;

&quot;I thought it would go over (the wall). I was hoping it would,&quot; Mazeroski told reporters in the jubilant home team clubhouse afterward. &quot;But I was too happy to think. All year we&#x27;ve been a fighting, come-from-behind ballclub. We always felt we could pull it out even after the Yankees tied it in the ninth, but I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be the guy to do it.&quot; The legendary homer gave the Pirates their first World Series championship in 35 years and set off a raucous celebration in the Steel City that lasted for days.

&quot;I was almost at second base when (the ball) finally went over,&quot; Mazeroski said. &quot;I was running so hard, just trying to make sure I&#x27;d get to third. Then it took a moment or two to realize what happened -- it was gone.&quot; At that point, Mazeroski finished his sprint around the bases like a giddy schoolboy before he was mobbed at home plate. &quot;You know, all I could think about was, &quot;We beat the Yankeesǃ We beat themǃ We beat the damn Yankeesǃ&quot; he said.

Fourteen-year-old Andy Jerpe retrieved the ball amid the cherry trees in Schenley Park, which was adjacent to the ballpark. After taking pictures with the ball for the gathered press, Mazeroski signed the ball for him in the clubhouse and told him, &quot;Keep it. The memory&#x27;s good enough for me,&quot; but the keepsake was lost during a neighborhood game a short time later.

The Game 7 homer marked the third game-winning hit for Mazeroski in the series. In the fourth inning of Game 1, with Don Hoak on base, he hit a two-run homer off reliever Jim Coates that cleared the large scoreboard in straight-away left field. The blow extended Pittsburgh&#x27;s lead to 5–2 and proved to be the difference in a 6–4 victory. In Game 5, Mazeroski rapped a two-run double to left field off Art Ditmar that scored Hoak and Gino Cimoli in the fourth inning. The hit gave his team a 3-0 advantage that held up in a 5-2 triumph. Even though Mazeroski hit .320 with team highs of five RBI, four runs scored and two home runs, Yankees counterpart Bobby Richardson was selected the Most Valuable Player of the series.

In September 2010, a statue of Mazeroski was unveiled outside PNC Park in Pittsburgh, depicting his legendary home run celebration — a runner pose with both arms extended, ball cap in right hand.

The home run was ranked number 2 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;″ list of &quot;Baseball&#x27;s 25 Greatest Moments. In 2020, writing for &quot;The Athletic&quot;, sportswriter Joe Posnanski ranked the home run at number 8 in his series of &quot;60 moments&quot;, a list of most memorable moments in baseball history.

==Triple plays in film and reality==
Mazeroski was the focus of a staged game-ending triple play as part of a cameo appearance in the 1968 film &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;. In the scene, Oscar Madison is distracted from witnessing the play by an annoying phone call from Felix Ungar (immediately after sarcastically predicting to fellow sportswriter Heywood Hale Broun that the Mets still have a chance to win if Mazeroski hits into a triple play). Reportedly, the scene was actually filmed just prior to the start of a regular game at Shea Stadium on June 27, 1967. Maz reported that he was given only 10 minutes to get it done:

Jack Fisher was the pitcher for the Mets in that scene. In reality, Mazeroski never suffered such an inglorious moment during his playing days, but he did record two triple plays as a fielder, both against the Cincinnati Reds. On April 18, 1966, in the seventh inning of a home game, Vada Pinson struck out during a double steal attempt. Catcher Jesse Gonder threw to third baseman Bob Bailey, who then threw to Mazeroski to retire Tommy Harper off second base, and Mazeroski then threw to first baseman Donn Clendenon to retire Pete Rose off first base; the Pirates went on to win 4-3. And on July 31, 1968, in the second game of a doubleheader, Tommy Helms lined out to shortstop Gene Alley in the fourth inning of a 10-1 Pirates victory; Alley threw to Mazeroski, who then threw to Clendenon, retiring Lee May and Tony Pérez before they could return to their bases.

==Hall of Fame selection==
Mazeroski became eligible for the Hall of Fame in 1978, but initially drew little support before gradually gaining in the voting nearly every year; he ran out of initial eligibility in 1992, having never received 50% of the vote. Skeptics pointed to his shortcomings as a hitter; his .299 on-base percentage remains the lowest of any non-pitcher in the Hall, though his power at the plate brings his on-base plus slugging figure more in line with other defensive stars elected previously, including Rabbit Maranville, Ray Schalk and Luis Aparicio. &quot;Newsweek&quot; columnist George Will remarked in 1995, &quot;The exclusion of Mazeroski from Cooperstown is a case of simple discrimination against defensive skills.&quot; Mazeroski was finally elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2001.

On induction day in Cooperstown, Mazeroski only made it as far into his prepared remarks as thanking the Veterans Committee voters for choosing a player based largely on defensive skills (a rarity) before getting so overcome with emotion that he had to stop. Apologizing to those who &quot;had to come all the way up here to hear this crap,&quot; he then sat down to a long and loud standing ovation from the audience and his fellow Hall of Famers.

==Other honors==
In 1979, Mazeroski was inducted into the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame.

In 1995, Harrison Central High School in Cadiz, Ohio had a field donated by Mazeroski which later became known as Mazeroski Field. In 2003, Buckeye Local High School in Rayland (which had since absorbed Warren Consolidated) honored him by naming their new baseball field after him, placing a monument behind home plate in recognition.

In 2004, the Ohio Valley Athletic Conference saluted Mazeroski by electing him among the inaugural members of their Hall of Fame, alongside Boston Celtic great John Havlicek and Olympic wrestler Bobby Douglas.

Mazeroski was recognized by Major League Baseball by being selected to throw out the first pitch of the Home Run Derby that preceded the 2006 All-Star Game at Pittsburgh&#x27;s PNC Park, receiving a long standing ovation. He also was picked to manage the National League during the All-Star Legends and Celebrity Softball Game during the All-Star week celebrations.

In 2022, Mazeroski was inducted as an inaugural member of the Pirates Hall of Fame.

==Life after baseball==
In 1987, Mazeroski ran for the Democratic nomination for County Commissioner in his home of Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania but his bid was unsuccessful.

Mazeroski resides in Panama City, Florida with his wife Milene (nee Nicholson). Milene had been the secretary for Rex Bowen, at the time the head of the scouting department with the Pirates. The couple had two sons. Darren is a retired junior college baseball coach, while Dave is an atmospheric scientist.

In 2010, the 50th anniversary of the 1960 World Series, Mazeroski was to be the guest of honor at the first showing of the original television broadcast of Game 7; it was thought to be lost before it was discovered at the home of Bing Crosby, who had been co-owner of the Pirates throughout Mazeroski&#x27;s career. However, he was unable to attend due to an undisclosed illness that left him hospitalized for several days.

The annual &quot;Bill Mazeroski Golf Tournament&quot; is held each spring. Proceeds from the event go to a baseball scholarship that is awarded to a senior graduate of Buckeye Local High School in Warren Township, which is located near his former high school.

Mazeroski was featured in an FSN Pittsburgh commercial that featured former Pirates first baseman Sean Casey.

<doc id="413915" wikidata="Q106636" url="?curid=413915" title="Bam, Iran">
<text>Bam () is a city in the Central District of Bam County, Kerman province, Iran, serving as capital of both the county and the district.

The modern Iranian city of Bam surrounds the Bam citadel. Before the 2003 earthquake, the official population count of the city was roughly 43,000. There are various opinions about the date and reasons for the foundation of the citadel. Economically and commercially, Bam occupied a very important place in the region and was famous for its textiles and clothes. Ibn Hawqal (943–977), an Arab traveller and geographer, wrote of Bam in his book &quot;Surat-ul-&#x27;Ard&quot; (&quot;The Earth-figure&quot;):

:&quot;Over there they weave excellent, beautiful and long-lasting cotton cloths which are sent to places all over the world. There, they also make excellent clothes, each of which costs around 30 dinars; these are sold in Khorasan, Iraq and Egypt.&quot;

== History ==
===Pre-modern history===
The ancient citadel of Arg-e Bam has a history dating to around 2,000 years ago, to the Parthian Empire (248 BC–224 AD), but most buildings were built during the Safavid dynasty. This citadel was a great tourist attraction for tourists and has been registered as a world heritage site in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.

The city was largely abandoned due to an Afghan invasion led by Mahmud Hotak in 1722. Subsequently, after the city had gradually been re-settled, it was abandoned a second time due to an attack by invaders from Shiraz. It was also used for a time as an army barracks.

=== Modern history ===
The modern city of Bam has gradually developed as an agricultural and industrial centre, and until the 2003 earthquake was experiencing rapid growth. In particular, the city is known for its dates and citrus fruit, irrigated by a substantial network of qanats.

One of the most important agricultural products is Bam Mozafati date, which is famous in Iran and other countries. Mozafati Bam dates with a delicate and rich taste, with a sweet melt and an amazing taste are harvested every year in Darbam in the mountainous region of Iran. No preservatives or chemical additives are added to it. It is a fresh, natural, raw and quality product.

The city also benefited from tourism, with an increasing number of people visiting the ancient citadel in recent years.

The earthquake destroyed or seriously damaged much of the city and killed a large part of the population. Since then, Bam has been in recovery.

===2003 earthquake===

The 2003 Bam earthquake struck Bam and the surrounding Kerman province of south-eastern Iran at 01:56 UTC (5:26 AM Iran Standard Time) on 26 December 2003. The most widely accepted estimate for the magnitude of the earthquake is 6.6 on the moment magnitude scale (Mw); estimated by the United States Geological Survey. The earthquake was particularly destructive, with the death toll amounting to 26,271 people and injuring an additional 30,000. The effects of the earthquake and damage was exacerbated by the fact that the city chiefly consisted of mud brick buildings, many of which did not comply with earthquake regulations set in Iran in 1989, and that most of the city&#x27;s people were indoors and asleep at the time the main tremor struck.

Due to the earthquake, relations between the United States and Iran thawed. Following the earthquake the U.S. offered direct humanitarian assistance to Iran and in return the state promised to comply with an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency which supports greater monitoring of its nuclear interests. In total a reported 44 countries sent in personnel to assist in relief operations and 60 countries offered assistance and support.

===Post-2003 development===
Immediately following the 2003 earthquake, the Iranian government began to plan a new city based on population control theories in order to eliminate problems that existed with the old city. The development of the plan took at least six months and resulted in significant complaints against the central government and local government by the Bam earthquake survivors. Nevertheless, government in Tehran continued its plans and currently the city is being rebuilt. The citadel is also being rebuilt with specialist care from the Ministry of Culture and from Japanese universities. The earthquake was an extreme tragedy and stunted the growth of Bam as a city, especially as about half of the city&#x27;s residents were killed and most of the remainder hurt. Costs of the earthquake mounted to between $700 million and $1 billion U.S. dollars.

===2007 Sandstorm===
On 16 March 2007 a 130 km/h (81 mph) sandstorm hit the city of Bam without warning, suffocating three children, killing two in car accidents, and injuring 14 others.

==Demographics==
===Population===
At the time of the 2006 National Census, the city&#x27;s population was 73,823 in 19,572 households. The following census in 2011 counted 107,131 people in 29,433 households. The 2016 census measured the population of the city as 127,396 people in 39,043 households.

==Climate==

== List of people executed in Missouri since 1976 ==
Since 1989, a total of 101 people were executed by the State of Missouri. All were convicted of first-degree murder and all were executed by lethal injection, although lethal gas remains a legal method of execution. Before April 1989, all executions were carried out at the Missouri State Penitentiary in Jefferson City. Between April 1989 and March 2005, executions were carried out at the Potosi Correctional Center in Mineral Point. Since April 2005, all subsequent executions have been carried out at the Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center in Bonne Terre. A condemned inmate and convicted double killer from Missouri, Lewis Eugene Gilbert, was executed in Oklahoma.

<doc id="413917" wikidata="Q2858811" url="?curid=413917" title="Capital punishment in Oklahoma">
<text>Capital punishment is a legal penalty in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. The state has executed the second-largest number of convicts in the United States (after Texas) since re-legalization following &quot;Gregg v. Georgia &quot; in 1976. Oklahoma also has the highest number of executions per capita in the United States.

Oklahoma was the first jurisdiction in the world to adopt lethal injection as a method of execution.

==Legal process==
When the prosecution seeks the death penalty, the sentence is decided by the jury and must be unanimous. In case of a hung jury during the penalty phase of the trial, a life sentence is issued.

==Capital crimes==
In Oklahoma, first-degree murder is punishable by death in the following circumstances:

# The defendant was previously convicted of a felony involving the use or threat of violence to the person;
# The defendant knowingly created a great risk of death to more than one person;
# The person committed the murder for remuneration or the promise of remuneration or employed another to commit the murder for remuneration or the promise of remuneration;
# The murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel;
# The murder was committed for the purpose of avoiding or preventing a lawful arrest or prosecution;
# The murder was committed by a person while serving a sentence of imprisonment on conviction of a felony;
# The existence of a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society; or
# The victim of the murder was a peace officer, or correctional employee of an institution under the control of the Department of Corrections, and such person was killed while in performance of official duty.

Oklahoma statute books still provide the death penalty for first-degree rape, extortionate kidnapping, and rape or forcible sodomy of a victim under 14 where the defendant had a prior conviction of sexual abuse of a person under 14 but the death penalty for these crimes is no longer constitutional since the 2008 U.S. Supreme Court case &quot;Kennedy v. Louisiana&quot;.

==Clemency==
Under the state Constitution, the Governor of Oklahoma may grant a commutation of the death sentence, but only with advice and consent of the five-member Pardon and Parole Board. Three inmates post-&quot;Furman&quot; had their death sentences commuted.

Governor Lee Cruce commuted every death sentence imposed during his administration (1911–1915).

==Method==
Oklahoma is one of two states (together with Mississippi) which allows more than three methods of execution in its statutes, providing lethal injection which is Oklahoma&#x27;s primary method, nitrogen hypoxia, electrocution and firing squad to be used in that order if all earlier methods are unavailable or found to be unconstitutional. The nitrogen option was added by the Oklahoma Legislature in 2015 and has never been used in the state, only having been used three times in Alabama.

On December 16, 2010, Oklahoma became the first American state to use pentobarbital, in the execution of John David Duty. In 2014, Oklahoma placed scheduled executions on hold until the state&#x27;s Department of Corrections implemented eleven proposed improvements in protocols governing capital punishment. The review of the lethal injection administration process resulted from the protracted 33-minute execution of Clayton Derrell Lockett in which a doctor and a paramedic failed nearly a dozen times to administer an IV with lethal drugs. Executions resumed on January 15, 2015, with the execution of Charles Frederick Warner by lethal injection. Warner was the last man to be executed in Oklahoma for nearly seven years, until October 28, 2021, when John Marion Grant was executed, also by lethal injection.

During Grant&#x27;s execution, he vomited and convulsed after the administration of the lethal injection. Dale Baich, an attorney for death row plaintiffs said, &quot;Based on the reporting of the eyewitnesses to the execution, for the third time in a row, Oklahoma&#x27;s execution protocol did not work as it was designed to. This is why the Tenth Circuit stayed John Grant&#x27;s execution and this is why the U.S. Supreme Court should not have lifted the stay. There should be no more executions in Oklahoma until we go trial in February to address the state&#x27;s problematic lethal injection protocol.&quot; Critics called the execution torture, while a spokesperson for the Oklahoma Department of Corrections defended it, saying &quot;Grant’s execution was carried out in accordance with Oklahoma Department of Corrections’ protocols and without complication.&quot;

Following a multi-county grand jury investigation into Oklahoma&#x27;s execution protocol, the jury recommended that Oklahoma design and begin using a nitrogen hypoxia execution protocol as Oklahoma&#x27;s primary method of execution. After struggling for years to design a nitrogen execution protocol and to obtain a proper device for it, Oklahoma announced in February 2020 that it had abandoned the project after finding a new reliable source of lethal injection drugs, nitrogen hypoxia remains an alternative method.

On November 8, 2016, the people of Oklahoma voted 67–33 in favor of a legislatively referred state constitutional amendment strengthening capital punishment, providing that &quot;any method of execution shall be allowed, unless prohibited by the United States Constitution&quot;.

In January 2022, lawyers for death row inmates Donald Grant and Gilbert Postelle asked for their execution method to be switched from lethal injection to firing squad, arguing that firing squad would be faster and less painful. The state executed both Grant and Postelle by lethal injection on January 27, 2022, and February 17, 2022, respectively.

==Death row==
Oklahoma&#x27;s male death row inmates are housed in the &quot;H&quot; unit of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary (OSP) located in McAlester, Oklahoma. OSP also houses Oklahoma&#x27;s execution chamber. Female death row prisoners are housed at the Mabel Bassett Correctional Center located near McLoud, Oklahoma and are transferred to OSP for their execution. 

, Oklahoma had 30 inmates on death row, of whom only one, Brenda Andrew, is female.

<doc id="413919" wikidata="Q6119204" url="?curid=413919" title="Jacob Ruppert">
<text>Jacob Ruppert Jr. (August 5, 1867 – January 13, 1939) was an American brewer, businessman, National Guard colonel and politician who served for four terms representing New York in the United States House of Representatives from 1899 to 1907. He also owned the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball from 1915 until his death in 1939.

Starting out in the family brewing business, Ruppert entered the 7th Regiment of the New York National Guard in 1886 at the age of 19, eventually reaching the rank of colonel. While he was the owner of the Yankees, he purchased the contract of Babe Ruth and built Yankee Stadium, reversing the franchise&#x27;s fortunes and establishing it as the premier club in the major leagues. Ruppert was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in July 2013.

==Early life==
Ruppert was born in New York City, the son of brewer Jacob Ruppert Sr., and his wife, Anna Ruppert ( Gillig). He was the second oldest of six children. His mother was also of German ethnicity, and was herself the daughter of prominent brewer George Gillig. Although he was a second-generation American, to the day he died he spoke with a noticeable German accent.

Ruppert grew up in the Jacob Ruppert Sr. House on Fifth Avenue. Jacob Jr. attended the Columbia Grammar School. He was accepted into Columbia College, but instead began working in the brewing business with his father in 1887. He started as a barrel washer, working 12-hour days for $10 a week ($ in current dollar terms), and eventually became vice president and general manager of the brewery.

In 1886, Ruppert enlisted in the Seventh Regiment, National Guard of New York, serving in the rank of private through 1889. In 1890, he was promoted to colonel and appointed to serve on the staff of David B. Hill, the Governor of New York, serving as aide-de-camp. He became a senior aide on the staff of Roswell P. Flower, Hill&#x27;s successor as governor, until 1895.

==Career==
===Political and business career===
In the 1898 elections, Ruppert was elected to the United States House of Representatives as a member of the Democratic Party to the 56th United States Congress, defeating incumbent Philip B. Low of the Republican Party in New York&#x27;s 15th congressional district. He was supported in his election by Richard Croker, the political boss of Tammany Hall. Ruppert won reelection over Alderman Elias Goodman in 1900. Ruppert was renominated for Congress, this time running in New York&#x27;s 16th congressional district, in 1902. Ruppert was not a candidate for reelection in 1906, and he left office in 1907.

Ruppert was also president of the Astoria Silk Works and the United States Brewers Association from 1911 through 1914. In January 1914, his father bought J&amp;M Haffen Brewing Company for $700,000 ($ in current dollar terms), intending to close the brewery down and develop the property, which was located near The Hub in The Bronx. Upon his father&#x27;s death in 1915, Ruppert inherited the Jacob Ruppert Brewing Company and became the company&#x27;s president. Ruppert also owned real estate, including Pass-a-Grille Key in Florida.

===Baseball===

Ruppert, interested in baseball since his childhood, began to pursue ownership of a Major League Baseball team and attempted to purchase the New York Giants on numerous occasions. In 1912 he was offered an opportunity to purchase the Chicago Cubs, but decided that Chicago was too far away from New York for his tastes. However, Frank J. Farrell and William S. Devery, owners of the New York Yankees, were looking to sell their franchise. Ruppert and Tillinghast L&#x27;Hommedieu Huston, a former United States Army engineer and colonel, purchased the Yankees from Farrell and Devery before the 1915 season for $480,000 ($ in current dollar terms). The Yankees were, at that time, a perennial also-ran in the American League (AL), posting winning records in only 4 of their 12 seasons – and only once since 1906 – since relocating to New York prior to the 1903 season from Baltimore, where the team had played as the Orioles during the AL&#x27;s first two years of operation, 1901 and 1902.

After the 1917 season, Ban Johnson, president of the AL, suggested that Ruppert hire St. Louis Cardinals manager Miller Huggins to take over the same position with the Yankees. Huston, who was in Europe at the time serving as an engineer in World War 1, disliked Huggins and wanted to hire the manager of the National League&#x27;s crosstown Brooklyn Robins, Wilbert Robinson, his drinking buddy. However, Ruppert interviewed Huggins on Johnson&#x27;s recommendation, and agreed that Huggins would be an excellent choice. Ruppert offered the job to Huggins, who accepted and signed a two-year contract. The hiring of Huggins drove a wedge between the two co-owners that culminated in Huston selling his shares of the team to Ruppert in 1922.

Ruppert and Huston purchased pitcher Carl Mays from the Boston Red Sox in 1918, in direct opposition of an order issued by Johnson. The matter was taken to court, where Ruppert and Huston prevailed over Johnson. The case led to the dissolution of the National Commission, which governed baseball, and helped lead to the creation of the Commissioner of Baseball. Ruppert eventually organized opposition to Johnson among other AL owners.

The Yankees purchased star pitcher-outfielder Babe Ruth from the Red Sox in 1919, which made the Yankees a profitable franchise. The Yankees began to outdraw the Giants, with whom they shared the Polo Grounds. In 1921 the Yankees won the AL pennant for the first time, but lost to the Giants in the World Series. As a result of the Yankees&#x27; increased popularity, Charles Stoneham, owner of the Giants and the Polo Grounds, raised the rent for the 1922 season. The Yankee owners responded by purchasing land in The Bronx, across the Harlem River from the Polo Grounds, from the estate of William Waldorf Astor for $675,000 ($ in current dollar terms), breaking ground on a new stadium in May 1922. That year, the Giants once again defeated the Yankees in the World Series. Yankee Stadium opened on April 18, 1923, the first ballpark with three tiers of seating for fans, and the first referred to as a &quot;stadium&quot;. Ruppert and Huston financed the project with $2.5 million of their own money ($ in current dollar terms).

In May 1922, Ruppert bought out Huston for $1.5 million ($ in current dollar terms), and he became the sole owner. The following season, the Yankees finally beat the Giants to win their first World Series title. The Yankees went on to dominate baseball throughout most of the 1920s and 1930s, winning three more pennants from 1926 through 1928, including the Murderers&#x27; Row team that won the 1927 World Series and repeated as champions the following year. They returned to the top with the 1932 World Series title, and then began their strongest period yet with the Bronx Bombers teams of the late 1930s, becoming the first team to win three consecutive World Series titles in 1936, 1937 and 1938. In 1937, the Yankees became the first team to win six World Series titles, and in 1938 they surpassed the Philadelphia Athletics to become the first team to win ten AL championships, with only the Giants winning more pennants in the 20th century.

In 1929, Ruppert added numbers to the Yankees&#x27; uniforms, which became a feature of every team. He said, &quot;Many fans do not attend games on a regular basis and cannot easily pick out the players they have come to see.&quot;

in 1931, Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis allowed for the creation of farm systems directly operated by major league teams. Ruppert bought the Newark Bears who played at Ruppert Stadium in Newark, New Jersey, and begin building the Yankees&#x27; farm system. Ruppert&#x27;s 24 years as owner of the Yankees saw him build the team from an also-ran to a baseball powerhouse. His own strength as a baseball executive – including his willingness to wheel and deal – was aided by the business skills of general manager Ed Barrow and the forceful field managing of Miller Huggins, until his sudden death at age 50 late in the 1929 season, and Joe McCarthy, beginning in 1931. By the time of Ruppert&#x27;s death, the team was well on its way to becoming the most successful in the history of Major League Baseball, and eventually in North American professional sports.

Ruppert and Ruth had public disagreements about Ruth&#x27;s contracts. Nevertheless, they were personal friends; according to Ruth, Ruppert called him &quot;Babe&quot; only once, and that was the night before he died. Usually, Ruppert called him &quot;Root&quot; (as &quot;Ruth&quot; sounded in his German-accented voice); he always called everyone, even close friends, by their last name. Ruth was one of the last persons to see Ruppert alive.

==Personal life==
In 1894, Ruppert purchased South Brother Island, located in the East River, and was the last person to live on the island, leaving in 1909 when his house burned down. He purchased Eagle&#x27;s Rest, an estate in Garrison, New York, on January 30, 1919.

==Death and legacy==
===Death===
Ruppert suffered from phlebitis in April 1938 and was confined to his Fifth Avenue apartment for most of the year. He was too sick to follow the Yankees to the 1938 World Series, what would be their seventh world title under his stewardship; he listened on the radio. In November 1938, he checked into Lenox Hill Hospital, where he died on January 13, 1939. He was survived by his brother George and his sister Amanda, and was interred in the family mausoleum at Kensico Cemetery, Valhalla, New York.

===Legacy===

Ruppert&#x27;s father, Jacob Sr., left behind an estate of $6,382,758 ($ in current dollar terms) when he died in 1915, which Ruppert increased to $120 million by the time of his death in 1939. This was managed by his heirs. His brother George, who served as the Yankees&#x27; vice president, declined to take over the team presidency, and instead recommended that general manager Ed Barrow be given control of the club. Under Barrow&#x27;s leadership, the Yankees won a fourth consecutive World Series in 1939, and captured three more AL titles and two World Series from 1941 to 1943 as the nation entered World War II. After mismanaging Ruppert&#x27;s brewery, the heirs sold the Yankees to Dan Topping, Del Webb and Larry MacPhail in 1945. The brewery sold its flagship beer, Knickerbocker beer, to Rheingold, and went out of business in 1965.

On April 16, 1940, the Yankees dedicated a plaque in Ruppert&#x27;s memory, to hang on the center field wall of Yankee Stadium, near the flagpole and the monument that had been dedicated to former manager Miller Huggins. The plaque called Ruppert &quot;Gentleman, American, sportsman, through whose vision and courage this imposing edifice, destined to become the home of champions, was erected and dedicated to the American game of baseball.&quot; The plaque now rests in Monument Park at New Yankee Stadium.

An apocryphal story says that Ruppert is responsible for the Yankees&#x27; famous pinstriped uniforms; according to this account, Ruppert chose pinstripes to make the often-portly Ruth appear less obese, but the uniform was in fact introduced in 1912.

A beer was named after Ruppert, as were Ruppert Stadium in Newark, New Jersey. Ruppert Park in Manhattan, is part of the Ruppert Yorkville Towers housing complex was built on the site the brewery in Yorkville, Manhattan.

==National Baseball Hall of Fame==
On December 3, 2012, Ruppert was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame by the new Pre-Integration Era Committee, which considers candidates (managers, umpires, executives, and players) every three years that have been identified by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA) appointed Historical Overview Committee from the era prior to 1947. He was inducted into the Hall on July 28, 2013. His induction speech was given by Anne Vernon, a fifth-generation descendant of Ruppert&#x27;s brother George.

<doc id="413922" wikidata="Q2000634" url="?curid=413922" title="North Downs">
<text>The North Downs are a ridge of chalk hills in south east England that stretch from Farnham in Surrey to the White Cliffs of Dover in Kent. Much of the North Downs comprises two Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs): the Surrey Hills and the Kent Downs. The North Downs Way National Trail runs along the North Downs from Farnham to Dover.

The highest point in the North Downs is Botley Hill, Surrey ( above sea level). The &quot;County Top&quot; of Kent is Betsom&#x27;s Hill ( above sea level), which is less than 1 km from Westerham Heights, Bromley, the highest point in Greater London at an elevation of .

==Etymology==
&#x27;Downs&#x27; is from Old English &quot;dun&quot;, meaning, amongst other things, &quot;hill&quot;. The word acquired the sense of &quot;elevated rolling grassland&quot; around the 14th century. The name contains &quot;North&quot; to distinguish them from a similar range of hills – the South Downs – which runs roughly parallel to them but some to the south.

==Geography==
The narrow spine of the Hog&#x27;s Back between Farnham and Guildford forms the western extremity of the North Downs, whilst the cliffs between Folkestone and Deal terminate the ridge in the east. The North Downs cuesta has a steep south-facing scarp slope and a more gentle north-facing dip slope. Its southern boundary is defined by the low-lying Vale of Holmesdale at the foot of the escarpment, in which the underlying stratum is primarily gault clay. The northern boundary is less apparent but occurs where the chalk submerges below the more recent Paleocene deposits.

The Downs are highest near the Kent–Surrey border, often reaching heights in excess of above sea level at the crest of the escarpment. The highest point is Botley Hill in Surrey at . The County top of Kent at Betsom&#x27;s Hill, with a height of , is nearby, and the highest point in Greater London, Westerham Heights, at , is on the northern side of the same hill. East of the Medway Valley the Downs become broader and flatter, extending as far as the Isle of Thanet.

The ridge of the North Downs is intersected by the valleys of a series of rivers: the Wey, Mole, Darent, Medway and Stour. These drain much of the Weald to the south. The western rivers are tributaries of the Thames; they have carved steep valleys through the chalk and provide natural corridor routes. In addition to existing rivers, the Downs are crossed by a number of wind gaps – prehistoric river valleys no longer occupied by rivers – including those at Farnham, Betchworth, Caterham, Lyminge and Hawkinge. Except for the river valleys and wind gaps, the crest of the escarpment is almost continuous along its length. The dip slope is dissected by many small dry valleys, and in the broad eastern part in Kent, by further river valleys such as that of the Little Stour.

Leith Hill (the highest point in Surrey) is sometimes incorrectly referred to as part of the North Downs, but it is located on the parallel Greensand Ridge and does not consist of chalk.

The Downland of the North Downs consists of distinct lithostratigraphic units (the types of strata, the names of which are always capitalised):

* Shallow layers of &quot;sand&quot; and &quot;gravel&quot; are associated with areas of heathland, including at Headley and Netley Heaths in Surrey. These deposits have their origin in the Quaternary and indicate the position of the sea shore during this period.
* &quot;Clay-with-Flints&quot;, a sandy clay with many flints is found on higher ground. The origins of this layer are uncertain, however the clay is thought to have been formed during several periods of glaciation and was produced by cryoturbation and decalcification of the chalk. This hypothesis is supported by the presence of flint, which is also found in the underlying strata.
* The &quot;Chalk Group&quot;, composed almost entirely of chalk, a soft, fine-grained limestone. These strata have their origins in the late Cretaceous (approximately 100 – 66 million years ago). For the entirety of this period, south east England was covered by a warm, shallow sea in which coccolithophores, single-celled algae with small calcite skeletons, thrived. As the phytoplankton died, their calcium-rich shells were deposited on the sea bed and, over time were compressed to form rock. The chalk of the North Downs is generally divided into three distinct stata: The &quot;Upper Chalk&quot;, which has many flints; the &quot;Middle Chalk&quot;, with fewer flints; and the &quot;Lower Chalk&quot; or &quot;Coombe Rock&quot;, greyish, with few flints. The chalk is most commonly exposed on slopes or as cliffs, where the overlying acidic strata have been quarried or washed away. The buried upper surface of the chalk beneath the acidic strata is often eroded into pipes, gulleys and pinnacles, sometimes visible in road cuttings and quarries.
* The &quot;Upper Greensand Formation&quot;, a whitish, limy sandstone, often used for building, for which it has been mined from beneath the chalk (for example from the Godstone Baby Mines). The Upper Greensand of the North Downs is a thin bed of one or two metres thickness, and it is rarely visible at the surface (it is much thicker elsewhere).

===Wealden uplift and erosion===

Following the Cretaceous, the sea covering the south of England began to retreat and the land was pushed higher. The Weald (the area covering modern day south Surrey, south Kent and north Sussex) was lifted by the same geological processes that created the Alps, resulting in an anticline which stretched across the English Channel to the Artois region of northern France. Initially an island, this dome-like structure was drained by the ancestors of the rivers which today cut through the North and South Downs. The dome was eroded away over the course of the Cenozoic, exposing the strata beneath and resulting in the escarpments of the Downs.

Chalk is a relatively soft rock that may be eroded or weathered in a number of different ways. It is porous, absorbing up to 20% of its dry weight in water, and is therefore highly susceptible to weathering by freeze-thaw action, which may occur over repeated annual or diurnal cycles. This frost weathering produces a mix of rubble and viscous mud, which may be washed downhill, further eroding the landscape (a process known as solifluction). Since chalk contains a very high percentage of calcium carbonate, it can be dissolved by both groundwater and rainwater.

Across much of the North Downs, the chalk dips below the London Clay at a relatively shallow angle (c. 18° near Dorking), however at the far west of the range, local faulting has produced a much steeper angle (up to 55°), resulting in the distinctive Hog&#x27;s Back between Farnham and Guildford.

==Ecology==
The North Downs support several important habitats including chalk grassland, scrub, woodland and chalk heath.

===Chalk grassland===
Chalk grassland is found on the steep south-facing scarp slopes and the more gently graded north-facing dip slopes, where woodland is absent. The alkaline soils are thin and nutrient poor, which prevents deeper-rooted lush grasses (with a high water demand) from dominating. Each square metre of chalk downland may support up to 40 different species. This semi-natural habitat is maintained through sheep, cattle and rabbit grazing which prevents scrub encroachment. Chalk grassland to the west of the Medway Valley is dominated by upright brome and fescue, whilst grassland to the east is dominated by tor-grass. Owing to the close proximity of the North Downs to the European continent, the warm climate and the south-facing escarpment, several plant species survive on the chalk grassland which are scarce or not found elsewhere in the British Isles.

The nationally rare late spider orchid is limited within the British Isles to chalk grassland between Folkestone and Wye. One of the two native British sites for the nationally rare monkey orchid is on the North Downs. The nationally scarce man orchid is not uncommon on chalk grassland on the Downs in Surrey and Kent. Other scarce plant species such as early gentian, dwarf milkwort and bedstraw broomrape also occur on chalk grassland in the North Downs.
Chalk grassland also supports a rich fauna, particularly insects. Notable butterfly species include Adonis blue and silver-spotted skipper, which may be found on warm, sheltered, south-facing slopes. The chalk downland above the Stour Valley is the only British site for the black-veined moth. Other notable moth species that occur on the North Downs include the fiery clearwing moth and the straw belle moth.

===Quarries and chalk cliffs===
On the summit of the cliffs between Deal and Folkestone the early spider orchid occurs in large numbers, as well as the rare oxtongue broomrape. Naturally exposed chalk is rare inland with the exception of the river cliffs formed by the River Mole on the west face of Box Hill and at Ham Bank in Norbury Park. However, quarry lakes within chalk pits provide habitats for great crested newt. The scarce musk orchid has colonised disused chalk pits near Hollingbourne in Kent.

===Woodland===
Woodland was far more extensive on the North Downs prior to human clearance 5000 to 4000 years ago. Fragments still remain particularly where the layer of clay-with-flints overlying the chalk has inhibited clearance. Where this is the case species such as pedunculate oak predominate, although much woodland has been replanted with conifer and sweet chestnut.
Calcareous woodland occurs on thin soils where chalk is close to the surface. These conditions are most often found on the escarpment of the North Downs and on valley slopes, but may also occur on the plateau of the dip slope. Calcareous woodland is typically dominated by beech, hornbeam, yew and ash. Box Hill has one of the largest areas of native box woodland in England. One notable species characteristic of calcareous woodland is the nationally scarce lady orchid, which is found in more than 100 sites on the Kent stretch of the North Downs, but is confined to just two sites elsewhere in the UK.

===Scrub===
Although its spread is often considered undesirable, scrub provides valuable habitat for a range of invertebrates, including the Roman snail, rufous grasshopper and the dark green fritillary.

===Chalk heath===
In Surrey, superficial deposits from the Quaternary are found overlying the chalk. These sands and gravels indicate the position of a former sea shore. Where these deposits occur, they are thin and the chalk also comes to the surface in the same areas (e.g. Headley Heath on the north east side of Box Hill), allowing acid-loving plants to thrive alongside those that prefer alkaline conditions, producing the rare chalk heath habitat.

==History==

Worked flints and human and animal remains dating from the Lower Paleolithic, about 400,000 years ago, were discovered at Barnfield Pit near Swanscombe; this provides the earliest evidence of human occupation in the North Downs. It is suggested that human activity at that time coincided with intermittent warm phases during the last glacial period and that continuous occupation of the Downs did not occur until warming after the glaciation. Flint axes have also been found on river terraces at Farnham, on Walton and Banstead Heaths and on the crest of the escarpment above Folkestone. There is considerable evidence of Mesolithic activity in the Surrey Downs through the discovery of &quot;pit-dwellings&quot; at Weston Woods near Albury and the quantity of discarded tools, microliths and other implements discovered.
In about 3000 BC the emergence of Neolithic culture saw the lifestyle of the Mesolithic hunter-gatherers shift to a more sedentary and communal lifestyle that relied upon the keeping of livestock and the growing of crops. There is substantial evidence of Neolithic activity within the North Downs, notably the long barrows concentrated in the Medway and Stour valleys. The Medway long barrows, which include Kit&#x27;s Coty House and Coldrum Stones, are constructed of sarsen stone, locally found on Blue Bell Hill and in the valleys of the dip slope, whilst the Stour Valley long barrows are constructed of earth.

==Agriculture and industry==

The landscape of the Downs has been greatly shaped by man. There has been deforestation of the Downs for centuries. The woodland that remains today is largely located where deforestation has been inhibited by steep slopes or by the layer of clay with flints, which is difficult to plough. Because of the many small farms that have survived on the Downs, a network of narrow lanes and minor roads has developed. This has resulted in a landscape similar to that found in Normandy known as &quot;bocage&quot;. The predominant type of farming on the Downs is arable farming; this increased greatly during the 20th century. Pastoral farming also occurs but to a lesser extent. Human settlements within the Downs have generally formed in sheltered valleys and at the foot of the scarp slope (known as spring line settlements). In recent years vineyards have been planted along the southern slopes of the Downs, in particular the Denbies Wine Estate, Dorking, which is the largest vineyard in the country, accounting for 10% of the country&#x27;s vines. The chalky soils are similar to those of the Champagne region.

There is plenty of evidence of chalk extraction on the Downs, particularly along the scarp slope. Oil has been drilled at the foot of the Downs in several locations in Surrey. The Kent Coalfield was established in the late 19th century after coal was found in 1890. Four successful collieries continued to be worked through much of the 20th century: Betteshanger, Snowdown, Tilmanstone and Chislet; Bettershanger was the last to close in 1989. The east to west ridge of the Downs has provided a natural transport route for centuries. Much of the historic Pilgrims&#x27; Way still survives at the foot of the scarp slope, and this has been joined much more recently by the M20 motorway. The scarp slope has also been used for fortification; many examples of this still exist, such as Thurnham Castle and on Castle Hill, Folkestone Castle Hill near Folkestone.

== Places of interest ==

Many beauty spots on the North Downs are owned by the National Trust, for instance Box Hill and Langdon Cliffs. Other areas of interest are Newland&#x27;s Corner, Wye Downs and the Hog&#x27;s Back. Much chalk grassland and ancient woodland on the Downs is open-access, and there are also many historic sites such as Kit&#x27;s Coty House (near Maidstone) and Dover Castle.

== Hills ==
The topography of the North Downs means there are relatively few summits with topographic prominence. Below is a list of summits on the North Downs which are more than 180 metres in height with 30 metres of topographic prominence (a commonly used threshold in Britain). The summits are arranged in order along the range, from west to east.

<text>Ascariasis is a disease caused by the parasitic roundworm &quot;Ascaris lumbricoides&quot;. Infections have no symptoms in more than 85% of cases, especially if the number of worms is small. Symptoms increase with the number of worms present and may include shortness of breath and fever at the beginning of the disease. These may be followed by symptoms of abdominal swelling, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Children are most commonly affected, and in this age group the infection may also cause poor weight gain, malnutrition, and learning problems.
Infection occurs by ingesting food or drink contaminated with &quot;Ascaris&quot; eggs from feces. The eggs hatch in the intestines, the larvae burrow through the gut wall, and migrate to the lungs via the blood. There they break into the alveoli and pass up the trachea, where they are coughed up and may be swallowed. The larvae then pass through the stomach a second time into the intestine, where they become adult worms. It is a type of soil-transmitted helminthiasis and part of a group of diseases called helminthiases.
Prevention is by improved sanitation, which includes improving access to toilets and proper disposal of feces. Handwashing with soap appears protective. In areas where more than 20% of the population is affected, treating everyone at regular intervals is recommended. Reoccurring infections are common. There is no vaccine. Treatments recommended by the World Health Organization are the medications albendazole, mebendazole, levamisole, or pyrantel pamoate. Other effective agents include tribendimidine and nitazoxanide.
About 0.8 to 1.2 billion people globally have ascariasis, with the most heavily affected populations being in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and Asia. This makes ascariasis the most common form of soil-transmitted helminthiasis. As of 2010 it caused about 2,700 deaths a year, down from 3,400 in 1990. Another type of &quot;Ascaris&quot; infects pigs. Ascariasis is classified as a neglected tropical disease.
== Signs and symptoms ==
In populations where worm infections are widespread, it is common to find that most people are infected by a small number of worms, while a small number of people are heavily infected. This is characteristic of many types of worm infections. Those people who are infected with only a small number of worms usually have no symptoms.

=== Migrating larvae ===
As larval stages travel through the body, they may cause visceral damage, peritonitis and inflammation, enlargement of the liver or spleen, and an inflammation of the lungs. Pulmonary manifestations take place during larval migration and may present as Loeffler&#x27;s syndrome, a transient respiratory illness associated with blood eosinophilia and pulmonary infiltrates with radiographic shadowing.

=== Intestinal blockage ===
The worms can occasionally cause intestinal blockage when large numbers get tangled into a bolus or they may migrate from the small intestine, which may require surgery. More than 796 &quot;A. lumbricoides&quot; worms weighing up to were recovered at autopsy from a two-year-old South African girl. The worms had caused torsion and gangrene of the ileum, which was interpreted as the cause of death.

The worms lack teeth. However, they can rarely cause bowel perforations by inducing volvulus and closed-loop obstruction.

=== Bowel obstruction ===
Bowel obstruction may occur in up to 0.2 per 1000 per year. A worm may block the ampulla of Vater, or go into the main pancreatic duct, resulting in acute pancreatitis with raised serum levels of amylase and lipase. Occasionally, a worm can travel through the biliary tree and even into the gallbladder, causing acute cholangitis or acute cholecystitis.

=== Allergies ===
Ascariasis may result in allergies to shrimp and dustmites due to the shared antigen, tropomyosin; this has not been confirmed in the laboratory.

=== Malnutrition ===
The worms in the intestine may cause malabsorption and anorexia, which contribute to malnutrition. The malabsorption may be due to a loss of brush border enzymes, erosion and flattening of the villi, and inflammation of the lamina propria.

=== Others ===
&quot;Ascaris&quot; have an aversion to some general anesthetics and may exit the body, sometimes through the mouth, when an infected individual is put under general anesthesia.

== Cause ==

=== Transmission ===
The source of infection is from objects contaminated with fecal matter containing eggs. Ingestion of infective eggs from soil contaminated with human feces or contaminated vegetables and water is the primary route of infection. Infectious eggs may occur on objects such as hands, money, and furniture. Transmission from human to human by direct contact is impossible.

Transmission comes through municipal recycled wastewater into crop fields. This is quite common in emerging industrial economies and poses serious risks for local crop sales and exports of contaminated vegetables. A 1986 outbreak of ascariasis in Italy was traced to irresponsible wastewater recycling used to grow Balkan vegetable exports.

The number of ova (eggs) in sewage or in crops that were irrigated with raw or partially treated sewage, is a measure of the degree of ascariasis incidence. For example:
* In a study published in 1992, municipal wastewater in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, detected over 100 eggs per litre of wastewater and in Czechoslovakia was as high as 240–1050 eggs per litre.
* In one field study in Marrakech, Morocco, where raw sewage is used to fertilize crop fields, &quot;Ascaris&quot; eggs were detected at the rate of 0.18 eggs/kg in potatoes, 0.27 eggs/kg in turnip, 4.63 eggs/kg in mint, 0.7 eggs/kg in carrots, and 1.64 eggs/kg in radish. A similar study in the same area showed that 73% of children working on these farms were infected with helminths, particularly &quot;Ascaris&quot;, probably as a result of exposure to the raw sewage.

=== Lifecycle ===
The first appearance of eggs in stools is 60–70 days. In larval ascariasis, symptoms occur 4–16 days after infection. The final symptoms are gastrointestinal discomfort, colic and vomiting, fever, and observation of live worms in stools. Some patients may have pulmonary symptoms or neurological disorders during the migration of the larvae. There are generally few or no symptoms. A bolus of worms may obstruct the intestine; migrating larvae may cause pneumonitis and eosinophilia. Adult worms have a lifespan of 1–2 years which means that individuals may be infected all their lives as worms die and new worms are acquired.

Eggs can survive potentially for 15 years and a single worm may produce 200,000 eggs a day. They maintain their position by swimming against the intestinal flow.

== Mechanism ==
&quot;Ascaris&quot; takes most of its nutrients from the partially digested host food in the intestine. There is some evidence that it can secrete enzyme inhibitors, presumably to protect itself from digestion by the hosts&#x27; enzymes. Children are often more severely affected.

== Diagnosis ==
Most diagnoses are made by identifying the appearance of the worm or eggs in feces. Due to the large quantity of eggs laid, diagnosis can generally be made using only one or two fecal smears.
The diagnosis is usually incidental when the host passes a worm in the stool or vomit. The eggs can be seen in a smear of fresh feces examined on a glass slide under a microscope and there are various techniques to concentrate them first or increase their visibility, such as the ether sedimentation method or the Kato technique. The eggs have a characteristic shape: they are oval with a thick, mamillated shell (covered with rounded mounds or lumps), measuring 35–50 micrometer in diameter and 40–70 in length. During pulmonary disease, larvae may be found in fluids aspirated from the lungs. White blood cell counts may demonstrate peripheral eosinophilia; this is common in many parasitic infections and is not specific to ascariasis. On X-ray, 15–35 cm long filling defects, sometimes with a whirled appearance (bolus of worms).

== Prevention ==
Prevention is by improved access to sanitation which includes the use of properly functioning and clean toilets by all community members as one important aspect. Handwashing with soap may be protective; however, there is no evidence it affects the severity of the disease. Eliminating the use of untreated human faeces as fertilizer is also important.

In areas where more than 20% of the population is affected treating everyone is recommended. This has a cost of about 2 to 3 cents per person per treatment. This is known as mass drug administration and is often carried out among school-age children. For this purpose, broad-spectrum benzimidazoles such as mebendazole and albendazole are the drugs of choice recommended by WHO.

== Treatment ==
=== Medications ===
Medications that are used to kill roundworms are called ascaricides. Those recommended by the World Health Organization for ascariasis are: albendazole, mebendazole, levamisole and pyrantel pamoate. Single-dose of albendazole, mebendazole, and ivermectin are effective against ascariasis. They are effective at removing parasites and eggs from the intestines. Other effective agents include tribendimidine and nitazoxanide. Pyrantel pamoate may induce intestinal obstruction in a heavy worm load. Albendazole is contraindicated during pregnancy and children under two years of age. Thiabendazole may cause migration of the worm into the esophagus, so it is usually combined with piperazine.

Piperazine is a flaccid paralyzing agent that blocks the response of &quot;Ascaris&quot; muscle to acetylcholine, which immobilizes the worm. It prevents migration when treatment is accomplished with weak drugs such as thiabendazole. If used by itself, it causes the worm to be passed out in the feces and may be used when worms have caused blockage of the intestine or the biliary duct.

Corticosteroids can treat some of the symptoms, such as inflammation.

==== Other medications ====
* Hexylresorcinol, effective in a single dose. During the 1940s this compound, as Crystoids brand pills, was the treatment of choice; patients were instructed not to chew the Crystoids to prevent burns to the mucous membranes. A saline cathartic would be administered several hours later.
* Santonin, more toxic than hexylresorcinol and often only partly effective.
* Oil of chenopodium, more toxic than hexylresorcinol

=== Surgery ===
In some cases with severe infestation, the worms may cause bowel obstruction, requiring emergency surgery. The bowel obstruction may be due to the number of worms in the bowel or twisting of the bowel. During the surgery the worms may be manually removed.

== Prognosis ==
It is rare for infections to be life-threatening.

== Epidemiology ==

=== Regions ===
Ascariasis is common in tropical regions as well as subtropical and regions that lack proper sanitation. It is rare to find traces of the infection in developed or urban regions.

=== Infection estimates ===
Roughly 0.8–1.3 billion individuals are infected with this intestinal worm, primarily in Africa and Asia. About 120 to 220 million of these cases are symptomatic.

=== Deaths ===
As of 2010, ascariasis caused about 2,700 directly attributable deaths, down from 3,400 in 1990. The indirectly attributable deaths due to the malnutrition link may be much higher.

== Research ==
Mouse and pig animal models are used to study &quot;Ascaris&quot; infection.

== Other animals ==
Ascariasis is more common in young animals than mature ones, with signs including unthriftiness, potbelly, rough hair coat, and slow growth.

In pigs, the infection is caused by &quot;Ascaris suum.&quot; It is characterized by poor weight gain, leading to financial losses for the farmer.

In horses and other equines, the equine roundworm is &quot;Parascaris equorum.&quot;
==Society and culture==
Kings of England Richard III and Henry VIII both had ascariasis.

<text>The yellow-bellied flycatcher (Empidonax flaviventris) is a small insect-eating bird of the tyrant flycatcher family.

== Description ==
Adults have greenish upperparts and yellowish underparts (especially on the throat), with a dusky wash on the chest. They have a white or yellow eye ring that lacks the teardrop projection of Pacific-slope (&quot;E. difficilis&quot;) or cordilleran (&quot;E. occidentalis&quot;) flycatchers, white or yellowish wing bars that contrast strongly against the black wings, a broad, flat bill, and a relatively short tail when compared to other members of the genus. The upper mandible of the bill is dark, while the lower mandible is orange-pink. DNA testing in 2014 confirmed a field mark, involving the extent of buffy edging on the secondaries, to reliably distinguish this species from the two so-called &quot;Western Flycatchers.&quot;

Measurements:

* Length: 
* Weight: 
* Wingspan: 

Yellow-bellied flycatchers wait on a perch low or in the middle of a tree and fly out to catch insects in flight, sometimes hovering over foliage. They sometimes eat berries or seeds.

The yellow-bellied flycatcher&#x27;s song can be transcribed as a rough, descending &quot;&quot;tse&quot;-berk&quot;, which can be similar to the more common least flycatcher&#x27;s snappier, more evenly pitched &quot;che-bek.&quot;

== Breeding ==
Their breeding habitat is wet northern woods, especially spruce bogs, across Canada and the northeastern United States. They make a cup nest in sphagnum moss on or near the ground.

== Migration ==
These birds migrate to southern Mexico and Central America.

<doc id="413936" wikidata="Q260960" url="?curid=413936" title="Alan Beith">
<text>Alan James Beith, Baron Beith, (born 20 April 1943) is a British Liberal Democrat politician who represented Berwick-upon-Tweed as its Member of Parliament (MP) from 1973 to 2015.

From 1992 to 2003 he was Deputy Leader of the Liberal Democrats. By 2015 he was the longest-serving member of his party&#x27;s House of Commons delegation, and was the last Liberal Democrat MP to have experience of Parliament in the 1970s.

Beith was elevated as a life peer in the 2015 Dissolution Honours List and took his title and a seat on the House of Lords Opposition benches on 23 November 2015.

== Early life ==

The son of John Beith, of Scottish extraction, he was born in 1943 at Poynton in Cheshire. He was educated at The King&#x27;s School, Macclesfield before going to Balliol College, Oxford, where he read Philosophy, Politics and Economics graduating in 1964. He then pursued postgraduate studies at Nuffield College, receiving a Bachelor of Letters (BLitt) degree.

In 1966, Beith began his career as a politics lecturer at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne. In 1969 he was elected as a Councillor on Hexham Rural District Council and, in 1970, he was also elected to Corbridge parish council. He contested Berwick-upon-Tweed as the Liberal candidate at the 1970 general election but was heavily defeated by the sitting Conservative MP Antony Lambton.

== Parliamentary career ==
Beith became a member of Tynedale District Council in 1973. Later that year, Antony Lambton resigned as an MP following a Fleet Street exposé. At the ensuing by-election on 8 November 1973, Beith was narrowly elected by 57 votes, becoming Berwick&#x27;s first Liberal MP since 1945.

Just three months after his by-election success, Beith was out canvassing his constituents again at the February 1974 general election, being returned to Parliament with an increased majority of 443. Later that same year and still less than a year after entering the House of Commons, Beith had to contest the constituency for a third time in less than a year at the October 1974 general election, retaining his seat with a slender majority of 73 votes. He held his seat with comfortable majorities in the eight further elections he stood in.

=== Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party ===

Beith was appointed to the BBC Advisory Council in 1974, and served as a member until 1984. On the election of David Steel as Liberal Leader in 1976, Beith became the Party&#x27;s Chief Whip in the Commons. After the 1983 general election, he was appointed Liberal Spokesman for Constitutional Affairs. He was elected as Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party in 1985, in both cases continuing his duties as a Commons Chief Whip.

After the 1987 general election, Beith concentrated his efforts as Liberal Spokesman for Treasury Affairs and stood down from being Liberal Chief Whip after eleven years in post. In 1988, the Liberal and Social Democratic parties merged, initially as the Social and Liberal Democrats.

=== Deputy Leader of the Liberal Democrats ===

Beith stood against Paddy Ashdown in the first leadership election in 1988, an election which Ashdown won by a large margin. Beith stayed on as Deputy Leader of the Liberal Democrats following the 1992 general election under Ashdown until 2003, and was sworn of the Privy Council in 1992. In 1994, he became the Liberal Democrat Home Affairs spokesperson and continued in post under Charles Kennedy&#x27;s leadership. After the 2001 general election he briefly became Lib Dem spokesperson for the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Department, but left the Lib Dem frontbench in 2002, though remaining its Deputy Leader until the following year.

After standing down from the Lib Dem frontbench he chaired the Commons Constitutional Affairs, and Justice Committees. Following Sir Menzies Campbell&#x27;s resignation as Leader of the Liberal Democrats on 15 October 2007, Beith was encouraged to stand as a prospective compromise candidate for the Lib Dem leadership. However, via his personal website, he announced his decision not to stand for election as party leader.

=== Later developments ===
On 19 May 2009, Beith was the first MP to declare his candidacy to succeed Speaker Michael Martin, who stood down from the position on 21 June 2009. Beith pledged he was &quot;willing to take on the task of leading reform&quot; were he elected as Commons Speaker. Conservative MP John Bercow won, becoming the 157th Speaker of the House Commons of the United Kingdom.
Beith was knighted in the 2008 Birthday Honours.

On 22 May 2009, Beith was reported by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; to have claimed £117,000 in second home allowances while his wife, Baroness Maddock, claimed £60,000 Lords expenses for sharing the same address.

Replying in writing on both their behalf to &quot;The Telegraph&quot; journalist&#x27;s exposé: &quot;It would be quite wrong for the taxpayer to pay twice for the same costs, so we have shared the costs, either by sharing the cost of rent, or by my wife using her allowance towards costs incurred (she normally claims only half the Lords&#x27; overnight allowance)&quot;, he argued in defence.

=== Coalition Government ===
At the May 2010 general election he was returned as MP for Berwick; however, his majority was reduced by a substantial swing to the Conservatives.

Beith served as Chairman of the Commons Justice and of the Liaison Select Committees until retiring in 2015.

He was one of only four Liberal Democrat MPs to vote against the third reading of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill. He was the only Liberal Democrat MP to oppose recognising Palestine as a state in the Commons vote on 13 October 2014.

Beith campaigned throughout his years in the House of Commons for the A1 road to be made a dual carriageway in Northumberland.

=== Elevation to the House of Lords ===
On 7 August 2013, Beith announced that he would retire as an MP at the next election, having at that point represented Berwick-upon-Tweed for 42 years. He was announced as a life peer in the 2015 Dissolution Honours and was created &quot;Baron Beith, of Berwick-upon-Tweed in the County of Northumberland&quot; on the afternoon of 19 October.

== Politics ==
Beith is more left-leaning and liberal in social issues, and more right-leaning and conservative economically.

=== Taxes ===
Beith has only voted for reducing VAT once, on 13 December 2008; from then on he voted for raising it. Beith supports higher taxes for alcohol. He always voted against a mansion tax. He also has voted for reducing capital gains tax and corporation tax. He has voted for raising the threshold for paying income tax.

=== Social ===
He voted against the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 in its third reading. Beith also voted for smoking bans and against a hunting ban. He supports lowering the voting age to 16. The Liberal Democrats generally support assisted dying; he has voted against it.

== Personal life ==
Beith was married in 1965 to Barbara Ward, and they had a son and a daughter. His first wife died in 1998, and he then married in 2001 Diana Maddock (&quot;née&quot; Derbyshire), formerly MP for Christchurch (1993–97).

Until her death on 26 June 2020, Lord Beith and Baroness Maddock divided their time between homes at Berwick-upon-Tweed, Northumberland, and London SW1; they were one of the few married couples both titled in their own right. Lord Beith serves as President of the Liberal Democrat Christian Forum and of the Historic Chapels Trust, a charity he helped to found and of which he was Chair of Trustees between 2001 and 2014. He is also President of Northumberland Hospital Radio and of the National Liberal Club.

He reportedly speaks French, Norwegian, Swedish and Welsh, and is a keen supporter of heritage matters.

<text>The list of people executed by the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]], with the exception of 1819–1849, is divided into periods of 10 years.
Since 1819, 1,343 people (all but nine of whom have been men) have been executed in Texas as of .

Between 1819 and 1923, 390 people were executed by hanging in the county where the trial took place. During the American Civil War, three Confederate deserters and a man convicted of attempted rape were executed by firing squad. The law was changed in 1923 requiring executions to be carried out in the electric chair at the Huntsville Unit in Huntsville, Texas. From 1924 to 1964, 361 people were executed in this way. After an 18-year gap following &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot;, executions were resumed following new capital-punishment laws passed by the State of Texas (and upheld in &quot;Gregg v. Georgia&quot;, which also included a companion case from Texas), among them changing the method of execution to lethal injection.

Since 1982 and as of , 593 people (all of whom were convicted of murder) have been executed by lethal injection at the Huntsville Unit. The number is over four times as many as Oklahoma (the state with the second-highest total of executions in the post-&quot;Gregg&quot; era and the only one with a higher execution rate) and over 37 times as many as California (the state with the largest number of death row inmates; California has not executed anyone since January 2006, and has a moratorium on capital punishment ).

Clarke then became a member of the Shadow Cabinet of John Smith as Shadow Scottish Secretary. Clarke was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome in 1992 but has since recovered. He then became the Shadow Minister for Overseas Development in 1993. Clarke left the Shadow Cabinet in 1994 and returned in 1995 to serve as Shadow Minister for the Disabled until 1997 under the leadership of Tony Blair.

Following the 1997 general election he joined the Privy Council and served as a Minister of State at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport with responsibility for Film and Tourism. He was reportedly dismissed from the role in a major government reshuffle whilst visiting the film set of &quot;Notting Hill&quot;.

Clarke was the Treasurer of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Overseas Development and authored the International Development (Reporting and Transparency) Act 2006, which ensures that the Secretary of State for International Development reports on what the Department for International Development spends in total on international aid and is categorised into what proportion is spent upon low-income countries, the effectiveness of current spending and the level of transparency of international aid. The Act is also used as a guide to establish the current progress upon United Nations Millennium Development Goals.

He served as the Treasurer of the All Party Group on Carers from 2005 until 2010 and was the Chair of the All-Party Group on Learning Disabilities.

Clarke served on the Administration Committee from 2008 until 2010. In the following parliament he was a member of the Standards and Privileges Committee and the Joint Committee reviewing the draft bill on Reform of the House of Lords. In 2014, Clarke received £15,000 in damages for defamation in the Daily Mail which incorrectly claimed that he was involved in the decision to reduce the amount of expenses that MP Maria Miller should repay, allegedly motivated by his own expenses claims.

In February 2013, Clarke voted against the second reading of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013. Subsequently, in May 2013, the MP voted against the bill&#x27;s third and final reading, opposing the legalisation of same-sex marriage within England and Wales.

==Honours==

Clarke was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1980 for services to local government. He was sworn of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom on 20 May 1997

In 2016, Clarke was awarded a Papal Knighthood and an audience with Pope Francis for his work on International Development and Disability Rights.

He was knighted in the 2021 New Year Honours for public and political service.

<text>David Maurice Curry (born 13 June 1944) is a British Conservative Party politician. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Skipton and Ripon from 1987 to 2010.

==Early life==
Curry, the son of teachers, was educated at the Ripon Grammar School where he was head boy in 1962, and then at Corpus Christi College, Oxford where he received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in modern history in 1966. He also attended the Harvard Kennedy School at Harvard University as a Kennedy Scholar. He began his career as a reporter on the Newcastle Journal in 1966. In 1970, he became the world trade editor at the &quot;Financial Times&quot; where he remained until he was elected to the European Parliament. In 1977, he founded the Paris Conservative Association.

==Political career==
Curry contested the safe Labour seat of Morpeth at the February 1974 general election, but was beaten by the sitting Labour MP George Grant by 13,034 votes. The two met again at the October 1974 general election, when Grant won by 14,687 votes.

Curry was elected a Member of the European Parliament in 1979 for Essex North East. He served until 1989.

Curry was elected to the House of Commons for the safe Conservative seat of Skipton and Ripon at the 1987 general election on the retirement of the sitting Conservative MP John Watson. Curry won the seat with a majority of 17,174 and held the seat safely until he retired from Parliament in 2010.

Following his election Curry became a member of the Agriculture Select committee until he was promoted to the government of Margaret Thatcher in 1989 as Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. He was promoted within the same department to Minister of State after the 1992 general election by John Major. Two year later he moved sideways to the Department for the Environment where he remained until the Major government fell at the 1997 general election. He became a Member of the Privy Council in 1996.

In opposition Curry became the Shadow Agriculture Secretary, but resigned from the Shadow Cabinet in December 1997 in protest at the policy of ruling out Britain joining the single European currency for the next ten years. In 1998, he became the chairman of the Agriculture Select Committee and, after the 2001 general election, its successor the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee until 2003 when he promoted again to the Shadow Cabinet by Michael Howard as Shadow Local and Devolved Government Secretary. He resigned again in 2004, this time citing &#x27;family reasons&#x27; and was replaced by Caroline Spelman. He was a member of the Public Accounts Select Committee from 2004.

On 5 February 2009, Curry announced that he would not stand at the 2010 election.

On 19 November 2009, Curry stood down from his position as chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on Standards and Privileges after claims by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; regarding his expenses and reportedly referred himself to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority for investigation.

In January 2013, Curry was appointed editor-in-chief of &quot;The Parliamentary Review&quot;.

<doc id="413949" wikidata="Q478395" url="?curid=413949" title="Peeping Tom (1960 film)">
<text>Peeping Tom is a 1960 British psychological horror-thriller film directed by Michael Powell, written by Leo Marks, and starring Carl Boehm, Moira Shearer, Anna Massey and Maxine Audley. The film revolves around a serial killer who murders women while using a portable film camera to record their dying expressions of terror, putting his footage together into a snuff film used for his own self-pleasure. Its title derives from the expression &quot;Peeping Tom&quot;, which describes a voyeur.

The film&#x27;s controversial subject matter and its extremely harsh reception by critics had a severely negative impact on Powell&#x27;s career as a director in the United Kingdom. However, it attracted a cult following, and in later years, it has been re-evaluated and is now widely considered a masterpiece, and a progenitor of the contemporary slasher film. The British Film Institute named it the 78th greatest British film of all time, and in 2017 a poll of 150 actors, directors, writers, producers and critics for &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine saw it ranked the 27th best British film ever.

The music score was written by Brian Easdale and performed by Australian pianist Gordon Watson.

==Plot==

In London, Mark Lewis picks up Dora, a prostitute, covertly filming her with a camera hidden under his coat. Shown from the point of view of the camera viewfinder, he follows her into her flat, murders her with a blade concealed in one leg of his tripod, and later watches the film in his darkroom. The following morning, posing as a reporter, he films the police removing Dora&#x27;s corpse from her home.

Lewis is a member of a film crew (a focus puller) who aspires to become a filmmaker himself. He also works part-time photographing soft-porn pin-up pictures of women, sold under the counter. He is a shy, reclusive young man who hardly socialises outside of his workplace. He lives in the house of his late father, renting most of it via an agent while posing as a tenant himself. Helen Stephens, a sweet-natured young woman who lives with her blind mother in the flat below his, befriends him out of curiosity after he is discovered spying on her 21st birthday party.

Mark reveals to Helen through home films taken by his father that, as a child, he was used as a guinea pig for his father&#x27;s studies on fear in children. Mark&#x27;s father would study his son&#x27;s reaction to various stimuli, such as large lizards he put on his bed, and would film the boy in all sorts of situations, even recording Mark&#x27;s reactions at his mother&#x27;s deathbed. (He married another woman suspiciously soon afterwards.) His studies enhanced his reputation as a renowned psychologist.

Mark arranges with Vivian, a stand-in at the studio, to make a film after the set is closed; he then kills her and stuffs her into a prop trunk. The body is discovered later during shooting by Pauline, a cast member who has already antagonised the fussy director by acting a faint badly, and then actually fainting from exhaustion at the many retakes. The police link the two murders and notice that each victim died with a look of utter terror on her face. They interview everyone on the set, including Mark, who always keeps his camera running, claiming that he is making a documentary.

Helen goes out to dinner with Mark, persuading him to leave his camera behind for once, and briefly kisses him once they return. Her mother finds his behavior peculiar, being aware, despite her blindness, that Mark often looks through Helen&#x27;s window. She is waiting inside Mark&#x27;s flat after his evening out with her daughter. Unable to wait until she leaves due to his compulsion, he begins screening his latest snuff film with her still in the room. She senses how emotionally disturbed he is and threatens to move, but Mark reassures her that he will never photograph or film Helen.

A psychiatrist is called to the set to counsel Pauline. He chats with Mark and is familiar with his father&#x27;s work. The psychiatrist relates the details of the conversation to the police, noting that Mark has &quot;his father&#x27;s eyes&quot;. Mark is tailed by the police to the newsagents, where he takes photographs of pin-up model Milly. Shortly afterwards, it emerges that Mark has killed Milly.

Helen, who is curious about Mark&#x27;s films, finally runs one of them. She becomes upset and then frightened when he catches her. Mark reveals that his father not only filmed his experiments on him, but recorded them and has wired the house, and he plays a recording of her with her boyfriend. Mark makes his films so that he can capture the fear of his victims. He has mounted a mirror on his camera so that he can film his victims&#x27; reactions as they see their own impending deaths. He points the tripod&#x27;s blade towards Helen&#x27;s throat and we see her reaction distorted in the mirror, but he cannot kill her.

The police approach and Mark hears their sirens. As he planned from the very beginning, he impales himself on the knife with the camera running, providing the finale for his documentary. Helen cries over Mark&#x27;s dead body as the police enter the room. As the scene fades, we hear a recording of his father calling him a good boy.

==Cast==
==Themes==
&quot;Peeping Tom&quot; has been praised for its psychological complexity, which incorporates the &quot;self-reflexive camera&quot; as a plot device, as well as the themes of child abuse, sadomasochism, and scopophilic fetishism. On the surface, the film is about the Freudian relationships between the protagonist and, respectively, his father, and his victims. However, several critics argue that the film is as much about the voyeurism of the audience as they watch the protagonist&#x27;s actions. Roger Ebert, in his 1999 review of the film for his &quot;Great Films&quot; series, states that &quot;the movies make us into voyeurs. We sit in the dark, watching other people&#x27;s lives. It is the bargain the cinema strikes with us, although most films are too well-behaved to mention it&quot;.

According to Paul Wells, the film deals with the anxieties of British culture in regarding sexual repression, patriarchal obsession, voyeuristic pleasure and perverse violence. The impossible task in the film is the quest to photograph fear itself.

In the opinion of Peter Keough, the death scenes of the film would provide a field day to Freudian psychoanalysis and deconstructionists. Cinema here is equated to sexual aggression and a death wish, the camera to the phallus, photography to violation, and film to ritualized voyeurism. The emphasis of the film lies on morbidity, not on eroticism. In a memorable sequence, an attractive, semi-nude female character turns to the camera and reveals a disfiguring facial scar. This Peeping Tom is aroused not by naked bodies, but naked fear. As Mark laments, whatever he photographs is lost to him. Mark is a loner whose only companion is his film camera. He is also the victim of his father&#x27;s studies in the phenomenon of fear in children, a human guinea pig subjected to sadistic experiments. His love interest Helen has her own fascination with a morbid gaze. She is a children&#x27;s writer whose book concerns a magic camera and what it photographs.

===Relationship with Hitchcock&#x27;s films===
The themes of voyeurism in &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; are also explored in several films by Alfred Hitchcock. In his book on Hitchcock&#x27;s 1958 film &quot;Vertigo&quot;, film historian Charles Barr points out that the film&#x27;s title sequence and several shots seem to have inspired moments in &quot;Peeping Tom&quot;.

Chris Rodley&#x27;s documentary &quot;A Very British Psycho&quot; (1997) draws comparisons between &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; and Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960); the latter film was given its New York premiere in June 1960, two months after &quot;Peeping Tom&quot;″s premiere in London. Both films feature as protagonists atypically mild-mannered serial killers who are obsessed with their parents. However, despite containing material similar to &quot;Peeping Tom&quot;, &quot;Psycho&quot; became a box-office success and only increased the popularity and fame of its director (although the film was widely criticised in the English press). One reason suggested in the documentary is that Hitchcock, seeing the negative press reaction to &quot;Peeping Tom&quot;, decided to release &quot;Psycho&quot; without a press screening.

In his early career, Powell worked as a stills photographer and in other positions on Hitchcock&#x27;s films, and the two were friends throughout their careers. A variant of &quot;Peeping Tom&quot;″s main conceit, &quot;The Blind Man&quot;, was one of Hitchcock&#x27;s unproduced films around this time. Here, a blind pianist receives the eyes of a murder victim, but their retinas retain the image of the murder.

According to Isabelle McNeill, the film fits well within the slasher film subgenre, with &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; being considered the first slasher film in history. She lists a number of elements which it shares with both &quot;Psycho&quot; and the genre in general:
* A recognisably human killer, who stands as the psychotic product of a sick family;
* The victim being a beautiful and sexually active woman;
* The location of the murder being not within a home, but within some other &quot;terrible place&quot;;
* The weapon being something other than a gun;
* The attack registered from the victim&#x27;s point of view and coming with shocking suddenness;
She finds that the film actually goes further than &quot;Psycho&quot; into slasher territory through introducing a series of female victims, and with Helen Stephens functioning as the bright and sympathetic final girl.

==Production==
===Writing===
Screenwriter Leo Marks based portions of the film on his experience growing up as the son of Benjamin Marks, who owned the Marks &amp; Co bookshop in London; elements of &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; is based on his observations of inner-city residents who frequented his father&#x27;s store. Dora, the prostitute who is murdered in the film&#x27;s opening scene, was based on a real-life prostitute who was a regular patron of the Marks &amp; Co book store. Additionally, Marks stated he was inspired to write a horror story and to become a codebreaker after reading &quot;The Gold-Bug&quot; by American writer Edgar Allan Poe. While writing the script, Marks believed the motivations behind Lewis&#x27; murder to be entirely sexual, though he would state in retrospect that he felt the psychological compulsion of the character was less sexual than it was unconscious. Prior to writing the screenplay for &quot;Peeping Tom&quot;, Marks, a polymath, had worked as cryptographer during World War II.

===Casting and filming===
Cohen originally wanted a star to play the lead role and suggested Dirk Bogarde, but the Rank Organisation, who had him under contract, refused to loan him out. Laurence Harvey was attached for a while but pulled out during pre-production and Powell ended up casting German-Austrian actor Karlheinz Böhm (billed as Carl Boehm). Böhm, who was a friend of Powell&#x27;s, noted that their prior acquaintance helped him psychoanalyze and &quot;go into very, very special details&quot; of the character. Böhm saw Lewis as a sympathetic character, whom he felt &quot;great pity&quot; for. In a 2008 interview, Böhm stated that he could identify with the character because he also stood for a long time in the shadow of his famous father, conductor Karl Böhm, and had a difficult relationship with him. Böhm also stated that he interpreted his character as being traumatized by growing up under the Nazi Regime.

Pamela Green, then a well-known glamour model in London, was cast in the role of Milly, one of Lewis&#x27;s victims, who appears nude onscreen in the moments leading up to her murder scene. Her appearance marked the first scene in British cinema to feature frontal nudity.

Filming took six weeks beginning in October 1959. The film was financed by Nat Cohen and Stuart Levy at Anglo-Amalgamated with other funds from the National Film Finance Corporation. According to &quot;Variety&quot;, Anglo invested $560,000, the most it had ever spent on any one film. &quot;Filmink&quot; argued &quot;Cohen would have hoped the association with Powell would turn out to be as happy as the one with Joseph Losey&quot;, a director who had made a number of movies for Cohen.

==Release==
&quot;Peeping Tom&quot; was first released in the United Kingdom by Anglo-Amalgamated, premiering in London on 7 April 1960. It is often considered part of a Sadean trilogy with &quot;Horrors of the Black Museum&quot; (1959) and &quot;Circus of Horrors&quot; (1960). The three films had different production companies but the same distributor. They are connected through their themes of voyeurism, disfigurement, and sadistic figures. Anglo-Amalgamated films were typically released in the United States by American International Pictures through a deal between the two companies. But AIP was not interested in releasing &quot;Peeping Tom&quot;, apparently skeptical of its ability to satisfy audiences.

In the United States, the film was released by importer and distributor Astor Pictures in 1962. It was released simultaneously to the markets for genre horror films, art films, and exploitation films. It failed to find an audience and was one of the least successful releases by Astor. The film received a B rating from the National Legion of Decency, signifying &quot;morally objectionable in part&quot; content. The organisation identified voyeurism and sadism as key elements of the film in its rating.

===Censorship===
When &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; was first released in Italy in 1960, the Committee for the Theatrical Review of the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities rated it as VM16: not suitable for children under 16. The reason for the age restriction, cited in the official documents, is: the storyline is shocking and several scenes are not suitable for minors. In order for the film to be screened publicly, the Committee imposed the removal of two scenes taking place in the photographer&#x27;s studio, in particular, those in which Milly is shown alone, fully dressed and half-undressed, in front of the mirror, in addition to two other scenes showing a woman lying on the bed excessively half-undressed. The film was banned in Finland until 1981.

===Home media===
&quot;Peeping Tom&quot; has received several DVD releases. In the United Kingdom, it was released by Studio Canal and Warner Bros., and later in a six-DVD box set which also includes the films &quot;I Know Where I&#x27;m Going!&quot; (1945) and &quot;A Canterbury Tale&quot; (1944). In 2007, it received a new DVD release from Optimum Releasing in the United Kingdom, followed by a 50th Anniversary Blu-ray release in 2010.

The film was released in the United States by The Criterion Collection on LaserDisc on 23 March 1994 and on DVD on 16 November 1999. A 4K restoration of the film was released on Blu-ray in the UK on 29 January 2024 by StudioCanal and in the US on 14 May 2024 by The Criterion Collection. It began streaming on Kanopy on 31 May 2024.

==Reception==
===Contemporaneous===
&quot;Peeping Tom&quot;″s depiction of violence and its lurid sexual content made it a controversial film on initial release and the critical backlash heaped on the film was a major factor in finishing Powell&#x27;s career as a director in the United Kingdom. Karlheinz Böhm later recalled that after the premiere nobody from the audience went to shake either his hand or Powell&#x27;s. A later assessment of the film published in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; noted that the film effectively &quot;killed&quot; Powell&#x27;s career. British reviews tended towards the hyperbolic in negativity, an example being a review published in &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; which likened Powell to the Marquis de Sade.

&quot;Kinematograph Weekly&quot; reported in April 1960 that &quot;Most of the national critics were not enamoured with the subject matter of &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; and while I would agree that it is not everybody&#x27;s cup of tea, it is a powerfully gripping, well-produced picture and I do not think there can be any doubt that it will do very well as an X certificate booking.&quot;

Derek Hill, reviewer of &quot;Tribune&quot; magazine suggested that &quot;the only really satisfactory way to dispose of &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; would be to shovel it up and flush it swiftly down the nearest sewer&quot;. Len Mosley, writing for the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, said that the film was more nauseating and depressing than the leper colonies of East Pakistan, the back streets of Bombay, and the gutters of Calcutta. Caroline Lejeune of &quot;The Observer&quot; wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s a long time since a film disgusted me as much as &quot;Peeping Tom&quot;&quot;, ultimately deeming it a &quot;beastly film&quot;.

Alexander Walker of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; called it &quot;a clever but corrupt and empty exercise in shock tactics... loathsome.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; dubbed it &quot;a horror film made all the nastier by its heavily assumed air of psychological studiousness.&quot; The &quot;Huddersfield Daily Examiner&quot; said the film &quot;gave me the nauseating impression of being made for perverts only.&quot; In Australia, Colin Bennett of &quot;The Age&quot; called it &quot;the most revolting film I have seen for many years.&quot;

Some of the adverse reviews were used in ads. &quot;Kinematograph Weekly&quot; reported in June 1960:
One section of the press has got hot under the collar because adverse quotes from reviews on &quot; Peeping Tom &quot; (Anglo Amalgamated—British) are being exploited at the Gala Royal, Edgware Road, where the thriller is making a second West End appearance. No one denies the critics&#x27; right to say what they think, but they can hardly expect renters and exhibitors meekly to take knocks. Retaliation has paid off and &quot; Peeping Tom &quot; is packing the Gala Royal. Naturally, the publicity will do the film a power of good when it returns to the ABC circuit.
Michael Powell claims these bad reviews panicked Nat Cohen. Alexander Walker, the film critic, claimed Cohen &quot;dumped&quot; the film out of a desire to get a knighthood. The historical accuracy of these allegations has been questioned as no evidence has been provided to back them up.
===Box office===
&quot;Kinematograph Weekly&quot; reported in June 1960 that the film &quot;got rough treatment from the long-haired boys and girls [critics] but it&#x27;s clicking [at the box office]. The titillating label tips the scales.&quot; However the film was not a box office success.

===Critical reappraisal===
&quot;Peeping Tom&quot; earned a cult following in the years after its initial release, and since the 1970s has received a critical reappraisal. Powell noted ruefully in his autobiography: &quot;I make a film that nobody wants to see and then, thirty years later, everybody has either seen it or wants to see it&quot;. An account of the film&#x27;s steady reappraisal can be found in &quot;Scorsese on Scorsese&quot;, edited by Ian Christie and David Thompson. Martin Scorsese mentions that he first heard of the film as a film student in the early 1960s, when &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; opened in only one cinema in Alphabet City, which, Scorsese notes, was a seedy district of New York. The film was released in a cut black-and-white print but immediately became a cult fascination among Scorsese&#x27;s generation. Scorsese states that the film, in this mutilated form, influenced Jim McBride&#x27;s &quot;David Holzman&#x27;s Diary&quot;. Scorsese himself first saw the film in 1970 through a friend who owned an uncut 35mm colour print. In 1978, Scorsese was approached by a New York distributor, Corinth Films, which asked for $5,000 for a wider re-release. Scorsese gladly complied with their request, which allowed the film to reach a wider audience than its initial cult following. Vincent Canby wrote of the film in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1979: 

Film theorist Laura Mulvey echoed a similar sentiment, writing: &quot;&quot;Peeping Tom&quot; is a film of many layers and masks; its first reviewers were unable even to see it at face value. Entrenched in the traditions of English realism, these early critics saw an immoral film set in real life whose ironic comment on the mechanics of film spectatorship and identification confused them as viewers. But &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; offers realistic cinematic images that relate to the cinema and nothing more. It creates a magic space for its fiction somewhere between the camera’s lens and the projector’s beam of light on the screen&quot;.

Before his death in 1990, Powell saw the reputation of &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; rise. Contemporarily, the film is considered a masterpiece and among the best horror films of all time. In 2004, &quot;Total Film&quot; magazine named &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; the 24th greatest British film of all time, and in 2005, the same magazine listed it as the 18th greatest horror film of all time. The film contains the 38th of Bravo Channel&#x27;s 100 Scariest Movie Moments. &quot;The Guardian&quot; named it the 10th best horror film of all time in 2010, and a 2017 review in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; of the best British films ever made, states, &quot;contemporary critics in 1960 may have overlooked that voyeurism was its central theme. But who is the voyeur?&quot;

Martin Scorsese, who has long been an admirer of Powell&#x27;s works, has stated that this film, along with Federico Fellini&#x27;s &quot;8½&quot; (1963), contains all that can be said about directing:

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 95% based on 64 reviews, with an average rating of 8.8/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Peeping Tom&quot; is a chilling, methodical look at the psychology of a killer, and a classic work of voyeuristic cinema.&quot;

==Cultural references==
* Mike Patton&#x27;s band Peeping Tom, and its 2006 self-titled album, are named in tribute to this film.
* During a reminiscence in David Foster Wallace&#x27;s novel &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; (1996), Dr. James O. Incandenza, the man who went on to make a film that literally kills its audience, refers to having &quot;still-posters from Powell&#x27;s &quot;Peeping Tom&quot;&quot; in his childhood bedroom.
* In &quot;Scream 4&quot; (2011), the killer Ghostface directly references &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; while quizzing a victim. In this entry and in &quot;Scream 2&quot; (1997), a killer under the Ghostface identity films their murders. Similarly, Ghostface killers in other entries commit their killing sprees with the intention that they would be recreated in film. 
* A dialog of the film has been sampled for the beginning of &quot;Railway Jam&quot; on the &quot;So Tough&quot; album (1993) by Saint Etienne.
* A campaign video for the 2014 spring/summer Alexander McQueen collection was based on the opening scene of the film. The video features Kate Moss in the role of the killer&#x27;s victim.
* Edgar Wright&#x27;s &quot;Last Night in Soho&quot; (2021) is heavily inspired, both thematically and in the use of film language, by the film.

<text>A dripstick is a thin hollow tube installed vertically in the bottoms of fuel tanks of many large aircraft, used to check fuel levels. To read a dripstick, it is withdrawn from the lower surface of the wing. When the top of the dripstick is withdrawn below the level of the fuel, fuel enters it and drips through a hole in the cap. Graduations on it indicate the level of fuel in the tank.

Newer aircraft use a floatstick.

<text>Terence Anthony Gordon Davis (5 January 1938 – 9 December 2024) was a British Labour Party politician and businessman. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Bromsgrove from 1971 to 1974, and for Birmingham Stechford and its successor seat, Birmingham Hodge Hill, from 1979 to 2004. He was then Secretary General of the Council of Europe from 2004 to 2009.

==Early life==
Davis was born in Stourbridge on 5 January 1938. He went to the King Edward VI Grammar School (now the King Edward VI College) in Stourbridge.

Davis was a graduate of University College London, where he gained an LLB degree in 1962, and University of Michigan&#x27;s Ross School of Business, where he gained an MBA degree in 1962. He was a company executive from 1962 to 1971 for Esso, Clarks shoes and Chrysler Parts. From 1974 to 1979, he was a manager in the motor industry, with Leyland Cars.

==Political career==
Davis joined the Labour Party in 1965. He was elected to Yeovil Rural District Council, representing the village ward of Long Load, in 1967, in what was the first-ever contested election for the ward.

At the 1970 general election, Davis stood unsuccessfully in the Conservative-held Bromsgrove constituency, finishing second of two candidates with 41.5% of the vote. The sitting MP, James Dance, died the following year, and Davis won the resulting by-election.

The Bromsgrove constituency was abolished in boundary changes for the February 1974 general election, and in the new Bromsgrove and Redditch constituency, Davis lost to the Conservative Hal Miller. He stood again at the October 1974 general election and lost again. At the 1979 election, his wife Anne contested the seat for Labour and lost by a much larger margin.

In 1977, Birmingham Stechford Labour MP, Roy Jenkins, was appointed President of the European Commission, and Davis was selected as the Labour candidate in the by-election. He lost by 1,949 votes to the Conservative Andrew MacKay, but at the 1979 general election, he won the seat with a majority of 1,649.

The Stechford constituency was abolished in boundary changes for the 1983 general election, and Davis was re-elected in the successor constituency of Birmingham Hodge Hill. He held that seat until his retirement from the House of Commons 21 years later.

In 2004 he was elected Secretary General of the Council of Europe, and announced his intention to stand down from the UK parliament by applying for the Stewardship of the Chiltern Hundreds. The resulting by-election was held on 15 July and won by Labour&#x27;s Liam Byrne. He left the Council of Europe on 31 August 2009. He was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 2010 New Year Honours.

Wikileaks &quot;cablegate&quot; revelations disclosed that the US, unhappy about his criticisms of the US&#x27;s rendition program, regarded him as an &quot;unpopular lame duck&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Davis married Anne Cooper in 1963. They had a son and daughter. Davis died on 9 December 2024, at the age of 86.

<doc id="413956" wikidata="Q259646" url="?curid=413956" title="David Amess">
<text>Sir David Anthony Andrew Amess ( ; 26 March 1952 – 15 October 2021) was a British politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Southend West from 1997 until his murder in 2021. He previously served as MP for Basildon from 1983 to 1997. A member of the Conservative Party, he was a Catholic with socially conservative political views, and was in favour of Britain leaving the European Union.

Born and raised in Essex, Amess studied economics and government at Bournemouth University and then had short careers as a primary school teacher, underwriter and recruitment consultant. He was elected a Conservative councillor for Redbridge in 1982 and MP for Basildon at the 1983 general election. His position was seen as a bellwether seat, exemplifying the enthusiasm of the &quot;Essex man&quot; for the government of Margaret Thatcher. He held the seat in the election of 1992, but moved to the safer seat of Southend West at the 1997 general election and served the constituency as MP until his death.

In government, his highest position was as parliamentary private secretary to Michael Portillo for twelve years. He was more prominent as a backbencher, serving on many select committees and sponsoring several pieces of legislation, including the and the . The causes for which he campaigned included animal welfare, awarding city status to Southend-on-Sea, the honouring of Raoul Wallenberg, and support for those suffering from endometriosis.

Amess was knighted in the 2015 New Year Honours for political and public service. On 15 October 2021, Amess was murdered at a constituency surgery in Leigh-on-Sea by Ali Harbi Ali. Southend was granted city status as a memorial to Amess in 2022.

== Early life and career ==
David Anthony Andrew Amess was born on 26 March 1952 in Plaistow, Essex (now part of Newham, London). From a working-class background, he was the son of James Amess, an electrician, and his wife Maud Martin, a dressmaker. Amess was raised Catholic, like his mother. Maud died on 12 October 2016 at the age of 104.

Amess attended St Anthony&#x27;s Junior and Infant School, then St Bonaventure&#x27;s Grammar School (now St Bonaventure&#x27;s Catholic School) on Boleyn Road in Forest Gate. He said later in life that his political interests stemmed from his time at St Bonaventure&#x27;s, where he stood for the Revolutionist Party, whose key demands were for minimum pocket money and the abolition of homework; by the time he became an adult, he was a Conservative. As a child he had a stammer, and speech therapy to correct this resulted in the loss of his natural Cockney accent. Amess went on to Bournemouth College of Technology (now Faculty of Science and Technology of Bournemouth University), where he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree (BSc Econ Hons 2.2) in economics and government. Amess taught disabled children at St John the Baptist Primary School in Bethnal Green for a year (1970–71), and then spent a short time as an underwriter (1974–76) before becoming a recruitment consultant.

== Political career ==
He unsuccessfully stood as the Conservative candidate for Newham North West in the 1977 Greater London Council election. He contested the safe Labour Party seat of Newham North West at the 1979 general election. The seat was retained by Labour&#x27;s MP Arthur Lewis. In 1982, Amess was elected as a Conservative councillor to the London Borough of Redbridge&#x27;s Mayfield ward, with his party forming the majority administration. He served as vice chairman of the Housing Committee from 1982 until 1985 and stood down for the 1986 local elections.

The incumbent Conservative MP for Basildon, Harvey Proctor, moved to Billericay in the 1983 general election; Amess was selected to replace him and was elected Member of Parliament for Basildon on 9 June 1983. He exemplified the new demographic of &quot;Essex man&quot; who supported Margaret Thatcher enthusiastically. &quot;Campaign&quot; described him as &quot;representative of new Essex man, working class, father electrician, right wing, keen hanger, noisily rambunctious, no subtlety&quot;.

Amess continued serving as an MP and a local councillor until 1986, when he stood down from Redbridge Borough Council to concentrate on his Westminster seat. He held his Basildon seat narrowly at the 1987 general election, partly by developing a significant personal following. After the election, Amess was appointed a parliamentary private secretary to Michael Portillo, a position he held for ten years throughout Portillo&#x27;s ministerial career. Amess held his seat again at the 1992 general election, which was the first sign that the Conservatives would unexpectedly win that election; the Basildon constituency was viewed as the make-or-break milestone.

Prior to the 1997 general election, there was a boundary review which divided the Basildon seat into two parts, which were added into two neighbouring seats. At the time, Amess remarked that the Boundary Commission &quot;had raped the town of Basildon&quot; by adding an extra seat there. Given his small majority, the new Basildon constituency was almost certainly going to be gained by Labour. Amess thus decided to seek re-election elsewhere. In June 1995, Amess was selected for Southend West after the retirement of former Cabinet minister Paul Channon. He was consequently returned to Westminster again in the 1997 general election. Angela Evans Smith won the newly-drawn Basildon seat for Labour in 1997 by over 13,000 votes.

=== Southend city status ===
Amess was known for being at the centre of a long-running campaign to make Southend-on-Sea, the main town of his constituency, a city. On 18 October 2021, it was announced that Queen Elizabeth II had agreed to grant Southend city status in his honour. On 1 March 2022, Charles, Prince of Wales, presented the letters patent on behalf of the Queen in the council chamber at Southend Civic Centre, officially granting the town city status.

=== Involvement in legislation ===
Amess sponsored many bills in Parliament, including the Protection against Cruel Tethering Act 1988, and the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act 2000.

In 2014, he helped to pass the Security Printing (Specialist) Materials Bill. This bill ended a loophole which allowed companies who supplied specialist printing equipment to counterfeiters to evade prosecution.

In 2016, he helped to pass the Driving Instructors (Registration) Bill. This statute streamlined the process whereby instructors whose registration has lapsed can apply to return to the register. It also allowed instructors who wish to leave the register for personal reasons to do so without being penalised. Driving school owners and motoring organisations supported the bill.

==== Protection against Cruel Tethering Act 1988 ====
The Protection against Cruel Tethering Act came about as a result of Amess&#x27;s long-standing concern for animal welfare, supported by the National Farmers&#x27; Union. Amess stated in the House of Commons that the Ten Minute Rule bill was &quot;inspired by the Essex Horse and Pony Protection Society&quot;. The bill stated:In section 1 of the Protection of Animals Act 1911 there shall be added in subsection (1) the following words after paragraph (e) &quot;or (f) shall tether any horse, ass or mule under such conditions or in such manner as to cause that animal unnecessary suffering …

==== Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act 2000 ====

Amess&#x27;s most publicised legislative success came in 2000 with the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act. According to a speech in the House of Commons made by Amess, the Act came to fruition after he was drawn out of the Private Members Ballot. He met with Martyn Williams, a campaigner from Friends of the Earth, who convinced him of the need for the Act following on from the death of a constituent in a cold house.

The Act required the Secretary of State to &quot;publish and implement a strategy for reducing fuel poverty&quot;.

This Act was widely credited with a significant change in both attitude and policy towards fuel poverty within the UK. The scale of fuel poverty in England fell from 5.1 million households to 1.2 million households between 1996 and 2004, indicating the impact of the Act.

=== Parliamentary committees ===
==== Health Select Committee ====
Amess served on the Health Select Committee from 1998 until 2007. Due to his role on the Health Select Committee, he became Chair of the Conservative Party Backbench Committee for Health in 1999. He campaigned on various health issues since. While a member of the Committee, Amess played a prominent role in holding an inquiry into the state of obesity in the UK, leading to the publication of a report in 2004. The report found that two-thirds of the population of England are overweight or obese and went on to discuss the causes of obesity, as well as making various recommendations to combat the problem. He maintained an interest in the issue, tabling a series of Parliamentary Questions in July 2013.

==== Panel of Chairs ====
Amess was also a member of the Panel of Chairs, which comprises the chairman and two deputy chairmen of Ways and Means, as well as ten members nominated at the start of each session by the Speaker of the House of Commons. Amess was last appointed on 26 May 2010, but had been on the Panel since 2001. As a member of the Panel, Amess was responsible for chairing public bill committees, chairing Westminster Hall debates, and at times, for chairing committees of the whole House.

==== Backbench Business Committee ====
Amess was elected onto the newly formed Backbench Business Committee in 2010; he stood down in 2015.

==== Administration Committee ====
Amess became a member of the Administration Committee in 2015. This committee is responsible for overseeing the running of the Parliamentary Estate and its services. He stepped down from the committee following the 2019 general election.

=== Raoul Wallenberg ===
Amess campaigned for many years to have a statue erected in honour of Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat who saved tens of thousands of Jews in Nazi-occupied Hungary, an endeavour for which Wallenberg eventually lost his life. Amess began asking parliamentary questions in the late 1980s regarding Wallenberg, campaigning for him to be awarded honorary British nationality. Amess had previously attempted to push through a Raoul Wallenberg (Memorial) Bill in the 1989–90 session. He held an adjournment debate in Wallenberg&#x27;s honour in 1996. The resultant memorial created by sculptor Philip Jackson was installed in London, at Great Cumberland Place, outside the Western Marble Arch Synagogue and unveiled in 1997.

=== All-party parliamentary group on endometriosis ===
In March 2018, Amess launched an all-party parliamentary group on endometriosis to raise awareness of the condition and to investigate how those who have endometriosis can get the support that they need. Amess chaired the group, with Emma Hardy, Jackie Doyle-Price and Hannah Bardell as vice-chairs.

=== Industry and Parliament Trust ===
Amess became a Fellow of the Industry and Parliament Trust in 1994. Amess completed an IPT Post-Graduate Fellowship I in 2012, specialising in the Cultural and Creative Industries at BRIT School, ITN and the Royal Opera House. Amess became chairman of the board of trustees in 2014 and stood down at the end of his term in 2017.

=== Comments about Weinstein scandal ===
In October 2017, following the Harvey Weinstein sexual misconduct allegations, a statement was issued in the name of Amess which described the allegations against Weinstein as &quot;dubious to say the least&quot; and quoted Amess as having said that the &quot;sudden flurry of alleged inappropriate advances beggars belief&quot;. Amess later retracted the statement and apologised &quot;for any upset&quot;, saying that his staff had issued the statement without his authorisation.

== Media and publications ==

=== Publications ===
Amess wrote a pamphlet about his 1992 re-election to the Basildon constituency, &quot;Basildon—Against all Odds&quot; (2012). It was launched in the House of Commons at an event to mark the 20th anniversary of the election and was attended by Prime Minister David Cameron and Conservative Party activists.

Amess compiled a pamphlet titled &quot;Party of Opportunity&quot; with the Renewal Group, containing thirteen short biographical accounts of Conservative MPs who identify as working class or from a working-class background. The pamphlet, which was launched in the House of Commons in April 2014, included contributions from four government ministers, including Sajid Javid, Mark Francois, Patrick McLoughlin, and Mike Penning. The second edition of &quot;Party of Opportunity&quot; was launched in January 2015, sponsored by the Association of Conservative Clubs and included contributions from 29 Conservative MPs.

&quot;Ayes &amp; Ears: A Survivor&#x27;s Guide to Westminster&quot; was published by Luath Press in December 2020. The book includes sketches of colleagues, memorable speeches, scandals, and descriptions of major events in Parliament from an insider&#x27;s viewpoint. In February 2021, it was announced that the book had been shortlisted for the Parliamentary Book Awards in the Memoir/Biography category.

=== &quot;Brass Eye&quot; ===
Amess appeared in the February 1997 &quot;Drugs&quot; episode of the spoof current affairs television programme &quot;Brass Eye&quot;, and was fooled into filming an elaborate warning against the dangers of a fictional Eastern European drug called &quot;cake&quot;. Amess later asked a question about &quot;cake&quot; in Parliament, alongside real substances khat and GHB. In response, the Home Office minister incorrectly replied that &quot;cake&quot; was a name &quot;we understand refers to 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-benzylamphetamine&quot;, a real drug. In 2001, when &quot;Brass Eye&quot; was repeated and released on DVD, a disclaimer was added to the &quot;Drugs&quot; episode at Amess&#x27;s request reiterating his disapproval of recreational drug use.

== Political views ==

Amess normally adhered to Conservative party policy when voting in the Commons. He voted for the 2003 invasion of Iraq but was afterwards critical of the Labour government&#x27;s failure to find the weapons of mass destruction with which they justified the action at the time. On foreign policy, he was also a leading member of Conservative Friends of Israel (CFI). He was one of the few Conservative MPs to support the campaign to impeach Tony Blair.

Amess was one of 30 Conservatives who voted against military action in Syria in August 2013. He later commented that he felt the way he and his colleagues voted &quot;made a difference&quot; and if he had previously voted against the war in Iraq &quot;things might be different&quot; there as well. Amess supported the reintroduction of capital punishment. He was a critic of the government of Iran, and advocated for the National Council of Resistance of Iran; he publicly endorsed Maryam Rajavi&#x27;s 10-point manifesto. Amess was supportive of refugees and asylum seekers.

Amess opposed abortion. In June 2005, Amess supported the Prohibition of Abortion (England and Wales) Bill introduced by Laurence Robertson that sought to almost entirely ban abortion. After entering the House of Commons, Amess generally opposed bills furthering LGBT rights, including equal age of consent and same-sex marriage.

Amess campaigned for improvements in animal welfare and husbandry. He consistently voted to ban foxhunting and hare coursing. He was a patron of the Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation. Amess supported many campaigns, including banning cages for game birds, animal testing, puppy farming and smuggling, and ending the transport of live animals for export.

In September 2011, Amess accused the BBC of being biased regarding its reporting of events in Israel, which he said was covered in a &quot;highly disproportionate manner&quot;, showing the state in a &quot;poor light&quot;.

Amess was a Eurosceptic and came out in support of Brexit prior to the EU referendum, in which he said it was &quot;dangerous&quot; and a &quot;huge mistake&quot; to vote &quot;remain&quot;. He described the loss of parliamentary sovereignty and supremacy of EU law as the main negatives of UK–EU relations. Amess criticised then United States president Barack Obama&#x27;s intervention in the EU referendum campaign when he met with David Cameron, stating that he had &quot;absolutely no right whatsoever getting involved&quot;.

== Awards ==
Amess was knighted in the 2015 New Year Honours for political and public service.

At the Dods Charity Champion Awards 2011, Amess won the Animal Welfare and Environment Champion award, in which he was recognised formally for his leading role in and commitment to animal welfare, and was presented with the award by John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons, in the State Rooms of the Speaker&#x27;s House. The award is given to the parliamentarian who has done the most to tackle issues concerning the welfare of animals and the natural environment.

Amess received the &quot;Outstanding Achievement Award&quot; at the Charity Champion Parliamentary reception hosted by Dods in 2012 in recognition of his lifetime commitment to charitable work.

He was nominated for the Policy Driver for Animal Rights Protection award at the Grassroot Diplomat Awards 2014 for his longstanding dedication to animal rights.

== Personal life ==
He and his wife Julia Arnold had one son and four daughters. Arnold was a part-time caseworker for her husband. Their eldest daughter is actress Katie Amess. Amess was a lifelong supporter of Premier League team West Ham United and attended their final game at the Boleyn Ground in May 2016.

As an animal lover, his family had several pets. In 2016, these included a rescue dog; a pug called Lily. Lily was succeeded by a French Bulldog called Vivienne who, shortly after Amess&#x27;s murder in 2021, won the Westminster Dog of the Year Show.

Amess was the president of the Music Man Project, a local charity that provides musical opportunities to people with learning disabilities. He appeared with the group in performances at the Royal Albert Hall and the London Palladium.

Amess was a supporter of the British Monarchist Society.

== Murder ==
On 15 October 2021, Amess was fatally stabbed at his constituency surgery at Belfairs Methodist Church Hall in Leigh-on-Sea. Amess&#x27;s murder was later declared a &quot;terrorist incident&quot; by the Metropolitan Police. The investigation, led by Scotland Yard&#x27;s Counter Terrorism Command, explored &quot;a potential motivation linked to Islamist extremism&quot;. The killer, Ali Harbi Ali, a British citizen of Somali descent, was arrested at the scene, convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment with a whole life order. A post-mortem examination determined Amess died from multiple stab wounds to the chest.

=== Funeral ===
A procession and memorial service took place in Southend on 22 November. The private service, attended by family, was held at St Mary&#x27;s Church, the Church of England parish church in Prittlewell. The Reverend Paul Mackay and Monsignor Kevin William Hale led the service. A family statement was read by the former Conservative MP Ann Widdecombe. Afterwards, his casket processed through the streets in a horse-drawn hearse. The next day a funeral service was held at Westminster Cathedral. Prime Minister Boris Johnson joined former prime ministers, the Speaker of the House Lindsay Hoyle and the Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer at the service. A message from Pope Francis was delivered by Archbishop Claudio Gugerotti, the Apostolic Nuncio to Great Britain.

== Legacy ==

On 1 March 2022, Southend was granted city status by Queen Elizabeth; the city was visited by Prince Charles that day as a tribute to Amess. In October, politicians paid tribute to Amess and a tree was planted in his memory in Southend.

A shield of arms bearing the motto &quot;His Light Remains&quot; was posthumously granted to him, unveiled in the chamber of the House of Commons by his widow in October 2023. In December, a fund was launched in his memory.

A statue of Amess, by sculptor Andrew Lilley, began in January 2023. Amess&#x27;s widow was moved upon seeing its completion in October, stating, &quot;...I felt I could reach out and touch him.&quot; The statue was unveiled near the Chalkwell Lifeguards&#x27; base in Southend, on 11 April 2024.

Due to Amess&#x27;s Catholic faith, there was a minor campaign in 2022 for him to be canonised as a martyr by the Catholic Church.

<text>The Martian Manhunter (J&#x27;onn J&#x27;onzz, alias: John Jones) is a superhero in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by writer Joseph Samachson and artist Joe Certa, the character first appeared in the story &quot;The Manhunter from Mars&quot; in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #225 (November 1955). Martian Manhunter is one of the seven original members of the Justice League of America and one of the most powerful beings in the DC Universe.

He has also been featured in other DC Comics products, such as video games, television series, animated films, and merchandise like action figures. In live action, the character first appeared in the television pilot &quot;Justice League of America&quot;, played by David Ogden Stiers. He also appeared in the series &quot;Smallville&quot;, played by Phil Morris, and in the Arrowverse series &quot;Supergirl,&quot; played by David Harewood, he was also on other Arrowverse shows. Harry Lennix played the character in the DC Extended Universe, under the guise of General Calvin Swanwick, in the films &quot;Man of Steel&quot; (2013) and &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot; (2016), and appeared in his Martian form in &quot;Zack Snyder&#x27;s Justice League&quot; (2021).

==Publication history==

===Silver Age (1950s–1960s)===
Martian Manhunter aka John (J&#x27;onn J&#x27;onzz) Jones debuted in the back-up story &quot;The Strange Experiment of Dr. Erdel&quot; in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #225 (November 1955), written by Joseph Samachson and illustrated by Joe Certa. The character is a green-skinned humanoid from Mars, who is pulled to Earth by an experimental teleportation beam constructed by Dr. Saul Erdel. The Martian tells Erdel where he is from, and Erdel tells him that to send him back will require the teleportation beam&#x27;s robot brain to be recalibrated, and that this may take years. J&#x27;onzz changes into the shape of a human to blend in until he can return to Mars. The shock of seeing this kills Dr. Erdel and leaves J&#x27;onzz with no way of returning home. The character decides to fight crime while waiting for Martian technology to advance to a stage that will enable his rescue. To that end, he adopts the identity of &quot;John Jones&quot;, a detective in the fictional Middletown, USA.

During this period, the character and his backstory differ in some minor and some significant ways from modern treatments. Firstly, as with his counterpart, the Silver Age Superman, J&#x27;onzz&#x27;s power range is poorly defined, and his powers expand over time as the plot demands. The addition of precognitive abilities (&quot;Detective Comics&quot; #226) is quickly followed by telepathy and flight, &quot;atomic vision&quot;, super-hearing, and many other powers. In addition, his customary weakness to fire is only manifested when he is in his native Martian form.

A more significant difference is that in this version of him, there is no suggestion that Mars is a dead planet or that the character is the last of his kind. Many of the tales of the time feature either Martian technology or the appearance of other Martian characters such as his younger brother T&#x27;omm J&#x27;onzz. &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #236 (October 1956), for example, features the character making contact with the planet Mars and his parents.

J&#x27;onzz eventually reveals his existence to the world, after which he operates openly as a superhero and becomes a charter member of the Justice League. During the character&#x27;s initial few years as a member of the Justice League, he is often used as a substitute for Superman in stories (just as Green Arrow was for Batman) as DC Comics were worried about using their flagship characters too often in Justice League stories, fearing overexposure. The Martian and the archer inaugurated the team-up format of &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot;. J&#x27;onzz appears there one other time, working with the Flash. In some stories he is shown travelling through space at near-light speed or to other planets.

The detective John Jones is ostensibly killed in action by the Idol Head of Diabolu, an artifact which generates supernatural monsters. J&#x27;onzz abandons the civilian identity as he decides fighting this new menace will take a great deal of his time. At this point his feature moves to &quot;The House of Mystery&quot;, where J&#x27;onzz spends the next few years in battle against the Idol Head. Shortly after its defeat, he takes the persona of Marco Xavier to infiltrate the international crime cartel VULTURE, which he defeats in the final installment of his original series.

As Superman was allowed by DC to become a fully active member of the Justice League, J&#x27;onzz&#x27;s appearances there dwindled. He last participated in a mission in his original tenure in #61 (March 1968), shortly before his solo series was discontinued (&quot;The House of Mystery&quot; #173, May–June 1968). In #71, his people finally came to Earth for him and he left with them to found and become leader of New Mars. Over the next 15 years, J&#x27;onzz appeared sporadically in various DC titles.

===Bronze Age (1970s–mid-1980s)===
In 1972, Superman was teleported to New Mars. J&#x27;onzz briefly returned to Earth via spaceship in 1975. J&#x27;onzz made another trip to Earth shortly thereafter, leading to Superman and Batman fighting alongside him on New Mars. Three years later, he was discovered playing cosmic-level chess with Despero, using JLA-ers as the pieces. The Martian again encountered Superman in outer space. He permanently resurfaced in the DC Universe in 1984. Shortly thereafter, the League had several members resign (among many other changes), leaving an opening for the Manhunter. While staying on Earth, he decided to revive his John Jones identity, this time as a private detective, but had to explain his 20-year &quot;disappearance&quot;.

===Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; (mid-1980s–mid-1990s)===
In early 1987, DC revamped its struggling &quot;Justice League of America&quot; series by re-launching the title as &quot;Justice League&quot;. This new series, written by Keith Giffen and J.M. DeMatteis with art by Kevin Maguire (and later Adam Hughes), added quirky humor to the team&#x27;s stories. J&#x27;onzz is present from the first issue and within the stories is used as a for other characters in comical situations. The series also added a number of elements to his back story that have remained to the present (such as J&#x27;onzz&#x27;s obsession with Chocos cookies, due to Shazam&#x27;s influence).

The 1988 four-issue miniseries &quot;Martian Manhunter&quot; by J.M. DeMatteis and Mark Badger further redefined the character and changed a number of important aspects of both his character and his origin story. It is revealed that Dr. Erdel did not die and that the character&#x27;s humanoid appearance was due to physiological trauma and attempts to block out the death of his race, his familiar appearance a &quot;compromise&quot; between his true form and a human appearance based upon Erdel&#x27;s mental concept of what a Martian should look like. Later series use retroactive continuity (retcon) to establish that his real form is private and that, even on Mars, his &quot;public&quot; appearance was the familiar version. The native name for Mars is said to be &quot;Ma&#x27;aleca&#x27;andra&quot; in his native language (a nod to &quot;Malacandra&quot;, the name used by the inhabitants of Mars in C. S. Lewis&#x27; novel &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot;). The series also adds to canon the idea that J&#x27;onzz was not only displaced in space but in time and the Martian race, including J&#x27;onzz&#x27;s wife and daughter, has been dead for thousands of years.

The 1990s saw the character continue to serve in many different versions of the Justice League of America. In addition to serving in the League under his own identity, he also joins (under duress) disguised as &quot;Bloodwynd,&quot; a mysterious and powerful necromancer. J&#x27;onzz assumed the physical form, stand-offish mannerisms and magical powers of Bloodwynd, while Bloodwynd himself was transported and trapped inside of his &quot;blood gem&quot;. It was during this time the JLA engaged Doomsday in &quot;The Death of Superman&quot; series. After being hurled by Doomsday into a burning building, Blue Beetle discovers the merged identity of the two heroes. Soon after, it is revealed that J&#x27;onzz had accidentally bonded with Bloodwynd prior to his joining the League. The two are eventually separated and both continue their associations with the League.

The 1992 miniseries &quot;American Secrets&quot; is set in the character&#x27;s past, exploring a previously unknown adventure against the backdrop of a changing America during the 1950s. Written by Gerard Jones and with art by Eduardo Barreto, the series finds the Manhunter drawn into a murder mystery that rapidly escalates into paranoia and alien invasion.

===Post-&quot;Zero Hour&quot; (mid-1990s–mid-2000s)===
In 1997, J&#x27;onn J&#x27;onzz became a founding member of Grant Morrison and Howard Porter&#x27;s new &quot;JLA&quot; where the team fought a group of White Martians, the Hyperclan.

&quot;Martian Manhunter&quot; began as an ongoing series in 1998, written by John Ostrander and illustrated by Tom Mandrake (with fill-in art provided by Bryan Hitch among others). The series lasted 38 issues before being canceled due to low sales. Ostrander established that Martian Manhunter is the most recognized hero in the Southern Hemisphere and that he maintains a number of different secret identities, many of them outside the United States, though his primary and first secret identity is still John Jones. However, after Cameron Chase reveals some of his identities to the public, he begins to use fewer secret identities. In another incident, part of his psyche splits off from his main personality, taking on the identity of John Jones, and dies, leading J&#x27;onn to decide to focus on his original human identity and retire the others to honor of the part of him that died.

The series establishes that J&#x27;onzz has a disturbed brother, Ma&#x27;alefa&#x27;ak, who uses his shapeshifting abilities to pose as J&#x27;onzz, capturing and torturing Jemm, Son of Saturn, and terraforming part of Earth to resemble Mars (areoforming). This is all part of a grand plan designed to convince the rest of the Justice League that J&#x27;onzz has turned into a sociopath. However, J&#x27;onzz is able to clear his name and defeat Ma&#x27;alefa&#x27;ak despite having most of his body destroyed in an exploding spaceship (he is able to regenerate his body from his severed hand after &#x27;transplanting&#x27; his soul into his hand and sending it back to his home fortress so that it can regenerate).

The series also further established the history of both the Manhunter and the Saturnian race. The first issue revealed that there was a &quot;real&quot; human John Jones, a police detective who is murdered by corrupt colleagues, and that J&#x27;onzz subsequently assumed his identity to complete an important court case.

In issues of &quot;JLA&quot; written by Joe Kelly, J&#x27;onzz attempts to conquer his fear of fire and makes a deal with a flame-wielding villainess named Scorch, who wants J&#x27;onzz&#x27;s telepathic help in dealing with her own mental issues, the two falling in love in the process. This effort results in J&#x27;onzz briefly transforming into the Burning Martian, Fernus, an ancient version of the Martian race that were modified by the Guardians of the Universe; the Guardians had recognized the danger that the Burning Martians posed to civilized life as they &#x27;reproduced&#x27; through the psychic energy generated by suffering and grief, but had simply engineered the Martians into their new state rather than destroy them. As part of this engineering, the Martians had been &#x27;programmed&#x27; with a new vulnerability to fire, with J&#x27;onzz breaking the genetic blocks against fire, also giving him access to race memories of the Burning Martians. Despite Fernus&#x27; power, the League were able to help J&#x27;onzz reassert himself over Fernus, Manitou Raven helping key League members access J&#x27;onzz&#x27;s mind and draw out his true self while Plastic Man battled Fernus directly, allowing the true J&#x27;onzz to manifest when Fernus attempted to spawn using the psychic grief caused by the destruction of the city of Chongjin, the sorrow enough for at least one spawning even if the Flash had saved the city&#x27;s residents. With Fernus&#x27; physical form defeated, J&#x27;onzz&#x27;s traditional aversion to fire was redefined, as he is now invulnerable to flames unless they are &quot;flames of passion&quot; or of some other &quot;psychic significance&quot;. This change is forgotten about in later series and adventures .

===&quot;Crisis&quot; era (mid-2000s–early-2010s)===
Several weeks before &quot;World War III&quot;, Martian Manhunter disguises himself as a young girl and tries to defeat Black Adam telepathically in Bialya. He is defeated by being exposed to Adam&#x27;s darkest memories and flees Earth. The miniseries &quot;World War III&quot; is told from his perspective. Using these events as a catalyst, DC Comics redesigned the appearance of the character, changing his costume and giving him an appearance that more closely resembles that of his Martian form. Those changes were further explored during a &quot;Martian Manhunter&quot; miniseries that spun out of the &quot;&quot; one-shot. Written by A.J. Lieberman with art from Al Barrionuevo and Bit, the series portrayed a Manhunter more mistrustful of humanity and their actions towards each other. The miniseries focuses on J&#x27;onzz&#x27;s search for other survivors of Mars.

During the lead-up to the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; miniseries, the character is feared to have been killed in an attack on the Justice League&#x27;s HQ. He is later revealed to be alive and a captive of Alexander Luthor, Jr. After &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, most of DC&#x27;s series jumped ahead one year, having the weekly series &quot;52&quot; fill in the missing time. In &quot;52&quot; #24, it is revealed that the character has been working behind the scenes in an unsuccessful attempt to destroy Checkmate for its role in the death of Ted Kord.

Following this miniseries, J&#x27;onzz was intended to be in &quot;Outsiders&quot; . He appeared in the third issue of the &quot;Outsiders: Five of a Kind&quot; series with Thunder, and joined the team afterward. Due to the change of writers, he was quickly written out within the last two issues . He was next seen working undercover during the events of the limited series &quot;Salvation Run&quot;. At the end of the series, J&#x27;onzz is left captured and alone on an alien planet.

In &quot;Final Crisis&quot; #1 (2008), written by Grant Morrison the character is killed, with the death being further developed in the one-shot &quot;Final Crisis: Requiem&quot;. The character next appears in the &quot;Blackest Night&quot; storyline as a Black Lantern At the end of the miniseries, the character is resurrected. Following this, the character is featured in the weekly &quot;Brightest Day&quot; series. During the series, J&#x27;onzz encounters another surviving Green Martian, D&#x27;kay D&#x27;razz, a scarred and warped psychopath who wants J&#x27;onzz to be her mate.

In &quot;Brightest Day&quot;, he is a very prominent character, finding a water source on Mars and meeting and talking with the daughter of Dr. Erdel, Melissa. J&#x27;onzz is depicted tucking her into bed in a retirement home, in the form of her father. He later appears at Erdel&#x27;s old lab. However, plant life starts to die every time he gets near. Later still, J&#x27;onzz goes to see M&#x27;gann M&#x27;orzz in Australia during her mediation search, but finds her beaten and tied up. While tending to her, he is contacted by the Entity, who instructs him to burn down the newly formed forest. When J&#x27;onzz asks M&#x27;gann who did this to her, M&#x27;gann says she was attacked by a female Green Martian. After this, J&#x27;onzz senses something in Star City. J&#x27;onzz arrives in Star City&#x27;s new forest and attempts to complete his task; however, he is stopped from doing that by the Entity. The Entity reveals to him that the newly formed forest J&#x27;onzz is to burn down is on Mars. After J&#x27;onzz lashes out at Star City&#x27;s forest, he returns home. During this same time period, J&#x27;onzz is found by Green Arrow, who attacks J&#x27;onzz after mistaking him for some sort of monster. After being knocked unconscious and dragged out of the forest by Green Arrow, J&#x27;onzz explains that the forest somehow tampered with his Martian shape-shifting abilities and temporarily drove him mad. When J&#x27;onzz arrives home, he sees his planet covered in a newly formed forest on Mars.

When J&#x27;onzz enters his home, he is confronted by a female Green Martian named D&#x27;kay D&#x27;razz, the same Green Martian who attacked M&#x27;gann. D&#x27;kay explains her origins and wants to be J&#x27;onzz&#x27;s mate. J&#x27;onzz refuses and learns that she is a psychopath when D&#x27;kay angrily lashes out to attack and enters his mind. J&#x27;onzz tries to resist influence from D&#x27;kay&#x27;s mind, but her control over his mind tempts him with visions of a fantasy world where all the Martians and J&#x27;onzz&#x27;s family are resurrected by the Entity. While reunited with his lost family, J&#x27;onzz discovers that they are false and realizes that they are a ruse and the death corpse is carved of Martian symbols of love and hate from D&#x27;kay&#x27;s influence. J&#x27;onzz arrives vengeful and wrings D&#x27;kay&#x27;s neck in disgust. J&#x27;onzz defeats D&#x27;kay by forcing her into the Sun, saved from the same fate by the White Lantern Entity, who informs him that his mission has been accomplished, and returns his life to him. The Entity then tells J&#x27;onzz to choose between Mars and Earth. J&#x27;onzz chooses Earth and returns to his adopted homeworld only to be absorbed into the earth by the Entity as &quot;part of the plan&quot;.

When the &quot;Dark Avatar&quot; makes his presence known, J&#x27;onzz is revealed to be one of the Elementals. Martian Manhunter is transformed by the Entity to become the element of Earth to protect the Star City forest from the &quot;Dark Avatar&quot;, which appears to be the Black Lantern version of the Swamp Thing. The Elementals are then fused with the body of Alec Holland to transform him into Swamp Thing and battle the Dark Avatar. After the Dark Avatar is defeated, Swamp Thing restores J&#x27;onzz to normal. Afterward, J&#x27;onzz helps Melissa, Saul Erdel&#x27;s daughter, remove the piece from her head after she loses her mind.

===&quot;The New 52&quot; (2011–2016)===
In 2011, DC relaunched its continuity following its &quot;Flashpoint&quot; company-wide crossover as part of its &quot;The New 52&quot; publishing event, which saw the cancellation and relaunch of all DC titles. In the new continuity, J&#x27;onzz is reintroduced as a member of the covert Stormwatch organization, which had previously appeared exclusively in comics set in DC&#x27;s Wildstorm Comics imprint. J&#x27;onzz is initially stated as being an ex-Justice League member in &quot;Stormwatch&quot; #1, before the phrase &quot;with the Justice League&quot; is retconned as shorthand for being a public superhero, with J&#x27;onzz saying he never tried to join the League due to his commitments to Stormwatch. This same position is stated by J&#x27;onzz again in &quot;Legion Lost&quot; (vol. 2) #6. However, later &quot;Justice League&quot; comics show that J&#x27;onzz was indeed a member of the League for a time. Later, DC chose to move Martian Manhunter to its &quot;Justice League of America&quot; title, a spin-off from &quot;Justice League&quot;. In &quot;Stormwatch&quot; (vol. 3) #12, J&#x27;onzz quits the team and uses his telepathy to erase his existence from the minds of his Stormwatch teammates.

In &quot;Justice League of America&quot;, Martian Manhunter is a member of the U.S. government-sponsored Justice League, taking orders from Amanda Waller and Steve Trevor. Like other members of the team, he has been selected as a counterpart for a member of the independent Justice League, should they ever go rogue; J&#x27;onzz is Superman&#x27;s counterpart. He also appears in &quot;Justice League&quot;; when Despero assaults the Watchtower, he is mentioned by Firestorm as having been a member of the Justice League when it initially fought with Despero. When Despero incapacitates Firestorm, Element Woman, and the Atom, Martian Manhunter appears and defeats him with a telepathic assault. Working with his JLA colleagues in &quot;Justice League of America&quot;, he investigates the activities of the Secret Society of Super Villains, led by the Outsider. Later, the two Leagues meet, along with the supernaturally-powered Justice League Dark in the &quot;Trinity War&quot; crossover storyline because of a diplomatic crisis in Kahndaq triggered by the young superhero Shazam. The three Leagues are gathered together when the Outsider reveals himself to be an evil counterpart of Batman&#x27;s butler Alfred Pennyworth from Earth-Three, and witnesses the arrival of Earth-Three&#x27;s evil Justice League&#x27;s counterparts, the Crime Syndicate. The three Leagues are soundly defeated, and Martian Manhunter is trapped inside the Firestorm matrix along with his colleagues by Firestorm&#x27;s evil counterpart Deathstorm. While inside Firestorm, for the duration of the &quot;Forever Evil&quot;-themed issues of the &quot;Justice League of America&quot; title, Manhunter and Stargirl shared a close adventure interlinked with one another&#x27;s memories as Despero assisted the Syndicate with keeping the JLA imprisoned. After being freed in &quot;Forever Evil&quot; #7, the two remain close friends, and along with Green Arrow go on to form the core of a new successor Justice League based out of Canada, in &quot;Justice League United&quot;.

J&#x27;onn&#x27;s new origin is revealed in vol. 4 of &quot;Martian Manhunter&quot; (2015–2016). When he lived there, Mars was originally a living, thriving world millions of years ago. After received a psychic warning, a young J&#x27;onn was recruited along with others by the Martian government to investigate a potential threat. He was eventually betrayed by Ma&#x27;alefa&#x27;ak, who murdered all of the subjects except J&#x27;onn. He was then subjected to a magic blood ritual that gave him his powers. After escaping, he began to hunt down Ma&#x27;alefa&#x27;ak, only to discover a monster which was the cause of the psychic warning. The monster, taking the shape of J&#x27;onn J&#x27;onzz&#x27;s son, revealed that it was the physical manifestation of Mars, saying that it needed help, only to believe that the Martians were unworthy of life. As a result, Mars and all of its inhabitants died and J&#x27;onn was sent to Earth. Before he landed, he split himself into multiply identities that would not reunite until millions of years later but with no memories of his origins.

Martian Manhunter seemingly died while trying to stop a series of bombings. However, it was revealed that there were still pieces of him that lived on after he landed on Earth, and they began to bring him back together. After being teleported to an alternate Mars, Ma&#x27;alefa&#x27;ak, revealed to be another construct of J&#x27;onn&#x27;s memories, plans to use them in another ritual to bring back the actual Mars with himself as its ruler. After this plan was foiled, J&#x27;onn is revived with all of the remaining constructs merging back with him, finally coming to accept that he truly is the last Martian.

===&quot;DC Rebirth&quot; (2016–present)===
Prior to the events of &quot;Dark Nights: Metal&quot;, J’onn leaves Thanagar looking for Nth metal. After freeing an imprisoned Mister Terrific, Green Lantern, and Plastic Man, three Dark Knights appear and use Thanagar&#x27;s Phoenix Cannon to fire Plastic Man at Earth&#x27;s core, causing a chain reaction that will drag everything into the Dark Multiverse. He is imprisoned by the Dark Knights along with other heroes before being rescued by Wonder Woman. Following the conclusion of &quot;No Justice&quot;, he rejoins the Justice League as its new chairman.

==Powers and abilities==
J&#x27;onzz possesses a wide variety of abilities native to the Green Martian race such as super-strength, nigh-invulnerability, superspeed, flight, regeneration, shapeshifting, intangibility, invisibility, telepathy, telekinesis, and heat vision.

===Physical===
The Martian Manhunter has shapeshifting abilities. He often takes the human disguise of Detective John Jones. He has often been shown to grow an extra pair of arms to supplement his fighting abilities and his strength, such as when he helped move 1/3 of the Earth with Superman and Wonder Woman, knocked out Shazam once, stopping a ship many times larger than the planet from colliding with Earth in tandem with Superman, and destroying the Moon whose gravity was increased a billionfold to the point it was tearing off the Earth&#x27;s crust and ejecting every continent into the atmosphere. He can become stiff or malleable, as well as alter the size and length of limbs. He has elongated parts of himself into bladed weapons during combat. His density is also variable and changes as he wills it. He can use this ability to become intangible and move through objects or allow attacks to fly harmlessly through him or to become extremely dense and increase his invulnerability. J&#x27;onzz can also become invisible. In addition to these powers, he can fly and possesses super strength.

===Psionic/mental/psychic and extrasensory===
J&#x27;onn J&#x27;onzz is the most powerful telepath on Earth, being able to control and affect even the Spectre and Doctor Fate with his telepathy. Aquaman has stated that Martian Manhunter&#x27;s telepathy exceeds even the telepathy of other members of the Martian race. He said that with J&#x27;onzz&#x27;s great telepathic power, his own telepathy just &quot;pings&quot; off of him while, when Aquaman was in the presence of J&#x27;onzz&#x27;s brother, Ma&#x27;alefa&#x27;ak, there was no such effect. J&#x27;onzz is capable of linking the minds of all superheroes at once from a distance of the Moon to all corners of Earth, even once scanning the entire galaxy to see if anyone was not experiencing a brief moment of transcendent bliss. He is also capable of reading the minds of all inhabitants of Earth at once. His telepathic abilities also allow him to create realistic illusions; telepathically trace and locate people; shut down people&#x27;s minds; brain blast; mental shield; influence thoughts; mind control people; manipulate memory; astral projection; possession; induce sleep; reprogram or reorder minds; and transfer information directly into people&#x27;s brains. Martian Manhunter&#x27;s mind control capabilities have allowed him to mind control the Joker and make him temporarily sane, as well as mind controlling several White Martians at once. He is also capable of mentally shielding those around him from telepathic assault. His own mental defenses are so strong that he is able to telepathically shield himself from the combined might of several White Martians and from the Mageddon machinery. He has at times also demonstrated limited telekinetic abilities, though such showings are rare and often forgotten.

===Enhanced Martian senses===
J&#x27;onzz possesses &quot;Martian vision&quot; allowing his eyes to see across the electromagnetic spectrum, including X-ray vision. He can also project energy beams, known as &quot;Martian beams&quot;, the exact effects of which have varied in different decades from incendiary effects to concussive impacts to disintegration. J&#x27;onzz also has nine senses compared to humans, giving him clearer and more numerous perceptions.

===Natural skills and talents===
Aside from his superpowered abilities as a Martian, J&#x27;onzz is also a master detective and sleuth. Due to his training as a Manhunter in Mars, he is also an expert tracker and hand-to-hand combatant, far above the average Martian, as he has been shown able to defeat many White Martians at once. As Batman mentions in his file, &quot;in many ways, Martian Manhunter is like an amalgam of Superman and the Dark Knight himself&quot;.

===Weakness and limitations===
One of J&#x27;onzz&#x27;s signature traits is his vulnerability to fire. Although it has been an element of the character since his earliest appearances, it has been depicted differently by writers.

In his earliest appearances, he was shown as having a weakness to fire while in his native Martian form. Over time, this was developed into , with fire being the Martian&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, equivalent to Superman&#x27;s weakness to kryptonite. Exposure to fire typically causes J&#x27;onzz to lose his ability to maintain his physical form and melt into plasma. One portrayal explained that the flame weakness was tied into Martian telepathy, with fire causing so much chaos in Martian minds that they collapse. The &quot;Trial By Fire&quot; storyline reveals that the Martian weakness to fire is a psychosomatic effect created by the Guardians of the Universe to prevent the species from reverting to a previous, highly aggressive evolutionary state. At the end of the arc, this weakness to mundane fire was removed, with J&#x27;onzz explaining that now only fires of &quot;psychic significance&quot; could harm him, such as flames of a magical or pyrokinetic nature, or even flames created by an arsonist.

In &quot;The New 52&quot;, the weakness to fire is pyrophobia that is unique to him as a crippling anxiety, due to the trauma of witnessing the Martians&#x27; extinction.

==List of enemies==
The following are enemies of Martian Manhunter:
* Bel Juz – A Green Martian who survived the fate of Mars and used her womanly wiles and devious mind to manipulate those around her.

<text>Alan Kenneth Mackenzie Clark (13 April 1928 – 5 September 1999) was a British Conservative Member of Parliament (MP), author and diarist. He served as a junior minister in Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s governments at the Departments of Employment, Trade and Defence. He became a member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom in 1991.

He was the author of several books of military history, including his controversial work &quot;The Donkeys&quot; (1961), which inspired the musical satire &quot;Oh, What a Lovely War!&quot;

Clark became known for his flamboyance, wit, irreverence and keen support of animal rights. Norman Lamont called him &quot;the most politically incorrect, outspoken, iconoclastic and reckless politician of our times&quot;. His three-volume &quot;Alan Clark Diaries&quot; contains a candid account of political life under Thatcher and a description of the weeks preceding his death, which he continued to write until he could no longer focus on the page.

== Early life ==
Alan Clark was born at 55 Lancaster Gate, London, the elder son of art historian Kenneth Clark (later Lord Clark), who was of Scottish parentage, and his wife Elizabeth Winifred Clark (&quot;née&quot; Martin), who was Irish. His sister and brother, fraternal twins Colette (known as Celly) and Colin, were born in 1932. At the age of six he began as a day boy at Egerton House, a preparatory school in Marylebone, and from there at the age of nine went on as a boarder to St Cyprian&#x27;s School, Eastbourne. Clark was one of the seventy boys rescued when the school building was destroyed by fire in May 1939. He was relocated with the school to Midhurst.

In September 1940, with the Luftwaffe threatening south-east England, the Clarks moved their son to a safer location at Cheltenham College Junior School. From there he went to Eton in January 1942. In February 1946 while at Eton he joined the training regiment of the Household Cavalry based at Combermere Barracks, Windsor. He transferred to the regiment&#x27;s Territorial unit the same day, but was discharged in August when he had left Eton. Later that year, he was called up for national service in the Royal Air Force Education Branch, but was exempted after citing his experience in the Household Cavalry while at Eton, which his biographer Ion Trewin described as &quot;a bit like doing Officer Training Corps&quot;, but which Clark would later again embellish as prior military service in a CV for a possible parliamentary candidacy.

He then went to Christ Church, Oxford, where he read Modern History under Hugh Trevor-Roper, obtaining a third-class honours degree. As an undergraduate he was a member of the Bullingdon Club, a private all-male dining club known for its wealthy members, grand banquets, and bad behaviour, including vandalism of restaurants and students&#x27; rooms. The club selects its members not only on the grounds of wealth and willingness to participate but also by means of education. After Oxford he wrote articles for the motoring press before he went on to read for the bar. He was called to the bar in 1955 but did not practise law. Instead, he began privately studying military history with a view to professional writing on the topic.

==Military history==
Clark&#x27;s first book, &quot;The Donkeys&quot; (1961), was a revisionist history of the British Expeditionary Force&#x27;s (BEF) campaigns at the beginning of the First World War. The book covers Western Front operations during 1915, including the offensives at Neuve Chapelle, Aubers Ridge and Loos, and ending with the enforced resignation of Sir John French as commander-in-chief of the BEF, and his replacement by Douglas Haig. Clark describes the battle scenes, and criticises the actions of several of the generals involved in the heavy loss of life that occurred. Much of the book is based on the political manoeuvres behind the scenes as commanders jostled for influence, and John French&#x27;s difficulties dealing with his French allies and with Lord Kitchener. Haig&#x27;s own diaries are used to demonstrate how Haig positioned himself to take over command. The publication sold well, and is still in print 50 years after its first print run, being regarded as an important work on the British experience of the World War.

The book&#x27;s title was drawn from the expression &quot;Lions led by donkeys&quot; which has been widely used to compare British soldiers with their commanders. In 1921 Princess Evelyn Blücher published her memoirs, which attributed the phrase to OHL (the German GHQ) in 1918. Clark was unable to find the origin of the expression. He prefaced the book with a supposed dialogue between two generals and attributed the dialogue to the memoirs of German general Erich von Falkenhayn. Clark was equivocal about the source for the dialogue for many years, but in 2007, his friend Euan Graham recalled a conversation in the mid-1960s when Clark, on being challenged as to the dialogue&#x27;s provenance, looked sheepish and said, &quot;Well I invented it.&quot; This supposed invention emboldened critics of &quot;The Donkeys&quot; to condemn the work.

Clark&#x27;s choice of subject was strongly influenced by Lord Lee of Fareham, a family friend who had never forgotten what he saw as the shambles of the BEF. In developing his work, Clark became close friends with historian Basil Liddell Hart, who acted as his mentor. Liddell Hart read the drafts and was concerned by Clark&#x27;s &quot;intermittent carelessness&quot;. He produced several lists of corrections, which were incorporated, and wrote &quot;It is a fine piece of writing, and often brilliantly penetrating.&quot;

Even before publication, Clark&#x27;s work came under attack from supporters of Haig, including the field marshal&#x27;s son and historians John Terraine, Robert Blake and Hugh Trevor-Roper, former tutor to Clark, who was married to Haig&#x27;s daughter. On publication, &quot;The Donkeys&quot; received very supportive comments from Lord Beaverbrook, who recommended the work to Winston Churchill, and &quot;The Times&quot; printed a positive review. However, John Terraine and A. J. P. Taylor wrote damning reviews and historian Michael Howard wrote &quot;As history, it is worthless&quot;, criticising its &quot;slovenly scholarship&quot;. Howard nonetheless commended its readability and noted that descriptions of battles and battlefields are &quot;sometimes masterly&quot;. Field Marshal Montgomery later told Clark it was &quot;A Dreadful Tale: You have done a good job in exposing the total failure of the generalship&quot;.

In more recent years, the work has been criticised by some historians for being one-sided in its treatment of World War One generals. Brian Bond, in editing a 1991 collection of essays on First World War history, expressed the collective desire of the authors to move beyond &quot;popular stereotypes of &quot;The Donkeys&quot;&quot; while also acknowledging that serious leadership mistakes were made and that the authors would do little to rehabilitate the reputations of, for instance, the senior commanders on The Somme.

The historian Peter Simkins complained that it was frustratingly difficult to counter Clark&#x27;s prevailing view. Professor Richard Holmes made a similar complaint, writing that &quot;Alan Clark&#x27;s &quot;The Donkeys&quot;, for all its verve and amusing narrative, added a streak of pure deception to the writings of the First World War. Its title is based on &#x27;Lions led by Donkeys&#x27;. Sadly for historical accuracy, there is no evidence whatever for this; none. Not a jot or scintilla. The real problem is that such histories have sold well and continue to do so. They reinforce historical myth by delivering to the reader exactly what they expect to read&quot;. Clark&#x27;s work was described as &quot;contemptible&quot; by Henry Paget, 7th Marquess of Anglesey who regarded Clark as the most arrogant and least respectable writer on the War, but the impartiality of this view may have been overshadowed by the fact that Anglesey&#x27;s own history of the British Cavalry had been reviewed by Clark with the comments &quot;cavalry are nearly always a disaster, a waste of space and resources.&quot; Graham Stewart, Clark&#x27;s researcher for a later political history that he would write entitled &quot;The Tories&quot;, noted: &quot;Alan wasn&#x27;t beyond quoting people selectively to make them look bad&quot;.

Clark went on to publish several more works of military history through the 1960s, including &quot;Barbarossa&quot; in 1965 examining the Operation Barbarossa offensive of the Second World War; he also tried his hand at novel writing, but none of the subsequent books were as commercially successful or drew the same attention as &quot;The Donkeys&quot; had achieved, and he abandoned the path of military history in the mid-1970s to pursue a professional career in national politics.

== Political career ==

Clark&#x27;s first foray into politics was on the issue of the Common Market, which he opposed. With those beliefs, he joined the Conservative Monday Club in 1968, and was soon chairman of its Wiltshire branch. In 1971 he was blacklisted by Conservative Party Central Office for being too right-wing, but after representations by him, and others, he was removed from the blacklist.

He unsuccessfully sought the Conservative selection for Weston super-Mare in 1970, missing out to Jerry Wiggin. He subsequently became MP for Plymouth Sutton at the February 1974 general election with a majority of 8,104, when Harold Wilson took over from Edward Heath as prime minister of a minority Labour government. At the General Election in October 1974, when Labour gained a small overall majority, Clark&#x27;s vote fell by 1,192 votes, but he still had a comfortable majority with 5,188. His first five years in parliament were spent on the Conservative opposition benches. He was still a member of the Monday Club in May 1975. It is unclear when he let his membership of the club lapse, but possibly it was upon becoming a government minister. He continued to address Club events until 1992.

During the subsequent Party leadership contest he was urged by Airey Neave to vote for Margaret Thatcher, but he is thought to have favoured Willie Whitelaw. The following year came the free vote on the Common Market and Clark, praising Enoch Powell&#x27;s speech, voted against. The next day he told the socialist MP Dennis Skinner that &quot;I&#x27;d rather live in a socialist Britain than one ruled by a lot of fucking foreigners.&quot; Although he was personally liked by Margaret Thatcher, for whom he had great admiration, and the columnist George Hutchinson (who, writing in &quot;The Times&quot;, tipped him for inclusion in the Shadow Cabinet), Clark was never promoted to the cabinet, remaining in mid-ranking ministerial positions during the 1980s.

=== First portfolios ===
Clark received his first ministerial posting as a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Employment in 1983, where he was responsible for moving the approval of regulations relating to equal pay in the House of Commons. His speech in 1983 followed a wine-tasting dinner with his friend of many years standing, Christopher Selmes. Irritated by what he regarded as a bureaucratically written civil-service speech, he galloped through the script, skipping over pages of text. The then-opposition MP Clare Short stood up on a point of order and, after acknowledging that MPs cannot formally accuse each other of being drunk in the House of Commons, accused him of being &quot;incapable&quot;, a euphemism for drunk. Although the government benches were furious at the accusation, Clark later admitted in his diaries that the wine-tasting had affected him. To date, he is the only Member of Parliament to have been accused in the House of Commons of being drunk at the despatch box.

In 1986, Clark was promoted to Minister for Trade at the Department of Trade and Industry. It was during this time that he became involved with the issue of export licences to Iraq, the Matrix-Churchill affair. In 1989, he became Minister for Defence Procurement at the Ministry of Defence.

When Clark was Minister for Trade, responsible for overseeing arms sales to foreign governments, he was interviewed by journalist John Pilger who asked him:
:JP &quot;Did it bother you personally that this British equipment was causing such mayhem and human suffering (by supplying arms for Indonesia&#x27;s war in East Timor)?&quot;
:AC &quot;No, not in the slightest, it never entered my head. You tell me that this was happening, I didn&#x27;t hear about it or know about it.&quot;
:JP &quot;Well, even if I hadn&#x27;t told you it was happening, the fact that we supply highly effective equipment to a regime like that is not a consideration, as far as you&#x27;re concerned. It&#x27;s not a personal consideration. I ask the question because I read you are a vegetarian and you are quite seriously concerned about the way animals are killed.&quot;
:AC &quot;Yeah.&quot;
:JP &quot;Doesn&#x27;t that concern extend to the way humans, albeit foreigners, are killed?&quot;
:AC &quot;Curiously not. No.&quot;

=== Departure and return ===
Clark left Parliament in 1992 following Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s fall from power. His admission during the Matrix Churchill trial that he had been &quot;economical with the &quot;actualité&quot;&quot; in answer to parliamentary questions about what he knew with regard to arms export licences to Iraq, caused the collapse of the trial and the establishment of the Scott Inquiry, which helped undermine John Major&#x27;s government.

Clark became bored with life outside politics and returned to Parliament as member for Kensington and Chelsea in the election of 1997, becoming critical of NATO&#x27;s campaign in the Balkans.

Clark held strong views on British unionism, racial difference, social class, and was in support of animal rights, nationalist protectionism and Euroscepticism. He referred to Enoch Powell as &quot;The Prophet&quot;. Clark once declared: &quot;It is natural to be proud of your race and your country&quot;, and in a departmental meeting, allegedly referred to Africa as &quot;Bongo Bongo Land&quot;. When called to account, however, Clark denied the comment had any racist overtones, claiming it had simply been a reference to the president of Gabon, Omar Bongo.

Clark argued that the media and the government failed to pick out the racism towards white people and ignored any racist attacks on white people. He also, however, described the National Front chairman, John Tyndall, as &quot;a bit of a blockhead&quot; and disavowed his ideas.

On his death in 1999, figures from all sides of politics paid tribute to Clark, though his critics remained. Prime Minister Tony Blair spoke of Clark as &quot;extraordinary, amusing, irreverent, but with real conviction and belief, and behind the headlines, kind and thoughtful.&quot; And the Liberal Democrat, Simon Hughes, described him as &quot;courageous, idiosyncratic, talented and principled. However, journalist Dominic Lawson criticised Clark as &quot;sleazy, vindictive, greedy, callous and cruel&quot;, while Ion Trewin (subsequently his biographer) referred to Clark as &quot;wonderful&quot;.

Clark was a passionate supporter of animal rights, joining activists in demonstrations at Dover against live export, and outside the House of Commons in support of Animal Liberation Front hunger-striker Barry Horne.

== Diaries ==
Clark kept a regular diary from 1955 until August 1999 (during his second spell as a Member of Parliament) when he was incapacitated due to the onset of the brain tumour which was to be the cause of his death a month later. The last month of his life would be chronicled by his wife, Jane. The diaries covering the period 1983 to 1992 were published after he left the House of Commons, deciding not to seek re-election to his Plymouth Sutton seat. Published in 1993 and known simply as &quot;Diaries&quot; (although later subtitled &quot;In Power&quot;), they have been recognised as a definitive account of the downfall of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. They caused a minor embarrassment at the time with their descriptions of senior Conservative politicians such as Michael Heseltine, Douglas Hurd, and Kenneth Clarke. He quoted Michael Jopling – referring to Heseltine, deputy PM at the time – as saying &quot;The trouble with Michael is that he had to buy all his furniture&quot; and judged it &quot;Snobby, but cutting&quot;. Two subsequent volumes of his diaries cover the earlier and later parts of Clark&#x27;s parliamentary career. The diaries reveal recurring worries about Japanese militarism but his real views are often not clear because he enjoyed making &quot;tongue in cheek&quot; remarks to the discomfiture of those he believed to be fools, as in his sympathy for a British version of National Socialism.

Before his death in 1999, Clark had started work on the prequel to the 1983–1992 &quot;Diaries&quot; to cover his entry in politics, from seeking a Conservative Association to adopt him as their Parliamentary Candidate in 1972 until the 1983 general election. Published a year after his death, this volume was titled &quot;Diaries: Into Politics&quot; and covered 1972 to 1983.

The final volume, covering Clark&#x27;s decision not to seek re-election at the 1992 general election, his regret at leaving the House of Commons and then his return to Parliament, was published in 2002 and included Clark&#x27;s final days dying from a brain tumour.

Throughout his diaries Clark refers admiringly to Henry &quot;Chips&quot; Channon and his diaries. He also quotes Adolf Hitler, to whom he refers as &quot;Wolf&quot;.

The diaries include much reference to Clark&#x27;s love of his chalet at Zermatt, his Scottish estate at Eriboll and the architecture of and country around Saltwood Castle, his home in Kent. Clark&#x27;s fascination with classic cars is also evident, as is his enthusiasm for backgammon.

The Diaries were serialised into six episodes of &quot;The Alan Clark Diaries&quot; by the BBC and shown in 2004 with John Hurt and Jenny Agutter.
== Personal life ==
In 1958, Clark, aged 30, married 16-year-old (Caroline) Jane, daughter of Colonel Leslie Brindley Bream Beuttler OBE of the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment and a descendant on her mother&#x27;s side of the Scottish ornithologist William Robert Ogilvie-Grant, grandson of the 6th Earl of Seafield. They were married for 41 years and had two sons:

* James Alasdair Kenneth Clark (born 1960, died 15 August 2019)
* Andrew McKenzie Clark (born 1962)

His elder son James (who lived in Eriboll, a Scottish estate) died of a brain tumour on 15 August 2019, aged 59.

While involved in the Matrix Churchill trial he was cited in a divorce case in South Africa, in which it was revealed he had had affairs with Valerie Harkess, the wife of a South African barrister, and her daughters, Josephine and Alison. After sensationalist tabloid headlines, Clark&#x27;s wife Jane remarked upon what Clark had called &quot;the coven&quot; with the line: &quot;Well, what do you expect when you sleep with below-stairs types?&quot; She referred to her husband as an &quot;S, H, one, T&quot;.

==Death==
Clark died at Saltwood Castle on 5 September 1999, aged 71, after suffering from a brain tumour. His body was buried in the grounds of the castle. Upon his death, his family said Clark wanted it to be stated that he had &quot;gone to join Tom and the other dogs.&quot;

== Media ==
In 1993 Clark gave a half-hour &quot;Opinions&quot; lecture, televised by Channel 4, of which he said in his diary: &quot;It was good. Clear, assured, moving. I looked compos and in my &#x27;prime&#x27;. Many people saw it. All were enthusiastic. Today acres of coverage in &quot;The Times&quot;.&quot; In 1997 Clark presented a four-part series for the BBC entitled &quot;Alan Clark&#x27;s History of the Tory Party&quot;.

In 2004, John Hurt portrayed Clark (and Jenny Agutter his wife Jane) in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Alan Clark Diaries&quot;, reigniting some of the controversies surrounding their original publication and once again brought his name into the British press and media. An authorised biography of Alan Clark by Ion Trewin, the editor of his diaries, was published in September 2009.

<doc id="413962" wikidata="Q258738" url="?curid=413962" title="Bob Ainsworth">
<text>Robert William Ainsworth (born 19 June 1952) is a British Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Coventry North East from 1992 to 2015, and was the Secretary of State for Defence from 2009 to 2010. Following the general election in 2010 he was the Shadow Defence Secretary, but was replaced by Jim Murphy following the election of Labour leader Ed Miliband.

==Early life==
Ainsworth was born in Coventry on 19 June 1952, and attended the local Foxford Comprehensive School. From 1971 to 1991, he was a sheet metal worker and fitter at Jaguar. He first became active in politics as a trade unionist at the Jaguar Cars plant in Coventry where he worked and served in many union capacities, including as Branch President (in what was later to become part of the Manufacturing, Science and Finance union). In 1984, he was elected to Coventry City Council, became Chair of the Finance Committee, and was deputy leader of the ruling Labour group. He was also Constituency Labour Party chairman.

==Parliamentary career==
Ainsworth tried to become Labour candidate for Coventry North East in the run-up to the 1987 general election, after George Park MP announced his retirement, but only came third at the selection meeting, behind John Hughes and Ted Knight. In the run-up to the 1992 general election, Hughes was de-selected by the Constituency Labour Party, and Ainsworth became the candidate. He was elected with an 11,676 majority, and stepped down from the city council the following year. At the 1997 general election his majority rose sharply to 22,569, falling back to 15,751 at the 2001 election, and 14,222 at the 2005 election.

On 7 December 2012, Ainsworth announced his intention not to stand at the 2015 general election.

===In Government===
Ainsworth was appointed a Labour whip in 1995 and served in government until January 2001 when he was promoted to Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the former Department for Environment, Transport and the Regions. Following the 2001 general election, Ainsworth was moved to the Home Office as Parliamentary Under-Secretary with responsibility for Drugs and Organised Crime, where he remained until 2003, when he became the Deputy Chief Whip (also known as the Treasurer of the Household). He was appointed to the Privy Council in February 2005. On 29 June 2007, he moved to become the Minister of State for the Armed Forces.

===Defence Secretary===
On 5 June 2009, he was appointed to the cabinet by Gordon Brown as Secretary of State for Defence, in what was considered by some to be &quot;a surprise choice&quot;. As Defence Secretary, Ainsworth declared in July 2009 that &quot;the government should have offered more support to British troops at the beginning of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.&quot;

At the Labour Party Conference in Brighton in 2009, Ainsworth stated that sending reinforcements to Afghanistan may not be possible because of a lack of necessary military resources. He said, &quot;Before I agree to any increase in troop numbers I must be sure that the balance of risk is acceptable by evaluating the capacity of the supply chain to properly equip the increased force.&quot;

==Expenses==
In the 2009 Parliamentary expenses scandal, in which a number of MPs were criticised for their expense claims, it was revealed that, in 2007–08, Ainsworth had claimed the maximum permissible amount of £23,083 for second-home allowances, making him the joint highest claimant that year with 142 other MPs. For 2008–09, he claimed £20,304, 269th out of 647 MPs.

==Legalisation of drugs==
Ainsworth launched the Home Office&#x27;s &quot;Safer Clubbing&quot; guide in 2002 which provided guidance to nightclub owners on harm reduction relating to recreational drug use.

In December 2010, Ainsworth called for the legalisation and regulation of drugs, arguing it is better for addicts to receive their fixes on prescription rather than relying for their supply on the international criminal gangs that make billions of pounds from the trade. As a Home Office minister, Ainsworth was responsible for drugs policy.

==Personal life==
In 1974, Ainsworth married Gloria. Together they have two daughters.

In May 2019, Ainsworth revealed that he had voted for the Green Party in that month&#x27;s European Parliament election. He called it an &quot;I&#x27;m Spartacus&quot; moment, stating: &quot;I voted Green in the Euro elections having never voted other than Labour before in my entire life. I didn&#x27;t intend to make this public, but now Alastair has been expelled for doing the same I feel obliged to do so.&quot; This was in reference to the expulsion of Alastair Campbell for revealing that he had voted for the Liberal Democrats at the same election.

<doc id="413965" wikidata="Q259106" url="?curid=413965" title="Douglas Alexander">
<text>Douglas Garven Alexander (born 26 October 1967) is a British politician who has served as Minister of State for Trade Policy and Economic Security since 2024, having previously held the role from 2004 to 2005. He has also served as Minister of State in the Cabinet Office since 2025. A member of the Labour Party, he has been Member of Parliament (MP) for Lothian East since 2024. He was previously MP for Paisley and Renfrewshire South, formerly Paisley South, from 1997 to 2015 and served as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Scottish Secretary, Transport Secretary and International Development Secretary in the cabinets of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.

Alexander was first elected at the 1997 Paisley South by-election. In 2001, he was appointed by Tony Blair as Minister of State for and Competitiveness in the Department of Trade and Industry. He was Minister of State for the Cabinet Office from 2002 to 2003. In 2003, he was promoted to Minister for the Cabinet Office and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. In 2004, he was appointed Minister of State for Trade. Following the 2005 general election, he was appointed Minister of State for Europe and made a member of the Privy Council. During this period, he started attending cabinet. In 2006, he was appointed to serve jointly as both Secretary of State for Scotland and Secretary of State for Transport. In 2007, when Gordon Brown became Prime Minister, he appointed Alexander as Secretary of State for International Development.

After Labour lost the 2010 general election Alexander co-chaired David Miliband&#x27;s leadership campaign. When Ed Miliband became the party&#x27;s leader, Alexander was elected to the Shadow cabinet and was made the Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. He held this position until a 2011 reshuffle, when he was appointed Shadow Foreign Secretary. In October 2013, he was appointed by Miliband as the party&#x27;s chair of general election strategy. In 2015, he lost his seat to 20 year-old Mhairi Black of the Scottish National Party, in what was one of the worst results for Labour; with forty seats lost to the SNP nationwide.

In December 2022, Alexander sought out a return to Parliament by applying to be Labour&#x27;s parliamentary candidate for East Lothian, held by the Alba Party&#x27;s Kenny MacAskill. He won the selection to stand for the Labour and Co-operative parties in the constituency in February 2023 and was elected as the MP for the redrawn Lothian East constituency in July 2024.

==Early life and career==
Alexander was born in Glasgow, the son of Joyce Oliver Alexander (née Garven), a doctor, and Douglas Niven Alexander, a Church of Scotland minister. Much of his childhood was spent in Bishopton in Renfrewshire. Alexander attended his local comprehensive school Park Mains High School in Erskine, also in Renfrewshire, from where he joined the Labour Party as a schoolboy in 1982.

In 1984 he won a Scottish scholarship to attend Lester B. Pearson United World College of the Pacific in Canada, where he gained the International Baccalaureate Diploma, returning to Scotland to study politics and modern history at the University of Edinburgh. He spent 1988/89, the third of his four undergraduate years, at the University of Pennsylvania as part of the exchange scheme between the two universities. When studying in America, he worked for Michael Dukakis during the 1988 American presidential election campaign, and also worked for a Democratic senator in Washington DC. He graduated from the University of Edinburgh with a first-class degree in 1990.

In 1990, Alexander worked as a speech writer and parliamentary researcher for Shadow Trade and Industry Secretary Gordon Brown. He returned to Edinburgh to study for an LLB at the University of Edinburgh, where he won the Novice Moot Trophy and graduated with distinction in 1993. He then qualified as a Scottish solicitor. On qualifying as a solicitor, he worked for a firm of solicitors in Edinburgh that provided legal services to Trade Union members and specialised in industrial injury cases.

==Political career==

===Perth and Kinross===
Whilst still studying in 1995 and with friends in the local Constituency Labour Party and the backing of his mentor shadow chancellor Gordon Brown, he was selected to be The Labour Party in Scotland candidate at the Perth and Kinross by-election caused by the death of the Conservative MP Nicholas Fairbairn. The by-election in the highly volatile Tory seat of Perth and Kinross came in the middle of the John Major government and was won by Roseanna Cunningham of the Scottish National Party, but Alexander received enough votes to push the Conservative candidate into third place. It was a seat where Labour had never previously done particularly well, and the result, which saw Labour overtake the Conservatives and move up to second place, broke several post war election records. This brought him to the attention of party leader Tony Blair, and shortly after his defeat by the SNP he was welcomed at The Labour Party in Scotland Conference in the Eden Court Theatre in Inverness where he spoke immediately before Blair in the critical debate on abolition of Clause IV of the Labour Party Constitution.

When the Perth and Kinross constituency was abolished, Alexander was chosen to be the Labour candidate in the newly drawn Perth constituency at the 1997 general election. Once again, Labour achieved a further swing with Alexander securing 24.8% share of the vote compared to 22.9% achieved during the 1995 by-election, though pushed into third place.

===Member of Parliament===
On 28 July 1997, Gordon McMaster, the Labour Member of Parliament for Paisley South, committed suicide. Alexander, who grew up in Renfrewshire, was chosen to contest the by-election and he was elected to serve as the Member of Parliament for Paisley South on 6 November 1997. In June 2001 he was returned to Westminster with an increased majority. Following the general election in May 2005 Alexander was re-elected, becoming MP for the new constituency of Paisley and Renfrewshire South, as well as promoted to Minister of State for Europe attending Cabinet at the Foreign Office. At the 2010 General Election Alexander was re-elected for Paisley and Renfrewshire South with a majority of 13,232 votes. He lost his seat to 20-year-old Mhairi Black of the Scottish National Party at the general election on 8 May 2015 with a swing against him of 26.9%.

===Minister of state===
Alexander took a successful co-ordinating role in his party&#x27;s campaign for the 2001 general election. He was rewarded by Tony Blair and was appointed Minister of State for and Competitiveness at the Department of Trade and Industry in June 2001. In May 2002, Alexander was transferred to the Cabinet Office as Minister of State. As Minister of State for the Cabinet Office, Alexander oversaw the work of the government&#x27;s Strategy Unit, the Central Office of Information, and the Civil Service.

In June 2003 Alexander was promoted to Minister for the Cabinet Office and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and in September 2004 was moved to Minister of State for Trade at both the Department of Trade and Industry and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

===Cabinet minister===
Following the 2005 general election, he was given the role of Minister of State for Europe, part of the Foreign Office, with special provision to attend Cabinet. During the United Kingdom&#x27;s Presidency of the Council of the European Union, he contributed directly to successful negotiations on agreement of the Multiannual Financial Framework. On 7 June 2005, he was made a Member of the Privy Council.

On 5 May 2006, he was appointed Secretary of State for Transport and, simultaneously, Secretary of State for Scotland, replacing Alistair Darling. On 10 August 2006, Alexander was helicoptered by the Royal Air Force from Scotland to London to join Home Secretary John Reid, in leading the UK Government&#x27;s response to the 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot and attend meetings of COBRA, the government emergencies committee. He worked with police, Intelligence Agencies, the Airlines and the US Department of Homeland Security.

During his time as Scottish Secretary, Alexander oversaw the running of the 2007 Scottish Parliament election. Following Gordon Brown&#x27;s appointment as Prime Minister on 27 June 2007, he appointed Douglas Alexander as Secretary of State for International Development. During this time Alexander served as a governor of the World Bank, the African Development Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank the Caribbean Development Bank, and the Asian Development Bank.

===Election campaign roles===
Alexander took a central role in the first Scottish Parliament elections in 1999 which saw Donald Dewar elected as the first First Minister of Scotland. Alexander is credited with devising the strategy for the campaign, including the successful &#x27;Divorce is an Expensive Business&#x27; messaging unveiled at the Labour Party in Scotland Conference in Glasgow (March 1999). Labour secured 56 seats under the Proportional Representation system, nine short of an overall majority, and agreed to enter a coalition with the 17-strong Liberal Democrats to form the first Government in the newly established Scottish Parliament. Alexander also coordinated Labour&#x27;s successful 2001 General Election Campaign which resulted in another Labour landslide and the Party winning 413 of the 659 seats available: securing a 167-seat majority in the House of Commons. Alexander was appointed by Tony Blair to Labour&#x27;s National Executive Committee in 2003 and was appointed by Gordon Brown to be Labour&#x27;s General Election Coordinator for the 2010 general election campaign. This campaign saw the first televised Leaders&#x27; debates, and Alexander was part of the core team preparing Gordon Brown for each debate, as well as devising the strategy and messaging for the campaign across the UK which would ultimately deny David Cameron&#x27;s Conservatives a Majority in May 2010. Later in that year Alexander accepted the role as co-chair of David Miliband&#x27;s campaign for the leadership of the Labour party. He subsequently was Ed Miliband&#x27;s chair of general election strategy for the Labour 2015 general election campaign.

===Opposition to antisemitism===
In September 2012 Alexander gave an interview to the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; newspaper criticising Ken Livingstone&#x27;s election campaign and calling out anti-Semitic comments made by the former London Mayor. He said Livingstone paid the &quot;deserved price&quot; when he lost the London mayoral election. Alexander said: &quot;Ken&#x27;s campaign too often looked like the past rather than the future and when I saw his remarks about the Jewish community in London in particular, I didn&#x27;t just think it was ill-advised, I thought it was wrong&quot;. Livingstone hit back on Twitter, saying the Shadow Foreign Secretary &quot;represents a failed New Labour project that lost millions of votes&quot;. He also invited him to discuss the issue on his radio show.

Alexander has been a vocal critic of anti-Semitism within the Labour Party and is a supporting member of one of the oldest socialist societies affiliated to the Party: the Jewish Labour Movement. In 2011, Alexander was among the first to publicly condemn Paul Flynn, the Labour MP for Newport West for his comments regarding the religion of Britain&#x27;s first Jewish ambassador to Israel. Alexander, who at the time was serving as Labour&#x27;s Shadow Foreign Secretary, said in response to Flynn&#x27;s comments about Ambassador Matthew Gould that: &quot;The faith of any British diplomat is irrelevant to their capability to their job. To make suggestions otherwise is wrong and offensive&quot;.

===Public speeches===
On 29 June 2010, five years after the Make Poverty History March in Edinburgh, Alexander gave a speech to the Labour Campaign for International Development about the progress made towards achieving the Gleneagles Summit Goals and on the future of International Development.

On 12 October 2011, Alexander delivered the Andrew John Williamson Memorial Lecture, at Stirling University. In his lecture entitled: &quot;A Better Nation?&quot; A Personal Reflection on Scotland&#x27;s Future. Alexander explored the difference between the political ideologies of nationalism and socialism and outlined a strategy for Scottish Labour to reclaim the mantel of devolution and successfully defeat the campaign for Scottish separation.

On 17 January 2013, in a speech to the foreign policy think-tank Chatham House, Alexander outlined his support for the UK to remain a full member state of the European Union but would not support a federal United States of Europe.

On 3 May 2013, Alexander delivered the 4th Judith Hart Memorial Lecture for which he received a lot of media attention for addressing the issue of Scottish Independence ahead of the referendum to be held the following year. Alexander paid tribute to Judith Hart&#x27;s &quot;strong sense of solidarity&quot; advocating for Scotland to vote to remain part of the United Kingdom, saying: &quot;Walking away from others has never been our way – walking with others has been our heritage and to my mind should be our future&quot;.

===Expenses controversy===
During the 2009 MP expenses scandal, Alexander was one of three Labour ministers who &quot;quietly repaid more £50,000 in expenses&quot;. It emerged he had repaid more than £12,000 that he had previously claimed in expenses on his taxpayer-funded second home while also receiving income from a tenant at the same home. This represented double-funding for his second home and was against the expenses rules.

==Career outside Parliament==
After leaving public office, Alexander became a Fisher Family Fellow at Harvard University where he served as a Senior Fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs (2016–2022). He has served as a visiting professor at the University of Chicago (2015) and is currently a visiting professor at New York University (Abu Dhabi). He is also currently a visiting professor at King&#x27;s College London&#x27;s Policy Institute. In November 2015 Alexander started working as a senior advisor to Bono, helping secure investment to tackle global poverty. In March 2016 Alexander joined the Pinsent Masons law firm as a &quot;strategic advisor&quot;. He remains a Member of the UK Privy Council, a Council Member on the European Council of Foreign Relations, and a Trustee of the Royal United Services Institute.

He is a Council Member of the European Council on Foreign Relations, a Trustee of the Royal United Services Institute, and Chair of the Programme Committee at The Ditchley Foundation

===Broadcasting===
Alexander has written and presented programmes for BBC Radio 4 including: the documentary: &quot;A Culture of Encounter&quot; (2017), in which Alexander brought together experts and community organisations to explore the cultural, economic, and political polarising forces in society. He also authored and presented the three part &quot;Belonging&quot; series (2018) comprising these episodes: &#x27;Old Ties&#x27;, &#x27;New Bonds&#x27;, and &#x27;Tomorrow&#x27;s Stories&#x27;. This series, in which Alexander explored the erosion of class, religion and security in society to explain why the ties that previously gave so many a shared sense of belonging have weakened, was nominated by BBC Radio 4 for the International URTI Radio Grand Prix (31st edition) Prize for Public Service Media and Social Networks.

At the end of 2019 Alexander authored and presented a programme called: A Guide to Disagreeing Better. This programme was broadcast in January 2020 and explores why public discourse has become so ill-tempered and lacking in respect. Alexander interviews a range of contributors with personal tales about how to disagree better. The programme received widespread news coverage.

Ahead of COP26 in 2021, Alexander authored and presented a further BBC Radio 4 programme called &#x27;Glasgow: Our Last Best Hope&#x27;, an essential guide to COP26, its hope of success and what the transition to net zero could mean for Glaswegians and all of us, with contributions from John Kerry, Christian Figueres, Mark Carney and Alok Sharma.

In May 2022, Alexander authored and presented &quot;Connections&quot; which examined whether recent crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic and Russo-Ukrainian War, have helped bring people together or driven them apart.

===Bullying claims while chair of UNICEF UK===

Douglas Alexander served as chair of the board of trustees for UNICEF UK from June 2018 to September 2020. Alexander stepped down as chair in September 2020 following accusations of bullying by then-executive director Sasha Deshmukh, although he had the support of the board. A review by Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius which reported in January 2021 described the bullying allegations made by Deshmukh as &quot;unsubstantiated&quot;, and in respect of complaints made by three other employees, said that although Alexander&#x27;s manner &quot;did cause some discomfort and upset to the three employees&quot;, that &quot;when viewed objectively, it did not amount to bullying&quot;.

=== University of Edinburgh ===
In August 2021, Alexander was appointed a General Court Assessor at the University of Edinburgh Court, his alma mater. Alexander is a member of the University of Edinburgh Court, the university&#x27;s highest governing body, and the General Council Business Committee and the Policy and Resources Committee.

== Return to Parliament ==

In December 2022, Alexander sought out a return to Parliament by applying to be Labour&#x27;s parliamentary candidate for East Lothian which at the time was the party&#x27;s #1 target seat in Scotland, held by the Alba Party&#x27;s Kenny MacAskill. He won the selection to stand for Labour in the constituency in February 2023. He won the seat and was re-elected to Parliament for the first time as a Labour Co-op MP in July 2024. He was subsequently appointed Minister of State for Trade Policy and Economic Security on 6 July.

==Publications==
Alexander has written numerous pieces for publication in national newspapers in the UK and the USA including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;.

He has contributed to, authored and edited several books: &quot;New Scotland New Britain&quot; (1999), &quot;Europe in a Global Age&quot; (2005), &quot;Serving a Cause, Serving a Community&quot; (2006), &quot;Renewing our offer not retracing our steps&quot;, The Purple Book (2011), &quot;Influencing Tomorrow: Future Challenges for British Foreign Policy (2013), and &quot;Britain in a complex world&quot;, Why Vote Labour 2015: The Essential Guide (2014) and &quot;Rethink: How We Can Make A Better World&quot; (2021), a collection of essays focused on a global &#x27;reset moment&#x27; with leading international figures giving glimpses of a better future after the pandemic including contributions from Pope Francis, Niall Ferguson, Samantha Power and Paul Krugman.

== Personal life ==
Douglas married Jacqueline Christian in 2000, and together they have a daughter and a son. His sister, Wendy Alexander, was also involved in politics as an MSP until 2011 and briefly as the Leader of the Labour Party in the Scottish Parliament until she resigned in 2008. His father, a Church of Scotland minister, conducted the funeral of the inaugural First Minister of Scotland, Donald Dewar at Glasgow Cathedral in 2000. He is the great-nephew of Cecil Frances Alexander.

<doc id="413967" wikidata="Q475753" url="?curid=413967" title="Jaguar X-Type">
<text>The Jaguar X-Type is a front-engine, all-wheel/front-wheel drive compact executive car manufactured and marketed by Jaguar Cars from 2001 to 2009 under the internal designation &quot;X400&quot;, for a single generation, in sedan/saloon and wagon/estate body styles. In addition to offering Jaguar&#x27;s first station wagon/estate in series production, the X-type would ultimately introduce its first diesel engine, four-cylinder engine and front-wheel drive configuration.

The X-Type was developed during the period when Jaguar was owned by Ford as a division of its Premier Automotive Group (PAG) (1999-2009) — and marked Jaguar&#x27;s entry into the critical compact executive segment. The programme aimed to double the marque&#x27;s worldwide sales — requiring expansion of engineering resources, factory capacity, marketing capability, sales support and service. At launch, &quot;Autocar&quot; called the X-Type &quot;the most important Jaguar ever&quot;.

With annual projections of 100,000 sales, the X-Type recorded a production of 350,000 over its eight-year manufacturing run.

==Overview==
The X-Type, codenamed &quot;X400&quot;, launched in 2001 to compete in the compact executive class dominated by the rear-wheel drive BMW 3 Series and Mercedes-Benz C-Class, despite Ford/Jaguar having no directly competitive platform. Instead, the X-type used a modified version of the front-drive Ford CD132 platform shared with the contemporary Ford Mondeo — with the addition of all-wheel drive (marketed as &quot;Jaguar Traction&quot; or &quot;Jaguar Traction 4&quot;) and handling and steering engineered to minimise front-wheel drive torque-steer.

Initially, the X-Type was available only with all wheel drive, using a centre differential and a compact, maintenance-free viscous coupling with a default split of 60 per cent torque to the rear wheels, 40 per cent to the front wheels. Under loss of traction front or rear, the coupling could vary the front/rear torque split and could fully transfer torque to either front or rear wheels to ensure grip. For the 2004 model year, the viscous coupling was permanently deleted, removing this mechanical limited-slip function. If equipped, the electronic Dynamic Stability Control System could still reduce individual wheel spin via braking and/or decreasing engine torque. Despite the X-Type&#x27;s importance to Jaguar and Ford&#x27;s Premier Automotive Group, extensive engineering development, a different wheelbase and track, body styling and significant testing the X-Type was often described as just a &quot;reshelled Ford Mondeo&quot;.

Although in the end just 19% of the cars origins were shared, much of which were perfectly suited components such as HVAC units hidden from view and which in no way detracted from the X400&#x27;s Jaguar heritage. As Jaguar&#x27;s first compact executive car since the Jaguar Mark 2 of 1959, the X-Type was the last Jaguar styled under the supervision of Geoff Lawson, with Wayne Burgess and Simon Butterworth as principal designers. The four door saloon launched in 2001, and the five door estate followed in January 2004, with production of both ending in July 2009. The estate offered a Cd of 0.32 in standard form and 0.33 in Sport trim.

Engines included either of two V6 petrol engines: 2.5 litre or 3.0 litre. In 2002, an entry level 2.1 litre V6 front wheel drive model was added. All three engines were available with either five- speed automatic or five speed manual gearboxes. The X-Type grille was slightly modified for both the 2004 and 2006 model years. The base petrol engine was a Jaguar tweaked (Ford Duratec V6) derived from the 2.5-litre that served in the Ford Mondeo, and the 3.0-litre V6 is essentially an adaptation of the engine from the Jaguar S-Type and Lincoln LS.

Eventually, the X-Type would become available with front-wheel drive and a 2.1-litre petrol or 2.0 Turbo diesel engine. In July 2009, Jaguar Land Rover announced the end of X-Type production by the end of 2009. Both saloon and estate configurations were manufactured at the Halewood Assembly Facility near Liverpool, renovated at a cost of $450 million.

==Technical==
The X-Type was based on a modified version of the Ford CD132 platform shared with the Ford Mondeo. The X-Type was initially offered as all-wheel drive only and mated to a 2.5 litre and 3.0 litre AJ-V6 petrol engine. One notable addition to AJ-V6 engine design is the use of variable valve timing. The X-Type&#x27;s petrol engine is also set apart by the use of SFI fuel injection, four valves per cylinder and featured fracture split forged powder metal connecting rods, plus a one piece cast camshaft, and has direct acting mechanical bucket (DAMB) tappets.

In 2003, the X-Type was also offered in front-wheel drive with the introduction of Jaguar&#x27;s first four-cylinder diesel engines (based on the Ford Duratorq ZSD unit from the Mondeo and Transit), and with the smaller 2.1 litre petrol V6. The six speed automatic transmission supplied on the later 2.2 litre diesel models includes Jaguar Sequential Shift.

===Equipment===
At the X-Type&#x27;s launch, standard equipment included automatic climate control; leather upholstery; eight-way power driver&#x27;s seat; 70/30 split folding rear seats; Sapele wood interior trim; tilt-and-telescope steering wheel; six-speaker, 120-watt AM/FM/CD stereo; power locks; one-touch power windows; a power tilt-and-slide glass sunroof; automatic headlights; and 16-inch alloy wheels. Later trim configurations would introduce carbon fibre dash panels Alcantara seat surfaces. All interior wood was genuine, manufactured with veneers for the rest of the Jaguar line-up at Browns Lane&#x27;s Veneer Manufacturing Centre, including the door trim pieces on higher models, increasing the development and production costs.

The estate adds a 320-watt premium Alpine sound system, wood-and-leather steering wheel, 10-way power adjustable seats for driver and front-seat passenger, electrochromic mirrors inside and out, rain-sensing windshield wipers, a programmable garage-door opener, message centre and trip computer, Reverse Park Control, and 17-inch alloy wheels.

===Estate===

Introduced in 2004, the X-Type estate was the first Jaguar model designed by Ian Callum. From its saloon counterpart, the design revised 420 tooled parts and 58 stampings for all components rearward of the windscreen, adding 150-pounds.

The design used a tailgate with independently-opening, strut-supported rear window, operable by key fob or dashboard located switch; roof-mounted luggage rails in chrome or black; interior luggage tie-downs; removable luggage cover; cargo net and a cargo compartment under the rear floor with a 12-volt power outlet and below that, storage for a full-size spare tyre. The rear seats could be lowered without removing their headrests, and the cargo compartment offered 16 cubic feet up to the side windows or 24 cubic feet to the headliner, with the rear seats up — or a total of 50 cubic feet with the rear seats folded.

The estate was marketed as the &quot;Sportwagon&quot; in the United States.

===Facelift===

The X-Type facelift debuted at the 2007 Canary Wharf Motorexpo, and went on sale internationally during 2008, with United Kingdom sales from March.

The facelift featured revised front and rear fascias, new door mirrors with integrated turn indicator repeaters, the choice of a 2.2 litre diesel with particulate filter, and a new six speed automatic transmission with Jaguar Sequential Shift. The range continued to offer the 2.0 litre diesel, and two V6 petrol engines; 2.5 and 3.0 litre. In some European markets, the petrol engines were no longer marketed and in the UK the petrol range was gradually trimmed until only a single petrol model remained available for the final model year.

===Special editions===
In 2004, the &quot;Spirit&quot; limited model based on the 2.5 litre V6, featured the &#x27;Sports Collection&#x27; pack with new spoilers and rear valance. It was followed in 2005 by the &quot;XS&quot; limited edition, which continued the sports theme, but available with a wider range of engines.

==Safety and security==
Euro NCAP&#x27;s crash test found that the doors could still be opened after a frontal impact and that the car offered good protection for children sat in the back during crashes, however they also found that the airbag failed to prevent the driver&#x27;s head from hitting the steering wheel and described its pedestrian impact performance as &quot;dire&quot;, noting that seventeen of the eighteen impact locations they tested on the car offered no protection for a pedestrian from injury.


The X-Type was tested by Thatcham&#x27;s New Vehicle Security Ratings (NVSR) organisation.
==Sales and reception==
In November 2000, managing director Jonathan Browning said Jaguar&#x27;s objective was to achieve annual sales of 100,000 with the car, partly by taking market share from established German rivals and partly by expanding the market segment in Jaguar&#x27;s key markets. The X-Type was Jaguar&#x27;s best selling model during almost all its production run, but sales did not meet projections, peaking at 50,000 in 2003. In the United States, the car&#x27;s primary market, sales dropped from 21,542 in 2004 to 10,941 in 2005. In the same year, Audi sold 48,922 A4s, BMW sold 106,950 3 Series, and Mercedes-Benz sold 60,658 C-Class.

The X-Type&#x27;s sharing of a modified Ford Mondeo platform, which was shared with the Land Rover Freelander, a small offroader that was also produced at Halewood, was not well received by Jaguar purists. Notably, the Volkswagen Passat shared its platform with its compact executive class rival, the B5 Audi A4. The X-Type&#x27;s limited powertrain choices affected its initial press reception. Initially, the X-Type was only available with six cylinder petrol engines, coupled to an all-wheel drive system, resulting in poor fuel economy, while its key German rivals, the BMW 3 Series, Audi A4, and Mercedes C-Class were sold predominantly in two wheel drive form, with four cylinder petrol or diesel engines, a critical offering in the economy conscious European market. A four-cylinder diesel option (only available with front wheel drive) was not offered in the X-Type until two years after its launch.

Jeremy Clarkson, then of BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top Gear,&quot; lauded the X-Type, especially the 4x4 and sport versions. In two episodes, he demonstrated its capabilities in the snow, declaring that it &quot;laughs in the face of the weatherman, the police and the AA, with their advice to stay at home&quot;. With regards to the sharing of the Ford Mondeo platform, Clarkson states that this should not put you off, stating that &quot;genetically you are 98% identical to a halibut, but it&#x27;s the 2% that makes the difference&quot;.

Other car magazine and website reviews were largely positive for the X-Type, especially during its introduction. The X-Type used only 19% of Ford Mondeo&#x27;s components, while a variety of Ford platforms, engines and components were being used by all models of the Ford Motor Company&#x27;s luxury brands in that period, namely Aston Martin, Jaguar and Lincoln. In January 2008, Jaguar director of design Ian Callum said that the X-Type &quot;was essentially designed in Detroit and presented as close as a &quot;fait accompli&quot; to reluctant designers and engineers at Jaguar&#x27;s Whitley design centre.&quot;

Noted automotive designer Robert Cumberford called the X-Type&#x27;s styling &quot;an unimaginable pastiche of many past Jaguars&quot; in the June 2001 issue of Car and Driver magazine. Overall, due to poor sales, Jaguar lost €4,690 per vehicle produced.

==Reviews==
* The AA &lt;br&gt;Likes: Elegant yet contemporary looks, silky smooth driving experience, petrol engines provide suitable soundtrack, high specification level as standard.&lt;br&gt;Gripes: Non AWD models less fun to drive, smallish load area with all seats in place, rear seats do not fold completely flat, body-coloured grilles of Sport models spoil looks.
* &quot;Auto Express&quot; &lt;br&gt;&#x27;Ride, handling and grip are good, finding a fine balance between comfort and sporting ability, cabin is unmistakably Jaguar.&#x27;&lt;br&gt;&#x27;Traditional look and feel ... it&#x27;s not the most spacious car in its class.&#x27;
* &quot;Auto Trader&quot; &lt;br&gt;&#x27;The Jaguar X-Type is the only luxury saloon in its class, according to its makers. And while owners of bona fide luxury cars may scoff, the X-Type has all the right ingredients: heritage, comfort and sartorial elegance.&#x27;
* &quot;CAR&quot; &lt;br&gt;&#x27;A bit of traditional Jag dynamic sensations and half-decent value will tempt some, but no amount of exterior tweaking can hide why the X-type missed its target.&#x27;
* Driving &lt;br&gt;Good - Tempting prices, comfort &amp; kit levels, dynamics.&lt;br&gt;Not So Good - High running costs of petrol models, patchy reliability, old-fashioned styling.
* Honest John &lt;br&gt;Positives: Compact Jaguar, smart looks and roomy load bay, V6s are four-wheel drive, diesels are quite frugal.&lt;br&gt;Negatives: Not recommended for towing, uneven tyre wear on AWD V6 cars.
* &quot;Parker&#x27;s&quot; &lt;br&gt;Pros: Very comfortable and refined, sophisticated image, decent handling, decent boot space, good long distance cruiser.&lt;br&gt;Cons: Traditional styling, cramped rear space, limited engine range, some cheap interior trim.
* RAC &lt;br&gt;&#x27;This is a car that has layers, textures and subtleties to its talents, a Jaguar that needs no preamble. It&#x27;s up there with the best in the class. Just don&#x27;t expect a bargain.&#x27;
* Verdict On Cars &lt;br&gt;&#x27;Average. Jag&#x27;s supposed rival to the BMW 3 Series and Mercedes C-Class is fading fast. It&#x27;s still a good car, but doubts as to whether it deserves the badge are growing.&#x27;
* &quot;What Car?&quot; &lt;br&gt;&#x27;Low prices and a good drive make it a real alternative to a BMW 3 Series. [The Estate] drives just as well as the saloon version, but gives more practicality.&#x27;
* Wise Buyer&#x27;s &lt;br&gt;&#x27;X-Type is sporty to drive and very comfortable, plus it has that charismatic Jaguar badge. But it&#x27;s up against some fine executive cars. It majors on value for money and performance.&#x27;
* &quot;Time&quot; magazine (unrated)&lt;br&gt;&#x27;[I]n its attempt to turn the front-drive compact car into an “all-wheel drive” sports sedan, Jaguar ran smack into the limits of platform engineering. The result was the English version of the Cadillac Cimarron, a tarted-up insult to a once-proud marque and a financial disaster for the company.&#x27;

===Awards===
The Jaguar X-Type won &quot;AutoWeek&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Editors Choice Award&quot; as the &quot;Most Significant Car&quot; at the Geneva Motor Show of 2001.

==Replacement==

In January 2011, Jaguar said plans for successor for the X-Type were under consideration, to compete with models such as the BMW 3 Series, and to be positioned below the current XF.

The project, codenamed &quot;X760&quot;, was set to be launched in 2015. In March 2014, Jaguar confirmed that the X-Type&#x27;s replacement would be named the Jaguar XE.

<text>Richard Beecroft Allan, Baron Allan of Hallam (born 11 February 1966) is a British politician. He was the Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament for Sheffield Hallam from 1997 to 2005.

He was made a life peer in the 2010 Dissolution Honours.

==Early life==
Allan was born in Sheffield. He went to the independent Oundle School in north-east Northamptonshire. He studied at Pembroke College, Cambridge, and gained a BA in Archaeology and Anthropology in 1988. From Bristol Polytechnic, he gained an MSc in Information Technology in 1990. He was a field archaeologist in Britain, France and the Netherlands in 1984–85, and in Ecuador in 1988–89. He was a computer manager at Avon FHSA in 1991–1997.

==Parliamentary career==
In 1997, Allan unseated Irvine Patnick of the Conservative Party achieving a majority of 8,221 with a swing of 15.3%. He was only the second non-Conservative to win Sheffield Hallam, and the first since 1918. In 2001, he was re-elected with an increased majority of 9,347. During his tenure, Allan held various committee seats, including the Chair of the House of Commons Information Select Committee and a seat on the House of Commons Liaison Select Committee. Richard Allan was the founding chairman of the Parthenon 2004 campaign for the return of the Parthenon Marbles.

Allan did not seek reelection at the 2005 general election. He was succeeded by future Lib Dem leader and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, for whom he acted as campaign manager.

On 22 July 2010, he was created a life peer as Baron Allan of Hallam, of Ecclesall in the county of South Yorkshire, and was introduced in the House of Lords on 26 July 2010, where he sits as a Liberal Democrat peer.

==Post political career==
From June 2009 to September 2019 Allan was employed by Facebook as Director of Policy in Europe, responsible for representing the company and lobbying EU governments on matters of concern to it. He was previously Head of Government Affairs for Cisco Systems UK. Allan has given various interviews responding to media concerns about Facebook, and in January 2012 he gave evidence to the Leveson Inquiry on Facebook&#x27;s attitude to malicious posting and to privacy.

He is a visiting fellow of the Oxford Internet Institute and deputy chairman of the British Committee for the Reunification of the Parthenon Marbles.

<text>The British Geophysical Association (BGA) is a joint association of the Royal Astronomical Society and the Geological Society of London, which advances the interests of geophysics and geophysicists within the UK. It aims to promote the subject of geophysics and strengthen the ties between the geological and geophysical communities within the UK by holding meetings and courses, by encouraging the publication geophysical research, and by such other means as are deemed appropriate to an Association by its parent societies.

Membership of the society is open to fellows of either the Royal Astronomical Society or The Geological Society who inform their respective membership secretaries of their interest in geophysics. Following this, fellows will automatically be considered to be members of the BGA with no subscription required.

The BGA is managed by a committee of up to eighteen members with eight directly elected members including a president, secretary, meetings secretary, and treasurer. The committee also includes one member appointed by each of the parent societies, to ensure adequate communication between themselves and the BGA. A school and industry representative may also be co-opted onto the committee, neither of whom needs to be a fellow of either society. The committee had in the past included members from five affiliated groups (Education, Environmental and Industrial Geophysics, Geodesy, Geomagnetism and Palaeomagnetism, Seismology and Physics of the Earth’s Interior), however leading up to the 2009 AGM these positions have been removed and an Education Secretary position created. The committee vote when awarding the prestigious Bullerwell Lecture prize each year.

== 2006 Geophysics Education Review ==

In July 2006 BGA published a review of geophysics education in the UK. In the report it noted that:

The paper predicted that, at current rates, there would be no undergraduates by 2030. As such the review was undertaken with the aims of properly assessing the current state of geophysical education within the UK and consequently identifying problems and recommending further action to take.

Ultimately the paper concluded that there is a need to increase awareness of geophysics in post-16 education environments by including geophysics topics in secondary school examinations. It also suggested that there is an urgent need to develop geophysics courses for physics teachers, such as the Teacher Scientist Network at the Norwich Research Park and the &quot;Seismology in Schools&quot; project.

<doc id="413975" wikidata="Q4935679" url="?curid=413975" title="Janet Anderson">
<text>Janet Anderson (6 December 1949 – 6 February 2023) was a British politician from the Labour Party. She was Member of Parliament (MP) for Rossendale and Darwen from 1992 until 2010, when she lost her seat. She was the Minister for Tourism from 1998 to 2001, a period which included the 2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak. In the 2009 United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal, she was found to have claimed costs for journeys she had not made.

==Early life and education==
Anderson was born in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1949. Her father, Tom Anderson, was an agent for the Labour Party; her mother was an organist in their local Methodist church. She was educated at Trowbridge Girls&#x27; High School (now The John of Gaunt School) and the Kingswood Grammar School in Kingswood, South Gloucestershire. She attended the Polytechnic of Central London and the Université de Nantes, and studied languages and business studies.

== Career ==
In 1971, Anderson joined the offices of &quot;The Scotsman&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; as a secretary. In 1974, she became the personal assistant to the MP for Blackburn, Barbara Castle, and to her successor Jack Straw until the 1987 General Election, when she unsuccessfully fought the marginal seat of Rossendale and Darwen, losing to David Trippier by 4,982 votes.

Anderson became a campaigns organiser for the Parliamentary Labour Party, and then the northern regional organiser for the Shopping Hours Reform Council, campaigning to extend the Sunday trading laws. She also ran her own public relations company, with clients such as the Royal College of Nursing and Safeway plc.

=== Parliamentary career ===
Anderson fought Rossendale and Darwen successfully at the 1992 General Election, winning by just 120 votes. She became the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Margaret Beckett, which she held for a year before resigning due to Beckett not supporting John Smith&#x27;s &#x27;One member, one vote&#x27; campaign.

She was an opposition whip from 1994 to 1996, before being appointed Shadow Minister for Women. In October 1996, while in this role, she joked in an interview that women would become &quot;more promiscuous&quot; under a Labour Government. Anderson later insisted that she did not mean it literally, and that her comment was intended to convey that women would have the &quot;freedom to stay at home or have a career...it wasn&#x27;t about sex or promiscuity.&quot;

In May 1996, in response to campaigns to deal with the problem of stalking, she presented the Stalking Bill 1996 to Parliament under the Ten Minute Rule, with support from 64 other MPs. The bill failed to get government support, as it was felt that the proposed offence failed to distinguish between reasonable and unreasonable conduct.

Following the 1997 General Election, Anderson became a junior whip, and Vice-Chamberlain of the Household in Tony Blair&#x27;s new government, before being promoted to Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport in 1998, where she was the Minister for Tourism, Film and Broadcasting, and was responsible for bringing in free television licences for the over 75s and discounted ones for the blind.

During her time as Minister for Tourism, rural tourism lost £100m a week at the height of the foot and mouth crisis. Prior to the release of the 1999 James Bond film &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;, when MI6 tried to block filming around the exterior of their Headquarters, Anderson successfully appealed to the Foreign Secretary, who overruled them and allowed filming to commence.

At the conclusion of the foot and mouth crisis, Anderson returned to the back benches following the 2001 General Election. She subsequently served on the Home Affairs Select Committee, before becoming a member of the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee and the House of Commons Administration Committee. She was also on the Chairmen&#x27;s Panel Committee, and was a member, and later the chair, of the All-Party Parliamentary Writers&#x27; Group.

She was defeated in the 2010 General Election, by Conservative candidate Jake Berry in an 8.9% swing to the Conservatives. Berry overturned a Labour majority of 3,616 to win by 4,493 votes.

=== Book ===
While serving as junior whip and Chamberlain of the Household under Tony Blair, Anderson was responsible for sending daily reports to the Palace about daily business in Parliament. She decided to &quot;spice up&quot; her accounts of each day&#x27;s debates by injecting them with Westminster gossip. Anderson later published her letters, which were reportedly well appreciated by the Queen, in a book titled &quot;Dear Queen&quot;.

===Expenses===
In May 2009, during the disclosure of expenses of British members of parliament over MPs&#x27; expenses, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; alleged that Anderson had submitted and was paid a claim form including mileage equalling five round trips to her constituency each week parliament despite living in London during the week. Her expenses for car journeys were £16,612 for 60,118 miles travelled. This was £4,500 more than the next highest claimant, Laurence Robertson.

&quot;The Telegraph&quot; described her as &quot;one of the most prolific expense claimers in Parliament&quot;.

Other allegations included expenses for the upkeep of the home of her partner, fellow MP Jim Dowd MP, in his Lewisham constituency under her second home allowance despite Dowd claiming the London salary supplement intended to cover the additional cost of living in London. Anderson was one of 98 MPs who voted in favour of legislation which would have kept MPs expense information undisclosed.

Anderson claimed near the maximum Additional Costs Allowance between 2001 and 2008, ranking joint highest in 2002/03, 2004/05 and 2006/07 also 3rd in 2003/04. In January 2010, Anderson was allowed to repay £5,750 in expenses for over-claimed petty cash.

==Personal life and death==
Anderson married solicitor Vincent Humphreys in 1972; the couple had three children, daughters Kate and Dee and son, James. In 1998, she left, later divorcing Humphreys for her fellow Labour MP Jim Dowd, though she remained on good terms with her former husband. She married Dowd in 2016. She spoke fluent French.

Anderson died on 6 February 2023, at the age of 73.

<doc id="413976" wikidata="Q304388" url="?curid=413976" title="Frank Field, Baron Field of Birkenhead">
<text>Frank Ernest Field, Baron Field of Birkenhead, (16 July 1942 – 23 April 2024) was a British politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Birkenhead for 40 years, from 1979 to 2019, serving as a Labour MP until 2018 and thereafter sitting as an independent. In 2019, he formed the Birkenhead Social Justice Party and stood unsuccessfully as its sole candidate in the 2019 election. After leaving the House of Commons, he was awarded a life peerage in 2020 and sat in the House of Lords as a crossbencher.

From 1997 to 1998, Field served as Minister of Welfare Reform in Tony Blair&#x27;s first government. Field resigned following differences with Blair; as a backbencher, he soon became one of the Labour government&#x27;s most vocal critics.

Field was elected chair of the Work and Pensions Select Committee in 2015, and was re-elected unopposed following the 2017 general election.

In 2018, Field resigned the Labour whip citing antisemitism in the party, as well as a &quot;culture of intolerance, nastiness and intimidation&quot; in parts of the party, including in his own constituency. Field lost a confidence vote in his constituency party a month before his resignation, after siding with the government in Brexit votes. His resignation of the whip also led to his departure from the wider membership of the Labour Party, according to the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party, although Field disputed this.

== Early life ==
Field was born in Edmonton, Middlesex, on 16 July 1942, the second of three sons. His father was a labourer at the Morgan Crucible Company&#x27;s factory in Battersea and his mother a primary school welfare worker at Belmont Primary School in Chiswick. His parents were Conservatives &quot;who believed in character and pulling oneself up by one&#x27;s own bootstraps&quot;.

Field was educated at St Clement Danes Grammar School, at that time in Hammersmith, before studying Economics at the University of Hull. In his youth he was a member of the Conservative Party, but left in 1960 because of his opposition to apartheid in South Africa and joined the Labour Party. In 1964, he became a further education teacher in Southwark and Hammersmith.

Field served as a Labour councillor for Turnham Green on Hounslow London Borough Council from 1964 until 1968, when he lost his seat. He was Director of the Child Poverty Action Group from 1969 to 1979, employing Virginia Bottomley (now Baroness Bottomley of Nettlestone) on long-term research into income and expenditure for families below the poverty line, and the Low Pay Unit from 1974 to 1980.

== Political career ==
Field unsuccessfully contested the constituency of South Buckinghamshire at the 1966 general election, where he was defeated by the sitting Conservative MP Ronald Bell. He was selected to contest the safe Labour seat of Birkenhead at the 1979 general election on the retirement of the sitting MP Edmund Dell. Field held the seat with a majority of 5,909 and remained the constituency&#x27;s MP until November 2019.

In Parliament, Field was made a member of the Opposition frontbench by the Labour leader Michael Foot as a spokesman on Education in 1980, but was dropped a year later. Following the appointment of Neil Kinnock as the Labour leader in 1983, Field was appointed as a spokesman on Health and Social Security for a year. He was appointed the chairman of the Social Services Select Committee in 1987, becoming the chairman of the new Social Security Select Committee in 1990, a position he held until the 1997 election.

Two nights before the Conservative leadership election in November 1990, he visited Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher at 10 Downing Street. He advised her that her time as prime minister was drawing to a close and that she should back John Major to take over the role. His reason for doing so was that he felt her Conservative colleagues would not tell her straight that she could not win a leadership contest. Following this meeting, he was smuggled out of Downing Street&#x27;s back door. Two days later Thatcher supported John Major for the post and Major became prime minister.

=== Minister for Welfare Reform ===
Following the 1997 election, with Labour now in power, Field joined the government led by Tony Blair as its Minister for Welfare Reform, working in the Department of Social Security (DSS). Blair has said Field&#x27;s mission was to &quot;think the unthinkable&quot;.

Field thought that the state should play only a small direct role in the provision of welfare and he disliked means-testing and non-contributory entitlement to benefits, which he believed should only be received after claimants had joined Continental-style social insurance schemes or mutual organisations such as friendly societies. There were clashes with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, and the Secretary of State for Social Security, Harriet Harman – the Treasury was concerned about costs, while Brown himself was in favour of the poor being entitled to working-age benefits without having first paid National Insurance contributions, later established as the Working Families Tax Credit. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Field resigned his ministerial position in July 1998 rather than accept a move away from the DSS as part of a wider reshuffle; the newspaper suggested at the time that Blair had been &quot;disappointed&quot; by Field&#x27;s ideas for welfare reform. Harriet Harman also returned to the backbenches. In his autobiography, Blair wrote about Field:

The following year, Downing Street briefed the press that &quot;harsh and authoritarian&quot; measures were in store for welfare recipients and plans were made to abolish the DSS.

At the end of Blair&#x27;s second term of office, the BBC reviewed his record on welfare reform up to that point:

The welfare reform most closely associated with Blair was not introduced for a further three years: the replacement of Incapacity Benefit (IB) by Employment and Support Allowance (ESA). The think-tank Reform, on whose advisory board Field used to sit, said in its 2016 report on changes to out-of-work sickness benefits that ESA had &quot;replicated many of the problems of IB&quot; and had therefore &quot;failed to achieve its objective&quot;.

=== Return to the backbenches ===
After leaving ministerial office, Field continued with his duties as an MP and joined the Ecclesiastical and the Public Accounts Select Committees in the House of Commons.

From the backbenches, he was a vocal critic of the government, criticising in 1999 the new Working Families Tax Credit as an approach which could not survive in the long term, and voting against foundation hospitals in November 2003. In May 2008, he was a significant critic of the abolition of the 10p tax rate and this led to Field describing Prime Minister Gordon Brown as &quot;unhappy inside his own body&quot;. He later apologised in parliament for the personal attack. In June 2008, Field joined calls for the establishment of a devolved parliament for England.

On 8 June 2009, Field wrote in his blog that he believed that the Labour Party would not win the next election with Gordon Brown as leader. On 6 January 2010, Field was one of the few Labour MPs to back Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt&#x27;s calls for a secret ballot of the Parliamentary Labour Party on the leadership of Gordon Brown. The ballot could have led to a leadership contest.

In May 2009, Field announced his candidature for Speaker of the House of Commons, but later withdrew his candidature, citing lack of support from within his own party. John Bercow was elected as the new Speaker.

In the 2010 general election Field retained his Birkenhead seat with an increased majority. In June 2010 he was appointed by David Cameron&#x27;s coalition government to head an independent review into poverty, which proposed adopting a new measure centred around life-chance indicators and increasing funding for early years education. In an interview in September 2012, Field considered the government to have ignored his report, saying &quot;nothing had been done about it&quot; and that it was &quot;very disappointing&quot;.

In October 2013, along with Laura Sandys, Field established the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Hunger and Food Poverty, which he went on to chair. He also chaired a parliamentary inquiry into hunger commissioned by the APPG which reported in December 2014. Field became the chair of trustees of Feeding Britain, a charitable organisation set up in October 2015 to implement the recommendations made by the APPG.

Following the 2015 general election, it was announced in June 2015 that he had been elected to the chairmanship of the Work and Pensions Select Committee. He was re-elected unopposed to the role following the 2017 general election.

Field nominated Jeremy Corbyn as a candidate in the Labour leadership election of 2015, stating that while he did not think Corbyn could win a general election, he hoped his candidature would force the party to confront its &#x27;deficit denial&#x27;.

In June 2016, Field wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that he supported Brexit, emphasising the need to control immigration due to it creating excessive demands on public services, roads and housing stock. He argued the EU model suited big businesses who wanted cheap labour, and supported agricultural interests creating high prices for food, rather than families. The &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot; reported that Field was &quot;a long-time Brexiteer&quot;.

In December 2017, during a debate on Universal Credit, Field described the impact that Universal Credit changes had had on his constituents. His observations moved Work and Pensions Select Committee member Heidi Allen to tears. Field spoke of how he had talked a man out of suicide and how one claimant felt &quot;lucky&quot; his family was invited to eat food leftovers from a funeral.

=== Resignation of the Labour whip ===
On 17 July 2018, a vote was held on a rebel amendment to a trade bill, which aimed to force the British government to join a customs union with the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Field, Kate Hoey, John Mann and Graham Stringer were the only Labour MPs to oppose the amendment, which was lost by 307 votes to 301. Field lost a confidence vote in his constituency, after siding with the government in these Brexit votes. On 30 August 2018, Field resigned the Labour whip because, he said, Labour was &quot;increasingly seen as a racist party&quot; and due to the &quot;culture of intolerance, nastiness and intimidation&quot; in parts of the party, including his own constituency. Some commentators suggested that he had &quot;jumped before he was pushed&quot;.

Field described himself as an &quot;independent Labour MP&quot;. In September 2018, he said he would not trigger a by-election and would remain an MP. On 2 August 2019, he announced that he was forming a new party, the Birkenhead Social Justice Party.

Field voted for Prime Minister Theresa May&#x27;s Brexit deal in the &quot;meaningful vote&quot; on 15 January 2019, which May lost. Subsequently, Field voted for the Conservative Party-supported Brady amendment calling on the Government to renegotiate the Northern Ireland backstop part of the deal and abstained on the Labour party-supported Cooper-Boles amendment to prevent a no-deal Brexit.

=== Birkenhead Social Justice Party ===
In August 2019, Field stated that he would stand in the next general election as a candidate for a newly-formed Birkenhead Social Justice Party. The party stated that it would stand on a social justice, localist and pro-Brexit platform.

In the December 2019 general election, he was beaten by the Labour Party candidate Mick Whitley, who polled 24,990 votes, compared to Field&#x27;s 7,285, a winning margin of 17,705 votes. The Party was de-registered with the Electoral Commission on 17 February 2020.

== Awards and honours ==
Field was sworn in as a member of the Privy Council in 1997. This gave him the honorific prefix &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; and, after ennoblement, the post nominal letters &quot;PC&quot; for life.

He was appointed as a deputy lieutenant for the county of Merseyside in October 2011. At the age of 75 he was moved to the retired list. This gave him the Post Nominal Letters &quot;DL&quot; for Life.

In March 2015, Field was awarded the Grassroot Diplomat initiative honour for the co-founding of environmental organisation Cool Earth, a charity that works alongside indigenous villages to halt rainforest destruction as a bottom-up solution to an ageing problem.

Field was awarded an honorary fellowship by Liverpool John Moores University on 12 July 2016.

In 2017, he was awarded the Langton Award for Community Service by the Archbishop of Canterbury &quot;for sustained and outstanding commitment to social welfare&quot;.
Field was nominated for a life peerage in the 2019 Dissolution Honours. He was created Baron Field of Birkenhead, &quot;of Birkenhead in the County of Merseyside&quot;, on 11 September 2020.

Field was appointed Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in the 2022 New Year Honours for political and public service. Field was awarded the freedom of the Borough of Wirral on 16 February 2022. He was also a Companion of the Guild of St George.

== Personal beliefs ==
Field had a reputation for being an intellectual, a free-thinker and a maverick in the Parliamentary Labour Party. Inspired by his Christianity, he took a socially conservative stance on various issues particularly on the family, antisocial behaviour, immigration and welfare reform. He also embraced calls for an English Parliament and called for a renegotiation of Britain&#x27;s relationship with European Union, including changes to free movement of labour. He voted for gay marriage and in favour of other gay rights legislation since 1997. He was a member of the advisory board of Reform and of the generally conservative but also &quot;broad church&quot; magazine &quot;Standpoint&quot;. In May 2008, he said that Margaret Thatcher &quot;is certainly a hero&quot; and that &quot;I still see Mrs T from time to time – I always call her &#x27;Mrs T&#x27;, when I talk to her&quot;. He regarded Thatcher as a friend and believed in her self-help market philosophy.

In 1999, based on his belief that Britain should find a sustainable non-political way to fund retirement, Field helped set up the Pension Reform Group, which promotes the Universal Protected Pension as the best means to reform pensions.

Although there were attempts to get him to defect to the Conservatives, they were without success. In 2008, Field was named as the 100th-most-influential right-winger in the United Kingdom by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. Field supported the return of national service to tackle growing unemployment and instil &quot;a sense of order and patriotism&quot; in Britain&#x27;s young men and women. In May 2010, Field endorsed Ed Miliband to become leader of the Labour Party to replace Gordon Brown.

Field believed strongly in fighting climate change. He co-founded the charity Cool Earth with Johan Eliasch. Cool Earth protects endangered rainforest and works with the local communities to combat climate change. Field was the instigator of the idea of a global Commonwealth network of protected forests, though he failed to raise political interest for a number of years; according to Field, when Queen Elizabeth II was told about the idea, she supported it enthusiastically, and the initiative was launched as The Queen&#x27;s Commonwealth Canopy in 2015.

In 2010 he chaired the Liverpool City Region Poverty and Life Chances Commission to create a new strategy for the Government to abolish child poverty.

Field believed in reducing the time-limit within which women can have an abortion, and in stripping abortion providers such as Marie Stopes of their counselling role and handing it to organisations not linked to abortion clinics. With the Conservative MP Nadine Dorries, he was vocal in two defeated attempts to legislate for such a reform in Parliament. He was a prominent Eurosceptic within the Labour Party and declared on 20 February 2016 that he would campaign to leave the EU. In January 2019, the supporters page of the Labour Leave website listed only two MPs, Labour&#x27;s Kate Hoey and Field.

==Personal life==
Field was an active member of the Church of England, a former chairman of the Churches Conservation Trust and a member of the Church of England General Synod. In 1983, while a member of General Synod, Frank responded to the plight of a number of divorced clergy wives and helped them found Broken Rites, a self help organisation that supports separated and divorced clergy spouses and civil partners and also lobbies for fair treatment for them. [www.brokenrites.org] Field&#x27;s political and religious views were most clearly expressed in his book &quot;Neighbours From Hell&quot; where he discusses what might replace the &quot;largely beneficial effect&quot; of evangelical Christianity. Between 2005 and 2015, Field was chairman of the Cathedral Fabrics Commission for England – the national body that controls the care, conservation and repair or development of cathedrals. In 2007 he was appointed chairman of the 2011 King James Bible Trust, which was established to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the King James Bible.

Field was also a Vice President of the National Churches Trust.

In a 2006 article in &quot;The Observer&quot;, the critic Jay Rayner noted that Field&#x27;s unmarried status had led him to describe himself as &quot;incomplete&quot; but that those in his social circle suggested he enjoyed &quot;a full life outside politics&quot;. From 1979 he lived in a postwar block half a mile from the House of Commons. In February 2023, his book &quot;Politics, Poverty and Belief&quot; was published, co-written with Brian Griffiths, Thatcher&#x27;s former chief policy adviser, and Rachel Griffiths.

=== Illness and death ===
Field was admitted to hospital after collapsing during a meeting in March 2015.

On 22 October 2021, Field announced that he was terminally ill and had spent time in a hospice. Baroness Meacher read out a statement from him in the House of Lords during a debate on the Assisted Dying Bill, which he supported.

In a January 2023 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Field revealed he had been suffering from prostate cancer for ten years and it had spread to his jaw. He remarked: &quot;It&#x27;s a strange experience taking so long to die.&quot;

<text>This is a list of people executed in Kentucky. Since the reinstatement of capital punishment in the United States in 1976, three people have been executed in Kentucky. All three were executed for murder. All of the executions occurred at the Kentucky State Penitentiary (KSP) in Eddyville.

As of 2024, Harold McQueen has been the only person executed by the Commonwealth of Kentucky involuntarily since 1976. Edward Lee Harper and Marco Allen Chapman both volunteered to be executed. Harper dropped his remaining appeals while Chapman waived all non-statutory appeals during initial sentencing. (According to the Kentucky Revised Statutes, all sentences of death in Kentucky must be reviewed and affirmed by the Kentucky Supreme Court before they are carried out.)

Another execution of note in Kentucky was that of Rainey Bethea. Bethea was executed by hanging on 14 August 1936 for the rape of 70-year-old Lischia Edwards. He had also confessed to her murder by strangling but the Commonwealth indicted him only on the rape charge since that was the only capital crime for which the penalty was public hanging. Had Bethea been convicted and sentenced to death for murder (even with an additional rape conviction), the law as it was written at the time would have required Bethea to have been transported to Eddyville and executed in KSP&#x27;s electric chair. It was to be the last public hanging in the United States; the execution was witnessed by thousands in downtown Owensboro.

The first person legally executed by the state of Kentucky was Jereboam O. Beauchamp who was hanged in 1826 for the murder of Solomon P. Sharp.

<text>[[Capital punishment]] is one of two possible penalties for aggravated murder in the U.S. state of [[Oregon]], with it being required by the Constitution of Oregon.

In November 2011, Governor John Kitzhaber announced a moratorium on executions in Oregon, canceling a planned execution and ordering a review of the death penalty system in the state. Kitzhaber&#x27;s successor, Governor Kate Brown, affirmed her commitment to the moratorium, and furthermore commuted all death sentences in December 2022, emptying the state&#x27;s death row; her successor, Tina Kotek, has continued the moratorium.

Oregon no longer allows for non-unanimous juries in felony cases, and all felony (including capital) cases in Oregon require a unanimous jury verdict.

In case of a hung jury during the penalty phase of the trial, a life sentence is issued, even if a single juror opposed death (there is no retrial).

The governor of Oregon has sole authority over clemency, including capital cases.

Executions are carried out by lethal injection in Oregon.

The men&#x27;s death row is located, and executions are carried out, at the Oregon State Penitentiary in Salem. Women on death row are held at Coffee Creek Correctional Facility until shortly before their execution.

== Early history ==
The first death sentence carried out under the territorial government, apart from the hanging of the 5 Cayuse in 1850, came on April 18, 1851, when William Kendall was hanged in Salem. Kendall&#x27;s sentence was handed down by Judge William Strong of the Oregon Supreme Court. Five Cayuse Native American men were taken to Oregon City, tried and sentenced to hang. Before their execution on June 3, 1850, the leader, Tiloukaikt, accepted Catholic last rites. Tiloukaikt spoke on the gallows, &quot;Did not your missionaries teach us that Christ died to save his people? So we die to save our people.&quot;

Capital punishment was made explicitly legal by statute in 1864, and executions have been carried out exclusively at the Oregon State Penitentiary in Salem since 1904. The death penalty was outlawed between 1914 and 1920, again between 1964 and 1978, and then again between a 1981 Oregon Supreme Court ruling and a 1984 ballot measure.

Oregon voters amended the Constitution in 1914, to repeal the death penalty, by a margin of 50.04%. The repeal was an initiative of Governor Oswald West. However, the death penalty was restored in 1920 with 56% of voters favoring its use. From 1864 to 1931, executions were carried out by hanging. However, beginning with the execution of LeRoy Hershel McCarthy, on January 30, 1939, Oregon began using lethal gas in gas chamber executions. The state executed seventeen men in this manner, including Robert E. Lee Folkes. The last of these gas-inhalation executions took place on 20 August 1962, with the execution of Leroy McGahuey. In 1964 voters passed Measure 1, a constitutional amendment prohibiting capital punishment, with 60% of voters approving. Governor Mark Hatfield commuted the sentences of three death row inmates two days later.

== Reinstatement ==
Voters reenacted the death penalty in the general election of 1978, by statute; Measure 8 required the death penalty in certain murder cases. Measure 8 was overturned by the Oregon Supreme Court in 1981, on the grounds that it denied defendants the right to be tried by a jury of their peers.

In 1984, Measure 6 amended the state constitution to once more make the death penalty legal. Measure 7, a statutory measure passed in the same year, required a separate sentencing hearing before a jury in cases of aggravated murder.

In 1988, the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Penry v. Lynaugh&quot; affected the Oregon death penalty, because Oregon&#x27;s law is based on the Texas law involved in the case. Seventeen Oregon cases were remanded for resentencing following &quot;Penry&quot;; eight of those convicts were re-sentenced to death.

In 2000, the Benetton Group featured several inmates on Oregon&#x27;s death row in a controversial anti-death penalty advertising campaign. Cesar Barone, Conan Wayne Hale, Jesse Caleb Compton, and Alberto Reyes Camarena were featured in the ad.

Between 1904 and 1994, 115 people were sentenced to death in Oregon, and 58 of those were executed.

In response to Governor Kitzhaber 2011 moratorium, death row inmate Gary Haugen sued the Governor, claiming he had the right to be executed, and seeking the Court to order Kitzhaber to carry out the execution. In June 2013, the Oregon Supreme Court ruled in the case &quot;Haugen v. Kitzhaber&quot; that Haugen had no legal right to be executed, and that Kitzhaber&#x27;s reprieve of Haugen&#x27;s execution did not require Haugen&#x27;s agreement to be effective.

On December 13, 2022, Governor Kate Brown announced that she would commute the sentences of all 17 death row inmates, effective December 14, 2022. She also directed the Oregon Department of Corrections to dismantle Oregon&#x27;s lethal injection death chamber. Governor Brown&#x27;s successor, Tina Kotek, stated her own personal opposition to the death penalty and her intention to continue the moratorium established by her predecessors.

== Executions since 1978 ==
2 people have been executed in Oregon since the reinstatement of capital punishment in 1978. Both waived their appeals and asked that the execution be carried out.

== Capital crimes ==
Aggravated murder is the only crime punishable by death in Oregon. On 1 August 2019, Governor Kate Brown signed a bill that restricts the death penalty to four cases:

(1) acts of terrorism in which two or more people are killed by an organized terrorist group
&lt;br&gt;
(2) premeditated murders of children aged 13 or younger
&lt;br&gt;
(3) prison murders committed by those already incarcerated for aggravated murder
&lt;br&gt;
(4) premeditated murders of police or correctional officers

<doc id="413984" wikidata="Q5386503" url="?curid=413984" title="Eric Forth">
<text>Eric Forth (9 September 1944 – 17 May 2006) was a British Conservative politician. He served as Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for Birmingham North from 1979 to 1984. He then served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Mid Worcestershire from 1983 to 1997. Finally, he served as MP for Bromley and Chislehurst from 1997 until his death in 2006.

Forth served as a junior minister in the governments of Margaret Thatcher and John Major between 1988 and 1997. In his obituaries, he was described as &quot;colourful&quot;, &quot;flamboyant&quot;, &quot;provocative&quot; and a &quot;right-wing libertarian&quot;. He was noted for his colourful ties and waistcoats.

==Early and private life==
Forth was born in Glasgow. His father was a harbourmaster. He was educated at the Jordanhill College School and the University of Glasgow, where he was awarded a master&#x27;s degree in politics and economics. Before entering politics, he worked in junior managerial roles at Xerox, Rank and Ford Motor Company before becoming a management consultant with Deloitte and Dexion.

==Political career==
After standing as a communist at a mock school-election and flirting with distributism at university, Forth developed both conservative and libertarian leanings. Forth was elected as a councillor for the Pilgrims Hatch ward on the Brentwood Urban District Council from 1968 to 1972. He contested the safe Labour seat of Barking at both the February and October 1974 general elections, where on both occasions he was defeated by Labour&#x27;s Jo Richardson. He was the secretary of Llandeilo Conservative Association from 1975 to 1977, and chairman of the Ross-on-Wye Conservative Political Committee from 1978 to 1979.

He was elected to the European Parliament as the member for Birmingham North in 1979. He remained in Brussels and Strasbourg until 1984, where he founded and chaired the backbench committee of the European Democratic Group. Originally in favour of membership of the European Economic Community, he later became a staunch Eurosceptic.

He was elected to the House of Commons at the 1983 general election with a majority of 14,205 votes for the new seat of Mid-Worcestershire. His political views were apparent from his maiden speech, in which he attacked the Sex Equality Bill, and he was an early member of the No Turning Back group. Following boundary changes to his constituency, he was not selected to fight the new seat with the same name, losing out to the sitting MP for Worcester, Peter Luff. Forth found a safe seat in the Outer London suburbs for Bromley and Chislehurst in the heart of the large London Borough of Bromley. He was elected to represent the seat in 1997, 2001 and 2005.

In Parliament, he served on the Employment select committee in 1986 until later in the year when he was appointed as the Parliamentary Private Secretary to Angela Rumbold at the Department for Education and Science. 

He entered the government of Margaret Thatcher when she appointed him as the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department of Trade and Industry in 1988, as minister for consumer affairs. He was moved by John Major in 1990 to the same position at the Department for Employment and at the Department of Education following the 1992 general election. He was promoted to Minister of State for Education in 1994 and became a member of the Privy Council in 1996, shortly before leaving office in 1997.

==The awkward squad==
Forth had hoped to support Michael Portillo for the leadership of the Conservative Party, to follow Major, but Portillo famously lost his seat in the 1997 general election. Forth was then Peter Lilley&#x27;s campaign manager until the latter withdrew, then supported John Redwood, and finally backed eventual winner William Hague. Forth refused the offer of a place in the Conservative shadow ministerial team and instead became a leading backbench irritant to the Labour government, engaging in &quot;a Parliamentary form of guerrilla warfare&quot;. Initially acting as a loner and concentrating on private members bills to which he objected, Forth soon gathered a small group around him known as &quot;the awkward squad&quot;.

In 1997, with senior Conservative MPs David Maclean and Patrick McLoughlin, he established the Policy Research Unit, a subscription briefing service available to any MP as a means of countering the briefings that government ministers receive from the civil service.

Disliking e-mail, he would send brief written notes to like-minded MPs to say &quot;I am given to understand that the Powers That Be think that Wednesday&#x27;s business will go through easily&quot;, and his group would ensure that Wednesday&#x27;s business did not go through easily. Forth&#x27;s speciality was the filibuster: as Labour MPs found themselves often required to remain in Parliament past midnight, they called him &quot;Bloody Eric Forth&quot; (a reaction Forth welcomed). Iain Duncan Smith appointed Forth Shadow Leader of the House of Commons in 2001. Forth backed David Davis to replace Duncan Smith in 2003: Davis refused to stand, and Forth was dismissed from his front-bench position by Michael Howard. He served on many Parliamentary committees and his last role was chairing the statutory instruments committee. He was a member of the speaker&#x27;s Panel of Chairmen.

Forth was in favour of capital punishment, but opposed corporal punishment in schools. After William Hague announced his support for an &quot;election compact&quot; promoted by the Commission for Racial Equality in 2001, Forth was quoted as saying at a private dinner: &quot;All this sucking up to minorities is ridiculous; there are millions of people in this country who are white, Anglo-Saxon and bigoted and they need to be represented.&quot; He opposed the BBC&#x27;s spending money on a Nelson Mandela concert in 1988, saying &quot;those who want the arts and who support them should pay for them themselves&quot;. He also opposed the government spending on AIDS treatment, saying that the disease was &quot;largely self-inflicted&quot;. He was a fan of Elvis Presley and treasurer of the all-party Music Appreciation Group, and a couple of Presley&#x27;s songs were played at Forth&#x27;s memorial service in October 2006.

==Personal life==
Forth was married to Linda St. Clair on 11 March 1967 and they had two daughters before their divorce in 1994; he remarried later that year to Carroll Goff, gaining a stepson. Forth died from cancer at Charing Cross Hospital on 17 May 2006, at the age of 61.

<text>The Billings ovulation method is a method in which women use their vaginal mucus to determine their fertility. It does not rely on the presence of ovulation, but identifies patterns of potential and obvious infertility within the cycle. Its effectiveness is not very clear.

== Evidence ==
Evidence of effectiveness is not very clear. Typical use of this method is associated with a pregnancy rate of 1 to 22%. A World Health Organization study found that 15% is caused by a conscious departure from method rules. The percentage of people who stop using the method after a year is 1–24%. Perfect use has been estimated to result in pregnancy in 0.5–3%. Some studies of perfect use excluded those who could not detect secretions that represented fertility.

==Fertility==
*A woman ovulates at only one time during her cycle, and an unfertilised ovum can survive for only 12–24 hours.
*Cervical mucus enabling healthy sperm cells to navigate the genital tract is necessary for fertility.
*Most commonly, spermatozoa live only one to three days in the presence of fertile mucus, with survival up to five days being rare. The possibility of pregnancy from sperm survival longer than five days has been compared to &quot;the chances of winning a huge lottery.&quot; 
*Menstruation will occur about 2 weeks after ovulation.
*A ten-year study of 45,280 subfertile couples in China found that 32.1% of women were able to achieve pregnancy and live birth through the use of Billings.

==Function==
In the days leading up to ovulation the cervix responds to oestrogen by producing mucus capable of sustaining sperm survival. This mucus leaves the vagina as the woman is in an upright position. The mucus is observed through the sensation at the vulva and by looking at any cervical secretions. Daily charting of these observations will reveal either an unchanging pattern indicating infertility or a changing pattern of sensation and discharge indicating fertility. Both of these patterns follow the hormonal patterns which control sperm survival and conception.

==History==
The first recorded observations of the relationship between cervical mucus and survival of spermatozoa come from the mid-19th century. The topic was not systematically studied, however, for almost another century. In 1948, Erik Odeblad was studying mycoplasms in the female genital tract. During the course of his studies, he noticed that cervical mucus changed in a predictable pattern through the course of a woman&#x27;s cycle. He continued his study of the cervix.

John Billings (1918–2007) was involved with the development of the Billings ovulation method.

<text>Semyon Ivanovich Dezhnyov (, ; sometimes spelled Dezhnev; March 7, 1605 – 1673) was a Russian explorer of Siberia and the first European to sail through the Bering Strait, 80 years before Vitus Bering did. In 1648 he sailed from the Kolyma River on the Arctic Ocean to the Anadyr River on the Pacific. His exploit was forgotten for almost a hundred years and Bering is usually given credit for discovering the strait that bears his name.

==Biography==

Dezhnyov was a Pomor Russian, born in 1605, possibly in the town of Veliky Ustyug or the village of Pinega. According to the anthropologist Lydia T. Black, Dezhnyov was recruited for Siberian service in 1630, possibly as a service man or government agent. He served for eight years in Tobolsk and Yeniseisk, and then went to Yakutia in 1639, or possibly earlier. He is said to have been a member of the Cossack detachment under Beketov, who is credited with founding Yakutsk (on the Lena River) in 1632. In any case, no later than 1639 he was sent to Yakutia, where he married a Yakut captive and spent the next three years collecting (otherwise known as fur tribute) from the natives.

In 1641, Dezhnyov moved northeast to a newly discovered tributary of the Indigirka River where he served under Mikhail Stadukhin. Finding few furs and hostile natives and hearing of a rich river to the east, he, Stadukhin and Yarilo Zyrian sailed down the Indigirka, then east along the coast to the Kolyma River, where they built an ostrog (or fort) (1643). This was at the time the easternmost Russian frontier. The Kolyma soon proved to be one of the richest areas in eastern Siberia. In 1647, 396 men paid head-tax there and 404 men received passports to travel from Yakutsk to the Kolyma.
From about 1642, Russians began hearing of a &#x27;Pogycha River&#x27; to the east which flowed into the Arctic and that the nearby area was rich in sable fur, walrus ivory and silver ore. An attempt to reach it in 1646 failed. In 1647, Fedot Alekseyev, an agent of a Moscow merchant, organized an expedition and brought in Dezhnyov because he was a government official. The expedition reached the sea but was unable to round the Chukchi Peninsula because it had to turn back due to thick drift ice.

They tried again the following year (1648). Fedot Alekseyev was joined by two others, Andreev and Afstaf&#x27;iev, representing the Guselnikov merchant house, with their own vessels and men, while Alekseyev provided five vessels and the majority of the men. Gerasim Ankudinov, with his own vessel and 30 men, also joined the expedition. Dezhnyov recruited his own men, 18 or 19, for fur gathering for private profit, as was the custom at the time. The whole group numbered between 89 and 121 people, travelling in traditional koch vessels. At least one woman, Alekseyev&#x27;s Yakut wife, was with this group.

On 20 June 1648 (old style, 30 June new style), they departed from (most likely) Srednekolymsk and sailed down the river to the Arctic. During the next year it was learned from captives that two koches had been wrecked and their survivors killed by the natives. Two other koches were lost in a way that is not recorded. Some time before 20 September (o.s) they rounded a &#x27;great rocky projection&#x27;. Here Ankudinov&#x27;s koch was wrecked and the survivors were transferred to the remaining two vessels. At the beginning of October a storm blew up and Fedot&#x27;s koch disappeared. In 1653/4, Dezhnyov rescued from the indigenous Koryaks Fedot&#x27;s Yakut woman, who had accompanied him from the Kolyma. She said that Fedot died of scurvy, that several of his companions were killed by the Koryaks, and that the rest had fled in small boats to an unknown fate.

Dezhnyov&#x27;s koch was driven by the storm and was eventually wrecked somewhere south of the Anadyr. The remaining 25 men wandered in unknown country for 10 weeks until they came to the mouth of the Anadyr. Twelve men went up the Anadyr, walked for 20 days, found nothing and turned back. Three of the stronger men got back to Dezhnyov and the rest were never heard of again. In the spring or early summer of 1649 the 12 remaining men built boats from driftwood and went up the Anadyr. They were probably trying to get out of the tundra into forested country to obtain sables and firewood. About 320 miles upriver they built a zimov&#x27;ye (winter quarters) somewhere near Anadyrsk and subjected the local Yukaghirs to tribute.

In 1649, Russians on the Kolyma ascended the Anyuy River branch of the Kolyma and learned that one could travel from its headwaters to the headwaters of the Pogycha-Anadyr. In 1650 Stadukhin and Semyon Motora followed this route and stumbled onto Dezhnyov&#x27;s camp. The land route was clearly superior and Dezhnyov&#x27;s sea route was never used again. Dezhnyov spent the next several years exploring and collecting tribute from the natives. More cossacks arrived from the Kolyma; Motora was killed and Stadukhin went south to find the Penzhina River. Dezhnyov found a walrus rookery at the mouth of the Anadyr and ultimately accumulated over 2 tons of walrus ivory, far more valuable than the few furs found at Anadyrsk.

In 1659, Dezhnyov transferred his authority to Kurbat Ivanov, the discoverer of Lake Baikal. In 1662 he was at Yakutsk. In 1664 he reached Moscow and after selling 4.6 tons of walrus tusks from the North, he became a wealthy man. Also, for his merits as a researcher, he was awarded the title of chieftain. He later served on the Olenyok River and the Vilyuy River. In 1670 he escorted 47,164 rubles (a soldier was paid about 5 rubles a year) of tribute to Moscow and died there in late 1672.

=== Dezhnyov&#x27;s 1648 expedition results ===
As stated above, Dezhnyov traveled with Fedot Alekseyev and two others, Andreev and Afstaf&#x27;iev. Except for Dezhnyov, none of the other leaders of this expedition survived to tell their tale. Dezhnyov rounded the eastern extremity of Asia, East Cape, now known to Russians as Cape Dezhnyov, possibly made landfall on the Diomede Islands, sailed through the Bering Strait, reached the Anadyr River, ascended it and founded the Anadyr ostrog.

Four of the seven vessels were lost before reaching Bering Strait, and Ankudinov&#x27;s koch was wrecked in or near Bering Strait. This meant that only two vessels went beyond the strait. Alekseyev&#x27;s boat is believed by some to had made landfall in the vicinity of the Kamchatka River, further down the coast of Kamchatka. It appears that scholars agree only on the fate of Dezhnyov&#x27;s vessel, which was not lost.

It was widely believed at the time that these vessels had reached the American shore and that their men had founded a Russian settlement there. Such a colony was searched for by many Russian expeditions launched by the Russian-American Company from 1818 on and during the early 1820s.

==A discovery and its re-discovery==

From at least 1575 European geographers had heard of a Strait of Anián connecting the Pacific and Arctic. Some had it at the Bering Strait (map at right) and others had it running from the Gulf of California to Baffin Bay. It is not certain that Russians in Siberia had heard of it. The first Western map to show a Strait of Anian between Asia and North America was probably that of Giacomo Gastaldi in 1562. Many cartographers followed this lead until the time of Bering. The source is said to be an interpretation of Marco Polo, but otherwise the documents do not explain where the idea came from.

Dezhnyov was illiterate or semi-literate and probably did not understand the importance of what he had done. He certainly did not sail across to Alaska, prove that there was no land bridge to the north or south, or compare his knowledge to that of learned geographers. Nowhere did he claim to have discovered the eastern tip of Asia, merely that he had rounded a great rocky projection on his way to the Anadyr.

Dezhnyov left reports at Yakutsk and Moscow but these were ignored, probably because his sea route was of no practical use. For the next 75 years garbled versions of the Dezhnyov story circulated in Siberia. Early Siberian maps are quite distorted but most seem to show a connection between the Arctic and Pacific. A few have hints of Dezhnyov. Dutch travelers heard of an &#x27;Ice Cape&#x27; at the east end of Asia. Bering heard a story that some Russians had sailed from the Lena to Kamchatka. In 1728, Vitus Bering entered the Bering Strait and, by reporting that venture in Europe, gained credit for the discovery. In 1736 Gerhardt Friedrich Müller found Dezhnyov&#x27;s reports in the Yakutsk archives and parts of the story began filtering back to Europe. In 1758 he published &#x27;Nachrichten von Seereisen ...&#x27;, which made the Dezhnyov story generally known. In 1890 Oglobin found a few more documents in the archives. In the 1950s some of the originals that Muller copied were rediscovered in the Yakutsk archives.

===Doubts about Dezhnyov&#x27;s route===
From at least 1777, various people have doubted the Dezhnyov story. The reasons are: 1) poor documentation, 2) that no one was able to repeat Dezhnyov&#x27;s route until Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld in 1878/79 (eight unsuccessful attempts were made between 1649 and 1787; there is some evidence that 1648 was unusually ice-free), 3) and most important, that the documents can be read to imply only that Dezhnyov rounded a cape on the Arctic coast, was wrecked on that coast and wandered for 10 weeks south to the Anadyr. However, most scholars seem to agree that the Dezhnyov story as we have it is basically correct.

==Tributes==
A mountain ridge in Chukotka, a bay of the Bering Sea, a settlement on Amur River, and Cape Dezhnyov (the easternmost cape of Eurasia) are named after Dezhnyov, as is the Dejnev crater on Mars. 

In 1955, a lighthouse on the East coast of Chukotka was dedicated to Dezhnev with a plaque baring his name and details of his journey across the Bering Strait.

The 1971-built icebreaker &quot;Semyon Dezhnev&quot; is named after him.

<text>Candice Kathleen Atherton (21 September 1955 – 30 October 2017) was a British Labour politician and journalist. After serving as a councillor in Islington, where she was mayor, she was Member of Parliament (MP) for Falmouth and Camborne from 1997 to 2005. In her later life she lived in Cornwall and was a member of Cornwall Council.

==Early life==
Atherton was born in Surrey, the daughter of Denis Atherton, a Daily Mirror journalist, and Pamela (née Osborne), a businesswoman. She attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart (now Woldingham School) in Woldingham, Surrey, then Midhurst Grammar School in West Sussex. From the Polytechnic of North London (now London Metropolitan University), she graduated BA in Applied Social Studies in 1985.

==Professional career==
After leaving school, Atherton went to work for the &quot;Portsmouth News&quot;, before leaving after a year to join the Probation Service in West Sussex in 1975. There she worked with young offenders and also helped to set up a women&#x27;s shelter. Atherton worked as a journalist from 1980. In 1984, she co-founded &quot;Everywoman&quot; – a &quot;post-feminist&quot; women&#x27;s magazine – and later co-wrote a book on housing for single homeless people in North London.

==Political career==
In 1982, she led protests within the Labour Party and the CND movement against the Task Force sent to the Falkland Islands.

From 1986 to 1992, she served as a Labour councillor in the London Borough of Islington and was mayor for the year 1989–1990. There she chaired the Women&#x27;s and Disability Committees and became a member of the Association of London Authorities.

Atherton stood for Labour at Chesham and Amersham in the 1992 general election. In the early 1990s, she left London and lived in Westbury, Wiltshire, where she stood unsuccessfully as a Labour candidate in the elections of 1993 to Wiltshire County Council.

She then worked for the Labour Party and Unison, before being selected to fight the three-way marginal seat of Falmouth and Camborne in Cornwall, after the local Labour Party had imposed the first all-women shortlist in the country. Such shortlists were subsequently ruled to be in breach of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, and thus unlawful. Despite that judgement, she remained in place as the candidate for the 1997 general election. Taking Labour from third place to first, she was elected as the Member of Parliament for Falmouth and Camborne, holding the seat until the election of 2005. Atherton&#x27;s victory made her Cornwall&#x27;s first Labour MP since 1970 and first female MP since the 1920s.

She doubled her majority in the 2001 election, having successfully campaigned for Objective One status for Cornwall, for the National Minimum Wage Act 1998, and for a university in Cornwall. She spearheaded the campaign to open a Minor Injuries Unit in Camborne Redruth Community Hospital – now used by more than 12,000 people a year – and the campaign to expose the nerve gas station at Nancekuke (RRH Portreath) in her constituency.
At the 2005 general election, Atherton lost her seat to Liberal Democrat Julia Goldsworthy by a majority of 1,886. Afterwards, she continued to campaign for women&#x27;s political advancement, disability rights and rural housing reform. As of 2021, Atherton is the most recent Labour MP to represent one of the six constituencies of Cornwall.

Paul Phillips, a gay aide Atherton employed for a year until March 2004, resigned and claimed discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, accusing her of homophobia and of asking him to find information on her Conservative opponent in Falmouth because he was also gay. The tribunal found in Atherton&#x27;s favour. Atherton&#x27;s record of voting in the House of Commons was generally supportive of gay rights.

==After Parliament==

From 2005 to 2008, Atherton was a board member of the Housing Corporation and she chaired the Rural Housing Advisory Panel, which advises the British government on rural housing issues. In 2006, she founded Atherton Associates, a public affairs company, and has worked for British Waterways and the Inland Waterways Association and with Weber Shandwick Public Affairs. From October 2008, she was a board member of the Homes and Communities Agency. She was the vice chair of the Truro and Falmouth Constituency Labour Party and was member of the Labour Party&#x27;s South West Regional Board.

Atherton married a Cornishman, Broderick Ross, in 2002, and lived with him in Falmouth, Cornwall. In 2009, Atherton, her husband, her mother Pam Atherton and mother-in law Betty Ross stood for election to the newly formed Cornwall Council. Atherton contested the Carn Brea North division, finishing third in a field of four, with 23% of the vote, while her husband finished last out of four in Camborne Central with 11%. Both seats were won by the Conservatives. Pam Atherton finished last out of six in St Day and Lanner with 3%, and Betty Ross finished last out of seven in Wendron, both of those contests being won by Independents.

Atherton was elected to Cornwall Council in the 2013 local elections, where she represented the Falmouth Smithick division until her death.

In 2014, she acted as the spearhead to pass an Article 4 direction through Cornwall Council, a piece of legislation which requires landlords planning to convert a property into a house of multiple occupancy (HMO) to have planning permission.

She opposed the expansion of Falmouth University in 2016.

==Death==
Atherton died suddenly overnight in Luton, Bedfordshire, on 30 October 2017 at the age of 62. Prime Minister Theresa May paid tribute to her at Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions on 1 November, which were echoed by Leader of the Opposition Jeremy Corbyn. Tom Watson and Ben Bradshaw also paid tribute to Atherton on Twitter.

<text>John Yorke Denham (born 15 July 1953) is an English politician who served as Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills from 2007 to 2009 and Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government from 2009 to 2010. A member of the Labour Party, he was Member of Parliament (MP) for Southampton Itchen from 1992 to 2015.

Denham served in government under Prime Minister Tony Blair from 1997 to 2003, as a Parliamentary under-secretary of state from 1997 to 1998 and a Minister of State from 1998 to 2003. He resigned from government over the Iraq War in 2003, and subsequently became Chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee. Denham returned to government in 2007 as a Member of Prime Minister Gordon Brown&#x27;s Cabinet, which he served in until Labour&#x27;s election defeat in 2010.

He was briefly Shadow Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government in 2010, and appointed by opposition leader Ed Miliband as Shadow Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills later in the same year. Denham announced in 2011 that he would be standing down from Parliament at the next election, and held his final front bench position as Parliamentary private secretary to Miliband from 2011 to 2013.

==Early life==
John Denham was born in Seaton, Devon, and attended Woodroffe School in Lyme Regis, Dorset, and the University of Southampton, where he was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry, and served as president of the students&#x27; union in the academic year 1976–77.

After leaving education in 1977 he became an advice worker at the Energy Advice Agency in Durham, before becoming a transport campaigner with Friends of the Earth in 1978. He was Head of Youth Affairs at the British Council from 1979 until 1983, and was responsible for public education and advocacy for War on Want from 1984 to 1988. He subsequently worked for Christian Aid, Oxfam and other development agencies until his election to Westminster.

===Councillor===
Prior to being elected as an MP, Denham served as a local councillor, initially as a member of the Hampshire County Council in 1981, where he remained until 1989, when he was elected as a councillor on Southampton City Council, on which he served until 1993 and was the chairman of the city&#x27;s Housing Committee. He was selected to contest the Southampton Itchen seat at the 1983 general election following the defection to the Social Democratic Party of the sitting Labour MP Bob Mitchell. The election proved to be a close-run affair, with Denham coming in third place, Mitchell in second, and the victor was the Conservative Christopher Chope who gained the seat with a majority of 5,290.

Denham again contested the seat at the 1987 general election, he overtook Mitchell into second place but was still behind Chope, who held his seat with a majority of 6,716.

==Member of Parliament==
Denham took the seat at the third attempt at the 1992 general election, when he defeated Chope by just 551 votes and remained an MP for 23 years (since 1997 Chope has been MP for the safe Conservative seat of Christchurch, Dorset.). Mitchell did not fight the election this time. Denham made his maiden speech on 20 May 1992, reminding people that the Pilgrim Fathers left from Southampton, and not Plymouth as is widely thought, on their historic voyage to North America.

Denham has held the following positions:
*1995–1997: Shadow Minister for Social Security
*1997–1998: Parliamentary under Secretary of State at the Department of Social Security
*1998–1999: Minister of State at the Department of Social Security
*1999–2001: Minister of State for Health Services
*2001–2003: Minister of State for Policing
*2003–2007: Chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee
*2007–2009: Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills
*2009–2010: Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government
*2010–2011: Shadow Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills
*2011–2013: Parliamentary private secretary to the Leader of the Opposition

=== In government ===
Denham became a member of the Environment Select committee in 1993, and was promoted to the opposition frontbench by Tony Blair in 1995. He was a Shadow Minister for Social Security from 1995 to 1997, responsible for pensions and long-term care. Following the 1997 general election he entered the Blair government as the Parliamentary under-secretary of state at the Department of Social Security, being promoted within the department to the rank of Minister of State in 1998. Following the promotion to the cabinet of Alan Milburn, Denham moved to the Department of Health in 1999.

===Resignation over Iraq War===
Following the 2001 general election he became a Minister of State at the Home Office, until he resigned in March 2003 over the Iraq War.

After his resignation, Denham was appointed in July 2003 as chairman of the influential Home Affairs Select Committee. Despite speculation following the 2005 general election that he would return as a member of the Government, he did not do so, although in the post-election reshuffle there were reports that he was offered – and accepted – the cabinet post of Chief Secretary to the Treasury, before being told that the post had been assigned instead to Des Browne.

Though regarded as a Blairite, Denham was a regular critic of the Blair administration as chair of the Home Affairs committee.

===Return to Government===
Following Brown&#x27;s installation as Prime Minister in June 2007, Denham was named to take over the new post of Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills. In September 2007, he announced funding for students taking second degrees would be re-allocated to allow more students to take first degrees: adult and continuing education institutions such as the Open University, Birkbeck, University of London, and lifelong learning departments throughout the country, have voiced angry protest at the proposals.

During Denham&#x27;s tenure as Secretary of State, he also announced an extension of maintenance grants to students from households earning up to £60,000 a year. The changes mean that an additional 50,000 students would be entitled to a full grant and an additional 100,000 students would be entitled to a partial grant.

As part of the Cabinet reshuffle on 5 June 2009, Denham was appointed to the role of Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. He replaced Hazel Blears who had resigned from the post on 3 June 2009.

On 7 October 2011, Denham announced that he would be standing down at the 2015 general election.

In June 2012, Denham said that Labour knew as early as 2005 that the immigration estimates they had relied on were &quot;vastly wrong&quot;.

He was seen as a government loyalist and University of Southampton Students&#x27; Union had revoked his lifetime membership for his support of tuition fees.

== Post-parliamentary career ==
Denham is Chair of the Southern Policy Centre, which he co-founded with Professor Francis Davis, as a think tank responding to challenges and opportunities for southern England with specialisms in open data research and new forms of public participation in politics.

Denham is director of the English Labour Network and a Professorial Fellow on English Identity and Politics at Southampton University.

==Honours==
Denham was sworn in as a member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom in 2000, giving him the honorific title &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; for life. He is also a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, giving him the Post Nominal Letters &quot;FRSA&quot;.

== Personal life ==
He married Ruth Eleanor Dixon and they have two children; they have now divorced. He has another child born in 2005.
In an interview with the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, Denham stated that he was a secular humanist, although he also said he learnt a lot from his Church of England upbringing.

<doc id="413992" wikidata="Q11302322" url="?curid=413992" title="History of Connecticut">
<text>The U.S. state of Connecticut began as three distinct settlements of Puritans from Massachusetts and England; they combined under a single royal charter in 1663. Known as the &quot;land of steady habits&quot; for its political, social and religious conservatism, the colony prospered from the trade and farming of its ethnic English Protestant population. The Congregational and Unitarian churches became prominent here. Connecticut played an active role in the American Revolution, and became a bastion of the conservative, business-oriented, Constitutionalism Federalist Party.

The word &quot;Connecticut&quot; is a French corruption of the Algonkian word &quot;quinetucket&quot;, which means &quot;beside the long, tidal river&quot;.

Reverend Thomas Hooker and John Haynes led a group of about 100 who, in 1636, founded the settlement of Hartford, named for Stone&#x27;s place of birth: Hertford, in England. Called today &quot;the Father of Connecticut,&quot; Thomas Hooker was a towering figure in the early development of colonial New England. He was one of the great preachers of his time, an erudite writer on Christian subjects, the first minister of Cambridge, Massachusetts, one of the first settlers and founders of both the city of Hartford and the state of Connecticut, and cited by many as the inspiration for the &quot;Fundamental Orders of Connecticut,&quot; cited by some as the world&#x27;s first written democratic constitution that established a representative government.

The state took a leading role in the Industrial Revolution of the United States, with its many factories establishing a worldwide reputation for advanced machinery. The educational and intellectual establishment was strongly led by Yale College, by scholars such as Noah Webster and by writers such as Mark Twain, who lived in Connecticut after establishing his association with the Mississippi River. Many Yankees left the farms to migrate west to New York and the Midwest in the early nineteenth century. Meanwhile, the heavy demand for labor in the nineteenth century attracted Irish, English and Italian immigrants, among many others, to the medium and small industrial cities. In the early 20th century, immigrants came from eastern and southern Europe. While the state produced few nationally prominent political leaders, Connecticut has usually been a swing state closely balanced between the parties. In the 21st century, the state is known for production of jet engines, nuclear submarines, and advanced pharmaceuticals.

==First People==
The name Connecticut is derived from the Mohegan-Pequot word that has been translated as &quot;long tidal river&quot; and &quot;upon the long river&quot;, referring to the Connecticut River. Evidence of human presence in the Connecticut region dates to as much as 10,000 years ago. Stone tools were used for hunting, fishing, and woodworking. Semi-nomadic in lifestyle, these peoples moved seasonally to take advantage of various resources in the area. They shared languages based on Algonquian. The Connecticut region was inhabited by multiple Indian tribes which can be grouped into the Nipmuc, the Sequin or &quot;River Indians&quot; (which included the Tunxis, Schaghticoke, Podunk, Wangunk, Hammonassett, and Quinnipiac), the Mattabesec or &quot;Wappinger Confederacy&quot; and the Pequot-Mohegan. Some of these groups continue to abide in Connecticut, including the Mohegans, the Pequots, and the Paugusetts.

==Colonies in Connecticut==

Various Algonquian tribes long inhabited the area prior to European settlement. The Dutch were the first Europeans in Connecticut. In 1614 Adriaen Block explored the coast of Long Island Sound, and sailed up the Connecticut River at least as far as the confluence of the Park River, site of modern Hartford. By 1623, the new Dutch West India Company regularly traded for furs there and ten years later they fortified it for protection from the Pequot Indians, as well as from the expanding English colonies. The site was named &quot;House of Hope&quot; (also identified as &quot;Fort Hoop&quot;, &quot;Good Hope&quot; and &quot;Hope&quot;), but encroaching English colonists made them agree to withdraw in the 1650 Treaty of Hartford. By 1654 they were gone, before the English took over New Netherland in 1664.

The first English colonists came from the Bay Colony and Plymouth Colony in Massachusetts. Original Connecticut Colony settlements were at Windsor in 1633; at Wethersfield in 1634; and in 1636, at Hartford and Springfield, (the latter was administered by Connecticut until defecting in 1640.) The Hartford settlement was led by Reverend Thomas Hooker.

In 1631, the Earl of Warwick granted a patent to a company of investors headed by William Fiennes, 1st Viscount Saye and Sele, and Robert Greville, 2nd Baron Brooke. They funded the establishment of the Saybrook Colony (named for the two lords) at the mouth of the Connecticut River, where Fort Saybrook, was erected in 1636. Another Puritan group left Massachusetts and started the New Haven Colony farther west on the northern shore of Long Island Sound in 1637. The Massachusetts colonies did not seek to govern their progeny in Connecticut and Rhode Island. Communication and travel were too difficult, and it was also convenient to have a place for nonconformists to go.

The English settlement and trading post at Windsor especially threatened the Dutch trade, since it was upriver and more accessible to Native people from the interior. That fall and winter the Dutch sent a party upriver as far as modern Springfield, Massachusetts, spreading gifts to convince the indigenous inhabitants in the area to bring their trade to the Dutch post at Hartford. They also spread smallpox and, by the end of the 1633–34 winter, the Native population of the entire valley was reduced from over 8,000 to less than 2,000. Europeans took advantage of this decimation by further settling the fertile valley.

===The Pequot War===

The Pequot War was the first serious armed conflict between the indigenous peoples and the European settlers in New England. The ravages of disease, coupled with trade pressures, invited the Pequots to tighten their hold on the river tribes. Additional incidents began to involve the colonists in the area in 1635, and next spring their raid on Wethersfield prompted the three towns to meet. Following the raid on Wethersfield, the war climaxed when 300 Pequot men, women, and children were burned out of their village, in Mystic.

On May 1, 1637, leaders of Connecticut Colony&#x27;s river towns each sent delegates to the first General Court held at the meeting house in Hartford. This was the start of self-government in Connecticut. They pooled their militia under the command of John Mason of Windsor, and declared war on the Pequots. When the war was over, the Pequots had been destroyed as a tribe. In the Treaty of Hartford in 1638, the various New England colonies and their Native allies divided the lands of the Pequots, along with surviving Pequots, taken captive by the various tribes, amongst themselves.

===New Haven Colony, 1638-1664===

In 1637 a group of London merchants and their families, disgusted with the high Church Anglicanism around them, moved to Boston with the intention of creating a new settlement. The leaders were John Davenport, a Puritan minister, and Theophilus Eaton, a wealthy merchant who brought £3000 to the venture. They understood theology, business and trade, but had no farming experience. The good port locations in Massachusetts had been taken, but with the removal of the Pequot Indians, there were good harbors available on Long Island Sound. Eaton found a good location in spring 1638 which he named New Haven. The site seemed ideal for trade, with a good port lying between Boston and the Dutch city of New Amsterdam (New York City), and good access to the furs of the Connecticut River valley settlements of Hartford and Springfield. The settlers had no official charter or permissions, and did not purchase any land rights from the local Indians. Legally, they were squatters. Minister Davenport was an Oxford-educated intellectual, and he set up a grammar school and wanted to establish a college, but failed to do so. The leaders attempted numerous merchandising enterprises, but they all failed. Much of their money went into a great ship sent to London in 1646, with £5000 in cargo of grain and beaver pelts. It never arrived.

The history of the New Haven colony was a series of disappointments and failures. The most serious problem was that it never had a legal title to exist, that is a charter, though the same can be said for Connecticut for most of this period. The larger, stronger colony of Connecticut to the north did obtain Royal charter in 1662, and it was aggressive in using its military superiority to force a takeover. New Haven had other weaknesses as well. The leaders were businessmen and traders, but they were never able to build up a large or profitable trade, because their agricultural base was poor, and the location was isolated. Farming on the poor soil of the colony was a formula for poverty and discouragement. New Haven&#x27;s political system was confined to church members only, and the refusal to widen it alienated many people. More and more it was realized that the New Haven colony was a hopeless endeavor. Oliver Cromwell recommended that they all migrate to Ireland, or to Spanish territories that he planned to conquer. After Cromwell died three regicides who (with Cromwell) had voted to execute King Charles I escaped from England and hid in New Haven. The colony had a very negative standing in London, and plans were afoot to merge it with New York. But the Puritans of New Haven were too conservative, and too wedded to their new land to leave or join the Anglicans in New York. One by one in 1662-64 the towns joined Connecticut until only three were left and they too submitted to the Connecticut Colony in 1664. They gave up their theocracy but became well integrated, with numerous important leaders and (after Yale opened in 1701), influential academics.

===Under the Fundamental Orders===
The three River Towns, Wethersfield, Windsor and Hartford, had created a general government when faced with the demands of a war. On January 14, 1639, freemen from these three settlements ratified the &quot;Fundamental Orders of Connecticut&quot; in what John Fiske called &quot;the first written constitution known to history that created a government. It marked the beginnings of American democracy, of which Thomas Hooker deserves more than any other man to be called the father. The government of the United States today is in lineal descent more nearly related to that of Connecticut than to that of any of the other thirteen colonies.&quot; Rapid growth and expansion grew under this new regime.

On April 22, 1662, the Connecticut Colony succeeded in gaining a Royal Charter that embodied and confirmed the self-government that they had created with the Fundamental Orders. The only significant change was that it called for a single Connecticut government with a southern limit at the Long Island Sound, including today Suffolk County on Long Island, and a western limit of the Pacific Ocean, which meant that this charter was still in conflict with the New Netherland colony.

Indian pressures were relieved for some time by success in the ferocious Pequot War. While the Pequots themselves gathered again along the Thames River, other tribes, especially the Mohegans, grew more powerful, though they had a rivalry with the Narragansetts located in Western Rhode Island and Eastern Connecticut, and this rivalry shaped in a large part diplomatic matters between both Indian tribes and colonial affairs. King Philip&#x27;s War (1675–1676) spilled over from Plymouth Colony; Connecticut provided troops and supplies. Connecticut&#x27;s contribution to the war also included the large number of Indian allies they brought into the war, including the Mohegans, led by Uncas and the Pequots, of which a small population had reformed from runaway slaves taken at the end of the Pequot War. The participation of Native Allies is in a large part responsible for the Colonial Victory, and this participation was largely due to Connecticut&#x27;s involvement, as they generally had the best relationships with their local Native tribes, in particular the Mohegans. The colonists had seen some Indians as a potential deadly threat, and mobilized during both the Pequot war and King Philip&#x27;s War to eliminate them. More than three-fourths of all adult men provided some form of military service. Given the numbers of Native troops fighting with the colonists, along with estimates of Native populations, it is likely that an even larger proportion of Native troops served with Connecticut.

===The Dominion of New England===
In 1686, Sir Edmund Andros was commissioned as the Royal Governor of the Dominion of New England. Andros maintained that his commission superseded Connecticut&#x27;s 1662 charter. At first, Connecticut ignored this situation. But in late October 1687, Andros arrived with troops and naval support. Governor Robert Treat had no choice but to convene the assembly. Andros met with the governor and General Court on the evening of October 31, 1687.
Governor Andros praised their industry and government, but after he read them his commission, he demanded their charter. As they placed it on the table, people blew out all the candles. When the light was restored, the charter was missing. According to legend, it was hidden in the Charter Oak. Sir Edmund named four members to his Council for the Government of New England and proceeded to his capital at Boston.

Since Andros viewed New York and Massachusetts as the important parts of his Dominion, he mostly ignored Connecticut. Aside from some taxes demanded and sent to Boston, Connecticut also mostly ignored the new government. When word arrived that the Glorious Revolution had placed William and Mary on the throne, the citizens of Boston arrested Andros and sent him back to England in chains. The Connecticut court met and voted on May 9, 1689, to restore the old charter. They also reelected Robert Treat as governor each year until 1698.
==Territorial disputes==

According to the 1650 Treaty of Hartford with the Dutch, the western boundary of Connecticut ran north from the west side of Greenwich Bay &quot;provided the said line come not within of Hudson River.&quot; On the other hand, Connecticut&#x27;s original charter in 1662 granted it all the land to the &quot;South Sea&quot; (i.e. the Pacific Ocean).
:ALL that parte of our dominions in Newe England in America bounded on the East by Norrogancett River, commonly called Norrogancett Bay, where the said River falleth into the Sea, and on the North by the lyne of the Massachusetts Plantacon, and on the south by the Sea, and in longitude as the lyne of the Massachusetts Colony, runinge from East to West, (that is to say) from the Said Norrogancett Bay on the East to the South Sea on the West parte, with the Islands thervnto adioyneinge, Together with all firme lands ... TO HAVE AND TO HOLD ... for ever...

===Dispute with New York===

This claim brought Connecticut into territorial dispute with those states which then lay between Connecticut and the Pacific. A patent issued on March 12, 1664, granted the Duke of York (later James II &amp; VII) &quot;all the land from the west side of Connecticut River to the east side of Delaware Bay.&quot; In October 1664, Connecticut and New York agreed to grant Long Island to New York, and establish the boundary between Connecticut and New York as a line from the Mamaroneck River &quot;north-northwest to the line of the Massachusetts&quot;, crossing the Hudson River near Peekskill and the boundary of Massachusetts near the northwest corner of the current Ulster County, New York. This agreement was never really accepted, however, and boundary disputes continued. The Governor of New York issued arrest warrants for residents of Greenwich, Rye, and Stamford, and founded a settlement north of Tarrytown in what Connecticut considered part of its territory in May 1682. In 1675, with King Philip&#x27;s War posing significant pressure on Connecticut, New York attempted to land a force at Saybrook, in an attempt to take hold of the Connecticut River, and to assert their claim over all lands west of the Connecticut River itself, though these forces were repelled by Connecticut Colonial forces without a fight. Finally, on November 28, 1683, the states negotiated a new agreement establishing the border as east of the Hudson River, north to Massachusetts. In recognition of the wishes of the residents, the east of the Byram River making up the Connecticut Panhandle were granted to Connecticut. In exchange, Rye was granted to New York, along with a strip of land running north from Ridgefield to Massachusetts alongside Dutchess, Putnam, and Westchester Counties, New York, known as the &quot;Oblong&quot;.

===Dispute with Pennsylvania===

In the 1750s, the western frontier remained on the other side of New York. In 1754 the Susquehannah Company of Windham, Connecticut, obtained from a group of Native Americans a deed to a tract of land along the Susquehanna River which covered about one-third of present-day Pennsylvania. This venture met with the disapproval of not only Pennsylvania, but also of many in Connecticut including the Deputy Governor, who opposed Governor Jonathan Trumbull&#x27;s support for the company, fearing that pressing these claims would endanger the charter of the colony. In 1769, Wilkes-Barre was founded by John Durkee and a group of 240 Connecticut settlers. The British government finally ruled &quot;that no Connecticut settlements could be made until the royal pleasure was known&quot;. In 1773 the issue was settled in favor of Connecticut and Westmoreland, Connecticut, was established as a town and later a county.

Pennsylvania did not accede to the ruling, however, and open warfare broke out between them and Connecticut, ending with an attack in July 1778, which killed approximately 150 of the settlers and forced thousands to flee. While they periodically attempted to regain their land, they were continuously repulsed, until, in December 1783, a commission ruled in favor of Pennsylvania. After complex litigation, in 1786, Connecticut dropped its claims by a deed of cession to Congress, in exchange for freedom for war debt and confirmation of the rights to land further west in present-day Ohio, which became known as the Western Reserve. Pennsylvania granted the individual settlers from Connecticut the titles to their land claims. Although the region had been called Westmoreland County, Connecticut, it has no relationship with the current Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania.

The Western Reserve, which Connecticut received in recompense for giving up all claims to any Pennsylvania land in 1786, constituted a strip of land in what is currently northeast Ohio, wide from east to west bordering Lake Erie and Pennsylvania. Connecticut owned this territory until selling it to the Connecticut Land Company in 1795 for $1,200,000, which resold parcels of land to settlers. In 1796, the first settlers, led by Moses Cleaveland, began a community which was to become Cleveland, Ohio; in a short time, the area became known as &quot;New Connecticut&quot;.

An area wide at the western end of the Western Reserve, set aside by Connecticut in 1792 to compensate those from Danbury, New Haven, Fairfield, Norwalk, and New London who had suffered heavy losses when they were burnt out by fires set by British raids during the War of Independence, became known as the Firelands. By this time, however, most of those granted the relief by the state were either dead or too old to actually move there. The Firelands now constitutes Erie and Huron Counties, as well as part of Ashland County, Ohio.

==Conservatism==
Connecticut was the land of steady habits, with a conservative elite that dominated colonial affairs. The forces of liberalism and democracy emerged slowly, encouraged by the entrepreneurship of the business community, and the new religious freedom stimulated by the First Great Awakening.

Yale College was founded in 1701 to educate ministers and civil leaders. After moving about it settled in New Haven. Just as Yale College dominated Connecticut&#x27;s intellectual life, the Congregational church dominated religion in the colony. It was officially established until 1818, and the residents of each town were all required to attend Sunday services and to pay taxes to support it (or else prove they supported a Baptist or some other Protestant church).

Centralizing forces made the Congregational church even more powerful and more conservative. The Saybrook Platform was a new constitution for the Congregational church in 1708. Religious and civic leaders in Connecticut around 1700 were distressed by the colony-wide decline in personal religious piety and in church discipline. The colonial legislature sponsored a meeting in Saybrook comprising eight Yale trustees and other colonial worthies. It drafted articles which rejected extreme localism or Congregationalism that had been inherited from England, and replaced it with a system similar to what the Presbyterians had. The Congregational church was now to be led by local ministerial associations and consociations comprising ministers and lay leaders from a specific geographical area. Instead of the congregation from each local church selecting its minister, the associations now had the responsibility to examine candidates for the ministry, and to oversee a behavior of the ministers. The consociations (where laymen were powerless) could impose discipline on specific churches and judge disputes that arose. The result was a centralization of power that bothered many local church activists. However, the official associations responded by disfellowshipping churches that refuse to comply. The system survived to the mid-nineteenth century, well after Congregationalism was officially this disestablished in the state of Connecticut.

The Platform marked a conservative counter-revolution against a non-conformist tide which had begun with the Halfway Covenant and would later culminate in the Great Awakening in the 1740s. The Great Awakening bitterly divided Congregationalists between the &quot;New Lights&quot; who welcomed the revivals, and the &quot;Old Lights&quot; who used governmental authority to suppress revivals.

The legislature, controlled by the Old Lights, in 1742 passed an &quot;Act for regulating abuses and correcting disorder in ecclesiastical affairs&quot; that sharply restricted ministers from leading revivals. Another law was passed to prevent the opening of a New Light seminary. Numerous New Light evangelicals were imprisoned or fined. The New Lights responded by their own political organization, fighting it out town by town. Although the religious issues decline somewhat after 1748, the New Light versus Old Light factionalism spilled into other issues, such as disputes over currency, and Imperial issues. However, the divisions involved did not play a role in the coming of the American Revolution, which both sides supported.

The career of a soldier was not held in high prestige in Connecticut. However, London demanded some assistance in its numerous wars against France, so the colony sent soldiers into Canada, 1709–1711, during Queen Anne&#x27;s War. Silesky argues that Connecticut followed the same procedure for the rest of the century. Elites in control of the government used cash bounties to encourage poor men to volunteer to serve temporarily.
Governor Jonathan Trumbull was elected every year from 1769 to 1784. Connecticut&#x27;s political system was practically unaffected by the Revolution.

==The American Revolution (1775–1789)==

The conservative elite strongly supported the American revolution, and the forces of Loyalism were weak. Connecticut designated four delegates to the Second Continental Congress who would sign the Declaration of Independence: Samuel Huntington, Roger Sherman, William Williams, and Oliver Wolcott.

In 1775, in the wake of the clashes between British regulars and Massachusetts militia at Lexington and Concord, Connecticut&#x27;s legislature authorized the outfitting of six new regiments, with some 1,200 Connecticut troops on hand at the Battle of Bunker Hill in June 1775.

Getting word in 1777 of Continental Army supplies in Danbury, the British landed an expeditionary force of some 2,000 troops in Westport, who marched to Danbury and destroyed much of the depot along with homes in Danbury. On the return march, Continental Army troops and militia led by General David Wooster and General Benedict Arnold engaged the British at Ridgefield in 1777, which would deter future strategic landing attempts by the British for the remainder of the war.

For the winter of 1778–79, General George Washington decided to split the Continental Army into three divisions encircling New York City, where British General Sir Henry Clinton had taken up winter quarters. Major General Israel Putnam chose Redding as the winter encampment quarters for some 3,000 regulars and militia under his command. The Redding encampment allowed Putnam&#x27;s soldiers to guard the replenished supply depot in Danbury and support any operations along Long Island Sound and the Hudson River Valley. Some of the men were veterans of the winter encampment at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, the previous winter. Soldiers at the Redding camp endured supply shortages, cold temperatures and significant snow, with some historians dubbing the encampment &quot;Connecticut&#x27;s Valley Forge.&quot;

The state was also the launching site for a number of raids against Long Island orchestrated by Samuel Holden Parsons and Benjamin Tallmadge, and provided soldiers and material for the war effort, especially to Washington&#x27;s army outside New York City. General William Tryon raided the Connecticut coast in July 1779, focusing on New Haven, Norwalk, and Fairfield. The French General the Comte de Rochambeau celebrated the first Catholic Mass in Connecticut at Lebanon in summer 1781 while marching through the state from Rhode Island to rendezvous with General George Washington in Dobbs Ferry, New York. Rochambeau and Washington also planned in Wethersfield the Battle of Yorktown and the British surrender. New London and Groton Heights were raided in September 1781 by Connecticut native and turncoat Benedict Arnold.

==Early National Period (1789–1818)==
New England was the stronghold of the Federalist party. One historian explains how well organized it was in Connecticut:
:It was only necessary to perfect the working methods of the organized body of office-holders who made up the nucleus of the party. There were the state officers, the assistants, and a large majority of the Assembly. In every county there was a sheriff with his deputies. All of the state, county, and town judges were potential and generally active workers. Every town had several justices of the peace, school directors and, in Federalist towns, all the town officers who were ready to carry on the party&#x27;s work. Every parish had a &quot;standing agent,&quot; whose anathemas were said to convince at least ten voting deacons. Militia officers, state&#x27;s attorneys, lawyers, professors and schoolteachers were in the van of this &quot;conscript army.&quot; In all, about a thousand or eleven hundred dependent officer-holders were described as the inner ring which could always be depended upon for their own and enough more votes within their control to decide an election. This was the Federalist machine.

Given the power of the Federalists, the Republicans had to work harder to win. In 1806, the state leadership sent town leaders instructions for the forthcoming elections. Every town manager was told by state leaders &quot;to appoint a district manager in each district or section of his town, obtaining from each an assurance that he will faithfully do his duty.&quot; Then, the town manager was instructed to compile lists and total up the number of taxpayers, the number of eligible voters, how many were &quot;decided republicans,&quot; &quot;decided federalists,&quot; or &quot;doubtful,&quot; and finally to count the number of supporters who were not currently eligible to vote but who might qualify (by age or taxes) at the next election. These highly detailed returns were to be sent to the county manager. They, in turn, were to compile county-wide statistics and send it on to the state manager. Using the newly compiled lists of potential voters, the managers were told to get all the eligibles to the town meetings, and help the young men qualify to vote. At the annual official town meeting, the managers were told to, &quot;notice what republicans are present, and see that each stays and votes till the whole business is ended. And each District-Manager shall report to the Town-Manager the names of all republicans absent, and the cause of absence, if known to him.&quot; Of utmost importance, the managers had to nominate candidates for local elections, and to print and distribute the party ticket. The state manager was responsible for supplying party newspapers to each town for distribution by town and district managers. This highly coordinated &quot;get-out-the-vote&quot; drive would be familiar to modern political campaigners, but was the first of its kind in world history.

Connecticut prospered during the era, as the seaports were busy and the first textile factories were built. The American Embargo and the British blockade during the War of 1812 severely hurt the export business, and bolstered the Federalists who strongly opposed the Embargo and the War of 1812. The cutoff of imports from Britain did stimulate the rapid growth of factories to replace the textiles and machinery. Eli Whitney of New Haven was a leader of the engineers and inventors who made the state a world leader in machine tools and industrial technology generally, especially the cotton gin and mass production methods. The state was known for its political conservatism, typified by its Federalist party and the Yale College of Timothy Dwight. The foremost intellectuals were Dwight and Noah Webster, who compiled his great dictionary in New Haven. Religious tensions polarized the state, as the established Congregational Church, in alliance with the Federalists, tried to maintain its grip on power. The failure of the Hartford Convention in 1814 wounded the Federalists, who were finally upended by the Republicans in 1817.

==Modernization and industry==

Up until this time, Connecticut had adhered to the 1662 Charter, and with the independence of the American colonies over forty years prior, much of what the Charter stood for was no longer relevant. In 1818, a new constitution was adopted that was the first piece of written legislation to separate church and state in Connecticut, and give equality to all religions. Gubernatorial powers were also expanded as well as increased independence for courts by allowing their judges to serve life terms.

Connecticut started off with the raw materials of abundant running water and navigable waterways, and using the Yankee work ethic quickly became an industrial leader. Between the birth of the U.S. patent system in 1790 and 1930, Connecticut had more patents issued per capita than any other state; in the 1800s, when the U.S. as a whole was issued one patent per three thousand population, Connecticut inventors were issued one patent for every 700–1000 residents. Connecticut&#x27;s first recorded invention was a lapidary machine, by Abel Buell of Killingworth, in 1765.

==Abolition and integration==
Starting in the 1830s, and accelerating when Connecticut abolished slavery entirely in 1848, African Americans from in- and out-of-state began relocating to urban centers for employment and opportunity, forming new neighborhoods such as Bridgeport&#x27;s Little Liberia.

In 1832, Quaker schoolteacher Prudence Crandall created the first integrated schoolhouse in the United States by admitting Sarah Harris, the daughter of a free African-American farmer in the local community, to her Canterbury Female Boarding School in Canterbury. Many prominent townspeople objected and pressured to have Harris dismissed from the school, but Crandall refused. Families of the current students removed their daughters. Consequently, Crandall ceased teaching white girls altogether and opened up her school strictly to African American girls. In 1995, the Connecticut General Assembly designated Prudence Crandall as the state&#x27;s official heroine.

==Civil War era==

Connecticut manufacturers played a leading role in supplying the Union forces with rifles, cannon, ammunition, and military materiel during the Civil War. The state furnished 55,000 soldiers. They were formed into thirty full regiments of infantry, including two in the U.S. Colored Troops made up of black men and white officers. Two regiments of heavy artillery served as infantry toward the end of the war. Connecticut also supplied three batteries of light artillery and one regiment of cavalry. The Navy attracted 250 officers and 2,100 sailors. A number of Connecticut men became Union generals; Gideon Welles was a moderate whom Lincoln made Secretary of the Navy. Casualties were high: 2088 were killed in combat, 2801 died from disease, and 689 died in Confederate prison camps.

Politics became red hot during the war. A surge of national unity in 1861 brought thousands flocking to the colors from every town and city. However, as the war became a crusade to end slavery, many Democrats (especially Irish Catholics) pulled back. The Democrats took a peace position and included many Copperheads willing to let the South secede. The intensely fought 1863 election for governor was narrowly won by the Republicans.

Connecticut&#x27;s extensive industry, its dense population, its flat terrain, its proximity to metropolitan centers, and the wealth of its residents made it favorable grounds for railroad building, starting in 1839. By 1840, 102 miles of line were in operation, growing to 402 in 1850 and 601 in 1860. The main development after the Civil War was the consolidation of many small local lines into the New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad – popularly called &quot;the Consolidated.&quot; It sought a monopoly of all transportation, including urban streetcar lines, inter-urban trolleys, and freighters and passenger steamers on Long Island Sound. It was a highly profitable enterprise, until it was bought out in 1903 and suffered serious mismanagement.

==Twentieth century==

===Railroads===

The New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, commonly called the &quot;New Haven&quot;, dominated Connecticut travel after 1872. New York&#x27;s leading banker, J. P. Morgan, had grown up in Hartford and had a strong interest in the New England economy. Starting in the 1890s Morgan began financing the major New England railroads, and dividing territory so they would not compete. In 1903 he brought in Charles Mellen as president (1903–1913). The goal, richly supported by Morgan&#x27;s financing, was to purchase and consolidate the main railway lines of New England, merge their operations, lower their costs, electrify the heavily used routes, and modernize the system. With less competition and lower costs, there supposedly would be higher profits. The New Haven purchased 50 smaller companies, including steamship lines, and built a network of light rails (electrified trolleys) that provided inter-urban transportation for all of southern New England. By 1912, the New Haven operated over 2000 miles of track, and 120,000 employees. It practically monopolized traffic in a wide swath from Boston to New York City.

Morgan&#x27;s quest for monopoly angered reformers during the Progressive Era, most notably Boston lawyer Louis Brandeis, who fought the New Haven for years. Mellen&#x27;s abrasive tactics alienated public opinion, led to high prices for acquisitions and to costly construction. The accident rate rose when efforts were made to save on maintenance costs. Debt soared from $14 million in 1903 to $242 million in 1913. Also in 1913 it was hit by an anti-trust lawsuit by the federal government and was forced to give up its trolley systems. The advent of automobiles, trucks and buses after 1910 slashed the profits of the New Haven. The line went bankrupt in 1935, was reorganized and reduced in scope, went bankrupt again in 1961, and in 1969 was merged into the Penn Central system, which itself went bankrupt. The remnants of the system are now part of Conrail.

The automotive revolution came much faster than anyone expected, especially the railroads. In 1915 Connecticut had 40,000 automobiles; five years later it had 120,000. There was even faster growth in trucks from 7,000 to 24,000. Local government started upgrading the roads, while entrepreneurs opened dealerships, gasoline stations, repair shops and motels.

===Politics===
The Republicans dominated state politics after 1896, and had a lock on the legislature where the one-town, one representative rule guaranteed that small rural towns could easily outvote the growing cities. While the Republicans developed factions over personalities, they drew together for elections. The Democrats had more internal dissension over issues, particularly the liberalism of William Jennings Bryan, and they were weakened in general elections. The rural Yankee Democrats battled the urban Irish for control of the state party. Most of the factory workers voted Republican (except the Irish Catholics, who were generally Democrats), so most of the industrial cities voted Republican. 

In 1910, the Democrats elected their gubernatorial candidate Simeon E. Baldwin, a prominent professor at the Yale Law School. As the Republican vote was split between President William Taft and ex-president Theodore Roosevelt, the Democrats flourished in 1912, carrying the state for president, reelecting Baldwin, sweeping all five congressional districts with ethnic Irish candidates, and taking the state Senate. Only the malapportioned House remained in Republican hands and dominated by rural areas. The state did not participate much in the &quot;progressive era,&quot; and the Democrats passed only one piece of liberal legislation, which set up a system of workman&#x27;s compensation. In 1914, the Republicans consolidated again and restored their control of state politics. J. Henry Roraback was the Republican state leader from 1912 to his death in 1937. His machine, says Lockard, was &quot;efficient, conservative, penurious, and in absolute control.&quot; Until the New Deal coalition of the 1930s pulled ethnic voters solidly into the Democratic Party, Roraback was unbeatable with his strong rural organization, funding from the business community, conservative policies, and a hierarchical party organization. Connecticut was the last state (in 1955) to adopt the party primary system, and it was used only if a loser wanted to challenge the choice of the state convention.

===World War I===
When World War I broke out in 1914, Connecticut&#x27;s large machine industry received major contracts from British, Canadian, and French interests, as well as the U.S. forces. The largest munitions firms were Remington in Bridgeport, Winchester in New Haven, and Colt in Hartford, as well as the large federal arsenal in Bridgeport.

The state enthusiastically supported the American war effort in 1917–1918, with large purchases of war bonds and a further expansion of war industry, and emphasis on increasing food production in the farms. Thousands of state, local and volunteer groups mobilized for the war effort, and were coordinated by the Connecticut State Council of Defense.

As the war ended the worldwide epidemic of &quot;Spanish Flu&quot; hit the state. Fatalities were high because the state was a travel hub, was heavily urbanized so germs spread faster, and had many recent immigrants in densely settled areas. An estimated 8500-9000 people died, about one percent of the population, and about one-quarter contracted the disease.

===Early 20th-century immigrants and ethnicity===
Connecticut factories in Bridgeport, New Haven, Waterbury and Hartford were magnets for European immigrants. The largest groups were Italian, and Polish and other Eastern Europeans. They brought Catholic unskilled labor to a historically Protestant state. A significant number of Jewish immigrants also arrived in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Connecticut&#x27;s population was almost 30% foreign-born by 1910.

These ethnic groups supported the World War (the small numbers of German Americans tried to keep a low profile, encountering hostility and suspicion after the US entered the war.) Ethnic organizations supported an Americanization program for the many recent immigrants. Since transatlantic civilian travel was almost impossible in 1914–20, the flow of new immigrants ended. Recently arrived Italians, Poles and others had to cancel plans to return to their home villages. They moved up as higher-paying jobs opened in the munitions industry. They deepened their roots in American society, and became permanent residents. Instead of identifying with their former ancestral villages, the Italians developed a new pride in being both Americans and Italians. Their children, born in the U.S. and bilingual, flourished economically in the prosperous 1920s. The Poles enlisted in large numbers, and generously supported war bond efforts. They were motivated in part by the government&#x27;s commitment to a process to support an independent Poland, which was achieved after the end of the war.

Nativists in the 1920s opposed the new immigrants as a threat to the state&#x27;s traditional social and political values. The Ku Klux Klan had a small anti-Catholic and anti-immigrant following in Connecticut in the 1920s, reaching about 15,000 members before its collapse nationwide in 1926 following scandals involving top leaders.

===Depression and War years===

With rising unemployment in urban and rural areas producing disaffection with Republican leaders, Connecticut Democrats saw a chance to return to power. The hero of the movement was Yale English professor Governor Wilbur Lucius Cross (1931–1939), who emulated much of Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal policies by creating new public services, contributing to infrastructure projects, and instituting a minimum wage. The Merritt Parkway was constructed in this period as part of the investment in infrastructure.

In 1938, the state Democratic Party was wracked by controversy, and the Republicans elected Governor Raymond E. Baldwin. Connecticut became a highly competitive, two-party state.

On September 21, 1938, the most destructive storm in New England history struck eastern Connecticut, killing hundreds of people. The eye of the &quot;Long Island Express&quot; hurricane passed just west of New Haven and devastated the Connecticut shoreline between Old Saybrook and Stonington, which lacked the partial protection from the full force of wind and waves provided to the western coast by the barrier of Long Island, New York. The hurricane caused extensive damage to infrastructure, homes and businesses. In New London, a 500-foot sailing ship was driven into a warehouse complex, causing a major fire. Heavy rainfall caused the Connecticut River to flood downtown Hartford and East Hartford. An estimated 50,000 trees fell onto roadways.

The lingering Depression soon gave way to an economic buildup as the United States invested in its defense industry before and during World War II (1941–1945). Roosevelt&#x27;s call for America to be the Arsenal of Democracy led to remarkable growth in munition-related industries, such as airplane engines, radio, radar, proximity fuzes, rifles, and a thousand other products. Pratt &amp; Whitney manufactured airplane engines, Cheney sewed silk parachutes, and Electric Boat built submarines. This was coupled with traditional manufacturing including guns, ships, uniforms, munitions, and artillery. Connecticut manufactured 4.1 percent of total United States military armaments produced during World War II, ranking ninth among the 48 states. Ken Burns focused on Waterbury&#x27;s munitions production in his 2007 miniseries &quot;The War&quot;. Although most munitions production ended in 1945, new industries had resulted from the war, and manufacturing of high tech electronics and airplane parts continued.

===Postwar prosperity===

Connecticut&#x27;s suburbs thrived as people moved to newer housing via subsidized highways, while its cities peaked in the 1950s and then began a slow downhill slide as population spread into widely dispersed regions. Connecticut built the first nuclear-powered submarine, the and other essential weapons for The Pentagon. At the beginning of the 1960s, the increased job market gave the state the highest per capita income in the nation. The increased standard of living could be seen in the various suburban neighborhoods that began to develop outside major cities. Construction of major highways such as the Connecticut Turnpike, subsidized by federal investment, resulted in former small towns becoming sites for large-scale residential and retail development, a trend that continues to this day, with offices also moving to new locations.

Fairfield County, Connecticut&#x27;s Gold Coast, was a favorite residence of many executives who worked in New York City. It attracted scores of corporate headquarters from New York, especially in the 1970s, when Connecticut had no state income tax. Connecticut offered ample inexpensive office space, high quality of life to people who did not want to live in New York City, and excellent public schools. The state did not offer any tax incentives for corporations to move their headquarters.

Connecticut industrial workers were very well-paid, many of them in defense industries building nuclear submarines at Electric Boat shipyards, helicopters at Sikorsky, and jet engines at Pratt &amp; Whitney. Labor unions were very powerful after the war, peaking in clout in the early 1970s. Since then the private sector labor unions have dramatically declined in size and influence with the decline in industry as factories closed and jobs were moved out of state and offshore. The public-sector unions, covering teachers, police, and city and state employees, have become more powerful, with influence in the Democratic Party.

Deindustrialization left many industrial centers with empty factories and mills and high unemployment. As wealthier whites moved to suburbs, African American and Latino made up a higher proportion of urban populations, reflecting their later arrival in the Great Migration and immigration, and relative inability to find and move to other jobs. They had gained middle-class status through good-paying industrial jobs and became stranded. African Americans and Latinos inherited aging urban spaces that were no longer a high priority for the state or private industry. By the 1980s crime and urban blight were major issues. The poor conditions were catalysts for militant movements pushing to gentrify ghettos and desegregate the urban school systems, which were surrounded by majority-white suburbs. In 1987, Hartford became the first United States city to elect an African-American woman as mayor, Carrie Saxon Perry.

====Politics====
Connecticut had very strong state parties, with the GOP led by leaders, such as A. Searle Pinney. John Bailey was the state chairman of the Democrats from 1946 to his death in 1975; he was also the party&#x27;s national chairman, 1961 until 1968. These party leaders controlled their legislative delegations and ran the state conventions that selected nominees for the top offices. The old WASP element was still a factor in rural Connecticut, but Catholics comprised 44% of the state&#x27;s population and dominated all of the industrial cities. With the ethnics loyal to the Democratic Party, and labor unions at their peak, the Democratic Party strongly endorsed the New Deal coalition and its liberalism. The Republican Party was mildly liberal, typified by Senator Prescott Bush, a wealthy Yankee whose son and grandson were later each elected as president from their new conservative base in Texas. Connecticut had some difficulty in projecting its identity, with no big-league sports teams and its media markets dominated by outside television stations in New York, Providence, Rhode Island, and Springfield, Massachusetts. Bailey&#x27;s contact with the liberal element that dominated the Democratic Party was Ella Grasso. He promoted her from the legislature, to Secretary of State, to Congress, and finally to the governorship.

Bailey&#x27;s usual success in dictating the state ticket was upset in 1970, when the Republican gubernatorial candidate, Congressman Thomas Meskill, defeated a lackluster Democrat. More complex was the situation of Senator Thomas Dodd, a Democrat who had been censured by the Senate for his misuse of campaign funds. Dodd lost the Democratic primary, but ran as an independent and split the vote. The result was that liberal Republican Lowell Weicker won the Senate seat with 42% of the vote. Bailey had an easier time in 1974 gaining re-election of Senator Abe Ribicoff. In 1950 Ribicoff was elected as the first Jewish and non-WASP governor in the state&#x27;s history. Weicker was repeatedly reelected until being narrowly defeated in 1988. He was elected governor in 1990 as an independent.

In 1974 Democrats elected as governor Ella T. Grasso, the daughter of Italian immigrants. She was the first woman of any state to be elected governor in her own right. She was reelected in 1978. She faced a major crisis in 1978 when &quot;The Blizzard of 78&quot; dropped 30 inches of snow across the state, crippling highways and making virtually all roads impassible. She &quot;Closed the State&quot; by proclamation, and forbade all use of public roads by businesses and citizens, closing all businesses. Effectively residents were restricted to their homes. This relieved the rescue and cleanup authorities from the need to help the mounting number of stuck cars, and allowed clean-up and emergency services for shut-ins to proceed. The crisis ended on the third day, and Grasso won accolades from all state sectors for her leadership and strength.

===The late 20th century===
Connecticut&#x27;s dependence on the defense industry posed an economic challenge at the end of the Cold War. The resulting budget crisis helped elect Lowell Weicker as Governor on a third party ticket in 1990. Despite campaigning against a state income tax, Weicker&#x27;s remedy to the budget crisis, a state income tax, proved effective in balancing the budget but was politically unpopular. Weicker retired after a single term.

Until the late nineteenth century Connecticut agriculture included tobacco farms. This brought in immigrants from the West Indies, Puerto Rico, and the black South. In the off-season they turned to the cities for temporary apartments, schooling and services, but with the decline of tobacco they moved there permanently.

With newly &quot;reconquered&quot; land, the Pequots initiated plans for the construction of a multimillion-dollar casino complex to be built on reservation land. The Foxwoods Casino was completed in 1992 and the enormous revenue it received made the Mashantucket Pequot Reservation one of the wealthiest in the country. With the newfound money, great educational and cultural initiatives were carried out, including the construction of the Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center. The Mohegan Reservation gained political recognition shortly thereafter and, in 1994, opened another successful casino (Mohegan Sun) near the town of Uncasville. The economic recession that began in 2007 took a heavy toll of receipts, and by 2012 both the Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods were deeply in debt.

Casinos provide an example of the shift in the economy away from manufacturing to entertainment, such as ESPN, financial services, including hedge funds and pharmaceutical firms such as Pfizer.

==21st century==
In the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, 65 state residents were killed. The vast majority were Fairfield County residents who were working in the World Trade Center. Greenwich lost 12 residents, Stamford and Norwalk each lost nine and Darien lost six. A state memorial was later set up at Sherwood Island State Park in Westport. The New York City skyline can be seen from the park.

A number of political scandals rocked Connecticut in the early 21st century. These included the 2003 removal from office of the mayors of Bridgeport, Joseph P. Ganim on 16 corruption charges, as well as Waterbury mayor Philip A. Giordano, who was charged with 18 counts of sexual abuse of two girls.

In 2004, Governor John G. Rowland resigned during a corruption investigation. Rowland later pleads guilty to federal charges, and his successor M. Jodi Rell, focused her administration on reforms in the wake of the Rowland scandal.

In April 2005, Connecticut passed a law that grants all rights of marriage to same-sex couples. However, the law required that such unions be called &quot;civil unions&quot;, and that the title of marriage be limited to those unions whose parties are of the opposite sex. The state was the first to pass a law permitting civil unions without a prior court proceeding. In October 2008, the Supreme Court of Connecticut ordered same-sex marriage legalized.

In July 2009, the Connecticut legislature overrode a veto by Governor M. Jodi Rell to pass SustiNet, the first significant public-option health care reform legislation in the nation.

The state&#x27;s criminal justice system also dealt with the first execution in the state since 1960, the 2005 execution of serial killer Michael Ross and was rocked by the July 2007 home invasion murders in Cheshire. As the accused perpetrators of the Petit murders were out on parole, Governor M. Jodi Rell promised a full investigation into the state&#x27;s criminal justice policies.

On April 11, 2012, the State House of Representatives voted to end the state&#x27;s rarely enforced death penalty; the State Senate having previously passed the measure on April 5. Governor Dannel Malloy announced that &quot;when it gets to my desk I will sign it&quot;. Eleven inmates were on death row at that time, including the two men convicted of the July 2007 Cheshire, Connecticut, home invasion murders. Controversy exists both in that the legislation is not retroactive and does not commute their sentences and that the repeal is against the majority view of the state&#x27;s citizens, as 62% are for retaining it.

In 2011 and 2012, Connecticut was hit by three major storms in the space of just over 14 months, with all three causing extensive property damage and electric outages. Hurricane Irene struck Connecticut on August 28 with the storm blamed for the deaths of three residents. Damage totaled $235 million, including 20 houses that were destroyed in East Haven. Two months later in late October, the so-called &quot;Halloween nor&#x27;easter&quot; dropped extensive snow onto trees in northern Connecticut that still had foliage, resulting in a significant number of snapped branches and trunks that damaged property and power lines, with some areas not seeing electricity restored for 11 days. Hurricane Sandy had tropical-storm-force winds when it reached Connecticut October 29, 2012, with four deaths blamed on the storm. Sandy&#x27;s winds drove storm surges into coastal streets, toppled trees and power lines, and cut power to 98 percent of homes and businesses en route to more than $360 million in damage. Some sections along the southeast coast of Connecticut had no power for more than 16 days.

On December 14, 2012, Adam Lanza shot and killed 26 people, including 20 children and 6 staff, at Sandy Hook Elementary School in the Sandy Hook village of Newtown, Connecticut, and then killed himself.

<doc id="413993" wikidata="Q338243" url="?curid=413993" title="David Atkinson (politician)">
<text>David Anthony Atkinson (24 March 1940 – 23 January 2012) was a British Conservative politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Bournemouth East from a 1977 by-election until he stepped down at the 2005 general election.

==Early life==
Born in Westcliff-on-Sea, Atkinson attended St George&#x27;s College, Weybridge and Southend College of Technology. He later trained at the Chelsea College of Aeronautical and Automobile Engineering in Chelsea where he gained a Diploma in Automobile Engineering and Motor Trade Management. From 1963–72, he was Director of Chalkwell Motor Co. Ltd in Leigh-on-Sea, and from 1973–77 he worked for David Graham Studios Ltd in printing, marketing, artwork and design.

==Parliamentary career==
Atkinson was national chairman of the Young Conservatives from 1970 until 1971, more right-wing than the long line of his moderate predecessors and successors. He contested the Newham North West constituency in February 1974 and Basildon in October 1974.

Atkinson became an MP at the 1977 Bournemouth East by-election, retaining the seat for his party. He served as PPS to Paul Channon and was a vociferous supporter of corporal punishment and was nearly dismissed for voting against the Government in its support.

He supported local causes such as AFC Bournemouth during their financial troubles. Atkinson was vocal in his criticism of the Soviet Union and active in a number of international forums aimed at highlighting communist abuse of human rights. He was less critical of South Africa&#x27;s apartheid regime, calling for the lifting of sanctions and objected to the pressures being placed upon the South African Government.

&quot;The Independent&quot; reported that Atkinson was invited on a visit to South Africa by Strategy Network International, the lobby group fronted by Derek Laud, the ex Monday Club member and protege of Michael Brown: &quot;John Carlile, Mr Colvin and David Atkinson, who led an SNI delegation to observe the Angolan peace process in 1992, a year before the firm closed.&quot;

==Personal life==
Atkinson married Susan Pilsworth in 1968 and divorced in 1992. They had a son and a daughter. He came out as gay and entered into a civil partnership in 2011. His wife discovered he had been in a relationship with footballer Justin Fashanu when Fashanu came out as gay and said he had had an affair with an unnamed, married Conservative MP whom he had met in a London gay bar. After confronting Atkinson, he revealed he was gay and had been in a series of gay relationships.

His son, Anthony, at first accused him of being a sexual predator and said Geoffrey Dickens had stayed at the Atkinson family home. He said he believed his father had been named in the missing Westminster paedophile dossier compiled by Dickens.

Anthony Atkinson later qualified his statement to say his father had not been engaged in activity that equated to the scope and scale of Jimmy Savile&#x27;s alleged activities, saying he had no evidence that his father ever had relations with anyone under-aged.

==Death==
In 2011, Atkinson underwent an operation after he was diagnosed with bowel cancer. He died on 23 January 2012 at the age of 71.

<doc id="413995" wikidata="Q1200029" url="?curid=413995" title="Derek Foster, Baron Foster of Bishop Auckland">
<text>Derek Foster, Baron Foster of Bishop Auckland, (25 June 1937 – 5 January 2019) was a British Labour politician who served as Member of Parliament for Bishop Auckland, in County Durham, from 1979 to 2005.

==Political career==
Foster was first elected to represent Bishop Auckland at the 1979 general election, and held this seat until his retirement in 2005. He served as opposition Chief Whip between 1985 and 1995, becoming a member of the Privy Council in 1993. After Tony Blair became leader in 1994, he was keen to appoint a new Chief Whip and asked Foster to stand aside, in return for the promise of a seat in the Cabinet if and when Labour returned to power. Foster eventually agreed and became Shadow Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in 1995.

However, when Labour won the 1997 election, Foster was appointed to the relatively junior role of Parliamentary Secretary in the Cabinet Office, under David Clark. After giving the matter further thought, Foster stood down from the government after just two days, and later publicly accused Mr Blair of having broken his promise to him. He was eventually appointed chair of the Commons sub-committee on employment, becoming something of a thorn in the Government&#x27;s side during Mr Blair&#x27;s first term. However, the employment sub-committee was abolished in 2001 and he became a backbencher, retiring from the Commons at the 2005 general election.

He was appointed as a deputy lieutenant of County Durham in 2001, giving him the post-nominal letters &quot;DL&quot; for life. On 13 May 2005 it was announced that he would be created a life peer, and in June 2005 the peerage was gazetted as Baron Foster of Bishop Auckland, of Bishop Auckland in the County of Durham. He died from cancer at a hospital in Sunderland on 5 January 2019, at the age of 81.

==Other interests==
Foster was deeply committed to The Salvation Army, serving at the Sunderland Millfield Corps, whilst also a member of the Labour Friends of Israel Policy Council.

<text>Peter Landreth Atkinson (born 19 January 1943) is a British Conservative Party politician. He was the Member of Parliament for Hexham from 1992 until 2010.

==Early life==
Atkinson was educated at Cheltenham College and after leaving school he became a journalist and joined the Newcastle Journal in November 1968. He moved to London to work on the Evening Standard as a reporter, eventually becoming News Editor.

In 1982 he left to join a free newspaper company which grew to fifteen titles. He left to become Deputy Director of the British Field Sports Society with responsibility for political and public affairs.

His political career began in 1978 when he was elected to Wandsworth Council. He left the Council in 1982 and became a member of Wandsworth Health Authority (1982–88) and later a Suffolk County Councillor (1989–1992), until his election as MP for Hexham.

==Parliamentary career==
Atkinson was elected at the 1992 general election for the seat of Hexham with a majority of 13,438. At the 1997 election he was narrowly re-elected with a majority of just 222, but at the 2001 and 2005 elections his majority increased again, to 2,529 and 5,020 respectively.

From 1994-1997 Atkinson was a Parliamentary Private Secretary to a number of ministers in the Conservative government. After 1997 he alternated between serving on the Chairmen&#x27;s Panel and working in the Conservative whips office.

In 1995 Atkinson blocked a Private Members Bill on the live export of veal calves by reading from the London telephone directory in Parliament to use up all the debating time, a technique known as filibustering.

Atkinson is one of the 98 MPs who voted to keep their expense details secret.

On 19 June 2008, Atkinson announced he would not stand at the next general election.

==Personal life==
Atkinson married Brione Darley in 1976 and they have two grown-up daughters.

<text>Max Rudolf (June 15, 1902 — February 28, 1995) was a German conductor and music institute teacher.

Rudolf was born in Frankfurt am Main, where he studied cello, piano, organ and trumpet. He was a composition student of Bernhard Sekles at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt. He held positions in Freiburg as assistant conductor at the Städtisches Theater, and as second conductor at the Hessisches Staatstheater in Darmstadt. In 1929, he became principal conductor of the German Theatre in Prague.

In 1940, Rudolf emigrated to the United States, and took American citizenship in 1945. In 1942, he conducted the Naumburg Orchestral Concerts, in the Naumburg Bandshell, Central Park, in the summer series. He served on the conducting staff of the Metropolitan Opera between 1946 and 1958 and had the title of musical administrator of the company between 1950 and 1958. In 1958, Rudolf became music director of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, and held this post until 1970. He was director of the Cincinnati May Festival from 1963 to 1970. After his tenure in Cincinnati, Rudolf served as conductor of the Dallas Symphony for a season (1973–1974), and artistic advisor of the New Jersey Symphony for the 1976–1977 season.

Rudolf wrote &quot;The Grammar of Conducting&quot;, a widely used text for orchestral conducting which was published in 1950. It was republished with revisions in 1980 and again in 1995. He was head of the opera and conducting department at the Curtis Institute of Music from 1970 to 1973 and returned to the Curtis faculty under emeritus status in 1983, remaining so affiliated until his death.

Rudolf and his wife Liese had two children. His widow, their son William, and their daughter Marianne survived him, as well as five grandchildren and ten great-grandchildren.

<doc id="413998" wikidata="Q338044" url="?curid=413998" title="Denzil Davies">
<text>David John Denzil Davies (9 October 1938 – 10 October 2018) was a Welsh Labour Party politician. He served for 35 years as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Llanelli from 1970 to 2005. He was a Treasury Minister (1975–1979); a member of Labour&#x27;s Shadow Cabinet team (1979–1988); and a member of the Privy Council.

==Early life==
The son of a colliery blacksmith, Denzil Davies was born and brought up in Cynwyl Elfed, in rural Carmarthenshire. From his childhood in this Welsh-speaking area, Davies spoke Welsh fluently. He attended Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Grammar School for Boys in Carmarthen, and then Pembroke College, Oxford, where he graduated with a First Class Honours BA in Law and Gray&#x27;s Inn where he qualified as a barrister. He lectured in Law at the University of Chicago in 1963 and the University of Leeds from 1964. He practised at the tax bar between 1967 and 1975. Later he also practised in the field of personal injuries and served as a head of chambers.

==Parliamentary career==
Davies unsuccessfully sought the Labour nomination for the 1966 Carmarthen by-election, losing out to Gwilym Prys-Davies.

Davies was elected in the 1970 general election as the Member of Parliament for Llanelli, following Jim Griffiths.

From June 1975 to May 1979, he was a Treasury Minister in the Labour Government first of Harold Wilson and then of James Callaghan. 

A Eurosceptic, Davies campaigned against Britain&#x27;s entry into the EEC. 

He was a supporter of Welsh devolution in the 1979 Referendum. In 1997, he was a strong critic of the Labour Government&#x27;s plans for limited devolution for Wales, challenging them as inadequate and undemocratic.

Davies served in a number of posts when Labour formed the Official Opposition after the election of Margaret Thatcher in 1979, including Shadow Secretary of State for Wales in Michael Foot&#x27;s Shadow Cabinet and Shadow Secretary of State for Defence in Neil Kinnock&#x27;s. He was popular among Labour MPs, and was regularly elected to the Shadow Cabinet without being part of any factional “slate” and without any organised campaign: in 1986 he reached third place in the Shadow Cabinet ballot. 

Like his predecessor as Shadow Defence Secretary, John Silkin, he resigned from the front bench in June 1988 in protest at Neil Kinnock&#x27;s management style. The trigger for his resignation was Kinnock&#x27;s announcement, without reference to Davies or the Shadow Cabinet, of a change in Labour&#x27;s defence policy, from unilateral nuclear disarmament to multilateral nuclear disarmament and then back to unilateral nuclear disarmament, over a period of three days. He made an unsuccessful bid for the Labour Party deputy leadership in 1983.

Davies was one of the few Labour MPs with ministerial experience at the time of the 1997 landslide that returned the party to power after 18 years in opposition. However, he was not included in any of the governments formed by Tony Blair. As a backbencher Davies continued to oppose Britain&#x27;s membership of the EU. 

In March 2003, he was one of the Labour MPs who voted against the Iraq War.

He stood down at the 2005 general election, and was succeeded by Nia Griffith. He died on 10 October 2018.

==Personal life==
He married Mary Ann Finlay in 1963. They had a son and daughter. They divorced in 1988. He married Ann Carlton in 1989.

<doc id="414002" wikidata="Q2533656" url="?curid=414002" title="Koch (boat)">
<text>The koch () was a special type of small one- or two-mast wooden sailing ships designed and used in Russia for transpolar voyages in ice conditions of the Arctic seas, popular among the Pomors.

Because of its additional skin-planking (called &quot;kotsa&quot;) and Arctic design of the body and the rudder, it could sail without being damaged in the waters full of ice blocks and ice floes. The koch was the unique ship of this class for several centuries.

==Development==
The development of koch began in the 11th century, when the White Sea shores began to be settled. This type of ship was in wide use during the heyday of Russian polar navigation in the 15th and 16th centuries. There is documentary proof that in those days the private Russian civil fleet in the Arctic seas numbered up to 7,400 small ships in a single year. In the 17th century, kochs were widely used on Siberian rivers during the Russian exploration and conquest of Siberia and the Far East. In 1715, during the Great Northern War, the Russian Arctic shipbuilding and navigation were undermined by the &quot;ukase&quot; (decree) of Tsar Peter the Great. According to the ukase, only &quot;novomanerniye&quot; (&quot;new-mannered&quot;) vessels could be built, that is the civil ships, which could also be used for military purposes. The koch with its special anti-icebound features did not suit this aim.

In the 19th century the anti-ice floe protective features of koch were adopted to the first modern icebreakers, and in fact koch may be regarded as the most ancient form of icebreaker, though wooden and relatively small.

==Construction==
The koches were traditionally built shell-first, with overlapping planks, following the once-widespread Northern European clinker shipbuilding tradition. Iron rivets and brackets, as long as shrub branches or tree roots, were used to fasten the planks to each other. Ribs were inserted into the hull once the shell of planking was assembled. As these ships were in use as late as early 17th century, this may be by far the last use of the clinker technology on large sea-going vessels. They were flat-bottomed, but there is no reliable information whether the bottom was carvel built, as on the cogs, or clinker built, as on Viking ships (the latter is more likely, as the more recent Pomor boats are entirely clinker-built).

The keel length of koch was about 10–25 meters (about 30–70 feet). It had 13 combination ribs, each consisting of several details. The keel was also a combination of several parts. Bulkheads divided the body into several cross-section compartments. Each compartment (&quot;cherdak&quot;) served a specific purpose. There invariably were the fore-part compartment used as the crew&#x27;s quarters, the stern cabin for the captain, and the cargo hold amidships. The koch had a flat deck. A typical koch carried one square sail on one mast. A distinctive peculiarity of the koch was the relatively big size of its square rudder fin which compensated for the special extra-slim design of the upper part of the rudder. This type of ship had two main anchors and, very often, light anchors. Naval historians think that the light anchors could have been used for mooring kochs to the edge of the ice fields.

Special Arctic design features included the rounded lines of the ship&#x27;s body below the water line, an additional belt of ice-floe resistant flush skin-planking (made of oak or larch) along the variable water-line, a false keel for on-ice portage (and for damage prevention from running aground in shallow waters), and the shaft-like upper part and wide lower part (below water-line) of the rudder. Another Arctic feature was the invariable presence aboard any koch of two or more iceboats and of a windlass with anchor rope. Each iceboat had the cargo capacity of 1.5 to 2.0 metric tons (3,300 to 4,400 lb) and was equipped with long runners () for portage on ice. If a koch became trapped in the ice, its rounded bodylines below the water-line would allow for the ship, squeezed by the ice-fields, to be pushed up out of the water and onto the ice with no damage to the body.
Besides the anti-icebound equipment, the captains of kochs had the traditional set of navigation instruments, including a sundial and a magnetic compass with floating &quot;vetromet&quot; (&quot;wind-marker&quot;, a wooden 32-point compass rose with 16 major winds). Other tools and means of navigation were the detailed charts and sailing directions, the stars, and the pilot&#x27;s marks on the familiar shores.

==Classification==
There are two main classifications of koch subtypes. The first, a mixed classification, distinguishes between three subtypes of kochs depending on both their place of origin (Siberian and Mangazeyan) and their sea-worthiness (&quot;morskiye&quot;, that is &quot;seafaring&quot;). The second classification does not pay any attention to minor shipbuilding differences and divides all kochs into two categories according to the main spheres of their maritime operations: river/sea, and &quot;morskiye&quot; (seafaring) for long-range sea voyages.

The following is added from Fisher. He claims that the koch had a square sail and only one mast. The largest koches were 60 feet long and 20 feet wide(sic), with a draft of 5 or 6 feet and a crew of 6 to 12. They could hold up to 40 people or 45 tonnes of cargo. They were oval when viewed from the top or side. The flat or rounded bottom made them maneuverable when dodging ice floes, but probably unstable in a severe storm. The square sail and flat bottom meant that they would not sail well without a following wind.

Other boat types used in Siberia include the shitik and the baidarka.

<text>Bruce Thomas George (1 June 1942 – 24 February 2020) was a British Labour Party politician, who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Walsall South from February 1974 until 2010.

==Early life==
George was born in Mountain Ash, Mid-Glamorgan, to Phyllis George and her husband Edgar George, a policeman. He was educated at the Mountain Ash Grammar School and the University of Wales, Swansea, where he was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree in political theory and government. He finished his education at the University of Warwick where he earned a master&#x27;s degree in comparative politics. He was an assistant lecturer in social studies at the Glamorgan Polytechnic from 1964 to 1966. He lectured in politics at the Manchester Polytechnic from 1968 until he became a senior politics lecturer at the Birmingham Polytechnic in 1970. He left this post when he was elected to Parliament in 1974. He was also a tutor with the Open University from 1970 until 1973.

==Parliamentary career==
George contested Southport at the 1970 general election but was defeated by the sitting Conservative MP, Ian Percival, coming third in the poll. He was elected to the House of Commons for Walsall South at the February 1974 general election.

George served as a member of the House of Commons Defence Select Committee from 1979 until 2005, serving as chairman of the committee from 1998 to 2005. He became a member of the Privy Council in 2000.

Although he was an MP for 36 years, George was never on the frontbench. He is seen as a supporter of NATO and a strong military. He was Leader of the UK Delegation to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly and was elected vice-president of the Assembly in November 2007. In 2002, he was elected president of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and was re-elected in 2003. Between 2004 and June 2006, he served as President Emeritus and Special Advisor on Mediterranean Affairs. He also regularly acted as an election monitor, especially in disputed Presidential elections in Ukraine and Georgia.

On 18 February 2010, George announced that he would stand down at the 2010 general election. He was succeeded in his constituency by Valerie Vaz.

==After the House of Commons==
In May 2011, George was awarded the Medal of Honour by the president of Georgia for his considerable contribution to the democratisation of that country. In October 2011, he was made an Honorary Freeman of the Borough by Walsall Council in recognition of his 36 years&#x27; service as Member of Parliament for Walsall South. In 2012, he was awarded the OSCE Medal in recognition of his contribution to the work of the OSCE before, during and after his presidency of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.

==Personal life and death==
George married Lisa Toelle in 1992.

George was an honorary political advisor to The Royal British Legion and vice-president of the UK&#x27;s largest professional security organisation, The Security Institute.

In 1981, he was a visiting lecturer at the University of Essex and later a visiting professor at the University of Portsmouth, Institute of Criminal Justice Studies.

George was a supporter of Walsall F.C.

On 24 February 2020, George died due to complications of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in London, at the age of 77.

<text>John Eric Austin (born 21 August 1944), formerly Austin-Walker, is a British Labour Party politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Woolwich from 1992 to 1997 and for Erith and Thamesmead from 1997 to 2010.

==Early life==
He attended the Glyn Grammar School for Boys (now called Glyn School) on The Kingsway in Epsom. Austin gained a Certificate in Community and Youth Work from Goldsmiths College in 1972 and a Master of Arts in Policy Studies from the University of Bristol in 1990. He worked as a medical laboratory technician from 1961 to 1963, a Labour Party organiser from 1963 to 1970, a social worker in Bexley from 1972 to 1974 before becoming Director of Bexley Council for Racial Equality until 1992.

Austin became a councillor for the London Borough of Greenwich in 1970, and was leader of the council from 1982 to 1987, when he became mayor for two years. He stepped down as a councillor in 1994.

==Parliamentary career==
Austin stood for the seat of Woolwich at the 1992 general election, and won it from independent John Cartwright with a majority of 2,225. The constituency boundaries for the area were re-drawn for 1997 general election, and Austin won the new seat of Erith and Thamesmead with a majority of 17,424.

Austin served as a member of the Health Select Committee from 1994 until 2005. He served on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights.

In May 2005 Austin threatened to stand as a stalking horse candidate against Tony Blair. He intended to trigger a leadership election at the party conference in September 2005 if Blair himself did not do so by resigning as leader. He indicated his hope that, in the event of a contest, Gordon Brown would enter and win. However he was unable to accumulate the number of required nominations from fellow MPs to force a contest.

Austin, a member of the left-wing Socialist Campaign Group, announced his retirement in July 2008. He told a meeting of the General Council of the Erith &amp; Thamesmead Constituency Labour Party that he would not run again at the next general election.

Austin was implicated in the 2009 MPs&#x27; expenses scandal, he claimed a total of £133,000 in second home allowances since 2001, despite the fact the two London flats he lived in over the period were just over 10 miles away from his main residence in Kent. However Austin has said his claims had been reasonable and within the rules.

He is a patron of various organisations including Humanists UK (formerly known as the British Humanist Association), Peace in Kurdistan Campaign and Palestine Solidarity Campaign.

==Personal life==
Austin lists his interests as running, cookery, and gardening. He married Linda in 1965. They have two sons Damien and Toby and a daughter Zoe, and divorced in 1988. Zoe gave him three grandchildren, Felix, Matilda and Kitty. Toby has given him three grandsons and a granddaughter, Jake, Cameron, Ziggy and Daisy. Damien has two sons, Shay and Osin.

On 15 September 2010, Austin, along with 54 other public figures, signed an open letter published in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, stating their opposition to Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s state visit to the UK.

<doc id="414007" wikidata="Q478442" url="?curid=414007" title="Alan Haselhurst, Baron Haselhurst">
<text>Alan Gordon Barraclough Haselhurst, Baron Haselhurst, (born 23 June 1937), is a former British Conservative Party politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Saffron Walden from 1977 to 2017, having previously represented Middleton and Prestwich from 1970 to February 1974. Haselhurst was Chairman of Ways and Means from 14 May 1997 to 8 June 2010, and later Chairman of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association between 2011 and 2014. 

The oldest Conservative Member of Parliament to stand down at the 2017 general election, being succeeded as MP for Saffron Walden by Kemi Badenoch, he was created a Life Peer on 22 June 2018, taking his seat in the House of Lords as Baron Haselhurst.

==Early life and career==

Haselhurst was born at South Elmsall, near Hemsworth, Yorkshire, and educated at King Edward&#x27;s School, Birmingham, then Cheltenham College in Gloucestershire, before going up to Oriel College, Oxford.

Elected President of the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1958, for two years, he also served as Secretary and Treasurer of the Oxford Union from 1959. Before his election to parliament, Haselhurst worked in management in the chemicals industry and became an unremunerated director when his father&#x27;s pharmacy was incorporated.

Haselhurst was the election agent to Robin [Lord] Balniel, Conservative MP for Hertford, at both the 1964 and 1966 general elections. Haselhurst was elected Chairman of the National Young Conservatives in 1964, serving for two years, later becoming Chairman of the Commonwealth Youth Exchange Council (1978–81).

==Parliamentary career==
===1970–1997===
Haselhurst was elected to the House of Commons at the 1970 general election for the Lancashire seat of Middleton and Prestwich, defeating the sitting Labour MP Denis Coe by 1,042 votes. In parliament, he briefly served from 1973 as Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Home Secretary Robert Carr, before losing his seat in February 1974. Haselhurst lost the seat to Labour by only 517 votes; he then served as the Chairman of the Manchester Youth and Community Service from 1974 until 1977 upon re-entering the Commons; the Conservative MP for the Essex seat of Saffron Walden, Sir Peter Kirk, died on 17 April 1977. Selected to contest the resulting by-election on 7 July, Haselhurst retained the seat for the Conservatives with an increased majority of 12,437, and was returned to Parliament as its MP at every subsequent election until his retirement in 2017.

Following the Conservatives&#x27; return to power at the 1979 general election, Haselhurst was appointed as PPS to the Secretary of State for Education and Science Mark Carlisle serving for two years from 1979. He served on the European Legislation Select Committee for fifteen years from 1982, and was a member of the Transport Select Committee from 1992 to 1997. He was given the privilege of asking the first question in Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s final Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions on 27 November 1990.

===1997–2017===
Following the 1997 general election, Haselhurst was elected Chairman of Ways and Means (Deputy Speaker), remaining in post under successive Speakers Betty Boothroyd, Michael Martin, and John Bercow until May 2010. Haselhurst was a nominated candidate to succeed Michael Martin after Martin&#x27;s resignation as Commons Speaker on 19 May 2009. However, Haselhurst was among those who became embroiled in the MPs&#x27; expenses controversy being highlighted by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; for claiming £12,000 in gardening expenses over four years, in the sum of £249 every month, despite naïvely taking advice from the Fees Office to simplify the submission of his expenses in this way; he made endeavours to wipe the slate clean by refunding these gardening expenses &quot;out of respect to his constituents&quot;, withdrawing from the Commons Speakership election having received 66 votes in the first round of voting, and 57 in the second.

Haselhurst chose not to seek re-election as a Commons Deputy Speaker after the 2010 general election, since, by convention, the Chairman of Ways and Means should come from a different party affiliation than that of the Speaker, he would only have been eligible to stand for First Deputy Chairman, junior to his previous office. Nevertheless, his fellow parliamentarians entrusted him to continue as Interim Deputy Speaker chairing debates in the House of Commons during the period between the State Opening of Parliament and its election of new Deputy Speakers. On 27 July 2010, Haselhurst was elected Chairman of the House of Commons Administration Committee, having been defeated in the election for Chairman of the Backbench Business Committee by Natascha Engel.

In July 2010, Haselhurst became Chairman of the UK Commonwealth Parliamentary Association then, in the following year at the Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference at London in July 2011, being elected Chairman of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association&#x27;s Executive Committee, serving until October 2014, and overseeing parliamentary procedure throughout the Commonwealth. He succeeded the Malaysian Datuk Seri Haji Shafie Apdal; the previous British parliamentarian elected to this post had been Sir Colin Shepherd in 1996.

Reselected as the Conservative Party candidate for the next election at a meeting of the local party association on 13 February 2014, Haselhurst was again returned to Parliament at the 2015 general election. 

A staunch opponent of Brexit at the 2016 referendum, in April 2017, Haselhurst announced that he would not be contesting the 2017 general election, having initially indicated his intention to stand. About his change of mind he commented: &quot;I feel now that my initial instinctive response was premature... I have begun to recognize that it might test the friendship and goodwill of so many people whose support I have enjoyed if I sought to do so for a further five years!&quot;

A supporter of community-based projects he was for a time a Director of Turning Point, a charity working with socially-excluded young people. A europhile and ally of Kenneth Clarke, Lord Haselhurst has for a long time been regarded as a one-nation Conservative.

===House of Lords===
Nominated for elevation to the peerage on 18 May 2018, he was created by Letters Patent on 22 June, Baron Haselhurst, &quot;of Saffron Walden in the County of Essex&quot;, before being introduced to the Upper House to sit on the Conservative benches.

Lord Haselhurst retired from active politics in the House of Lords on 20 December 2024.

==Honours==
* UK Baron (2018)
* Knight Bachelor (1995)

==Personal life==
Married to Angela Margaret Bailey on 16 April 1977, Lord and Lady Haselhurst live in Essex, having two sons and a daughter.

Knighted in 1995, Haselhurst was sworn of the Privy Council in 1999. 

Having served as Secretary to the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Cricket and as a Council Member of Essex County Cricket Club from 1996 to 2008, Lord Haselhurst is also a member of Marylebone Cricket Club and well known for his writings about the &quot;Outcasts Cricket Club&quot;.

<text>David Philip Heathcoat-Amory (born 21 March 1949) is a British politician, accountant, and farmer. He was the Conservative Member of Parliament for Wells from 1983 until he lost the seat in the 2010 general election. He became a member of the British Privy Council in 1996. Heathcoat-Amory was previously Chair of the European Research Group.

==Education and professional life==
David Heathcoat-Amory is the son of British Army Brigadier Roderick Heathcoat-Amory, MC (son of Sir Ian Heathcoat-Amory, 2nd Baronet) and the nephew of Harold Macmillan&#x27;s Chancellor of the Exchequer Derick Heathcoat-Amory. He was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, University of Oxford, where he received an MA in PPE. He was President of the Oxford University Conservative Association.

Heathcoat-Amory qualified as an accountant in 1974 and joined Price Waterhouse as a chartered accountant. In 1980, he was appointed as the assistant finance director of the British Technology Group (BTG) where he remained until he was elected to Parliament in 1983.

==Political career==
Heathcoat-Amory contested the London Borough of Brent seat at Brent South at the 1979 general election but was defeated by the sitting Labour MP Laurence Pavitt by 11,616 votes. He was elected to the House of Commons at the 1983 general election for the Somerset seat of Wells, whose sitting MP Robert Boscawen had decided to move to Somerton and Frome following boundary changes. He held the seat with a majority of 6,575.

In Parliament, he was appointed as the Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Financial Secretary to the Treasury John Moore in 1985, and was also the PPS to his successor from 1986 Norman Lamont. Following the 1987 general election he became the PPS to the Home Secretary Douglas Hurd until he was promoted to the government of Margaret Thatcher as an Assistant Government Whip in 1988. He was promoted to become a Lord Commissioner to the Treasury and Government Whip in 1989. Later in the year he became the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department for the Environment, until moved by the new prime minister John Major in the same position at the Department of Energy in 1990. He was appointed as the Treasurer of the Household (Deputy Chief Whip) following the 1992 general election and was the Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in 1993. He was appointed as the Paymaster General in 1994 where he served until resigning from the government in 1996 over the single European currency. He became a member of the Privy Council in 1996.

In 1997 Heathcoat-Amory joined the shadow cabinet of William Hague as the Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, and was the Shadow Secretary of State for Trade and Industry from 2000. He left the frontbench on the election of Iain Duncan Smith as the leader of the Conservative Party in 2001. He was a member of the Treasury Select committee from 2004 until he was briefly, in 2005, a spokesman on work and pensions under the leadership of Michael Howard, but returned to the backbenches later in the year when David Cameron became Conservative leader. He served as the chairman of the all party group on the British Museum; the vice chair of the group on astronomy and space environment; and the secretary of the group on boxing.

From late 2001 until July 2003, Heathcoat-Amory was one of the two British parliamentary delegates to the Convention on the Future of Europe, which drafted the European Constitution. He is well known for his strong euroscepticism and was, through the work of the Convention, a fierce opponent of the official drafts being prepared by the presidium of the Convention, criticising them as being too federalist.

Heathcoat-Amory was selected by the Power 2010 democracy and constitutional reform campaign as one of six MPs accused of &quot;failing our democracy&quot; and who &quot;stand in the way of a reforming Parliament&quot;. Heathcoat-Amory lost his seat in the 2010 general election to the Liberal Democrat&#x27;s Tessa Munt who achieved a 6.1% swing.

At the election, UKIP&#x27;s Jake Baynes was requested by his party to stand down owing to UKIP&#x27;s policy of not standing a candidate in a constituency where there is already a committed eurosceptic, but he refused to do so. In interviews, Baynes said he was &quot;offering the public a service no other candidate is&quot;. Heathcoat-Amory partly blamed the presence of a UKIP candidate on the ballot paper for his defeat during his speech after the result of the ballot was announced. He also admitted that his involvement in the expenses scandal played a part in his defeat.

He was criticised in 2008 after remarking, regarding the presence of a Black MP, Dawn Butler, &quot;They&#x27;re letting anybody in nowadays&quot;. Heathcoat-Amory denied the accusation that his remarks were racist.

Having lost by a relatively narrow 800 votes in the General Election in June 2010, Heathcoat-Amory announced to the local party members and media that he would not be contesting the next general election.

==Expenses claims==
On 12 May 2009, it was reported in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; that Heathcoat-Amory had charged the taxpayer for manure costing £380 over 3 years on expenses, under the controversial Additional Costs Allowance. In February 2010 it was revealed that he had been asked to repay a total of £29,691.93. &quot;The Times&quot; dubbed the scandal &#x27;The Manure Parliament&#x27; when singling out Heathcoat-Amory&#x27;s claim.

==Personal life==
He enjoys angling, growing trees, gardening and astronomy. He married Linda Adams on 4 February 1978 in north Hampshire. The couple lives on an estate in west London with a significant art collection. They have a son, John, and a daughter, Florence (born September 1988). His younger son, Matthew, took his own life at their second home in Perthshire in 2001. Heathcoat-Amory and his wife Linda said the family was &quot;deeply shocked&quot;.

<text>The German Geophysical Society (, DGG) is a german scientific association with the aim of promoting geophysics in research, teaching and application. It was founded in Leipzig in 1922 on the initiative of seismology professor Emil Wiechert, initially under the name &quot;German Seismological Society&quot;. It was renamed to its current name at the annual conference in 1924.

In addition to promoting geophysical knowledge in research, teaching and application, its main tasks include geophysical public relations work, cooperation with neighboring disciplines and the promotion of young scientists. The society represents German geophysics in national and international committees and gives out various awards.

Its former role as the official representative of Germany in the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics was transferred to the &quot;National Committee for Geodesy and Geophysics&quot;, which was founded around 1970.

Most members are professional geophysicists; however, everybody who supports the aims of the society can become a member. Membership is terminated by resignation at the end of the calendar, in justified cases, members can be voted out by the board.

<text>Jessurun James Oppenheimer (November 11, 1913 – December 27, 1988) was an American radio and television writer, producer, and director. He was the producer and head writer of the CBS sitcom &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;.

Lucille Ball called Oppenheimer “the brains” behind &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;. As series creator, producer, and head writer, “Jess was the creative force behind the ‘Lucy’ show,” according to &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; director William Asher. “He was the field general. Jess presided over all the meetings, and ran the whole show. He was very sharp.”

==Early life and education==
He was born into a secular Jewish family in
San Francisco, where in the third grade he was chosen as a subject of Stanford University professor Lewis Terman&#x27;s study of gifted children. Prof. Terman&#x27;s assistant noted in Oppenheimer&#x27;s file, &quot;I could detect no signs of a sense of humor.&quot;

During his junior year at Stanford during the 1930s, Oppenheimer visited the studios of radio station KFRC in San Francisco, and soon started spending all his spare time there. He made his broadcast debut performing a comedy sketch he&#x27;d written on the station&#x27;s popular coast-to-coast comedy-variety radio program, &quot;Blue Monday Jamboree&quot;.

==Career==
In 1936, Oppenheimer moved to Hollywood, where in his first week he was hired as a comedy writer on Fred Astaire&#x27;s radio program. When Astaire&#x27;s show ended the following year, Oppenheimer landed a job as a radio gag writer for Jack Benny. He later wrote comedy for such other variety programs as the &quot;Chase and Sanborn Hour with Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy,&quot; &quot;The Lifebuoy Program starring Al Jolson,&quot; &quot;The Gulf Screen Guild Show,&quot; and &quot;The Rudy Vallee Program.&quot; As a staff writer on those programs, Oppenheimer wrote sketch comedy for many Hollywood stars, including Fanny Brice, George Burns and Gracie Allen, Bing Crosby, Marlene Dietrich, Judy Garland, Bob Hope, and Ginger Rogers.

With the start of World War II, Oppenheimer joined the United States Coast Guard and was posted to the Public Relations Department. The sailor at the next desk was a young agent named Ray Stark, the son-in-law of Fanny Brice. Stark immediately hired Oppenheimer to write for the popular radio program, &quot;The Baby Snooks Show&quot;, which starred Brice as a wise-beyond-her-years little girl who constantly drove her daddy crazy.

In 1948, shortly after &quot;The Baby Snooks Show&quot; went off the air, CBS asked Oppenheimer to write a script for a new unsponsored radio sitcom, &quot;My Favorite Husband&quot;, starring Lucille Ball. In the handful of episodes that had already aired, Ball had played &quot;Liz Cugat,&quot; a &quot;gay, sophisticated,&quot; socialite wife of a bank vice president.

Oppenheimer decided to make her radio character more like Baby Snooks: less sophisticated, more childlike, scheming, and impulsive—taking Lucy and the show in a new direction, with broad, slapstick comedy. The show was a huge success. CBS quickly signed Oppenheimer as the show&#x27;s head writer, producer, and director. Oppenheimer was hesitant to accept the position after being warned by his friends against working with Ball, but he decided to accept anyway after seeing her brilliant performance of his script. Soon the series gained both a sponsor and a much larger audience. &quot;My Favorite Husband&quot; also marked the beginning of Oppenheimer&#x27;s successful collaboration with future &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; writers Madelyn Pugh and Bob Carroll, Jr.

In December 1950, when CBS agreed to produce a TV pilot starring Lucille Ball and her husband, Desi Arnaz, Lucy insisted on Oppenheimer to head up the project. But with a completed pilot due in just a few weeks, nobody knew what the series should be about. &quot;Why don&#x27;t we do a show,&quot; Oppenheimer suggested, &quot;about a middle-class working stiff who works very hard at his job as a bandleader, and likes nothing better than to come home at night and relax with his wife, who doesn&#x27;t like staying home and is dying to get into show business herself?&quot; He decided to call the show &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;.

He remained as producer and head writer of the series for five of its six seasons, writing the pilot and 153 episodes with Madelyn Pugh and Bob Carroll Jr. (joined in the fall of 1955 by writers Bob Schiller and Bob Weiskopf). Oppenheimer appeared on the show in Episode #6 (&quot;The Audition&quot;), as one of the three unimpressed TV executives for whom Ricky performs at the Tropicana.

Oppenheimer left &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; in 1956 to take an executive post at NBC, where he produced a series of TV specials, including the &quot;General Motors 50th Anniversary Show&quot; (1957), &quot;Ford Startime&quot; (1959), &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (1959), and the &quot;1959 Emmy Awards&quot;. Oppenheimer and Ball were reunited in 1962 when he produced &quot;The Danny Kaye Show with Lucille Ball&quot;, which was nominated as &#x27;Program of the Year&#x27; by the TV Academy, and again in 1964, when he executive produced &quot;The Lucille Ball Comedy Hour&quot; with Bob Hope.

In the 1960s Oppenheimer created and produced three short-lived sitcoms: &quot;Angel&quot; (1960–61), starring Annie Fargé and Marshall Thompson, &quot;Glynis&quot; (1963–64), starring Glynis Johns, and &quot;The Debbie Reynolds Show&quot; (1969–70). His other TV credits included writing &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot;, producing &quot;Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre&quot;, and writing, producing, and directing a portion of the 1967-68 season of &quot;Get Smart&quot;, starring Don Adams. Oppenheimer received two Emmy Awards and seven other Emmy nominations, a Sylvania Award, and the Writers&#x27; Guild of America&#x27;s Paddy Chayefsky Laurel Award for Screenwriting Achievement.

===Lawsuit===
Oppenheimer was not involved with &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;, Ball&#x27;s 1962 return to television. He claimed that in that show her new character, Lucy Carmichael, was essentially the Lucy Ricardo character he had created. He received a financial settlement and storylines were changed, but this ended his relationship with Ball. 

==Personal life ==
Oppenheimer met his future wife, Estelle (née Weiss), in 1942 while she was working as the manager of the Popular Records Department at Wallichs Music City, on the corner of Sunset and Vine in Hollywood. After a long courtship, the two married on August 5, 1947. Thirteen months later their daughter, Joanne, was born. Their son, Gregg, was born March 8, 1951.

Oppenheimer was also an inventor, holding 18 patents covering a variety of devices, including the in-the-lens teleprompter, first used on television by Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz for a filmed Philip Morris cigarette commercial which aired on &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; on December 14, 1953.

==Death and legacy==
Oppenheimer died of heart failure on December 27, 1988, following complications after being hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles for intestinal surgery. He was survived by his wife, Estelle, his son, Gregg, and his daughter, Jo Oppenheimer Davis. His wife, Estelle, died on December 23, 2007, at the age of 85; she was survived by their children, two grandchildren, and three great grandchildren. Upon his death Lucille Ball called Jess Oppenheimer &quot;a true genius,&quot; adding, &quot;I owe so much to his creativity and his friendship.&quot; His memoir, &quot;Laughs, Luck...and Lucy: How I Came to Create the Most Popular Sitcom of All Time&quot;, was completed after his death by his son, Gregg Oppenheimer. That memoir inspired the younger Oppenheimer to write the play &quot;I Love Lucy: A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Sitcom&quot;, which had its world premiere in Los Angeles on July 12, 2018, starring Seamus Dever as Oppenheimer, Sarah Drew as Lucille Ball, and Oscar Nuñez as Desi Arnaz. The play was recorded in front of a live audience for nationwide public radio broadcast and online distribution. BBC Radio 4 broadcast a serialized version of the play in the UK in August 2020, as &quot;LUCY LOVES DESI: A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Sitcom,&quot; starring Jared Harris as Oppenheimer, Anne Heche as Lucille Ball, Wilmer Valderrama as Desi Arnaz, Stacy Keach as William Frawley, and Alfred Molina as CBS Executive Harry Ackerman. In January 2023, L.A. Theatre Works mounted a 22-city U.S. national tour of the play as &quot;LUCY LOVES DESI: A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Sitcom. In November 2023, Next Stage Press published the play&#x27;s script, making performance licenses available to schools, community theatre groups, and local theatre companies.

In the 1991 television movie &quot;Lucy &amp; Desi: Before the Laughter&quot;, Oppenheimer is portrayed by Howard Schechter. In the 2021 Aaron Sorkin film &quot;Being the Ricardos,&quot; Oppenheimer is portrayed as head writer and producer of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; by Tony Hale, and as an older man by John Rubinstein.
Oppenheimer is memorialized in the Lucille Ball Desi Arnaz Museum &amp; Center for Comedy in Jamestown, New York.

<doc id="414016" wikidata="Q6406574" url="?curid=414016" title="Kilbourne Hole">
<text>Kilbourne Hole is a maar volcanic crater, located west of the Franklin Mountains of El Paso, Texas, in the Potrillo volcanic field of Doña Ana County, New Mexico. Another maar, Hunt&#x27;s Hole, lies just south. Kilbourne Hole is notable for the large number of mantle xenoliths (solid fragments of mantle rock) that were carried to the surface by the eruption.

Estimates of the age of the crater vary from about 24,000 to about 80,000 years.

In 1975, Kilbourne Hole was designated as a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service. It is now part of Organ Mountains–Desert Peaks National Monument.

==Geologic setting and formation==
Kilbourne Hole and Hunt&#x27;s Hole are found in the central part of the Potrillo volcanic field, which also contains the Afton-Aden basalt flows. The area is part of the Rio Grande rift, where the Earth&#x27;s crust is being stretched and thinned. The rift is characterized by deep sedimentary basins, recent faulting and volcanic activity, and unusually high heat flow upwards from the Earth&#x27;s mantle. Kilbourne Hole and Hunt&#x27;s Hole are located on the same north-trending fault of the Fitzgerald-Robledo fault system.

A maar forms when rising magma encounters sediment beds saturated with groundwater. The magma heats the groundwater to the point where the vapor pressure overcomes the weight of the overlying beds (the overburden pressure) and the beds are catastrophically blown out. Country rock is fragmented and expelled into the atmosphere together with fragments of the magma, creating a deep crater, the bottom of which sits below the pre-eruptive ground surface. The eruption that is attributed with the formation of the maar depression was dated to around 20,000 years. As a result of the eruption, the maar also experienced a collapse similar to that of a caldera.

Kilbourne Hole erupted through alluvium (unconsolidated water-deposited sediments), the Camp Rice Formation and through the pre-existing Afton basalt flow. Like most maars, it has a shallow rim, composed of erupted material that was deposited as thin pyroclastic surge deposits.

==Characteristics==
The crater is at an elevation of . It has a diameter of and a depth of .

The hole is over a mile wide, and over deep, with crumbling cliffs all around except at the southwest corner. The rim cliffs, measuring about in height, are composed of basalt and exhibit clear columnar jointing (a feature common to many basalt cliffs, including those of Devils Postpile National Monument near Yosemite National Park and Moses Coulee in the Channeled Scablands of Washington), with characteristic reddish-purple, polygonal (mostly hexagonal) columns. The base of the cliffs is obscured by scree composed of blocks of basalt that have been dislodged from the columns above by the work of erosion and mechanical weathering. The basalt flow that comprises these columns pinches out (thins) and eventually disappears as it approaches the southwestern rim of the maar.
The eastern and northern rim of the hole have low rim deposits of ejecta from the maar eruptions. These rest on the basalt flow where it is present or on older sediments. The ejecta at Kilbourne Hole contains dropstones launched as bombs, usually greater than 2.5 inches across and a large number of xenoliths derived from the lower crust and mantle. These have been closely studied by geologists to learn more about geologic processes deep underground.

Hunt&#x27;s Hole is a little smaller, with basalt cliffs only at the northeast and southeast sides of the crater. Layers of ashfall and crumbling sediment also rise about high, on the south rim of the crater. Sand dunes have collected on the east sides of both craters, rising about above the desert floor. A dry lakebed lies on the floor of each crater.

==Xenoliths==
Kilbourne Hole is notable for the abundance of xenoliths in the crater ejecta. These are fragments of country rock carried intact to the surface by the eruption. Xenoliths at Kilbourne Hole include both upper mantle rocks and lower crustal rocks and are most abundant in the northern and eastern rim. Because these are samples of portions of the Earth that are inaccessible by mining or drilling, they are of great scientific interest.

Most of the mantle xenoliths at Kilbourne Hole are composed of lherzolite, a rock composed mostly of olivine and pyroxene. The olivine has a distinctive pale green color in which the pyroxene forms black flecks. Wehrlite is occasionally found here as well.

Deep crustal rocks include a variety of granulites of both high-silica (felsic) and low-silica (mafic) compositions, mostly charnockite and anorthosite. These likely took less than three days to reach the surface from their place of origin, and show pristine composition and texture. Their characteristics show that they were little altered from their formation 1.6 to 1.8 billion years ago, other than some reheating during the opening of the Rio Grande rift.

Xenoliths are almost entirely absent in the ejecta from Hunt&#x27;s Hole, but xenoliths are found in Potrillo maar to the south.
==NASA training==
NASA geologically trained the Apollo Astronauts in April and November 1969, June 1970, and January and December 1971. Astronauts who would use this training on the Moon included Apollo 12&#x27;s Pete Conrad and Alan Bean, Apollo 14&#x27;s Alan Shepard and Edgar Mitchell, Apollo 15&#x27;s David Scott and James Irwin, Apollo 16&#x27;s John Young and Charlie Duke, and Apollo 17&#x27;s Gene Cernan and Jack Schmitt.

In 2017, a NASA field team visited the hole to test various instruments that are planned to be used in future space missions. Jack Schmitt attended the tests, as well as astronaut Barry Wilmore who was there to assist in simulated moonwalks at the hole.

==Access==
Kilbourne Hole is located within Organ Mountains–Desert Peaks National Monument and administered by the Bureau of Land Management. It is accessed via Doña Ana County Road A-011, driving west from the railroad. The hole is &quot;on the right, past the big tan dirt bank.&quot; Much of the land inside the hole is private property, and collecting rocks from the location is illegal. Hunt&#x27;s Hole is about south on A-013.

<doc id="414018" wikidata="Q333964" url="?curid=414018" title="Douglas Hogg">
<text>Douglas Martin Hogg, 3rd Viscount Hailsham, Baron Hailsham of Kettlethorpe, (born 5 February 1945), is a British politician and barrister. A member of the Conservative Party, he served in John Major&#x27;s second government as Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food from 1995 to 1997, and was a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1979 to 2010.

&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 2009 exposed Hogg for claiming upwards of £2,000 of taxpayers&#x27; money for the purposes of &quot;cleaning the moat&quot; of his country estate, Kettlethorpe Hall; thus he became one of the most prominent illustrations used by the media to portray the extent of the parliamentary expenses scandal, although it later emerged that Hogg had been encouraged by the House of Commons Fees Office (Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority&#x27;s precursor) to submit equivalent &quot;en bloc&quot; expenses &quot;so as to reduce admin&quot;. As a result of the negative publicity, Hogg did not seek re-election at the 2010 general election.

Aside from his hereditary peerage, he was made a life peer in the 2015 Dissolution Honours allowing him a seat in the House of Lords. As a member of the House of Lords he is styled &quot;Viscount Hailsham&quot; by parliamentary custom, the family title to which he succeeded in 2001.

==Early life==
Douglas Hogg, elder son of Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone and former Lord Chancellor, inherited the viscountcy on 12 October 2001 upon the death of his father who had disclaimed that title for life in 1963, but who later accepted a life peerage in 1970; he is the grandson of Douglas Hogg, formerly Lord Chancellor and Lord President of the Council until 1938.

He was educated at Sunningdale School followed by Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford. He served as the President of the Oxford Union in Michaelmas Term 1965, graduating with a degree in History in 1966. He was called to the Bar in 1968, after which he practised as a barrister. He became a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1990. His younger sister, Mary Hogg, a barrister, was later appointed a High Court judge assigned to the Family Division.

==Member of Parliament==

The Hon. Douglas Hogg was elected as a Member of Parliament at the 1979 general election for the Lincolnshire seat of Grantham, following the retirement of the sitting Conservative MP Joseph Godber.

The Grantham seat was abolished at the 1997 general election; however, Hogg stood and was returned as MP for Sleaford and North Hykeham in 1997.

===In government===
A few weeks before the murder of Belfast soliticer Pat Finucane, Hogg, then a junior British minister, stated in Parliament that certain lawyers were &quot;unduly sympathetic to the IRA.&quot; In the Stevens Inquiry run by the British state, Hoggs comments in parliament were deemed to have potentially lead to the killing of Belfast solicitor Pat Finnucane 

&quot;2.17 My Enquiry team also investigated an allegation that senior RUC officers briefed the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for the Home Department, the Rt Hon Douglas Hogg QC, MP, that &#x27;some solicitors were unduly sympathetic to the cause of the IRA&#x27;. Mr Hogg repeated this view during a debate on the Prevention of Terrorism legislation in the House of Commons. Within a few weeks Patrick Finucane was murdered. Mr Hogg&#x27;s comments about solicitors&#x27; support for terrorism made on 17 January 1989 aroused controversy. To the extent that they were based on information passed by the RUC, they were not justifiable and the Enquiry concludes that the Minister was compromised.

In Parliament, Hogg served as a member of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Select committee from 1979, until his appointment as Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Leon Brittan in 1982.

Hogg became a junior member of the Government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher following the 1983 general election, when he served as a Whip for a year. He rejoined HM Government in 1986 when he was appointed as a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Home Office, and was promoted in 1989 to Minister of State at the Department of Trade and Industry.

Hogg was moved in 1990 under the leadership of Prime Minister John Major to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, becoming a member of the Privy Council in 1992. He joined Major&#x27;s Cabinet as the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in 1995, serving in that capacity during the BSE crisis for which he received much criticism and remaining in post until the election of Tony Blair&#x27;s Labour Government in 1997.

On 3 March 1997, a disgruntled farmer from Anglesey, Louis Hayward, drove six hours from his farm to Kettlethorpe Hall in order to dump three tonnes of pig manure outside Hogg&#x27;s house.

Following the 1997 general election, Hogg was appointed a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee for a year and was a backbencher Member of Parliament until 2010. The House of Lords Act 1999 removed the automatic right of hereditary peers to a seat in the House of Lords, so when his father died in 2001 (being heir apparent to the peerage), he was not required (as would previously have been the case) to resign from the House of Commons and remained an MP until retiring in 2010.

===Stevens Enquiry===
In the report of his enquiry concerning collusion in Northern Ireland between loyalist paramilitaries and the security forces, under &quot;Other Matters concerning Collusion&quot;, a section of Sir John Stevens&#x27; report reads:

:&quot;2.17 My Enquiry team also investigated an allegation that senior Royal Ulster Constabulary officers briefed the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the Rt Hon Douglas Hogg QC MP, that &#x27;some solicitors were unduly sympathetic to the cause of the IRA&#x27;. Mr Hogg repeated this view [their expressed concerns] during a debate on the Prevention of Terrorism legislation in the House of Commons. Within a few weeks Patrick Finucane was murdered. Mr Hogg&#x27;s comments about solicitors&#x27; support for terrorism made on 17 January 1989 aroused controversy. To the extent that they were based on information passed by the RUC, they were not justifiable and the Enquiry [Inquiry] concludes that the Minister was compromised.&quot;

===Expenses===
Hogg claimed near maximum Additional Costs Allowance in the 2001 and 2005 UK Parliaments.

In 2009, during the row over MPs&#x27; expenses, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; alleged that Hogg had submitted and was paid a claim form including more than £2,000 for the moat around his country estate, Kettlethorpe Hall, to be cleared. The taxpayer helped meet the cost of a full-time housekeeper. Other allegations included expenses for work done to Hogg&#x27;s stables and for his piano to be tuned. He generously spent or perhaps somewhat overspent on his farm and home office: Hogg agreed a deal with the expenses office simply to have one twelfth of the second homes allowance paid into his bank account every month.

In his defence, Hogg resolutely claimed he had not claimed for moat cleaning, and that the items were a list of all expenses incurred during house works, most of which were not paid for by the taxpayer. Hogg responded to the newspaper&#x27;s claims by saying he had agreed the claims with the Fees Office, and therefore hoped and believed that they would comply with the rules and the &quot;spirit of the rules&quot; as advised. In saying that his claims complied with both the spirit and letter of the rules, Hogg said he had issued, in the interests of transparency, full lists of all his expenditure on the property but these were never meant to be the record of a claim.

On 14 May, Hogg agreed to repay the £2,200 cost of clearing the moat, after an order from the party leadership. He maintained he had not claimed the money, but agreed it had not been &quot;positively excluded&quot; from paperwork submitted to the Commons Fees Office. Following the scandal, Hogg announced on 19 May 2009 that he would not stand at the following general election.

==House of Lords==
Prime Minister David Cameron put Hailsham forward for a life barony to be included in the 2011 New Year Honours, but House of Lords Appointments Commission advised against the appointment.

In 2013, Hailsham stood for election to the House of Lords seat made vacant by the death of the 13th Earl Ferrers, losing to the 5th Viscount Ridley. Months later, he stood for the hereditary peers&#x27; vacancy to the 90-elected such seats in the House of Lords, following the death of Hugh Mackay, 14th Lord Reay, when Lord Borwick was elected.

On 12 October 2015, he was created a life peer as &quot;Baron Hailsham of Kettlethorpe, of Kettlethorpe in the County of Lincolnshire&quot;, enabling him to sit in the House of Lords.

==In film and fiction==
In February 2010 he was played by Geoffrey Beevers in the television film &quot;On Expenses&quot;.

==Marriage and children==
Hogg married Hon. Sarah Boyd-Carpenter, daughter of John, Baron Boyd-Carpenter, on 6 June 1968 in Westminster. They have two children:

* Hon. Charlotte Mary Hogg (born 26 August 1970), previously in charge of retail operations at Santander UK, in 2013 she was appointed first Chief Operating Officer at the Bank of England, under Governor Mark Carney. In March 2017 she served briefly as Deputy Governor (Markets and Banking), before resigning from both positions for failure to declare that her brother was employed in the banking industry.
* Hon. Quintin John Neil Martin Hogg (born 12 October 1973), heir apparent to the viscountcy.

As his wife was created a life peer as Baroness Hogg in 1995, the Hailshams are among the few couples both of whom hold noble titles in their own right.

<text>Maritime Jewel was a double-hulled oil tanker launched in 1999 and completed in 2000. Entering service that year, the ship was known as MV &quot;Limburg&quot; until 2003. The ship carried crude oil between ports in Iran and Malaysia. On 6 October 2002, &quot;Limburg&quot; was attacked by suicide bombers, causing roughly to leak into the Gulf of Aden. One crew member was killed and twelve more wounded in the attack. Four days after the attack, the tanker was towed to Dubai where she was repaired and renamed &quot;Maritime Jewel&quot;. &quot;Maritime Jewel&quot; was broken up for scrap at Chittagong, Bangladesh on 15 May 2018.

==Description==
Ordered as &quot;Limburg&quot; the vessel was long overall and between perpendiculars with a beam of . The ship&#x27;s gross tonnage (GT) was 157,833 tons, with a deadweight tonnage (DWT) of 299,364 tons and a net tonnage (NT) of 108,708 tons. The ship was powered by a diesel engine driving one shaft giving the vessel a maximum speed of . 

==History==
&quot;Limburg&quot;″s keel was laid down on 24 May 1999 and the ship was launched on 28 August 1999. &quot;Limburg&quot; was completed on 5 January 2000 and entered service that year.

===Bombing===
On 6 October 2002, &quot;Limburg&quot; was carrying of crude oil from Saudi Arabia to Malaysia, and was in the Gulf of Aden off Yemen to pick up another load of oil. She was registered under a French flag and had been chartered by the Malaysian petrol firm Petronas. While she was 3 km off the port of Al-Shihr, suicide bombers rammed an explosives-laden dinghy into the starboard side of the tanker. Upon detonation the vessel caught fire and approximately of oil leaked into the Gulf of Aden. Although Yemeni officials initially claimed that the explosion was caused by an accident, later investigations found traces of TNT on the damaged ship.

One crew member was killed, and twelve other crew members were injured. The fire was extinguished, and four days later &quot;Limburg&quot; was towed to Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The ship was renamed &quot;Maritime Jewel&quot;, bought by Tanker Pacific, and repaired at Dubai Drydocks from March to August 2003. The attack caused the short-term collapse of international shipping in the Gulf of Aden and as a result, cost Yemen $3.8 million a month in port revenues.

====Responsibility====
Al Qaeda claimed responsibility for the attack on the Jehad.net website, which has since been shut down. Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, who allegedly also masterminded the USS &quot;Cole&quot; bombing, was charged by US military prosecutors for planning the attack. Osama bin Laden issued a statement, which read:

On 3 February 2006, Fawaz Yahya al-Rabeiee, who had been sentenced to death for the &quot;Limburg&quot; attack, and 22 other suspected or convicted Al-Qaeda members escaped from jail in Yemen. Among them was Jamal al-Badawi, who masterminded the USS &quot;Cole&quot; bombing of 12 October 2000. Of the 23 escapees, 13 had been convicted of the &quot;Cole&quot; and &quot;Limburg&quot; bombings. On 1 October 2006, al-Rabeiee and Mohammed Daylami were shot and killed by Yemeni security forces during raids on two buildings in the capital Sana&#x27;a. One of al-Rabeiee&#x27;s accomplices was also arrested during the raids. In February 2014 Ahmed al-Darbi pleaded guilty before the Guantanamo military commission to helping plan several maritime terrorist attacks including the &quot;Limburg&quot; attack. By the time of the attack, al-Darbi was already detained at Guantanamo.

===Fate===
&quot;Maritime Jewel&quot; was broken up for scrap at Chittagong, Bangladesh on 1 May 2018.
