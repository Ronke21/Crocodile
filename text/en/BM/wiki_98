<text>Franz Josef Land () is a Russian archipelago in the Arctic Ocean. It is inhabited only by military personnel. It constitutes the northernmost part of Arkhangelsk Oblast and consists of 192 islands, which cover an area of , stretching from east to west and from north to south. The islands are categorized in three groups (western, central, and eastern) separated by the British Channel and the Austrian Strait. The central group is further divided into a northern and southern section by the Markham Sound. The largest island is Prince George Land, which measures , followed by Wilczek Land, Graham Bell Island and Alexandra Land.

Approximately 85% of the archipelago is glaciated, with large unglaciated areas on the largest islands and many of the smallest ones. The islands have a combined coastline of . Compared to other Arctic archipelagos, Franz Josef Land is highly dissected, as a result of it being heavily glaciated, with a very low ratio of total area to coastline of just ~3.6 square kilometers per coastline kilometer. Cape Fligely on Rudolf Island is the northernmost point of the Eastern Hemisphere. The highest elevations are found in the central and eastern group, with the highest point located on Wiener Neustadt Island, above mean sea level.

The archipelago was first spotted by the Norwegian sailors Nils Fredrik Rønnbeck and Johan Petter Aidijärvi in 1865, although they did not report their finding. The first reported finding was in the 1873 Austro-Hungarian North Pole expedition led by Julius von Payer and Karl Weyprecht, who named the area after Emperor Franz Joseph I.

In 1926, the Soviet Union annexed the islands, which were known at the time as Fridtjof Nansen Land, and settled small outposts for research and military purposes. The Kingdom of Norway rejected the claim and several private expeditions were sent to the islands. With the Cold War, the islands became off limits for foreigners and two military airfields were built. The islands have been a nature sanctuary since 1994 and became part of the Russian Arctic National Park in 2012.

==History==

There are two candidates for the discovery of Franz Josef Land. The first was the Norwegian sealing vessel &quot;Spidsbergen&quot;, with captain Nils Fredrik Rønnbeck and harpooner Johan Petter Aidijärvi. They sailed northeast from Svalbard in 1865 searching for suitable sealing sites, and they found land that was most likely Franz Josef Land. The account is believed to be factual, but an announcement of the discovery was never made, and their sighting therefore remained unknown to subsequent explorers. It was at the time common to keep newly discovered areas secret, as their discovery was aimed at exploiting them for sealing and whaling, and exposure would cause competitors to flock to the site. Russian scientist N. G. Schilling proposed in 1865 that the ice conditions in the Barents Sea could only be explained if there was another land mass in the area, but he never received funding for an expedition.

The Austro-Hungarian North Pole Expedition of 1872–74 was the first to announce the discovery of the islands. Led by Julius von Payer and Karl Weyprecht of Austria-Hungary on board the schooner &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;, the expedition&#x27;s primary goal was to find the Northeast Passage and its secondary goal to reach the North Pole. Starting in July 1872, the vessel drifted from Novaya Zemlya to a new landmass, which they named in honor of Franz Joseph I (1830–1916), Emperor of Austria. The expedition contributed significantly to the mapping and exploration of the islands. The next expedition to spot the archipelago was the Dutch Expedition for the Exploration of the Barents Sea, on board the schooner &quot;Willem Barents&quot;. Constrained by the ice, they never reached land.

===Polar exploration===
Benjamin Leigh Smith&#x27;s expedition in 1880, aboard the barque &quot;Eira&quot;, followed a route from Spitsbergen to Franz Josef Land, landing on Bell Island in August. Leigh Smith explored the vicinity and set up a base at Eira Harbour, before exploring towards McClintock Island. He returned the following year in the same vessel, landing at Grey Bay on George Land. The explorers were stopped by ice at Cape Flora, and &quot;Eira&quot; sank on 21 August. They built a cottage and stayed the winter, to be rescued by the British vessels &quot;Kara&quot; and &quot;Hope&quot; the following summer. These early expeditions concentrated their explorations on the southern and central parts of the archipelago.

Nansen&#x27;s &quot;Fram&quot; expedition was an 1893–1896 attempt by the Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen to reach the geographical North Pole by harnessing the natural east–west current of the Arctic Ocean. Departing in 1893, &quot;Fram&quot; drifted from the New Siberian Islands for one and a half years before Nansen became impatient and set out to reach the North Pole on skis with Hjalmar Johansen. Eventually, they gave up on reaching the pole and instead found their way to Franz Josef Land, the nearest land known to man. They were thus able to establish that there was no large landmass north of this archipelago. In the meantime the Jackson–Harmsworth Expedition set off in 1894, set up a base on Bell Island, and stayed for the winter. The following season they spent exploring. By pure chance, at Cape Flora in the spring of 1896, Nansen stumbled upon Frederick George Jackson, who was able to transport him back to Norway. Nansen and Jackson explored the northern, eastern, and western portions of the islands.
Once the basic geography of Franz Josef Land had become apparent, expeditions shifted to using the archipelago as a basis to reach the North Pole. The first such attempt was conducted by the National Geographic Society-sponsored American journalist Walter Wellman in 1898. The two Norwegians, Paul Bjørvig and Bernt Bentsen, stayed the winter 1898–9 at Cape Heller on Wilczek Land, but insufficient fuel caused the latter to die. Wellman returned the following year, but the polar expedition itself was quickly abandoned when they lost most of their equipment. Italian nobleman Luigi Amedeo organized the next expedition in 1899, on the &quot;Stella Polare&quot;. They stayed the winter, and in February and again in March 1900 set out towards the pole, but failed to get far.
Evelyn Baldwin, sponsored by William Ziegler, organized the Ziegler Polar Expedition of 1901. Setting up a base on Alger Island, he stayed the winter exploring the area, but failed to press northwards. The expedition was largely regarded as an utter failure by the exploration and scientific community, which cited the lack of proper management. Unhappy with the outcome, Ziegler organized a new expedition, for which he appointed Anthony Fiala, second-in-command in the first expedition, as leader. It arrived in 1903 and spent the winter. Their ship, &quot;America&quot;, was crushed beyond repair in December and disappeared in January. Still, they made two attempts towards the pole, both of which were quickly abandoned. They were forced to stay another year, making yet another unsuccessful attempt at the pole, before being evacuated in 1905 by the &quot;Terra Nova&quot;.

The first Russian expedition was carried out in 1901, when the icebreaker &quot;Yermak&quot; traveled to the islands. The next expedition, led by hydrologist Georgy Sedov, embarked in 1912 but did not reach the archipelago until the following year because of ice. Among its scientific contributions were the first snow measurements of the archipelago, and the determination that changes of the magnetic field occur in cycles of fifteen years. It also conducted topographical surveys of the surrounding area. Scurvy set in during the second winter, killing a machinist. Despite lacking prior experience or sufficient provisions, Sedov insisted on pressing forward with a march to the pole. His condition deteriorated and he died on 6 March.
&quot;Hertha&quot; was sent to explore the area, and its captain, I. I. Islyamov, hoisted a Russian iron flag at Cape Flora and proclaimed Russian sovereignty over the archipelago. The act was motivated by the ongoing First World War and Russian fears of the Central Powers establishing themselves there. The world&#x27;s first Arctic flight took place in August 1914, when Polish aviator (one of the first pilots of the Russian Navy) Jan Nagórski overflew Franz Josef Land in search of Sedov&#x27;s group. &quot;Andromeda&quot; set out for the same purpose; while failing to locate them, the crew were able to finally determine the non-existence of Peterman Land and King Oscar Land, suspected lands north of the islands.

===The Soviet Union===
Soviet expeditions were sent almost yearly from 1923. Franz Josef Land had been considered &quot;terra nullius&quot; – land belonging to no one – but on 15 April 1926 the Soviet Union declared its annexation of the archipelago. Emulating Canada&#x27;s declaration of the sector principle, they pronounced all land between the Soviet mainland and the North Pole to be Soviet territory. This principle has never been internationally recognized. Both Italy and Norway protested. Norway was first and foremost concerned about its economic interests in the area, in a period when Norwegian hunters and whalers were also being barred from the White Sea, Novaya Zemlya and Greenland; the Soviet government, however, largely remained passive, and did not evict Norwegian hunting ships during the following years. Nor did the Soviets interfere when, in 1928, several foreign ships entered the waters in search of the vanished airship &quot;Italia&quot;.

Norway attempted both a diplomatic solution and a Lars Christensen-financed expedition to establish a weather station to gain economic control over the islands, but both failed in 1929. Instead the Soviet icebreaker &quot;Sedov&quot; set out, led by Otto Schmidt, landed in Tikhaya Bay, and began construction of a permanent base. The Soviet government proposed renaming the archipelago Fridtjof Nansen Land in 1930, but the name never came into use. In 1930 the Norwegian Bratvaag Expedition visited the archipelago, but was asked by Soviet authorities to respect Soviet territorial water in the future. Other expeditions that year were the Norwegian-Swedish balloon expedition led by Hans Wilhelmsson Ahlmann on &quot;Quest&quot; and the German airship &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot;. Except for a German weather station emplaced during the Second World War, these were the last Western expeditions to Franz Josef Land until 1990.

Soviet activities grew rapidly following the International Polar Year in 1932. The archipelago was circumnavigated, people landed on Victoria Island, and a topographical map was completed. In 1934–35 geological and glaciological expeditions were carried out, cartographic flights were flown, and up to sixty people stayed the winters between 1934 and 1936, which also saw the first birth. The first drifting ice station was set up out of Rudolf Island in 1936. An airstrip was then constructed on a glacier on the island, and by 1937 the winter population hit 300.

Activity dwindled during the Second World War and only a small group of men were kept at Rudolf Island, remaining unsupplied throughout the war. They never discovered Nazi Germany&#x27;s establishment of a weather station, named Schatzgräber, on Alexandra Land as part of the North Atlantic weather war. The German station was evacuated in 1944 after the men were struck by trichinosis from eating polar bear meat. Apparent physical evidence of the base was discovered in 2016.

The Cold War produced renewed Soviet interest in the islands because of their strategic military significance. The islands were regarded as an &quot;unsinkable aircraft carrier&quot;. The site of the former German weather station was selected as the location of a Soviet aerodrome and military base, Nagurskoye. With the advent of intercontinental ballistic missiles, the Soviet Union changed its military strategy in 1956, abolishing the strategic need for an airbase on the archipelago. The International Geophysical Year of 1957 and 1958 gave a new rise to the scientific interest in the archipelago and an airstrip was built on Heiss Island in 1956. The following year the geophysical Ernst Krenkel Observatory was established there. Activity at Tikhaya Bay was closed in 1959.

Because of the islands&#x27; military significance, the Soviet Union closed off the area to foreign researchers, although Soviet researchers carried out various expeditions, including in geophysics, studies of the ionosphere, marine biology, botany, ornithology, and glaciology. The Soviet Union opened up the archipelago for international activities from 1990, with foreigners having fairly straightforward access.

===Recent history===
As part of the opening up of Franz Josef Land, the Institute of Geography in Moscow, Stockholm University and Umeå University (Sweden) conducted expeditions to Alexandra Land in August 1990 and August 1991, studying climate- and glacial history by radiocarbon dating raised beaches and antlers from extinct caribou. The work was conducted from a small research base southwest of Nagurskoye, built in 1989. Also in 1990, a collaboration between the Academy of Sciences, the Norwegian Polar Institute and the Polish Academy of Sciences resulted in the first of several archaeological expeditions organized by the Institute of Culture in Moscow. The military base on Graham Bell Island was abandoned in the early 1990s. The military presence at Nagurskoye was reduced to that of a border post, and the number of people stationed at Krenkel Observatory was reduced from 70 to 12. The archipelago and the surrounding waters were declared a nature reserve in April 1994. The opening of the archipelago also saw the introduction of tourism, most of which takes place on Russian-operated icebreakers. In 2011, in a move to better accommodate tourism in the archipelago, the Russian Arctic National Park was expanded to include Franz Josef Land. However, in August 2019, Russia abruptly withdrew its approval for a Norwegian cruise ship to visit the islands.

In 2012, the Russian Air Force decided to reopen the Graham Bell Airfield as part of a series of reopenings of air bases in the Arctic. A major new base, named the &quot;Arctic Trefoil&quot; for its three lobed structure, was constructed at Nagurskoye. It can maintain 150 soldiers for 18 months and has an area of 14,000 square meters. The upgraded airbase is considered a threat to the U.S. military installation at Thule, Greenland.

In 2017, Russian president Vladimir Putin visited the archipelago.

In August 2019, a geographic expedition by the Russian Northern Fleet to Franz Josef Land and Novaya Zemlya discovered a new island in the archipelago, previously thought to be a peninsula of Hall Island.

==Geography==


The archipelago constitutes the northernmost part of Russia&#x27;s Arkhangelsk Oblast, located between 79°46′ and 81°52′ north and 44°52′ and 62°25′ east. It is situated north of Novaya Zemlya and east of the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard. Located within the Arctic Ocean, Franz Josef Land constitutes the northeastern border of the Barents Sea and the northwestern border of the Kara Sea. The islands are from the North Pole and from the Yamal Peninsula, the closest point of the Eurasian mainland. The archipelago falls within varying definitions of the Asia–Europe border, and is therefore variously defined as part of Asia or of Europe. Cape Flighely, situated at 81°50′ north, is the northernmost point in Eurasia and the Eastern Hemisphere, and of either Europe or Asia, depending on the continental definition. It is the third-closest landmass to the North Pole.

The archipelago comprises 191 uninhabited islands with a combined area of . These stretch from east to west and from north to south. One can categorize the islands into three groups, a western, central and eastern, separated by the British Channel and the Austrian Strait. The central group is further divided into a northern and southern section by the Markham Strait. Graham Bell Island is separated from the eastern group by the Severo–Vostochnyi Strait. There are two named island clusters: Zichy Land north of Markham Sound; and Belaya Zemlya to the extreme northeast. The straits are narrow, between several hundred meters to wide. They reach depths of , below the shelf of the Barents Sea.

The largest island is Prince George Land, which measures . Three additional islands exceed in size: Wilczek Land, Graham Bell Island and Alexandra Land. Five more islands exceed : Hall Island, Salisbury Island, McClintock Island, Jackson Island and Hooker Island. The smallest 135 islands constitute 0.4 percent of the archipelago&#x27;s area. The highest elevation is a peak on Wilczek Land, which rises above mean sea level. Victoria Island, located to the west of Alexandra Land, is administratively part of the archipelago, but the island is not geographically part of the island group and is closer to Svalbard, located from Kvitøya.

==Geology==
Geologically the archipelago is located on the northern edge of the Barents Sea Platform, within an area where Mesozoic sedimentary rocks are exposed. The area has four units separated by regional erosion surfaces. The Upper Paleozoic unit is poorly exposed and was created by folding during the Caledonian period. The Lower Mesozoic unit, consisting of coastal and marine sediments from the Upper Triassic period, is present on most islands and on the bottom of the straits and consists of limestones, shales, sandstones and conglomerate.

The Upper Mesozoic unit dominates in the southern and western parts, consisting of massive effusive rocks made up of basaltic sheets separated by volcanic ashes and tuffs, mixed with terrigenous rocks with layers of coal. The Mesozoic-Tertiary unit remains mostly on the sea floor and consist of marine quartz sandstones and shales. Plate tectonics of the Arctic Ocean created basalt lavas and dolerite sheets and dykes in the Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous periods. The land is rising by per year, due to the melting of the Barents Sea Ice Sheet c. 10,000 years ago.

==Hydrology==
Franz Josef Land is dominated by glaciation, which covers an area of , or 85 percent of the archipelago. The glaciers have an average thickness of , which would convert to . This would alone give a eustatic rise in sea level should it melt. Large ice-free areas are only found on the largest islands, such as the Armitage Peninsula of George Land, the Kholmistyi Peninsula of Graham Bell Island, the Central&#x27;naya Susha of Alexandra Land, the Ganza Point of Wilczek Land and the Heyes Island. Most of the smaller islands are unglaciated.

Streams only form during the runoff period from May through early September. Permafrost causes most of the runoff to take place on the surface, with streams only forming on the largest islands. The longest river is long and forms on George Land, while there are several streams on Alexandra Land, the longest being . There are about one thousand lakes in the archipelago, the majority of which are located on Alexandra Land and George Land. Most lakes are located in depressions caused by glacial erosion, in addition to a smaller number of lagoon lakes. Their sizes vary from to . Most are only deep, with the deepest measured at .

The sea currents surrounding the archipelago touch eastern Svalbard and northern Novaya Zemlya. The cold Makarov Current flows from the north and the Arctic Current flows from the northwest, while the warmer Novaya Zemlya Current flows from the south. The latter has temperatures over , while the bottom water lies below . The southern coastal regions of the archipelago experience currents from east to west. Average velocity is between per second. The tidal component in coastal areas is per second. Pack ice occurs throughout the year around the entire island group, with the lowest levels being during August and September. One-year winter ice starts forming in October and reaches a thickness of . Icebergs are common year-round.

==Climate==

Franz Josef Land is in a transition zone between an ice cap climate (EF) and a tundra climate (ET), technically falling into the latter because July and August average above freezing, nevertheless, low temperatures remain below freezing year round. The main forces influencing the climate are the glaciation and sea ice. At 81° north the archipelago experiences 141 annual days of midnight sun, from 12 April to 30 August. During the winter it experiences 128 days of polar night from 19 October to 23 February. Abundant cloud cover further cools the climate. The sea starts to freeze in late September and reaches its annual maximum in March, at which time ninety-five percent of the sea is ice-covered. The ice coverage starts to decrease in May and experiences major melting in June, with the minimum occurring in August or early September.

During winter, high-pressure weather and clear skies cause radiation loss from the ground, sending temperatures down to . During shifts the temperatures can change by within hours. Coastal stations experience mean January temperatures of between and , varying heavily from year to year depending on the degree of cycles in weather patterns. During summer the temperatures are a lot more even and average at between and at Hayes Island. Fog is most common during the summer. Average annual precipitation at the coastal stations is between , with the wettest months being from July through September. Elevated areas can experience considerably higher precipitation. Franz Josef Land is significantly colder than Spitsbergen, which experiences warmer winter averages, but is warmer than the Canadian Arctic Archipelago.

==Nature==

The climate and permafrost limits soil development in the archipelago. Large areas are devoid of soil, with permafrost polygons being the most common site for soil to occur. The soil typically has incomplete soil profiles and polygonal form with rich content of iron and is either neutral or slightly acidic. The brown upper humus layers have three percent organic matter, increasing to eight percent in the southernmost islands. Arctic desert soils occur on the eastern group islands, while the areas near the edge of the glaciers have bog-like arctic soil.

The flora varies between islands, based on the natural conditions. On some islands, vegetation is limited to lichen growing on stones. Vegetation typically covers five to ten percent of the ground surface, with notable exceptions under bird colonies where it can reach one hundred percent. Vegetation varies with the altitude: up to there is a belt of grass-moss arctic desert, then moss-lichen arctic desert to , then lichen arctic desert up to and above lifeless snow desert, with occasional lichens on nunataks and snow algae on glacier surfaces.
Trees, shrubs and tall plants cannot survive. About 150 species of bryophytes dominate the grassy turf, of which two-thirds are mosses and a third liverworts. The most common species are &quot;Aulacomnium&quot;, &quot;Ditrichum&quot;, &quot;Drepanocladus&quot;, &quot;Orthothecium&quot; and &quot;Tomenthypnum&quot;. More than 100 species of lichen are found on the island, the most common being &quot;Caloplaca&quot;, &quot;Lecanora&quot;, &quot;Lecidea&quot;, &quot;Ochrolechia&quot; and &quot;Rinodina&quot;. There are sixteen species of grass and about 100 species of algae, most commonly Cyanophyta and Diatomea. Fifty-seven species of vascular plants have been reported. The most common are Arctic poppy and saxifraga, which grow everywhere, independent of habitat, with the latter&#x27;s nine species being found on all islands. Common plants in wet areas are &quot;Alopecurus magellanicus&quot; (alpine meadow-foxtail grass), buttercups and polar willow. &quot;Alopecurus magellanicus&quot; and &quot;Papaver dahlianum&quot; are the tallest plants, able to reach heights of .

More than one hundred taxa of single-cell pelagic algae have been identified around the archipelago, the most common being &quot;Thalassiosira antarctica&quot; and &quot;Chaetoceros decipiens&quot;. The bloom takes place between May and August. Of the roughly fifty species of zooplankton, calanoids dominate, with &quot;Calanus glacialis&quot; and &quot;Calanus hyperboreus&quot; constituting the greater portion of the biomass. On the sea bottom there are 34 species of macroalgae and at least 500 species of macrofauna. Most common are crustaceans such as amphipods and shrimps, polychaetes and echinoderms, such as sea bristles. The ice scouring causes there to be little life in the littoral zone, but the sublittoral zone () is dominated by laminaria, most commonly &quot;Laminaria sachcharina&quot;, and red algae, such as &quot;Phycodrys rubens&quot;.

There are 33 species of fish in the waters, none of which are abundant or commercially exploitable. The most common are polar cod, which reach lengths of , and liparidae. There are no endemic species within the archipelago. Forty-one species of birds have been documented in the archipelago, of which fourteen breed. These are dominated by seabirds such as fulmar, kittiwake, Brünnich&#x27;s guillemot, black guillemot and little auk are common throughout the archipelago, while seven other species prefer nesting on flat tundra: common eider, purple sandpiper, Arctic skua, glaucous gull, ivory gull, Arctic tern and snow bunting. Some ivory gulls, little auks and Brünnich&#x27;s guillemots opt to spend the winter on the islands.

The polar bear population of Franz Josef Land lies within the Barents Sea subpopulation, which also includes polar bears inhabiting Svalbard and the western coast of Novaya Zemlya. In 2004, the Barents Sea subpopulation was estimated at 2,650. There is also a population of Arctic fox, which typically have their territories near seabird habitats.

There are no caribou living on Franz Josef Land today. However, radiocarbon dating of shed antlers found on Alexandra Land in 1990 has shown that there was a population of caribou living on the island around 4000 to 2000 years ago. It is likely that the population died out when the climate became colder.

===Marine mammals===

As a declared marine mammal sanctuary, the area around the islands has a rich biodiversity of rare marine mammals.

Three species of seals habit the archipelago. Harp seal is the most common, although it breeds in the White Sea. Slightly less common is the bearded seal. Walruses were previously hunted, dramatically reducing the formerly abundant species. They have been internationally protected since 1952 and their numbers have since been on the rise, with between one and three thousand walruses living in the archipelago. The population is common with Svalbard and northern Novaya Zemlya.

Minke whales, humpback whale, and beluga whales are commonly seen around the island, and less commonly orcas and narwhales, with the archipelago being located on the northern edge of their summer range. Fin whales were recently confirmed to migrate into the waters.

Occasionally there are sightings of bowhead whale. The Russian Arctic stock of this species, ranging from Cape Farewell in Greenland and Svalbard/Spitsbergen areas to East Siberian Sea is considered to be the most endangered of all bowhead populations in the world. The waters around Franz Josef Land appear to be the most important place for this stock.

==Human activity==

Tourism travel to the archipelago is severely limited. There is no infrastructure to support tourists and the only way to reach the islands is by icebreaker, typically operating out of Murmansk. In 2012 there were only eight successful landings on the islands. A contributing factor to the low utilization is the difficulty of obtaining permissions and frequent closing of the Kola Bay to accommodate military exercises. The most frequent service is a three-week North Pole tour with Russian nuclear-powered icebreaker &quot;50 Let Pobedy&quot;, which stops by the islands en route. The most popular destinations are areas with bird cliffs and walrus colonies, such as Cape Flora on Northbrook Island and Cape Rubini on Hooker Island, as well as historical remains such as Nansen&#x27;s hut on Jackson Island. Tourists are commonly landed by helicopter. For purposes of amateur radio awards the islands count as a separate international &quot;entity&quot;. Activity by radio operators has become less frequent, though it does occasionally occur. Nagurskoye Air Base is located on the Northern part of Alexandra Land. It was extensively upgraded in the mid-2010s to support a greater military presence.

<text>Kondopoga (; ; ) is a town and the administrative center of Kondopozhsky District of the Republic of Karelia, Russia, located by the northern tip of the Kondopoga Bay of Lake Onega, near the mouth of the Suna River and Kivach Nature Reserve, about from Petrozavodsk. Population: 

==History==

The very first written reference to Kondopoga dates back to 1563. It became important after rich marble deposits were discovered nearby in 1757 and the quarries were founded. Kondopoga became a logistics hub for marble shipping to St. Petersburg. Later, iron ore deposits were found in the vicinity, which were shipped to metallurgical factories in Petrozavodsk and in Kentjärvi.

By 1892, Kondopoga had forty-eight buildings, three hundred inhabitants, two churches, and a college and held an annual trade fair on September 8–15.

During World War I, the Main Artillery Administrative Department of the Russian Military Ministry started construction of a nitric acid plant there, which was essential for gunpowder production. A hydroelectric power station was designed to meet considerable demand in the energy for such a plant. Kondopoga was well suitable for such a station due to significant water level drop between Lakes Nigozero and Onega. A 30 MW station was to become the largest in Russia. However, the October Revolution and the subsequent Civil War delayed the project, which was only revived in the Soviet time as a part of the GOELRO plan. According to the project, the waters of the Suna River were to be redirected towards the hydroelectric power station via the lake system. On July 19, 1923, Sovnarkhoz of Karelia ratified the formation of a building society (Kondostroy) to build a hydroelectric power station and a major pulp and paper mill. Kondopoga became the administrative center of a district in 1932 and was granted town status in 1938. At the time, its population was about fourteen thousand inhabitants.

On November 3, 1941, during World War II, Kondopoga was totally destroyed. Industrial plants and factories were looted, including the pulp and paper mill, hydroelectric station, granite and brick factories, furniture factory, and other facilities. Approximately 250 houses and apartment buildings were demolished along with concert halls, museums, kindergarten, school, hotels, fire station, and government offices. All bridges in the vicinity were blown up. The town was occupied by Red Army on June 28, 1944. After the war, the town was rebuilt. In 1957, Kondopoga was declared the All-Union Komsomol building site. A number of new factories were built and the pulp and paper mill was also expanded. The population grew to 38,000 people.

On the night of August 29–30, 2006, two ethnic Russians were killed and several others badly injured by Chechens, starting 2006 ethnic tensions in Kondopoga.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Kondopoga serves as the administrative center of Kondopozhsky District, to which it is directly subordinated. As a municipal division, the town of Kondopoga, together with three rural localities, is incorporated within Kondopozhsky Municipal District as Kondopozhskoye Urban Settlement.

==Economy and transportation==
Kondopoga has a railway station on the Moscow–Murmansk railroad, some of the largest pulp and paper mills in Eastern Europe (e.g. OAO Kondopoga), a medical college, and facilities for the manufacture of building materials.

The Blue Highway, an international tourist route, starts in Mo i Rana, Norway, goes through Sweden and Finland, and then through Kondopoga, before ending in Pudozh.

=== Trading ===
An important sector of the city&#x27;s economy is retail trade. Such large retail chains as «Pyaterochka», «Magnit», «Svetofor», «DNS», «Red&amp;White, «Fix Price» and others operate in Kondopoga.

The largest shopping centers are «Lotus City», «Rubin».

==Architecture==
First recorded as early as 1495, Kondopoga retained a rare monument of Russian wooden architecture — the Dormition Church (), built in 1774. The central column of this church was crowned by a hipped roof, 42 m in total height. The column was based on a central rectangular framework, with adjacent frameworks for the refectory and altar. The altar framework was covered by a traditional wooden roof, called a barrel roof.

The church was burnt up in 2018 by a mentally disordered teenager, with only a few charred remains left at its place. Island Rashe

<doc id="426388" wikidata="Q190978" url="?curid=426388" title="Northern Ireland national football team">
<text>The Northern Ireland national football team represents Northern Ireland in men&#x27;s international association football. From 1882 to 1950, all of Ireland was represented by a single side, the Ireland national football team, organised by the Irish Football Association (IFA). In 1921, the jurisdiction of the IFA was reduced to Northern Ireland following the secession of clubs in the soon-to-be Irish Free State, although its team remained the national team for all of Ireland until 1950, and used the name &quot;Ireland&quot; until the 1970s. The Football Association of Ireland (FAI) organises the separate Republic of Ireland national football team.

Although part of the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland has always had a representative side that plays in major professional tournaments – whether alongside the rest of Ireland pre-1922 or as its own entity – though not in the Olympic Games, as the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has always recognised United Kingdom representative sides, and currently Northern Irish athletes compete for Great Britain. 

Northern Ireland has competed in three FIFA World Cups, reaching the quarter-final stage in the 1958 and 1982 tournaments. Northern Ireland held the accolade of being the smallest nation to qualify for a World Cup Finals from their first appearance in 1958 until 2006, when Trinidad and Tobago qualified for the 2006 World Cup. At UEFA Euro 2016, the team made its first appearance at the European tournament and reached the round of 16. Northern Ireland last qualified for the World Cup in 1986.

== History ==

On 18 February 1882, 15 months after the founding of the Irish FA, Ireland made their international debut against England, losing 13–0 in a friendly played at Bloomfield in Belfast. This remains the record defeat for the team, and also England&#x27;s largest winning margin. On 25 February 1882, Ireland played their second international, against Wales at the Racecourse Ground, Wrexham, and an equaliser from Johnston became Ireland&#x27;s first ever goal.

In 1884, Ireland competed in the inaugural British Home Championship and lost all three games. Ireland did not win their first game until 19 February 1887, a 4–1 win over Wales in Belfast. Between their debut and this game, they had a run of 14 defeats and 1 draw, the longest run without a win in the 1800s. Despite the end of this run, heavy defeats continued. On 3 March 1888, they lost 11–0 to Wales and three weeks later, on 24 March, lost 10–2 to Scotland. Further heavy defeats came on 15 March 1890 when they lost 9–1 to England, on 18 February 1899 when they lost 13–2 to England and on 2 February 1901 when they lost 11–0 to Scotland.

In 1899, the Irish FA also changed its rules governing the selection of non-resident players. Before then the Ireland team selected its players exclusively from the Irish League, in particular the three Belfast-based clubs Linfield, Cliftonville and Distillery. On 4 March 1899, for the match against Wales, McAteer included four Irish players based in England. The change in policy produced dividends as Ireland won 1–0. Three weeks later, on 25 March, one of these four players, Archie Goodall, aged 34 years and 279 days, became the oldest player to score in international football during the 19th century when he scored Ireland&#x27;s goal in a 9–1 defeat to Scotland.

In 1920, Ireland was partitioned into Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland. In 1922, Southern Ireland gained independence as the Irish Free State, later to become a republic under the name of Ireland. Amid these political upheavals, a rival football association, the Football Association of Ireland, emerged in Dublin in 1921 and organised a separate league and international team. In 1923, at a time when the home nations had withdrawn from FIFA, the FAI was recognised by FIFA as the governing body of the Irish Free State on the condition that it changed its name to the Football Association of the Irish Free State. The Irish FA continued to organise its national team on an all-Ireland basis.

Between 1928 and 1946, the IFA were not affiliated to FIFA and the two Ireland teams co-existed, never competing in the same competition. On 8 March 1950, however, in a 0–0 draw with Wales at the Racecourse Ground in a FIFA World Cup qualifier, the IFA fielded a team that included four players who were born in the Irish Free State. All four players had previously played for the FAI in their qualifiers and as a result had played for two different associations in the same FIFA World Cup tournament.

After complaints from the FAI, FIFA intervened and restricted players&#x27; eligibility based on the political border. In 1953 FIFA ruled neither team could be referred to as Ireland, decreeing that the FAI team be officially designated as the Republic of Ireland, while the IFA team was to become Northern Ireland.

== Past performances ==
=== British Home Championship ===
Until the 1950s, the major competition for Northern Ireland/Ireland was the British Home Championship. The team won the competition eight times, taking the title outright on three occasions. They were the last winners of the now defunct competition held in 1984, and hence still are the British champions, and the trophy remains the property of the Irish FA.

=== FIFA World Cup ===

Northern Ireland&#x27;s best World Cup performance was in their first appearance in the finals, the 1958 World Cup, where they reached the quarter-finals after beating Czechoslovakia 2–1 in the play-off. They were knocked out by France, losing 4–0. In the 1958 competition, Northern Ireland became the least populous country to have qualified for the World Cup, a record that stood until Trinidad and Tobago qualified for the 2006 World Cup. Northern Ireland remains, however, the least populous country to have qualified for more than one World Cup finals tournament, to win a World Cup finals match, and to have progressed from the first round of the World Cup finals.

Captain of the national side at the 1958 World Cup was Danny Blanchflower, who also captained Tottenham Hotspur in the English league and was twice footballer of the year in England. His younger brother Jackie was also a key member of the national team, and won two league titles in England with Manchester United, until his career was ended by injuries suffered in the Munich air disaster of February 1958.

Despite the presence of world class forward George Best, another Manchester United player, for the 1960s and 1970s, Northern Ireland failed to qualify for any major tournaments.

Northern Ireland also qualified for the 1982 World Cup. Their opening game was against Yugoslavia at La Romareda stadium in Zaragoza. It was the international debut of 17-year-old Norman Whiteside, who became the youngest player ever in the World Cup finals, a record that still stands. The game finished goalless. Five days later, they drew 1–1 with Honduras, which was a disappointment, and many believed had doomed Northern Ireland&#x27;s chances of advancing in the competition. They needed a win against hosts Spain in the third and final group game at the Mestalla Stadium in Valencia. They faced a partisan atmosphere with a mostly Spanish crowd and a Spanish-speaking referee in Héctor Ortiz who was unwilling to punish dirty play from the Spanish players. A mistake from Spain goalkeeper Luis Arconada, however, gifted Gerry Armstrong the only goal of the game, and despite having Mal Donaghy sent off on 60 minutes, Northern Ireland went on to record a historic 1–0 win and top the first stage group.

A 2–2 draw with Austria at the Vicente Calderón Stadium meant that a win against France would take them into the semi-finals, however, a French team inspired by Michel Platini won 4–1 and eliminated Northern Ireland from the competition.

They also qualified for the 1986 World Cup where they went out in the Group stages.
Billy Bingham, a member of the 1958 squad, was manager for both of these tournaments. They have not qualified for any other World Cups since.

Lawrie Sanchez was appointed in January 2004 after a run of 13 games without a goal under the previous manager Sammy McIlroy, which was a European record for any international team until San Marino went over 20 games without scoring between October 2008 and August 2012. That run ended after his first game in charge, a 1–4 loss to Norway in a friendly in February 2004. The run of 16 games without a win ended after his second game, a 1–0 victory in a friendly over Estonia, with a largely experimental side, in March 2004.

On 7 September 2005, Northern Ireland beat England 1–0 in a 2006 World Cup qualifier at Windsor Park. David Healy scored the winner in the 73rd minute. Almost a year later, on 6 September 2006, Northern Ireland defeated Spain 3–2 in a qualifier for UEFA Euro 2008, with Healy scoring a hat-trick. In June 2007, Nigel Worthington was named manager in the place of Lawrie Sanchez, who took over at Fulham. Initially, Worthington took over until the end of the Euro 2008 qualifiers, but was later given a contract until the end of the Euro 2012 qualifiers. Michael O&#x27;Neill became manager in February 2012 after Worthington had resigned in October 2011 after a poor Euro 2012 qualification campaign.

The Northern Ireland team qualified for its first ever UEFA European Championship, Euro 2016 in France after 30 years without qualifying for a major tournament, after beating Greece 3–1 at Windsor Park on 8 October 2015. At the tournament, Northern Ireland were beaten 1–0 by Poland on 20 June 2016 followed by a 2–0 win against Ukraine on 16 June 2016 and finally a 1–0 loss against Germany in the group stage. That was enough to qualify for a Round of 16 spot where they lost 1–0 to Wales due to an unfortunate own goal by Gareth McAuley.

== Stadium ==
Northern Ireland play their home matches at Windsor Park, Belfast, home of Linfield, which they have use of on a 108-year lease, giving the owners 15% of revenue, including gate receipts and TV rights.

There was a proposal to build a multisports stadium for Northern Ireland at the disused Maze prison outside Lisburn for the use of Rugby, Gaelic games and football. This plan was given an &quot;in principle&quot; go-ahead by the Irish Football Association. However, it was opposed by fans, over 85% of whom in a match day poll conducted by the Amalgamation of Northern Ireland Supporters&#x27; Clubs (&quot;AONISC&quot;) preferred to stay at a smaller new or redeveloped ground in the city of Belfast. The AONISC organised a protest against the move to the Maze at the game against Estonia in March 2006.

The issue assumed ever greater urgency by 2007, following a series of inspections which questioned the suitability of Windsor Park to host international football. Following a reduction of capacity due to the closure of the Railway Stand, the IFA made it known that they wished to terminate their contract for the use of the stadium. A report on health and safety in October 2007 indicated that the South Stand might have to be closed for internationals, which would further reduce the stadium&#x27;s capacity to 9,000.
In April 2008, Belfast City Council announced that they had commissioned Drivers Jonas to conduct a feasibility study into the building of a Sports Stadium in Belfast which could accommodate international football, which was followed at the beginning of May 2008 by speculation that the Maze Stadium project was going to be radically revised by Peter Robinson, the finance and personnel minister in the Northern Ireland Assembly, so that any construction might be used for purposes other than football, rugby union and Gaelic games.
Given the time that is needed to build a new stadium, in the absence of significant work improving Windsor Park, it seemed to be likely that Northern Ireland might be forced to play their home games at a venue outside Northern Ireland for a period.

In March 2009, proposals were announced for the construction of a new 25,000-seat stadium in the Sydenham area of East Belfast as an alternative to the Maze proposal. This would form part of a major development, with links to both George Best Belfast City Airport and the Bangor railway line. The development would also include a hotel, and retail/leisure areas. The stadium itself would be used for both football and rugby union, with Glentoran and Ulster Rugby intended as tenants. Ulster GAA, however, who were a partner in the Maze proposal, stated that in the event of a new stadium being built in East Belfast, which is a major unionist area, their preference would then be to remain at Casement Park in nationalist west Belfast.

The IFA were initially non-committal about any of the proposals for improving their facilities, be it rebuilding Windsor Park, or supporting either the Maze or Sydenham proposals. In September 2009, however, they issued an announcement in favour of the redevelopment of Windsor Park. Although there were no specifics to this, Linfield had previously released a study with two proposals, of which the major one would be a £20 million rebuilding of the stadium, raising the spectator capacity to 20,000. In 2011, the Northern Ireland Executive allocated £138 million for a major programme of stadium redevelopment throughout Northern Ireland, with £28 million allocated to the redevelopment of Windsor Park. In June 2012, further details of the stadium&#x27;s redevelopment were released. The plan was to redevelop Windsor Park into an 18,000 all-seater stadium with a series of phased works originally intended to begin in the summer of 2013. The redevelopment would include the demolition of the existing East and South Stand structures, to be replaced by new purpose built stands that would partially enclose the stadium; complete renovation of the existing North and West Stands; and construction of both new conferencing facilities and a new headquarters facility for the IFA.

In February 2013, planning permission for the redevelopment was granted. The cost of the project was estimated to be around £29.2 million, of which £25.2 million would come from government funding. It was initially planned for the work to begin in September 2013. Two months later, however, Irish Premiership club Crusaders began legal proceedings to have the process judicially reviewed. As owners of the site, rivals Linfield were in line to receive not only a redeveloped stadium, but also £200,000 per annum from the IFA in land rent instead of the existing agreement which entitled Linfield to 15% of match revenue. Crusaders believed this to be against European Union competition law as well as a form of state aid towards Linfield. In a hearing that took place on 22 May 2013, Crusaders&#x27; request was granted. It was ruled that it was a possibility for the redevelopment to be classed as state aid towards Linfield. The aspect of the challenge concerning competition law, however, was dismissed.
In July 2013, Crusaders agreed to a possible settlement brought forward by the judicial review. The details of the settlement were not made public, but Crusaders said that it had the &quot;potential to benefit the entirety of the football family&quot;. In September 2013, sports minister Carál Ní Chuilín said that she was still committed to making sure the redevelopment went ahead as scheduled, after previously stating that she would not sign off on the funding until the IFA resolved &quot;governance issues&quot; surrounding David Martin&#x27;s return to the role of deputy president. In December 2013, three months after the work was originally scheduled to begin, the redevelopment was finally given the green light. The sports minister signed off on £31 million to complete the project. The redevelopment finally got under way on 6 May 2014 after the 2013–14 domestic season had finished, eight months later than originally planned. The work was completed in 2015.

=== Colours ===
Northern Ireland football team&#x27;s traditional colours are green, white and azure blue. Green has long been a traditional symbolic colour for Ireland. The azure blue comes from St. Patrick&#x27;s blue, which was adopted as the colour of the Anglo-Irish Order of St Patrick. While green is recognised at the de-facto national colour for Ireland, azure blue is still found in symbols of both the state and the island. The kit has been manufactured by Adidas since 2012. Prior to this, the kit was manufactured by Umbro.

=== Kit suppliers ===
=== Supporters ===
The Green and White Army is the name given to the fans that follow the Northern Ireland national football team.

Since the defeat of England in 2005, there has been an increased demand for tickets exceeding supply. Tongue-in-cheek songs such as &quot;We&#x27;re not Brazil, we&#x27;re Northern Ireland&quot; (sung to the tune of Battle Hymn of the Republic, an American Civil War song), &quot;It&#x27;s Just Like Watching Brazil&quot; and &quot;Stand up for the Ulstermen&quot; are popular at home matches.

One of the first footballing celebrities was former Manchester United and Northern Ireland footballer George Best. The 1968 European Footballer of the Year, Best won 37 caps and scored 9 goals for his country.

Leading up to the Euro 2016, YouTuber Sean Kennedy released the song &quot;Will Grigg&#x27;s on Fire&quot;, a parody about Northern Irish national Will Grigg to the tune of &quot;Freed From Desire&quot; by Gala. The song became a popular chant and internet sensation. A studio version was released by London-based production duo Blonde, going on to reach number seven in the iTunes UK Top 100.

=== Historic controversy over sectarianism ===

A small element of Northern Ireland&#x27;s support was, in the past, regarded as sectarian.

In 2000 the IFA launched the &quot;Football For All&quot; campaign to tackle sectarianism and racism at Northern Ireland games. Michael Boyd, the director of football development at the IFA, recalled how the team struggled to even get a sponsor for their kit because the image of Northern Irish football was so poor. Attendance at matches was low; at a 1999 game against France, then reigning World Cup champions, IFA could not sell out the ground and there were problems with &quot;sectarian singing and racist abuse.&quot; Neil Lennon, a Roman Catholic Celtic player who had been subject to sectarian abuse from Northern Ireland fans while playing for Northern Ireland in Windsor Park, was issued a death threat by Loyalists and retired from international football in 2002 as a result. Former Security Minister Jane Kennedy said the threat against Lennon &#x27;disgraced Northern Ireland in the eyes of the world&#x27; and widened the divide between the association and Catholic players and supporters. However, the incident represented a turning point in the campaign against sectarianism in the IFA which had seen slow progress in the previous two years.

Steps taken to eradicate the sectarian element within the support have been successful. Lennon has been quick to praise these initiatives. He also praised the &quot;Football For All&quot; Outstanding Achievement Award Winner Stewart MacAfee for the work he has done to create a more inclusive atmosphere at international games.

In 2006, Northern Ireland&#x27;s supporters were awarded the Brussels International Supporters Award for their charity work, general good humour and behaviour and efforts to stamp out sectarianism. Representatives of the Amalgamation of Official Northern Ireland Supporters&#x27; Clubs received the award from UEFA and EU representatives prior to the Northern Ireland–Spain game at Windsor Park in September 2006.

Northern Ireland Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure, Carál Ní Chuilín, the first senior Sinn Féin representative to attend an international at Windsor Park, commended &quot;the very real efforts that have been made by the IFA to tackle sectarianism at their matches&quot; after a match in August 2011. Twenty years after Lennon&#x27;s resignation, Northern Ireland international games regularly sell out and women and children were &quot;noticeable&quot; amongst the spectators.

=== Media coverage ===
Premier Sports currently have the rights to show all of Northern Ireland&#x27;s competitive international fixtures up until 2024.

Highlights of qualifiers are shown on BBC Northern Ireland with rights to World Cup Finals and European Championships held jointly by BBC and ITV - both channels shared coverage of Northern Ireland&#x27;s games at Euro 2016.

Dating from the 1960s, Northern Ireland&#x27;s games were shown live on BBC Northern Ireland, with highlights on network BBC via Sportsnight until the rights to home games were sold to Sky in 2007. In May 2013, Sky acquired the rights to all Northern Ireland qualifying games for UEFA Euro 2016 and the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
From 2008 to 2013, BBC Northern Ireland held the rights to highlights of all of Northern Ireland&#x27;s home international qualifiers. But in May 2013, ITV secured a deal to show highlights of the European Qualifiers for Euro 2016 and the 2018 World Cup, including Northern Ireland games, between 2014 and 2017.

In 2015, BBC Northern Ireland acquired the live rights to show Northern Ireland&#x27;s friendlies in the run-up to UEFA Euro 2016, but the next two subsequent home friendlies against Croatia and New Zealand were shown on Premier Sports/eirSport until the contract ended before the 2018 World Cup.

<text>freedesktop.org (fd.o), formerly X Desktop Group (XDG), is a project to work on interoperability and shared base technology for free-software desktop environments for the X Window System (X11) and Wayland on Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. Although freedesktop.org produces specifications for interoperability, it is not a formal standards body.

The project was founded by Havoc Pennington, a GNOME developer working for Red Hat in March 2000. Widely used open-source X-based desktop projects, such as GNOME, KDE&#x27;s Plasma Desktop, and Xfce, are collaborating with the freedesktop.org project. In 2006, the project released Portland 1.0 (xdg-utils), a set of common interfaces for desktop environments. freedesktop.org joined the X.Org Foundation in 2019. Some of the project&#x27;s servers are hosted by Portland State University.

==Hosted projects==
freedesktop.org provides hosting for a number of relevant projects. These include:

===Windowing system and graphics===

Software related to windowing systems and graphics in general
* Cairo, a vector graphics library with cross-device output support
* Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI), a Linux API to access the graphics hardware, used by X11, Wayland compositors, Mesa 3D, etc.
* Glamor, a 2D graphics common driver for X server on graphics chipsets which have support for OpenGL/EGL/GBM APIs
* Mesa 3D, an implementation of several graphics APIs such as Vulkan and OpenGL
* Pixman, a low-level software library for pixel manipulation, providing features such as image compositing and trapezoid rasterization; users include the cairo graphics library and the X.Org Server
* Poppler, a PDF rendering library
* Video Acceleration API
* Wayland, a protocol to replace X11; features: no tearing, lag, redrawing or flicker
* X.Org Server, the official reference implementation of the X11 protocol
* XCB, an Xlib replacement
* Xephyr, a display server
* wlroots, a modular Wayland compositor library

===Other===

* D-Bus, a message bus akin to DCOP (KDE 3) and Bonobo (GNOME 2)
* Elektra, a library for reading and writing configuration
*FreeType, a text rendering library
* fontconfig, a library for font discovery, name substitution, etc.
* fprint, a library for consumer fingerprint reader devices
* Geoclue, a geoinformation service
* GStreamer, a cross-platform multimedia framework
* GTK-Qt engine, a GTK+ 2 engine which uses Qt to draw the graphical control elements, providing the look and feel of KDE applications to GTK+2 applications
* HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer), a consistent cross-operating system layer; deprecated and replaced by udev
* kmscon, a userspace virtual console to replace the Linux console; uses the KMS driver and supports Unicode
* luit, a tool used by terminal emulators
* libinput, a library to handle input devices in Wayland compositors and to provide a generic X.Org input driver. It provides device detection, device handling, input device event processing and abstraction to minimize the amount of custom input code compositors need to provide the common set of functionality that users expect.
* PulseAudio, a sound server frontend providing software mixing, network audio, and per application volume control
* PipeWire, a low-latency server for handling sandbox-friendly audio and video streams on Linux, which provides an implementation of PulseAudio, JACK, and ALSA as well as secure methods for screenshotting and screencasting on Wayland compositors
* systemd, a comprehensive init framework to start and manage services and sessions meant to replace older init models
* Xft, anti-aliased fonts using the FreeType library, rather than the old X core fonts
* pkg-config, a helper program used to generate flags for compiler and linker to include necessary libraries
Also, Avahi (a free Zeroconf implementation) started as a fd.o project but has since become a separate project.

=== Base Directory Specification ===

&quot;XDG Base Directory Specification&quot; (XDG BDS) introduces a range of variables where user-specific files used by programs should be found. Many tools and applications utilize these variables by default. 

==== User directories ====
Besides the variables mentioned below, XDG BDS also specifies that users&#x27; local binary files may be installed into . Systems compliant with the spec are expected to make this directory available in their CLI&#x27;s environment variable.
: For user application&#x27;s own data files
: Default to 
: For user&#x27;s app configuration files
: Default to 
: For user-specific app session data, which should be stored for future reuse
: Default to 
: May include logs, recently used files, application-specific information (e.g. window layout, views, opened files, undo history, etc.), akin to session data that should be stored by app by request of system session manager, like X session manager
: For user-specific apps cache files
: Default to 
: For user-specific app runtime files like sockets which must not survive reboot and full logout/login cycles

==== System directories ====
: Colon-separated list of preference-ordered paths to search for data files in
: Default to 
: The same as above but for config files
: Default to 

==Stated aims==
The project aims to catch interoperability issues much earlier in the process. It is not for legislating formal standards. Stated goals include:

* Collect existing specifications, standards, and documents related to X desktop interoperability and make them available in a central location.
* Promote the development of new specifications and standards to be shared among multiple X desktops.
* Integrate desktop-specific standards into broader standards efforts, such as Linux Standard Base and the ICCCM.
* Work on the implementation of these standards in specific X desktops.
* Serve as a neutral forum for sharing ideas about X desktop technology.
* Implement technologies that further X desktop interoperability and free X desktops in general.
* Promote X desktops and X desktop standards to application authors, both commercial and volunteer.
* Communicate with the developers of free operating system kernels, the X Window System itself, free OS distributions, and so on to address desktop-related problems.
* Provide source repositories (git and CVS), web hosting, Bugzilla, mailing lists, and other resources to free software projects that work toward the above goals.

<doc id="426392" wikidata="Q1768718" url="?curid=426392" title="An Unearthly Child">
<text>An Unearthly Child (sometimes referred to as 100,000 BC) is the first serial of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. It was first broadcast on BBC TV in four weekly parts from 23 November to 14 December 1963. Scripted by Australian writer Anthony Coburn, the serial introduces William Hartnell as the First Doctor and his original companions: Carole Ann Ford as the Doctor&#x27;s granddaughter, Susan Foreman, with Jacqueline Hill and William Russell as school teachers Barbara Wright and Ian Chesterton. The first episode deals with Ian and Barbara&#x27;s discovery of the Doctor and his time-space ship, the TARDIS, in a junkyard in contemporary London, and the remaining episodes are set amid a power struggle between warring Stone Age factions who have lost the secret of making fire.

The show was created to fill a gap between children&#x27;s and young adult programming. Canadian producer Sydney Newman, recently made Head of Drama at the BBC, was tasked with creating the show, with heavy contributions from Donald Wilson and C. E. Webber. Newman conceived the idea of the TARDIS, as well as the central character of the Doctor. Production was led by Verity Lambert, the BBC drama department&#x27;s first female producer, and the serial was directed by Waris Hussein. Following several delays, the first episode was recorded in September 1963 on 405-line black and white videotape, but was re-recorded the following month due to several technical and performance errors. Several changes were made to the show&#x27;s costuming, effects, performances, and scripts throughout production.

The show&#x27;s launch was overshadowed by the assassination of American President John F. Kennedy the previous day, resulting in a repeat of the first episode the following week. The serial received mixed reviews, and the four episodes attracted an average of six million viewers. Retrospective reviews of the serial are favourable. It later received several print adaptations and home media releases.

== Plot ==
At Coal Hill School, teachers Ian Chesterton and Barbara Wright have concerns about pupil Susan Foreman, who has an alien outlook on England. When the teachers visit her address to investigate, they find a police box and hear Susan&#x27;s voice inside, as an elderly man arrives and refuses to let the teachers into the police box. They force their way in to find Susan inside a technologically advanced control room that is larger than the police box exterior. Susan explains that the object is a time and space machine called the TARDIS and the old man is her grandfather, who reveals that he and his granddaughter are exiles from their own planet. Refusing to let Ian and Barbara leave, he sets the TARDIS in flight and the ship goes through time and space to the Stone Age.

Za, the leader of a primitive Paleolithic tribe, attempts to make fire. A young woman called Hur warns him that if he fails to do so, the stranger called Kal will be made leader. After exiting the TARDIS, the unnamed old man, whom Ian and Barbara refer to as &quot;the Doctor&quot;, is ambushed by Kal, when he witnesses him light a match. Kal takes the Doctor back to the tribe and threatens to kill him if he does not make fire; Ian, Barbara and Susan intervene, but the group is imprisoned in a large cave. With the help of Old Mother, who believes that fire will bring death to the tribe, they escape from the settlement but are intercepted and recaptured before reaching the TARDIS. Kal says they will be sacrificed if they do not make fire. While Ian tries to start a fire, Kal enters the cave and attacks Za, but is killed. Ian gives a burning torch to Za, who shows it to the tribe and declares himself leader. Susan notices that placing a skull over a burning torch makes it appear alive; when the tribe enters the cave, they are faced with several burning skulls, and are terrified, allowing the group to flee to the TARDIS and escape through time and space to a silent and unknown forest. Unnoticed by the crew as they leave the ship to investigate, the radiation meter rises to &quot;Danger&quot;.

==Production==
===Conception===

In March 1963, BBC Television&#x27;s Controller of Programmes Donald Baverstock informed Head of Drama Sydney Newman of a gap in the schedule on Saturday evenings between the sports showcase &quot;Grandstand&quot; and the pop music programme &quot;Juke Box Jury&quot;. Baverstock figured that the programme should appeal to three audiences: children who had previously been accustomed to viewing television during the timeslot, the teenage audience of &quot;Juke Box Jury&quot;, and the adult sports fan audience of &quot;Grandstand&quot;. Newman decided that a science fiction programme should fill the gap. Head of the Script Department Donald Wilson and writer C.E. Webber contributed heavily to the formatting of the programme, and co-wrote the programme&#x27;s first format document with Newman; the latter conceived the idea of a time machine larger on the inside than the outside, as well as the central character of the mysterious &quot;Doctor&quot;, and the name &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Production was initiated several months later and handed to producer Verity Lambert—the BBC&#x27;s first female drama producer—and story editor David Whitaker to oversee, after a brief period when the show had been handled by a &quot;caretaker&quot; producer, Rex Tucker.

===Casting and characters===
In Webber&#x27;s original production documents, the character of the Doctor (referred to as &quot;Dr. Who&quot;) was a suspicious and malign character who hated scientists and inventors, and had a secret intention to destroy or nullify the future; Newman rejected this idea, wanting the character to be a father figure. Tucker offered the role of the Doctor to Hugh David; having spent a year working on &quot;Knight Errant Limited&quot; and not wanting to be tied to another series, David turned down the role. Tucker envisioned a young actor to play the Doctor with aged make-up; however, Lambert favoured an older actor to avoid preparation time and add authenticity to the role. The part was turned down by actors Leslie French, Cyril Cusack, Alan Webb and Geoffrey Bayldon; Cusack and Webb were reluctant to work for a year on a series, while Bayldon wished to avoid another &quot;old man&quot; role. Lambert and director Waris Hussein invited William Hartnell to play the role; after several discussions, Hartnell accepted, viewing it as an opportunity to take his career in a new direction.
The Doctor&#x27;s companion was originally named Bridget or &quot;Biddy&quot;, a 15-year-old girl eager for life. Her teachers were Miss Lola McGovern, a 24-year-old timid woman capable of sudden courage, and Cliff, a &quot;physically perfect, strong and courageous&quot; man. Bridget was renamed Suzan/Suzanne Foreman, later changed to Susan, and writer Anthony Coburn made her the Doctor&#x27;s granddaughter to avoid any possibility of sexual impropriety implicit in having a young girl travelling with an older man; Newman was reluctant about the idea, as he wanted the character to have human naivety. Miss McGovern later became history teacher Miss Canning, and Susan&#x27;s birth name briefly became &quot;Findooclare&quot;. When the show&#x27;s bible was written, the two teachers were renamed Ian Chesterton and Barbara Wright. Chesterton was much more violent in earlier drafts of the script. William Russell was chosen to portray Ian, being the only actor considered by Lambert to do so. Tucker held auditions for the roles of Susan and Barbara on 25 June 1963; actresses Christa Bergmann, Anne Castaldini, Maureen Crombie, Heather Fleming, Camilla Hasse, Waveney Lee, Anna Palk and Anneke Wills were all considered for the role of Susan, while Sally Home, Phyllida Law and Penelope Lee were considered for Barbara. Following Tucker&#x27;s departure from production, Lambert was in talks with actress Jacqueline Lenya to play Susan, but the role was ultimately given to Carole Ann Ford, a 23-year-old who typically played younger roles. Lambert&#x27;s friend Jacqueline Hill was chosen to play Barbara.

===Writing===
The programme was originally intended to open with a serial entitled &quot;The Giants&quot;, written by Webber, but was scrapped by June 1963 as the technical requirements of the storyline—which involved the leading characters being drastically reduced in size—were beyond their capabilities, and the story itself lacked the necessary impact for an opener. Due to the lack of scripts ready for production, the untitled second serial from Coburn was moved to first in the running order. The order change necessitated rewriting the opening episode of Coburn&#x27;s script to include some introductory elements of Webber&#x27;s script for the first episode of &quot;The Giants&quot;. Coburn also made several significant original contributions to the opening episode, mostly notably that the Doctor&#x27;s time machine should resemble a police box, an idea he conceived after seeing a real police box while walking near his office.

===Filming===
The show remained unnamed in April 1963, simply referred to as &quot;The Saturday Serial&quot;. It was provisionally scheduled to begin recording on 5 July, to be aired on 27 July, but was delayed. A pilot recording was scheduled to begin filming on 19 July; if successful, it could be broadcast on 24 August. Production was later deferred for a further two weeks while scripts were prepared, and the recording on 19 July was rescheduled as a test session for the dematerialisation effect of the TARDIS. The show&#x27;s initial broadcast date was pushed back to 9 November, with the pilot recording scheduled for 27 September and regular episodes made from 18 October; the broadcast date was soon pushed back to 16 November, due to the BBC&#x27;s athletics coverage in July pushing subsequent Saturday transmissions back a week, and later to 23 November. The show was granted a budget of £2,300 per episode (), with an additional £500 for the construction of the TARDIS ().

Tucker was originally selected as the serial&#x27;s director, but the task was assigned to Hussein following Tucker&#x27;s departure from production. Some of the pre-filmed inserts for the serial, shot at Ealing Studios in September and October 1963, were directed by Hussein&#x27;s production assistant Douglas Camfield. The first version of the opening episode was recorded at Lime Grove Studios on the evening of 27 September 1963, following a week of rehearsals. However, the recording was bedevilled with technical errors, including the doors leading into the TARDIS control room failing to close properly. After viewing the episode, Newman ordered that it be mounted again. During the weeks between the two tapings, changes were made to costuming, effects, performances, and scripts. The second attempt at the opening episode was recorded on 18 October, with the following three episodes being recorded weekly from 25 October to 8 November. Recording for the five episodes (including the pilot) cost a total of , which Lambert noted was within the programme&#x27;s budget.

==Themes and analysis==
Scholar Mark Bould discusses how the serial establishes &quot;Doctor Who&quot; socio-political stances in his 2008 essay &quot;Science Fiction Television in the United Kingdom&quot;. He writes, &quot;The story represents the separation/reunion, capture/escape, pursuit/evasion that will dominate the next twenty-six years, as well as the programme&#x27;s consistent advocacy of the BBC&#x27;s political and social liberalism.&quot; He cites Ian and Barbara&#x27;s attempt to teach a cavewoman kindness, friendship and democracy, writing &quot;a tyrant is not as strong as the whole tribe acting collectively&quot;. Scholar John R. Cook reflected in 1999 that the presence of teachers as companions echoes &quot;Doctor Who&quot; original educational remit. Malcolm Peltu of &quot;New Scientist&quot; noted, in 1982, that the serial was set in the Stone Age because the show&#x27;s original intention was &quot;to bring to life the Earth&#x27;s history&quot;.

Lawrence Miles and Tat Wood argue that the cavemen&#x27;s focus on fire is meant to stand in for all technology, thus linking the latter three episodes with the questions of generational change raised by the first episode and its focus on suspicion of children, and tying that to a discussion of technological progress, including the nuclear bomb. They also argue that, contrary to the tendency to treat the story as a one-episode introduction to the series followed by &quot;three episodes of running around and escaping&quot; that the piece should be considered as a single, dramatic whole that is &quot;about making four people who barely know one another learn to trust each other&quot;.

==Reception==
===Broadcast and ratings===


The first episode was transmitted at 5:16:20p.m. on Saturday 23 November 1963. The assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy the previous day overshadowed the launch of the series; as a result, the first episode was repeated a week later, on 30 November, preceding the second episode. The first episode was watched by 4.4 million viewers (9.1% of the viewing audience), and it received a score of 63 on the Appreciation Index; the repeat of the first episode reached a larger audience of six million viewers. Across its four episodes, &quot;An Unearthly Child&quot; was watched by an average of 6 million (12.3% of potential viewers). Episodes 2–4 achieved ratings of 5.9, 6.9 and 5.4 million viewers, respectively. Mark Bould suggests that a disappointing audience reaction and high production costs prompted the BBC&#x27;s chief of programmes to cancel the series until the Daleks, introduced in the second serial in December 1963, were immediately popular with viewers.

The serial has been repeated twice on the BBC: on BBC2 in November 1981, as part of the repeat season &quot;The Five Faces of Doctor Who&quot;, achieving average audience figures of 4.3 million viewers; and on BBC Four as part of the show&#x27;s 50th anniversary on 21 November 2013, achieving an average of 630,000 viewers.

===Critical response===
The serial initially received mixed reviews from television critics. Michael Gower of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; wrote a short favourable review of the first episode, claiming that the ending &quot;must have delighted the hearts of the &quot;Telegoons&quot; who followed&quot;. A reviewer in the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; stated that they &quot;intend following closely&quot; to the show, describing the ending as &quot;satisfying&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; felt that the script &quot;suffered from a glibness of characterisations which didn&#x27;t carry the burden of belief&quot;, but praised the &quot;effective camerawork&quot;, noting that the show &quot;will impress if it decides to establish a firm base in realism&quot;. After the second episode, Mary Crozier of &quot;The Guardian&quot; was unimpressed by the serial, stating that it &quot;has fallen off badly soon after getting underway&quot;; she felt that the first episode &quot;got off the ground predictably, but there was little to thrill&quot;, while the second was &quot;a depressing sequel ... wigs and furry pelts and clubs were all ludicrous&quot;. Conversely, Marjorie Norris of &quot;Television Today&quot; commented that if the show &quot;keeps up the high standard of the first two episodes it will capture a much wider audience&quot;.

Retrospective reviews are mostly positive towards &quot;An Unearthly Child&quot;. In 1980, John Peel described the story as &quot;a work of loving craftsmanship, worked out to perfection by all concerned&quot;. Referring to the serial while discussing the early years of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in 1982, &quot;New Scientist&quot;″s Peltu praised the script, acting and direction, but criticised the dated scenery. In &quot;The Discontinuity Guide&quot; (1995), Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping described the first episode as &quot;twenty-five of the most important minutes in British television&quot;, particularly praising the directorial techniques, but felt that the following three episodes declined in quality. In &quot;The Television Companion&quot; (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker lauded Hartnell&#x27;s performance and the reveal of the TARDIS interior in the first episode, and felt that the following three episodes were lesser in quality but remained &quot;intense&quot; and &quot;highly dramatic&quot;. In &quot;A Critical History of Doctor Who&quot; (1999), John Kenneth Muir called the serial &quot;an unqualified success as drama&quot;, applauding the writing, cinematic style, and production techniques.

In 2008, &quot;Radio Times&quot; reviewer Patrick Mulkern praised the casting of Hartnell, the &quot;moody&quot; direction and the &quot;thrilling&quot; race back to the TARDIS. Christopher Bahn of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; in 2010 labelled &quot;An Unearthly Child&quot; an essential serial to watch for background on the programme. In his review, he noted that the first episode is &quot;brilliantly done; the next three together could be about a half-hour shorter but get the job done&quot;. He praised the characters of Ian, Barbara, and the mysterious Doctor, but noted that he was far from the character he would become and Susan was &quot;something of a cipher&quot; with the hope she would develop later. In a 2006 review, DVD Talk&#x27;s John Sinnott called the first episode &quot;excellent&quot;, but felt the &quot;story goes down hill a bit&quot; with the introduction of the prehistoric time period. He cited the slower pace, the discussions in &quot;Tarzan-speak&quot;, and the lack of tension or high stakes.

==Commercial releases==
===In print===
Writer David Whitaker omitted &quot;An Unearthly Child&quot; from the first spin-off novelisation, &quot;Doctor Who in an Exciting Adventure with the Daleks&quot; (later retitled &quot;Doctor Who and the Daleks&quot; and &quot;Doctor Who – The Daleks&quot;), with Ian and Barbara&#x27;s entrance into the TARDIS leading directly into an adaptation of the second televised serial, &quot;The Daleks&quot;. Historian James Chapman highlights this as a reason that, in an age before home video, many people believed the Dalek serial to be the first &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story because the novelisations published by Target Books were the &quot;closest that fans had to the original programmes&quot;. Terrance Dicks wrote the Target novelisation of this story, initially published as &quot;Doctor Who and an Unearthly Child&quot; on 15 October 1981 with a cover by Andrew Skilleter. The release also received several translations worldwide. A verbatim transcript of the transmitted version of this serial, edited by John McElroy and titled &quot;The Tribe of Gum&quot;, was published by Titan Books in January 1988. It was the first in an intended series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; script books. In 1994, a phonecard with a photomontage of the episode was released by Jondar International Promotions.

===Home media===
The story was originally released on VHS on 5 February 1990, with a cover designed by Alister Pearson. The unaired pilot was released as part of &quot;The Hartnell Years&quot; on 3 June 1991, and with &quot;Doctor Who: The Edge of Destruction and Dr Who: The Pilot Episode&quot; on 1 May 2000. A remastered version of the serial was also released on VHS on 4 September 2000; for the DVD release on 30 January 2006, the serial was released as part of &quot;Doctor Who: The Beginning&quot; alongside the following two serials, with several special features, including audio commentaries and comedy sketches. It was also released in the US and Canada on 27 May 2014 as part of the Blu-ray set for &quot;An Adventure in Space and Time&quot;.

In October 2023, the BBC announced that &quot;An Unearthly Child&quot; would not be available on its iPlayer service the following month alongside other &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episodes as it did not hold the entire copyright. Coburn&#x27;s son, Stef Coburn, claimed he had withdrawn the licensing rights following disagreements over compensation. Stef Coburn had previously requested recognition and compensation for his father&#x27;s work in 2013 but said he did not wish to withdraw licensing rights at the time. He had since lambasted the programme&#x27;s direction, claiming in 2023 that his father would be &quot;outrage[d] at what generations of progressively more corrupted BBC filth have done&quot;, in response to the casting of actors Ncuti Gatwa and Jinkx Monsoon. Scenes featuring dialogue from &quot;An Unearthly Child&quot; were removed from the 2023 repeat of &quot;An Adventure in Space and Time&quot;, which many attributed to the licensing issues.

<doc id="426396" wikidata="Q1408535" url="?curid=426396" title="Festival Speech Synthesis System">
<text>The Festival Speech Synthesis System is a general multi-lingual speech synthesis system originally developed by Alan W. Black, Paul Taylor and Richard Caley at the Centre for Speech Technology Research (CSTR) at the University of Edinburgh. Substantial contributions have also been provided by Carnegie Mellon University and other sites. It is distributed under a free software license similar to the BSD License.

It offers a full text to speech system with various APIs, as well as an environment for development and research of speech synthesis techniques. It is written in C++ with a Scheme-like command interpreter for general customization and extension.

Festival is designed to support multiple languages, and comes with support for English (British and American pronunciation), Welsh, and Spanish. Voice packages exist for several other languages, such as Castilian Spanish, Czech, Finnish, Hindi, Italian, Marathi, Polish, Russian and Telugu.

==Festvox==
The Festvox project aims to make the building of new synthetic voices more systematic and better documented, making it possible for anyone to build a new voice. It is distributed under a free software license similar to the MIT License.

Festvox is a suite of tools by Alan W. Black and Kevin Lenzo for building synthetic voices for Festival. It includes a step-by-step tutorial with examples in document called &quot;Building Synthetic Voices&quot;.

==Flite==
Flite is a small run-time speech synthesis engine developed at Carnegie Mellon University, derived from both Festival and Festvox.

==Linux compatibility==
There is a Festival plug-in for GStreamer. Festival is pre-packaged for several Linux distributions.

<doc id="426399" wikidata="Q603476" url="?curid=426399" title="Caul">
<text>A caul is a piece of membrane that can cover a newborn&#x27;s head and face. Birth with a caul is rare, occurring in less than 1 in 80,000 births. The caul is harmless and is immediately removed by the attending parent, physician, or midwife upon birth of the child.

An en-caul birth is different from a caul birth in that the infant is born inside the entire amniotic sac (instead of just a portion of it). The sac balloons out at birth, with the amniotic fluid and child remaining inside the unbroken or partially broken membrane.

==Types==
A child &#x27;born with the caul&#x27; has a portion of a birth membrane remaining on the head. There are two types of caul membranes, and such cauls can appear in four ways.

The most common caul type is a piece of the thin translucent inner lining of the amnion that breaks away and forms tightly against the head during birth. Such a caul typically clings to the head and face but on rarer occasions drapes over the head and partly down the torso.

==Removal==
The caul is harmless and is immediately removed by the attending parent, physician, or midwife upon birth of the child. If the membrane is of the amniotic tissue, it is removed by easily slipping it away from the child&#x27;s skin. The removal of the thicker membrane is more complex. If done correctly, the attending practitioner will make a small incision in the membrane across the nostrils so that the child can breathe. The loops are then carefully removed from behind the ears. The remainder of the caul is then either peeled back very carefully from the skin or else gently rubbed with a sheet of paper, which is then peeled away. If removed too quickly, the caul can leave wounds on the infant&#x27;s flesh at the attachment points, which might leave permanent scars.

==Epidemiology==
Birth with a caul is rare, occurring in fewer than 1 in 80,000 births. This statistic includes en-caul births, which occur more frequently than authentic caul births; therefore, authentic caul births are even more rare than indicated by the raw statistic. Most en-caul births are premature.

==Folk traditions==
According to Aelius Lampridius, the boy-emperor Diadumenian (208–218) was so named because he was born with a diadem formed by a rolled caul.

In medieval times, the appearance of a caul on a newborn baby was seen as a sign of good luck. It was considered an omen that the child was destined for greatness. Gathering the caul onto paper was considered an important tradition of childbirth: the midwife would rub a sheet of paper across the baby&#x27;s head and face, pressing the material of the caul onto the paper. The caul would then be presented to the mother, to be kept as an heirloom. Some Early Modern European traditions linked caul birth to the ability to defend fertility and the harvest against the forces of evil, particularly witches and sorcerers.

Folklore developed suggesting that possession of a baby&#x27;s caul would bring its bearer good luck and protect that person from death by drowning. Cauls were therefore highly prized by sailors. Medieval women often sold them to sailors for large sums of money; a caul was regarded as a valuable talisman.

In Polish the idiom &#x27; (&#x27;born in a bonnet&#x27;), in Italian &#x27; (&#x27;born with a shirt&#x27;) and in French &quot;né(e) coiffé(e)&quot; (&#x27;born with a hat on&#x27;) all describe a person who is always very lucky.

The Russian phrase (&quot;rodilsya v rubashke&quot;, literally &#x27;born in a shirt&#x27;) refers to caul birth and means &#x27;born lucky&#x27;. It is often applied to someone who is oblivious to an impending disaster that is avoided only through luck, as if the birth caul persists as supernatural armor, and in this sense commonly appears in titles or descriptions of Russian dashcam videos.

Not all cultural beliefs about cauls are positive. In Romanian folklore babies born with a caul are said to become strigoi upon death. It was also believed that &quot;he who is born to be hanged will never drown&quot; - that anyone born with a caul was destined to leave the world in a hangman&#x27;s hood in place of the caul with which they were born. The belief in cauls as omens persisted well into the 20th century.

The 16th-century Dutch physician Levinus Lemnius, author of &quot;The Secret Miracles of Nature&quot;, remained skeptical of superstitious claims about preserved cauls. Comic writer Thomas Hood even ended his poem &quot;The Sea-Spell&quot; with a lament about a drowning sailor&#x27;s futile reliance on a protection charm:

==In popular culture==
In the classic 1850 novel &quot;David Copperfield&quot; by Charles Dickens, the title character and novel narrator describes his own birth: &quot;I was born with a caul, which was advertised for sale, in the newspapers, at the low price of fifteen guineas.&quot; Copperfield goes on to describe the fate of his caul, which was re-sold and raffled over the subsequent decade as a talisman believed to protect its owner from death by drowning.

In the novel &quot;Oscar and Lucinda&quot; by Peter Carey, Theophilus Hopkins, father of the hero, Oscar, gives to his son a little box, inside which there is &quot;a caul, the little membrane that had covered Oscar&#x27;s head at birth and it had been kept, his mother had kept it, because it was said – superstitiously, of course – that such a thing would protect the child from drowning&quot;.

An &quot;en caul&quot; birth is depicted in the episode &quot;Heavy Hangs the Head&quot; (S03E01) of the Apple TV+ science fiction series &quot;See&quot;.

Other depictions include:
* In 1980 horror film &quot;The Shining&quot;, Danny Torrance is born with a caul, possibly causing his clairvoyant abilities.
* In Barbara Kingsolver&#x27;s novel &quot;Demon Copperhead&quot; (2022), the protagonist is born with a caul, with the superstition that he could not die by drowning.

<text>The Scotland Office (Scottish Gaelic: &quot;An Oifis Albannach&quot;), known as the Office of the Secretary of State for Scotland from 2018 to 2024, is a department of His Majesty&#x27;s Government headed by the secretary of state for Scotland and responsible for Scottish affairs that lie within HM Government&#x27;s responsibility.

The department evolved from the Scottish Office which was formed in 1885. It was renamed the Scotland Office in 1999 following devolution in Scotland, where the majority of its responsibilities were transferred to the Scottish Executive (since renamed the Scottish Government).

==Responsibilities==
The office is responsible for the representation of Scotland and Scottish affairs in the UK Government, facilitating the smooth operation of devolution, liaising between the central Government and the Scottish Government at Edinburgh and the administering of certain reserved matters of government relating to Scotland.

The department sponsors one non-departmental public body, the Boundary Commission for Scotland.

==History==
Until the advent of the Scottish Parliament and the devolved Scottish Government, the Scottish Office (the precursor to the Scotland Office) was a major UK government department dealing with most aspects of the domestic governance of Scotland, a position known as &quot;administrative devolution&quot;.

Since devolution, its powers are limited to those relating to reserved matters that are not dealt with by other departments of HM Government as well as relations with the devolved bodies. Along with the Wales Office, the Scotland Office has shared administrative functions first with the 2007 Department for Constitutional Affairs and later the Ministry of Justice. The Secretary of State for Scotland also holds certain powers of oversight over the operation of the Scottish Parliament under the Scotland Act 1998.

Donald Dewar, who held the office from 1997–99, resigned to become the inaugural First Minister of Scotland following devolution on 17 May 1999. Under the Blair Ministry and Brown Ministry, the office of secretary of state for Scotland was sometimes held along with another Cabinet role. These cases were Alistair Darling, who served as Secretary of State for Scotland between 2003 and 2006 while also being Secretary of State for Transport. When Douglas Alexander took on the role in 2006 he also held the additional Transport office. His successor Des Browne, who was Secretary of State from 2007–08, was simultaneously the secretary of state for defence. Jim Murphy was appointed to the office in 2008, which remained his only government position until the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition gained power in 2010. The position was then held by Liberal Democrat Members of Parliament until the Conservative government came into office following the 2015 general election.

Between 2015 and 2018, the Scotland Office rebranded much of its output under a UK Government in Scotland branding, with the office itself then becoming known as the Office of the Secretary of State for Scotland. Similar changes were made in relation to the Wales Office. Both departments reverted to their original names in 2024.

==Ministers==

The Scotland Office ministers are as follows, with cabinet members in bold:

==Location==
The department is based across two sites, one in Edinburgh and the other in London. Dover House in Whitehall has been used as the London base of the office and its predecessors since 1885. It also provides accommodation for the Office of the Advocate General for Scotland and other government bodies.

Since 2020, its base in Edinburgh is Queen Elizabeth House, which was earmarked to be a UK Government hub in the city bringing together around 3,000 UK Government civil servants across a variety of government departments. Between 1999 and 2020, it was located in premises at Melville Crescent.

Prior to devolution, the Scottish Office had a number of facilities in Scotland that are now generally operated by the devolved Scottish Government. This includes St Andrew&#x27;s House and Victoria Quay.
== Management ==
The following have been head of the Scotland Office (since 2009, this position has been called &quot;Director of the Scotland Office&quot;):
* 1999–2002: Ian William Gordon (as Head of Department)
* 2002–2005: David Jonathan Crawley (as Head of Department)
* 2005–2007: James Richmond Wildgoose (as Head of Department)
* 2007–2009: David Fraser Middleton (as Head of Department; later CBE)
* 2009–2012: Alisdair Douglas McIntosh
* 2012–2015: Alun Trevor Bernard Evans, CBE
* 2015–2017: Francesca Osowska

<text>The Scottish Office was a department of the Government of the United Kingdom from 1885 until 1999, exercising a wide range of government functions in relation to Scotland under the control of the Secretary of State for Scotland. Following the establishment of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, most of its work was transferred to the newly established Scottish Executive (now officially the Scottish Government), with a small residue of functions retained by the Scotland Office.

==History==
Following the Act of Union 1707 and the adjournment of the old Parliament of Scotland, the post of Secretary of State for Scotland was established within the government of the Kingdom of Great Britain. The Secretary of State was entrusted with general responsibility for the governance of Scotland, with the Lord Advocate acting as chief law officer in Scotland. The post of Secretary of State for Scotland was abolished in 1746, and the Lord Advocate assumed responsibility for government business in Scotland. In 1828 the Home Secretary was formally put &quot;in charge of Scotland&quot;, but the Lord Advocate continued to be the voice of Scotland in the government and took the lead in Scottish debates.

During the nineteenth century, the functions of government increased, particularly at a local level dealing with issues such as public health, poor law relief, roads and education, and local authorities were active in providing water supplies, drainage, hospitals and town planning. To exercise control over these local activities, a number of supervisory boards such as the Board of Supervision for Poor Relief (1845–1894), the General Board of Commissioners in Lunacy (1857–1913) and the Scotch Education Department (a committee of the Privy Council) were established. However the accountability of these boards was not clear, they were staffed by amateurs and they increased the scope for government patronage. In 1869 Scottish MPs asked Gladstone to appoint a Scottish Secretary with responsibility for the boards, but the post of Secretary for Scotland, and with it, the Scottish Office, were not created until 1885.

=== Departments ===
By the time the Scottish Office was formed in 1885, a number of institutions of government existed exclusively for Scotland: the Board of Supervision for Poor Relief which had been established in 1828, the Fishery Board which had been limited to Scotland in 1849, the General Board of Commissioners in Lunacy (established in 1857), the Scotch Education Department (established in 1872), and the Prisons Commission, created in 1877. In 1886, a Crofters Commission was established, and lasted until 1911. In 1894, the Board of Supervision for Poor Relief became the Local Government Board for Scotland, and three years later a Congested Districts Board was established and lasted until 1911. To these were added the Scottish Board of Agriculture in 1912, the Highlands and Islands Medical Services Board the following year, and the Scottish Insurance Commissioners in 1911.

These bodies were gradually consolidated and reformed thereafter. In 1919, a Board of Health was formed to bring together and extend the functions of the Insurance Commissioners, Highlands and Islands Medical Services Board, and the Local Government Board for Scotland. This Board, along with the Board of Agriculture and the Prisons Commission were abolished in 1928 and replaced with departments, for Health, Agriculture and Prisons respectively (by the Reorganisation of Offices (Scotland) Act 1928).

The next major phase of reorganisation occurred in 1939, following the Gilmour Committee Report on Scottish Administration; by the Reorganisation of Offices (Scotland) Act 1939, the Scottish Education Department (which is what the Scotch Education Department had been called since 1918), the Department of Health for Scotland, the Department of Agriculture for Scotland, the Prisons Department for Scotland, and the Fishery Board for Scotland had their functions transferred to the Secretary of State. The departments were reformed, with the functions of the Fishery Board and the Prisons Department merged into a new Scottish Home Department. Agriculture, Education and Health were left largely intact and reformed into Departments. The portfolios were widened when the Scottish Office received functions relating to the Crown Estates in 1943 and forestry in 1945, and after the Report of the Royal Commission on Scottish Affairs in 1954.

The departmental structure changed in 1960, when responsibility for fisheries was removed from the Home Office and added the Department of Agriculture (it then became the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries), and in 1962, when the Home and Health departments were merged (into the Scottish Home and Health Department). A new Development Department was also established in 1962. In 1973, they were joined by a new Scottish Economic Planning Department, which was renamed the Scottish Industry Department in 1983. All of the Departments had their names changed in 1991, when &quot;Scottish Office&quot; was prefixed to them, and at the same time the Development Department was renamed to the Scottish Office Environment Department.

The year 1995 brought further changes; the Industry Department was merged with Education to form the Scottish Office Education and Industry Department; the Environment Department reverted to its old name; the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries was renamed the Scottish Office Agriculture, Environment and Fisheries Department; and the Home and Health Department was broken up: the new Scottish Office Home Department was still headed by a permanent secretary, but Scottish Office Health Department was not, instead comprising the Management Executive for NHS in Scotland, the Chief Scientist Office, the Public Health Policy Unit, Medical Services, and Nursing Services.

All of the Departments were abolished in 1999 and most of their functions transferred to the newly formed Scottish Executive.

==Ministers==
The post of Secretary for Scotland was established in 1885. From 1892 the holder sat in Cabinet and in 1926 the post was elevated to the rank of Principal Secretary of State and retitled Secretary of State for Scotland. The addition of responsibility for health functions in 1919 resulted in the creation of a junior ministerial post, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Health for Scotland, which in turn became a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland in 1926.

Additional Parliamentary Under-Secretary posts were added in 1940 and 1951 and a Minister of State post was established in 1951. In 1969-70 one of the Under-Secretary posts was replaced by an additional Minister of State. From 1974 to 1979 there were two Ministers of State and three Under-Secretaries, reverting to one Minister of State in 1979.

== Management ==
When the political office of Secretary for Scotland was established in 1885, a permanent under-secretaryship was created, to be occupied by a civil servant. The first office-holder was Francis Sandford, who had previously been secretary to the Scotch Education Department. When the political office became the Secretary &quot;of State&quot; for Scotland in 1926, the permanent secretary also became formally styled Permanent Under-Secretary &quot;of State&quot; for Scotland. This position was equivalent to Grade 1 in the Civil Service grading structure introduced in 1971.

The several separate Scottish departments which fell under remit of the Scottish Office were each headed by a Secretary (equivalent to Grade 2 in the 1971 structure) who was responsible directly to the Secretary of State, but would meet with the Permanent Under-Secretary of State at the Scottish Office regularly.

In addition, another Grade-2 office – Deputy Secretary (Central Services) – ranked equally with the Secretaries of each of the Departments, and formed part of the Scottish Office&#x27;s management group (along with the Secretaries and Permanent Under-Secretary). The office-holder was responsible for matters of devolution, as well as the financial management of the Office and local authority finance. The office was established in response to the devolution policies of the Labour Government of 1974–79; &quot;it became imperative to create devolution units at high level but separate from the departments&quot;. The office was abolished in 1991. Responsibility for local government finance was then transferred to the Environment Department (formerly the Development Department), while management responsibilities were vested in Gerry Wilson, secretary of the Education Department; this latter arrangement was not intended to be permanent, but reflected the &quot;relative workload&quot; of the different Grade 2 officials.

<text>Solnechnogorsk (, lit. &quot;sunny mountain town&quot;) is a town and the administrative center of Solnechnogorsky District in Moscow Oblast, Russia, located on the Moscow–St. Petersburg Highway and the Moscow–St. Petersburg railway, on the coast of Senezh Lake, northwest from Moscow. Population: 

It was previously known as &quot;Solnechnaya Gora&quot; (until 1938).

==History==
Originally a village known as Solnushnaya and then renamed into Solnechnaya Gora (), it was granted town status and renamed Solnechnogorsk in 1938. During World War II, Solnechnogorsk was briefly occupied by the German 4th Panzer Group from November 24 to December 12, 1941. It was one of the towns that was captured in the northern pincer of the attempted German encirclement of Moscow.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Solnechnogorsk serves as the administrative center of Solnechnogorsky District. As an administrative division, it is, together with twenty-five rural localities, incorporated within Solnechnogorsky District as the Town of Solnechnogorsk. As a municipal division, the Town of Solnechnogorsk is incorporated within Solnechnogorsky Municipal District as Solnechnogorsk Urban Settlement.

==Economy==
Industry in the town is represented by a metal construction factory, a glass-works, a sports fishing business, holiday homes, sport centers, children&#x27;s summer camps, and ski lodges.

==Culture==
There is a museum of local lore in the town. Not far from Solnechnogorsk is the estate of Shakhmatovo that once belonged to a prominent Russian poet Alexander Blok; a museum of him has been opened there.

==Military==
The town is the headquarters for the Main Centre for Missile Attack Warning. The Russian Ground Forces relocated the 18th Motor Rifle Brigade here from the Baltics from 1993 until the brigade was disbanded in 1998.

<doc id="426404" wikidata="Q849736" url="?curid=426404" title="Night terror">
<text>Night terror, also called sleep terror, is a sleep disorder causing feelings of panic or dread and typically occurring during the first hours of stage 3–4 non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and lasting for 1 to 10 minutes. It can last longer, especially in children. Sleep terror is classified in the category of NREM-related parasomnias in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders. There are two other categories: REM-related parasomnias and other parasomnias. Parasomnias are qualified as undesirable physical events or experiences that occur during entry into sleep, during sleep, or during arousal from sleep.

Sleep terrors usually begin in childhood and usually decrease as age increases. Factors that may lead to sleep terrors are young age, sleep deprivation, medications, stress, fever, and intrinsic sleep disorders. The frequency and severity differ among individuals; the interval between episodes can be as long as weeks and as short as minutes or hours. This has created a situation in which any type of nocturnal attack or nightmare may be confused with and reported as a night terror.
Night terrors tend to happen during periods of arousal from delta sleep, or slow-wave sleep. Delta sleep occurs most often during the first half of a sleep cycle, which indicates that people with more delta-sleep activity are more prone to night terrors. However, they can also occur during daytime naps. Night terrors can often be mistaken for confusional arousal.
While nightmares (bad dreams during REM sleep that cause feelings of horror or fear) are relatively common during childhood, night terrors occur less frequently. The prevalence of sleep terrors in general is unknown. The number of small children who experience sleep terror (distinct from sleep terror , which is recurrent and causes distress or impairment) are estimated at 36.9% at 18 months of age and at 19.7% at 30 months. In adults, the prevalence is lower, at only 2.2%. Night terrors have been known since ancient times, although it was impossible to differentiate them from nightmares until rapid eye movement was studied.

==Signs and symptoms==

The universal feature of night terrors is inconsolability—very similar to that of a panic attack. During night terror bouts, sufferers are usually described as &quot;bolting upright&quot; with their eyes wide open and a having look of fear on their face. Individuals with night terrors will often yell, scream, or attempt to speak, but such speech is frequently incomprehensible. Furthermore, they usually sweat, exhibit rapid breathing, and have a rapid heart rate (i.e., autonomic signs). In some cases, individuals are likely to have even more elaborate motor activity, such as a thrashing of limbs—which may include punching, swinging, or fleeing motions. There is a sense that the individuals are trying to protect themselves and/or escape from a possible threat of bodily injury. Although sufferers may seem awake during a night terror, they will appear confused, inconsolable, and/or unresponsive to attempts to communicate with them and may not recognize others familiar to them. Occasionally, when a person with a night terror is awakened, they will lash out at the one awakening them, which can be dangerous to that individual. Most individuals who experience terrors do not remember the incident the next day, although brief dream images or hallucinations may occur and be recalled. Sleepwalking is also common during night terror bouts, as sleepwalking and night terrors manifest the same parasomnia. Both children and adults may display behaviour indicative of attempting to escape a terrifying event; some may thrash about or get out of bed and begin walking or running around aimlessly while inconsolable, increasing the risk of accidental injury. The risk of injury to others may be exacerbated by inadvertent provocation by nearby people, whose efforts to calm the individual may result in a physically violent response from the individual as they attempt to escape.

During polysomnography, individuals with night terrors are known to have very high voltages of electroencephalography (EEG) delta activity, an increase in muscle tone, and a doubled or faster heart rate. Brain activities during a typical episode show theta and alpha activity when monitored with an EEG. Episodes can include tachycardia. Night terrors are also associated with intense autonomic discharge of tachypnea, flushing, diaphoresis, and mydriasis—that is, unconscious or involuntary rapid breathing, reddening of the skin, profuse sweating, and dilation of the pupils. Abrupt but calmer arousal from non-rapid eye movement sleep, short of a full night terror episode, is also common.

In children with night terrors, there is no increased occurrence of psychiatric diagnoses. However, in adults with night terrors, there is a close association with psychopathology and mental disorders. There may be an increased occurrence of night terrors—particularly among those with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). It is also likely that some personality disorders may occur in individuals with night terrors, such as dependent, schizoid, and borderline personality disorders. There have been some symptoms of depression and anxiety that have increased in individuals that have frequent night terrors. Low blood sugar is associated with both pediatric and adult night terrors. A study of adults with thalamic lesions of the brain and brainstem have been occasionally associated with night terrors. Night terrors are closely linked to sleepwalking and frontal lobe epilepsy.

===Children===
Night terrors typically occur in children between the ages of three and twelve years, with a peak onset in children aged three and a half years old.
An estimated 1–6% of children experience night terrors. Children of both sexes and all ethnic backgrounds are affected equally. In children younger than three and a half years old, the peak frequency of night terrors is at least one episode per week (up to 3–4 in rare cases). Among older children, the peak frequency of night terrors is one or two episodes per month. The children will most likely not recollect the episode the next day. Pediatric evaluation may be sought to exclude the possibility that seizure disorders or breathing problems cause night terrors. Most children will outgrow sleep terrors.

===Adults===
Night terrors in adults have been reported in all age ranges. Although the symptoms of night terrors in adolescents and adults are similar, the cause, prognosis, and treatment of symptoms are qualitatively different. These night terrors can occur each night if the individual does not eat a proper diet, get the appropriate amount or quality of sleep (e.g., sleep apnea), well endure stressful events, and if they remain untreated. Adult night terrors are much less common and often respond to treatments to rectify causes of poor quality or quantity of sleep. Night terrors are classified as a mental and behavioral disorder in the ICD. A study on night terrors in adults indicated a prevalence of other psychiatric symptoms among most patients, suggesting potential comorbidity. There is some evidence of a link between night terrors and hypoglycemia.

When a night terror happens, it is typical for a person to wake up yelling and kicking and to be able to recognize what they are saying. The person may even run out of the house (more common among adults), which can then lead to violent actions. It has been found that some adults who have been on a long-term intrathecal clonidine therapy show side effects of night terrors, such as feelings of terror early in the sleep cycle. This is due to the possible alteration of cervical/brain clonidine concentration. In adults, night terrors can be symptomatic of neurological disease and can be further investigated through an MRI procedure.

==Causes==
There is some evidence that a predisposition to night terrors and other parasomnias may be congenital. Individuals frequently report that past family members have had either episodes of sleep terrors or sleepwalking. In some studies, a tenfold increase in the prevalence of night terrors in first-degree biological relatives has been observed—however, the exact link to inheritance is not known. Familial aggregation has been found suggesting that there is an autosomal mode of inheritance. In addition, some laboratory findings suggest that sleep deprivation and having a fever can increase the likelihood of a night terror episode occurring. Other contributing factors include nocturnal asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, central nervous system medications, and a constricted nasal passage. Special consideration must be used when the subject has narcolepsy, as there may be a link. There have been no findings that show a cultural difference between manifestations of night terrors, though it is thought that the significance and cause of night terrors differ within cultures.

Also, older children and adults provide highly detailed and descriptive images associated with their sleep terrors compared to younger children, who either cannot recall or only vaguely remember. Sleep terrors in children are also more likely to occur in males than females; in adults, the ratio between sexes is equal. A longitudinal study examined twins, both identical and fraternal, and found that a significantly higher concordance rate of night terror was found in identical twins than in fraternal.

Though the symptoms of night terrors in adolescents and adults are similar, their causes, prognoses, and treatments are qualitatively different. There is some evidence that suggests that night terrors can occur if the individual does not eat a proper diet, does not get the appropriate amount or quality of sleep (e.g., because of sleep apnea), or is enduring stressful events. Adults who have experienced sexual abuse are more likely to receive a diagnosis of sleep disorders, including night terrors. Overall, though, adult night terrors are much less common and often respond best to treatments that rectify causes of poor quality or quantity of sleep.

==Diagnosis==
The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for sleep terror disorder requires:

* Recurrent periods where the individual abruptly but not completely wakes from sleep, usually occurring during the first third major period of sleep.
* The individual experiences intense fear with a panicky scream at the beginning and symptoms of autonomic arousal, such as increased heart rate, heavy breathing, and increased perspiration. The individual cannot be soothed or comforted during the episode.
* The individual is unable or almost unable to remember images of the dream (only a single visual scene for example).
*The episode is completely forgotten.
* The occurrence of the sleep terror episode causes clinically significant distress or impairment in the individual&#x27;s functioning.
* The disturbance is not due to the effects of a substance, general medical condition or medication.
*Coexisting mental or medical disorders do not explain the episodes of sleep terrors.

=== Differential diagnosis ===
Night terrors are distinct from nightmares. In fact, in nightmares there are almost never vocalization or agitation, and if there are any, they are less strong in comparison to night terrors. In addition, nightmares appear ordinarily during REM sleep in contrast to night terrors, which occur in NREM sleep. Finally, individuals with nightmares can wake up completely and easily and have clear and detailed memories of their dreams.

A distinction between night terrors and epileptic seizure is required. Indeed, an epileptic seizure could happen during the night but also during the day. To make the difference between both of them, an EEG can be done and if there are some anomalies on it, it would rather be an epileptic seizure.

== Assessment ==
The assessment of sleep terrors is similar to the assessment of other parasomnias and must include:

* When the episode occurs during the sleep period
* Age of onset
* How often these episodes occur (frequency) and how long they last for (duration)
* Description of the episode, including behavior, emotions, and thoughts during and after the event
* How responsive the patient is to external stimuli during the episode
* How conscious or aware the patient is, when awakened from an episode
* If the episode is remembered afterwards
* The triggers or precipitating factors
* Sleep–wake pattern and sleep environment
* Daytime sleepiness
* Other sleep disorders that might be present
* Family history for NREM parasomnias and other sleep disorders
* Medical, psychiatric, and neurological history
* Medication and substance use history

Additionally, a home video might be helpful for a proper diagnosis. A polysomnography in the sleep laboratory is recommended for ruling out other disorders, however, sleep terrors occur less frequently in the sleep laboratory than at home and a polysomnography can therefore be unsuccessful at recording the sleep terror episode.

==Treatment==
In most children, night terrors eventually subside and do not need to be treated. It may be helpful to reassure the child and their family that they will outgrow this disorder.

The duration of one episode is mostly brief but it may last longer if parents try to wake up the child. Awakening the child may make their agitation stronger. For all these reasons, it is important to let the sleep terror episode fade away and to just be vigilant in order for them not to fall to the ground.

Considering an episode could be violent, it may be advisable to secure the environment in which the child sleeps. Windows should be closed and potentially dangerous items should be removed from the bedroom, and additionally, alarms can be installed and the child placed in a downstairs bedroom.

There is some evidence to suggest that night terrors can result from lack of sleep or poor sleeping habits. In these cases, it can be helpful to improve the amount and quality of sleep which the child is getting. It is also important to have a good sleep hygiene, if a child has night terrors parents could try to change their sleep hygiene. Another option could be to adapt child&#x27;s naps so that they are not too long or too short. Then, excessive stress or conflicts in a child&#x27;s life could also have an impact on their sleep too, so to have some strategies to cope with stress combined with psychotherapy could decrease the frequency of the episodes. A polysomnography can be recommended if the child continues to have a lot of night terror episodes.

Hypnosis could be efficient. Sleepers could become less sensitive to their sleep terrors.

One technique is to wake up just before the sleep terrors begin. When they appear regularly, this method can prevent their appearance.

Psychotherapy or counseling might be helpful in some cases.

If all these methods are not enough, benzodiazepines (such as diazepam) or tricyclic antidepressants may be used; however, medication is only recommended in extreme cases. Widening the nasal airway by surgical removal of the adenoid was previously considered and demonstrated to be effective; nowadays, however, invasive treatments are generally avoided.

==Research==
A small study of paroxetine found some benefit.

Another small trial found benefit with L-5-hydroxytryptophan (L-5-HTP).

<doc id="426407" wikidata="Q344489" url="?curid=426407" title="Dbx (noise reduction)">
<text>dbx is a family of noise reduction systems developed by the company of the same name. The most common implementations are dbx Type I and dbx Type II for analog tape recording and, less commonly, vinyl LPs. A separate implementation, known as dbx-TV, is part of the MTS system used to provide stereo sound to North American and certain other TV systems. The company, dbx, Inc., was also involved with Dynamic Noise Reduction (DNR) systems.

==History==

The original dbx Type I and Type II systems were based on so-called &quot;linear decibel companding&quot; - compressing the signal on recording and expanding it on playback. It was invented by David E. Blackmer of dbx, Inc. in 1971.

A miniature dbx Type II decoder on an integrated circuit was created in 1982 for use in portable and car audio, although only a few devices took advantage of it, such as certain Panasonic portable cassette players and Sanyo car stereos. dbx marketed the PPA-1 Silencer, a decoder that could be used with non-dbx players such as the Sony Walkman. A version of this chip also contained a Dolby B-compatible noise reduction decoder, described as dbx Type B noise reduction; this was possible after the Dolby patent (but not the trademark) had expired.

Software implementations have been developed.

==How dbx works==
===Tape hiss===
Magnetic tape consists of microscopic particles that can be magnetically charged to record signals. The size of the particles and the speed of the tape transport defines the maximum frequency that the media can record. For high fidelity recordings, reel-to-reel audio tape recording typically works at tape speeds of 15 or 7.5 inches-per-second (38 or 19 cm/s), but this requires a lot of tape for a given amount of recording. Lower fidelity recordings can be made at 3.75 or even 1.875 ips, which allows more recording time on a given tape, but at the cost of adding more high-frequency noise.

The cassette tape was designed for convenience, not audio quality, and ran at 1.875 ips (4.75 cm/s) to maximize recording time in the relatively small (compared to open-reel) tapes. This resulted in significant tape hiss. Combined with their limited width, which limits the dynamic range of the signals, the hiss tended to overwhelm any high frequencies in the signal, especially low-volume ones.

During the 1970s, several new types of magnetic recording films were introduced, notably &quot;chrome&quot; and &quot;metal&quot;, that used smaller particles and thereby pushed the tape hiss to much higher frequencies. During the same period, noise reduction systems like dbx and Dolby attempted to do the same using conventional media and actively addressing the tape noise through electronics.

===Companding===

dbx Type I and Type II are types of &quot;companding noise reduction&quot;. These systems work by first compressing the dynamic range of the signal into a range that can be safely recorded on the tape. This type of compression, dynamic range compression, mutes down loud sounds and amplifies soft ones, making the volume of the recording much more even. On playback, the dynamic range is expanded by the same amount, causing the low-volume sounds to become low-volume again and vice versa. The combination of compression and re-expansion gives rise to the name companding. Companding is useful even outside the field of noise reduction; a cassette might have 40 decibels of dynamic range before the media saturates, while the original signal might use 70 for, say, a live recording of a concert. In this case, companding at 2-to-1 will result in a signal with 35 decibels of range, which can be recorded without clipping.

The reason this technique works for noise reduction is that the tape hiss manifests itself as a constant low-volume signal. When the signal is recorded in its original form, without compression, the amount of hiss may be the same volume as softer sounds, masking them entirely. However, when the signal is compressed before recording, those soft sounds are recorded at a louder volume, so now even the soft sounds are louder than the noise. This improves the signal-to-noise ratio.

When the signal is re-expanded, the tape hiss is expanded along with it, making it louder as well. However, the &quot;ratio&quot; of the signal to noise remains (close to) constant through this process, so the resulting output retains this higher signal-to-noise ratio. Ultimately, it means that while tape hiss does get louder during &quot;soft&quot; portions of the recording, the recording itself is (hopefully) always greater in volume and renders the hiss much less noticeable.

===Pre-emphasis===
Note that the tape hiss is limited to higher frequencies. That means a signal that is primarily low-frequency does not necessarily require noise reduction. Instead, one can simply roll off all the higher frequencies in a low-pass filter, and the hiss will largely disappear.

Consider a signal that contains a high-volume section and then low-volume. During recording, these signals are compressed to be much closer together in level, so that the high-volume section does not saturate the tape and the low-volume section is louder than the tape hiss. On playback, the louder section has little or no muting applied, so the tape hiss is also left alone at its natural volume. When the softer section plays, having been amplified during recording, the expander mutes it down its original level. This also mutes down the tape hiss.

This causes the volume of tape hiss to change during playback. This is not really noticeable when the original signal contains high frequencies that play over the hiss, but for lower frequencies, this can be easily heard. The rise and fall of the tape hiss was known as &quot;breathing&quot; because it sounded like something breathing into a microphone.

To address this, dbx uses strong high-frequency &quot;pre-emphasis&quot; of the original signal. This amplifies high-frequency sounds before they are sent into the compressor. This causes the compressor to &#x27;back off&#x27; the gain in certain circumstances and reduce the audibility of noise modulation – even with this pre-emphasis, noise modulation can become audible when using very noisy media to begin with, such as the cassette format.

===dbx I and II===
dbx Type I system is meant to be used with professional recording media that have a signal-to-noise (S/N), before noise reduction, of at least 60 dB and a -3 dB frequency response of at least 30 Hz to 15 kHz. The system relies on the medium being fairly linear in volume and frequency response.

dbx Type-II is for more noisy media that have a lower S/N and much more restricted frequency response. In the control signal path, the dbx Type II process rolls off the high and low-frequency response to desensitize the system to frequency response errors – since the roll-off is &quot;only&quot; in the control path, it does &quot;not&quot; affect the audible sound. The dbx Type-II &quot;disc&quot; setting on consumer dbx decoders adds an additional 1–3 dB of low-frequency roll-off in both the audio path and control path. This protects the system from audible mistracking due to record warps and low-frequency rumble.

Both systems use 2:1 companding and provide exactly the same amount of noise reduction and dynamic range improvement – in other words, they provide the same end results, but are not compatible with each other.

===dbx vs. Dolby===
Both dbx and the Dolby noise-reduction system use companding to control noise. They differ in the way they address the frequency response of the companding process. dbx uses a single frequency pre-emphasis system, whereas Dolby uses four separate pre-emphasis amplifiers, each for a different frequency band. Since tape hiss is primarily a problem for high-frequency sounds, Dolby uses much stronger pre-emphasis at high frequencies than low. This means that a low-volume, low-frequency signal may see little or no companding, whereas the same volume at high-frequencies will have been strongly pre-emphasized to a higher volume level before compression.

The use of separate pre-emphasizing &quot;encoding curves&quot; allows the overall compression to be much less than it would be on dbx, where it is always 2 to 1. For lower frequency signals, like a conversation, Dolby may apply no compression at all. In contrast, dbx would continue to compand these signals, in which case the tape hiss is also re-expanded on playback, continually varying as the volume changes.

==Lack of dbx acceptance in marketplace==
Although it brought a wider dynamic range, and therefore diminished noise, to the cassette tape medium, dbx noise reduction did not achieve widespread popularity in the consumer marketplace, as compressed recordings did not sound acceptable when played back on non-dbx equipment. Dolby B was already widely used when dbx was introduced. Although Dolby noise reduction also used some companding, the level of compression and expansion was very mild, so that the sound of Dolby-encoded tapes was acceptable to consumers when played back on non-Dolby equipment.
* dbx Type I was widely adopted in professional recording, particularly used with what is referred to in the industry as &quot;semi-pro&quot; formats such as half-inch 8 track and one-inch 16 track. Tascam incorporated dbx Type II in their Portastudio four-track cassette recorders.
* Tascam&#x27;s Portastudio family of 4 track cassette recorders became a standard for home hobbyists.
* An advantage of dbx Type I and Type II compared to Dolby noise reduction is that it did not require calibration with the output level of the tape deck, which could cause incorrect tracking with Dolby B and C, leading to muffled high tones.
* However, due to dbx&#x27;s high compression and strong high-frequency preemphasis, dbx-encoded tapes were, unlike Dolby B, practically unplayable on non-dbx systems, sounding very harsh when played back undecoded. Undecoded dbx playback also exhibited large amounts of dynamic error, with audio levels going up and down constantly.

While dbx Type-II NR was eventually designed into a self-contained LSI chip, it was never cheap due to the extremely high precision required of the dbx VCAs and the RMS signal analysis, leading to further reluctance of manufacturers to use the dbx chips in their products.

==dbx with vinyl phonograph records==
dbx was also used on vinyl records, which were labeled dbx disc. While the earliest release is from 1971/1973, their numbers peaked between 1977/1978 until around 1982. &quot;Billboard&quot; noted in August 1981 that the total number of releases with dbx encoding was expected to approach 200 albums. Discogs mentions 1100 albums. When employed on LPs, the dbx Type-II system reduced the audibility of dust and scratches, reducing them to tiny pops and clicks (if they were audible at all) and also completely eliminated record surface noise. dbx encoded LPs had, in theory, a dynamic range of up to 90 dB. In addition, dbx LPs were produced from only the original master tapes, with no copies being used, and pressed only on heavy, virgin vinyl. Most were released in limited quantities with premium pricing.

==dbx with pro reel tape recorders, as well as other professional/commercial audio production and reproduction==
The dbx K9 noise reduction card was designed to fit into the pro dolby-A series A-361 frames, already in wide use in pro reel-to-reel recording studios of the time.

The full designation of the card is K9-22, which is a dog vs. cat joke. The K9-22 is pin and form-factor compatible with the Dolby card designated and colloquially known as Cat. 22 (K9 is pronounced &quot;canine&quot;).

The dbx 192 was an elegant design made especially for the Nagra IV-Stereo recorder. It had a single push-button for record/playback encode/decode and was integrated directly into the Nagra&#x27;s internal signal path. It drew power from the Nagra supply.

==dbx for television==
dbx-TV noise reduction, while having elements in common with Type I and Type II, is different in fundamental ways, and was developed by Mark Davis (then of dbx, now of Dolby Labs) in the early 1980s.

dbx-TV is included in multichannel television sound (MTS), the U.S. standard for stereo analog television transmission. Every TV device that decoded MTS originally required the payment of royalties, first to dbx, Inc., then to THAT Corporation which was spun off from dbx in 1989 and acquired its MTS patents in 1994; however, those patents expired worldwide in 2004.

==dbx in film production==
dbx noise reduction, capable of more than 20 dB of noise reduction, was used in the re-recording of the film &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; in 1979. Dolby A-type noise reduction, capable of only 10-12 dB of noise reduction, was used only at the final stage for the mastering of the film&#x27;s soundtrack to 70mm prints.

A modified version of dbx was also used in the Colortek stereo film system. In addition, dbx Type-II noise reduction was used in the Model-II and Model-III variants of MCA&#x27;s Sensurround Special Effects System on the optical audio track and was a cornerstone of the entire system. MCA&#x27;s Sensurround+Plus, used on the film Zoot Suit, employed dbx Type-II with the 4-track magnetic sound format on 35mm film prints, providing the motion picture with a stereo soundtrack capable of wide dynamic range and freedom from noise.

==dbx for program delivery via the American NPR Public Radio Satellite System ==

The first generation Public Radio Satellite System (PRSS), introduced in 1979 and used by the American National Public Radio for delivery of network programming to their member stations via satellite, was a single channel per carrier (SCPC) system that had about 40 dB of analog (recovered) signal to noise. dbx modules that were set for 3:1 were used to increase the dynamic range of the system. Typically this worked well but for some low frequencies the distortion exceeded 10 percent THD. Also the dbx modules varied in how they tracked the compressed audio so the expanded audio was not an exact representation of what was compressed at the uplink. Still, the use of dbx allowed NPR to be known for its high fidelity standards on its satellite system as commercial broadcasters chose NPR to up-link a number of commercial radio music programs and concerts by commercial radio networks who demanded high fidelity in the analog era. Many of these problems were resolved when the PRSS moved to their second-generation system in 1994, the SOSS (Satellite Operations Support System), in which the feeds were sent digitally.

<text>Super VGA (SVGA) or Extended VGA is a broad term that covers a wide range of computer display standards that extended IBM&#x27;s VGA specification.

When used as shorthand for a resolution, as VGA and XGA often are, SVGA refers to a resolution of 800 × 600.

==History==

In the late 1980s, after the release of IBM&#x27;s VGA, third-party manufacturers began making graphics cards based on its specifications with extended capabilities. As these cards grew in popularity, they began to be referred to as &quot;Super VGA&quot;.

This term was not an official standard, but a shorthand for enhanced VGA cards which had become common by 1988. The first cards that explicitly used the term were Genoa Systems&#x27;s SuperVGA and SuperVGA HiRes in 1987.

Super VGA cards broke compatibility with the IBM VGA standard, requiring software developers to provide specific display drivers and implementations for each card their software could operate on. Initially, the heavy restrictions this placed on software developers slowed the uptake of Super VGA cards, which motivated VESA to produce a unifying standard, the VESA BIOS Extensions (VBE), first introduced in 1989, to provide a common software interface to all cards implementing the VBE specification.

Eventually, Super VGA graphics adapters supported innumerable modes.

== Specifications ==
The Super VGA standardized the following resolutions:
* 640 × 400 or 640 × 480 with 256 colors
* 800 × 600 with 24-bit color depth
* 1024 × 768 with 24-bit color depth
* 1280 × 1024 with 24-bit color depth 

SVGA uses the same DE-15 VGA connector as the original standard, and otherwise operates over the same cabling and interfaces as VGA.

<text>Hallstatt () is a small town in the district of Gmunden, in the Austrian state of Upper Austria. Situated between the southwestern shore of Hallstätter See and the steep slopes of the Dachstein massif, the town lies in the Salzkammergut region, on the national road linking Salzburg and Graz.

Hallstatt is known for its production of salt, dating back to prehistoric times, and gave its name to the Hallstatt culture, the archaeological culture linked to Proto-Celtic and early Celtic people of the Early Iron Age in Europe, c. 800–450 BC.

Hallstatt is at the core of the Hallstatt-Dachstein/Salzkammergut Cultural Landscape declared as one of the World Heritage Sites in Austria by UNESCO in 1997. It is an area of overtourism.

==History==


During the Bronze Age salt production became day-to-day commercial activity in Hallstatt. Salt was produced in large quantities in evidently highly organized arrangements. Specialist workers supported the salt mining operations. The wealth that was generated is on display in the prehistoric cemeteries in Hallstatt.

In 1846 Johann Georg Ramsauer discovered a large prehistoric cemetery at the Salzberg mines near Hallstatt (), which he excavated during the second half of the 19th century. Eventually the excavation would yield 1,045 burials, although no settlement has yet been found. This may be covered by the later village, which has long occupied the entire narrow strip between the steep hillsides and the lake.

Some 1,300 burials have been found, including around 2,000 individuals, with women and children but few infants. 

The humans that settled Hallstatt exploited the salt mines in the area from the 8th to 5th centuries BC. The style and decoration of the grave goods found in the cemetery are distinctive. In the mine workings themselves, the salt has preserved many organic materials such as textiles, wood, and leather, and many abandoned artefacts such as shoes, pieces of cloth, and tools and miner&#x27;s backpacks have survived in good condition.

Hallstatt A–B are part of the Bronze Age Urnfield culture. Phase A saw Villanovan influence. In this period, people were cremated and buried in simple graves. In phase B, tumulus (barrow or kurgan) burial becomes common, and cremation predominates. Little is known about this period in which the typical Celtic elements have not yet distinguished themselves from the earlier Villanova-culture. The &quot;Hallstatt period&quot; proper is restricted to HaC and HaD (8th to 5th centuries BC), corresponding to the early European Iron Age. Hallstatt lies in the area where the western and eastern zones of the Hallstatt culture meet, which is reflected in the finds from there.

Hallstatt C is characterized by the first appearance of iron swords. Hallstatt D displays daggers, almost to the exclusion of swords, in the western zone graves ranging from circa 600 to 500 BC. There are also differences in the pottery and brooches. Halstatt D has been further divided into the sub-phases D1 to D3 relating only to the western zone.

Major activity at the site appears to have finished about 500 BC, for reasons that are unclear. Many Hallstatt graves were robbed, probably at this time. There was widespread disruption throughout the western Hallstatt zone, and the salt workings had by then become very deep. 

Much of the material from early excavations was dispersed, 

===Romans onwards===
Tourists are told that Hallstatt is the site of &quot;the world&#x27;s oldest pipeline&quot;, which was constructed 400 years ago from 13,000 hollowed-out trees. There is so little space for cemeteries that every ten years bones used to be exhumed and removed into an ossuary, to make room for new burials. A collection of elaborately decorated skulls with the deceased&#x27;s name, profession, and date of death inscribed on them is on display at the local chapel.

===19th century===

Until the late 19th century, it was only possible to reach Hallstatt by boat or via narrow trails. The land between the lake and mountains was sparse, and the town itself exhausted every free patch of it. Access between houses on the river bank was by boat or over the &quot;upper path&quot;, a small corridor passing through attics. The first road to Hallstatt was only built in 1890, along the west shore, partially by rock blasting. Nevertheless, this secluded and inhospitable landscape counts as one of the first places of human settlement due to the rich sources of natural salt, which have been mined for thousands of years, originally in the shape of hearts owing to the use of antler picks.

==Hallstatt salt mine==
The Hallstatt salt mine is the world&#x27;s oldest working salt mine. The mine is located within the Upper Permian to Lower Triassic Haselgebirge Formation of the Northern Limestone Alps. The Hallstatt salt mine comprises 21 levels and several smaller shafts ranging from above sea level (Erbstollen level) to an elevation of around (Erzherzog Matthias Schurf level).

==Tourism==
Halstatt&#x27;s tourism began in the 19th century but greatly increased after it was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997. It became popular among East Asian tourists in 2006 when it was featured on a South Korean television show. 

Social media images of Hallstatt, captioned &quot;the most Instagrammable town in the world,&quot; went viral in Eastern and Southeastern Asia. In 2013, it was rumored in China to be the model for the movie &quot;Frozen&quot;″s Arendelle village. Filmmakers have said the village was based on research done in Norway and Canada, not in Austria, but the rumors increased daytourist visits.

=== Notable places ===
Hallstatt has several tourist sites. These include: 

Hallstatt Skywalk: Hallstatt Skywalk, also known as the &quot;World Heritage View&quot;, offers a panorama of the UNESCO World Heritage Site. Located 360 meters above Hallstatt, the platform overlooks the village, Lake Hallstatt and the surrounding Dachstein Alps. 

Hallstatt Ossuary (Beinhaus): Located in St. Michael&#x27;s Chapel, the Ossuary is a cultural monument comprising more than 1,200 human skulls, 600 of which are artistically painted with symbols, names and dates. The tradition of painting skulls and preserving bones began due to limited burial space in the village.

Hallstatt Museum and Excavations: The Hallstatt Museum covers the ancient history of the region, especially its role in the salt trade. It features artifacts from the Hallstatt culture, dating back to the Bronze and Iron Ages, including tools, weapons and burial objects. The museum also covers the archaeological excavations in the nearby area that reveal the complex society of the Hallstatt civilization.

=== Overtourism by day visitors ===

The problems and opportunities of greatly-increased tourism in Hallstatt were covered by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in August 2019. 

By 2017, local churches were employing bouncers to prevent services being disrupted by tourists. In 2020, the town had a population of 780, and estimates of 10,000 to nearly 30,000 tourists per day, primarily via bus tours which bring tourists briefly into the town for photo opportunities, then quickly move on. 

Tourism is important to Hallstatt&#x27;s economy, but according to locals the day-visitors drive away tourists who would stay longer. Hallstatt became the prime example of overtourism in Austria and led to controversies around limiting the number of tourists. The Austrian Public Broadcasting Organization made multiple documentaries about the situation. 

In 2020, the town focused on &quot;quality&quot; tourism. Starting in autumn 2020 there were assigned time slots for tour buses to cope with the problem. Arrivals were limited to 54 per day, about half of the previous number allowed. Buses with an overnight booking in the town received preference.

In 2023 locals protested against overtourism. In May, two fences were built to prevent tourists from stopping to take selfies; they were removed after &quot;a backlash&quot; on social media. In August, protesters blocked the entrance to a tunnel through which buses pass to enter the town. The mayor announced plans to reduce the number of buses allowed by another one-third.

==Politics==
Seats in the municipal assembly (&quot;Gemeinderat&quot;) as of 2021 local elections:

* Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ): 7
* BFH (Independent): 4
* Austrian People&#x27;s Party (ÖVP): 2

Alexander Scheutz (SPÖ) has been mayor of Hallstatt since 2009.

==International relations==
===Twin town===
Hallstatt is twinned with:

* Huizhou, China

===Replica===
On 16 June 2011, plans to build a replica in China were first reported. On 2 June 2012, it was reported that Chinese mining company China Minmetals Corporation built a full-scale replica of the entire town in Huizhou, Guangdong province. 

In 2022, the Chinese town of Hallstatt was the final location of the 12th episode of 1st Korean television series Money Heist: Korea – Joint Economic Area. In the episode it was named as Kherson in Ukraine.

==Climate==
Hallstatt, like much of Austria (see Climate of Austria), has a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;) (&quot;Cfb&quot; if the isotherm is used) with warm, rainy summers and chilly to cold, snowy winters. Precipitation is plentiful year-round, hence the &quot;f&quot; in &quot;Dfb,&quot; but is at its highest during the three months of summer: Jun-Aug.

Spring is a short (March and April) transition season between cold winters and mild summers. By mid-November, fall has turned to winter and the nighttime low temperature is ~freezing, giving a growing season of April to early November.

<doc id="426414" wikidata="Q333764" url="?curid=426414" title="Robert Kilroy-Silk">
<text>Robert Michael Kilroy-Silk (born Robert Michael Silk; 19 May 1942) is an English former politician and broadcaster. After a decade as a university lecturer, he served as a Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP) from 1974 to 1986. He left the House of Commons in 1986 in order to present a new BBC Television daytime talk show, &quot;Kilroy&quot;, which ran until 2004. He returned to politics, serving as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 2004 to 2009. He had a profound role in the mainstreaming of Eurosceptic politics in the UK and has been dubbed &#x27;The Godfather of Brexit&#x27;.

==Early life==
Kilroy-Silk was born in Birmingham, son of William Silk, a Royal Navy leading stoker, and his wife Minnie Rose (&quot;née&quot; Rooke). William Silk was lost at sea when aged 22, serving on , which was torpedoed and sunk off the coast of Brittany by German torpedo boats on 23 October 1943. His son was 17 months old.

Robert&#x27;s mother Rose remarried in 1946, to family friend John Francis Kilroy, a car worker at the Rootes plant in Warwickshire. He adopted the young boy, who from then used the surname Kilroy-Silk.

Kilroy-Silk failed his eleven-plus examination, for entry to selective schools, in 1953. He spent his first year at a secondary modern school and later passed the review exam and went to Saltley Grammar School, Saltley, Birmingham. He attended the London School of Economics to study politics and economics.

==Marriage and early career==
In 1963, Kilroy-Silk married Jan Beech, daughter of a shop steward. They have a son and a daughter.

After graduation he became a lecturer in politics at the University of Liverpool, serving from 1966 to 1974. He published a theoretical work, &quot;Socialism since Marx&quot;, in 1972. Kilroy-Silk moved to Warleigh House in Plymouth in 2015 with his wife.

==Political career==
===Labour MP===
At the February 1974 general election, Kilroy-Silk was elected as a Labour MP for the Ormskirk constituency in Lancashire. He remained its MP until its abolition at the 1983 general election, when he was elected to represent the new Knowsley North seat; he held this until his resignation from the House of Commons in 1986. In an article for &quot;The Times&quot; in 1975, Kilroy-Silk argued that politics was not &quot;compromises and bargains&quot; or hankering after &quot;a spurious consensus&quot;. He wrote that the function of government, particularly a Labour government, was 
&quot;to impose its values on society. Its role is creative: to cast, so far as it is able, society in its image&quot;. Furthermore, socialists should not be worried about being accused of dictatorial powers; they must go forward with &quot;a tint of arrogance&quot;.The next year he was quoted as saying, &quot;the Labour Party must always be a class party, for it is a class war we are fighting&quot;.

Kilroy-Silk was appointed Shadow Home Affairs spokesman, resigning in 1985. In resigning his seat, he said that he had been assaulted by members of the Militant group and was reported to have had a scuffle with left-wing Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn. He wrote a book about his experiences, entitled &quot;Hard Labour&quot;, and subsequently left the Labour Party.

===Eurosceptic politics===

====Joining UKIP====
In 2004, Kilroy-Silk was recruited to the UK Independence Party (UKIP). During that year&#x27;s European Parliament election campaign he presented one of the party political broadcasts. His recruitment and celebrity significantly raised the profile of the party, further helped by his enlisting of actress Joan Collins who attended a UKIP press conference at Kilroy-Silk&#x27;s invitation.

====Election to the European Parliament====
Kilroy-Silk stood on the UKIP list for the East Midlands constituency and was elected as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) in the second seat for his region.The election used a closed list form of proportional representation; UKIP scored 26.05 per cent of the vote in that region, just behind the Conservatives with 26.39 per cent.

====UKIP leadership====
In the 2004 Hartlepool by-election, UKIP came third, ahead of the Conservative Party. The next day, in an interview on &quot;Breakfast with Frost&quot; (BBC), Kilroy-Silk expressed ambition to lead UKIP and criticised the party&#x27;s leader Roger Knapman.

Following this, businessman and friend Paul Sykes announced his intention to cease his partial funding of UKIP and to return his support to the Conservatives, as he feared that the Eurosceptic vote might be split. The branch chairmen of UKIP were canvassed on their opinion regarding Kilroy-Silk&#x27;s challenge for the party leadership. Only a minority (13%) were sympathetic to him; Kilroy-Silk did not think this was significant, as he believed that too few party members had been consulted. Party officials threatened him with disciplinary action if he continued his challenge.

On 27 October 2004, Kilroy-Silk officially announced that he had withdrawn from the UKIP whip in the European Parliament, branding the party &quot;incompetent&quot;. But, he said that he would remain as an independent member of UKIP, and would continue to challenge for the leadership.

UKIP&#x27;s constitution states that 70 days&#x27; notice is required before a leadership ballot can take place. With the next general election in the UK expected in spring 2005, Kilroy-Silk pushed for an emergency general meeting of the party as early as possible. On 3 November 2004, Kilroy-Silk said he intended to be leader by Christmas, though this would have been impossible under the rules.

In Manchester on 3 December 2004 at about 7.15 p.m., Kilroy-Silk was attacked outside the Girls&#x27; High School, when a bucket of manure was thrown over him as he arrived for a recording of the BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Any Questions&quot;.

On 20 January 2005, Kilroy-Silk announced that he had left UKIP; he had been a member for nine months.

====Veritas====
On 30 January 2005 Kilroy-Silk launched a new political party Veritas, promising to take the fight to the &quot;supercilious metropolitan elite&quot;. Damian Hockney, UKIP&#x27;s leader in the London Assembly, had defected to Veritas, becoming its first Deputy Leader.

UKIP members and some journalists dubbed Kilroy-Silk&#x27;s new party &quot;Vanitas&quot;, meaning a party acting as a vehicle for its founder&#x27;s vanity.

The party was formally launched on 2 February 2005 at Hinckley Golf Club in Hinckley, Leicestershire. In the 2005 general election, Kilroy-Silk contested the seat of Erewash, but came in fourth with 5.8%, just above the 5% level needed to save his deposit. He tried to press charges against a man who, he said, &quot;smashed a bottle of water against the side of his head&quot; while the politician was being interviewed by a European television crew outside a supermarket. The alleged assailant said he had squirted Kilroy-Silk with water from a plastic bottle before running away; this account was confirmed by the TV crew, which also filmed the incident. The police decided not to prosecute.

On 12 July 2005, party member Ken Wharton announced his intention to challenge Kilroy-Silk for the leadership, claiming party members were &quot;not being looked after&quot;. Discontented party members set up the Veritas Members&#x27; Association to &quot;put the truth back into Veritas&quot;.

On 29 July 2005, Veritas announced the resignation of Kilroy-Silk as party leader. In his resignation statement, he said: 
&quot;It was clear from the general election result – and more recently that of the Cheadle by-election – that the electors are content with the old parties and that it would be virtually impossible for a new party to make a significant impact given the nature of our electoral system. We tried and failed.&quot;

In August 2005, four of the MEPs for the East Midlands region (Clark, Heaton-Harris, Helmer and Whitehead) sent a joint letter to President of the European Parliament Josep Borrell complaining about Kilroy-Silk: 
&quot;He seems to have done little or no work as a constituency MEP for the East Midlands. This leaves five MEPs to do the work of six and the electorate have been short-changed&quot;. They went on to complain that Kilroy-Silk was not &quot;fulfilling the pledge he made on becoming an MEP, to serve the electorate of his region&quot; and to call for him to &quot;either do the job for which he is paid, or get out and leave it to those who can.&quot;The European Parliament does not have any power to expel a member, and Borrell took no action.

====Political affiliation while an MEP====
Kilroy-Silk, who was elected to the European Parliament on the UKIP list, remained a member of the Veritas Party, but sat as an Independent MEP. Some Veritas members were reported to have questioned why he was allowed to continue as a party member.

Kilroy-Silk&#x27;s name was absent from the list of candidates published on 7 May 2009 for the 2009 European Parliament election. His membership was terminated when the European Parliament reconvened on 17 July 2009.

== Journalism ==
===Ireland===
In 1992, Kilroy made a comment regarding Ireland in his &quot;Daily Express&quot; column, under the guise of attacking Ray MacSharry, a former Irish government minister and EU commissioner, whom he described as &quot;a redundant second-rate politician from a country peopled by priests, peasants and pixies&quot;. This was condemned by the then Irish ambassador to the UK, Joseph Small, for its &quot;gratuitously offensive and indeed racist remarks&quot;. The newspaper&#x27;s editor, Sir Nicholas Lloyd, apologised to MacSharry and the Irish people in general, while Kilroy added: &quot;I accept that my references to Mr MacSharry and the Irish people were both offensive and unjustified, and I fully associate myself with this apology.&quot;

===Arabs===
The BBC cancelled the &quot;Kilroy&quot; show in January 2004 after an opinion article, entitled &quot;We owe Arabs nothing&quot;, by Kilroy-Silk was published in the &quot;Sunday Express&quot; on 4 January 2004. The article had first been published in April 2003 by the same paper and &#x27;republished in error&#x27; according to Kilroy-Silk. It did not attract much national attention when first published. According to Faisal Bodi, a columnist for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the reaction at its second publication was a measure of &quot;the increasing organisation of the Muslim community&quot;. Bodi added:


The article was strongly criticised by the Commission for Racial Equality, whose head, Trevor Phillips, said that the affair could have a &quot;hugely unhelpful&quot; effect. Bodi wrote that Kilroy-Silk should be prosecuted for incitement to racial hatred. He said that Kilroy-Silk had also written statements critical of Muslims in 1989, during the Salman Rushdie affair, and in a 1995 article in the &quot;Daily Express&quot;.

By contrast, Ibrahim Nawar, the head of Arab Press Freedom Watch, came out in support of Kilroy-Silk in a &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; article. He said the politician was &quot;an advocate of freedom of expression&quot; and that he agreed with much of what Kilroy-Silk had said about Arab regimes.

A spokeswoman for Kilroy-Silk told &quot;The Observer&quot;, &quot;He is not a racist at all – he employs a black driver&quot;, a quote which is sometimes incorrectly attributed to Kilroy-Silk.

==Media==
===&quot;Kilroy&quot;===
His talk show &quot;Kilroy&quot; started on 24 November 1986. Originally called &quot;Day to Day&quot;, the programme was renamed to &quot;Kilroy&quot; in September 1987. It ran until 2004 when it was cancelled by the BBC in reaction to the publication of an article by Kilroy-Silk entitled &quot;We owe Arabs nothing&quot; which was published in the &quot;Sunday Express&quot; on 4 January 2004. This provoked considerable controversy.

===&quot;Shafted&quot;===
In 2001, Kilroy-Silk hosted a television programme on ITV1 called &quot;Shafted&quot;. It was a quiz-show and at the end of the show, Kilroy-Silk would ask players whether they wished to &quot;share&quot; or to &quot;shaft&quot;, with accompanying hand gestures.

The show was cancelled after four episodes, with sixteen recordings unaired, due to falling ratings. The &quot;Penguin TV Companion&quot; (2006) ranked it as the worst British television show of the 2000s.

===&quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;===
Kilroy-Silk appeared as a guest on &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; on 30 April 2004. There was a heated exchange between him and his teammate Paul Merton, in which Merton repeatedly implored Kilroy-Silk to &quot;shut the fuck up&quot;. This was edited out of the televised episode but a clip from the recording appeared on social media some years later.

===Other television appearances===
On 31 January 2005, a television programme, &quot;Kilroy: Behind the Tan&quot;, was broadcast on the BBC. Created in documentary style, it followed the politician from his election as an MEP for UKIP to his leaving the party.

In early February 2005, Kilroy-Silk worked on a Channel 4 television programme called &quot;Kilroy and the Gypsies&quot;. He spent a week living with a family of Romany Gypsies at a campsite in Bedfordshire to explore their lives. He also interviewed residents of surrounding villages.

In other appearances, he was the first contestant to be voted out of the 2008 edition of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;. On 7 November 2009, he appeared as a panellist on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Question Time&quot; programme.

In November 2008 Derek Clark MEP complained that Kilroy-Silk was taking his parliamentary wage while being paid to appear in the reality TV show &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!&quot;. In his opinion the TV show represented a conflict of interest.

<doc id="426417" wikidata="Q606681" url="?curid=426417" title="Sphaerius">
<text>Sphaerius is a genus of beetles in the family Sphaeriusidae, comprising 18 species. It is one of the two extant genera in the family, the other being &quot;Bezesporum&quot;. They are typically found along the edges of streams and rivers, where they feed on algae; they occur on all continents except Antarctica. Three species occur in the United States.

The overall form of the beetle is convex, glossy, dark brown or black with some markings possible. The head is prominent, with relatively large eyes set far apart, and capitate antennae. Total length ranges from .

The beetles occur in a variety of damp environments, including mud, under stones, among plant roots and leaf litter, and in mosses in bogs. They store some air underneath their elytra.

Females produce a single large egg at a time.

The family used to be known as &quot;Sphaeriidae&quot;, but the name was preoccupied by a family of freshwater clams. The name was inappropriately replaced with &quot;Microsporidae&quot; (by changing the genus name to &quot;Microsporus&quot;), but this act has been superseded by a return to the use of &quot;Sphaerius&quot; and a reformation of the family name as Sphaeriusidae. The position of the family within Coleoptera has also changed a number of times.

==Species==
The genus includes the following 18 species, as of 2022:
*&quot;Sphaerius acaroides&quot; – Europe

<text>dbx, Inc. is an American manufacturer of professional audio recording equipment owned by Harman International, a subsidiary of South Korea-based company Samsung Electronics. It was founded by David E. Blackmer in 1971.

The original company goal was: &quot;To get closer to the realism of a live performance.&quot; Its early products were based on the concept of using decibel expansion which gave the company its name.

dbx is best known for the dbx noise reduction system, a decibel companding system used for noise reduction in professional analog tape recording that was in competition with Dolby NR in the early 1970s; though their systems did not gain as much traction. dbx is also the manufacturer of the Model 700, a unique but short-lived studio recording system, briefly popular in some circles as a mastering format.  Another early product was the eXpanded range DeciBel meter, a little solid-state meter that measured audio voltages both weaker and stronger than other bigger contemporary volume meters, built into an aluminum extrusion that was about the size of the meter itself, which was an earlier source of the company initials.  That dBx meter was related to their earlier CBS 600 extended range volume meter, developed and built at CBS Laboratories.

== Voltage controlled amplifier ==
The most important inventions of David Blackmer and dbx are the Blackmer gain cell (a voltage controlled amplifier for professional audio) and the dbx RMS detector.  The original dbx 202 VCA was based on the Blackmer gain cell and was referred to as the dbx 202 &quot;Black Can&quot; VCA.  They were built using discrete transistors that were hand matched while running at an elevated temperature in an oven. While noisy and having significant distortion, they exceeded by far the performance of other VCAs of the time. These VCAs were used in most early automated mixing boards.

== dbx compressors ==

In 1976 dbx introduced the dbx 160 compressor.  Using dbx&#x27;s decilinear VCA and RMS level-detection circuits and feed forward gain reduction this compressor allowed much smoother gain reduction. The feed forward gain reduction allowed infinite compression without excessive distortion or oscillation.  It also allowed the compressor to track the attack and release times of compression based on the signal&#x27;s envelope. The dbx 160 compressor also introduced OverEasy compression in which soft-knee gain reduction kicks in upon approaching a preset threshold.
A pro noise reduction card was the dbx k9, designed to fit into the pro dolby-A A361 frames, which were already in wide use in pro studios of the time, to reduce noise in reel-to-reel tape recordings.  One feature of the dbx system was an inbuilt noise-gate, to just shut off anything below a certain decibel level.

== Acquisition history of dbx ==

dbx manufactured only signal processing equipment until bought by BSR in 1979. From 1979 until 1989, the brand name was also used for consumer audio equipment such as speakers, CD players and amplifiers. In 1989, the short-lived Carillon Corporation bought dbx. Sanju Chiba of ELPJ acquired the dbx division of BSR and after virtually shutting down, the professional products division of dbx was sold off as a separate business to Orban AKG which in turn was bought by Harman International. The OEM business was sold to THAT Corporation founded by members of dbx&#x27;s engineering group. dbx once held key patents for MTS, the U.S. standard for stereo analog television transmission, but in 1994 it sold those patents to THAT Corporation.

In the present, they sell professional digital signal processors, equalizers, compressors, crossovers, subharmonic synthesizers, and many similar products.

<text>David E. Blackmer (January 11, 1927 – March 21, 2002) was an American audio electronics engineer, most famous as the inventor of the DBX noise reduction system and founder of dbx.

As well as audio noise reduction, Blackmer worked on extending the frequency response of audio electronics beyond the conventionally accepted audible range of 20 kHz. He also published research on the value of ultrasonic frequencies in sound reproduction, claiming that the time resolution of human hearing is 5 microseconds or better—which would correspond to a frequency of 200 kHz, requiring audio equipment ideally to have a flat response to that frequency.

Blackmer attended High Mowing School in Wilton, New Hampshire. He started in audio at Lafayette Radio in Boston in the 1940s and studied electronics in the U.S. Navy and at Harvard University and MIT. He later worked at Trans-Radio Recording Studio, Epsco, Hi-Con Eastern and Raytheon, where he designed telemetry systems for the Mercury space program. He founded dbx in 1971, selling it to BSR in 1979 and staying on with the company for several years. In the late 1980s he formed Earthworks, producing studio microphones, preamplifiers and studio reference monitors. He also founded Kintek (now Colortek) and Instrumentation Laboratory, as well as running the Cafe Pierrot restaurant in Wilton for a time.

Blackmer was a life member of the IEEE and a fellow of the Audio Engineering Society from 1976. He was also a great reader of science fiction. He had ten children.

<doc id="426423" wikidata="Q1408764" url="?curid=426423" title="Circassia">
<text>Circassia ( ), also known as Zichia, was a country and a historical region in . It spanned the western coastal portions of the North Caucasus, along the northeastern shore of the Black Sea. Circassia was conquered by the Russian Empire during the Russo-Circassian War (1763–1864), after which approximately 99.5–99.8% of the Circassian people were either exiled or massacred in the Circassian genocide.

In the medieval era, Circassia was nominally ruled by an elected Grand Prince, but individual principalities and tribes were autonomous. In the 18th–19th centuries, a central government began to form. The Circassians also dominated the northern end of the Kuban River, but were eventually pushed back to the south of the Kuban after suffering losses to military raids conducted by the Mongol Empire, the Golden Horde, and the Crimean Khanate. Their reduced borders then stretched from the Taman Peninsula to North Ossetia. Circassian lords subjugated and vassalized the neighbouring Karachays and Balkars and the Ossetians. The term Circassia is also used as the collective name of various Circassian states that were established within historical Circassian territory, such as Zichia.

Legally and internationally, the Treaty of Belgrade, which was signed between Austria and the Ottoman Empire in 1739, provided for the recognition of the independence of Eastern Circassia. Both the Russian Empire and the Ottoman Empire recognized it under witness from the other great powers of the time. The Congress of Vienna also stipulated the recognition of the independence of Circassia. In 1837, Circassian leaders sent letters to a number of European states requesting diplomatic recognition. Following this, the United Kingdom recognized Circassia. However, following the outbreak of the Russo-Circassian War, the Russian Empire did not recognize Circassia as an independent nation and instead treated it as Russian land under rebel occupation, despite having no control or ownership over the region. Russian generals often referred to the Circassians as &quot;mountaineers&quot;, &quot;bandits&quot;, and &quot;mountain scum&quot; rather than by their ethnonym.

The Russian conquest of Circassia created the Circassian diaspora; the overwhelming majority of Circassians today live outside of their ancestral homeland, mostly in Turkey and other parts of the Middle East. Only about 14% of the global Circassian population lives in the modern-day Russian Federation.

== Etymology ==
The words &quot;Circassia&quot; and &quot;Circassian&quot; ( ) are exonyms, Latinized from the word &quot;Cherkess&quot;, which is of debated origin. One view is that its root stems from Turkic languages, and that the term means &quot;head choppers&quot; or &quot;warrior killers&quot; accounting for the successful battle practices of the Circassians. There are those who argue that the term comes from Mongolian &quot;Jerkes&quot;, meaning &quot;one who blocks a path&quot;. Some believe it comes from the ancient Greek name of the region, &quot;Siraces&quot;. According to another view, its origin is Persian.

In languages spoken geographically close to the Caucasus, the native people originally had other names for the Circassia, but with Russian influence, the name has been settled as &quot;Cherkessia/Circassia&quot;. It is the same or similar in many world languages that cite these languages.

Circassians themselves don&#x27;t use the term &quot;Circassia&quot;, and refer to their country as Адыгэ Хэку (Adıgə Xəku) or Адыгей (Adıgey).

Another historical name for the country was Zichia (&quot;Zyx&quot; or the &quot;Zygii)&quot;, who were described by the ancient Greek intellectual Strabo as a nation to the north of Colchis.

== Geography ==

Circassia was located north of Western Asia, near the northeastern Black Sea coast. Before the Russian conquest of the Caucasus (1763–1864), it covered the entire fertile plateau and the steppe of the northwestern region of the Caucasus, with an estimated population of 1 million.

Circassia&#x27;s historical great range extended from the Taman Peninsula in the west, to the town of Mozdok in today&#x27;s North Ossetia–Alania in the east. Historically, Circassia covered the southern half of today&#x27;s Krasnodar Krai, the Republic of Adygea, Karachay-Cherkessia, Kabardino-Balkaria, and parts of North Ossetia–Alania and Stavropol Krai, bounded by the Kuban River on the north which separated it from the Russian Empire.

On the Black Sea coast, the climate is warm and humid, while being moderate in the lowlands and cooler in the highlands. Most of Circassia is frost free for more than half the year. There are steppe meadows in the plains, beech and oak forests in the foothills, and pine forests and alpine meadows in the mountains.

Sochi is considered by many Circassians as their traditional capital city. According to Circassians, the 2014 Winter Olympic village is built in an area of mass graves of Circassians after their defeat by the Russians Empire in 1864.

== Statehood and politics ==

=== Institute of the Grand Prince of Circassia ===
Between 1427 and 1453, Inal the Great conquered all Circassian principalities and declared himself the Grand Prince of Circassia. Following his death, Circassia was divided again.

The influential principalities of Circassia regularly met to elect a Grand Prince (Пщышхо) among them, with the only condition being that the prince can trace descent from Inal the Great. The existence of such an institute is confirmed by foreign sources. In the eyes of foreign observers, the Grand Prince was considered the king of the Circassians. However, the individual tribes were greatly autonomous and the title was mostly symbolic. In 1237, the Dominican monks Richard and Julian, as part of the Hungarian embassy, visited Circassia and the main city of this country Matrega, located on the Taman Peninsula. In Matrega, the embassy received a good reception from the Grand Prince.

In the 14th and 15th centuries Italian documents concerning the relationship between the consul of Kafa and Circassia clearly indicate the absolutely special status of the ruler of Circassia. This status allowed the senior prince of Circassia to correspond with the Pope. The letter of Pope John XXII, addressed to the Grand Prince of Zichia (Circassia) Verzacht, dates back to 1333, in which the Roman pontiff thanked the ruler for his diligence in introducing the Catholic faith among his subjects. Verzacht&#x27;s power status was so high that following his example some other Circassian princes adopted Catholicism.

=== Confederation ===
Circassia traditionally consisted of more than a dozen principalities. Some of these principalities were divided into large feudal estates, characterized by the stability of political status. Within these territories there were numerous feudal possessions of princes (pshi). The Circassian state was a federal state consisting of four levels of government: Village council (чылэ хасэ, made up of village elders and nobles), district council (made up of representatives from 7 neighboring village councils), regional council (шъолъыр хасэ, made up from neighboring district councils), people&#x27;s council (лъэпкъ зэфэс, where every council had a representative). A central government emerged during the mid to late 1800s. Prior to that, the institute of grand prince was mostly symbolic.

In 1807, Shuwpagwe Qalawebateqo self-proclaimed himself as the leader of the Circassian confederation, and divided Circassia into 12 major regions. In 1827, Ismail Berzeg officially declared the military confederation of the Circassian tribes and by 1839 united a significant part of Circassia under his control. In 1839, the Circassians declared Bighuqal (Anapa) as their new capital and Hawduqo Mansur was declared the new leader of the Circassian Confederation. He kept this title until his death. In 1848, Muhammad Amin was the leader of Circassia. After learning that a warriorly scholar has arrived, thousands of families moved to the Abdzakh region to accept his rule. Seferbiy Zaneqo assumed power after Amin&#x27;s departure, but died the next year.

In June 1860, at a congress of representatives of Circassians, a parliament was formed as the highest legislative body of Circassia. Being a political resistance council and the legislature of Circassia, the parliament was established in the capital of Sochi () on June 13, 1860 and Qerandiqo Berzeg was elected as the head of the parliament and the nation.

=== External relations ===
Legally and internationally, the Treaty of Belgrade 1739 provided for the recognition of the independence of Eastern Circassia (Kabarda), where both the Russian Empire and the Ottoman Empire recognized it, and the great powers at the time witnessed the treaty. The Congress of Vienna held in the period between 1814 and 1815 also stipulated the recognition of the independence of Circassia. In 1837, Circassian leaders sent letters to European countries requesting legal recognition. Following this, the United Kingdom recognized Circassia. However, during the Russian-Circassian War, the Russian Empire did not recognize Circassia as an independent region, and treated it as Russian land under rebel occupation, despite having no control or ownership over the region. Russian generals referred to the Circassians not by their ethnic name, but as &quot;mountaineers&quot;, &quot;bandits&quot;, and &quot;mountain scum&quot;.

The Circassian Parliament launched large-scale foreign policy activities. First of all, an official memorandum was drafted addressed to Tsar Alexander II. The text of the memorandum was presented to the tsar by the leaders of the Parliament during the latter&#x27;s visit to Circassia in September 1861. The Parliament also accepted an appeal to the Ottoman and European governments. Special envoys were sent to Istanbul and London to seek diplomatic and military support. The activities of the Circassian government received the full support of public organizations, so the Circassian Committee of Istanbul and London supported Circassia. Thus, if not de jure, then de facto Circassia acquired the features of a subject of international law.

==== Relations with the Ottoman Empire ====
In the 16th century, the English traveler Edmund Spencer, who traveled to the shores of the Caucasus, quotes a Circassian saying about the Ottoman sultan:Circassian blood flows in the veins of the Sultan. His mother, his harem are Circassian; his slaves are Circassians, his ministers and generals are Circassians. He is the head of our faith and also of our race.

== Army ==
Circassia for centuries lived under the threat of external invasions, so the whole way of life of the Circassians was militarized. The governor of Astrakhan wrote to Peter I:

Circassia developed the so-called &quot;Culture of War&quot;. Honorable combat was a big part of this culture, during hostilities, it was considered strictly unacceptable to set fire to homes or crops, especially bread, even from enemies. It was considered inadmissible to leave the bodies of dead comrades on the battlefield. It was considered a great disgrace in Circassia to fall alive into the hands of the enemy, so Russian officers who later fought in Circassia noted that it was very rare to succeed in capturing Circassians, as they would go as far as suicide. Johann von Blaramberg noted:

The Russian army, after invading Circassia and ethnically cleansing the Circassians in the Circassian genocide, adopted some parts of Circassian military uniforms - from weapons (Shashka and Circassian sabers, daggers, Circassian saddles, Circassian horses) to uniforms (Cherkeska, burqa, papaha).

==History==
=== Pseudoscientific origin ===
Turkish nationalist groups and proponents of modern day Pan-Turkism have claimed that the Circassians are of Turkic origin, but no scientific evidence has been published to support this claim and it has been strongly denied by ethnic Circassians, impartial research, linguists and historians around the world. The Circassian language does not share notable similarities to the Turkish language except for borrowed words. According to various historians, the Circassian origin of the Sindo-Meot tribes refutes the claim that the Circassians are of Turkic ethnic origin.

=== Ancient Era ===

==== Maikop Civilization ====
Miyequap (Maikop) civilization was established in 3000 BC. Circassians were known by many different names in ancient times. &quot;Kerket&quot; and &quot;Sucha&quot; are examples. In 1200 BC, Circassians fought alongside the Hittites against the Egyptians.

==== Sindica ====

The Sindica Kingdom was founded in 800 BC. During this period, Greeks (Greeks) and Sindi-Meotay tribes lived in Circassia. Under the roof of this state, Sindi-Meotians in the region became the ancestors of the Circassian people. The Greek poet Hipponax, who lived in the 5th century BC, and Herodotus later mentioned the Sindis. Strabo also mentions the Capitol of Sindia, located near the Black Sea coast. Information on Sindica has been learned from Greek documents and archaeological finds, and there is not much detail. It is not known exactly when the Sindica Kingdom was established, but it is known that the Sindis had a state and trade relations with the Greeks before the establishment of the Greek colonies on the Black Sea coast. It is also known that the kingdom of Sindica was a busy trading state where artists and merchants were accommodated. Circassians could not establish a union for a long time after this state.

=== Medieval Era ===
The most detailed description of medieval Circassia was made by Johannes de Galonifontibus in 1404. From his writing it follows that at the turn of the XIV and XV centuries, Circassia expanded its borders to the north to the mouth of the Don, and he notes that “the city and port of Tana is located in the same country in Upper Circassia, on the Don River, which separates Europe from Asia&quot;.  

Feudalism began to emerge in Circassians by the 4th century. As a result of Armenian, Greek and Byzantine influence, Christianity spread throughout the Caucasus between the 3rd and 5th centuries AD. During that period the Circassians (referred to at the time as &quot;Kassogs&quot;) began to accept Christianity as a national religion, but did not abandon all elements of their indigenous religious beliefs. Circassians established many states, but could not achieve political unity. From around 400 AD wave after wave of invaders began to invade the lands of the Adyghe people, who were also known as the &quot;Kasogi&quot; (or Kassogs) at the time. They were conquered first by the Bulgars (who originated on the Central Asian steppes). Outsiders sometimes confused the Adyghe people with the similarly named Utigurs (a branch of the Bulgars), and both peoples were sometimes conflated under misnomers such as &quot;Utige&quot;. Following the dissolution of the Khazar state, the Adyghe people were integrated around the end of the 1st millennium AD into the Kingdom of Alania. Between the 10th and 13th centuries Georgia had influence on the Adyghe Circassian peoples.

In 1382, Circassian mamluks took the Mamluk throne; the Burji dynasty took over and the Mamluks became ruled by Circassians. The Mongols, who started invading the Caucasus in 1223, destroyed some of the Circassians and most of the Alans. The Circassians, who lost most of their lands during the ensuing Golden Horde attacks, had to retreat to the back of the Kuban River. In 1395 Circassians fought violent wars against Tamerlane, Tamerlane plundered Circassia.

=== King Inal the Great ===
Inal is called the &quot;Prince of Princes&quot; by Circassians and Abkhazians, because he united all Circassian tribes and established the Circassian state. According to popular belief, Inal is the ancestor of Kabardian, Besleney, Chemguy and Hatuqwai princes.

Inal, who during the 1400s owned land in the Taman peninsula, established an army consisting mostly of the Khegayk tribe and declared that his goal was to unite the Circassians, which were divided into many states at that time, under a single state, and after declaring his own princedom, conquered all of Circassia one by one.

Circassian nobles and princes tried to prevent Inal&#x27;s rise, but in a battle near the Msimta River, 30 Circassian lords were defeated by Inal and his supporters. Ten of them were executed, while the remaining twenty lords took an oath of allegiance and joined the forces of Inal&#x27;s new state. Inal, who ruled Western Circassia, established the Kabarda region in Eastern Circassia in 1434 and drove the Crimean Tatar tribes in the Circassian lands to the north of the Kuban River in 1438, and as a result of his effective expansions, he was ruling all of the Circassian land.

The capital of this new Circassian state founded by Inal became the city of Shanjir, built in the Taman region where he was born and raised. Although the exact location of the city of Shanjir is unknown, the most supported theory is that it is the Krasnaya Batareya district, which fits the descriptions of the city made by Klarapoth and Pallas.

Although he united the Circassians, Inal still wanted to include the cousin people, the Abkhaz, in his state. Abkhaz dynasties Chachba and Achba announced that they would side with Inal in a possible war. Inal, who won the war in Abkhazia, officially conquered Northern Abkhazia and the Abkhaz people recognized the rule of Inal, and Inal finalized his rule in Abkhazia. One of the stars on the flag of Abkhazia represents Inal.

Inal divided his lands between his sons and grandchildren in 1453 and died in 1458. Following this, Circassian tribal principalities were established. Some of these are Chemguy founded by Temruk, Besleney founded by Beslan, Kabardia founded by Qabard, and Shapsug founded by Zanoko.

According to the Abkhaz claim, Inal died in North Abkhazia. Although most sources cite this theory, researches and searches in the region have shown that Inal&#x27;s tomb is not here. According to Russian explorer and archaeologist Evgeniy Dimitrievich Felitsin, Inal&#x27;s tomb is not in Abkhazia. In a map published in 1882, Felitsin has shown great importance to Inal, and placed his grave in the Ispravnaya region in Karachay-Cherkessia, not in Abkhazia. He added that there are ancient sculptures, mounds, tombs, churches, castles and ramparts in this area, which would be an ideal tomb for someone like Inal.

At the end of the 15th century, a detailed description of Circassia and of its inhabitants was made by Genovese traveller and ethnographer Giorgio Interiano.

=== Modern Era ===

==== Kanzhal ====

In 1708, Circassians paid a great tribute to the Ottoman sultan in order to prevent Tatar raids, but the sultan did not fulfill the obligation and the Tatars raided all the way to the center of Circassia, robbing everything they could. For this reason, Kabardian Circassians announced that they would never pay tribute to the Crimean Khan and the Ottoman Sultan again to Kabardia under the leadership of the Crimean khan Kaplan-Girey to conquer the Circassians and ordered him collect the tribute. The Ottomans expected an easy victory against the Kabardinians, but the Circassians won because of the strategy set up by the Kazaniko Jabagh.

The Crimean army was completely destroyed overnight. The Crimean Khan Kaplan-Giray barely managed to save his life, and was humiliated, all the way to his shoes taken, leaving his brother, son, field tools, tents and personal belongings.

==== Russo-Circassian War ====

In 1714, Peter I established a plan to occupy the Caucasus. Although he was unable to implement this plan, he laid the political and ideological foundation for the occupation to take place. Catherine II started putting this plan into action. The Russian army was deployed on the banks of the Terek River.

The Russian military tried to impose authority by building a series of forts, but these forts in turn became the new targets of raids and indeed sometimes the highlanders actually captured and held the forts. Under Yermolov, the Russian military began using a strategy of disproportionate retribution for the raids against their forts before. Russian troops retaliated by destroying villages where resistance fighters were thought to hide, as well as employing assassinations, kidnappings and the execution of whole families. Because the resistance was relying on sympathetic villages for food, the Russian military also systematically destroyed crops and livestock and killed Circassian civilians. Circassians responded by creating a tribal federation encompassing all tribes of the area. In 1840 Karl Friedrich Neumann estimated the Circassian casualties at around one and a half million. Some sources state that hundreds of thousands of others died during the exodus. Several historians use the phrase &quot;Circassian massacres&quot; for the consequences of Russian actions in the region.

In a series of sweeping military campaigns lasting from 1860 to 1864... the northwest Caucasus and the Black Sea coast were virtually emptied of Muslim villagers. Columns of the displaced were marched either to the Kuban [River] plains or toward the coast for transport to the Ottoman Empire... One after another, entire Circassian tribal groups were dispersed, resettled, or killed en masse.

Circassians established an assembly called &quot;Great Freedom Assembly&quot; in the capital city of Shashe (Sochi) on June 25, 1861. Haji Qerandiqo Berzedj was appointed as the head of the assembly. This assembly asked for help from Europe, arguing that they would be forced into exile soon. However, before the result was achieved, Russian General Kolyobakin invaded Sochi and destroyed the parliament and no country opposed this.

In May 1864, a final battle took place between the Circassian army of 20,000 Circassian horsemen and a fully equipped Russian army of 100,000 men. Circassian warriors attacked the Russian army and tried to break through the line, but most were shot down by Russian artillery and infantry. The remaining fighters continued to fight as militants and were soon defeated. All 20,000 Circassian horsemen died in the war. The Russian army began celebrating victory on the corpses of Circassian soldiers, and so May 21, 1864, was officially the end of the war.

==== Circassian Genocide ====

The proposal to deport the Circassians was ratified by the Russian government, and a flood of refugee movements began as Russian troops advanced in their final campaign. Circassians prepared to resist and hold their last stand against Russian military advances and troops. With the refusal to surrender, Circassian civilians were targeted one by one by the Russian military with thousands massacred and the Russians started to raid and burn Circassian villages, destroy the fields to make it impossible to return, cut trees down and drive the people towards the Black Sea coast.

Although the main target of the genocide was the Circassians, some Abkhaz, Abazin, Chechen, Ossetian and other Muslim Caucasian communities were also affected. Although it is not known exactly how many people are affected, researchers have suggested that at least 75%, 90%, 94%, or 95–97% (not including the other ethniticies such as Abkhaz) of the ethnic Circassian population are affected. Considering these rates, calculations including those taking into account the Russian government&#x27;s own archival figures, have estimated a loss 600,000–1,500,000. It is estimated that the population of Kabardins in Circassia was reduced from 500,000 to 35,000; the Abzakhs from 260,000 to 14,600; and the Natukhajs from 240,000 to merely 175 persons. The Shapsugh tribe which numbered some 300,000 were reduced to 3,000 people. Ivan Drozdov, a Russian officer who witnessed the scene at Qbaada in May 1864 as the other Russians were celebrating their victory remarked:

The Ottoman Empire regarded the Adyghe warriors as courageous and experienced. It encouraged them to settle in various near-border settlements of the Ottoman Empire in order to strengthen the empire&#x27;s borders.

According to Walter Richmond

Circassia was a small independent nation on the northeastern shore of the Black Sea. For no reason other than ethnic hatred, over the course of hundreds of raids the Russians drove the Circassians from their homeland and deported them to the Ottoman Empire. At least 600,000 people lost their lives to massacre, starvation, and the elements while hundreds of thousands more were forced to leave their homeland. By 1864, three-fourths of the population was annihilated, and the Circassians had become one of the first stateless peoples in modern history.

, Georgia was the only country to classify the events as genocide, while Russia actively denies the Circassian genocide, and classifies the events as a simple migration of &quot;undeveloped barbaric peoples&quot;. Russian nationalists continue to celebrate the day on May 21 each year as a &quot;holy conquest day&quot;, when the Russian Empire&#x27;s resistance to the occupation of the Caucasus ended. Circassians commemorate May 21 every year as the Circassian Day of Mourning.

==Population==
There are twelve historic Adyghe (Circassian: Адыгэ, &quot;Adyge&quot;) princedoms or tribes of Circassia (three democratic and nine aristocratic); Abdzakh, Besleney, Bzhedug, Hatuqwai, Kabardian, Mamkhegh, Natukhai, Shapsug, Temirgoy, Ubykh, Yegeruqwai and Zhaney.

Today, about 700,000 Circassians remain in historical Circassia in today&#x27;s Russia. The 2010 Russian Census recorded 718,727 Circassians, of which 516,826 are Kabardians, 124,835 are Adyghe proper, 73,184 are Cherkess and 3,882 Shapsugs. The largest Circassian population resides in Turkey (pop. 1,400,000–6,000,000). Circassian populations also exist in other countries, such as Jordan, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, Serbia, Egypt and Israel, but are considerably smaller.

== National religion ==
Circassia gradually went through the following various religions: Paganism, Christianity, and then Islam.

=== Paganism ===
The ancient beliefs of the Circassians were based on animism and magic, within the framework of the customary rules of Xabze. Although the main belief was Monistic-Monotheistic, they prayed using water, fire, plants, forests, rocks, thunder, and lightning. They performed their acts of worship accompanied by dance and music in the sacred groves used as temples. An old priest led the ceremony, accompanied by songs of prayer, and supplications. It was aimed at protecting newborn babies from diseases and the evil eye. Another important aspect was ancestors and honor. They believed that the goal of man&#x27;s earthly existence is the perfection of the soul, which corresponds to the maintenance of honour, manifestation of compassion, gratuitous help, which, along with valour, and bravery of a warrior, enables the human soul to join the soul of the ancestors with a clear conscience.

=== Judaism ===
Some Circassian tribes converted to Judaism in the past as a result of the settlement of approximately 20 thousand Jews in 8th-century Circassia, along with the relations established with the Turkic-Jewish Khazar Khaganate. Judaism in Circassia eventually assimilated into Christianity and Islam.

=== Christianity ===
It is the tradition of the early church that Christianity made its first appearance in Circassia in the 1st century AD via the travels and preaching of the Apostle Andrew, but recorded history suggests that, as a result of Greek and Byzantine influence, Christianity first spread throughout Circassia between the 3rd and 5th centuries AD. The spread of the Catholic faith was only possible with the Latin Conquest of Constantinople by the crusaders and the establishment of the Latin state. The Catholic religion was adopted by the Circassians following Farzakht, a distinguished figure who greatly contributed to the spread of this religion in his country. The pope sent him a letter in 1333 thanking him for his effort, as an indication of his gratitude. For Circassians, the most important and attractive personality in all Christian teachings was the personality of Saint George. They saw in him the embodiment of all the virtues respected in the Caucasus. His name in Circassian is &quot;Aushe-Gerge&quot;.

Christianity in Circassia experienced its final collapse in the 18th century when all Circassians accepted Islam. The ex-priests joined the Circassian nobility and were given the name &quot;shogene&quot; (teacher) and over time this name became a surname.

Today Christianity is still widespread among Mozdok Kabardians.

=== Islam ===
In 815 AD, Islam arrived in Circassia with the efforts of two Arab preachers called Abu Ishaq and Muhammad Kindi, and the first Circassian Muslim community was established with a small amount of followers. A small Muslim community in Circassia has existed since the Middle Ages, but the widespread adoption of Islam occurred after 1717. Travelling Sufi preachers and the increasing threat of an invasion from Russia helped expedite the spread of Islam in Circassia. Circassian scholars educated in the Ottoman Empire boosted the spread of Islam.

==Circassian nationalism==
Under Russian and Soviet rule, ethnic and tribal divisions between Circassians were promoted, resulting in several different statistical names being used for various parts of the Circassian people (Adyghes, Cherkess, Kabardins, Shapsugs). Consequently, Circassian nationalism has developed. Circassian nationalism is the desire among Circassians all over the world to preserve their culture and save their language from extinction, achieve full international recognition of the Circassian genocide, globally revive Adyghe Xabze among Circassians, return to their homeland Circassia, and ultimately reestablish an independent Circassian state. There is also an effort among Circassians to unite under the name &quot;Circassian&quot; (Adyghe) in Russian Censuses to reflect and revive the concept of the Circassian nation. The overwhelming majority of the diaspora already tends to call itself &quot;only Circassian&quot;.

<text>A rain shadow is an area of significantly reduced rainfall behind a mountainous region, on the side facing away from prevailing winds, known as its leeward side.

Evaporated moisture from water bodies (such as oceans and large lakes) is carried by the prevailing onshore breezes towards the drier and hotter inland areas. When encountering elevated landforms, the moist air is driven upslope towards the peak, where it expands, cools, and its moisture condenses and starts to precipitate. If the landforms are tall and wide enough, most of the humidity will be lost to precipitation over the windward side (also known as the &quot;rainward&quot; side) before ever making it past the top. As the air descends the leeward side of the landforms, it is compressed and heated, producing foehn winds that &quot;absorb&quot; moisture downslope and cast a broad &quot;shadow&quot; of dry climate region behind the mountain crests. This climate typically takes the form of shrub–steppe, xeric shrublands or even deserts.

The condition exists because warm moist air rises by orographic lifting to the top of a mountain range. As atmospheric pressure decreases with increasing altitude, the air has expanded and adiabatically cooled to the point that the air reaches its adiabatic dew point (which is not the same as its constant pressure dew point commonly reported in weather forecasts). At the adiabatic dew point, moisture condenses onto the mountain and it precipitates on the top and windward sides of the mountain. The air descends on the leeward side, but due to the precipitation it has lost much of its moisture. Typically, descending air also gets warmer because of adiabatic compression (as with foehn winds) down the leeward side of the mountain, which increases the amount of moisture that it can absorb and creates an arid region.

==Notably affected regions==
There are regular patterns of prevailing winds found in bands round Earth&#x27;s equatorial region. The zone designated the trade winds is the zone between about 30° N and 30° S, blowing predominantly from the northeast in the Northern Hemisphere and from the southeast in the Southern Hemisphere. The westerlies are the prevailing winds in the middle latitudes between 30 and 60 degrees latitude, blowing predominantly from the southwest in the Northern Hemisphere and from the northwest in the Southern Hemisphere. Some of the strongest westerly winds in the middle latitudes can come in the Roaring Forties of the Southern Hemisphere, between 30 and 50 degrees latitude.

Examples of notable rain shadowing include:

===Africa===
====Northern Africa====

* The Sahara is made even drier because of a strong rain shadow effects caused by major mountain ranges (whose highest points can culminate up to more than 4,000 meters; 2½ miles high). To the northwest, the Atlas Mountains, covering the Mediterranean coast for Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. On the windward side of the Atlas Mountains, the warm, moist winds blowing from the northwest off the Atlantic Ocean which contain a lot of water vapor, are forced to rise, lift up and expand over the mountain range. This causes them to cool down, which causes an excess of moisture to condense into high clouds and results in heavy precipitation over the mountain range. This is known as orographic rainfall and after this process, the air is dry because it has lost most of its moisture over the Atlas Mountains. On the leeward side, the cold, dry air starts to descend and to sink and compress, making the winds warm up. This warming causes the moisture to evaporate, making clouds disappear. This prevents rainfall formation and creates desert conditions in the Sahara. 
* Desert regions in the Horn of Africa (Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia and Djibouti) such as the Danakil Desert are all influenced by the air heating and drying produced by rain shadow effect of the Ethiopian Highlands. 

====Southern Africa====

* The windward side of the island of Madagascar, which sees easterly on-shore winds, is wet tropical, while the western and southern sides of the island lie in the rain shadow of the central highlands and are home to thorn forests and deserts. The same is true for the island of Réunion.
* On Tristan da Cunha, Sandy Point on the east coast is warmer and drier than the rainy, windswept settlement of Edinburgh of the Seven Seas in the west.
* In Western Cape Province, the Breede River Valley and the Karoo region lie in the rain shadow of the Cape Fold Mountains and are arid; whereas the wettest parts of the Cape Mountains can receive , Worcester receives only around and is useful only for grazing.

===Asia===
====Central and Northern Asia====
* The Himalaya and connecting ranges also contribute to arid conditions in Central Asia including Mongolia&#x27;s Gobi desert, as well as the semi-arid steppes of Mongolia and north-central to north western China.
* The Verkhoyansk Range in eastern Siberia is the coldest place in the Northern Hemisphere, because the moist southeasterly winds from the Pacific Ocean lose their moisture over the coastal mountains well before reaching the Lena River valley, due to the intense Siberian High forming around the very cold continental air during the winter. One effect in the Sakha Republic (Yakutia) is that, in Yakutsk, Verkhoyansk, and Oymyakon, the average temperature in the coldest month is below . These regions are synonymous with extreme cold.

====Eastern Asia====
* The Ordos Desert is rain shadowed by mountain chains including the Kara-naryn-ula, the Sheitenula, and the Yin Mountains, which link on to the south end of the Great Khingan Mountains.
* The central region of Myanmar is in the rain shadow of the Arakan Mountains and is almost semi-arid with only of rain, versus up to on the Rakhine State coast.
* The plains around Tokyo, Japan – known as Kanto plain – during winter experiences significantly less precipitation than the rest of the country by virtue of surrounding mountain ranges, including the Japanese Alps, blocking prevailing northwesterly winds originating in Siberia.

====Southern Asia====

* The eastern side of the Sahyadri ranges on the Deccan Plateau including: Vidarbha, North Karnataka, Rayalaseema and western Tamil Nadu.
* Gilgit and Chitral, Pakistan, are rainshadow areas.
* The Thar Desert is bounded and rain shadowed by the Aravalli ranges to the southeast, the Himalaya to the northeast, and the Kirthar and Sulaiman ranges to the west.
*The Central Highlands of Sri Lanka rain shadow the northeastern parts of the island, which experience much less severe summer monsoon rains and instead have precipitation peaks in autumn and winter.

====Western Asia====
* The peaks of the Caucasus Mountains to the west and Hindukush and Pamir to the east rain shadow the Karakum and Kyzyl Kum deserts east of the Caspian Sea, as well as the semi-arid Kazakh Steppe. They also cause vast rainfall differences between coastal areas on the Black Sea such as Rize, Batumi and Sochi contrasted with the dry lowlands of Azerbaijan facing the Caspian Sea.
* The semi-arid Anatolian Plateau is rain shadowed by mountain chains, including the Pontic Mountains in the north and the Taurus Mountains in the south.
* The High Peaks of Mount Lebanon rain-shadow the northern parts of the Beqaa Valley and Anti-Lebanon Mountains.
* The Judaean Desert, the Dead Sea and the western slopes of the Moab Mountains on the opposite (Jordanian) side are rain-shadowed by the Judaean Mountains.
* The Dasht-i-Lut in Iran is in the rain shadow of the Elburz and Zagros Mountains and is one of the most lifeless areas on Earth.
* The peaks of the Zagros Mountains rain-shadow the northern half of the West Azerbaijan province in Iranian Azerbaijan (above Urmia), as manifested by the province&#x27;s dry winters relative to those in the windward part of the region (i.e. Kurdistan Region and Hakkâri Province in Turkey).
*Much of the Mesaoria Plain of Cyprus is in the rain shadow of the Troodos Mountains and is semi-arid.

=== Europe ===
====Central Europe====
* The Plains of Limagne and Forez in the northern Massif Central, France are also relatively rainshadowed (mostly the plain of Limagne, shadowed by the Chaîne des Puys (up to 2000 mm; 80&quot; of rain a year on the summits and below 600mm; 20&quot; at Clermont-Ferrand, which is one of the driest places in the country).
* The Piedmont wine region of northern Italy is rainshadowed by the mountains that surround it on nearly every side: Asti receives only 527 mm (20¾&quot;) of precipitation per year, making it one of the driest places in mainland Italy.
* Some valleys in the inner Alps are also strongly rainshadowed by the high surrounding mountains: the areas of Gap and Briançon in France, the district of Zernez in Switzerland.
* The Kuyavia and the eastern part of the Greater Poland has an average rainfall of about 450 mm (18&quot;) because of rainshadowing by the slopes of the Kashubian Switzerland, making it one of the driest places in the North European Plain.

====Northern Europe====
* The Pennines of Northern England, the mountains of Wales, the Lake District and the Highlands of Scotland create a rain shadow that includes most of the eastern United Kingdom, due to the prevailing south-westerly winds. Manchester and Glasgow, for example, receive around double the rainfall of Leeds and Edinburgh respectively (although there are no mountains between Edinburgh and Glasgow). The contrast is even stronger further north, where Aberdeen gets around a third of the rainfall of Fort William or Skye. In Devon, rainfall at Princetown on Dartmoor is almost three times the amount received to the east at locations such as Exeter and Teignmouth. The Fens of East Anglia receive similar rainfall amounts to Seville.
* Iceland has plenty of microclimates courtesy of the mountainous terrain. Akureyri on a northerly fiord receives about a third of the precipitation that the island of Vestmannaeyjar off the south coast gets. The smaller island is in the pathway of Gulf Stream rain fronts with mountains lining the southern coast of the mainland.
* The Scandinavian Mountains create a rain shadow for lowland areas east of the mountain chain and prevents the Oceanic climate from penetrating further east; thus Bergen and a place like Brekke in Sogn, west of the mountains, receive an annual precipitation of and , respectively, while Oslo receives only , and Skjåk Municipality, a municipality situated in a deep valley, receives only . Further east, the partial influence of the Scandinavian Mountains contribute to areas in east-central Sweden around Stockholm only receiving annually. In the north, the mountain range extending to the coast in around Narvik and Tromsø cause a lot higher precipitation there than in coastal areas further east facing north such as Alta or inland areas like Kiruna across the Swedish border.
* The South Swedish highlands, although not rising more than , reduce precipitation and increase summer temperatures on the eastern side. Combined with the high pressure of the Baltic Sea, this leads to some of the driest climates in the humid zones of Northern Europe being found in the triangle between the coastal areas in the counties of Kalmar, Östergötland and Södermanland along with the offshore island of Gotland on the leeward side of the slopes. Coastal areas in this part of Sweden usually receive less precipitation than windward locations in Andalusia in the south of Spain.

====Southern Europe====

* The Cantabrian Mountains form a sharp division between &quot;Green Spain&quot; to the north and the dry central plateau. The northern-facing slopes receive heavy rainfall from the Bay of Biscay, but the southern slopes are in rain shadow. The other most evident effect on the Iberian Peninsula occurs in the Almería, Murcia and Alicante areas, each with an average rainfall of 300 mm (12&quot;), which are the driest spots in Europe (see Cabo de Gata) mostly a result of the mountain range running through their western side, which blocks the westerlies.
* The Norte Region in Portugal has extreme differences in precipitation with values surpassing in the Peneda-Gerês National Park to values close to in the Douro Valley. Despite being only apart, Chaves has less than half the precipitation of Montalegre.
* The eastern part of the Pyrenean mountains in the south of France (Cerdagne).
* In the Northern Apennines of Italy, Mediterranean city La Spezia receives twice the rainfall of Adriatic city Rimini on the eastern side. This is also extended to the southern end of the Apennines that see vast rainfall differences between Naples with above on the Mediterranean side and Bari with about on the Adriatic side.
* The valley of the Vardar River and south from Skopje to Athens is in the rain shadow of the Accursed Mountains and Pindus Mountains. On its windward side the Accursed Mountains has the highest rainfall in Europe at around with small glaciers even at mean annual temperatures well above , but the leeward side receives as little as .

===Caribbean===
* Throughout the Greater Antilles, the southwestern sides are in the rain shadow of the trade winds and can receive as little as per year as against over on the northeastern, windward sides and over over some highland areas. This is most apparent in Cuba, where this phenomenon leads to the Cuban cactus scrub ecoregion, and the island of Hispaniola (which contains the Caribbean&#x27;s highest mountain ranges), which results in xeric semi-arid shrublands throughout the Dominican Republic and Haiti.

===North American mainland===

On the largest scale, the entirety of the North American Interior Plains are shielded from the prevailing Westerlies carrying moist Pacific weather by the North American Cordillera. More pronounced effects are observed, however, in particular valley regions within the Cordillera, in the direct lee of specific mountain ranges. This includes much of the Basin and Range Province in the United States and Mexico.

The Pacific Coast Ranges create rain shadows near the West Coast:
* The Dungeness Valley around Sequim and Port Angeles, Washington lies in the rain shadow of the Olympic Mountains. The area averages of rain per year. The rain shadow extends to the eastern Olympic Peninsula, Whidbey Island, parts of the San Juan Islands, and Victoria, British Columbia which receive between of precipitation each year. Seattle is also affected by the rain shadow, albeit to a much lesser effect. By contrast, Aberdeen, which is situated southwest of the Olympics, receives nearly of rain per year
* The east slopes of the Coast Ranges in central and southern California cut off the southern San Joaquin Valley from enough precipitation to ensure desert-like conditions in areas around Bakersfield.
* San Jose, and adjacent cities are usually drier than the rest of the San Francisco Bay Area because of the rain shadow cast by the highest part of the Santa Cruz Mountains.
* The Sonoran Desert is bounded to the west by the Peninsular Ranges, but extends even along part of the east coast of the Gulf of California.
* The Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico are west of the Chihuahuan Desert.

Most rain shadows in the western United States are due to the Sierra Nevada mountains in California and Cascade Mountains, mostly in Oregon and Washington.
* The Cascades create a rain-shadowed Columbia Basin area of Eastern Washington and valleys in British Columbia, Canada - most notably the Thompson and Nicola Valleys which can receive less than of rain in parts, and the Okanagan Valley (particularly the south, nearest to the US border) which receives anywhere from 12–17 inches of rain annually.
* The endorheic Great Basin of Utah and Nevada is in the rain shadows of the Cascades and Sierra Nevada.
* The Mojave Desert is rain-shadowed by the Sierra Nevada and the Transverse Ranges of southern California.
* The Black Rock Desert is in the rain shadows of the Cascades and Sierra Nevada.
* California&#x27;s Owens Valley is rain-shadowed by the Sierra Nevada.
* Death Valley in the United States, behind both the Pacific Coast Ranges of California and the Sierra Nevada range, is the driest place in North America and one of the driest places on the planet. This is also due to its location well below sea level which tends to cause high pressure and dry conditions to dominate due to the greater weight of the atmosphere above.

The Colorado Front Range is limited to precipitation that crosses over the Continental Divide. While many locations west of the Divide may receive as much as of precipitation per year, some places on the eastern side, notably the cities of Denver and Pueblo, Colorado, typically receive only about 12 to 19 inches. Thus, the Continental Divide acts as a barrier for precipitation. This effect applies only to storms traveling west-to-east. When low pressure systems skirt the Rocky Mountains and approach from the south, they can generate high precipitation on the eastern side and little or none on the western slope.

Further east:
* The Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, wedged between the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians and the Blue Ridge Mountains and partially shielded from moisture from the west and southeast, is much drier than the very humid remainder of Virginia and the American Southeast.
* Asheville, North Carolina sits in the rain shadow of the Balsam, Smoky, and Blue Ridge Mountains. While the mountains surrounding Asheville contain the Appalachian Temperate Rainforests, with areas receiving over an annual average precipitation of , the city itself is the driest location in North Carolina, with an annual average precipitation of only .
* Ashcroft, British Columbia, the only true desert in Canada, sits in the rain shadow of the Coast Mountains of Canada.
* Yellowknife, the capital and most populous city in the Northwest Territories of Canada, is located in the rain shadow of the mountain ranges to the west of the city.

===Oceania===
====Australia====
* In New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, Monaro is shielded by both the Snowy Mountains to the northwest and coastal ranges to the southeast. Consequently, parts of it are as dry as the wheat-growing lands of those states. For comparison, Cooma receives of rain annually, whereas Batlow, on the western side of the ranges, receives of precipitation. Furthermore, Australia&#x27;s capital Canberra is also protected from the west by the Brindabellas which create a strong rain shadow in Canberra&#x27;s valleys, where it receives an annual rainfall of , compared to Adjungbilly&#x27;s . In the cool season, the Great Dividing Range also shields much of the southeast coast (i.e. Sydney, the Central Coast, the Hunter Valley, Illawarra, the South Coast) from south-westerly polar blasts that originate from the Southern Ocean.
* In Queensland, the land west of Atherton Tableland in the Tablelands Region lies on a rain shadow and therefore would feature significantly lower annual rainfall averages than those in the Cairns Region. For comparison, Tully, which is on the eastern side of the tablelands, towards the coast, receives annual rainfall that exceeds , whereas Mareeba, which lies on the rain shadow of the Atherton Tableland, receives of rainfall annually.
* In Tasmania, the central Midlands region is in a strong rain shadow and receives only about a fifth as much rainfall as the highlands to the west.
* In Victoria, the western side of Port Phillip Bay is in the rain shadow of the Otway Ranges. The area between Geelong and Werribee is the driest part of southern Victoria: the crest of the Otway Ranges receives of rain per year and has myrtle beech rainforests much further west than anywhere else, whilst the area around Little River receives as little as annually, which is as little as Nhill or Longreach and supports only grassland. Also in Victoria, Omeo is shielded by the surrounding Victorian Alps, where it receives around of annual rain, whereas other places nearby exceed .
* Western Australia&#x27;s Wheatbelt and Great Southern regions are shielded by the Darling Range to the west: Mandurah, near the coast, receives about annually. Dwellingup, 40 km (25 miles) inland and in the heart of the ranges, receives over a year while Narrogin, further east, receives less than a year.

====Pacific Islands====
* Hawaii also has rain shadows, with some areas being desert. Orographic lifting produces the world&#x27;s second-highest annual precipitation record, , on the island of Kauai; the leeward side is understandably rain-shadowed. The entire island of Kahoolawe lies in the rain shadow of Maui&#x27;s East Maui Volcano.
* New Caledonia lies astride the Tropic of Capricorn, between 19° and 23° south latitude. The climate of the islands is tropical, and rainfall is brought by trade winds from the east. The western side of the Grande Terre lies in the rain shadow of the central mountains, and rainfall averages are significantly lower.
* On the South Island of New Zealand is found one of the most remarkable rain shadows anywhere on Earth. The Southern Alps intercept moisture coming off the Tasman Sea, precipitating about 6,300 mm (250 in) to 8,900 mm (350 in) liquid water equivalent per year and creating large glaciers on the western side. To the east of the Southern Alps, scarcely 50 km (30 mi) from the snowy peaks, yearly rainfall drops to less than 760 mm (30 in) and some areas less than 380 mm (15 in). (see Nor&#x27;west arch for more on this subject).

===South America===

* The Atacama Desert in Chile is the driest non-polar desert on Earth because it is blocked from moisture by the Andes Mountains to the east while the Humboldt Current causes persistent atmospheric stability.
* Cuyo and Eastern Patagonia is rain shadowed from the prevailing westerly winds by the Andes range and is arid. The aridity of the lands next to eastern piedmont of the Andes decreases to the south due to a decrease in the height of the Andes with the consequence that the Patagonian Desert develop more fully at the Atlantic coast contributing to shaping the climatic pattern known as the Arid Diagonal. The Argentinian wine region of Cuyo and Northern Patagonia is almost completely dependent on irrigation, using water drawn from the many rivers that drain glacial ice from the Andes.
* The Guajira Peninsula in northern Colombia is in the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and despite its tropical latitude is almost arid, receiving almost no rainfall for seven to eight months of the year and being incapable of cultivation without irrigation.

<text>Beverly Hills is a southern suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Beverly Hills is located 15 kilometres southwest of the Sydney central business district and is part of the St George area and is split between the local government areas of the Georges River Council and the City of Canterbury-Bankstown. The postcode is 2209, which it shares with neighbouring Narwee.

Beverly Hills is mostly residential, consisting of many freestanding red brick and tile bungalows built in the years immediately after World War II. Many of these feature late Art Deco design elements. Medium density flats have been built in the areas close to King Georges Road and Stoney Creek Road.

==History==

Beverly Hills was originally known as Dumbleton after a local farm in the area, circa 1830. This name was generally disliked by residents who lobbied to supplant it with a more glamorous alternative to coincide with the arrival of the East Hills railway line, which opened 31 December 1931. The name was changed to Beverly Hills, at a time when Beverly Hills in California was becoming known for being the home of many famous movie stars. Real estate developments followed in the 1930s and 1940s. The post office opened 1 October 1940.

== Heritage listings ==
Beverly Hills has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:

* East Hills railway: Beverly Hills railway station
* Devonia Farm house
* Federation House
* Hilcrest
* Woodville

==Commercial area==

The main shopping strip is located on King Georges Road, near the Beverly Hills railway station. There are over 40 different cafes, restaurants and takeaways along King Georges Road featuring Asian, Mediterranean, and Modern Australian cuisines.

The area has all the features typical of Australian metropolitan localities: restaurants, retail shops, an IGA supermarket, real estate agents, a pub (the Beverly Hills Hotel), cinema, ATMs, kindergarten, primary/high schools, Scouts, parks, leisure and health facilities.


==Transport==
Beverly Hills railway station is on the Airport &amp; South Line of the Sydney Trains network.

The main road running through Beverly Hills is King Georges Road, connecting it north to Wiley Park and south to Blakehurst. The road has palm trees running through its median strip as a nod to its Californian namesake. The other main road in Beverly Hills is Stoney Creek Road. This road intersects King Georges Road and connects Beverly Hills west to Peakhurst and onto Menai, and east to Rockdale, Brighton-Le-Sands, Mascot and Sydney Airport.

Entrances to the M5 Motorway are located on King Georges Road, north of the shopping centre. The M5 Motorway connects east to Bexley North, Arncliffe, Sydney Airport and the Sydney CBD and west to Liverpool and Campbelltown.
Buses run along King Georges Rd connecting travellers to commercial and shopping centres at Hurstville and Roselands.

Regina Coeli Roman Catholic Church is Australia&#x27;s only Catholic war memorial church. It was built in the early 1960s to commemorate the Australian-US alliance during World War II. The flags of both nations are permanently hung on either side of the main altar, and a special Mass attended by US service personnel and diplomatic representatives is conducted there annually in commemoration of the Battle of the Coral Sea. Regina Coeli is sited prominently on the highest point in Beverly Hills, and is a landmark visible for many kilometres in all directions.

<text>An artisan (from , ) is a skilled craft worker who makes or creates material objects partly or entirely by hand. These objects may be or strictly decorative, for example furniture, decorative art, sculpture, clothing, food items, household items, and tools and mechanisms such as the handmade clockwork movement of a watchmaker. Artisans practice a craft and may through experience and aptitude reach the expressive levels of an artist.

==History==
The adjective &quot;artisanal&quot; is often used in describing hand-processing in contrast to an industrial process, such as in the phrase &quot;artisanal mining&quot;. Thus, &quot;artisanal&quot; is sometimes used in marketing and advertising as a buzz word to describe or imply some relation with the crafting of handmade food products, such as bread, beverages, cheese or textiles. Many of these have traditionally been handmade, rural or pastoral goods but are also now commonly made on a larger scale with automated mechanization in factories and other industrial areas.

Artisans were the dominant producers of primary products before the Industrial Revolution. 

In ancient Greece, artisans were drawn to agoras and often built workshops nearby.

===Medieval artisans===
During the Middle Ages, the term &quot;artisan&quot; was applied to those who made things or provided services. It did not apply to unskilled manual labourers. Artisans were divided into two distinct groups: those who operated their own businesses and those who did not. The former were called masters, while the latter were the journeymen and apprentices.

One misunderstanding many people have about this social group is that they picture them as &quot;workers&quot; in the modern sense: employed by someone. The most influential group among the artisans were the masters, the business owners. The owners enjoyed a high social status in their communities, and organised into guilds in towns and cities.

== Shokunin ==
Shokunin is a Japanese word for &quot;artisan&quot; or &quot;craftsman&quot;, which also implies a pride in one&#x27;s own work. In the words of shokunin Tashio Odate:Shokunin means not only having technical skill, but also implies an attitude and social consciousness... a social obligation to work his best for the general welfare of the people, [an] obligation both material and spiritual. Traditionally, shokunin honoured their tools of trade at New Year&#x27;s – the sharpened and taken-care of tools would be placed in a tokonoma (a container or box still found in Japanese houses and shops), and two rice cakes and a tangerine (on top of rice paper) were placed on top of each toolbox, to honour the tools and express gratitude for performing their task.

<doc id="426435" wikidata="Q2867079" url="?curid=426435" title="New Jersey Legislature">
<text>The New Jersey Legislature is the legislative branch of the government of the U.S. state of New Jersey. In its current form, as defined by the New Jersey Constitution of 1947, the Legislature consists of two houses: the General Assembly and the Senate. The Legislature meets in the New Jersey State House, in the state capital of Trenton.

==History==
===Colonial period===

The New Jersey Legislature was established in 1702 upon the surrender by the Proprietors of East Jersey and those of West Jersey of the right of government to Queen Anne. Anne&#x27;s government united the two colonies as the Province of New Jersey, a royal colony, establishing a new system of government.

The instructions from Queen Anne to Viscount Cornbury, the first royal governor of New Jersey, outlined a fusion of powers system, which allowed for an overlap of executive, legislative and judicial authority. It provided for a bicameral legislature consisting of an appointed Council and an elected General Assembly.

The Provincial Council consisted of twelve members, appointed by and serving at the pleasure of the British crown. With the exception of resignations and those being removed for cause, councilors often served for life. The former provinces of East and West Jersey were reorganized as the Eastern Division and the Western Division, respectively, of the Province of New Jersey. Councilors were apportioned that six would come from each of the two divisions. In practice, however, this was not always followed.

The Assembly initially consisted of 24 members with two each elected in the Cities of Burlington and Perth Amboy, and ten at-large from each of the two divisions. As this system proved unwieldy for holding elections, in 1709 the Assembly was reapportioned; Burlington and Perth Amboy would retain their two seats each; the Town of Salem had two, and two for each of the nine counties. The number of members remained at 24, with a total of twelve from each division. In his instructions to Governor William Burnet, King George I recommended the reapportionment of Salem&#x27;s seats to the recently formed Hunterdon County; this was passed into law on February 10, 1727/28. Membership continued at 24 until 1768, when it was expanded to 30 by the addition of two representatives each from Morris, Cumberland and Sussex Counties. This apportionment remained until superseded by the Constitution of 1776.

The Governor had the authority to summon the Legislature, and dissolve the Assembly and call new elections.

On December 6, 1775, Governor William Franklin prorogued the New Jersey Legislature until January 3, 1776, but it never met again. On May 30, 1776, Franklin attempted to convene the legislature, but was met instead with an order by the New Jersey Provincial Congress for his arrest. On July 2, 1776, the Provincial Congress approved a new constitution which ordered new elections; on August 13 an entirely new legislature was elected.

===Provincial Congress and the Constitution of 1776===

In 1775, representatives from New Jersey&#x27;s 13 counties established a Provincial Congress to supersede the Royal Governor. In June 1776, this congress had authorized the preparation of a constitution, which was written within five days, adopted by the Provincial Congress, and accepted by the Continental Congress. The Constitution of 1776 provided for a bicameral legislature consisting of a General Assembly with three members from each county and a legislative council with one member from each county. All state officials, including the governor, were to be appointed by the Legislature under this constitution. The Vice-President of Council would succeed the governor (who was the President of the Council) if a vacancy occurred in that office.

Accordingly, the first session of the legislature convened on August 27, 1776. Legislative politics was defined in the following years by an intense rivalry between the Federalists, and later the Whigs (which dominated South Jersey and Essex, Hudson, and Middlesex Counties), and the Democratic Party (which was prominent in the northwest, the Shore region, and Bergen County).

===The Constitution of 1844===
The New Jersey Constitution of 1844 provided for a direct popular election of the governor, and gave him the power to veto bills passed by the legislature. The General Assembly was expanded to 60 members, elected annually, and apportioned to the counties based on population. The Legislative Council was renamed the Senate, and was to be composed of one member from each of the state&#x27;s 19 counties, serving a three-year term.

During the Civil War, party allegiance became entrenched. Democrats usually won both houses until the Republicans gained control in 1893. A court ruling obtained by the Republicans provided that members of the General Assembly were to be elected from the counties at large, rather than from election districts of unequal population.

Regardless of any changes, the legislature met infrequently, had high turnover among its members, and was far from being the most influential or powerful organ of state government.

===New Jersey Constitution of 1947 and modern developments===

New Jersey adopted its current constitution in 1947. Under this constitution, the governor was given additional veto powers and the ability to serve two terms. Hundreds of independent agencies were consolidated into 20 principal executive departments under the control of the governor. Senators&#x27; terms were extended to four years; assemblymen&#x27;s terms to two years.

In 1966, the Senate was expanded from 21 to 40 members and the General Assembly from 60 to 80. Following a United States Supreme Court decision in 1964 and a New Jersey Supreme Court decision in 1972, the state&#x27;s legislative districts were reapportioned into the current arrangement. Two more modern developments have also helped shape the Legislature: the increase in the importance of legislative committees and the development of longer tenures for the legislative leadership.

==== New Jersey Legislative Youth Council ====
In 2022, the legislature passed the New Jersey Legislative Youth Council Act, which established the New Jersey Youth Council, a youth advisory body to the New Jersey Legislature made up of 40 public members aged 15 to 23, each from one of the state&#x27;s legislative districts. The council is set to meet for the first time in 2023 and submit an annual report to the legislature regarding its findings.

==Organization==

===Powers===
The Legislature has the power to enact laws by a majority vote of both houses, subject to the Governor of New Jersey&#x27;s ability to veto a bill. A veto may be overridden by the Legislature if there is a two-thirds majority in favor of overriding in each House.

By a three-fifths vote of each house, the Legislature may propose an amendment to the Constitution of New Jersey. Alternatively, it may propose an amendment by a majority vote two consecutive years. In either case, the amendment is placed on the ballot and must be approved in a referendum to become a part of the constitution.

The Legislature is also empowered to ratify amendments to the U.S. Constitution, appoint the State Auditor, judge the elections and qualifications of its members, and institute and conduct impeachment proceedings against State officials. The Senate has the sole authority to confirm or reject gubernatorial nominees for judicial and some executive positions.

===Houses, members, and qualifications===
The current organization of the Legislature is outlined by Article IV (&quot;Legislative&quot;) of the New Jersey State Constitution of 1947. The Legislature is composed of an 80-member General Assembly and a 40-member Senate. To become a member of the Assembly, an individual must be at least 21 years old, must have resided in their district for one year and the state for two years, and must live in the represented district. To become a Senator, an individual must be 30 years old, must have lived in their district for two years and the state for four years, and again must live in the represented district.

===Elections and terms===
Unlike elections for most other state legislatures and for the United States Congress, New Jersey legislative elections are held in November of every odd-numbered year. Assembly members serve two-year terms, while Senators serve four-year terms, except in the first term of a new decade, which only lasts two years. This &quot;2-4-4&quot; cycle was put into place so Senate elections can reflect changes made to district boundaries following the decennial United States Census. If this cycle were not in place, then the boundaries could at times be up to four years out of date before being used for Senate elections. Under the current system, the boundaries are only ever two years out of date.

The New Jersey Constitution provides that each Legislature is constituted for a term of two years, split into two annual sessions. Because the Constitution also specifies that all business from the first year may be continued into the second year, the distinction between the two annual sessions is more ceremonial than actual. The two-year legislative term begins at noon on the second Tuesday in January of each even-numbered year. For example, the two-year term of the 215th Legislative session began on noon on Tuesday, January 10, 2012. At the end of the second year, all unfinished business expires.

Service in the Legislature is considered part-time, and most legislators have other employment. In New Jersey, legislators previously could also concurrently hold another elected office at the county or municipal level. The practice, which is frequently referred to as &quot;double dipping&quot;, was banned by the Legislature in 2008, although the 19 legislators holding multiple offices as of February 1, 2008, were grandfathered into the system. 

===Leadership===
The General Assembly is headed by a Speaker, while the Senate is headed by a President. Each house also has a Majority Leader, a Minority Leader, assistant leaders, and whips.

===Legislative districts===

Members of the New Jersey Legislature are chosen from 40 electoral districts. Each district elects one Senator and two Assemblymen. New Jersey is one of seven U.S. states (with Arizona, Idaho, Maryland, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Washington) in which districts for the upper and lower house of the legislature are coterminous. Districts are redefined decennially by the New Jersey Apportionment Commission following each U.S. Census, as provided by Article IV, Section III of the State Constitution.

==Current legislature==
The sitting Legislature is the 221st New Jersey Legislature.

===Senate===

The New Jersey Senate was established as the upper house of the New Jersey Legislature by the Constitution of 1844, replacing the Legislative Council. There are 40 legislative districts, representing districts with average populations of 232,225 (2020 figure). Each district has one senator and two members of the New Jersey General Assembly, the lower house of the legislature. Prior to the election in which they are chosen, senators must be a minimum of 30 years old and a resident of the state for four years to be eligible to serve in office.

From 1844 until 1965 (when the &quot;Reynolds v. Sims&quot; US Supreme Court decision mandated all state legislators be elected from districts of roughly equal population), each county was an electoral district electing one senator. Under the 1844 Constitution the term of office was three years, which was changed to four years with the 1947 Constitution. Since 1968 the Senate has consisted of 40 senators, who are elected in a &quot;2-4-4&quot; cycle. Senators serve a two-year term at the beginning of each decade, with the rest of the decade divided into two four-year terms. The &quot;2-4-4&quot; cycle was put into place so that Senate elections can reflect the changes made to the district boundaries on the basis of the decennial United States Census. If the cycle were not put into place, then the boundaries would sometimes be four years out of date before being used for Senate elections. Rather, with the varied term, the boundaries are only two years out of date. Thus elections for Senate seats take place in years ending with a &quot;1&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, or &quot;7&quot; (i.e. next elections in 2023, 2027, and 2031).

Interim appointments are made to fill vacant legislative seats by the county committee or committees of the party of the vacating person (since a constitutional amendment passed on November 8, 1988). The office is on the ballot for the next general election, even if the other Senate seats are not up for election in that year (such as in years ending with a &quot;5&quot; or &quot;9&quot;, such as 2009 or 2015). The sole exception to this is if the vacancy occurred within 51 days of the election, in which case the appointment stands until the following general election.

===General Assembly===

Since the election of 1967 (1968 Session), the Assembly has consisted of 80 members. Two members are elected from each of New Jersey&#x27;s 40 legislative districts for a term of two years, each representing districts with average populations of 232,225 (2020 figures), with deviation in each district not exceeding 3.21% above and below that average. To be eligible to run, a potential candidate must be at least 21 years of age, and must have lived in their district for at least one year prior to the election, and have lived in the state of New Jersey for two years. They also must be residents of their districts. Membership in the Assembly is considered a part-time job, and many members have employment in addition to their legislative work. Assembly members serve two-year terms, elected every odd-numbered year in November. Four current members of the Assembly hold other elective office, as they are grandfathered in under a New Jersey law that banned multiple office holding in 2007.

The Assembly is led by the Speaker of the Assembly, who is elected by the membership of the chamber. After the Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey and the President of the New Jersey Senate, the Speaker of the Assembly is third in the line of succession to replace the Governor of New Jersey in the event that the governor is unable to execute the duties of that office. The Speaker decides the schedule for the Assembly, which bills will be considered, appoints committee chairmen, and generally runs the Assembly&#x27;s agenda. The current Speaker is Craig Coughlin (D-Woodbridge Township).

<text>Nisargadatta Maharaj (born Maruti Shivrampant Kambli; 17 April 1897 – 8 September 1981) was an Indian guru of nondualism, belonging to the Inchagiri Sampradaya, a lineage of teachers from the Navnath Sampradaya.

The publication in 1973 of &quot;I Am That&quot;, an English translation of his talks in Marathi by Maurice Frydman, brought him worldwide recognition and followers, especially from North America and Europe.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Nisargadatta was born on 17 April 1897 to Shivrampant Kambli and Parvati bai, in Bombay. The day was also &quot;Hanuman Jayanti&quot;, the birthday of Hanuman, hence the boy was named &#x27;Maruti&#x27;, after him. His parents were followers of the Varkari sampradaya, Vaishnavite bhakti tradition which worships Vithoba. His father, Shivrampant, worked as a domestic servant in Mumbai and later became a petty farmer in Kandalgaon.

Maruti Shivrampant Kambli was brought up in Kandalgaon, a small village in the Sindhudurga district of Maharashtra, with his two brothers, four sisters and deeply religious parents. In 1915, after his father died, he moved to Bombay to support his family back home, following his elder brother. Initially he worked as a junior clerk at an office but quickly he opened a small goods store, mainly selling beedis (leaf-rolled cigarettes) and soon owned a string of eight retail shops. In 1924 he married Sumatibai and they had three daughters and a son.

===Sadhana===

In 1933, he was introduced to his guru, Siddharameshwar Maharaj, the head of the Inchegiri branch of the Navnath Sampradaya, by his friend Yashwantrao Baagkar. His guru told him, &quot;You are not what you take yourself to be...&quot;. Siddharameshwar initiated him into the Inchegiri Sampradaya, giving him meditation-instruction and a mantra, which he immediately began to recite. Siddharameshwar gave Nisargadatta instructions for self-enquiry which he followed verbatim, as he himself recounted later:
Following his guru&#x27;s instructions to concentrate on the feeling &quot;I Am&quot;, he used all his spare time looking at himself in silence, and remained in that state for the coming years, practising meditation and singing devotional bhajans:
After an association that lasted hardly two and a half years, Siddharameshwar Maharaj died on 9 November 1936. In 1937, Maharaj left Mumbai and travelled across India. After eight months he returned to his family in Mumbai in 1938. On the journey home his state of mind changed, realizing that &quot;nothing was wrong anymore.&quot; He spent the rest of his life in Mumbai, maintaining one shop to earn an income.

===Later years===
Between 1942 and 1948 he suffered two personal losses, first the death of his wife, Sumatibai, followed by the death of his daughter. He started to give initiations in 1951, after a personal revelation from his guru, Siddharameshwar Maharaj.

After he retired from his shop in 1966, Nisargadatta Maharaj continued to receive and teach visitors in his home, giving discourses twice a day, until his death on 8 September 1981 at the age of 84, of throat cancer.

==Teachings==

===Style of teaching===
Nisargadatta gave talks and answered questions at his humble flat in Khetwadi, Mumbai, where a mezzanine room was created for him to receive disciples and visitors. This room was also used for daily chantings, bhajans (devotional songs), meditation sessions, and discourses.

Cathy Boucher notes that the Inchagiri Sampradaya emphasized mantra meditation from its inception in the early 19th century, but that the emphasis shifted toward a form of Self-enquiry with Sri Siddharameshwar. Nevertheless,
Boucher also notes that Nisargadatta adopted a different mode of instruction, through questions and answers, for his western disciples. Many of Nisargadatta Maharaj&#x27;s talks were recorded, and formed the basis of &quot;I Am That&quot; as well as of the several other books attributed to him.

===Awareness of true nature===
According to Timothy Conway, Nisargadatta&#x27;s only subject was
Nisargadatta explains:
In &quot;Consciousness and the Absolute&quot;, Nisargadatta Maharaj further explains:

===Self-enquiry===
According to Conway, awareness of the Absolute could be regained by
===Devotion and mantra repetition===
Nisargadatta was critical of a merely intellectual approach to nondual Truth. He had a strong devotional zeal towards his own guru, and suggested the path of devotion, Bhakti yoga, to some of his visitors, as he believed the path of knowledge, Jnana yoga was not the only approach to Truth. Nisargadatta also emphasized love of Guru and God, and the practice of mantra repetition and singing bhajans, devotional songs.

===Scriptures===
According to Timothy Conway, Nisargadatta often read Marathi scriptures: Nath saint Jnanesvar&#x27;s Amrutanubhav and Jnanesvari (Gita Commentary); Varkari Sants, namely Eknatha&#x27;s Bhagavat (&quot;Eknathi Bhagavata&quot;, a rewrite of the &quot;Bhagavad Purana&quot;), Ramdas&#x27; Dasbodha, and Tukaram&#x27;s poems; but also the Yoga Vasistha, Adi Shankara&#x27;s treatises, and some major Upanishads.

=== Nisarga Yoga ===
Nisargadatta taught what has been called &quot;Nisarga Yoga&quot; (Nisarga can be translated as &quot;nature&quot;). In &quot;I Am That&quot;, Nisarga Yoga is defined as living life with &quot;harmlessness,&quot; &quot;friendliness,&quot; and &quot;interest,&quot; abiding in &quot;spontaneous awareness&quot; while being &quot;conscious of effortless living.&quot; The practice of this form of Yoga involves meditating on one&#x27;s sense of &quot;I am&quot;, &quot;being&quot; or &quot;consciousness&quot; with the aim of reaching its ultimate source prior to this sense, which Nisargadatta called the &quot;Self&quot;.

The second edition of &quot;I Am That&quot; includes an epilogue titled Nisarga Yoga by Maurice Frydman which includes this passage:Nisargadatta did not prescribe a specific practice for self-knowledge but advised his disciples, &quot;Don&#x27;t pretend to be what you are not, don&#x27;t refuse to be what you are.&quot; By means of self-enquiry, he advised, &quot;Why don&#x27;t you enquire how real are the world and the person?&quot;. Nisargadatta frequently spoke about the importance of having the &quot;inner conviction&quot; about one&#x27;s true nature and without such Self-knowledge one would continue to suffer. Nisargadatta claimed that the names of the Hindu deities Shiva, Rama and Krishna were the names of nature (Nisarga) personified, and that all of life arises from the same non-dual source or Self. Remembrance of this source was the core of Nisargadatta&#x27;s message:The Seven Principles of Nisarga Yoga (As identified by Nic Higham, 2018) 

# Non-identification and right understanding
# Interest and earnestness
# Spontaneity and effortlessness
# Attentiveness to being
# Right action
# Going within to go beyond
# Awareness of Self

==Lineage==
===Disciples===
Among his best known disciples are Maurice Frydman, Sailor Bob Adamson, Stephen Howard Wolinsky (born 31 January 1950), Jean Dunn, Alexander Smit (Sri Parabrahmadatta Maharaj) (1948-1998), Douwe Tiemersma (7 January 1945 – 3 January 2013), Robert Powell, Timothy Conway, Wayne Dyer and Ramesh Balsekar (1917-2009). A less well known disciple is Sri Ramakant Maharaj (born 8 July 1941), who received the naam mantra from Nisargadatta in 1962, spent the next 19 years with the master. and claims to be &quot;the only Indian direct disciple of Shri Nisargadatta Maharaj&quot; who offers initiation into this lineage. Sachin Kshirsagar, who has published a series of books on Nisargadatta in the Marathi language and also re-published &quot;Master of Self Realization&quot;, says to have received the Naam (Mantra) in a dream from Shree Nisargadatta Maharaj on 17 Oct., 2011.

===Successors===
David Godman gives the following account of an explanation by Nisargadatta of the succession of Gurus in the Inchagiri Sampradaya:
According to David Godman, Nisargadatta was not allowed by Siddharameshwar to appoint a successor, because he &quot;wasn&#x27;t realised himself when Siddharameshwar passed away.&quot; Nisargadatta started to initiate others in 1951, after receiving an inner revelation from Siddharameshwar. Nisargadatta himself explains:

<text>An ice core is a core sample that is typically removed from an ice sheet or a high mountain glacier. Since the ice forms from the incremental buildup of annual layers of snow, lower layers are older than upper ones, and an ice core contains ice formed over a range of years. Cores are drilled with hand augers (for shallow holes) or powered drills; they can reach depths of over two miles (3.2 km), and contain ice up to 800,000 years old.

The physical properties of the ice and of material trapped in it can be used to reconstruct the climate over the age range of the core. The proportions of different oxygen and hydrogen isotopes provide information about ancient temperatures, and the air trapped in tiny bubbles can be analysed to determine the level of atmospheric gases such as carbon dioxide. Since heat flow in a large ice sheet is very slow, the borehole temperature is another indicator of temperature in the past. This data can be combined to find the climate model that best fits all the available data.

Impurities in ice cores may depend on location. Coastal areas are more likely to include material of marine origin, such as sea salt ions. Greenland ice cores contain layers of wind-blown dust that correlate with cold, dry periods in the past, when cold deserts were scoured by wind. Radioactive elements, either of natural origin or created by nuclear testing, can be used to date the layers of ice. Some volcanic events that were sufficiently powerful to send material around the globe have left a signature in many different cores that can be used to synchronise their time scales.

Ice cores have been studied since the early 20th century, and several cores were drilled as a result of the International Geophysical Year (1957–1958). Depths of over 400 m were reached, a record which was extended in the 1960s to 2164 m at Byrd Station in Antarctica. Soviet ice drilling projects in Antarctica include decades of work at Vostok Station, with the deepest core reaching 3769 m. Numerous other deep cores in the Antarctic have been completed over the years, including the West Antarctic Ice Sheet project, and cores managed by the British Antarctic Survey and the International Trans-Antarctic Scientific Expedition. In Greenland, a sequence of collaborative projects began in the 1970s with the Greenland Ice Sheet Project; there have been multiple follow-up projects, with the most recent, the East Greenland Ice-Core Project, originally expected to complete a deep core in east Greenland in 2020 but since postponed.

== Structure of ice sheets and cores ==

An ice core is a vertical column through a glacier, sampling the layers that formed through an annual cycle of snowfall and melt. As snow accumulates, each layer presses on lower layers, making them denser until they turn into firn. Firn is not dense enough to prevent air from escaping; but at a density of about 830 kg/m3 it turns to ice, and the air within is sealed into bubbles that capture the composition of the atmosphere at the time the ice formed. The depth at which this occurs varies with location, but in Greenland and the Antarctic it ranges from 64 m to 115 m. Because the rate of snowfall varies from site to site, the age of the firn when it turns to ice varies a great deal. At Summit Camp in Greenland, the depth is 77 m and the ice is 230 years old; at Dome C in Antarctica the depth is 95 m and the age 2500 years. As further layers build up, the pressure increases, and at about 1500 m the crystal structure of the ice changes from hexagonal to cubic, allowing air molecules to move into the cubic crystals and form a clathrate. The bubbles disappear and the ice becomes more transparent.

Two or three feet of snow may turn into less than a foot of ice. The weight above makes deeper layers of ice thin and flow outwards. Ice is lost at the edges of the glacier to icebergs, or to summer melting, and the overall shape of the glacier does not change much with time. The outward flow can distort the layers, so it is desirable to drill deep ice cores at places where there is very little flow. These can be located using maps of the flow lines.

Impurities in the ice provide information on the environment from when they were deposited. These include soot, ash, and other types of particle from forest fires and volcanoes; isotopes such as beryllium-10 created by cosmic rays;
micrometeorites; and pollen. The lowest layer of a glacier, called basal ice, is frequently formed of subglacial meltwater that has refrozen. It can be up to about 20 m thick, and though it has scientific value (for example, it may contain subglacial microbial populations), it often does not retain stratigraphic information.

Cores are often drilled in areas such as Antarctica and central Greenland where the temperature is almost never warm enough to cause melting, but the summer sunlight can still alter the snow. In polar areas, the Sun is visible day and night during the local summer and invisible all winter. It can make some snow sublimate, leaving the top inch or so less dense. When the Sun approaches its lowest point in the sky, the temperature drops and hoar frost forms on the top layer. Buried under the snow of following years, the coarse-grained hoar frost compresses into lighter layers than the winter snow. As a result, alternating bands of lighter and darker ice can be seen in an ice core.

== Coring ==
Ice cores are collected by cutting around a cylinder of ice in a way that enables it to be brought to the surface. Early cores were often collected with hand augers and they are still used for short holes. A design for ice core augers was patented in 1932 and they have changed little since. An auger is essentially a cylinder with helical metal ribs (known as flights) wrapped around the outside, at the lower end of which are cutting blades. Hand augers can be rotated by a T handle or a brace handle, and some can be attached to handheld electric drills to power the rotation. With the aid of a tripod for lowering and raising the auger, cores up to 50 m deep can be retrieved, but the practical limit is about 30 m for engine-powered augers, and less for hand augers. Below this depth, electromechanical or thermal drills are used.

The cutting apparatus of a drill is on the bottom end of a drill barrel, the tube that surrounds the core as the drill cuts downward. The cuttings (chips of ice cut away by the drill) must be drawn up the hole and disposed of or they will reduce the cutting efficiency of the drill. They can be removed by compacting them into the walls of the hole or into the core, by air circulation (dry drilling), or by the use of a drilling fluid (wet drilling). Dry drilling is limited to about 400 m depth, since below that point a hole would close up as the ice deforms from the weight of the ice above.

Drilling fluids are chosen to balance the pressure so that the hole remains stable. The fluid must have a low kinematic viscosity to reduce tripping time (the time taken to pull the drilling equipment out of the hole and return it to the bottom of the hole). Since retrieval of each segment of core requires tripping, a slower speed of travel through the drilling fluid could add significant time to a project—a year or more for a deep hole. The fluid must contaminate the ice as little as possible; it must have low toxicity, for safety and to minimize the effect on the environment; it must be available at a reasonable cost; and it must be relatively easy to transport. Historically, there have been three main types of ice drilling fluids: two-component fluids based on kerosene-like products mixed with fluorocarbons to increase density; alcohol compounds, including aqueous ethylene glycol and ethanol solutions; and esters, including n-butyl acetate. Newer fluids have been proposed, including new ester-based fluids, low-molecular weight dimethyl siloxane oils, fatty-acid esters, and kerosene-based fluids mixed with foam-expansion agents.

Rotary drilling is the main method of drilling for minerals and it has also been used for ice drilling. It uses a string of drill pipe rotated from the top, and drilling fluid is pumped down through the pipe and back up around it. The cuttings are removed from the fluid at the top of the hole and the fluid is then pumped back down. This approach requires long trip times, since the entire drill string must be hoisted out of the hole, and each length of pipe must be separately disconnected, and then reconnected when the drill string is reinserted. Along with the logistical difficulties associated with bringing heavy equipment to ice sheets, this makes traditional rotary drills unattractive. In contrast, wireline drills allow the removal of the core barrel from the drill assembly while it is still at the bottom of the borehole. The core barrel is hoisted to the surface, and the core removed; the barrel is lowered again and reconnected to the drill assembly. Another alternative is flexible drill-stem rigs, in which the drill string is flexible enough to be coiled when at the surface. This eliminates the need to disconnect and reconnect the pipes during a trip. The need for a string of drillpipe that extends from the surface to the bottom of the borehole can be eliminated by suspending the entire downhole assembly on an armoured cable that conveys power to the downhole motor. These cable-suspended drills can be used for both shallow and deep holes; they require an anti-torque device, such as leaf-springs that press against the borehole, to prevent the drill assembly rotating around the drillhead as it cuts the core. The drilling fluid is usually circulated down around the outside of the drill and back up between the core and core barrel; the cuttings are stored in the downhole assembly, in a chamber above the core. When the core is retrieved, the cuttings chamber is emptied for the next run. Some drills have been designed to retrieve a second annular core outside the central core, and in these drills the space between the two cores can be used for circulation. Cable-suspended drills have proved to be the most reliable design for deep ice drilling.

Thermal drills, which cut ice by electrically heating the drill head, can also be used, but they have some disadvantages. Some have been designed for working in cold ice; they have high power consumption and the heat they produce can degrade the quality of the retrieved ice core. Early thermal drills, designed for use without drilling fluid, were limited in depth as a result; later versions were modified to work in fluid-filled holes but this slowed down trip times, and these drills retained the problems of the earlier models. In addition, thermal drills are typically bulky and can be impractical to use in areas where there are logistical difficulties. More recent modifications include the use of antifreeze, which eliminates the need for heating the drill assembly and hence reduces the power needs of the drill. Hot-water drills use jets of hot water at the drill head to melt the water around the core. The drawbacks are that it is difficult to accurately control the dimensions of the borehole, the core cannot easily be kept sterile, and the heat may cause thermal shock to the core.

When drilling in temperate ice, thermal drills have an advantage over electromechanical (EM) drills: ice melted by pressure can refreeze on EM drill bits, reducing cutting efficiency, and can clog other parts of the mechanism. EM drills are also more likely to fracture ice cores where the ice is under high stress.

When drilling deep holes, which require drilling fluid, the hole must be cased (fitted with a cylindrical lining), since otherwise the drilling fluid will be absorbed by the snow and firn. The casing has to reach down to the impermeable ice layers. To install casing a shallow auger can be used to create a pilot hole, which is then reamed (expanded) until it is wide enough to accept the casing; a large diameter auger can also be used, avoiding the need for reaming. An alternative to casing is to use water in the borehole to saturate the porous snow and firn; the water eventually turns to ice.

Ice cores from different depths are not all equally in demand by scientific investigators, which can lead to a shortage of ice cores at certain depths. To address this, work has been done on technology to drill replicate cores: additional cores, retrieved by drilling into the sidewall of the borehole, at depths of particular interest. Replicate cores were successfully retrieved at WAIS divide in the 2012–2013 drilling season, at four different depths.

=== Large coring projects ===
The logistics of any coring project are complex because the locations are usually difficult to reach, and may be at high altitude. The largest projects require years of planning and years to execute, and are usually run as international consortiums. The EastGRIP project, for example, which as of 2017 is drilling in eastern Greenland, is run by the Centre for Ice and Climate (Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen) in Denmark, and includes representatives from 12 countries on its steering committee. Over the course of a drilling season, scores of people work at the camp, and logistics support includes airlift capabilities provided by the US Air National Guard, using Hercules transport planes owned by the National Science Foundation. In 2015 the EastGRIP team moved the camp facilities from NEEM, a previous Greenland ice core drilling site, to the EastGRIP site. Drilling is expected to continue until at least 2020.

== Core processing ==
With some variation between projects, the following steps must occur between drilling and final storage of the ice core.

The drill removes an annulus of ice around the core but does not cut under it. A spring-loaded lever arm called a core dog can break off the core and hold it in place while it is brought to the surface. The core is then extracted from the drill barrel, usually by laying it out flat so that the core can slide out onto a prepared surface. The core must be cleaned of drilling fluid as it is slid out; for the WAIS Divide coring project, a vacuuming system was set up to facilitate this. The surface that receives the core should be aligned as accurately as possible with the drill barrel to minimise mechanical stress on the core, which can easily break. The ambient temperature is kept well below freezing to avoid thermal shock.

A log is kept with information about the core, including its length and the depth it was retrieved from, and the core may be marked to show its orientation. It is usually cut into shorter sections, the standard length in the US being one metre. The cores are then stored on site, usually in a space below snow level to simplify temperature maintenance, though additional refrigeration can be used. If more drilling fluid must be removed, air may be blown over the cores. Any samples needed for preliminary analysis are taken. The core is then bagged, often in polythene, and stored for shipment. Additional packing, including padding material, is added. When the cores are flown from the drilling site, the aircraft&#x27;s flight deck is unheated to help maintain a low temperature; when they are transported by ship they must be kept in a refrigeration unit.

There are several locations around the world that store ice cores, such as the National Ice Core Laboratory in the US. These locations make samples available for testing. A substantial fraction of each core is archived for future analyses.

=== Brittle ice ===

Over a depth range known as the brittle ice zone, bubbles of air are trapped in the ice under great pressure. When the core is brought to the surface, the bubbles can exert a stress that exceeds the tensile strength of the ice, resulting in cracks and spall. At greater depths, the air disappears into clathrates and the ice becomes stable again. At the WAIS Divide site, the brittle ice zone was from 520 m to 1340 m depth.

The brittle ice zone typically returns poorer quality samples than for the rest of the core. Some steps can be taken to alleviate the problem. Liners can be placed inside the drill barrel to enclose the core before it is brought to the surface, but this makes it difficult to clean off the drilling fluid. In mineral drilling, special machinery can bring core samples to the surface at bottom-hole pressure, but this is too expensive for the inaccessible locations of most drilling sites. Keeping the processing facilities at very low temperatures limits thermal shocks. Cores are most brittle at the surface, so another approach is to break them into 1 m lengths in the hole. Extruding the core from the drill barrel into a net helps keep it together if it shatters. Brittle cores are also often allowed to rest in storage at the drill site for some time, up to a full year between drilling seasons, to let the ice gradually relax.

=== Dating ===

Many different kinds of analysis are performed on ice cores, including visual layer counting, tests for electrical conductivity and physical properties, and assays for inclusion of gases, particles, radionuclides, and various molecular species. For the results of these tests to be useful in the reconstruction of palaeoenvironments, there has to be a way to determine the relationship between depth and age of the ice. The simplest approach is to count layers of ice that correspond to the original annual layers of snow, but this is not always possible. An alternative is to model the ice accumulation and flow to predict how long it takes a given snowfall to reach a particular depth. Another method is to correlate radionuclides or trace atmospheric gases with other timescales such as periodicities in the earth&#x27;s orbital parameters.

A difficulty in ice core dating is that gases can diffuse through firn, so the ice at a given depth may be substantially older than the gases trapped in it. As a result, there are two chronologies for a given ice core: one for the ice, and one for the trapped gases. To determine the relationship between the two, models have been developed for the depth at which gases are trapped for a given location, but their predictions have not always proved reliable. At locations with very low snowfall, such as Vostok, the uncertainty in the difference between ages of ice and gas can be over 1,000 years.

The density and size of the bubbles trapped in ice provide an indication of crystal size at the time they formed. The size of a crystal is related to its growth rate, which in turn depends on the temperature, so the properties of the bubbles can be combined with information on accumulation rates and firn density to calculate the temperature when the firn formed.

Radiocarbon dating can be used on the carbon in trapped . In the polar ice sheets there is about 15–20 μg of carbon in the form of in each kilogram of ice, and there may also be carbonate particles from wind-blown dust (loess). The can be isolated by subliming the ice in a vacuum, keeping the temperature low enough to avoid the loess giving up any carbon. The results have to be corrected for the presence of  produced directly in the ice by cosmic rays, and the amount of correction depends strongly on the location of the ice core. Corrections for produced by nuclear testing have much less impact on the results. Carbon in particulates can also be dated by separating and testing the water-insoluble organic components of dust. The very small quantities typically found require at least 300 g of ice to be used, limiting the ability of the technique to precisely assign an age to core depths.

Timescales for ice cores from the same hemisphere can usually be synchronised using layers that include material from volcanic events. It is more difficult to connect the timescales in different hemispheres. The Laschamp event, a geomagnetic reversal about 40,000 years ago, can be identified in cores; away from that point, measurements of gases such as (methane) can be used to connect the chronology of a Greenland core (for example) with an Antarctic core. In cases where volcanic tephra is interspersed with ice, it can be dated using argon/argon dating and hence provide fixed points for dating the ice. Uranium decay has also been used to date ice cores. Another approach is to use Bayesian probability techniques to find the optimal combination of multiple independent records. This approach was developed in 2010 and has since been turned into a software tool, DatIce.

The boundary between the Pleistocene and the Holocene, about 11,700 years ago, is now formally defined with reference to data on Greenland ice cores. Formal definitions of stratigraphic boundaries allow scientists in different locations to correlate their findings. These often involve fossil records, which are not present in ice cores, but cores have extremely precise palaeoclimatic information that can be correlated with other climate proxies.

The dating of ice sheets has proved to be a key element in providing dates for palaeoclimatic records. According to Richard Alley, &quot;In many ways, ice cores are the &#x27;rosetta stones&#x27; that allow development of a global network of accurately dated paleoclimatic records using the best ages determined anywhere on the planet&quot;.

=== Visual analysis ===
Cores show visible layers, which correspond to annual snowfall at the core site. If a pair of pits is dug in fresh snow with a thin wall between them and one of the pits is roofed over, an observer in the roofed pit will see the layers revealed by sunlight shining through. A six-foot pit may show anything from less than a year of snow to several years of snow, depending on the location. Poles left in the snow from year to year show the amount of accumulated snow each year, and this can be used to verify that the visible layer in a snow pit corresponds to a single year&#x27;s snowfall.

In central Greenland a typical year might produce two or three feet of winter snow, plus a few inches of summer snow. When this turns to ice, the two layers will make up no more than a foot of ice. The layers corresponding to the summer snow will contain bigger bubbles than the winter layers, so the alternating layers remain visible, which makes it possible to count down a core and determine the age of each layer. As the depth increases to the point where the ice structure changes to a clathrate, the bubbles are no longer visible, and the layers can no longer be seen. Dust layers may now become visible. Ice from Greenland cores contains dust carried by wind; the dust appears most strongly in late winter, and appears as cloudy grey layers. These layers are stronger and easier to see at times in the past when the Earth&#x27;s climate was cold, dry, and windy.

Any method of counting layers eventually runs into difficulties as the flow of the ice causes the layers to become thinner and harder to see with increasing depth. The problem is more acute at locations where accumulation is high; low accumulation sites, such as central Antarctica, must be dated by other methods. For example, at Vostok, layer counting is only possible down to an age of 55,000 years.

When there is summer melting, the melted snow refreezes lower in the snow and firn, and the resulting layer of ice has very few bubbles so is easy to recognise in a visual examination of a core. Identification of these layers, both visually and by measuring density of the core against depth, allows the calculation of a melt-feature percentage (MF): an MF of 100% would mean that every year&#x27;s deposit of snow showed evidence of melting. MF calculations are averaged over multiple sites or long time periods in order to smooth the data. Plots of MF data over time reveal variations in the climate, and have shown that since the late 20th century melting rates have been increasing.

In addition to manual inspection and logging of features identified in a visual inspection, cores can be optically scanned so that a digital visual record is available. This requires the core to be cut lengthwise, so that a flat surface is created.

=== Isotopic analysis ===
The isotopic composition of the oxygen in a core can be used to model the temperature history of the ice sheet. Oxygen has three stable isotopes, , and . The ratio between and indicates the temperature when the snow fell. Because is lighter than , water containing is slightly more likely to turn into vapour, and water containing is slightly more likely to condense from vapour into rain or snow crystals. At lower temperatures, the difference is more pronounced. The standard method of recording the / ratio is to subtract the ratio in a standard known as standard mean ocean water (SMOW):

formula_1

where the ‰ sign indicates parts per thousand. A sample with the same / ratio as SMOW has a of 0‰; a sample that is depleted in has a negative . Combining the measurements of an ice core sample with the borehole temperature at the depth it came from provides additional information, in some cases leading to significant corrections to the temperatures deduced from the data. Not all boreholes can be used in these analyses. If the site has experienced significant melting in the past, the borehole will no longer preserve an accurate temperature record.

Hydrogen ratios can also be used to calculate a temperature history. Deuterium (, or D) is heavier than hydrogen () and makes water more likely to condense and less likely to evaporate. A ratio can be defined in the same way as . There is a linear relationship between and :

formula_2

where d is the deuterium excess. It was once thought that this meant it was unnecessary to measure both ratios in a given core, but in 1979 Merlivat and Jouzel showed that the deuterium excess reflects the temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed of the ocean where the moisture originated. Since then it has been customary to measure both.

Water isotope records, analyzed in cores from Camp Century and Dye 3 in Greenland, were instrumental in the discovery of Dansgaard-Oeschger events—rapid warming at the onset of an interglacial, followed by slower cooling. Other isotopic ratios have been studied, for example, the ratio between and can provide information about past changes in the carbon cycle. Combining this information with records of carbon dioxide levels, also obtained from ice cores, provides information about the mechanisms behind changes in over time.

=== Palaeoatmospheric sampling ===

It was understood in the 1960s that analyzing the air trapped in ice cores would provide useful information on the paleoatmosphere, but it was not until the late 1970s that a reliable extraction method was developed. Early results included a demonstration that the concentration was 30% less at the last glacial maximum than just before the start of the industrial age. Further research has demonstrated a reliable correlation between levels and the temperature calculated from ice isotope data.

Because (methane) is produced in lakes and wetlands, the amount in the atmosphere is correlated with the strength of monsoons, which are in turn correlated with the strength of low-latitude summer insolation. Since insolation depends on orbital cycles, for which a timescale is available from other sources, can be used to determine the relationship between core depth and age. (nitrous oxide) levels are also correlated with glacial cycles, though at low temperatures the graph differs somewhat from the and graphs. Similarly, the ratio between (nitrogen) and (oxygen) can be used to date ice cores: as air is gradually trapped by the snow turning to firn and then ice, is lost more easily than , and the relative amount of correlates with the strength of local summer insolation. This means that the trapped air retains, in the ratio of to , a record of the summer insolation, and hence combining this data with orbital cycle data establishes an ice core dating scheme.

Diffusion within the firn layer causes other changes that can be measured. Gravity causes heavier molecules to be enriched at the bottom of a gas column, with the amount of enrichment depending on the difference in mass between the molecules. Colder temperatures cause heavier molecules to be more enriched at the bottom of a column. These fractionation processes in trapped air, determined by the measurement of the / ratio and of neon, krypton and xenon, have been used to infer the thickness of the firn layer, and determine other palaeoclimatic information such as past mean ocean temperatures. Some gases such as helium can rapidly diffuse through ice, so it may be necessary to test for these &quot;fugitive gases&quot; within minutes of the core being retrieved to obtain accurate data. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which contribute to the greenhouse effect and also cause ozone loss in the stratosphere, can be detected in ice cores after about 1950; almost all CFCs in the atmosphere were created by human activity.

Greenland cores, during times of climatic transition, may show excess in air bubbles when analysed, due to production by acidic and alkaline impurities.

=== Glaciochemistry ===
Summer snow in Greenland contains some sea salt, blown from the surrounding waters; there is less of it in winter, when much of the sea surface is covered by pack ice. Similarly, hydrogen peroxide appears only in summer snow because its production in the atmosphere requires sunlight. These seasonal changes can be detected because they lead to changes in the electrical conductivity of the ice. Placing two electrodes with a high voltage between them on the surface of the ice core gives a measurement of the conductivity at that point. Dragging them down the length of the core, and recording the conductivity at each point, gives a graph that shows an annual periodicity. Such graphs also identify chemical changes caused by non-seasonal events such as forest fires and major volcanic eruptions. When a known volcanic event, such as the eruption of Laki in Iceland in 1783, can be identified in the ice core record, it provides a cross-check on the age determined by layer counting. Material from Laki can be identified in Greenland ice cores, but did not spread as far as Antarctica; the 1815 eruption of Tambora in Indonesia injected material into the stratosphere, and can be identified in both Greenland and Antarctic ice cores. If the date of the eruption is not known, but it can be identified in multiple cores, then dating the ice can in turn give a date for the eruption, which can then be used as a reference layer. This was done, for example, in an analysis of the climate for the period from 535 to 550 AD, which was thought to be influenced by an otherwise unknown tropical eruption in about 533 AD; but which turned out to be caused by two eruptions, one in 535 or early 536 AD, and a second one in 539 or 540 AD. There are also more ancient reference points, such as the eruption of Toba about 72,000 years ago.

Many other elements and molecules have been detected in ice cores. In 1969, it was discovered that lead levels in Greenland ice had increased by a factor of over 200 since pre-industrial times, and increases in other elements produced by industrial processes, such as copper, cadmium, and zinc, have also been recorded. The presence of nitric and sulfuric acid ( and ) in precipitation can be shown to correlate with increasing fuel combustion over time. Methanesulfonate (MSA) () is produced in the atmosphere by marine organisms, so ice core records of MSA provide information on the history of the oceanic environment. Both hydrogen peroxide () and formaldehyde () have been studied, along with organic molecules such as carbon black that are linked to vegetation emissions and forest fires. Some species, such as calcium and ammonium, show strong seasonal variation. In some cases there are contributions from more than one source to a given species: for example, Ca++ comes from dust as well as from marine sources; the marine input is much greater than the dust input and so although the two sources peak at different times of the year, the overall signal shows a peak in the winter, when the marine input is at a maximum. Seasonal signals can be erased at sites where the accumulation is low, by surface winds; in these cases it is not possible to date individual layers of ice between two reference layers.

Some of the deposited chemical species may interact with the ice, so what is detected in an ice core is not necessarily what was originally deposited. Examples include HCHO and . Another complication is that in areas with low accumulation rates, deposition from fog can increase the concentration in the snow, sometimes to the point where the atmospheric concentration could be overestimated by a factor of two.
=== Radionuclides ===
Galactic cosmic rays produce in the atmosphere at a rate that depends on the solar magnetic field. The strength of the field is related to the intensity of solar radiation, so the level of in the atmosphere is a proxy for climate. Accelerator mass spectrometry can detect the low levels of in ice cores, about 10,000 atoms in a gram of ice, and these can be used to provide long-term records of solar activity. Tritium (), created by nuclear weapons testing in the 1950s and 1960s, has been identified in ice cores, and both 36Cl and have been found in ice cores in Antarctica and Greenland. Chlorine-36, which has a half-life of 301,000 years, has been used to date cores, as have krypton (, with a half-life of 11 years), lead (, 22 years), and silicon (, 172 years).

=== Other inclusions ===
Meteorites and micrometeorites that land on polar ice are sometimes concentrated by local environmental processes. For example, there are places in Antarctica where winds evaporate surface ice, concentrating the solids that are left behind, including meteorites. Meltwater ponds can also contain meteorites. At the South Pole Station, ice in a well is melted to provide a water supply, leaving micrometeorites behind. These have been collected by a robotic &quot;vacuum cleaner&quot; and examined, leading to improved estimates of their flux and mass distribution. The well is not an ice core, but the age of the ice that was melted is known, so the age of the recovered particles can be determined. The well becomes about 10 m deeper each year, so micrometeorites collected in a given year are about 100 years older than those from the previous year. Pollen, an important component of sediment cores, can also be found in ice cores. It provides information on changes in vegetation.

=== Physical properties ===
In addition to the impurities in a core and the isotopic composition of the water, the physical properties of the ice are examined. Features such as crystal size and axis orientation can reveal the history of ice flow patterns in the ice sheet. The crystal size can also be used to determine dates, though only in shallow cores.

== History ==
=== Early years ===
In 1841 and 1842, Louis Agassiz drilled holes in the Unteraargletscher in the Alps; these were drilled with iron rods and did not produce cores. The deepest hole achieved was 60 m. On Erich von Drygalski&#x27;s Antarctic expedition in 1902 and 1903, 30 m holes were drilled in an iceberg south of the Kerguelen Islands and temperature readings were taken. The first scientist to create a snow sampling tool was James E. Church, described by Pavel Talalay as &quot;the father of modern snow surveying&quot;. In the winter of 1908–1909, Church constructed steel tubes with slots and cutting heads to retrieve cores of snow up to 3 m long. Similar devices are in use today, modified to allow sampling to a depth of about 9 m. They are simply pushed into the snow and rotated by hand.

The first systematic study of snow and firn layers was by Ernst Sorge, who was part of the Alfred Wegener Expedition to central Greenland in 1930–1931. Sorge dug a 15 m pit to examine the snow layers, and his results were later formalized into Sorge&#x27;s Law of Densification by Henri Bader, who went on to do additional coring work in northwest Greenland in 1933. In the early 1950s, a SIPRE expedition took pit samples over much of the Greenland ice sheet, obtaining early oxygen isotope ratio data. Three other expeditions in the 1950s began ice coring work: a joint Norwegian-British-Swedish Antarctic Expedition (NBSAE), in Queen Maud Land in Antarctica; the Juneau Ice Field Research Project (JIRP), in Alaska; and Expéditions Polaires Françaises, in central Greenland. Core quality was poor, but some scientific work was done on the retrieved ice.

The International Geophysical Year (1957–1958) saw increased glaciology research around the world, with one of the high priority research targets being deep cores in polar regions. SIPRE conducted pilot drilling trials in 1956 (to 305 m) and 1957 (to 411 m) at Site 2 in Greenland; the second core, with the benefit of the previous year&#x27;s drilling experience, was retrieved in much better condition, with fewer gaps. In Antarctica, a 307 m core was drilled at Byrd Station in 1957–1958, and a 264 m core at Little America V, on the Ross Ice Shelf, the following year. The success of the IGY core drilling led to increased interest in improving ice coring capabilities, and was followed by a CRREL project at Camp Century, where in the early 1960s three holes were drilled, the deepest reaching the base of the ice sheet at 1387 m in July 1966. The drill used at Camp Century then went to Byrd Station, where a 2164 m hole was drilled to bedrock before the drill was frozen into the borehole by sub-ice meltwater and had to be abandoned.

French, Australian and Canadian projects from the 1960s and 1970s include a 905 m core at Dome C in Antarctica, drilled by CNRS; cores at Law Dome drilled by ANARE, starting in 1969 with a 382 m core; and Devon Ice Cap cores recovered by a Canadian team in the 1970s.

=== Antarctica deep cores ===
Soviet ice drilling projects began in the 1950s, in Franz Josef Land, the Urals, Novaya Zemlya, and at Mirny and Vostok in the Antarctic; not all these early holes retrieved cores. Over the following decades work continued at multiple locations in Asia. Drilling in the Antarctic focused mostly on Mirny and Vostok, with a series of deep holes at Vostok begun in 1970. The first deep hole at Vostok reached 506.9 m in April 1970; by 1973 a depth of 952 m had been reached. A subsequent hole, Vostok 2, drilled from 1971 to 1976, reached 450 m, and Vostok 3 reached 2202 m in 1985 after six drilling seasons. Vostok 3 was the first core to retrieve ice from the previous glacial period, 150,000 years ago. Drilling was interrupted by a fire at the camp in 1982, but further drilling began in 1984, eventually reaching 2546 m in 1989. A fifth Vostok core was begun in 1990, reached 3661 m in 2007, and was later extended to 3769 m. The estimated age of the ice is 420,000 years at 3310 m depth; below that point it is difficult to interpret the data reliably because of mixing of the ice.

EPICA, a European ice coring collaboration, was formed in the 1990s, and two holes were drilled in East Antarctica: one at Dome C, which reached 2871 m in only two seasons of drilling, but which took another four years to reach bedrock at 3260 m; and one at Kohnen Station, which reached bedrock at 2760 m in 2006. The Dome C core had very low accumulation rates, which mean that the climate record extended a long way; by the end of the project the usable data extended to 800,000 years ago.

Other deep Antarctic cores included a Japanese project at Dome F, which reached 2503 m in 1996, with an estimated age of 330,000 years for the bottom of the core; and a subsequent hole at the same site which reached 3035 m in 2006, estimated to reach ice 720,000 years old. US teams drilled at McMurdo Station in the 1990s, and at Taylor Dome (554 m in 1994) and Siple Dome (1004 m in 1999), with both cores reaching ice from the last glacial period. The West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) project, completed in 2011, reached 3405 m; the site has high snow accumulation so the ice only extends back 62,000 years, but as a consequence, the core provides high resolution data for the period it covers. A 948 m core was drilled at Berkner Island by a project managed by the British Antarctic Survey from 2002 to 2005, extending into the last glacial period; and an Italian-managed ITASE project completed a 1620 m core at Talos Dome in 2007.

In 2016, cores were retrieved from the Allan Hills in Antarctica in an area where old ice lay near the surface. The cores were dated by potassium-argon dating; traditional ice core dating is not possible as not all layers were present. The oldest core was found to include ice from 2.7 million years ago—by far the oldest ice yet dated from a core.

=== Greenland deep cores ===
In 1970, scientific discussions began which resulted in the Greenland Ice Sheet Project (GISP), a multinational investigation into the Greenland ice sheet that lasted until 1981. Years of field work were required to determine the ideal location for a deep core; the field work included several intermediate-depth cores, at Dye 3 (372 m in 1971), Milcent (398 m in 1973) and Crete (405 m in 1974), among others. A location in north-central Greenland was selected as ideal, but financial constraints forced the group to drill at Dye 3 instead, beginning in 1979. The hole reached bedrock at 2037 m, in 1981. Two holes, 30 km apart, were eventually drilled at the north-central location in the early 1990s by two groups: GRIP, a European consortium, and GISP-2, a group of US universities. GRIP reached bedrock at 3029 m in 1992, and GISP-2 reached bedrock at 3053 m the following year. Both cores were limited to about 100,000 years of climatic information, and since this was thought to be connected to the topography of the rock underlying the ice sheet at the drill sites, a new site was selected 200 km north of GRIP, and a new project, NorthGRIP, was launched as an international consortium led by Denmark. Drilling began in 1996; the first hole had to be abandoned at 1400 m in 1997, and a new hole was begun in 1999, reaching 3085 m in 2003. The hole did not reach bedrock, but terminated at a subglacial river. The core provided climatic data back to 123,000 years ago, which covered part of the last interglacial period. The subsequent North Greenland Eemian (NEEM) project retrieved a 2537 m core in 2010 from a site further north, extending the climatic record to 128,500 years ago; NEEM was followed by EastGRIP, which began in 2015 in east Greenland and was planned to be completed in 2020.
In March 2020, the 2020 EGRIP field campaign was cancelled due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. EastGRIP reopened for field work in 2022, where the CryoEgg reached new depths in the ice, under pressures in excess of 200 bar and temperatures of around -30c.

=== Non-polar cores ===
Ice cores have been drilled at locations away from the poles, notably in the Himalayas and the Andes. Some of these cores reach back to the last glacial period, but they are more important as records of El Niño events and of monsoon seasons in south Asia. Cores have also been drilled on Mount Kilimanjaro, in the Alps, and in Indonesia, New Zealand, Iceland, Scandinavia, Canada, and the US.

== Future plans ==
IPICS (International Partnerships in Ice Core Sciences) has produced a series of white papers outlining future challenges and scientific goals for the ice core science community. These include plans to:
* Retrieve ice cores that reach back over 1.2 million years, in order to obtain multiple iterations of ice core record for the 40,000-year long climate cycles known to have operated at that time. Current cores reach back over 800,000 years, and show 100,000-year cycles.
* Improve ice core chronologies, including connecting chronologies of multiple cores.
* Identify additional proxies from ice cores, for example for sea ice, marine biological productivity, or forest fires.
* Drill additional cores to provide high-resolution data for the last 2,000 years, to use as input for detailed climate modelling.
* Identify an improved drilling fluid
* Improve the ability to handle brittle ice, both while drilling and in transport and storage
* Find a way to handle cores which have pressurised water at bedrock
* Come up with a standardised lightweight drill capable of drilling both wet and dry holes, and able to reach depths of up to 1000 m.
* Improve core handling to maximise the information that can be obtained from each core.

A warming climate is found to create glacial meltwater that washes away temporally ordered layers of trapped aerosols that researchers use as an historical record of environmental events. The Ice Memory Foundation plans to store additional ice cores in Antarctica in advance of this impending loss of data.

<text>The New York State Legislature consists of the two houses that act as the state legislature of the U.S. state of New York: the New York State Senate and the New York State Assembly. The Constitution of New York does not designate an official term for the two houses together; it says only that the state&#x27;s legislative power &quot;shall be vested in the senate and assembly&quot;. Session laws passed by the Legislature are published in the official &quot;Laws of New York&quot;. Permanent New York laws of a general nature are codified in the &quot;Consolidated Laws of New York&quot;. , the Democratic Party holds supermajorities in both houses of the New York State Legislature, which is the highest paid state legislature in the country.

Legislative elections are held in November of every even-numbered year. Both Assembly members and Senators serve two-year terms.

In order to be a member of either house, one must be a citizen of the United States, a resident of the state of New York for at least five years, and a resident of the district for at least one year prior to election.

The Assembly consists of 150 members; they are each chosen from a single-member district. The New York Constitution allows the number of Senate seats to vary; , the Senate had 63 seats.

==Leaders==
The Assembly is headed by the speaker, while the Senate is headed by the president, a post held &quot;ex officio&quot; by the State lieutenant governor. the lieutenant governor, as president of the Senate, has only a tie-breaking &quot;casting vote&quot;. More often, the Senate is presided over by the temporary president, or by a senator of the majority leader&#x27;s choosing.

The assembly speaker and Senate majority leader control the assignment of committees and leadership positions, along with control of the agenda in their chambers. The two are considered powerful statewide leaders and along with the governor of New York control most of the agenda of state business in New York.

==Drafting and research==
The Legislative Bill Drafting Commission (LBDC) aids in drafting legislation; advises as to the constitutionality, consistency or effect of proposed legislation; conducts research; and publishes and maintains the documents of the Legislature, such as the &quot;Laws of New York&quot;. The LBDC consists of two commissioners, the commissioner for administration and the commissioner for operations, each appointed jointly by the temporary president of the Senate and the speaker of the Assembly.

==Party control==
In the 2018 elections, Democrats won control of the State Senate and increased their majority in the State Assembly. At the beginning of the 2019–2020 legislative session, the Senate Democratic Conference held 39 of the chamber&#x27;s 63 seats and the Assembly Democratic Conference held 106 of the 150 seats in that chamber. The Senate Democratic Conference increased to 40 seats after Democratic senator Simcha Felder was re-accepted into the Conference.

==Constitutional powers==
The Legislature is empowered to make law, subject to the governor&#x27;s power to veto a bill. However, the veto may be overridden by the Legislature if there is a two-thirds vote in favor of overriding in each House. Furthermore, it has the power to propose New York Constitution amendments by a majority vote, and then another majority vote following an election. If so proposed, the amendment becomes valid if agreed to by the voters at a referendum.

==History==
The legislature originated in the revolutionary New York Provincial Congress, assembled by rebels when the New York General Assembly would not send delegates to the Continental Congress.

The New York State Legislature has had several corruption scandals during its existence. These include the Black Horse Cavalry and Canal Ring.

In the 1840s, New York launched the first great wave of civil procedure reform in the United States by enacting the Field Code. The Code inspired the enactment of similar codes in 26 other states, and gave birth to the term &quot;code pleading&quot; for the system of civil procedure it created.

The first African-American elected to the legislature was Edward A. Johnson, a Republican, in 1917. The first women elected to the legislature were Republican Ida Sammis and Democrat Mary Lilly, both in 1919. The first African-American woman elected to the legislature was Bessie A. Buchanan in 1955.

Five assemblymen were expelled in 1920 for belonging to the Socialist Party.

In 2008, when the U.S. Supreme Court reluctantly affirmed the constitutionality of a statute enacted by the New York legislature, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote in a concurring opinion: &quot;[A]s I recall my esteemed former colleague, Thurgood Marshall, remarking on numerous occasions: &#x27;The Constitution does not prohibit legislatures from enacting stupid laws.

There is said to be a compact to which members of the New York Legislature unofficially adhere a code of silence regarding behavior such as illicit extramarital affairs or other embarrassing behavior.

<text>Sidney H. Liebson (July 9, 1920 – February 7, 2017) received his Ph.D. from the University of Maryland in 1947. His thesis was on the discharge mechanism of Geiger–Müller counters. Liebson received a US Navy award for developing the first equipment used to identify enemy radar.

Liebson participated in atomic bomb testing in the Pacific, developing radiation detectors that were used to measure bomb characteristics. In a significant test, his detectors validated the feasibility of making the hydrogen bomb. At a time when electronics had not been able to make measurements with nanosecond accuracy, he developed several techniques to accomplish this accuracy for measuring organic fluorescence decay times and organic scintillation pulse widths by indirect means.

His 1947 invention of the use of halogen gas in Geiger–Müller tubes led to considerable benefits in reducing the voltage of operation and greatly extended the life of the tubes. All modern GM tubes use his halogen-based quench gas. This innovation occurred while he was working on his thesis.
Liebson died on February 7, 2017.

<doc id="426463" wikidata="Q380286" url="?curid=426463" title="Pavel Milyukov">
<text>Pavel Nikolayevich Milyukov (; 31 March 1943) was a Russian historian and liberal politician. Milyukov was the founder, leader, and the most prominent member of the Constitutional Democratic party (known as the &quot;Kadets&quot;). He changed his view on the monarchy between 1905 and 1917. In the Russian Provisional Government, he served as Foreign Minister, working to prevent Russia&#x27;s exit from the First World War.

== Pre-revolutionary career ==
Pavel was born in Moscow in the upper-class family of Nikolai Pavlovich Milyukov, a professor in architecture who taught at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture. Milyukov was a member of the House of Milukoff. Milyukov studied history and philology at the Moscow University, where he was influenced by Herbert Spencer, Auguste Comte, and Karl Marx. His teachers were Vasily Klyuchevsky and Paul Vinogradoff. In summer 1877 he briefly took part in Russo-Turkish War as a military logistic, but returned to the university. He was expelled for taking part in student riots, went to Italy, but was readmitted and allowed to take his degree. He specialized in the study of Russian history and in 1885 received the degree for work on the &quot;State Economics of Russia in the First Quarter of the 18th Century and the reforms of Peter the Great&quot;.
In 1890 he became a member of the Moscow Society of Russian History and Antiquities. He gave private lectures with great success at a training institute for girl teachers and in 1895 was appointed to the university. These lectures were afterward expanded by him in his book &quot;Outlines of Russian Culture&quot; (3 vols., 1896–1903, translated into several languages). He started an association for &quot;home university reading,&quot; and, as its first president, edited the first volume of its program, which was widely read in Russian intellectual circles. As a student Milyukov was influenced by the liberal ideas of Konstantin Kavelin and Boris Chicherin. His liberal opinions brought him into conflict with the educational authorities, and he was dismissed in 1894 after one of the ever-recurrent university &quot;riots&quot;. He was imprisoned for two years in Riazan as a political agitator, but contributed as an archaeologist.

When released from jail, Milyukov went to Bulgaria, and was appointed professor in the University of Sofia, where he lectured in Bulgarian in the philosophy of history, etc. He was sent (or dismissed under Russian pressure) to Macedonia, part of the Ottoman Empire. There he worked in an archaeological site. In 1899 he was allowed to return to St Petersburg. In 1901 he was arrested again for taking part in a commemoration of the populist writer Pyotr Lavrov. (The last volume of &quot;Outlines of Russian Culture&quot; was actually finished in jail, where he spent six months for his political speech.) In 1901, according to Milyukov, about 16,000 people were exiled from the capital. The following by-law, published in 1902 by the governor of Bessarabia, is typical:

He contributed under a pseudonym to the clandestine journal &quot;Liberation&quot;, founded by Peter Berngardovich Struve, published in Stuttgart in 1902. The government again gave him the choice of exile for three years or jail for six months, Milyukov chose the Kresty Prison. After an interview with Vyacheslav von Plehve, whom he regarded as &quot;the symbol of the Russia he hated&quot;, Milyukov was released. He was central in the founding of the Union of Unions in 1905.

In 1903 he delivered courses of lectures in the United States  at summer sessions in University of Chicago and for the Lowell Institute lectures in Boston. He visited London and attended the Paris Conference 1904, organized by the Finnish dissident Konni Zilliacus. Milyukov returned to Russia during the Russian Revolution of 1905, according to Orlando Figes in many ways a foretaste of the conflicts of 1917. He founded the Constitutional Democratic party, a party of professors, academics, lawyers, writers, journalists, teachers, doctors, officials, and liberal zemstvo men. As a journalist for &quot;Svobodny narod&quot; (&quot;Free People&quot;) and &quot;Narodnaya swoboda&quot; (&quot;People&#x27;s Freedom&quot;) or as a former political prisoner Milyukov was not allowed to represent the Kadets in the first and second Duma. For Milyukov any agreement between liberalism and autocracy was impossible. In 1906 the Duma was dissolved and its members moved to Vyborg in Finland. Milyukov drafted the Vyborg Manifesto, calling for political freedom, reforms, and passive resistance to the governmental policy.

Dmitri Trepov suggested Ivan Goremykin ought to step down and promote a cabinet with only Kadets, which in his opinion would soon enter into a violent conflict with the Tsar and fail. He secretly met with Milyukov. Trepov opposed Pyotr Stolypin, who promoted a coalition cabinet.

The Kadets gave up the idea of founding a republic and began promoting a constitutional monarchy. Georgy Lvov and Alexander Guchkov tried to convince the tsar to accept liberals in the new government. In 1907 Milyukov was elected in the Third Duma; at some time he joined the board of the party Rech (newspaper). He was one of the few publicists in Russia, who had considerable knowledge of international politics, and his articles on the Near East seem to be of considerable interest.

== Deputy ==
In January 1908 Milyukov addressed &quot;The Civic Forum&quot; in Carnegie Hall. From the very beginning, the slogan and the idea of the empire ruled by Russians were very controversial regarding what &quot;Russians&quot; meant. One of the outspoken critics of the notion, Pavel Milyukov, considered the &quot;Russia for Russians&quot; slogan to have been &quot;a slogan of disunity... [and] not creative but destructive.&quot; In 1909, Milyukov addressed the Russian State Duma on the issue of using Ukrainian in the court system, attacking Russian nationalist deputies: &quot;You say &quot;Russia for Russians,&quot; but whom do you mean by &quot;Russian&quot;? You should say &quot;Russia only for the Great Russians,&quot; because that which you do not give to Muslims and Jews you also do not give your own nearest kin – Ukraine.&quot;

In 1912 he was reelected in the Fourth Duma. According to Milyukov, in May 1914 Rasputin had become an influential factor in Russian politics. With the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Milyukov swung to the right, but a coup to remove the Tsar belonged to the possibilities. He had become a nationalist, patriotic policy of national defense, relying on social chauvinism. (He was best friends with Sergei Sazonov.) Milyukov insisted his younger son volunteer for the army (who subsequently died in battle). In August 1915 he formed the Progressive Bloc and became the leader. Milyukov was regarded as a staunch supporter of the conquest of Constantinople. In the nineties, Milyukov thoroughly studied the Balkans, which made him the most competent authority on Balkan politics. His opponents mockingly called him &quot;Milyukov of Dardanelles&quot;. In Summer 1916, at the request of Rodzianko, Protopopov led a delegation of Duma members (with Milyukov) to strengthen the ties with Russia&#x27;s western allies in World War I: the Entente powers. In August he gave lectures in Oxford. On 1 November 1916, in a populist speech, he sharply criticized the Stürmer government for its inefficiency. He met professor Tomáš Masaryk in London, and consulted with him about the present state of the Czechoslovak Legion in Russia at that time.

=== &quot;Stupidity or treason&quot; speech ===
At Progressive Bloc meetings near the end of October, Progressives and left-Kadets argued that the revolutionary public mood could no longer be ignored and that the Duma should attack the entire tsarist system or lose whatever influence it had. Nationalists feared that a concerted stand against the government would jeopardize the existence of the Duma and further inflame the revolutionary feelings. Miliukov argued for and secured a tenuous adherence to a middle-ground tactic, attacking Boris Stürmer and forcing his replacement.

According to Stockdale, he had trouble gaining the support of his own party; at the 22–24 October Kadet fall conference provincial delegates &quot;lashed out at Miliukov with unaccustomed ferocity. His travels abroad had made him poorly informed about the public mood, they charged; the patience of the people was exhausted.&quot; He responded with a plea to keep their ultimate goal in mind: It will be our task not to destroy the government, which would only aid anarchy, but to instill in it a completely different content, that is, to build a genuine constitutional order. That is why, in our struggle with the government, despite everything, we must retain a sense of proportion... To support anarchy in the name of the struggle with the government would be to risk all the political conquests we have made since 1905. The day before the opening of the Duma, the Progressist party pulled out of the bloc because they believed the situation called for more than a mere denunciation of Stürmer.

On 1 November (O.S.) the government under the pro-peace Boris Stürmer was attacked in the Imperial Duma, not gathering since February. Alexander Kerensky spoke first, called the ministers &quot;hired assassins&quot; and &quot;cowards&quot; and said they were &quot;guided by the contemptible Grishka [or Grigori] Rasputin!&quot; The acting president Rodzianko ordered him to leave, when calling for the overthrow of the government in wartime. Miliukov&#x27;s speech was more than three times longer than Kerensky&#x27;s, and delivered using much more moderate language.

In his speech &quot;Rasputin and Rasputuiza&quot; he spoke of &quot;treachery and betrayal, about the dark forces, fighting in favor of Germany&quot;. He highlighted numerous governmental failures, including the case Sukhomlinov, concluding that Stürmer&#x27;s policies placed in jeopardy the Triple Entente. After each accusation – many times without basis – he asked &quot;Is this stupidity or is it treason?&quot; and the listeners answered &quot;stupidity!&quot;, &quot;treason!&quot;, etc. (Milyukov stated that it did not matter &quot;Choose any ... as the consequences are the same.&quot;) Stürmer walked out, followed by all his ministers.

He began by outlining how public hope had been lost over the course of the war, saying: &quot;We have lost faith that the government can lead us to victory.&quot; He mentioned the rumours of treason and then proceeded to discuss some of the allegations: that Stürmer had freed Suchomlinov, that there was a great deal of pro-German propaganda, that he had been told that the enemy had access to Russian state secrets in his visits to allied countries and that Stürmer&#x27;s private secretary [Ivan Manuilov-Manasevich] had been arrested for taking German bribes but was released when he kicked back to Stürmer.

Milyukov was taken immediately by Sir George Buchanan to the British Embassy and lived there till the February Revolution; (according to Stockdale he went to the Crimea). It is not known what they discussed, but his speech was spread in flyers on the front and at the Hinterland. Stürmer and Protopopov asked in vain for the dissolution of the Duma. Tsarina Alexandra suggested to her husband to expel Alexander Guchkov, Prince Lvov, Milyukov and Alexei Polivanov to Siberia.

According to Melissa Kirschke Stockdale, it was a &quot;volatile combination of revolutionary passions, escalating apprehension, and the near breakdown of unity in the moderate camp that provided the impetus for the most notorious address in the history of the Duma ...&quot;. The speech was a milestone on the road to Rasputin&#x27;s murder and the February Revolution. Stockdale also points out that Miliukov admitted to some reservations about his evidence in his memoirs, where he observed that his listeners resolutely answered &quot;treason&quot; &quot;even in those aspects where I myself was not entirely sure.&quot;

Richard Abraham, in his biography of Kerensky, argues that the withdrawal of the Progressists was essentially a vote of no confidence in Miliukov and that he grasped at the idea of accusing Stürmer in an effort to preserve his own influence.

== February Revolution ==

During the February Revolution Milyukov hoped to retain the constitutional monarchy in Russia. He became a member of the Provisional Committee of the State Duma on 27 February 1917. Milyukov wanted the monarchy retained, albeit with Alexei as Tsar and the Grand Duke Michael acting as Regent. When Michael awoke on 2 March (O.S.), he discovered not only that his brother had abdicated in his favour, as Nicholas had not informed him previously, but also that a delegation from the Duma would visit him in a few hours. The meeting with Duma President Rodzianko, Prince Lvov, and other ministers, including Milyukov and Kerensky, lasted all morning. Since the masses would not tolerate a new Tsar and the Duma could not guarantee Michael&#x27;s safety, Michael decided to decline the throne. On 6 March 1917, David Lloyd George gave a cautious welcome to the suggestion of Milyukov that the toppled Tsar and his family could be given sanctuary in Britain, but Lloyd George would have preferred that they go to a neutral country.

Rodzianko succeeded in publishing an order for the immediate return of the soldiers to their barracks, subordinate to their officers. To them, Rodzianko was totally unacceptable as prime minister and Prince Lvov, less unpopular, became the leader of the new cabinet. In the first Provisional government Miliukov became Minister of Foreign Affairs, taking over the ministry from deputy minister Anatoly Neratov who had held the office temporarily.

Miliukov sent the British an official request for revolutionary Leon Trotsky to be released from Amherst Internment Camp in Nova Scotia, after the British had boarded a steamer in Halifax harbour to arrest Trotsky and other &quot;dangerous socialists&quot; who were en route to Russia from New York. Upon receiving Milykov&#x27;s request the British freed Trotsky, who then continued his journey to Russia and became a key planner and leader of the Bolshevik Revolution that overthrew the provisional government.

He staunchly opposed popular demands for peace at any cost and firmly clung to Russia&#x27;s wartime alliances. As the Britannica 2004 put it, &quot;he was too inflexible to succeed in practical politics&quot;. On 20 April 1917, the government sent a note to Britain and France (which became known as the Miliukov note) proclaiming that Russia would fulfill its obligation towards the Allies and wage the war as long as it was necessary. On the same day, &quot;thousands of armed workers and soldiers came out to demonstrate on the street of Petrograd. Many of them carried banners with slogans calling for the removal of the &quot;ten bourgeois ministers&#x27;, for an end to the war and for the appointment of a new revolutionary government. The next day the Miliukov Note was condemned by the ministers. This resolved the immediate crisis. On 29 April, the minister of war Alexander Guchkov resigned, and Milyukov&#x27;s resignation followed on 2 or 4 May. Milyukov was offered a post as Secretary of Education, but refused; he stayed on as the Kadet leader and began to flirt with counter-revolutionary ideas.

=== Kornilov Affair ===
In the mass discontent following the July Days, mainly about Ukrainian autonomy, the Russian populace grew highly skeptical of the Provisional Government&#x27;s abilities to alleviate the economic distress and social resentment among the lower classes; the word &#x27;provisional&#x27; did not command respect. The crowd tired of war and hunger demanded a &quot;peace without annexations or contributions&quot;. Milyukov described the situation in Russia in late July as, &quot;Chaos in the army, chaos in foreign policy, chaos in industry and chaos in the nationalist questions&quot;. Lavr Kornilov, appointed commander-in-chief of the Russian army in July 1917, considered the Petrograd Soviet responsible for the breakdown in the military in recent times, and believed that the Russian Provisional Government lacked the power and confidence to dissolve the Petrograd Soviet. Following several ambiguous correspondences between Kornilov and Alexander Kerensky, Kornilov commanded an assault on the Petrograd Soviet.

Because the Petrograd Soviet was able to quickly gather a powerful army of workers and soldiers in defense of the Revolution, Kornilov&#x27;s coup was an abysmal failure and he was placed under arrest. The Kornilov Affair resulted in significantly increased distrust among Russians towards the Provisional Government.

== Exile ==
On 26 October 1917, the party&#x27;s newspapers were shut down by the new Soviet Government.
On 25 November 1917 Milyukov was elected in the Russian Constituent Assembly, the first truly free election in Russian history. On 11 December the party was banned by the Soviets and went underground. Milyukov moved from Petrograd to the Don Host Oblast. There he became a member of the Don civil council. He advised Mikhail Alekseyev of the Volunteer Army. Milyukov and Struve defended a Great Russia as firmly as the most reactionary monarchist. In May 1918 he went to Kiev, where he negotiated with the German high command to act together against the Bolsheviks. For many members of the Cadet Party, this went too far: Milyukov was forced to resign the presidency of the KDP Central Committee.

Milyukov went to Turkey and from there to Western Europe, to get support from the allies of the White movement, involved in the Russian Civil War. In April 1921 he immigrated to France, where he remained active in politics and edited the Russian-language newspaper &quot;Poslednie novosti&quot; (&quot;Latest News)&quot; (1920–1940). In June 1921 he left the Constitutional Democrats, following a division in the party. Miliukov had called on exiles to abandon hopes in counterrevolution at home, and instead to place their hopes in the peasantry to rise up against the hated Bolshevik regime. The debate between Milyukov and Vasily Maklakov began with Maklakov&#x27;s criticism of the Constitutional Democratic Party. 

 Assassination attempt During a performance of the Berliner Philharmonie on 28 March 1922, his friend Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov, the father of the novelist Vladimir Nabokov, was killed while shielding Milyukov from attackers. In 1934, Milyukov was a witness at the Berne Trial.

Although he remained an opponent of the communist regime, Milyukov supported Stalin&#x27;s &quot;imperial&quot; foreign policy. On the Winter War he commented as follows: &quot;I feel pity for the Finns, but I am for the Vyborg guberniya&quot;. Already in 1933 he had stated in Prague that, in case of a war between Germany and the USSR, &quot;the emigration must be unconditionally on the side of the Homeland&quot;. He supported the Soviet Union in its war effort against Nazi Germany and refused all Nazi rapprochements. He sincerely rejoiced at the Soviet victory in Stalingrad.

 Death 

Milyukov died in 1943, in Aix-les-Bains, France. Sometime between 1945 and 1954 his body was reburied at Batignolles Cemetery, division 30, next to his wife, Anna Sergeievna.

<text>Federation Square (marketed and colloquially known as Fed Square) is a venue for arts, culture and public events on the edge of the Melbourne central business district. It covers an area of at the intersection of Flinders and Swanston Streets built above busy railway lines and across the road from Flinders Street station. It incorporates major cultural institutions such as the Ian Potter Centre, Australian Centre for the Moving Image (ACMI) and the Koorie Heritage Trust as well as cafes and bars in a series of buildings centred around a large paved square, and a glass walled atrium.

==History==

===Background===
Melbourne&#x27;s central city grid was originally designed without a central public square, long seen as a missing element. From the 1920s there were proposals to roof the railway yards on the southeast corner of Flinders and Swanston Streets for a public square, with more detailed proposals prepared in the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1960s, the Melbourne City Council decided that the best place for the City Square was the corner of Swanston and Collins Streets, opposite the town hall. The first temporary square opened in 1968, and a permanent version opened in 1981. It was however not considered a great success, and was redeveloped in the 1990s as a smaller, simpler space in front of a new large hotel.

Meanwhile, in the late 1960s, a small part of the railway lines had been partly roofed by the construction of the Princes Gate Towers, colloquially known as the &quot;Gas &amp; Fuel Buildings&quot; after their major tenant, the Gas and Fuel Corporation, over the old Princes Bridge station. This included a plaza on the corner, which was elevated above the street and little used. Between the plaza and Batman Avenue, which ran along the north bank of the Yarra River, were the extensive Jolimont Railway Yards, and the through train lines running into Flinders Street station under Swanston Street.

In 1978 the idea of roofing the railyards was again proposed as part of a State Government competition for a landmark, asking for “an idea, a word, image or plan” to put Melbourne on the map. It drew 2300 entries, but no winner was declared.

===Design competition and controversy===
In 1996 the Premier Jeff Kennett announced that the Gas &amp; Fuel Buildings would be demolished, and the railyards roofed, and a complex including arts facilities and a large public space would be built. It was to be named Federation Square, and opened in time to celebrate the centenary of Australia&#x27;s Federation in 2001, and would include performing arts facilities, a gallery, a cinemedia centre, the public space, a glazed wintergarden, and ancillary cafe and retail spaces. An architectural design competition was announced that received 177 entries from around the world. Five designs were shortlisted, which included entries from high-profile Melbourne architects Denton Corker Marshall and Ashton Raggatt McDougall, and lesser known Sydney architect Chris Elliott, and London based architects Jenny Lowe and Adrian Hawker. The jury was chaired by Professor Neville Quarry. The winner announced on 28 July 1997, a consortium led by Lab Architecture Studio directed by Donald Bates and Peter Davidson from London, with the Dutch landscape architects Karres en Brands, directed by Sylvia Karres and Bart Brands, teamed with local executive architects Bates Smart for the second stage.

The design, originally costed at between $110 and $128 million, was complex and irregular, with gently angled &#x27;cranked&#x27; geometries predominating in both the planning and the facade treatment of the various buildings and the wintergardens that surrounded and defined the open spaces. A series of &#x27;shards&#x27; provided vertical accents, while interconnected laneways and stairways and the wintergarden would connect Flinders Street to the Yarra River. The open square was arranged as a gently sloping amphitheatre, focussed on a large viewing screen for public events, with a secondary sloped plaza area on the main corner. The design was widely supported by the design community but was less popular with the public. The design was also soon criticised when it was realised that the western freestanding &#x27;shard&#x27; would block views of the south front of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral from Princes Bridge.

The mix of occupants and tenants were soon modified, with the cinemedia centre becoming the new body known as ACMI, offices for multicultural broadcaster SBS added, and the gallery space becoming the Australian art wing of the National Gallery of Victoria, which became the Ian Potter Centre. The performance arts space was dropped, the number of commercial tenancies increased, and the south end of the Atrium became an auditorium. A new substantially rearranged design incorporating the new program was revealed in late 1998.

===Construction===
After the 1999 State election, while construction was well underway, the incoming Bracks Government ordered a report by the University of Melbourne&#x27;s Professor Evan Walker into the &#x27;western shard&#x27; to be located on the corner of Flinders and Swanston Streets, which concluded in February 2000 that the &quot;heritage vista&quot; towards St Paul&#x27;s cathedral should be preserved, and the shard be no more than 8m in height.

Budgets on the project blew out significantly due to the initial cost being seriously underestimated, given the expense of covering the railyards, changes to the brief, the need to resolve construction methods for the angular design, and the long delays. Among measures taken to cut costs was concreting areas originally designed for paving.

The final cost of construction was approximately $467 million (over four times the original estimate), the main funding primarily from the state government, with $64 million from the City of Melbourne, some from the federal government, while private operators and sponsors paid for fitouts or naming rights.

The square was opened on 26 October 2002. Unlike many Australian landmarks, it was not opened by the reigning monarch, Elizabeth II, nor was she invited to its unveiling; she visited Federation Square in October 2011.

===Further expansion===
In 2006, Federation Wharf redeveloped the vaults under Princes Walk (a former roadway) into a large bar, with extensive outdoor areas on the Yarra riverbank, with elevator access to Federation Square.

Several proposals have been prepared for the area known as Federation Square East, the remaining area of railyards to the east. There have been proposals for office towers and, more recently, a combination of open space and a hotel, or another campus for the National Gallery of Victoria to house their contemporary art collection.

===Apple Store===
In December 2017, the Andrews government announced that one of the buildings of the square, the Birrarung Building, would be demolished to make way for a freestanding Apple Store, generating strong criticism over the commercial use of a cultural space. Opposition groups including Our City Our Square and the National Trust of Australia (Victoria) then nominated Fed Square to the Victorian Heritage Register, which resulted in an interim decision to list in October 2018. Apple cancelled the plans in April 2019 after the application to Heritage Victoria to demolish the Birrarung Building was denied, and after a hearing, the square was formally listed in August 2019.

=== Metro Entrance ===
With the construction of the upcoming Melbourne Metro Tunnel, an entrance to the underground Town Hall station from the corner of Federation Square was proposed, with a design released in December 2018 that would replace the corner Information Centre. After the heritage listing of the square, a permit was sought to demolish the building and the plaza around it, which was granted on the basis that the Information Centre was not the original design for the &#x27;Western Shard&#x27;, and it was demolished by January 2019, though without a final approved design for the new entrance.

=== Later Developments ===
In early 2022, following the decision to build a new National Gallery Victoria Contemporary behind the NGV, with a linear public space connection through to St Kilda Road, the State Government established the Melbourne Arts Precinct Corporation to manage the delivery of the new park, the management of Federation Square, and to better connect the various arts institutions in Southbank to each other and through to the CBD. 

In October 2023 the Age newspaper ran a series of articles on the square, providing a range of opinions on its strengths and weaknesses. The failure of many cafes and shops over the years was noted, as well as the rough surface affecting mobility, the lack of shade, and the lack of clear paths through the site, concluding that the square was still a &#x27;work in progress&#x27;.

==Location and layout==

Federation Square occupies roughly a whole urban block bounded by Swanston, Flinders, and Russell Streets and the Yarra River. The open public square is directly opposite Flinders Street station and St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. The layout of the precinct is designed to connect the historical central district of the city with the Yarra River and a new park Birrarung Marr.

==Design features==

===Square===
The complex of buildings forms a rough U-shape around the main open-air square, oriented to the west. The eastern end of the square is formed by the glazed walls of The Atrium. While bluestone is used for the majority of the paving in the Atrium and St Paul&#x27;s Court, matching footpaths elsewhere in central Melbourne, the main square is paved in 470,000 ochre-coloured sandstone blocks from Western Australia and invokes images of the outback. The paving is designed as a huge urban artwork, called &quot;Nearamnew&quot;, by Paul Carter and gently rises above street level, containing a number of textual pieces inlaid in its undulating surface.

There are a small number of landscaped sections in the square and plaza which are planted with Eucalyptus trees.

===Plaza and giant screen===

A key part of the plaza design is its large and fixed public television screen, which has been used to broadcast major sporting events such as the AFL Grand Final and the Australian Open every year. It is currently the biggest broadcasting screen in Australia.

===Buildings===

The architecture of the square is in the deconstructivist style, with both plan and elevations designed around slightly angular, &#x27;cranked&#x27; geometries, rather than tradition orthogonal grids. The built forms are mainly slightly bent north–south volumes, separated by glazed gaps, a reference to traditional Melbourne laneways, with vertical &#x27;shards&#x27;, attached or freestanding, containing discrete functions like the Visitor&#x27;s Centre, or lifts and stairs.

The larger built volumes are relatively simple reinforced concrete buildings with glass walls, but with a second outer skin of cladding carried on heavy steel framing, folded and stepped slightly to create angular undulating surfaces. The cladding is composed of 6 different materials, zinc, perforated zinc, glass, frosted glass, sandstone and no cladding, in a camouflage-like pattern, and created using pinwheel tiling. The &#x27;crossbar&#x27; is an east–west built from that runs through the long gallery building, and is clad in perforated black steel panels.

Some buildings are named. The building along Flinders Street that houses ACMI and SBS is named the Alfred Deakin Building, the building between the plaza space and the river is called the Birrarung Building, while the building that houses the NGV Australia is also called the Ian Potter Centre.

===Shards===

Three shards frame the square space. The eastern and southern shards are completely clad in metallic surfaces with angular slots, very similar in design to the Jewish Museum Berlin, while the western shard is clad in glass. Adjoined to the southern shard is a hotel which features the wrap around metallic screen and glass louvers.

===Laneways===
There are a number of unnamed laneways in the Federation Square complex which connect it to both Flinders Street and the Yarra River via stairways. The stairways between the Western Shard and nearby buildings are also paved in larger flat rectangle sandstone blocks.

===Riverfront===
The riverfront areas extend south to an elevated pedestrian promenade which was once part of Batman Avenue and is lined with tall established trees of both deciduous exotic species and Australian eucalpyts. More recently, the vaults adjacent to the Princes Bridge have been converted into Federation Wharf, a series of cafes and boat berths. Some of the areas between the stairs and lanes leading to the river are landscaped with shady tree ferns.

===Atrium===

The &quot;atrium&quot; is one of the major public spaces in the precinct. It is a laneway-like space, five stories high with glazed walls and roof. The exposed metal structure and glazing patterns follow the pinwheel tiling pattern used elsewhere in the precinct&#x27;s building facades.

===Labyrinth===
The &quot;labyrinth&quot; is a passive cooling system sandwiched above the railway lines and below the middle of the square. The concrete structure consists of 1.2 km of interlocking, honeycombed walls. It covers 1600 m2. The walls have a corrugated profile to maximize their surface area, and are spaced 60 cm apart.

During summer nights, cold air is pumped in the combed space, cooling down the concrete, while heat absorbed during the day is pumped out. The following day, cold air is pumped from the labyrinth out into the atrium through floor vents. This process can keep the atrium up to 12 °C cooler than outside. This is comparable to conventional air conditioning, but using one-tenth the energy and producing one-tenth the carbon dioxide.

During winter, the process is reversed, storing warm daytime air in the Labyrinth overnight, and pumping it back into the atrium during the day.

The system can also partly cool the ACMI building when the power is not required by the atrium.

===Flagpoles===
In the Federation Square complex, there are a number of flagpoles, most notably a group of four, three of which permanently fly the Australian, Aboriginal, and Torres Strait Islander flags. The fourth flagpole occasionally flies the flag of a foreign country to celebrate a national holiday of that country, for example an independence day. Prior to 2022 foreign countries&#x27; flags were usually flown on a group of eight flagpoles located next to a bus stop.

The following countries&#x27; flags have been raised at Federation Square and/or its surroundings at least once:

==Facilities and tenants==
In addition to a number of shops, bars, cafés and restaurants, Federation Square&#x27;s cultural facilities include:

===Melbourne Visitor Centre===

The Melbourne Visitor Centre was located underground, with its entrance at the main corner shard directly opposite Flinders Street Station and St Pauls Cathedral and its exit at the opposite shard. The Visitor Centre was intended to replace a facility which was previously located at the turn of the 19th-century town hall administration buildings on Swanston Street. The Visitors Centre was demolished in December 2018 to make way for an entrance to the rapid transit station to be built under the Swanston Street, and the visitors centre returned to the Town Hall.

===The Edge===

The Edge theatre is a 450-seat space designed to have views of the Yarra River and across to the spire of The Arts Centre. The theatre is lined in wood veneer in similar geometrical patterns to other interiors in the complex. The Edge was named &quot;The BMW Edge&quot; until May 2013, when a new sponsorship deal with Deakin University caused it to be renamed &quot;The Deakin Edge&quot; until 2021.

===Zinc===
Zinc is a function space underneath the gallery building, and opens onto the Yarra river bank. It was intended as an entirely commercial part of the development of Federation Square, and is used for wedding receptions, corporate events, launches, and the like.

===National Gallery of Victoria===

The Ian Potter Centre, also known as the NGVA, houses the Australian part of the art collection of the National Gallery of Victoria (NGV), in the building along the eastern side. (The St Kilda Rd building now houses that International works of the NGV, and is known as the NGVI). There are over 20,000 Australian artworks, including paintings, sculpture, photography, fashion and textiles, and the collection is the oldest and most well known in the country.

Well-known works at the Ian Potter Centre include Frederick McCubbin&#x27;s &quot;Pioneers&quot; (1904) and Tom Roberts&#x27; &quot;Shearing the Rams&quot; (1890). Also featured are works from Sidney Nolan, John Perceval, Margaret Preston and Fred Williams. Indigenous art includes works by William Barak and Emily Kngwarreye.

The National Gallery at Federation Square also features the NGV Kids Corner, which is an interactive education section aimed at small children and families, and the NGV Studio.

=== ACMI (Australian Centre for the Moving Image) ===
The Australian Centre for the Moving Image known as ACMI has two cinemas that are equipped to play every film, video and digital video format, with attention to high-quality acoustics. The screen gallery, built along the entire length of what was previously a train station platform, is a subterranean gallery for experimentation with the moving image. Video art, installations, interactives, sound art and net art are all regularly exhibited in this space. Additional venues within ACMI allow computer-based public education, and other interactive presentations.

In 2003, ACMI commissioned SelectParks to produce an interactive game-based, site-specific installation called AcmiPark, which replicated and abstracted the real-world architecture of Federation Square. It also houses highly innovative mechanisms for interactive, multi-player sound and musical composition.

===Transport Hotel Bar===
Transport hotel and bar is a three-level hotel complex adjacent to the southern shard on the south western corner of the square. 
It has a ground-floor public bar, restaurant and cocktail lounge on the rooftop.

===SBS Radio and Television offices===
The Melbourne offices of the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS), one of Australia&#x27;s two publicly funded national broadcasters, is in the Deakin Building on Flinders Street.

===Beer awards===
Federation Square has recently become home to several beer award shows, and tastings, including the Australian International Beer Awards trade and public shows, as well as other similar events such as showcases of local and other Australian breweries. These events have been held in the square&#x27;s outdoor area the Atrium and usually require an entry fee in exchange for a set number of tastings.

===Past tenants===
Past tenants have included:
* &quot;Champions&quot;, The Australian Racing Museum &amp; Hall of Fame — Relocated to Melbourne Cricket Ground. 
* National Design Centre — Relocated to National Gallery of Victoria

==Reception and recognition==

In 2009, Virtual Tourist awarded Federation Square with the title of the &#x27;World&#x27;s Fifth Ugliest Building&#x27;. Criticisms of it ranged from its damage to the heritage vista to its similarity to a bombed-out war-time bunker due to its &quot;army camouflage&quot; colours. A judge from Virtual Tourist justified Federation Square&#x27;s ranking on the ugly list claiming that: &quot;Frenzied and overly complicated, the chaotic feel of the complex is made worse by a web of unsightly wires from which overhead lights dangle.&quot; It continues to be a &#x27;pet hate&#x27; of Melburnians and was discussed on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Art Nation&quot;.

After its opening on 26 October 2002, Federation Square remained controversial among Melburnians due to its unpopular architecture, but also because of its successive cost blowouts and construction delays (as its name suggests, it was to have opened in time for the centenary of Australian Federation on 1 January 2001). The construction manager was Multiplex.

The designers of Federation Square did not get any work for six months after the completion of the A$450 million public space, but did receive hate-mail from people who disliked the design.

The &quot;Australian Financial Review&quot; later reported that some Melburnians have learned to love the building, citing the record number of people using and visiting it. In 2005 it was included on &quot;The Atlantic Cities&quot;&#x27; 2011 list of &quot;10 Great Central Plazas and Squares&quot;.

==Architecture and Urban Design Awards==

At the Victorian State Architecture Awards held in June 2003, Federation Square was awarded the prestigious Victorian Architecture Medal, the Melbourne Prize and the Joseph Reed Award for Urban Design by the Victorian Chapter of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects.

In November 2003, the project won the Walter Burley Griffin Award for Urban Design and the Interior Architecture Award for The Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia (Federation Square) at the National Awards of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects.

<doc id="426474" wikidata="Q82181" url="?curid=426474" title="East Lindsey">
<text>East Lindsey is a local government district in Lincolnshire, England. Its council is based in Horncastle and the largest town is Skegness. Other towns include Alford, Burgh le Marsh, Coningsby, Louth, Mablethorpe, Spilsby, Sutton on Sea, Wainfleet All Saints, Wragby and Woodhall Spa. The district also covers a large rural area, including many smaller settlements.

The district lies on the east coast, bordering the North Sea. The north-west of the district includes part of the Lincolnshire Wolds, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The neighbouring districts are Boston, North Kesteven, West Lindsey and North East Lincolnshire.

==History==
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering nine former districts which were all abolished at the same time:
*Alford Urban District
*Horncastle Rural District
*Horncastle Urban District
*Louth Municipal Borough
*Louth Rural District
*Mablethorpe and Sutton Urban District
*Skegness Urban District
*Spilsby Rural District
*Woodhall Spa Urban District
The new district was named East Lindsey, reflecting its position within Lindsey, one of the three historic Parts of Lincolnshire, which had been an administrative county between 1889 and 1974.

In 2020 the council agreed to share its management and other staff with neighbouring Boston Borough Council. South Holland District Council joined the partnership in 2021, which is now described as the &quot;South and East Lincolnshire Councils Partnership&quot;.

==Governance==
East Lindsey District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Lincolnshire County Council. The whole district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since the 2023 election, being run by a Conservative minority administration.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority before coming into its powers on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 2001 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election, the composition of the council was:

Of the independent councillors, 13 sit with the Green councillor as the &quot;East Lindsey Independent Group&quot;, one sits with the Liberal Democrat as the &quot;District Independent / Liberal Democrat&quot; group and the other two do not belong to a group. The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2015 the council has comprised 55 councillors representing 37 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

===Premises===
The council is based at The Hub on Mareham Road in Horncastle, which was completed in 2023 as a joint campus with Boston College. Prior to that the council had its headquarters at Tedder Hall in Manby, with additional offices at Skegness Town Hall.

==Geography==

East Lindsey has an area of 1,760 km2, making it the 13th largest district (and largest non-unitary district) in England.

It borders North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire to the North, the North Sea to the east, Boston to the south, and North Kesteven and West Lindsey, to the west. The boundary between the district and North Kesteven, and part of Boston borough, is the River Witham. The furthest west settlement in the district is Wragby, and the furthest south is Frith Bank, around three miles from Boston.

The Lincolnshire Wolds AONB run north–south through the central and northern reaches of the district. To the east along the North Sea coast lies the Lincolnshire Marsh, with the Fens to the south and south-west.

Along the boundary with West Lindsey to the west can be found the Lincolnshire Lime Woods.

East Lindsey has a greater land area than several English counties, in particular being larger than the two-tier counties of Worcestershire, East Sussex, Surrey, and Hertfordshire.

==Economy==
The economy in the district is divided between the coast and rural inland areas. The coastal towns of Mablethorpe and Skegness attract recreational and tourist traffic, and are characterised by a highly seasonal economy. The rural inland areas are dominated by agriculture.

==Transport==
East Lindsey is highly rural and contains no dual carriageways. The A158 runs east–west from Lincoln, entering the district at Wragby, passing Horncastle and near by Spilsby, before terminating in Skegness. The A16 runs from Boston to the south, through Spilsby and Louth, and then on to Grimsby.

The district&#x27;s only modern railway line is the Poacher Line in the south of the district, which connects Skegness to Nottingham via Boston and Grantham.

Historically the area was served by the East Lincolnshire Railway, which connected Boston to Grimsby via Alford and Louth. There were also spurs and branch lines, which included the Mablethorpe loop railway, Horncastle Railway and Spilsby branch. These connected small towns with the mainline and all closed between 1950 and 1970, with only the spur at Louth to Grimsby surviving until 1981. A section of the former East Lincolnshire Railway north of Louth has been restored as a heritage railway called the Lincolnshire Wolds Railway, centred on Ludborough station.

==Media==
In terms of television, East Lindsey is served by BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire and ITV Yorkshire broadcasting from the Belmont transmitter.

Radio stations for the area are BBC Radio Lincolnshire, Lincs FM, Greatest Hits Radio Lincolnshire, and community based stations: County Linx Radio and Endeavour FM.

&quot;Lincolnshire Echo&quot; is the local newspaper.

==Towns and parishes==
The whole district is divided into civil parishes. The parish councils for Alford, Burgh le Marsh, Carrington and New Bolingbroke, Coningsby, Horncastle, Louth, Mablethorpe and Sutton, Skegness, Spilsby and Wainfleet All Saints have declared their parishes to be towns, allowing them to take the style &quot;town council&quot;. Many of the smaller parishes have a parish meeting rather than a parish council.

<text>West Lindsey is a local government district in Lincolnshire, England. Its council is based in Gainsborough, the district&#x27;s largest town. The district also includes the towns of Caistor and Market Rasen, along with numerous villages and surrounding rural areas. The east of the district includes part of the Lincolnshire Wolds, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

The neighbouring districts are North Lincolnshire, North East Lincolnshire, East Lindsey, North Kesteven, Lincoln, Newark and Sherwood and Bassetlaw.

==History==
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering five former districts which were all abolished at the same time:
*Caistor Rural District
*Gainsborough Rural District
*Gainsborough Urban District
*Market Rasen Urban District
*Welton Rural District

The new district was named West Lindsey, reflecting its position within Lindsey, one of the three historic Parts of Lincolnshire, which had been an administrative county between 1889 and 1974.

==Governance==
West Lindsey District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Lincolnshire County Council. The whole district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since 2021. Following the 2023 election the Liberal Democrats had exactly half the seats on the council, and managed to form an administration with the support of one of the independent councillors.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements took effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 2010 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election and subsequent changes of allegiance up to May 2024, the composition of the council was:

One of the independent councillors sits with the Liberal Democrats as the &quot;Liberal Democrat Administration Group&quot;, which forms the council&#x27;s administration. Another independent councillor sits with the Conservatives as the &quot;Opposition Group&quot;. The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2015 the council has comprised 36 councillors representing 20 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

In the 2016 EU referendum, West Lindsey voted 61.8% leave (33,847 votes) to 38.2% remain (20,906 votes).

===Premises===

The council is based at the Guildhall in Marshall&#x27;s Yard in Gainsborough, which is a modern office building within a retail development. The council moved there in 2008 from its former headquarters, also called the Guildhall, on Caskgate Street in Gainsborough. The old Guildhall had been built in 1966 for the former Gainsborough Urban District Council, one of the council&#x27;s predecessors. It has since been demolished.

==Geography==
West Lindsey borders North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire to the north, East Lindsey to the east, North Kesteven and the city of Lincoln to the south, and the county of Nottinghamshire to the west.

The boundary of the district in the west borders the River Trent, and meets Nottinghamshire (Bassetlaw) and North Lincolnshire at East Stockwith, close to Wildsworth. On the other side of the Trent is Gunthorpe, Lincolnshire. It deviates from the Trent, to the east along the River Eau at Scotter, where it meets Messingham in North Lincolnshire. The boundary deviates southwards near Scotton, then at Northorpe follows the B1205 eastwards, crossing the A15 at Waddingham. It follows the Sallowrow Drain to the Old River Ancholme at South Kelsey, which it follows northwards. At North Kelsey, it deviates from the Old River Ancholme, following the North Kelsey Beck eastwards. This crosses the B1434 then the Newark-Grimsby railway line, where at Searby cum Owmby it follows a drain parallel to the railway line northwards, and at Bigby it follows Kettleby Beck westwards across the railway line back to the Old River Ancholme, which it follows for almost a mile towards Brigg. The Bigby parish is the northern part of West Lindsey that skirts the southern edge of Brigg, crossing the A1084 and the railway line.

Also in Bigby, it crosses the Scunthorpe-Grimsby line, then three railway lines together at Wrawby Junction. North of Bigby village it crosses the western escarpment of the northern Lincolnshire Wolds, then skirts the southern and eastern perimeter of Humberside Airport. It crosses the A18 and B1210, then the B1211. The furthest north section of the district, and of the county, is where it meets a short section of the A180, where a few hundred metres west of the A160 interchange it meets North East Lincolnshire. It follows the New Beck Drain south-east across the B1210, and at Riby, the A1173 and A18. At Swallow it crosses the A46. It follows the Waithe Beck at Thorganby. At Swinhope it meets East Lindsey, next to Scallows Hall (in East Lindsey), and crosses the B1203, then again at Kirmond le Mire. It meets the B1225 &quot;High Street&quot; at Tealby, and for around two miles southwards is the district boundary, crossing the A631 at North Willingham. At Sixhills it deviates westwards from the B1225, next to the former RAF Ludford Magna (in East Lindsey). At Holton cum Beckering it crosses the B1202, then the A158 at Goltho, where it skirts the western edge of Wragby (in East Lindsey). It passes southwards in Bardney through Chamber&#x27;s Farm Wood (mostly in East Lindsey); Chamber&#x27;s Farm itself is in West Lindsey. It skirts the southern edge of the former RAF Bardney, and crosses the B1190 near Tupholme Abbey (in East Lindsey). East of Southrey (also in Bardney parish) it meets the River Witham and North Kesteven. It follows the River Witham westwards until Greetwell where it meets the City of Lincoln, deviates northwards, crossing the Lincoln - Market Rasen railway line. It follows the outskirts of Lincoln, crossing the B1182 (former A46) at Nettleham. It crosses the A15 north of the Riseholme roundabout, and follows a short section of the A57, then crosses it, near Bishop Bridge. A few hundred metres west it meets the Foss Dyke, which from there a mile north-west is the boundary with North Kesteven. At Saxilby with Ingleby it deviates westwards from the Foss Dyke, and at Broadholme (former Nottinghamshire until 1989) at the B1190 (&quot;Tom Otters Lane&quot;), it meets Nottinghamshire (Newark and Sherwood). It follows a half-mile section of Ox Pasture Drain north to the A57, which it briefly follows westwards until Kettlethorpe (A156 junction). It crosses the A1133 at Newton on Trent, and under a mile westwards it meets the River Trent and Bassetlaw, a mile north of the former High Marnham Power Station.

===Towns and parishes===

It covers Gainsborough, Market Rasen, Sudbrooke, Fiskerton, Reepham, Cherry Willingham, Nettleham, Welton, Caistor, and Keelby.

The whole district is divided into civil parishes. The parish councils for Caistor, Market Rasen and Gainsborough have declared their parishes to be towns, allowing them to take the style &quot;town council&quot;. Many of the smaller parishes have a parish meeting rather than a parish council.

==Education==
The district, similar to North and South Kesteven, has a mixture of comprehensive schools in the south-east of the district and selective schools in Gainsborough (Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s High School, The Gainsborough Academy) and Caistor. Both grammar schools are in the top ten for A level results in the East Midlands, with Caistor Grammar School getting the best results in this region consistently year on year. It also gets some of the best results in England. These schools offer a standard of state education from ages 11–16 not available in the regions of Lincolnshire directly north of the district (former Lindsey before 1974). Pupils from outside of the district may travel to be educated in Gainsborough from Scunthorpe (12–15 miles via the A159), and (in greater number) to Caistor from Grimsby and Cleethorpes (10–12 miles via the A46). The situation is reversed in the sixth form, with Lincolnshire pupils studying at the John Leggott College in Scunthorpe and the Franklin College, Grimsby. The best comprehensive in this district (and the county) is the William Farr School in Welton, which gets A level results similar to a grammar school.

==Transport==
Large parts of the district can be accessed from the M180, to the north of the region. The A1500 (&quot;Tillbridge Lane&quot;) and A631 are the main east–west routes, and avoid busy town centres. The A631, further west, allows passage (through Bassetlaw) to Doncaster Sheffield Airport in the nearby Metropolitan Borough of Doncaster. The north–south route is the A15, officially the straightest road in the UK, following the Roman road Ermine Street.

==Media==
In terms of television, West Lindsey is served by BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire and ITV Yorkshire (East) broadcasting from the Belmont transmitter which situated near Market Rasen. However, western parts of the district such as Gainsborough can also receive BBC Yorkshire and ITV Yorkshire (West) from the Emley Moor TV transmitter near Huddersfield in West Yorkshire.
Radio stations for the area are: 
*BBC Radio Lincolnshire
*Hits Radio Lincolnshire
*Greatest Hits Radio Lincolnshire 
*Trentside Radio (serving Gainsborough)

The &quot;Lincolnshire Echo&quot; is the regional newspaper covering West Lindsey. Publications with a focus on a particular area within the district include the &quot;Gainsborough Standard&quot; and the &quot;Market Rasen Mail&quot;.

==Tourism==
Attractions to the district include the Lincolnshire Wolds. The Lincolnshire Show is held in the district at the Lincolnshire Showground, south of the former RAF Scampton, which was previously the home for the Red Arrows, the Royal Air Force Aerobatic Team.

==Demographics==
The district has seen steady population growth since 2001, with Gainsborough and the villages north of Lincoln particular points of growth. The population of the district now stands at 95,200 as of 2021.

The district ranked 161 out of 326 local authorities for amounts of deprivation. Part of the Gainsborough South West ward is in the top 5% for deprived areas (Super Output Area) in the country. Gainsborough East and Gainsborough South West wards have the highest levels of unemployment, although the region as a whole has a below-average rate.

16% of employment is in manufacturing, and 6% in agriculture. There are around 3,220 businesses. There are few council houses and house prices are lower than the regional average.

<doc id="426477" wikidata="Q1942426" url="?curid=426477" title="South Kesteven">
<text>South Kesteven is a local government district in Lincolnshire, England, forming part of the traditional Kesteven division of the county. Its council is based in Grantham. The district also includes the towns of Bourne, Market Deeping and Stamford, along with numerous villages and surrounding rural areas.

South Kesteven borders North Kesteven to the north, South Holland to the east, the City of Peterborough and North Northamptonshire to the south, Rutland to the south-west, the Melton district of Leicestershire to the west, and the Newark and Sherwood district of Nottinghamshire to the north-west.

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. It covered the area of five former districts from the administrative county of Kesteven, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Bourne Urban District
*Grantham Municipal Borough
*South Kesteven Rural District
*Stamford Municipal Borough
*West Kesteven Rural District

The new district was named South Kesteven referencing its position within Kesteven, one of the three historic parts of Lincolnshire.

==Governance==
South Kesteven District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Lincolnshire County Council. All of the district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since the 2023 election, being run by a coalition of some of the independent councillors with the Greens, Liberal Democrats and Labour.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 2002 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election and subsequent by-elections and changes of allegiance up to July 2024, the composition of the council was:

Of the 25 independent councillors, eight form the &quot;Democratic Independent Group&quot;, eight form the &quot;Grantham Independent&quot; group, and five form the &quot;Independent&quot; group, which three groups all form part of the ruling coalition with the Greens and Liberal Democrats. Another three independents form the &quot;South Kesteven Independent Group&quot;, which sits with the Conservatives as the &quot;South Kesteven Coalition Group&quot; which forms the opposition. The remaining independent councillor (elected as a Conservative) does not belong to any group. The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2015 the council has comprised 56 councillors representing 30 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

===Premises===
The council is based at the Council Offices on St Peter&#x27;s Hill in Grantham. The building was purpose-built for the council and opened in 1987.

==Geography==

South Kesteven borders North Kesteven to the north, as far east as Horbling, where the A52 crosses the South Forty-Foot Drain. From there south it borders South Holland along the South Forty-Foot Drain, crossing the A151 just west of Guthram Gowt. The border follows the River Glen near to Tongue End where at Baston, the boundary crosses north–south over Baston and Langtoft fens. It crosses the A1175 at the B1525 junction (the end of the Deepings bypass), then meets the Welland about two miles west of Crowland at a point called Kennulph&#x27;s Stone. The parish of Deeping St. James is the south-east corner of the district, where the district borders the unitary authority of City of Peterborough. The boundary follows the Welland to Stamford, briefly following the B1443 (Barnack Road) where it skirts the edge of Burghley Park.

At the point where the railway crosses under the A1, is the corner of two other districts – Rutland and North Northamptonshire. The boundary with Rutland follows the east side of the A1. Since 1991, none of the A1 bypass is in South Kesteven. The boundary meets that of Great Casterton, and briefly follows the B1081 Ermine Street at Toll Bar. The boundary then follows that of Rutland, crossing the East Coast Main Line at Braceborough and Wilsthorpe and again at Carlby. At Castle Bytham, the boundary follows the east side of the A1, and crosses the A1 at South Witham, where a little further west is a corner with the district of Melton. The boundary follows that of Leicestershire along the former Sewstern Lane, which is now the Viking Way where it crosses the eastern end of Saltby Airfield. The boundary deviates from the Viking Way at Woolsthorpe-by-Belvoir where it briefly follows the River Devon. It crosses the A52 and railway at Sedgebrook. This area is part of the Vale of Belvoir. The boundary then passes through the former RAF Bottesford, where just north it meets the district of Newark and Sherwood (Staunton) at Three Shire Oak. The boundary crosses the A1 at Shire Bridge. It follows Shire Dyke at Claypole, crossing the East Coast Main Line, then briefly follows the River Witham. The north-west corner of the district is on the River Witham at Claypole just south of Barnby in the Willows. Further east, a two-mile section of the A17 skirts the district, just east of Byards Leap.

A corner of the district is where it meets the former route of Ermine Street, and now the Viking Way. This is the point where it meets the corners of Cranwell and Byard&#x27;s Leap, and Temple Bruer with Temple High Grange in North Kesteven. The boundary follows the Viking Way for three miles south, crossing the A17. It follows the B6403 to just north of Ancaster. It skirts Ancaster then rejoins the B6403 south of Ancaster to a point just south of RAF Barkston Heath. It passes just east of Oasby, crosses the A52, passes east of Braceby and Sapperton and Pickworth, then north of Folkingham. North of Horbling it follows the A52 all the way to Donington High Bridge.

The district&#x27;s border with Northamptonshire is Britain&#x27;s smallest border at only 10 metres long. However, the boundary with Rutland was altered in April 1991.
==Towns and parishes==
 

All of the district is covered by civil parishes, the parish councils for Bourne, Grantham, Market Deeping and Stamford have declared their parishes to be towns, allowing them to take the style &quot;town council&quot;.

==Demographics==

There was a population of 124,745 in the district at the 2001 census; it is the second-largest district in Lincolnshire by population after East Lindsey. However, it has the most people in the county aged under 19 and 25–49. It has the most university-educated people in the county and the healthiest people. It has the most employed people in the county – 61,000. The median age of the district is 39.

The district is the second least deprived in Lincolnshire, after North Kesteven. 60% of the district live in the towns. Fifteen of the villages are classed as &quot;larger villages&quot; in the district&#x27;s local plan. In the 2001 census, the district had 58,033 dwellings. For Lower Level Super Output Areas (around 1,500 population), there are 18 in the top 10% least deprived in England; around 30,000 people.

==Economy==
Farming is the main rural industry. The National Transmission System passes north–south through the district just west of Bourne and the A15.

23% of occupations are in hotel and catering; 23% in public administration, education, and health; and 27% in construction and manufacturing. 18% of companies are in knowledge-based industries, fairly high for the nearby region, but lower than Peterborough or Rutland (both 20%); the UK average is 20%. Although the district has a lower job density (jobs per resident) than the UK average, the relatively low local unemployment rate means many residents work outside the district. This also means that unemployed residents would be better looking for employment outside the district.

Stamford has a presence in the publishing sector, specialising in domestic pets and aviation, helped by the proximity of EMAP in Orton, Peterborough. The largest employer in Bourne is the Bourne Prepared Produce site of Bakkavör, who prepare salads, and stir fry vegetables.

The district opened its first purpose-built business innovation centre, called &quot;Eventus&quot;, on the A1175 at Market Deeping in July 2010. This is to attract high-tech companies, which the district notably lacks (as does most of the county), and was funded by the district and county councils. The district has a stable economy. It lies in the Welland Sub Regional Strategic Partnership (Welland SSP), which covers the district apart from Grantham, and has been run by Welland Enterprise (owned by Norfolk and Waveney Enterprise Services) based at Stoke Rochford. Grantham is covered by Lincolnshire Enterprise. Outside of the main towns, commercial development has been allocated for Colsterworth and the Roseland Business Park at Long Bennington on part of the former RAF Bottesford.
The district forms the northern sector of the Peterborough Sub-Region (formed also with Rutland, South Holland, East Northamptonshire, Huntingdonshire and Fenland). Bourne, Stamford and Market Deeping are in Peterborough&#x27;s travel to work area (TTWA). North of there, Grantham is the next TTWA. The A15 corridor to Bourne is where most people in the district work in Peterborough. At the 2001 census it was found only 65% of workers work in the district, but 13% go to Peterborough, 3% to Rutland and 2% to North Kesteven. Around 21% of people working in the district live elsewhere – 3% from North Kesteven and Peterborough, and 2% from Rutland. Around 700 people in the district travel to work in London.

In 2011, South Kesteven District Council invested £60,000 to transform a patch of wasteland in Greyfriars into a revitalised play area for children. The initiative is now known as the Arnoldsfield Adventure Area.

===Visitor attractions===

The district has a 130-mile walk called the South Kesteven Round.
Other attractions be found in the towns of Bourne (Bourne Abbey), Grantham (St Wulfram&#x27;s Church), Market Deeping, Stamford (Churches, markets etc.) among other places..

==Transport==

The A1 passes through the district as does the East Coast Main Line. The A52 is a busy east–west route. The A15 is a quieter route and goes through the centre of many villages.

The Birmingham to Peterborough Line passes through Stamford, which is one of the few east–west routes.

The Skegness to Nottingham line (The Poacher Line) and the East Coast Main Line serve Grantham. This is another east–west route that also carries train services between Norwich and Liverpool.

==Media==
In terms of television, the area is served by BBC East Midlands and ITV Central broadcast from the Waltham TV transmitter. However, the Belmont transmitter is also received that broadcast BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire and ITV Yorkshire which also covers the area. With the co-channel interference from the Waltham transmitter, a small number of households in the southern tip of the district are able to receive BBC East and ITV Anglia.

Radio stations for the area are:
*BBC Radio Lincolnshire on 104.7 FM and 94.9 FM
*BBC Radio Cambridgeshire can also be received on 95.7 FM,
*Hits Radio Lincolnshire on DAB
*Greatest Hits Radio Lincolnshire on 96.7FM and 102.2 FM
*Greatest Hits Radio Stamford and Rutland (covering Stamford) on 97.4 FM
*Smooth East Midlands on 106.8 FM
*Heart East on 102.7 FM
*Gravity FM (for Grantham) on 97.2 FM

==Education==

The district has 51 primary schools and 10 state secondary schools. There are 8 independent schools.

===Training===
The district had one of two teacher training colleges in the county until 1978 when Kesteven College of Education at Stoke Rochford Hall closed. More recently the district had the Kesteven Agricultural College at Caythorpe Court, in the north of the district. It was taken over by the newly formed University of Lincoln, who closed it one year later in 2002.

Due to neighbouring Rutland not having a further education college, it relies on New College Stamford. Rutland also shares an Employment and Skills Board, Education Business Partnership, Connexions (agency), Aimhigher centre, and learndirect service (Lincolnshire &amp; Rutland Hub based at Lincoln College).

==Arms==
==2016 EU Referendum==

On Thursday 23 June 2016 South Kesteven voted in only the third major UK-wide referendum on the issue of the United Kingdom&#x27;s membership of the European Union in the 2016 EU Referendum under the provisions of the European Union Referendum Act 2015 where voters were asked to decide on the question &quot;Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?” by voting for either &quot;Remain a member of the European Union&quot; or &quot;Leave the European Union&quot;. The result saw a decisive vote to &quot;Leave the European Union&quot; by 60% of the electorate on a high turnout of 78%. The result went against the views of the local MP Nick Boles who was in favour of a &quot;Remain&quot; vote.

The result was declared at Meres Leisure Centre in Grantham early on Friday 24 June by the &quot;Counting officer&quot; (CO) Beverly Agass.

<doc id="426479" wikidata="Q1440873" url="?curid=426479" title="Showrunner">
<text>A showrunner is the top-level executive producer of a television series. The position outranks other creative and management personnel, including episode directors, in contrast to feature films, in which the director has creative control over the production, and the executive producer&#x27;s role is limited to investing. In scripted comedy and drama TV shows, the showrunner also usually serves as the head writer (or its most prolific writer). The role of a showrunner is not present on all television series, especially outside the US; this article describes the nature of the role where it is present.

==United States==
Writer Alex Epstein, in his book and blog &quot;Crafty Screenwriting&quot;, defines a showrunner as &quot;the person responsible for all creative aspects of the show and responsible only to the network (and production company, if it&#x27;s not [their] production company). The boss. Usually a writer. Traditionally, the executive producer of a television program was the &quot;chief executive&quot;, responsible for the show&#x27;s creative direction and production. Over time, the title of executive producer was applied to a wider range of roles—from a senior writer, to someone who arranges financing, to an &quot;angel&quot; who holds the title as an honorific with no management duties in return for providing backing capital. The term &quot;showrunner&quot; was created to identify the executive producer who holds ultimate management and creative authority for the program.&quot; The contract gained by the Writers Guild of America in the 2023 strike now explicitly defines &quot;showrunner&quot; as writers and people responsible for making hiring decisions regarding a project&#x27;s other staff writers.

In a January 1990 submission to the United States Congress House Committee on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Administration of Justice, Barney Rosenzweig (Executive Vice President and Chairman, Television Division of Weintraub Entertainment Group) wrote:

&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; columnist Scott Collins describes showrunners as:
In a 2011 article in &quot;The Australian&quot;, Shane Brennan, the showrunner for &quot;NCIS&quot; and &quot;&quot;, described the position thus:

In June 2023, Andy Greenwald of &quot;Briarpatch&quot; said of the title of showrunner, &quot;It&#x27;s a made-up title, and it&#x27;s not a paid position&quot;. Without an overall deal, he said, a showrunner could be paid less than a co-executive producer &quot;because everything else that I do — from hiring the writers, to being on set and producing, to being in post for months, then doing press — is not compensated&quot;. With the end of the streaming wars and Hollywood emphasizing profitability, overall deals became much rarer. Reduced compensation for showrunners and others in the writers&#x27; room helped cause the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike. In an interview that same month with &quot;Vox&quot;, writer Erica Saleh, who developed the series &quot;One of Us Is Lying&quot;, listed the function and structure of the personnel in WGA writers&#x27; rooms, explaining that showrunners determine the tone and genre of the show, and break down the structure of a season, its episodes, and storylines, prior to actual production of the program. Saleh listed the hierarchy of the staff on WGA shows, in order of authority:

==Canada==
The Writers Guild of Canada, the union representing screenwriters in Canada, established the Showrunner Award in 2007, at the annual Canadian Screenwriting Awards. The first Showrunner Award was presented in April 2007 to Brad Wright, executive producer of &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; and &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;.

==United Kingdom==
In the first decade of the 21st century, the concept of a &quot;showrunner&quot;, specifically interpreted as a writer or presenter with overall responsibility for a television production, began to spread to the British television industry. &quot;Nonetheless, the show runner production model is still less common in drama production in the UK&quot; than it is in the U.S., scholars Ruth McElroy and Caitriona Noonan wrote in 2019.

The first British comedy series to use the term was &quot;My Family&quot; (2000–11), which had several showrunners in succession. Initially, the show was overseen by creator Fred Barron from series 1–4. Ian Brown and James Hendrie took over for series 5, followed by American writer Tom Leopold for series 6. Former &quot;Cheers&quot; showrunner Tom Anderson was in charge from series 7 to the final series, series 11.

The first writer appointed the role of showrunner on a British primetime drama was Tony McHale, writer and creator of &quot;Holby City&quot;, in 2005. Jed Mercurio had carried out a similar role on the less conspicuous medical drama &quot;Bodies&quot; (2004–2006). But Russell T Davies&#x27; work on the 2005 revival of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; brought the term to prominence in British television (to the extent that in 2009 a writer for &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that &quot;Over here, the concept of &#x27;showrunner&#x27; has only made it as far as &quot;Doctor Who&quot;&quot;).

In an interview, Davies said that he felt the role of the showrunner was to establish and maintain a consistent tone in a drama. &quot;Doctor Who&quot; remains the most prominent example of a British television programme with a showrunner, with Steven Moffat having taken over the post from Davies from 2010 until 2017. Chris Chibnall later took over from Moffat. Davies returned, following Chibnall&#x27;s departure. The term has also been used to refer to other writer-producers, such as Cash Carraway on Rain Dogs, Tony Jordan on &quot;Moving Wallpaper&quot; and &quot;Echo Beach&quot;, Ann McManus on &quot;Waterloo Road&quot;, Adrian Hodges on &quot;Primeval&quot; and Jed Mercurio on &quot;Bodies&quot;, &quot;Line of Duty&quot;, and &quot;Critical&quot;.

<text>Bartholomäus (Barthel) Schink (; November 27, 1927 – November 10, 1944) was a member of the Edelweiss Pirates, active in the Ehrenfeld Group (Ehrenfeld is a district of Cologne) in Cologne, which resisted the Nazi regime. He was among the 13 members of that group who were publicly hanged in Cologne by the Gestapo on 10 November 1944. Although they were not tried, the group was accused of killing five people and planning an attack on the &quot;EL-DE Haus&quot;, the local Gestapo headquarters. 

The street in the Ehrenfeld suburb of Cologne, next to the Ehrenfeld railway station where Schink was hanged, is named after Schink. Yad Vashem recognized Barthel Schink as Righteous Among the Nations for risking his life to hide Jews from the Nazi persecution. There is a memorial plaque honoring the memory of all those killed from the Edelweiss Pirates and the Ehrenfeld Group.

<doc id="426484" wikidata="Q331942" url="?curid=426484" title="Vijay Singh">
<text>Vijay Singh ( ; born 22 February 1963) is a Fijian professional golfer. In 1982, Singh turned professional and played on the local Asia Golf Circuit. However, his early career met with controversy, as he was accused of numerous rules violations, and he was banned from the AGC. Singh turned to Africa and Europe where he had much success on the respective tours, the Safari Circuit and European Tour, winning several times on each. In 1993, he won the PGA Tour&#x27;s Buick Classic, earning him tour membership and ultimately Rookie of the Years honors. In 1998, he won his first major championship, the PGA Championship, and two years later the Masters. In 2004, Singh had one of the best seasons in the history of golf, winning nine times including the PGA Championship, overtaking Tiger Woods as the #1 golfer in the world.

==Early life==
Singh recollected to reporters about his childhood: &quot;When we were kids we couldn&#x27;t afford golf balls so we had to make do with coconuts. My father used to say, &#x27;Little Vijay, golf balls don&#x27;t fall off trees you know,&#x27; so I found some that did!&quot; Growing up, he played snooker, cricket, football, and the country&#x27;s most popular sport, rugby. He is the son of Mohan Singh, an airplane technician who also taught golf. Growing up, he admired the swing of Tom Weiskopf, using it as an early model for his own.

== Professional career ==

=== Asia Golf Circuit ===
Singh turned professional in 1982. Two years later, he won the 1984 Malaysian PGA Championship. However, his career was plunged into crisis after he was suspended from the Asia Golf Circuit in 1985 over allegations he doctored his scorecard. It was alleged that he lowered his score from one over to one under in order to make the cut, but Singh denies this, saying that in any case, it should only have resulted in disqualification from the event rather than a ban. After investigation by the Tour of this and other alleged violations proved true, John Bender, Asian PGA Tour president, issued Singh a lifetime ban on Asian PGA Tour play.

Singh felt he had been more harshly treated because the marker was &quot;the son of a VIP in the Indonesian PGA.&quot; He then took a job at the Keningau Club in Sabah, Malaysia, before his move to the Miri Golf Club in Sarawak. While this was a period of hardship for him, he continued to gain experience.

=== European Tour ===
Singh saved the money he needed to resurrect his career and began to re-enter tournaments. In 1988 he teamed up with a sponsor, Red Baron, which funded a trip to Africa to compete on the now-defunct Safari Circuit, an offshoot circuit of the European Tour. Singh captured his first event, the 1988 Nigerian Open, as locals cheered him loudly. At the end of that year he entered the European Tour Qualifying school for the second consecutive year, and was successful on this occasion.

In 1989, Singh won his first European Tour title at the Volvo Open Championship in Italy and finished 24th on the European Tour Order of Merit, putting his early struggles firmly behind him. He won four times in 1989, at the Volvo Open di Firenze, Ivory Coast Open, Nigerian Open and Zimbabwe Open. He also finished tied for 23rd at The Open Championship. He won on the European Tour again in 1990 and did so twice in 1992. He also won several tournaments in Asia and Africa in this period.

===PGA Tour===
Singh earned membership for the PGA Tour in 1993, winning his first tournament, the Buick Classic in a playoff over Mark Wiebe. That victory led to his being named the 1993 PGA Tour Rookie of the Year. After being hampered with back and neck problems in 1994, he came back to win the Buick Classic again in 1995 as well as the Phoenix Open. After playing well in 1996 (but with no victories), he won both the Memorial Tournament and the Buick Open in 1997.

In 1998, Singh was victorious at the PGA Championship at Sahalee Country Club in Sammamish, Washington, playing a 70-66-67-68 over the four days (the 66 tied a course record) and earning him his first Major title. He followed this up by winning The Masters in 2000, with a three-stroke victory over Ernie Els.

Singh did not win on the PGA Tour in 2001, but finished the year with a Tour-best 14 top-10 finishes and was fourth on the money list with $3,440,829 for the year. In 2002, he won at the Shell Houston Open at TPC at The Woodlands, setting a new tournament 72-hole scoring record with a 266, and at the Tour Championship, winning by two strokes over Charles Howell III.

2003 proved to be a very successful year for Singh. He won four tournaments, had 18 top-10 finishes and was the PGA Tour&#x27;s money leader (and had the second-highest single-season total in PGA Tour history) with $7,573,907, beating Tiger Woods by $900,494, though Singh played 27 tournaments compared to Woods&#x27; 18 tournaments. Singh also tied a 9-hole scoring record at the U.S. Open with a 29 on the back nine of his second round. His victories came at the Phoenix Open, the EDS Byron Nelson Championship, the John Deere Classic and the FUNAI Classic at the Walt Disney World Resort. He narrowly lost the vote for the PGA of America&#x27;s Player of the Year to Tiger Woods.

However, the 2003 season was also spotted with controversy involving Singh surrounding the year&#x27;s event at the Bank of America Colonial. LPGA star Annika Sörenstam became the first woman to play at a PGA Tour event since Babe Zaharias at the 1945 Los Angeles Open. Surrounding this fervor, Singh was misquoted as having said that Sörenstam &quot;didn&#x27;t belong&quot; on the men&#x27;s tour and that he would not play if he were paired with her. What he actually said is that he would not be paired with her because his playing partner was being selected from the past champion&#x27;s pool. Singh later clarified, &quot;There are guys out there trying to make a living. It&#x27;s not a ladies&#x27; tour. If she wants to play, she should—or any other woman for that matter—if they want to play the man&#x27;s tour, they should qualify and play like everybody else.&quot;

Singh began 2004 by winning the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am at −16 and winning $954,000 in prize money. This was his first win on tour in 2004 and his 16th all-time on the PGA Tour. It was his 12th consecutive top-10 finish, which is two shy of Jack Nicklaus&#x27; all-time record.

Singh won the final major of 2004, winning the PGA Championship, his third major, in a three-hole aggregate playoff over Justin Leonard and Chris DiMarco. Singh was the leader by one shot over Leonard going into the final round, but made no birdies in the final round, finishing regulation at 67-68-69-76=280. His final round of 76 was the highest winning score by a major champion since 1955. The playoff was a tense affair, and Singh&#x27;s birdie on the first playoff hole, his first birdie of the day, proved to be the difference.

On 6 September 2004 (Labor Day), Singh won the Deutsche Bank Championship in Norton, Massachusetts. With the win, he overtook Tiger Woods at the top of the Official World Golf Ranking, ending Woods&#x27; streak of 264 weeks at the top of the golf world.

Singh finished the 2004 season with a career-best nine victories, 18 top-10s, and a record $10,905,166 in earnings and was named the PGA Tour&#x27;s and PGA of America&#x27;s Player of the Year. The former award is decided by a vote of active PGA Tour players.

Despite picking up a win early in 2005, Singh lost his world number 1 ranking when Tiger Woods won the Ford Championship at Doral on 6 March, but just two weeks later he took it back again after notching up top-three finishes in three consecutive weeks. Following Woods&#x27; win at the 2005 Masters, Singh once again lost his place as World No. 1 in the Official World Golf Ranking and finished tied for fifth place. In April, he became the youngest living person elected to the World Golf Hall of Fame, garnering 56% of the ballot. Thirty-year-old Karrie Webb was inducted into the Hall of Fame in October 2005, but Singh remained the youngest living electee, as Webb qualified for the Hall without an election process. (The 19th century great Tom Morris, Jr., who was elected in 1975, died at age 24.) Singh deferred his induction for a year, and it took place in October 2006.

In 2006, Singh played enough European Tour events to be listed on the European Tour Order of Merit title for the first time since 1995.

At the start of the 2007 season, Singh won the Mercedes-Benz Championship which was the first FedEx Cup event in PGA Tour history. This win got Singh his 18th tour win over the age of 40, surpassing Sam Snead as most over 40 wins, and making all-time over 40 tour winner. He won again at The Arnold Palmer Invitational in March, but did not win for the rest of the year which turned into a disappointing year for Singh. He did not finish in a top ten of a major for the first time in ten years and finished 10th in the FedEx Cup race. He went through swing changes during the end of 2007 which resulted in weeks of missed cuts and staying outside the top ten through the Presidents Cup.

A new swing brought big changes for Singh in 2008, although he had good opportunities at Pebble Beach and Bay Hill, he was not competing at a high level for the first half of the year. His game was plagued by poor putting for the better part of two years, but his season started to turn around with a tie for fifth at the Travelers Championship. After missing the cut at The Open Championship, Singh won the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational in early August for his first win of the year and first World Golf Championship. His win had been a relief after missing short putts throughout the week. He missed the cut the following two weeks including at Oakland Hills for the PGA Championship and entered the PGA Tour FedEx Cup playoffs ranked 7th in the standings. At the first playoff event, Singh prevailed for his first FedEx Cup win defeating Sergio García and Kevin Sutherland in a playoff. On the first playoff hole García and Singh matched long birdie putts before Singh won with birdie on the second playoff hole. Singh was propelled into first place in the FedEx Cup race with three events remaining. At the second event of the playoffs, he triumphed once again, this time at the Deutsche Bank Championship bewildering the field with a five strokes victory and a final round 63. He had won three times in his last five starts and created an almost insurmountable lead in the points race. He would not contend in the remaining two events, but by playing in both the 2008 FedEx Cup title belonged to Singh. His season which looked to be a major disappointment in July turned into an historic year for Singh: he won the PGA Tour money list for the third time in his career and he surpassed Harry Cooper for most PGA Tour wins of all time for a non-American.

Singh has won 22 times on the PGA Tour since turning 40 – beating the record previously set by Sam Snead. He is the second man to reach $60 million in PGA Tour career earnings, after Tiger Woods. His 34 career victories are the most on the PGA Tour by a non-American player and place him 14th on the all-time list. He has spent over 540 weeks ranked in the top 10 of the Official World Golf Ranking. Singh&#x27;s longevity on the PGA Tour and his number of wins earn him a lifetime exemption on the PGA Tour.

Kenny Perry, another player who found success at a late age is good friends with Singh, who calls him &quot;Biggie&quot;. Of Singh, Perry said &quot;Vijay has always been good to me. We talk a lot. He wants to know how my family is doing. I think the world of him.&quot;

After the 2008 playoffs, Singh announced his withdrawal from a couple of Asian Tour events because of a nagging back injury and was advised by doctors to rest. He missed two and a half months, returning to win Tiger Woods&#x27;s tournament, the Chevron World Challenge at Sherwood Country Club in California in December. It was his first victory in the event. During the start of the 2009 season Singh announced that he would miss three weeks after undergoing arthroscopic surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his right knee. Singh had a mediocre 2009 season, with no top 5 finishes and ended the year with his lowest ever ranking on the PGA Tour money list in 68th.

His poor form continued into 2010, resulting in him being 66th on the PGA Tour money list. He dropped out of the top 50 in the world rankings for the first time since the early 1990s.

After returning from knee surgery, Singh started the 2011 season making five out of his first five cuts. In February, Singh was in contention to win his first PGA Tour Title since 2008 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open in Scottsdale, Arizona. Despite shooting a final round 66, Singh finished two shots behind Jason Dufner and eventual winner Mark Wilson. A couple of weeks later, Singh was in contention again, this time at the Northern Trust Open at Riviera Country Club. However, he came up short again, not helped by back-to-back bogeys on holes 12 and 13. He would eventually finish two shots back of the winner Aaron Baddeley, although he did secure second spot on his own. This early season form however was not enough to secure a spot at the opening World Golf Championship of the year, the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship the following week. However, at number 10 in the 2011 FedEx Cup standings, it was just enough to secure a spot at the WGC-Cadillac Championship in March.

On 6 June 2011, Singh missed his tee-time for the U.S. Open qualifying in Columbus, Ohio. At the time, this ended the longest active streak of consecutive majors played by a professional golfer, at 67.

On 30 January 2013, Singh admitted to using deer-antler spray while not knowing that it is a banned substance. The PGA Tour later dropped its case against him. On 8 May 2013, Singh sued the PGA Tour for exposing him to public humiliation and ridicule during a 12-week investigation into his use of deer-antler spray. On 20 November 2018, the PGA Tour and Singh announced that the lawsuit had been settled. The PGA Tour confirmed that it does not believe that Singh intended to gain an unfair advantage over his fellow competitors in this matter. Other terms of the settlement were not announced. 
===Senior career===
Singh played his first PGA Tour Champions event in 2013, finishing T6 at the Pacific Links Hawai&#x27;i Championship. During this era, he still played some PGA Tour events, finishing second at the Quicken Loans National, three strokes behind winner Billy Hurley III.

In 2017, Singh won his first senior event, the Bass Pro Shops Legends of Golf with Carlos Franco. In March 2018, Singh won the Toshiba Classic. Four months later, in July, Singh won one of the PGA Tour Champions&#x27; major tournaments, the Constellation Senior Players Championship in a playoff over Jeff Maggert. At the end of the season, in November, Singh won the season-ending Charles Schwab Cup Championship in Phoenix, Arizona. The victory was worth $440,000. By winning the tournament, he also finished fourth in the season-long Charles Schwab Cup, winning an additional $200,000.

In March 2019, Singh shot his way into the final group of the final round of the Honda Classic. Singh shot even-par to finish sixth, three strokes behind winner Keith Mitchell.

== Personal life ==
An Indo-Fijian practising Hinduism, Singh was born in Lautoka, Fiji and grew up in Nadi. A resident of Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, he is known for his meticulous preparation, often arriving hours before, and staying long after his tournament rounds to work on his game on the driving range and putting greens.

Singh has a brother named Krishna who is also a professional golfer.

==Media relations==

Controversy surrounded Singh in 2003 before the Bank of America Colonial. Annika Sörenstam was scheduled to play the event, and Singh was quoted as saying, &quot;I hope she misses the cut ... because she doesn&#x27;t belong out here.&quot; He later said that the substance of his interview to an Associated Press reporter was that she would be displacing some other struggling male player, for whom he had his sympathies. However, the media focused on this statement. &quot;Golf Digest&quot; wrote that Singh had become &quot;pro golf&#x27;s bad guy&quot;.

After Singh&#x27;s win at the Masters, Ernie Els took issue with some of the negative press his friend received. He wrote an article in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; to defend him, saying, &quot;Golf should be proud of Vijay Singh.&quot; Later Els said of Singh &quot;He&#x27;s a wonderful guy. I&#x27;ve known him for the better part of 10 years now. He&#x27;s a great competitor. I think people have a misconception of Vijay. He&#x27;s a really good guy.&quot;

In May 2005, Singh was appointed a goodwill ambassador for Fiji. He said that he did not expect anything in return from the Fijian government for representing his country. At a press conference on 18 May 2005, Singh commented on what he said was a deterioration in race relations in Fiji, saying that for such a small country, people of all races should live together, put their differences aside, and get on with life. Relations between Indo-Fijians and indigenous Fijians had been more harmonious when he was younger, he said.

<text>North Warwickshire is a local government district with borough status in Warwickshire, England. The borough includes the two towns of Atherstone (where the council is based) and Coleshill, and the large villages of Hartshill, Kingsbury, Mancetter, Polesworth and Water Orton along with smaller villages and surrounding rural areas.

The area historically had a large coal mining industry, but the last coal mine in the area, Daw Mill at Arley, closed in 2013. The borough&#x27;s landscape is primarily of the mildly undulating agricultural variety, with the North Warwickshire plateau rising to 177 m (581 ft) above sea-level at Bentley Common, 2.5 miles southwest of Atherstone. The most significant bodies of water within North Warwickshire are Kingsbury Water Park, Shustoke Reservoir, the River Blythe and the mid-section of the Coventry Canal.

The neighbouring districts are Nuneaton and Bedworth, Coventry, Solihull, Birmingham, Lichfield, Tamworth, North West Leicestershire and Hinckley and Bosworth.

==History==
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, by a merger of one previous district with part of another, these were:
*Atherstone Rural District
*Meriden Rural District (remainder split between Solihull and Coventry in the new West Midlands county)
The new district was named North Warwickshire, reflecting its position in the wider county. The district was awarded borough status from its creation, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor.

==Governance==
North Warwickshire Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Warwickshire County Council. The whole borough is also covered by civil parish, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since the 2023 election, being led by a Conservative minority administration with informal support from two of the three independent councillors.

The first elections to the council were held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in North Warwickshire. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 2009 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election the composition of the council was:
Two of the three independent councillors sit together as the &quot;Dordon Independents&quot; group, which supported the Conservatives in forming a minority administration in May 2023. The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2003 the council has comprised 35 councillors representing 17 wards with each ward electing two councillors except the Arley and Whitacre ward, which elects three. Elections are held every four years.

===Premises===
The council is based at the Council House on South Street in Atherstone. The building was purpose-built for the council and opened in 1979.

<text>Nicola James Capaldi (2 August 1944 – 28 January 2005) was an English singer-songwriter and drummer. His musical career spanned more than four decades. He co-founded the progressive rock band Traffic in 1967 with Steve Winwood with whom he co-wrote the majority of the band&#x27;s material. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a part of Traffic&#x27;s original lineup.

Capaldi also performed with Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, George Harrison, Alvin Lee, Cat Stevens, and Mylon LeFevre, and wrote lyrics for other artists, such as &quot;Love Will Keep Us Alive&quot; and &quot;This is Reggae Music&quot;. As a solo artist he scored more than a half dozen chart hits in various countries, the best-known being &quot;That&#x27;s Love&quot; as well as his cover of &quot;Love Hurts&quot;.

==Career==
===Early years===
Capaldi was born Nicola James Capaldi in Evesham, Worcestershire, to English parents Marie (née Couchier) and Nicholas Capaldi. His father was born Nicola Capaldi in 1913 in Evesham to Italian parents. As a child, Capaldi studied piano and voice with his father, a music teacher, and by his teens he was playing drums with his friends. At age 14, he founded the band the Sapphires and served as their lead vocalist. At 16 he took an apprenticeship at a factory in Worcester, where he met Keith Miller and Dave Mason. In 1963 he formed the Hellions, with Mason on guitar and Gordon Jackson on rhythm guitar, while Capaldi himself switched to drums. In August 1964, Tanya Day took the Hellions to the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany, as her backing group. The Spencer Davis Group were staying at the same hotel as the Hellions and it was there that Steve Winwood befriended Capaldi and Mason.

Back in Worcester, the Hellions provided backing to visiting performers including Adam Faith and Dave Berry. By the end of 1964, they had a London residency at the Whisky a Go Go Club. In 1964–65 the band released three singles, but none charted. Later that year John &quot;Poli&quot; Palmer joined the band on drums and Capaldi became the lead vocalist.

The Hellions moved back to Worcester in 1966 where they changed their name to the Revolution, releasing a fourth single that also failed to chart. Disillusioned, Dave Mason left the band. Capaldi replaced Mason with Luther Grosvenor and renamed the band Deep Feeling. Capaldi, Jackson, and Palmer wrote original songs for the band that were heavier than the Hellions repertoire. They played gigs in Birmingham and the surrounding Black Country area; former Yardbirds manager Giorgio Gomelsky offered them a recording contract. They recorded several studio tracks from 1966 to 1968 which remained unreleased until 2009, when the album &quot;Pretty Colours&quot; was released by Sunbeam Records.

===First success===
Capaldi and the band played frequently in London, and Jimi Hendrix played guitar with them at the Knuckles Club as an unknown musician. Back in Birmingham Capaldi would occasionally join his friends Mason, Winwood, and Chris Wood for after-hours impromptu performances at The Elbow Room club on Aston High Street. Early in 1967 they formalised this arrangement by forming Traffic, and Deep Feeling disbanded.

The new band was signed by Island Records and rented a quiet cottage in Aston Tirrold, Berkshire, to write and rehearse new material. The cottage did not remain quiet and had frequent visitors including Eric Burdon, Eric Clapton, and Pete Townshend as well as Trevor Burton (of The Move) amongst many others.

Capaldi wrote the lyrics for Traffic&#x27;s first single &quot;Paper Sun&quot;, which appeared in the UK singles chart at number 5 in summer 1967. This was the beginning of a songwriting partnership between him and Winwood which would produce the overwhelming majority of Traffic&#x27;s songs: With the exception of &quot;No Face, No Name, No Number&quot;, Capaldi would pen a lyric first, and then hand it over to Winwood to write the music.

Despite his key role in writing the band&#x27;s material, Capaldi rarely sang lead vocals with Traffic, and his lyrics were nearly always keyed towards Winwood&#x27;s soulful voice rather than his own more hard-edged vocal style.

Two more Traffic singles were released successfully in 1967, and in December the band released the album &quot;Mr. Fantasy&quot;. After one further album, &quot;Traffic&quot;, the group disbanded.

===Traffic revival===

Capaldi formed another band with Mason, Wood, and Mick Weaver but the creative tensions that had caused Mason to leave Traffic remained and the resulting quartet lasted only until March 1969. In January 1970 Capaldi and Wood joined Winwood in the studio to record Winwood&#x27;s solo album. These sessions were so successful that the three of them reformed Traffic to release the album &quot;John Barleycorn Must Die&quot;. They then toured the UK and the US with an expanded line-up, which would go on to produce the hit albums &quot;Welcome to the Canteen&quot; and &quot;The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys&quot;. The title track of the latter, a cynical treatise on the music industry, would prove to be one of Capaldi&#x27;s most famous lyrics. In addition, &quot;Rock and Roll Stew (part 1)&quot;, a rare instance of a Traffic song with Capaldi on lead vocal, was a minor hit in the US.

===Final Traffic years, first solo years===

With Traffic on hiatus due to Steve Winwood&#x27;s struggles with peritonitis, Capaldi recorded a solo album &quot;Oh How We Danced&quot; in 1972. This set contained a broad variety of musical styles and featured contributions from Free guitarist Paul Kossoff, the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, and several members of Traffic. It was well received by critics and proved to be a modest success in the US, encouraging Capaldi to pursue a solo career alongside his work with Traffic.

After two more albums with Traffic, the group took a short break, allowing Capaldi to record &quot;Whale Meat Again&quot;, which was slightly less successful than his debut both in terms of reviews and sales. The title track was a thoroughly hard rocking and unapologetic environmentalist tirade; aggressive sociopolitical-themed songs became a recurring theme in Capaldi&#x27;s work. He began work on his third solo album, &quot;Short Cut Draw Blood&quot;, alongside recording &quot;When the Eagle Flies&quot; with Traffic. As the band set off on the supporting tour, an early single from &quot;Short Cut&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s All Up to You&quot;, made the UK Top 40. Though Capaldi&#x27;s first major solo hit, it proved only a prelude to the album&#x27;s chief success. Traffic disbanded after the tour, leaving Capaldi to focus all his efforts on his solo career. &quot;Short Cut Draw Blood&quot; appeared the following year. In October 1975, a single taken from the album, a cover version of The Everly Brothers&#x27; &quot;Love Hurts&quot;, reached number four in the UK chart and charted worldwide. The album is considered by many to be his masterpiece, tackling issues such as the environment, government corruption, and drugs. He also embarked on a very brief acting career, appearing in the rarely seen 30-minute short film &quot;Short Ends&quot; (1976), which was directed by Esther Anderson and co-starred Judy Geeson and Hilary Baker.

===To disco and back===
However, events would conspire to prevent Capaldi from consolidating his solo stardom. He began working on his next album, &quot;Play it by Ear&quot;, alongside serving as a major collaborator on Steve Winwood&#x27;s first solo album. &quot;Play it by Ear&quot; took an unusually long time to record, and in the meantime, his long-standing relationship with Island Records fell apart. The album was cancelled as a result, even though an advance single, &quot;Goodbye My Love&quot; (no connection to &quot;Goodbye Love&quot; from Capaldi&#x27;s previous album), had already been released. Capaldi later described his leaving Island Records as &quot;a leap into the wilderness.&quot; Due to these delays, it was over two years after &quot;Short Cut Draw Blood&quot; that another Jim Capaldi album appeared.

At this time Capaldi wrote the soundtrack to the award-winning film &quot;The Contender&quot;, his last recording with the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section as his backing band, and correspondingly put together a new backing band for himself called the Contenders. The group consisted of Pete Bonas (guitar), Chris Parren (miscellaneous keyboards), Ray Allen (saxophone, backing vocals, percussion), and Phil Capaldi (backing vocals, percussion). Bonas was a particularly significant collaborator, and would co-write many of Capaldi&#x27;s songs. The band chiefly supported him on tour; only one album, &quot;Electric Nights&quot;, featured the Contenders on every track. At the encouragement of his new label, RSO Records, Capaldi began venturing into disco. His first album with the label, &quot;The Contender&quot;, was released in the US with the title &quot;Daughter of the Night&quot; and a partially different set of songs. However, the album&#x27;s internationally released single, &quot;Daughter of the Night&quot;, failed to make a major impact.

The follow-up, 1979&#x27;s &quot;Electric Nights&quot;, was more successful. &quot;Shoe Shine&quot;, which combined disco rhythms and melodies with an angry lead vocal and lyrics about poverty and destitution, reached number 11 in France and also entered Billboard&#x27;s Dance Music/Club Play Singles chart. However, despite including both hard rockers such as &quot;Elixir of Life&quot; and &quot;Hotel Blues&quot; and laments such as &quot;Short Ends&quot; and &quot;Wild Geese&quot; alongside the disco-flavoured numbers, Capaldi retained no fondness for his two albums with RSO, later saying &quot;frankly, they got buried under a pile of disco.&quot;

Switching record labels again, Capaldi dropped the disco elements entirely for his next two albums, &quot;The Sweet Smell of... Success&quot; (1980) and &quot;Let the Thunder Cry&quot; (1981). The albums were evenly split between mellow pop and embittered hard rock, with &quot;Success&quot; sporting a morbid before/after cover, and some tracks incorporated a Latin influence from Capaldi&#x27;s new home, Brazil. However, though &quot;Child in the Storm&quot; reached number 75 in the Netherlands, there was nothing resembling a major hit, not even the folk arrangement of Traffic&#x27;s &quot;The Low Spark of High-Heeled Boys&quot;.

The album &quot;Let the Thunder Cry&quot; was released in Brazil by Young/RGE in early 1981 and spawned two big hits there: &quot;Old Photographs&quot;, a cover version of &quot;Casinha branca&quot; originally recorded by Gilson in 1979; and &quot;Favella Music&quot;. &quot;Old Photographs&quot; became a hit after it was included in the international soundtrack of the Rede Globo soap opera &quot;Brilhante&quot; in late 1981. &quot;Favella Music&quot; was also a hit in late 1981.

===Return to stardom===
Capaldi and Winwood had maintained a working partnership since Traffic&#x27;s dissolution, contributing to nearly all of each other&#x27;s solo albums. With his eighth solo album, Capaldi enlisted his old partner as a major collaborator. For the first time, Capaldi played most of the drums himself, and he would continue to do so on future solo albums. However, most of the tracks on &quot;Fierce Heart&quot; were mixed to place emphasis on the synthesizers, often muting Capaldi&#x27;s vocals. This synth-heavy pop sound was exactly what 1980s audiences were looking for, and &quot;That&#x27;s Love&quot; became his biggest hit in the US, climbing to number 28 in the summer of 1983. Another single from the album, &quot;Living on the Edge&quot;, made it to number 75, while the album made it to 91 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

This time Capaldi was able to quickly produce a follow-up, but despite his recent success and appearances by Steve Marriott, Snowy White, and Carlos Santana, 1984&#x27;s &quot;One Man Mission&quot; failed to produce a hit. The album leaned more towards hard rock than &quot;Fierce Heart&quot;, but drum machines and synthesizers remained major components.
In 1988, Capaldi released &quot;Some Come Running&quot;. Though the album failed to live up to commercial expectations, it reached number 183 in the US and number 46 in Sweden, while achieving two hit singles in the Netherlands. Though Eric Clapton and George Harrison appeared on &quot;Oh Lord, Why Lord&quot;, it was &quot;Something so Strong&quot; which became his biggest hit in the Netherlands, breaking the top 40 and powering the album itself into the charts.

&quot;Some Come Running&quot; essentially marked the end of Capaldi&#x27;s career as a solo artist. He would not record another solo album for well over a decade, though a greatest hits compilation, &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot;, was released in 1995 and made the charts in the Netherlands.

===Collaborations===
Capaldi&#x27;s success as a lyricist continued throughout his life. In 1990 &quot;One and Only Man&quot;, a Steve Winwood song for which Capaldi wrote the lyrics, reached the Top 20 in the US. He was a five times winner of BMI/Ascap Awards for the &quot;most played compositions in America&quot;, and sales of songs written or co-written by him exceeded 25 million units. He numbered Bob Marley among his friends, and they travelled together while Marley was writing the &quot;Catch A Fire&quot; album. Capaldi wrote the lyrics to &quot;This Is Reggae Music&quot;.

Capaldi was noted for the extent of his collaborations with other musicians. In 1973, he played drums at Eric Clapton&#x27;s Rainbow Concert and on some Clapton studio sessions. Capaldi collaborated with Robert Calvert of Hawkwind on his critically acclaimed 1974 solo album Captain Lockheed and the Starfighters, contributing as a vocal actor on the concept album&#x27;s theatrical sections between songs. In the 1980s, Capaldi collaborated with Carlos Santana contributing songs and ideas to Santana&#x27;s projects and in the 1990s he co-wrote (with Paul Carrack) the song &quot;Love Will Keep Us Alive&quot;, which was eventually used on the Eagles&#x27; successful &quot;Hell Freezes Over&quot; album. In 1993, Traffic reformed and toured the US and UK. Capaldi and Winwood recorded a new album, &quot;Far from Home&quot;, without the other members of the band. In 1998 he paired up again with Mason on an extensive American tour. 

===The final years===
In 2001, Capaldi&#x27;s eleventh solo album &quot;Living on the Outside&quot; featured George Harrison, Steve Winwood, Paul Weller, Gary Moore, and Ian Paice. George Harrison played guitar on the track &quot;Anna Julia&quot;, an English translation of a song by the Brazilian band Los Hermanos. Both Capaldi brothers played at the Concert for George in 2002.

==Personal life==
Capaldi married Brazilian-born Aninha E S Campos in 1975 in All Saints Church, Marlow and in 1976 toured with his band Space Cadets before moving to Brazil in 1977.

He had two daughters, Tabitha born in 1976 and Tallulah born in 1979. The Capaldis lived in the Bahia region of Brazil until the beginning of 1980 and while there he became heavily involved with environmental issues. They maintained homes in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, and Ipanema, Rio de Janeiro. The track &quot;Favela Music&quot; on his 1981 album &quot;Let The Thunder Cry&quot; arose from his love of Brazil, and he worked with several Brazilian composers.

Capaldi was a friend and supporter of the London School of Samba and played with the bateria on at least one occasion. He did a lot of charitable work for organisations in Brazil, such as the Associação Beneficiente São Martinho street children&#x27;s charity in Lapa, Rio de Janeiro, which the LSS also supported between 1994 and 2001. His wife was also the &quot;Porta Bandeira&quot; (flag bearer) of the LSS in the 1994 and 1995 Notting Hill Carnival parades.

Outside his music and environmental activism, Capaldi also assisted his wife in her work with Jubilee Action to help Brazilian street children. Because of this charity work, Capaldi and his wife were guests of Tony Blair at the Prime Minister&#x27;s country house, Chequers. He remained professionally active until his final illness prevented him from working on plans for a 2005 reunion tour of Traffic. He died of stomach cancer in Westminster, London, on 28 January 2005, aged 60.

==Tributes==
Following his death, several tributes in celebration of Capaldi&#x27;s life and music came out under the name &quot;Dear Mr Fantasy&quot;. The first was a tribute concert that took place at the Roundhouse in Camden Town, London on Sunday, 21 January 2007. Guests included Bill Wyman (Rolling Stones), Jon Lord (Deep Purple), Gary Moore (Thin Lizzy), Steve Winwood (Traffic), Cat Stevens (aka Yusuf Islam), Joe Walsh (The Eagles), Paul Weller (The Jam), Pete Townshend (The Who), Jim&#x27;s brother Phil, and many more. The performances were evenly split between Capaldi&#x27;s solo songs and his work with Traffic. All profits went to The Jubilee Action Street Children Appeal. A recording of the concert was released as a double CD set the same year.

The second such tribute, &quot;Dear Mr. Fantasy: The Jim Capaldi Story&quot;, is a four-disc boxed set released in July 2011. Though a slight majority of the tracks came from Capaldi&#x27;s solo albums, it also included some of his work with the Hellions, Deep Feeling, and Traffic, a few rare non-album tracks, and more than ten previously unreleased recordings, including a song co-written with George Harrison in 1997. The box was also packaged with extensive liner notes, compiling a number of photos and essays.

The third and final tribute is a book of Capaldi&#x27;s handwritten lyrics, released in November 2011. The ideas of a boxed set and lyrics book had been conceived by Capaldi shortly before he died, and their releases were prepared by his widow in fulfilment of a last promise to him.

<doc id="426494" wikidata="Q255911" url="?curid=426494" title="NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series">
<text>The NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series is a pickup truck racing series owned and operated by the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR), and is the only series in NASCAR to race production pickup truck-based stock cars. The series is one of three national divisions of NASCAR, ranking as the third tier behind the second-tier NASCAR Xfinity Series and the top level NASCAR Cup Series and is also the youngest NASCAR-sanctioned national racing competition to date.

The 2023 season was the first with Stanley Black &amp; Decker holding the series&#x27; naming rights. Previously, Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co held title sponsorship from 1995 through 2008 with the Craftsman brand, during which the series was known as the NASCAR SuperTruck Series in 1995 and the Craftsman Truck Series from 1996 through 2008. Camping World took over the sponsorship to dub the Camping World Truck Series from 2009 through 2018, followed by the Gander Outdoors Truck Series in 2019, the Gander RV &amp; Outdoors Truck Series in 2020, and a return to the Camping World name in 2021 and 2022. Stanley Black &amp; Decker, which acquired the Craftsman brand in 2017, took over starting in 2023.

==History==
===Sears, Roebuck, &amp; Co. (1995–2008)===

The idea for the Truck Series dates back to 1991. A group of SCORE off-road racers (Dick Landfield, Jimmy Smith, Jim Venable, and Frank &quot;Scoop&quot; Vessels) had concerns about desert racing&#x27;s future, and decided to create a pavement truck racing series. They visited NASCAR Western Operations Vice President Ken Clapp to promote the idea, who consulted Bill France Jr. with it, but the plans fell apart. Afterwards, Clapp told the four to build a truck before NASCAR considered it. Bakersfield fabricator Gary Collins built a prototype truck, which was first shown off during Speedweeks for the 1994 Daytona 500 and tested by truck owner Jim Smith around Daytona International Speedway. The truck proved to be popular among fans, and NASCAR arranged a meeting in a Burbank, California hotel on April 11, 1994; the meeting ultimately led to the creation of the &quot;SuperTruck Series&quot;.

Four demonstration races were held at Mesa Marin Raceway, Portland Speedway, Saugus Speedway and Tucson Raceway Park. Tucson held four events that winter, which were nationally televised during the Winter Heat Series coverage. Sears, Roebuck, &amp; Co., through the Craftsman brand, served as the sponsor of the series on a three-year deal, and the series was renamed to the Craftsman Truck Series in 1996. In addition, the series&#x27; $580,000 purse is larger than the Busch Grand National Series&#x27; fund. While a new series, it garnered immediate support from many prominent Winston Cup Series team owners and drivers. Prominent Cup owners Richard Childress, Rick Hendrick, and Jack Roush owned truck teams, and top drivers such as Dale Earnhardt and Ernie Irvan also fielded SuperTrucks for others. The series also attracted the attention of drivers like sprint car racing star Sammy Swindell, Walker Evans of off-road racing fame, open-wheel veteran Mike Bliss, and Atlanta Falcons head coach Jerry Glanville. The inaugural race, the Skoal Bandit Copper World Classic at Phoenix International Raceway, was held on February 5; the race, featuring an event-record crowd of 38,000 spectators, concluded with eventual series champion Mike Skinner holding off Cup veteran Terry Labonte to win. Only one team from the first season of the series, FDNY Racing, is still racing in the series today.

===Camping World Holdings (2009–2022)===

At the end of the 2008 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series schedule, Craftsman ended its sponsorship of the series. Subsequently, Camping World signed a seven-year contract with NASCAR, rebranding the series as the Camping World Truck Series.

With decreasing money and increasing costs, the series has struggled financially with sponsorship and prize money, the latter often being low, while the former would prompt teams to shut down to reduce in size. Teams like Richard Childress Racing, a Cup team with 31 Truck wins, shut down their Truck operations; in RCR&#x27;s case, after the 2013 season. After the 2014 season, Brad Keselowski stated his Brad Keselowski Racing team had lost $1 million despite recording a win that year, and told the &quot;Sporting News&quot;: &quot;The truck series, you have to be able to lose money on a constant basis. That&#x27;s just how the system works.&quot; BKR ended up shutting down after the 2017 season. To cut costs, NASCAR required teams to use sealed engines, with teams not being allowed to run at most three races with a previously used engine. Additionally, NASCAR reduced the maximum number of pit crew members allowed over the wall for a pit stop from seven to five, and required teams to only take either fuel or tires on a single pit stop in 2009. This requirement was abandoned for the 2010 season.

Starting with the 2011 season, NASCAR implemented a new rule that allows drivers to compete for the drivers&#x27; championship in only one of the three national touring series (Cup, Xfinity, or Truck) in a given season. On January 19, 2016, NASCAR announced the introduction of a playoff format similar to the NASCAR Cup Series Chase for the Championship: the format consists of eight drivers across three rounds, with two drivers being eliminated after each round. Starting in 2020 season, the playoff was expanded to 10 drivers, with two being eliminated after the first round and four being eliminated after the second round.

Camping World signed a seven-year extension in 2014 to remain the title sponsor of the Truck Series until at least 2022. On May 8, 2018, NASCAR and Camping World announced the Truck Series&#x27; title sponsorship would be switched to its subsidiary Gander Outdoors starting in 2019, renaming it the Gander Outdoors Truck Series. The series was slightly renamed to the Gander RV &amp; Outdoors Truck Series in 2020, but returned to the Camping World Truck Series branding the following season.

===Stanley Black &amp; Decker (2023–present)===

On August 26, 2022, NASCAR announced a multi-year sponsorship deal with Stanley Black &amp; Decker—which had acquired the Craftsman brand from Sears in 2017—under which the series would return to being known as the Craftsman Truck Series beginning in 2023. As part of the deal, Stanley Black &amp; Decker also became the official tool brand of NASCAR.
==Drivers==
Most of the first drivers in the series were veteran short track drivers who had not made it or struggled to thrive in the other NASCAR national series; for example, 1991 Featherlite Southwest Tour champion Rick Carelli had failed to qualify twelve times for Cup races across 1991–1994, with only nine career Cup starts, but he finished sixth in the inaugural Truck Series championship. It is worth noting that most of the early champions have become NASCAR Cup Series regulars later in their careers, such as 1995 champion Skinner, who joined Richard Childress Racing&#x27;s Cup team in 1997, competing on a full-time basis until 2003. Professional football coach Jerry Glanville was among the series&#x27; first drivers. As the years went on, a number of younger drivers debuted in the series, using the series as a springboard for their racing careers. NASCAR stars Greg Biffle, Kevin Harvick, Jamie McMurray, Kurt Busch, Carl Edwards, and Kyle Busch each started in the series.

A 2001 Truck Series race incident resulted in a significant NASCAR rule change. In early November of that year, the Truck Series was running as a support race for CART&#x27;s Marlboro 500, that series&#x27; final event of its season; since the race weekend was being staged by CART and not NASCAR, its rules had to be followed. As a result, the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement was effective. Thus, any driver who participated in the race weekend had to be at least 18 years of age. The rule affected Roush Racing&#x27;s No. 99 truck driven by Kyle Busch, as he was underage at the time (16) and thus disqualified from the event despite having already qualified. The issue resulted in a 2002 rule change that mandated that any driver competing in a NASCAR national touring series (Truck, Busch, Cup) or any regional series race on the weekend of a national series race must be at least 18 in order to comply with the Master Settlement Agreement. After NASCAR phased out tobacco sponsorships, the minimum age for regional touring series was changed to 16, and the Truck Series&#x27; rule regulated a minimum age of 16 for any oval circuit two kilometers (1.25 miles) or shorter or road courses, with a rule of 18 for ovals 1.33 miles or longer.

In later years, though, the Truck Series has also become a place for Cup veterans without a ride to make their living which included Ricky Craven, Jimmy Spencer, Dennis Setzer, Brendan Gaughan (who started his career in a family-owned team, and after his Nextel Cup attempt, returned to the family operation), Rich Bickle, Andy Houston, Todd Bodine, Bobby Hamilton Jr. and previous champions Johnny Benson, Mike Skinner, Ron Hornaday, Ted Musgrave, and Jack Sprague. Older drivers dominated the series, most with Xfinity and Cup Series experience: in 2007, all the top-10 drivers were over 30 years of age, and 7 of the 10 had Cup experience, as did every race winner except Erik Darnell. Even though novice drivers play a minimal role in this &quot;minor league&quot; series, there is no controversy like the disputes over &quot;Buschwhackers&quot; in the Busch (later Nationwide, now Xfinity Series). No current Cup regulars drive a full Truck Series schedule, although Cup driver Kevin Harvick owned his own team in the series until 2011, Brad Keselowski owned his own team until he announced its cessation of operations in 2017. A current Truck Series field could be split into three groups: Cup drivers that compete as owner-drivers like Busch, or to receive additional money like David Gilliland; Truck regulars who compete full-time in the series; and young drivers who use the Truck Series to enter NASCAR.

==Racing and strategy==
===Qualifying===
A Truck Series field currently consists of 36 trucks in races with qualifying. Previously, 32 trucks comprised a field, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the field was increased to 36 in races with qualifying and 40 without to accommodate as many trucks as possible.

For most races, a single-truck qualifying format is used. For tracks 1.25 miles and shorter, each truck gets two laps with the fastest lap counting. At tracks longer than 1.25 miles each truck only gets one timed lap. Road course events use a 2 part knockout qualifying format similar to Formula 1, with the top 12 qualifiers from Q1 advancing to Q2. At the event at Eldora, qualifying sets the lineups for a series of heat races which then determines the lineup.

===The race===

Initially, the series used a number of rules that differed from both Winston Cup and Busch Grand National Series racing. Most of the first races were no longer than 125 miles in length, with many being 150-lap races on short tracks. To save teams money by not requiring teams to hire pit specialists and buy extra tires, and because some tracks – Saugus Speedway, Flemington Raceway, Tucson Raceway Park, Evergreen Speedway and Colorado National Speedway most notably—did not have a pit road safe enough for pit stops, or had pits outside the track, starting with the second race of the series in Tucson, NASCAR adopted a five-minute &quot;halftime&quot; break, in place of pit stops, where teams could make any changes they would want to the truck. The only time tire changes were possible were for the interest of safety, such as a tire failure, or a danger to the tire. The rule was popular with television and fans, and was spread for the entire schedule afterwards as pit reporters could interview drivers and crew chiefs for the break in a time without stress. However, starting in 1998, NASCAR introduced competition cautions, with each team being awarded four sets of tires; with this rule change, the halftime break was abolished starting with the race at Pikes Peak International Raceway. In 1999, full pit stops were added, with drivers being allowed to pit during races, but were not allowed to change more than two tires during a stop.

In 1996, some races went to two intermissions for full tire and fuel stops, while longer races were stopped at three times—a limited break near the one-quarter and three-quarter marks for fuel stops, and at the halfway point for fuel and tire stops. If tire wear was a concern, NASCAR also permitted two-tire changes if necessary in the first and third period breaks. These rules were influential in driver development. Drivers had to learn to conserve tire wear for up to a half race, which allowed them to learn conserving the truck. Some drivers used the rules to learn tire conservation for other series. In 1997, NASCAR started phasing pit stops. During the 1997 season, trucks could only legally take fuel and make adjustments during pit stops during the race. Tire changes were still illegal except for emergency causes and at break times.

For a short time in 1995, NASCAR adopted traditional short-track rules by inverting a number of cars at the front of the grid after complaints about some races where drivers led the entire event. That was dropped quickly after some races ended as walkovers for drivers, leading entire races.
A more popular rule that was effective until the middle of the 2004 season was the &quot;overtime&quot; rule. Unless interrupted by weather, Craftsman Truck Series races had to end under green flag conditions, and the rule mandated that all races must end with a minimum of two consecutive laps in green flag condition, often referred to as a &quot;green-white-checkered&quot; finish. Since racing to the yellow flag was prohibited until 1998 (and again in 2003 under the current free pass rule), scoring reverted to the last completed lap, and until racing back to the line was legalized in 1998, if the yellow waved during the first lap of a green-white-checkered finish, the entire situation would be reset. This rule meant some races would be greatly extended. In 1998, a CBS-televised race in Pikes Peak scheduled for 186 laps ran 198 laps (12 extra laps) because of multiple attempts, and the last such race, in Gateway International Raceway in 2004, lasted 14 additional laps (16.25 miles). A July 24, 2004 rule change for NASCAR&#x27;s three national series meant only one &quot;green-white-checkered&quot; finish can be attempted, and the race can end under yellow in one of four situations—inclement weather, darkness, the yellow flag waving because of an incident during the final lap of a race, or the yellow flag waving after the one attempt at green-white-checkered begins. This was later extended by NASCAR to three attempts. (Although reducing the Truck Series attempts at a green-white-checkered finish to one, the rule change was part of NASCAR&#x27;s implementation of the rule to the Cup and Busch Series due to complaints regarding NASCAR&#x27;s policy at the time regarding late race cautions; the policy stated that a red flag would be thrown during a late race caution to attempt to ensure the race would finish under green but if a caution occurred after the window for the red flag, the race would end under caution regardless of where the incident occurred or how severe it was). Ironically, the first Truck Series race under the new rules ended with a yellow flag on the final lap.

In 2014, NASCAR banned tandem drafting, a method of racing in which two vehicles would line up with each other to gain speed, from the Truck Series. Drivers who commit the act are black-flagged.

In the 2016 season, the Truck Series experimented with a rule similar to those used in longer-distance Super Late Model events such as the Snowball Derby that limited how long a race can go before a competition caution for pit stops or adjustments in an effort to reduce green-flag pit stops, with which younger and more inexperienced drivers were unfamiliar. The limit was 20 minutes of green flag racing (in theory 75 laps at Bristol, or 60 laps at Martinsville), without beneficiaries being awarded. Upon each restart, the clock restarted from 20:00, and each caution for an incident reset the clock back to 20:00. As is the case in the short track rules, no competition caution would be used in the final 20 laps, except for tracks where lap times are 50 seconds or greater (Pocono or Mosport), where the limit was ten laps, or Eldora because of its format. In 2017, this was replaced with the stage system adopted by all other NASCAR national series that season.

==Tracks==


Initially, the Truck Series competed primarily on short tracks and tracks in the Western United States; the series&#x27; inaugural schedule included races at tracks in Arizona, California, Colorado, Oregon and Washington, with only five races in the Southeastern U.S., such as Louisville Motor Speedway, which was not run by the Cup Series. Additionally, the longest tracks run by the series, Phoenix International Raceway and Milwaukee Mile, were one mile long. By 1998, most of the short tracks were phased out in favor of speedways of 1 to 2 miles in length, and more of the races were held at tracks that hosted Cup and Busch events concurrently, but some races were held with CART and Indy Racing League events. Road courses were phased out by 2001, the last race being in 2000 at Watkins Glen International, but returned in 2013 with the Truck race at Canadian Tire Motorsport Park. Also in 2013, the Truck Series began racing at Eldora Speedway, the first time NASCAR had raced at a dirt track since the 1970 NASCAR Grand National Series season. As of the 2023 season, the series races on 21 tracks: one dirt track (Bristol), two road courses (Circuit of the Americas and Mid-Ohio), five short tracks (Bristol, Martinsville, Richmond, North Wilkesboro, and Indianapolis Raceway Park), three superspeedways (Daytona, Talladega, and Pocono) and nine intermediate ovals. The second most recent addition to the series schedule is Atlanta Motor Speedway, which returned to hosting Truck races in 2015 after a two-year absence. The most recent addition to the series schedule is North Wilkesboro Speedway which returned to hosting Truck races after a twenty-six–year absence.

==Television and radio==
The 1995 season&#x27;s races were nationally televised on ESPN, TNN, ABC and CBS. Of the 20-race schedule, TNN aired ten races, while ESPN aired seven races and CBS two, while ABC aired the race at Mesa Marin Speedway as part of its &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot; program.
In 2001, NASCAR moved the series exclusively to cable, first with ESPN, and in 2003, switched to Speed, a network which provided supplemental coverage for Fox&#x27;s coverage of NASCAR events. Network television returned to the series from 2007 to 2010 when two races per season (the Kroger 250 at Martinsville and the City of Mansfield 250 at Mansfield, with a race at Fontana replacing Mansfield) airing on Fox as NASCAR on Fox events. These broadcasts were discontinued in 2009.

On August 13, 2013, Speed was converted into Fox Sports 1 (FS1), continuing with all Truck Series race broadcasts, whereas some practice and qualifying sessions were moved to sister channel Fox Sports 2 (FS2). For the 2014 season, the Fred&#x27;s 250 at Talladega had its race broadcast moved from FS1 to the Fox broadcast network. For the 2018 season, the UNOH 200 at Bristol aired in prime time on Fox. For the 2020 season, the Clean Harbors 200 aired on Fox. In 2022, the CRC Brakleen 150 was moved to Fox. In 2023, the Tyson 250 was moved.

Motor Racing Network has exclusive radio broadcasting rights to the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series.

==Manufacturer representation==
The series was notable in seeing the return of Chrysler Corporation factory-supported race vehicles to the tracks. Chrysler withdrew its factory support of its Dodge and Plymouth brands after the 1972 season to cut costs, though teams continued to campaign cars with Plymouth and Dodge sheetmetal and power plants until 1985. Chrysler funded a small R&amp;D effort, with factory funding and support for Dodge to return to NASCAR for the Craftsman Truck Series with the Dodge Ram pickup truck in 1997. By 2001 Dodge made a full-time return to NASCAR with a full factory-backed effort. While Dodge continued to race in the other series until 2012, the Ram Trucks division (spun off from Dodge after the Fiat Group took control of Chrysler) raced in the Camping World Truck Series in Dodge&#x27;s place. In 2014, Ram pulled out, leaving the Nationwide Series as the last series with teams fielding Dodge. As of the 2021 season, no teams in the Truck Series field Ram trucks. In February 2025, it was reported that Ram would return to the Craftsman Truck Series in 2026, ahead of a possible return to the Cup Series in 2027 or 2028.

The Truck Series was the first major NASCAR series to feature Toyota, with the Toyota Tundra model making its debut in the series in 2004; Toyota had previously competed in the mostly regional level Goody&#x27;s Dash Series. The Japanese automaker became the first foreign nameplate to race in NASCAR during the sport&#x27;s modern era. Toyota would later join the Cup series and Xfinity series as well, doing so in 2007.

<doc id="426500" wikidata="Q1042333" url="?curid=426500" title="Kevin Millwood">
<text>Kevin Austin Millwood (born December 24, 1974) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Atlanta Braves, Philadelphia Phillies, Cleveland Indians, Texas Rangers, Baltimore Orioles, Colorado Rockies and Seattle Mariners.

While with the Braves, Millwood was part of a pitching rotation which featured Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz. In 1999 he was selected to his only All-Star Game and helped lead the Braves to the 1999 World Series and two seasons later the 2001 National League Championship Series. As a member of the Indians, his 2.86 ERA led all American League pitchers. In 2012, Millwood became the 67th pitcher to record 2,000 career strikeouts.

==Early life==
Millwood was raised by Kathy Coplen and Bill Millwood in Bessemer City, North Carolina. He attended Bessemer City High School where he played baseball, basketball and football. As a basketball player, he scored 1,000 points for the Bessemer City Yellow Jackets. Milwood missed the beginning of every high school baseball season in order to finish the basketball season and did not expect to be drafted by a professional baseball team.

==Baseball career==

===Atlanta Braves===
Millwood was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the 11th round of the 1993 MLB draft. After four years in the minors, Millwood made his debut with the Atlanta Braves on July 14, 1997. A year later, he won 17 games. Millwood formed a part of the Braves&#x27; star pitching rotation, which also consisted of Greg Maddux, John Smoltz and Tom Glavine. According to Nate Silver, the 1997 Braves starting rotation was the best in the history of baseball as of the 2010 season.

In 1999, Millwood posted career-highs in wins (18, also achieved in 2002), earned run average (2.68), strikeouts (205) and WHIP (0.996). He finished third in the National League Cy Young Award voting (losing to the Arizona Diamondbacks&#x27; Randy Johnson) and 26th on the National League MVP ballot. He was selected as an All-Star in 1999, his only appearance in the Midsummer Classic.

===Philadelphia Phillies===
Before the 2003 season, Millwood was traded by the Braves to the Philadelphia Phillies for catcher Johnny Estrada in order to cut their payroll in the midst of economic difficulties. He went 14-12 with his new team, including throwing a no-hitter against the San Francisco Giants on April 27 coming in the Phillies&#x27; final season at Veterans Stadium (this was one of only two no-hitters ever thrown at the now-demolished stadium). He also led the majors in stolen bases allowed, with 41.

===Cleveland Indians===
In 2005, Millwood signed a one-year contract as a free agent with the Cleveland Indians. He came back from injury well, leading the American League in ERA (2.86). However, he managed a record of only 9—11, due to poor run support. In 2005, Millwood again led the majors in stolen bases allowed, with 33. He finished tied for sixth in balloting for the AL Cy Young Award.

===Texas Rangers===

On December 26, 2005, the Texas Rangers signed Millwood to a five-year, $60 million deal.

In 2006, he and Vicente Padilla won 15 games; a total not matched by a Rangers pitcher until Scott Feldman in 2009.

In 2008, when batters did hit the ball against him, it was with uncommon success, as his .358 batting-average-against on balls in play was the highest in the major leagues. 26% of all balls put in play against him were line drives, the highest percentage in the majors.

===Baltimore Orioles===
Millwood was traded to the Baltimore Orioles on December 9, 2009, for Chris Ray and a player to be named later (left-handed pitcher Ben Snyder, a Rule 5 pick from San Francisco).

During the 2010 season, Millwood went 4–16 with a 5.10 earned run average, leading the league in losses.

===New York Yankees===
On March 25, 2011, Millwood was signed to a minor league contract by the New York Yankees. After making three starts in the minor leagues, he opted out of his contract on May 1.

===Boston Red Sox===
Millwood signed a minor league contract with the Boston Red Sox on May 19, 2011. He was released on August 7, exercising an opt-out clause.

===Colorado Rockies===
On August 8, 2011, Millwood signed a minor league contract with the Colorado Rockies. Millwood was called up August 10 to fill a void after an injury to Juan Nicasio.

===Seattle Mariners===
On January 22, 2012, it was reported that the Seattle Mariners had signed Millwood to a minor league contract. He was called up from Triple-A and made his first major league start of the season on April 22 against the Chicago White Sox. On May 13, Millwood became the 67th pitcher to record 2,000 career strikeouts when he struck out Yankee Curtis Granderson. Millwood notched a win over Yankee starter Andy Pettitte, who was pitching in the majors for the first time since 2010.

On June 8, Millwood pitched the first six innings of a combined no-hitter against the Los Angeles Dodgers before leaving the game due to a groin injury. Charlie Furbush, Stephen Pryor, Lucas Luetge, Brandon League, and Tom Wilhelmsen helped him complete the bid. Millwood was put on the disabled list in September with soreness in his shoulder and missed the remainder of the regular season.

===Retirement===
On February 3, 2013, Millwood was reported to be retiring.

==Pitching style==
Millwood was a sinkerball pitcher. His sinker clocked at 89–92 mph and was complemented mostly by an 89–91 mph cutter and 83–86 mph slider. Millwood also threw a curveball (71–74) and a changeup (82–84) that he used against left-handed hitters. He tended to use the cutter early in the count, with higher use of his breaking balls in two-strike situations.

==Personal life==
On January 9, 1999 in Spartanburg, South Carolina, Millwood married Rena Stevens of Greenville, South Carolina.

<doc id="426504" wikidata="Q1569406" url="?curid=426504" title="Playlist">
<text>A playlist is a list of video or audio files that can be played back on a media player, either sequentially or in a shuffled order. In its most general form, an audio playlist is simply a list of songs that can be played once or in a loop. The term has several specialized meanings in the realms of television broadcasting, radio broadcasting and personal computers. 

A video playlist can also be a list of recorded titles on a digital video disk (DVD). On the internet, a playlist can be a list of chapters in a movie serial; for example, Flash Gordon in the Planet Mongo is available on YouTube as a playlist of thirteen consecutive video chapters.

==Radio==
The term originally came about in the early days of Top 40 radio formats in the 1950s when stations would devise (and, eventually, publish) a limited list of songs to be played. The term would go on to refer to the entire catalog of songs that a given radio station (of any format) would draw from. Additionally, the term was used to refer to an ordered list of songs played during a given time period. Playlists are often adjusted based on time of day, known as dayparting.

==Television==
Cable TV and broadcast TV news channels often use video playlists to rerun prerecorded news stories. A given news story might initially be shown live and then placed into a playlist to be shown over and over again at a later time. News channel broadcasting is a combination of live and pre-recorded programming. The prerecorded clips are usually run from a playlist.

==Computers and the Internet==
As music storage and playback using personal computers became common, the term &quot;playlist&quot; was adopted by various media player software programs intended to organize and control music on a PC. Such playlists may be defined, stored, and selected to run either in sequence or if a random playlist function is selected, in a random order. Playlists&#x27; uses include allowing a particular desired musical atmosphere to be created and maintained without constant user interaction or allowing a variety of different styles of music to be played, again without maintenance.

Several computer playlist formats for multimedia players, such as PLS, can pass a playlist or URL to the player. In the case of radio stations it can also link many audio players directly to the station&#x27;s live streaming audio, bypassing any need for a web browser. (In that case, the playlist file is typically downloaded from the station&#x27;s live streaming web page, if offered. The files are similar to Internet shortcut files in appearance and internal structure, except used by media players rather than web browsers.) 

Some Internet streaming services, such as Spotify, Amazon Music, 8tracks, and the defunct Playlist.com and Webjay, allow users to categorize, edit, and listen to playlists online. Other sites focus on playlist creation aided by personalized song recommendations, ratings, and reviews. On certain sites, users create and share annotated playlists, giving visitors the option to read contextual information or reviewer comments about each song while listening. Some sites only allow the sharing of the playlist data with the actual music being delivered by other channels (e.g., Plurn), others provide a closed catalog of content from which the playlists can be generated, and sites like imeem allow users to upload the music to central servers to be shared and accessed by any user of the site. iPods can also be used to build playlists.

Pandora is another music streaming service that is available on the Internet. Pandora is one of the few music services that is free (no subscription required) to users. The user can select genres that are played back at random on Pandora&#x27;s playlists.

==Celebrity playlists==
A celebrity playlist is a list of songs prepared by a celebrity and represented in popular publications and on the radio as such.

==Web video==
On video hosting service websites such as YouTube and Vimeo, users can make playlists of select videos from themselves or other users for topical purposes; paid accounts can upgrade playlists of their own videos to &quot;shows&quot;.

==Playlist generation==

Most media players, such as Winamp, can easily create custom playlists from one&#x27;s media library. For example, in a software MP3 player for Windows, Android, or macOS, the desired tunes are typically dragged and dropped from the user&#x27;s music library into the player&#x27;s &quot;edit or create playlist&quot; window and saved.

The idea of automatically generating music playlists from annotated databases was pioneered by François Pachet and Pierre Roy. Constraint satisfaction techniques were developed to create playlists that satisfy arbitrary &quot;sequence constraints&quot;, such as continuity, diversity, similarity, etc. Since, many other techniques were proposed, such as case-based reasoning.

==Other playlist methods==
* A CD player that holds multiple CDs with a programmable grid mapper.
* MP3 CDs
* Prerecording a mixtape; which is purely sequential.
* Active disc-jockeying where the user manually selects the next song one after another as opposed to a preprogrammed playlist (shuffled or not)
* Stacking records in a sequence on a vinyl record changer
* A jukebox with a programmable record changer

==Types of playlist files==
Notable file formats used for playlists include:
* .asx, an XML style playlist containing more information about the items on the playlist
* .fpl, is a format used by foobar2000.
* .kpl, Kalliope PlayList, is a kind of XML playlist storing developed to speed up loading and managing playlists.
* .m3u/.m3u8, a simple text-based list of the locations of the items, with each item on a new line. This is one of the most popular playlist types.
* .pla, Samsung format(?), binary, Winamp handles these
* .aimppl, .plc, file extensions for AIMP.
* .mpcpl file extension for Media Player Classic playlist format and its derivatives (MPC-HC, MPC-BE etc)
* .pls, a text playlist similar to .ini (program settings) files. It provides the same functionality as extended M3U playlists by default (title and length).
* .smil is an XML recommendation of the World Wide Web Consortium that includes playlist features. In addition to audio, it supports video and screen layout and is heavily used in Digital Signage.
* .vlc is a format used by VLC Media Player and is defined as a renamed M3U or PLS playlist.
* .wpl, is an XML format used in Microsoft Windows Media Player versions 9–12.
* .xspf, an XML format designed to enable playlist sharing
* .zpl is a format used by Zune Media Player, Zoom Player and Creative Zen Media Players.

<doc id="426507" wikidata="Q519778" url="?curid=426507" title="Doctrine of the Mean">
<text>The Doctrine of the Mean or Zhongyong is one of the Four Books of classical Chinese philosophy and a central doctrine of Confucianism. The text is attributed to Zisi (Kong Ji), the only grandson of Confucius (Kong Zi). It was originally a chapter in the &quot;Classic of Rites&quot;.

The phrase &quot;doctrine of the mean&quot; occurs in Book VI, verse 29 of the &quot;Analects&quot; of Confucius, which states:
The &quot;Analects&quot; never expands on what this term means, but Zisi&#x27;s text, &quot;The Doctrine of the Mean&quot;, explores its meaning in detail, as well as how to apply it to one&#x27;s life. The application of Confucian metaphysics to politics and virtue ethics. The text was adopted into the canon of the Neo-Confucian movement, as compiled by Zhu Xi.

While Burton Watson translated &quot;Zhōngyōng&quot; as &quot;Doctrine of the Mean&quot;, other English-language translators have rendered it differently. James Legge called it &quot;Constant Mean&quot;, Pierre Ryckmans (aka Simon Leys) used &quot;Middle Way&quot;, while Arthur Waley chose &quot;Middle Use&quot;. Ezra Pound&#x27;s translations include &quot;Unswerving Pivot&quot; and &quot;Unwobbling Pivot&quot;. Roger T. Ames and David L. Hall titled their 2001 translation &quot;Focusing the Familiar&quot;.

==Authorship==

The authorship of &quot;The Doctrine of the Mean&quot; is controversial. Traditionally, authorship of the treatise (which was actually a chapter from &quot;Liji&quot;, one of the Five Classics of antiquity) was attributed to Zisi (Kong Ji / Tzu Ssu / Zi Si / 子思), a grandson of Confucius and disciple of Zeng Shen; however, this was first questioned by Qing dynasty scholar Cui Shu (1740—1816). According to some modern scholars parts of it may have been written or edited by Confucians during the transition from the Qin to Han dynasties. However, it is widely agreed that the book presents the ethical core of Confucian teachings. Others seem to attribute it to Confucius himself.

==Interpretation==
&quot;The Doctrine of the Mean&quot; is a text rich with symbolism and guidance to perfecting oneself. The mean is also described as the &quot;unswerving pivot&quot; or &quot;zhongyong&quot;. &quot;Zhong&quot; means bent neither one way or another, and &quot;yong&quot; represents unchanging. In James Legge&#x27;s translation of the text, the goal of the mean is to maintain balance and harmony from directing the mind to a state of constant equilibrium. The person who follows the mean is on a path of duty and must never leave it. A superior person is cautious, a gentle teacher and shows no contempt for their inferiors. The person always does what is natural according to their status in the world. Even common people can carry the mean into their practices, as long as they do not exceed their natural order.

&quot;The Doctrine of the Mean&quot; represents moderation, rectitude, objectivity, sincerity, honesty and propriety. The guiding principle is that one should never act in excess. &quot;The Doctrine of the Mean&quot; is divided into three parts:

# The Axis – Confucian Metaphysics
# The Process – Politics
# The Perfect Word/Sincerity – Ethics (The Great Digest and Unwobbling Pivot, 1951).

==Guidelines==
&quot;Doctrine of the Mean&quot; proposed three guidelines—Self-watchfulness, Leniency and Sincerity—for how to pursue the Doctrine of the Mean, and one who follows these guidelines can be called a respectable person:

&quot;Zhong-ni said, &#x27;The respectable person embodies the course of the Mean; the average person acts contrary to the course of the Mean.&quot;

===Self-watchfulness===

This guideline requires self-education, self-questioning and self-discipline during the process of self-cultivation. This principle was exposited in the first chapter of &quot;Doctrine of the Mean&quot;:

&quot;The respectable person does not wait till he sees things to be cautious, nor till he hears things to be apprehensive. There is nothing more visible than what is secret, and nothing more manifest than what is minute. Therefore the superior person is watchful over himself, when he is alone.&quot;

===Leniency===

This guideline requires understanding, concern and tolerance towards one another. Leniency was exposited in the 13th chapter:

&quot;When one cultivates to the utmost the principles of his nature, and exercises them on the principle of reciprocity, he is not far from the path. What you do not like when done to yourself, do not do to others.&quot;

In this chapter, Confucius explained this guideline with four examples: &quot;to serve my father, as I would require my son to serve me&quot;, &quot; to serve my prince as I would require my minister to serve me&quot;, &quot;to serve my elder brother as I would require my younger brother to serve me&quot;, &quot;to set the example in behaving to a friend, as I would require him to behave to me.&quot;

===Sincerity===

Sincerity contributes to a close connection between Heaven and human. This guideline was exposited in the 23rd chapter:

&quot;It is only he who is possessed of the most complete sincerity that can exist under heaven, who can give its full development to his nature. Able to give its full development to his own nature, he can do the same to the nature of other men. Able to give its full development to the nature of other men, he can give their full development to the natures of animals and things. Able to give their full development to the natures of creatures and things, he can assist the transforming and nourishing powers of Heaven and Earth. Able to assist the transforming and nourishing powers of Heaven and Earth, he may with Heaven and Earth form a ternion.&quot;

==In Chinese society==
In China prior to the twentieth century the &quot;Doctrine of the Mean&quot; was integrated into the education system statewide. Also, one of the prerequisites for employment in the imperial government was the study and understanding of the Four Classics, included in this is the &quot;Doctrine of the Mean&quot;. The imperial state wanted to reinforce the three bonds of society; between the parent and child, husband and wife, and ruler and subject. This was believed to emphasize a peaceful home and an orderly state.

Recently in China, the New Confucians revisited the Classics, because of its strong foundation in the educational system. Using the &quot;Doctrine of the Mean&quot; has become a useful source for New Confucians due to the similarities in the terminology and expression used by them and found within the text. This is further reinforced by the support from ancient sages and worthies who prefer education systems more closely linked to traditional Confucian thought.

==Modern views==

Sun Yat-sen critiqued the doctrine. 

Chiang Kai-shek praised the doctrine as the book that introduced him to learning and as an essence of ancient Chinese learned thought.

According to Mao Zedong&#x27;s comment on Ai Siqi&#x27;s analysis of &quot;Doctrine of the Mean&quot;, &quot;Doctrine of the Mean&quot; is an eclecticism which simultaneously opposes the abolishment of exploitation and excessive exploitation. According to Mao, &quot;Doctrine of the Mean&quot; failed to realize that something deserves absolute negation, and in compromise, &quot;Doctrine of the Mean&quot; prevented China from progress. In his comment, Mao said that the &quot;Doctrine of the Mean&quot; also goes against dialectics as it stops qualitative change by emphasizing balance and harmony, maintaining contradictions past the point where they can be abolished.

On another occasion, Mao cited the &quot;Doctrine of the Mean&quot;, stating, &quot;Being excessive is too left-leaning and being deficient means too right-leaning. We need to find an optimal status, which is what the &quot;Doctrine of the Mean&quot; suggests&quot; and that &quot;this thought is indeed a great discovery of Confucius [...] a great achievement, an important category of philosophy, and it deserves a good explanation.&quot;

Lu Xun, a leading figure of modern Chinese literature, saw &quot;Doctrine of the Mean&quot; as major contributing factor of the abject ethnic stereotype in modern China, believing it prevented reform from happening.

In his speech &quot;Silent China&quot;, Lu Xun said that Chinese likes the reconcilable and the compromised. &quot;For example, people will not allow you to add a window to a dark room, but when you threaten to uncover the roof, they would compromise to the idea of adding a window. Without a radical proposal pushing them, Chinese won&#x27;t permit even the mildest reform.&quot;

==Translation and study==
Andrew H. Plaks wrote the essay &quot;The mean, nature and self-realization. European translations of the &quot;Zhongyong&quot;&quot;, which was published in &quot;De l&#x27;un au multiple: Traductions du chinois vers les langues européenes&quot;. In his essay Plaks argues that since the text of the &quot;Doctrine of the Mean&quot; is &quot;too easy&quot;, this factor is, as paraphrased by Joshua A. Fogel, an author of a book review for the &quot;De l&#x27;un au multiple&quot; book &quot;The Journal of Asian Studies&quot;, a &quot;major impediment&quot; to translation.

The Tsinghua bamboo slips feature the text &quot;Bao xun&quot; (保訓) which shares the topos of centrality with the &quot;Zhongyong&quot;.

<text>Yuelu Mountain () is located on the west bank of the Xiang River, one tributary of Yangtze River in Yuelu District, Changsha, Hunan. Its main peak and the highest point, Yunlu Peak, is about above the sea level.

== Introduction of Yuelu Mountain==
There are more than 900 species of plants in Yuelu Mountain, and there are many ancient and famous trees, such as Podocarpus chinensis in the Jin Dynasty, ginkgo in the Tang Dynasty, camphor in the Song and Yuan Dynasties, and maple chestnut in the Ming and Qing Dynasties. Yuelu Mountain is also an area where Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism intersect each other (三教合流).

== Scenic Spots on Yuelu Mountain==
Yuelu Mountain is noted for its many scenic spots, including Qingfeng Gorge, Aiwan Pavilion, Lushan Temple, Yunlu Palace, the White Crane Spring, the Flying Stone and Yuelu Academy.

*Qingfeng Gorge lies in the low area between Yuelu Academy and Lushan Temple. It holds Aiwan Pavilion, one of four famous pavilions in ancient China, the Sheli Tower, and the tombs of Huang Xing (Huang Hsing) and Cai E (Tsai E).
*Autumn-Admiring Pavilion or Aiwan Pavilion and was built in A.D.1792. Its original name is Red Leaf Pavilion, later changed based on a poem by Du Mu.

<text>Anthony Traill (27 February 1939 – 27 April 2007) was a South African linguist, phonetician, and professor. He was the world&#x27;s foremost authority on !Xóõ, a Tuu language within the larger Khoisan category. He published widely on the language, including a dictionary.

Traill&#x27;s publications focused on the phonetics of !Xóõ in relation to other Khoisan languages. He also contributed importantly to the Khoisan and Bantu phonetic literature on tone with respect to voice and breathy voice.

Traill was Professorial Research Fellow at Wits University for nearly the decade since he was Professor and Chair of Linguistics (until 1998), in the Department of Linguistics, at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa. He spoke highly competent !Xóõ, having conducted research in the !Xóõ communities of Botswana on nearly 100 field trips over more than 35 years. He also spoke Zulu, Tsonga, Tswana and Afrikaans.

Traill developed a lump on his larynx after speaking the language for a long time, which is typical of adult native !Xóõ speakers, but not children, a testament to his time spent with the language.

After a long illness, Traill died on 27 April 2007, in Johannesburg, survived by his wife, Jill, and children Stephen, Carol and Patrick.

<doc id="426518" wikidata="Q820591" url="?curid=426518" title="The Story of a Shipwrecked Sailor">
<text>The Story of a Shipwrecked Sailor (original Spanish-language title: &quot;Relato de un náufrago&quot;) is a work of non-fiction by Colombian writer Gabriel García Márquez. The full title is The Story of a Shipwrecked Sailor: Who Drifted on a Liferaft for Ten Days Without Food or Water, Was Proclaimed a National Hero, Kissed by Beauty Queens, Made Rich Through Publicity, and Then Spurned by the Government and Forgotten for All Time ().

It was originally published as a fourteen consecutive day series of installments in &quot;El Espectador&quot; newspaper in 1955; it was later published as a book in 1970, and then translated into English by Randolph Hogan in 1986. The story is written in the first-person from the perspective of the sailor, 20-year-old Luis Alejandro Velasco, and was in fact signed by Velasco as author when it was first published in 1955. Not until 1970 when it was published as a book was García Márquez&#x27;s name first publicly associated with the story.

Nobel Prize in Literature laureate Gabriel García Márquez began his literary career as a newspaper writer. In 1955, he wrote a series of newspaper stories about a shipwrecked sailor who nearly died on account of negligence by the Colombian Navy; several of his colleagues drowned shortly before arriving at the port of Cartagena de Indias due to the existence of overweight contraband aboard the vessel. This resulted in public controversy, as it discredited the official account of the events, which had blamed a non-existent storm for the shipwreck and glorified the surviving sailor. As García Márquez subsequently became a sort of persona non grata for the government of General Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, he then worked for several years as a foreign correspondent.

The book&#x27;s theme is the possible, but not necessary, moral reversion to a primitive, instinctual existence in the face of a sea catastrophe and consequent shipwreck and solitude. This theme had been explored previously in fiction by Daniel Defoe (&quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; and the robinsonade genre) and Voltaire (&quot;Candide&quot;), and more recently by William Golding (&quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; and &quot;Pincher Martin&quot;), Umberto Eco (&quot;The Island of the Day Before&quot;), J. M. Coetzee (&quot;Foe&quot;), José Saramago (&quot;The Stone Raft&quot; and &quot;The Tale of the Unknown Island&quot;). A later non-fiction treatment of a similar theme can be found in &quot;The Last Strange Voyage of Donald Crowhurst&quot; by Ron Hall and Nicolas Tomalin.

==The story==

In February 1955, seaman Luis Alejandro Velasco of the destroyer &quot;Caldas&quot; is eager to return to Colombia after a long stay in the United States. When the ship sets sail, however, it is overloaded — in part with contraband. When the vessel is caught in heavy waves in the Caribbean, eight of the crew are washed overboard, together with much of the cargo. After four days the search ends, with the missing declared dead. However, Velasco found a raft and remained on the open sea without food and without hope. After drifting with sea currents for ten days, he arrives with his raft on a coast that he later discovers to be Colombia. He is received first with affection and later with military honors and much money from publicity agencies.

==Subject&#x27;s later life==

Luis Alejandro Velasco Rodríguez left the Navy and began to work in the private sector, starting with a job in a bus company. He eventually settled into work as a commercial agent in an insurance company in Bogotá. When Gabriel García Márquez published the story fifteen years later — in 1970 — in the book &quot;Relato de un Náufrago&quot;, he generously ceded the author&#x27;s rights and royalties to Velasco. In 1983, Velasco sued for translation rights to the book and lost. In the last week of his life, he apologized to García Márquez for the lawsuit. He died in Bogotá on August 2, 2000, aged 66.

<text>Carbonara () is a pasta dish made with fatty cured pork, hard cheese, eggs, salt, and black pepper. It is typical of the Lazio region of Italy. The dish took its modern form and name in the middle of the 20th century.

The cheese is usually . Some variations use Parmesan, Grana Padano, or a combination of cheeses. Spaghetti is the most common pasta, but bucatini or rigatoni are also used. While guanciale, a cured pork jowl, is traditional, some variations use pancetta, and lardons of smoked bacon are a common substitute outside Italy.

==Origin and history==
As with many recipes, the origins of the dish and its name are obscure; most sources trace its origin to the region of Lazio.

The dish forms part of a family of dishes consisting of pasta with cured pork, cheese, and pepper, one of which is . It is very similar to , a dish dressed with melted lard and a mixture of eggs and cheese, but not meat or pepper. is documented as far back as 1839 and, according to researchers, anecdotal evidence indicates that some Italians born before World War II associate that name with the dish now known as &quot;carbonara&quot;.

There are many theories for the origin of the name , which is probably more recent than the dish itself. There is no good evidence for any of them:
* Since the name is derived from , some people believe the dish was first made as a hearty meal for Italian charcoal workers. In parts of the United States, this etymology gave rise to the term &quot;coal miner&#x27;s spaghetti&quot;.
* John F. Mariani writes that some people believe it was created as a tribute to the Carbonari () secret society prominent in the early, repressed stages of Italian unification () in the early 19th century. 
* It seems more probable that it is an &quot;urban dish&quot; from Rome.

The names and are unrecorded before the Second World War; notably, it is absent from Ada Boni&#x27;s 1930 (). The 1931 edition of the Guide of Italy of the TCI describes a pasta () dish from Cascia and Monteleone di Spoleto, in Umbria, whose sauce contains whipped eggs, sausage, and pork fat and lean, which could be considered as a precursor of carbonara, although it does not contain any cheese.

The name first appears in print in 1950, when the Italian newspaper described it as a Roman dish sought out by American officers after the Allied liberation of Rome in 1944.

According to one hypothesis, a young Italian Army cook named Renato Gualandi created the dish in 1944, with other Italian cooks, as part of a dinner for the U.S. Army, because the Americans &quot;had fabulous bacon, very good cream, some cheese and powdered egg yolks&quot;.

Food writer Alan Davidson and food blogger and historian Luca Cesari have both stated that carbonara was born in Rome around 1944, just after the liberation of the city, probably because of the bacon that flowed in quantity with the U.S. Army. Cesari adds that the dish is mentioned in an Italian movie from 1951, while the first attested recipe is in an illustrated cookbook published in Chicago in 1952 by Patricia Bronté. According to Cesari, the recipe was probably brought to the United States by an American serviceman who had passed through Rome during the Italian campaign or by an Italian American who had met it in Rome; this makes carbonara a dish that closely links Italy and the United States, according to Cesari. The controversial Italian academic and professor Alberto Grandi also said that carbonara&#x27;s first attested recipe is American, citing Cesari, a claim that has been criticized in Italy. According to Grandi, the dish was created by Americans living in Italy after World War II.

In 1954, the first recipe for carbonara published in Italy appeared in magazine, although the recipe featured pancetta, garlic, and Gruyère cheese. The same year, carbonara was included in Elizabeth David&#x27;s &quot;Italian Food&quot;, an English-language cookbook published in Great Britain.

==Preparation==

The pasta is cooked in boiling water salted only moderately, due to the saltiness of the cured meat and the hard cheese. The meat is briefly fried in a pan in its own fat. A mixture of raw eggs (or yolks), grated cheese, and a liberal amount of ground black pepper is combined with the hot pasta either in the pasta pot or in a serving dish or bain-marie, but away from direct heat, to avoid curdling the egg. The fried meat is then added and the mixture is tossed, creating a rich, creamy sauce with bits of meat spread throughout. Various shapes of pasta can be used, almost always dried durum wheat pasta.

==Variations==
Guanciale is the most commonly used meat for the dish in Italy, but pancetta and are also used and, in English-speaking countries, bacon is often used as a substitute. The usual cheese is ; occasionally Parmesan, Grana Padano, or a combination of hard cheeses are used. Recipes differ as to which part of the egg is used—some use the whole egg, some others only the yolk, and still others a mixture. The amount of eggs used also vary, but the intended result is a creamy sauce from mild heating. For vegetarians, there are also recipes that utilize mushrooms and vegetables instead of meat.

Some preparations have more sauce and therefore use tubular pasta, such as penne, which is better suited to holding sauce. Cream is not used in most Italian recipes, with some notable exceptions from the 20th century. However, it is often employed in other countries, as adding cream makes the dish more stable. Similarly, garlic is found in some recipes, but mostly outside Italy. Outside Italy, variations on carbonara may include green peas, broccoli, tenderstem broccoli, leeks, onions, other vegetables or mushrooms, and may substitute a meat such as ham or for the fattier guanciale or pancetta.

A variant is , a seafood dish widespread in Lazio, Tuscany, particularly in Viareggio, and on the Riviera Romagnola.

===Halal or kosher versions===
Since neither guanciale nor bacon is allowed for Muslims and Jews, these are replaced in carbonara either by using a different type of meat (such as turkey bacon, jerky or biltong) that are not made from pork, and can be halal or kosher, or with non-meat alternatives (such as zucchini or mushrooms); thus the dish can become a halal or kosher variant.

==Sauce ==
A product described as carbonara sauce is sold as a ready-to-eat convenience food in grocery stores in many countries. Unlike the original preparation, which is inseparable from its dish as its creamy texture is created on the pasta itself, the ultra-processed versions of carbonara are prepared sauces to be applied onto separately cooked pasta. They may be thickened with cream and sometimes food starch, and often use bacon or cubed pancetta slices instead of guanciale.

<doc id="426524" wikidata="Q187173" url="?curid=426524" title="Thomas Wyatt the Younger">
<text>Sir Thomas Wyatt the Younger (152111 April 1554) was an English politician and rebel leader during the reign of Queen Mary I; his rising is traditionally called &quot;Wyatt&#x27;s rebellion&quot;. He was the son of the English poet and ambassador Sir Thomas Wyatt.

==Origins==
He was the son of the poet Sir Thomas Wyatt who introduced the sonnet into English literature. His mother was Elizabeth Brooke, a daughter of Thomas Brooke, 8th Baron Cobham, of Cobham Hall and Cooling Castle both in Kent, by his wife, Dorothy Heydon, a daughter of Sir Henry Heydon and Elizabeth (or Anne) Boleyn, a daughter of Sir Geoffrey Boleyn. He was the grandson of Sir Henry Wyatt and Anne Skinner, a daughter of John Skinner of Reigate, Surrey.

==Youth==

Born the eldest of four boys, Thomas Wyatt the Younger was raised a Roman Catholic. His godfather, Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk had a significant influence on Wyatt&#x27;s upbringing. Throughout his childhood, Thomas accompanied his father on a delegation to Spain where the Inquisition began. Subsequently, at the young age of sixteen, Thomas was married to Jane Haute.

At his father&#x27;s death in 1542, Thomas inherited Allington Castle and Boxley Abbey in Kent, but found both estates encumbered by debt. Further financial difficulties arose from the fact that, having been unfaithful to his wife (rumour had it that they were both unfaithful), the elder Wyatt separated from her. He had a child named Francis Darrell, whose mother was Elizabeth Darrell, an unmarried daughter of Sir Edward Darrell of Littlecote House in Wiltshire. The elder Sir Thomas left Elizabeth property in Dorset, thus diminishing his son&#x27;s inheritance. Nonetheless, the younger Thomas was evidently on friendly terms with his half-brother Francis, to whom he made a gift of his manor of Tarrant.

He was described as a young man of somewhat wild and impulsive temperament, and in 1543, along with other young noblemen, including Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, he was in trouble with the authorities for causing a serious public disturbance in London. In the autumn of 1543, Wyatt and Surrey joined a group of volunteers to take part in the Siege of Landrecies. Wyatt established himself as a prominent figure in the military and was praised by the professional soldier Thomas Churchyard. Next, Wyatt took part in the Siege of Boulogne with a responsible command. 

In 1547, he was elected Member of Parliament for Kent. In 1550, he was given the title of commissioner to delimit the English frontier in France but became ill and incapable of performing his duty. Later, Wyatt claimed to have assisted Queen Mary I against the Duke of Northumberland when the Duke claimed the throne for his daughter-in-law, Lady Jane Grey.

==Wyatt&#x27;s Rebellion==
Stemming from experiences with the Spanish Inquisition while accompanying his father, Wyatt developed an aversion to the Spanish government, which greatly affected him when he learned of Queen Mary&#x27;s decision to marry Philip of Spain. Thomas Wyatt viewed this decision as an injustice to the nation. According to Wyatt, he never planned on protesting against the Queen&#x27;s marriage until he was approached by Edward Courtenay, 1st Earl of Devon, who wished to prevent the Queen&#x27;s plan.
When the official marriage announcement was published on 15 January 1554, Wyatt and friends joined at Allington Castle to discuss plans of resistance. After several instigators were arrested, Wyatt became the leader of the rebellion. He then published a proclamation at Maidstone stating that his plan had been approved by &quot;dyvers of the best shire&quot;. People were told to secure the advancements of &quot;liberty and commonwealth&quot; which were being threatened by &quot;the Queen&#x27;s determinate pleasure to marry with a stranger&quot;.
Wyatt proved himself to be a responsible leader, earning the praise of the French ambassador, Antoine de Noailles. Soon, Wyatt was responsible for commanding 1,500 men. He set up his command headquarters in Rochester on 26 January.

Shortly after he had established his headquarters, Queen Mary was informed of Wyatt&#x27;s plan. The Queen offered a pardon to followers of Wyatt who retreated peacefully to their homes within twenty-four hours. Despite this, Thomas Wyatt encouraged his followers to stay by falsely announcing imminent support from France and victorious uprisings in other areas. He was given a surprising advantage when the government instructed the Duke of Norfolk to approach Wyatt and his forces. The Duke&#x27;s forces were inferior to Wyatt and the rebels. When the Duke came into contact with Wyatt, many of his own men joined the rebellion, which led the Duke to flee to Gravesend.

Following these events, Wyatt and the four thousand men who accompanied him marched through Gravesend and Dartford to Blackheath in January 1553/54. Stow (1598) wrote: &quot;in the year 1553, the 3rd February, Sir Thomas Wyat and the Kentish men marched from Depeford towards London... the draw-bridge was cut down, and the bridge gates shut.&quot;

The government addressed this issue with great seriousness. In an effort to gain time, the government offered Wyatt an opportunity to establish demands; however, this was only a formality. By this point, Wyatt had been deemed a disloyal adversary in the eyes of the monarchy. On 2 February 1554, over twenty thousand men volunteered to aid the Queen as defenders against Wyatt and his troops. In addition to these precautions, other security measures were also taken. The court and the Tower of London were under especially heavy guard. Furthermore, a lucrative reward was offered in exchange for Wyatt&#x27;s capture: a valuable sum of land would be awarded to anyone who handed Wyatt over as a captive.

During the negotiation, Wyatt had insisted that the Tower should be surrendered to him, and the queen put in his charge. Although the reformers in London had at first been in sympathy with him, these demands caused a negative reaction. Upon entering Southwark, Wyatt and his companions soon discovered the high-security measures that had been implemented, and that London Bridge was fortified. As a result, many of his followers abandoned him, forcing him to leave Southwark. He instead headed towards Kingston-on-Thames, with new plans to surprise Ludgate and intentions to capture the Queen&#x27;s refuge in St James&#x27;s Palace. The government soon found out about his strategy, and responded by allowing him to progress into the city, only to corner him from all sides. After several skirmishes along the way, with the numbers of his followers dwindling continually, Wyatt eventually admitted defeat. He was arrested and taken to the Tower of London. On 15 March, after a trial which was little more than a formality, he was sentenced to death for high treason. Sentence was delayed in hopes that he would place some blame on Mary&#x27;s half-sister Elizabeth, but he did not confess enough to put her in danger.

==Execution==
On 11 April 1554, the scheduled date of his execution, Wyatt asked permission of John Brydges, 1st Baron Chandos, the Lieutenant of the Tower of London, to speak to Edward Courtenay, the Earl of Devon. 

During their half-hour-long meeting, Wyatt knelt down before Courtenay and begged him &quot;to confess the truth of himself&quot;, as Wyatt believed Courtenay was the original instigator of the crime. However, when on the scaffold, Wyatt confessed his own blame and was determined to exculpate Princess Elizabeth and Courtenay. After Wyatt was beheaded, his body was further punished according to the standards of treason. His head, before it was stolen on 17 April, was hung from a gallows. His limbs were then circulated among towns and also hung up for display.

==Marriage and issue==
In 1537, Wyatt married Jane Haute, the daughter of Sir William Haute (died 1539) of Bishopsbourne, Kent, by Mary, the daughter of Sir Richard Guildford. They had six sons, George, Francis, Richard, Charles, Arthur and Henry, and four daughters, Joyce, Ursula, Anne, and Jane. 

Three of their children married and continued the lineage. Anne married Roger Twysden, whose grandson was Sir Roger Twysden. Sir Roger inherited Wyatt the Younger&#x27;s son George Wyatt&#x27;s manuscript on Anne Boleyn&#x27;s life, entitled &quot;Extracts from the Life of Queen Anne Boleigne, by George Wyat. Written at the close of the XVIth century.&quot;

His estates were afterwards partly restored to his son, George. George&#x27;s son, Sir Francis Wyatt (died 1644), was governor of Virginia in 1621–26 and 1639–42.

A great-grandson of note was explorer and interpreter, Captain Henry Fleete of Maryland and Virginia.

<doc id="426530" wikidata="Q2087641" url="?curid=426530" title="Clarenville">
<text>Clarenville is a town on the east coast of Newfoundland in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. Clarenville was incorporated in 1951. It is located in the Shoal Harbour valley, fronting an arm of the Atlantic Ocean called Random Sound.

The town grew in importance after it became a junction on the Newfoundland Railway, where a branch line to the Bonavista Peninsula left the main line. The construction of the Trans-Canada Highway through the community in the 1960s resulted in it becoming a local service centre for central-eastern Newfoundland, serving 96,000 people living in 90 communities within a 100 km radius. Clarenville is centrally located and within two hours&#x27; driving time of 70% of the province&#x27;s population.

The town is a natural gateway to the Discovery Trail, extending down the Bonavista Peninsula to Trinity and Bonavista, reputed site of the first landing of European explorer John Cabot. The trail is a panorama of scenery, historic sites, coastal towns and villages.

TAT-1 (the first transatlantic telephone cable) was laid between Clarenville and Gallanach Bay, Oban between 1955 and 1956 by the cable ship &quot;Monarch&quot;.

==Geography==

Clarenville is near the centre of three peninsulas: Avalon, Burin, and Bonavista. Route 1 (the Trans-Canada Highway) and Route 230 pass through the town, linking Clarenville to the Bonavista Bay area and to the rest of the provincial road network.

The Clarenville area has many of the physical features characteristic of the East Coast of Newfoundland and has a marine climate. It lies along the coastal slopes which rise from the Atlantic Ocean towards the interior central plateau of the island. The dominating physical feature is a ridge of broken peaks which rise to heights up to 152 meters above sea level parallel to the coast line. Bare Mountain, with an elevation of 156 meters above sea level, dominates the skyline in the northern part of the town. This ridge falls sharply towards the sea so that its coastal edge is characterized by moderate to severe slopes.

Towards the southern part of Clarenville, the ridge is broken by a series of valleys which have cut their way through from the coast. The most notable of these is the valley formed by the Lower Shoal Harbour River and Dark Hole Brook and their seaward extension of Lower Shoal Harbour, a shallow and narrow indentation of the sea marked by small rock islands and tidal mud flats. The flats surrounding the river are marshy and subjected to flooding during spring runoff. The river serves as the main drainage course for the area behind the coastal ridge.

Clarenville has developed in a narrow strip between the coastal ridge and the sea. The average width of the corridor is between 450 and 600 meters. Located at the most westerly end of an in-drift called Random Sound, extending 25 km inland behind Random Island. As probably the deepest, best sheltered, ice-free port on Newfoundland&#x27;s east coast, Clarenville is suited for commercial shipping and recreational boating.

==History==
There is no definite date for the first settlement of what is now Clarenville. William Cowan owned a sawmill at Lower Shoal Harbour around 1848 and this was bought by Joseph Tilley and James Summers of Hants Harbour. They settled here. Settlers also arrived at Dark Hole (or Dark Harbour). The families that made up this community were the Balsoms, Pearces, Vardys, and Seawards. Settlers also arrived at Brook Cove (the Burseys), Broad Cove (the Strongs, Adeys), and Red Beach (the Stanleys). These five communities became part of a new community known as Clarenceville in 1892 when the railway came through.
There are two versions of the origin of Clarenville&#x27;s name. It has been attributed to a memorial to the Duke of Clarence, eldest son of the then Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) who died in 1892. The other version is that it was named for a son of Premier Sir William Whiteway. However, Whiteway had no son by that name. By 1901, Clarenville was the way everyone spelled the name and it has remained that way.

John Tilley and his family were the first settlers of Lower Shoal Harbour. They traveled from Hants Harbour in 1848 because of the abundance of timber here. Many referred to him as &quot;Scholar John&quot;, as he had taught himself how to read and write. As a young man, he married Elizabeth Bursey of Old Perlican and they had four sons and six daughters. Being one of the earliest Justices of the Peace licensed to perform marriages in Newfoundland, John Tilley performed the marriage of his own daughter. Church records show that Tilley&#x27;s name appears several times in the late 1830s and 1840s, when there was apparently no minister or missionary available. When the Tilleys arrived, the first thing they had to do was build a log cottage which would be a temporary structure. They later built a saw mill so they could build a standard-size home. Along with the saw mill, the Tilleys became involved with fox farming, gardening, coopering, blacksmithing, fishing and fish canning. John Tilley and Sons were the first tinning operation to tin salmon in Newfoundland (the first salmon was tinned by Tilley and Sons). Shortly after Scholar John tinned his first salmon he learned of a fishery exhibition. He sent a sample to the exhibition and received a prize in the form of a bronze medal with the inscription: &quot;Warranted to keep free from taint and to retain its purity and nutritious quality, in any climate for many years.&quot; Later, Scholar John and his sons Aaron and Moses Tilley, with help from John&#x27;s son-in-law David Palmer, built the first church in Shoal Harbour.

In 1993, Clarenville and Shoal Harbour were amalgamated.

==Recreation==

Clarenville held the 1994 Newfoundland Winter Games and the 1997 National Under 17 Men&#x27;s Softball Tournament. In November 2010, the town also hosted two games of the Four Nations Cup. Clarenville has recreational facilities including a health club with an indoor pool, three softball diamonds (one lit by night), a soccer pitch with a running track, and a recreation complex with three regulation size volleyball courts. The newly constructed Clarenville Events Centre includes a theatre, a rink for hockey, figure skating and curling, and is home to the Clarenville Caribous. Nearby are three golf courses, hiking trails, snowmobiling country. Clarenville has the only ski resort east of Corner Brook, called White Hills Ski Resort. White Hills is also home to The New Curtain Theatre Company at The Loft Theatre.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Clarenville had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<text>Bonnaroo (or Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival) is an American annual four-day music festival developed and founded by Superfly Presents and AC Entertainment. Since its first year in 2002, it has been held at what is now Great Stage Park on a farm in Manchester, Tennessee. The festival typically starts on the second Thursday in June and lasts four days. It has been held every year except in 2020, when it was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic and in 2021 when it was canceled due to excessive rain from Hurricane Ida flooding the campground. The main attractions of this festival are the multiple stages featuring live music with a diverse array of musical styles including indie rock, classic rock, world music, hip hop, jazz, Americana, bluegrass, country music, folk, gospel, reggae, pop, electronic, and other alternative music. Musical acts begin Wednesday evening for early arrivals, continue throughout the festival, with performances starting each day around noon, and some stages entertaining festival goers until sunrise.

The festival was ranked in 2003 by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine as one of the &quot;50 Moments That Changed Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, &quot;Festival of the Decade&quot; by &quot;Consequence of Sound,&quot; and among the 10 Best Festivals by &quot;GQ Magazine&quot;. The 2021 edition has been listed on Funktasy Magazine&#x27;s Best Music Festivals.

==History==
Ashley Capps, co-founder of AC Entertainment, developed Bonnaroo following the cancellation of the Hot Summer Nights rock music festival in Knoxville, Tennessee in 1999. Hot Summer Nights, which was a mainstay in Knoxville&#x27;s World&#x27;s Fair Park would suspend operations permanently following construction by city officials. Capps would state that the cancellation would be the main drive behind the origin of Bonnaroo, &quot;The closing of the World&#x27;s Fair Park for concerts precipitated getting creative and trying to find, &#x27;OK, if we can&#x27;t do this anymore, how can we still participate in the summer outdoor concert business,&#x27; and it was from that that Bonnaroo was ultimately launched.&quot;

In 1999, the future site of Bonnaroo hosted the Itchycoo Park Festival (named after the song Itchycoo Park by Small Faces), which is considered the spiritual predecessor to the original Bonaroo music festival. Unlike Bonnaroo, the Itchycoo Park Festival was considered an overall failure. The first Bonnaroo Music Festival took place in 2002. The founders chose &quot;bonnaroo&quot; (Creole slang meaning a really good time) for its literal meaning and to honor the rich New Orleans music tradition that they had enjoyed in college. Bonnaroo was popularized by New Orleans R&amp;B singer Dr. John with his 1974 album &quot;Desitively Bonnaroo.&quot; Bonnaroo is derived from the French &quot;bonne&quot; the feminine agreement of &quot;bon&quot; meaning &quot;good&quot;, and the French &quot;rue&quot; meaning &quot;street&quot;, translating roughly to &quot;the best on the streets&quot;. The festival site is known as &quot;the farm&quot; by festival goers and locals, due to its location on what used to be 700 acres of farm land.

In 2019, after a record breaking festival sell out, it was announced that Live Nation was buying out Superfly&#x27;s share of Bonnaroo.

The 2020 event was initially pushed back three months until September 2020, and then ultimately cancelled because of health concerns surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The 2021 event was canceled due to torrential rainfall from Hurricane Ida saturating the stage area, campgrounds, and tollbooth area, and making ground conditions unsuitable for vehicle traffic only a few days before the event was scheduled to take place.

Hulu has exclusively streamed the festival from 2022 to 2024, alongside Austin City Limits Music Festival and Lollapalooza.

==Economy==
In 2009 the Bonnaroo Works Fund was created as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization for the festival. The organization awards grants to local non-profits and schools.

By 2013, the direct and indirect economic impact of the festival since its inception was estimated at $51 million, including $2.9 million in tax revenue for the year 2012.

In 2023, Bonnaroo contributed $339.8 million to the regional economy (including over $5.1 million in tax revenue), and created or supported 4,163 full-time job equivalents.

==Environmentalism==
Bonnaroo actively supports recycling and sustainability. In 2011, A Greener Festival recognized Bonnaroo&#x27;s efforts for the previous three years with an award. In 2004 Bonnaroo said it prevented having to collect 120 tons of trash by encouraging fans to recycle. Food and drink are sold in organic and recyclable materials to create less waste. AGF auditors review festivals, as well as requiring their self-evaluation. As of late, Bonnaroo has initiated many &quot;green&quot; activities during the festival, such as Planet Roo.

==Reception==
When the festival began in 2002, &quot;USA Today&quot; referred to Bonnaroo as &quot;the culmination of a musical movement.&quot; CNN described it as &quot;music and subculture melted together into a pot of creative bubbling energy.&quot;

In 2008, it was named &quot;Best Festival&quot; by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, calling it &quot;the ultimate over-the-top summer festival&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said &quot;Bonnaroo has revolutionized the modern rock festival&quot; in 2012, &quot;Spin&quot; called it the &quot;best festival of the summer&quot;, and the Grammy&#x27;s have deemed it &quot;the pinnacle of summer music festivals&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; named Bonnaroo the 8th best music festival in 2022.

Bonnaroo has been referred to as &quot;the Glastonbury Festival of the United States&quot;, due to comparisons with the massive British festival, including the necessity of camping, the communal vibes of the attendees, and the large farm grounds it takes place on.

==Venues==
Bonnaroo has various stages in the venue area (called &quot;Centeroo&quot;) and in the campground area (called &quot;Outeroo&quot;). Centeroo stages include the What Stage, Which Stage, That Tent, This Tent, and The Other Stage (previously &quot;The Other Tent&quot;, but changed to a full stage to accommodate the growth of EDM at the festival). Outeroo stages in the campgrounds vary year-to-year, but has included a Where in the Woods Stage since 2018, which exclusively offers electronic music shows during late night hours. The biggest stage that headliners appear on, the What Stage, can accommodate up to 80,000 fans.

==Notable performances==
R&amp;B singer D&#x27;Angelo marked his return to American stages for the first time in over 12 years on June 9, 2012, with a surprise performance at the festival&#x27;s annual Superjam. He was backed by members of the R&amp;B collective the Soulquarians, most notably Questlove, James Poyser and Pino Palladino, with guest guitarist Jesse Johnson. The set was composed almost entirely of covers.

In 2009, Beastie Boys played their final ever show at the festival.

Other performers have included Widespread Panic (2002, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2011), Phish (2009, 2012, 2019), The Dead (2003, 2004), Dead &amp; Company (2016), U2 (2017), Pearl Jam (2008, 2016), Billy Joel (2015), Mumford &amp; Sons (2011, 2015), Elton John (2014), Eminem (2011, 2018), Jack White (2010, 2014), Lionel Richie (2014), the Flaming Lips (2003, 2007, 2010, 2014), Paul McCartney (2013), Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers (2006, 2013), Wu-Tang Clan (2013), Red Hot Chili Peppers (2012, 2017, 2024), Radiohead (2006, 2012), Neil Young (2003, 2011), Dave Matthews Band (2005, 2010), Stevie Wonder (2010), Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band (2009), Nine Inch Nails (2009), Metallica (2008), the Police (2007), Tool (2007, 2022), and Bob Dylan (2004).

== Activities ==

In addition to music, Bonnaroo used to offer comedy and cinema in a dedicated tent, but the tent was removed in 2018.

Currently, Bonnaroo offers a plethora of various artistic, environmental, and community activities throughout the weekend in both Centeroo and Outeroo. These activities include parades, dance shows, yoga, sustainability lessons, a 5k run, a marriage barn, a water slide, vendor markets, and more.

<doc id="426533" wikidata="Q4680729" url="?curid=426533" title="Adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack">
<text>An adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack (abbreviated as CCA2) is an interactive form of chosen-ciphertext attack in which an attacker first sends a number of ciphertexts to be decrypted chosen adaptively, and then uses the results to distinguish a target ciphertext without consulting the oracle on the challenge ciphertext. In an adaptive attack, the attacker is further allowed adaptive queries to be asked after the target is revealed (but the target query is disallowed). It is extending the indifferent (non-adaptive) chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA1) where the second stage of adaptive queries is not allowed. Charles Rackoff and Dan Simon defined CCA2 and suggested a system building on the non-adaptive CCA1 definition and system of Moni Naor and Moti Yung (which was the first treatment of chosen ciphertext attack immunity of public key systems).

In certain practical settings, the goal of this attack is to gradually reveal information about an encrypted message, or about the decryption key itself. For public-key systems, adaptive-chosen-ciphertexts are generally applicable only when they have the property of ciphertext malleability — that is, a ciphertext can be modified in specific ways that will have a predictable effect on the decryption of that message.

==Practical attacks==
Adaptive-chosen-ciphertext attacks were perhaps considered to be a theoretical concern, but not to have been be manifested in practice, until 1998, when Daniel Bleichenbacher (then of Bell Laboratories) demonstrated a practical attack against systems using RSA encryption in concert with the PKCS#1 v1.5 encoding function, including a version of the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol used by thousands of web servers at the time.

The Bleichenbacher attacks, also known as the million message attack, took advantage of flaws within the PKCS #1 v1.5 padding function to gradually reveal the content of an RSA encrypted message. Under this padding function, padded plaintexts have a fixed format that it should follow. If the decryption device (e.g. SSL-equipped web server) somehow reveals whether the padding is valid, it also serves as an &quot;oracle&quot; that reveals information on the secret key. Finding the whole key requires sending several million test ciphertexts to the target. In practical terms, this means that an SSL session key can be exposed in a reasonable amount of time, perhaps a day or less.

With slight variations, this vulnerability still exists in many modern servers, under the new name &quot;Return Of Bleichenbacher&#x27;s Oracle Threat&quot; (ROBOT).

==Preventing attacks==
In order to prevent adaptive-chosen-ciphertext attacks, it is necessary to use an encryption or encoding scheme that limits ciphertext malleability and a proof of security of the system. After the theoretical and foundation level development of CCA secure systems, a number of systems have been proposed in the Random Oracle model: the most common standard for RSA encryption is Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (OAEP). Unlike improvised schemes such as the padding used in the early versions of PKCS#1, OAEP has been proven secure in the random oracle model, OAEP was incorporated into PKCS#1 as of version 2.0 published in 1998 as the now-recommended encoding scheme, with the older scheme still supported but not recommended for new applications. However, the golden standard for security is to show the system secure without relying on the Random Oracle idealization.

==Mathematical model==
In complexity-theoretic cryptography, security against adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks is commonly modeled using ciphertext indistinguishability (IND-CCA2).

<text>Trade negotiators generally refer to Article 13 of the World Trade Organization&#x27;s Agreement on Agriculture as the Peace Clause. Article 13 holds that domestic support measures and export subsidies of a WTO member that are legal under the Agreement on Agriculture cannot be challenged by other WTO members on grounds of being illegal under the provisions of another WTO agreement.

The Peace Clause expired on January 1, 2004. It is now possible, therefore, for developing countries and nations favoring free trade in agricultural goods, such as the Cairns Group, to use the WTO dispute settlement mechanism in order to challenge, in particular, U.S. and EU export subsidies on agricultural products.

Another temporary peace clause was made at the WTO Bali conference in December 2013. It stipulated that no country would be legally barred from food security programs for its own people even if the subsidy breached the limits specified in the WTO Agreement on Agriculture.

<doc id="426551" wikidata="Q3546880" url="?curid=426551" title="Heronian tetrahedron">
<text>A Heronian tetrahedron (also called a Heron tetrahedron or perfect pyramid) is a tetrahedron whose edge lengths, face areas and volume are all integers. The faces must therefore all be Heronian triangles (named for Hero of Alexandria).
Every Heronian tetrahedron can be arranged in Euclidean space so that its vertex coordinates are also integers.

==Examples==
An example known to Leonhard Euler is a Heronian birectangular tetrahedron, a tetrahedron with a path of three edges parallel to the three coordinate axes and with all faces being right triangles. The lengths of the edges on the path of axis-parallel edges are 153, 104, and 672, and the other three edge lengths are 185, 680, and 697, forming four right triangle faces described by the Pythagorean triples (153,104,185), (104,672,680), (153,680,697), and (185,672,697).

Eight examples of Heronian tetrahedra were discovered in 1877 by Reinhold Hoppe.

117 is the smallest possible length of the longest edge of a perfect tetrahedron with integral edge lengths. Its other edge lengths are 51, 52, 53, 80 and 84. 8064 is the smallest possible volume (and 6384 is the smallest possible surface area) of a perfect tetrahedron. The integral edge lengths of a Heronian tetrahedron with this volume and surface area are 25, 39, 56, 120, 153 and 160.

In 1943, E. P. Starke published another example, in which two faces are isosceles triangles with base 896 and sides 1073, and the other two faces are also isosceles with base 990 and the same sides. However, Starke made an error in reporting its volume which has become widely copied. The correct volume is , twice the number reported by Starke.

Sascha Kurz has used computer search algorithms to find all Heronian tetrahedra with longest edge length at most .

==Classification, infinite families, and special types of tetrahedron==
A regular tetrahedron (one with all faces being equilateral) cannot be a Heronian tetrahedron because, for regular tetrahedra whose edge lengths are integers, the face areas and volume are irrational numbers. For the same reason no Heronian tetrahedron can have an equilateral triangle as one of its faces.

There are infinitely many Heronian tetrahedra, and more strongly infinitely many Heronian disphenoids, tetrahedra in which all faces are congruent and each pair of opposite sides has equal lengths. In this case, there are only three edge lengths needed to describe the tetrahedron, rather than six, and the triples of lengths that define Heronian tetrahedra can be characterized using an elliptic curve. There are also infinitely many Heronian tetrahedra with a cycle of four equal edge lengths, in which all faces are isosceles triangles.

There are also infinitely many Heronian birectangular tetrahedra. One method for generating tetrahedra of this type derives the axis-parallel edge lengths formula_1, formula_2, and formula_3 from two equal sums of fourth powers
:formula_4
using the formulas
:formula_5
:formula_6
:formula_7
For instance, the tetrahedron derived in this way from an identity of Leonhard Euler, formula_8, has formula_1, formula_2, and formula_3 equal to , , and , with the hypotenuse of right triangle formula_12 equal to , the hypotenuse of right triangle formula_13 equal to , and the hypotenuse of the remaining two sides equal to . For these tetrahedra, formula_1, formula_2, and formula_3 form the edge lengths of an almost-perfect cuboid, a rectangular cuboid in which the sides, two of the three face diagonals, and the body diagonal are all integers.

No example of a Heronian trirectangular tetrahedron had been found and no one has proven that none exist.

A complete classification of all Heronian tetrahedra remains unknown.

==Related shapes==
An alternative definition of Heronian triangles is that they can be formed by gluing together two integer right triangles along a common side.
This definition has also been generalized to three dimensions, leading to a different class of tetrahedra that have also been called Heron tetrahedra.
