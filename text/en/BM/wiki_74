<text>After the 1948 takeover of power, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (&quot;KSČ&quot;) formed two Soviet-style youth organizations: the Pionýr (Pioneers, for youngsters eight to fifteen years old) and the Czechoslovak Union of Youth (ČSM, ages fifteen to twenty-five). Both organizations were geared toward grooming their members (or a fortunate fraction of them) for KSČ membership.

By the late 1960s, some 70% of all those eligible were members of the Pionýr; the reform movement revealed, however, a number of points of dissatisfaction. Czechoslovak adherence to the Soviet model extended to uniform dress (white shirts and red kerchiefs) and salutes, neither of which was popular among Czechs and Slovaks. In addition, the Pioneer leadership was often less than devoted. In 1968, when the organization became voluntary, the number of leaders dropped precipitously; the resulting shortage persisted through the 1980s.

The Czechoslovak Union of Youth had a tumultuous history during the late 1960s and 1970s. As a feeder organization for the KSČ, it faced many of the same problems the party faced in recruiting members. In the mid-1960s, less than half of all 15- to 25-year-olds were members; in the mid-1970s, fewer than one-third had joined. As in the case of the KSČ, those who joined tended to do so with their future careers in mind; secondary school and university students were overrepresented, while only a fraction of the eligible industrial and agricultural workers belonged. Furthermore, a single, centralized organization was simply an inadequate vehicle for the interests of such a diverse group. During the reform era, the Czechoslovak Union of Youth split into a number of independent associations, including the Union of High School Students and Apprentices, the Union of Working Youth, and the Union of University Students. It was not a development the party found suitable, and beginning in 1969 party leaders set about reconstituting a unified movement. During the same era, the 1968 invasion spawned a number of dissident youth organizations. In the early 1970s, these were all infiltrated and repressed by the KSČ, a policy that continued throughout the 1980s.

In 1970 the party organized the Czechoslovak Socialist Youth Union (SSM), and by mid-decade the skewed recruitment pattern of its predecessor, the Czechoslovak Union of Youth, which had recruited more students than workers, had reappeared. The recruitment effort had been more intense than ever. &quot;I know of only two types of students at this institution,&quot; commented one teacher, &quot;those who will not graduate and those who are members of the Czechoslovak Socialist Union of Youth.&quot; The nets had been cast so widely that, not surprisingly, some members were unenthusiastic. Throughout the 1970s, there were complaints about the organization&#x27;s propensity to take any and all joiners (even &quot;beatniks,&quot; one writer complained), the association&#x27;s apolitical and recreational focus, and a membership bent more on securing admission to a university than learning &quot;the principles of socialist patriotism.&quot;

In 1983 the Czechoslovak Socialist Union of Youth had a total membership of over 1.5 million. Twenty-five percent of the members were listed as workers, 3% as agricultural workers, and 72% as &quot;others&quot;. Over the time the membership in Pionýr and SSM became more-less a formal duty; most of the members ignored actions organized by the Union and many local groups existed only on the paper.

There was also the Svazarm, a paramilitary, Scouting type organisations that readied Czechoslovak youths for military training. It was very similar to the Soviet Union&#x27;s DOSAAF.

The communist takeover also affected independent youth organisations. In 1946 a newly formed international organisation &quot;Association Internationale des Etudiants en Sciences Economiques&quot; (AIESE) was first headquartered in Prague, but had to leave the country in order to stay politically neutral after the communists gained power. The organisation re-entered Czechoslovakia in 1966 and later became a member of the Socialistic Youth Union as an affiliated body of AIESEC.

<text>The Wii ( ) is a home video game console developed and marketed by Nintendo. It was released on November 19, 2006, in North America, and in December 2006 for most other regions of the world. It is Nintendo&#x27;s fifth major home game console, following the GameCube, and is a seventh-generation console alongside Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox 360 and Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 3.

In developing the Wii, Nintendo president Satoru Iwata directed the company to avoid competing with Microsoft and Sony on computational graphics and power and instead to target a broader demographic of players through novel gameplay. Game designers Shigeru Miyamoto and Genyo Takeda led the console&#x27;s development under the codename Revolution. The primary controller for the Wii is the Wii Remote, a wireless controller with both motion sensing and traditional controls which can be used as a pointing device towards the television screen or for gesture recognition. The Wii was Nintendo&#x27;s first home console to directly support Internet connectivity, supporting both online games and for digital distribution of games and media applications through the Wii Shop Channel. The Wii also supports wireless connectivity with the Nintendo DS handheld console for selected games. Initial Wii models included full backward compatibility support for GameCube games and most of the console&#x27;s accessories. Later in its lifecycle, two lower-cost Wii models were produced: a revised model with the same design as the original Wii but without the GameCube compatibility features, and the Wii Mini, a compact, budget redesign of the Wii which further removed several features, including online connectivity and SD card storage.

Because of Nintendo&#x27;s reduced focus on computational power, the Wii and its games were less expensive to produce than its competitors. The Wii was extremely popular at launch, causing the system to be in short supply in some markets. A bundled game, &quot;Wii Sports&quot;, was considered the killer app for the console; other flagship games included entries in the &quot;Super Mario&quot;, &quot;Legend of Zelda&quot;, &quot;Pokémon&quot;, and &quot;Metroid&quot; series. Within a year of launch, the Wii became the best-selling seventh-generation console as well as a social phenomenon in many countries. Total lifetime sales of the Wii had reached over 101 million units, making it Nintendo&#x27;s best-selling home console until it was surpassed by the Nintendo Switch in 2021. As of 2022, the Wii is the fifth-best-selling home console of all time.

The Wii repositioned Nintendo as a key player in the video game console marketplace. The introduction of motion-controlled games via the Wii Remote led both Microsoft and Sony to develop their own competing products—the Kinect and PlayStation Move, respectively. Nintendo found that, while the Wii had broadened the demographics that they wanted, the core gamer audience had shunned the Wii. The Wii&#x27;s successor, the Wii U, sought to recapture the core gamer market with additional features atop the Wii. The Wii U was released in 2012, and Nintendo continued to sell both units through the following year. The Wii was formally discontinued in October 2013, though Nintendo continued to produce and market the Wii Mini for a few years afterwards, and offered a subset of the Wii&#x27;s online services through 2019.

== History ==
=== 2001–2003: Development ===

Shortly after the release of the GameCube, Nintendo began conceptualizing their next console. The company&#x27;s game designer Shigeru Miyamoto said that, in the early stages, they decided they would not aim to compete on hardware power, and would instead prioritize new gameplay concepts. The console was firstly named &quot;GameCube Next&quot; as a placeholder. The price of the new console was originally envisioned to be as low as 100 euros but the NAND flash memory desired by Satoru Iwata would force that price to slightly more than the double.

Miyamoto cited &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot;&#x27;s unique game controllers as inspiration for developing new input devices. Later on September 24, 2001, Nintendo began working with Gyration Inc., a firm that had developed several patents related to motion detection, to prototype future controllers using their licensed patents.

Over the next two years, sales of the GameCube languished behind its competitors—Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 2 and Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox. Satoru Iwata, who had been promoted to Nintendo&#x27;s president in May 2002 following Hiroshi Yamauchi&#x27;s retirement, recognized that Nintendo had not been keeping up with trends in the video game industry, such as adapting to online gaming. He also thought that video gaming had become too exclusive and wanted Nintendo to pursue gaming hardware and software that would appeal to all demographics. Nintendo&#x27;s market analysis found that their focus on novel hardware had created consoles that made it difficult for third-party developers to create games for, hampering their position. One of the first major steps Iwata had made based on the company&#x27;s research was directing the development of the Nintendo DS, a handheld incorporating dual screens including a touchscreen, to revitalize their handheld console line.
In 2003, Iwata met with Miyamoto and Genyo Takeda to discuss their market research. Iwata instructed Takeda &quot;to go off the tech roadmap&quot; for this console, but said it had to be appealing to mothers. Iwata wanted their next console to be capable of playing past Nintendo games, eliminating clutter in houses. Takeda led the team building the console&#x27;s hardware components, and Miyamoto spearheaded the development of a new type of controller, based on Gyration&#x27;s motion-sensing technology. Iwata had proposed that this new console use motion sensing to simplify the gaming interface, increasing appeal to all audiences. An initial prototype was completed within six months.
The Nintendo DS was said to have influenced the Wii&#x27;s design, as the company found that the DS&#x27;s novel two-screen interface had drawn in non-traditional players and wanted to replicate that on the new console. Designer Ken&#x27;ichiro Ashida noted, &quot;We had the DS on our minds as we worked on the Wii. We thought about copying the DS&#x27;s touch-panel interface and even came up with a prototype.&quot; The idea was eventually rejected because of the notion that the two gaming systems would be identical. Miyamoto also stated, &quot;if the DS had flopped, we might have taken the Wii back to the drawing board.&quot;

=== 2004–2005: Announcements ===
Prior to E3 2004, Iwata had referred to Nintendo&#x27;s upcoming console offering as the GameCube Next (GCNext or GCN). Iwata first unveiled some details of Nintendo&#x27;s new home console at E3 2004 under the codename &quot;Revolution&quot;, as Iwata believed the console would revolutionize the gaming industry. BBC News&#x27; technology editor Alfred Hermida wrote that Nintendo&#x27;s struggle to match Sony and Microsoft in the home console market made success crucial.

The console, still named &quot;Revolution&quot;, was formally presented to the public at E3 2005. The motion controller interface had not yet been completed and was omitted from the unveiling. Iwata held the console above him with one hand to emphasize its size relative to its rivals. A smaller device meant it would draw on less power as to not overheat, and thus appealed to parents who were willing to have an attractive, small, power-efficient device in the living room. Iwata reportedly used a stack of three DVD cases as a size guide. The prototype held by Iwata was black, but at release the following year, the console was only available in white. In their book on the console, two Loyola University Chicago professors suggested that Nintendo was inviting comparisons with Apple&#x27;s first iPod line.

Iwata later unveiled and demonstrated their current prototype of the Revolution controller at the Tokyo Game Show in September 2005. At this stage, the controller unit resembled the final Wii Remote device along with the separate Nunchuk attachment. Iwata demonstrated its motion sensing gameplay capabilities, and incorporated commentary from developers, such as Hideo Kojima and Yuji Horii, who had tested the controller and believed people would be drawn in by it.

The console&#x27;s name was formally announced as the Wii in April 2006, a month prior to E3 2006. Nintendo&#x27;s spelling of &quot;Wii&quot; (with two lower-case &quot;i&quot; characters) was intended to represent both two people standing side by side, and the Wii Remote and its Nunchuk. In the company&#x27;s announcement, they stated: &quot;Wii sounds like &#x27;we&#x27;, which emphasizes that the console is for everyone. Wii can easily be remembered by people around the world, no matter what language they speak. No confusion.&quot;

The name resulted in criticism and mockery. &quot;Forbes&quot; expressed a fear that the console would be seen as juvenile. BBC News reported the day after the name was announced that &quot;a long list of puerile jokes, based on the name,&quot; had appeared on the Internet. Some video game developers and members of the press stated that they preferred &quot;Revolution&quot; over &quot;Wii&quot;. Nintendo of America&#x27;s Vice President of Corporate Affairs Perrin Kaplan defended the choice. President of Nintendo of America Reggie Fils-Aimé justified the new name over Revolution by saying that they wanted something short, distinctive, and easily pronounceable for all cultures.

The Wii was made available for a press demonstration at E3 2006. Planned launch titles were announced at a press conference alongside the unveiling. At the same conference, Nintendo confirmed its plans to release the console by the end of 2006.

=== 2006–2010: Launch ===
Nintendo announced the launch plans and prices for the Wii in September 2006. The console was first launched in the United States on November 19, 2006, for . Other regional release dates and prices included Japan on December 2 for , followed by Australasia on December 7 for , and was later launched on December 8 in the United Kingdom for and for the majority of Europe for . Nintendo planned to have around 30 Wii games available by the end of 2006, and anticipated shipping over 4 million consoles before the end of the year.

As part of its launch campaign, Nintendo promoted the Wii in North America through a series of television advertisements (directed by Academy Award winner Stephen Gaghan); its Internet ads used the slogans &quot;Wii would like to play&quot; and &quot;Experience a new way to play&quot;. The ads began in November 2006 and had a budget of over for the year. The ads targeted a wider demographic compared to ads for other consoles, inviting parents and grandparents to play on the Wii. Nintendo hoped that its console would appeal to a wider demographic than that of others in the seventh generation. In December 2006, Satoru Iwata said that Nintendo did not think of themselves as &quot;fighting Sony&quot;, but were focused on how they could expand the gaming demographic. This proved to be a success as the Wii would become a social phenomenon globally throughout 2007.

It took several years for the Wii to launch in other regions. It was released in South Africa on September 30, 2007, South Korea on April 26, 2008, Taiwan on July 12, 2008, India on September 30, 2008, and Hong Kong on December 12, 2009. Nintendo had planned work with its localization partner iQue to release the Wii in China in 2008, but failed to meet the requirements to circumvent the ban on foreign-made consoles the Chinese government had put in place.

=== 2011–2014: Successor and discontinuation ===


Nintendo announced the successor to the Wii, the Wii U, at E3 2011. Nintendo had recognized that the Wii had generally been shunned by the core gaming audience as it was perceived more as a casual gaming experience. The Wii U was aimed to draw the core audience back in with more advanced features atop the basic Wii technology. The Wii U features the Wii U GamePad, a controller with an embedded touchscreen and output 1080p high-definition graphics that serves as a secondary screen alongside the television. The Wii U is fully backward-compatible with Wii games and peripherals for the Wii, including the Wii Remote, Nunchuk controller and Wii Balance Board, and select Wii U games including support for these devices. The Wii U was first released on November 18, 2012 in North America; November 30, 2012 in Europe and Australia, and December 8, 2012 in Japan.

Nintendo continued to sell the revised Wii model and the Wii Mini alongside the Wii U during the Wii U&#x27;s first release year. During 2013, Nintendo began to sunset certain Wii online functions as they pushed consumers towards the Wii U as a replacement system or towards the offline Wii Mini, though the Wii Shop Channel remained available. Nintendo discontinued production of the Wii in October 2013 after selling over 100 million units worldwide, though the company continued to produce the Wii Mini unit primarily for the North American market. The WiiConnect24 service and several channels based on that service were shuttered in June 2013. Support for online multiplayer games via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection were discontinued in May 2014, while the Wii Shop was closed in January 2019, effectively ending all online services for the console. The Wii Mini continued to be manufactured for some time after.

Despite the Wii&#x27;s discontinuation, some developers continued to produce Wii games well beyond 2013. Ubisoft released &quot;Just Dance&quot; games for the Wii up to &quot;Just Dance 2020&quot; (2019). Vblank Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;&quot; along with &quot;Retro City Rampage DX&quot; are the most recent Wii games, which were released on July 9, 2020 (more than 13 years after the Wii&#x27;s launch). On January 27, 2020, Nintendo announced that it will no longer repair any faulty Wii consoles in Japan starting on February 6 due to a scarcity of spare parts.

== Hardware ==
=== Console ===
In building the Wii, Nintendo did not aim to outpace the performance of their competitors. Unlike the company&#x27;s previous consoles, they built the Wii from commercial off-the-shelf hardware rather than seek out customized components. This helped to reduce the cost of the Wii system to consumers. Miyamoto said &quot;Originally, I wanted a machine that would cost $100. My idea was to spend nothing on the console technology so all the money could be spent on improving the interface and software.&quot;
The console&#x27;s central processing unit is a 32-bit IBM PowerPC-based processor named Broadway, with a clock frequency of 729 MHz. The reduced size of Broadway—based on a 90 nm process compared to the 180 nm process used in the GameCube&#x27;s CPU—resulted in 20% lowered power consumption. The Wii&#x27;s GPU is a system on a chip produced by ATI and named Hollywood; the core processor runs at 243 MHz, 3 MB of texture memory, digital signal processors, and input/output functions. Additionally, the GPU included an additional 24 MB of 1T-SRAM and an additional 64 MB of 1T-SRAM on the motherboard, totaling to 88 MB of memory for the console. The Wii&#x27;s computational power was roughly 1.5 to 2 times as powerful as the GameCube, but was the least powerful of the major home consoles of its generation.

The Wii&#x27;s motherboard has a WiFi adapter which supports IEEE 802.11 b/g modes, and a Bluetooth antenna that communicates with its controllers. A USB-based LAN adapter can connect the Wii to a wired Ethernet network.

The Wii reads games from an optical media drive located in the front of the device. The drive is capable of reading Nintendo&#x27;s proprietary discs, the 12 cm Wii discs and 8 cm GameCube discs, but cannot read other common optical media—namely, DVD-Video, DVD-Audio or compact discs. Although Nintendo had planned on incorporating this feature into later revisions of the Wii, the demand for the console meant a delay in their schedule, until the feature lost interest. The slot of the optical drive is backed by LED lights which show the system&#x27;s status. For example, it will pulse blue when the system is communicating with the WiiConnect24 service or when reading a disc after being inserted.

The Wii includes 512 MB of internal flash memory for storing saved games and downloaded content from the Wii channels. Users could expand their storage for downloaded games and saved games, as well as provide photos and music that could be used with some games and Wii channels, through SD cards (and later SDHC cards) inserted into an external slot on the console located under a front panel. A later system update added the ability to launch Wii channels and play Virtual Console and WiiWare games directly from SD cards.

The rear of the console features the unit&#x27;s video output and power connections along with two USB ports. The top of the console, when placed vertically, includes a panel that includes four ports for GameCube controllers and two GameCube memory cards.

The Wii was Nintendo&#x27;s smallest home console at the time (the current smallest is hybrid home-portable console Nintendo Switch, when in portable mode); it measures 44 mm (1.73 in) wide, 157 mm (6.18 in) tall and 215.4 mm (8.48 in) deep in its vertical orientation, slightly larger than three DVD cases stacked together. The included stand measures 55.4 mm (2.18 in) wide, 44 mm (1.73 in) tall and 225.6 mm (8.88 in) deep. The system weighs 1.2 kg (2.7 lb), making it the lightest of the three major seventh-generation consoles. The Wii may stand horizontally or vertically.

=== Wii Remote ===

The Wii Remote is the primary controller for the console. The remote contains a MEMS-based three-dimension accelerometer, along with infrared detection sensors located at the far end of the controller. The accelerometers allow the Wii Remote to recognize its orientation after being moved from a resting position, translating that motion into gesture recognition for a game. For example, the pack-in game &quot;Wii Sports&quot; includes a ten-pin bowling game that had the player hold the Wii Remote and perform a delivery of a ball; the Wii Remote could account for the player&#x27;s position relative to the Sensor Bar, and their arm and wrist rotation to apply speed and spin to the virtual ball&#x27;s delivery on screen. The infrared detectors are used to track emissions from LEDs in the included Sensor Bar, which is placed just above or below the television display, as to track the relative orientation of the Wii Remote towards the screen. This gives the Wii Remote the ability to act as a pointing device like a computer mouse on the television screen, with an approximate range of for accurate detection. In addition, the Wii Remote features traditional controller inputs, including a directional pad (D-pad), three face action buttons, a shoulder trigger, and four system-related buttons including a power switch. The Wii Remote connects to the Wii via Bluetooth with an approximate range, communicating the sensor and control information to the console unit. The Wii Remote includes an internal speaker and a rumble pack that can be triggered by a game to provide feedback directly to the player&#x27;s hand. Up to four Wii Remotes could connect wirelessly to a Wii, with LED lights on each remote indicating which controller number the Remote had connected as. The remote is battery-operated, and when the Remote is not powered on, these LED lights can display the remaining battery power.

A wrist-mounted strap is included with the Wii Remote, with one end affixed to the bottom of the unit. Nintendo strongly encouraged players to use the strap in case the Wii Remote accidentally slipped out of their hands. Nintendo recalled the original straps in December 2006 and provided a free, stronger strap as a replacement, as well as packaging the new strap in future bundles after the company faced legal challenges from users that reported damage to their homes from the Wii Remote slipping from their hands while playing. In October 2007, Nintendo also added a silicone Wii Remote Jacket to shipments of the Wii and Wii Remote, as well as a free offering for existing users. The Jacket wraps around the bulk of the remote but leaves access to the various buttons and connectors, providing a stickier surface in the user&#x27;s grip to further reduce the chance of the Remote falling out of the player&#x27;s hand.

Accessories can be connected to a Wii Remote through a proprietary port at the base of the controller. The Wii shipped with the bundled Nunchuk—a handheld unit with an accelerometer, analog stick, and two trigger buttons—which connected to this port on the Wii Remote via a cable in length. Players hold both the Wii Remote and Nunchuk in separate hands to control supported games.

The Wii MotionPlus accessory plugs into the port at the base of the Wii Remote and augments the existing sensors with gyroscopes to allow for finer motion detection. The MotionPlus accessory was released in June 2009 with a number of new games directly supporting this new functionality, including &quot;Wii Sports Resort&quot; which included the accessory as part of a bundle. The MotionPlus functionality was later incorporated into a revision of the controller called the Wii Remote Plus, first released in October 2010.

A number of third-party controller manufacturers developed their own lower-cost versions of the Wii Remote, though these generally were less accurate or lacked the sensitivity that Nintendo&#x27;s unit had.

=== Other controllers and accessories ===
The Classic Controller is an extension for the Wii Remote, released alongside the Wii in November 2006. Its form factor is similar to classic gamepads such as that for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, with a d-pad, four face buttons, Start and Select buttons alongside the Wii connection button, and two shoulder buttons. Additionally, Nintendo included inputs present in modern controllers, like 2 analog sticks and pressure sensitive shoulder buttons. Players can use it with older games from the Virtual Console in addition to games designed for the Wii. In 2009, Nintendo released the Wii Classic Controller Pro, which was modelled after the GameCube and PlayStation 2 controllers form factor and amongst other additions, adds grips on the bottom of the controller and rearranges the placement of the shoulder buttons. However, unlike the GameCube and original Classic Controller, the Classic Controller Pro does not have pressure sensitive shoulder buttons.

The Wii Balance Board was released alongside &quot;Wii Fit&quot; in December 2007. It is a wireless balance board accessory for the Wii, with multiple pressure sensors used to measure the user&#x27;s center of balance. &quot;Wii Fit&quot; offers a number of different exercise modes which monitored the player&#x27;s position on the board, as well as exercise gamification, as to encourage players to exercise daily. In addition to use in Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Wii Fit Plus&quot; that expanded the range of exercises using the Wii Balance Board, the accessory can be used in other third-party games that translated the player&#x27;s balance on the unit into in-game controls such as &quot;Shaun White Snowboarding&quot; and &quot;Skate It&quot;. Namco Bandai produced a mat controller (a simpler, less-sophisticated competitor to the Balance Board).

One of Iwata&#x27;s initiatives at Nintendo was focused on &quot;quality of life&quot; products, those that encouraged players to do other activities beyond simply sitting and playing video games as to promote physical wellbeing. The use of motion controls in the Wii served part of this, but Nintendo developed additional accessories to give awareness of one&#x27;s health as a lead-in for the company to break into the healthcare field. At E3 2009, Nintendo had presented a &quot;Vitality Sensor&quot; accessory that would be used to measure a player&#x27;s pulse as a lead-in to a larger quality of life initiative, but this product was never released. In a 2013 Q&amp;A, Satoru Iwata revealed that the Vitality Sensor had been shelved, as internal testing found that the device did not work with all users, and its use cases were too narrow. Despite this, Nintendo has continued Iwata&#x27;s quality of life program with further products on later consoles and games.

A number of first- and third-party accessories were developed that the Wii Remote could be slotted into and then used in a more physical manner that took advantage of the accelerometer and gyroscopic functions of the controller. Some copies of &quot;Mario Kart Wii&quot; shipped with the Wii Wheel, a plastic steering wheel frame with the Wii Remote could be inserted into, so that players could steer more effectively in game. Rhythm games that used plastic instruments, such as &quot;Guitar Hero III&quot;, shipped with instruments that the Wii Remote could be slotted into; the remote powered the various buttons on the controller and relayed that to the Wii.

=== Variants and bundles ===
The Wii launch bundle included the console; a stand to allow the console to be placed vertically; a plastic stabilizer for the main stand, one Wii Remote, a Nunchuk attachment for the Remote, a Sensor Bar and a removable stand for the bar to mount on a television set, an external power adapter, and two AA batteries for the Wii Remote. The bundle included a composite A/V cable with RCA connectors, and in appropriate regions such as in Europe, a SCART adapter was also included. A copy of the game &quot;Wii Sports&quot; was included in most regional bundles.

Although Nintendo showed the console and the Wii Remote in white, black, silver, lime-green and red before it was released, it was only available in white for its first two-and-a-half years of sales. Black consoles were available in Japan in August 2009, in Europe in November 2009 and in North America in May 2010. A red Wii system bundle was available in Japan on November 11, 2010, commemorating the 25th anniversary of &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; The European version of the limited-edition red Wii bundle was released on October 29, 2010, which includes the original &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; game pre-installed onto the console, &quot;New Super Mario Bros. Wii&quot; and &quot;Wii Sports&quot;. The red Wii bundle was released in North America on November 7, 2010, with &quot;New Super Mario Bros. Wii&quot; and &quot;Wii Sports&quot;. All of the red Wii system bundles feature the Wii Remote Plus, with integrated Wii MotionPlus technology.

The prefix for the numbering scheme of the Wii system and its parts and accessories is &quot;RVL-&quot; for its codename, &quot;Revolution&quot;. The base Wii console had a model number of RVL-001, for example.

==== Cost-reduced model ====
A cost-reduced variant of the Wii (model RVL-101) was released late into the platform&#x27;s lifespan that removed the GameCube controller ports and memory card slots found on the original model. This means that this model is incompatible with GameCube games alongside the GameCube Controller for Wii games that support it. This model is often referred to as the &quot;Wii Family Edition&quot;, the name given to the bundle when it was first sold in Europe, however the term can, and is typically used to refer to any RVL-101 Wii, not just the bundle sold in Europe. Additionally, it does not include a stand, as it is intended to be positioned horizontally. Nintendo announced the new revision in August 2011 as a replacement for the original Wii model which it was discontinuing in certain regions including Europe and the United States. The new unit in its bundles was priced at , a further reduction for the Wii&#x27;s MSRP at the time of established in September 2009.

The console was first released in North America on October 23, 2011, in a black finish, bundled with a black Wii Remote Plus and Nunchuk, along with &quot;New Super Mario Bros. Wii&quot; and a limited-edition soundtrack for &quot;Super Mario Galaxy&quot;. It was released in Europe on November 4, 2011, in a white finish, bundled with a white Wii Remote Plus and Nunchuk, along with &quot;Wii Party&quot; and &quot;Wii Sports&quot;. A special bundle featuring a blue version of the revised Wii model and Wii Remote Plus and Nunchuk with the inclusion of &quot;Mario &amp; Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games&quot; was released in Europe on November 18, 2011, in collaboration with Sega. Nintendo later revised the North American bundle by replacing the prior pack-in game and soundtrack with the original &quot;Wii Sports&quot; duology; the new bundle was released on October 28, 2012.

==== Wii Mini ====
The Wii Mini (model RVL-201) is a smaller, redesigned Wii with a top-loading disc drive. In addition to the lack of GameCube support, the Wii Mini removes Wi-Fi support and online connectivity, along with the removal of the SD card slot. It also removed support for 480p and component video output. According to Nintendo of Canada&#x27;s Matt Ryan, they stripped these features to bring down the price of the console further as to make it an option for those consumers that had not yet gotten a Wii or for those who wanted a second Wii in a different location. Ryan stated that while removing the online functionality would prevent some games from being played, most Wii games could still be played without it. The Wii Mini is styled in matte black with a red border, and includes a red Wii Remote Plus and Nunchuk. According to Ryan, the red coloring was indicative of the planned exclusive release in Canada. A composite A/V cable, wired Sensor Bar and power adapter are also included.

The Wii Mini was first released on December 7, 2012, exclusively in Canada with a MSRP of . It was later released in Europe on March 22, 2013, and in the United States on November 17, 2013. The Canadian and European releases did not include a game, while &quot;Mario Kart Wii&quot; had been included in all launch bundles in the United States. Nintendo added several best-selling and critically acclaimed Wii games to its Nintendo Selects label and marketed those alongside the Wii Mini&#x27;s release. The Wii Mini was never released in countries outside of Canada, Europe and the United States.

== Software ==
The console has many internal features made available from its hardware and firmware components. The hardware allows for extendability (via expansion ports), while the firmware (and some software) could receive periodic updates via the WiiConnect24 service.
=== Wii Menu ===

The development of the Wii Menu, the main user interface for the Wii, was led by Takashi Aoyama of Nintendo&#x27;s Integrated Research &amp; Development Division. The project, named the &quot;Console Feature Realization Project&quot;, was to figure out what the Wii interface could show running in a low-power mode on an around-the-clock schedule that would be of interest for people to look at if they were not playing games. The idea of having continually updated weather and news reports made logical sense from testing, and this led to the idea of presenting these similar to a row of televisions each set to a different television channel as if in an electronics shop, creating the &quot;channels&quot; concept. A user can navigate to any channel window to bring that to the forefront, whether to launch the game or application or to get more information that was being displayed. For example, the Forecast Channel would display a brief summary of the local area&#x27;s temperature and short-term weather forecast, while clicking on the channel brought up an interactive globe that the user could manipulate with the Wii Remote to explore real-time weather conditions across the Earth.

The Wii launched with six channels: the Disc Channel which was used to launch Wii and GameCube titles from an optical disc; the Mii Channel to create Mii avatars; the Photo Channel which could be used to view and edit photos stored on an SD card; the Wii Shop Channel to purchase new games and applications; the Forecast Channel and the News Channel. In addition to default channels that came with the Wii, new channels could be added through system updates, downloaded applications from the Wii Shop Channel, or added by games themselves. Shortly after launch, other free channels created by Nintendo were made available to users, including the Internet Channel, a modified version of the Opera web browser for the Wii which supports USB keyboard input and Adobe Flash Player.

The Wii Menu channels feature music composed by video game composer Kazumi Totaka.

=== Mii ===

The Wii introduced the use of player-customized avatars called Miis, which have been continued to be used by Nintendo in the Wii U, the Nintendo 3DS family, and, to a lesser extent, the Nintendo Switch. Each player on a Wii console was encouraged to create their own Mii via the Mii Channel to be used in games like &quot;Wii Sports&quot; and some of the system software like the Mii Channel. For example, players would select their Mii in &quot;Wii Sports&quot;, creating their in-game avatar for the game. Miis could be shared with other players through the Mii Channel.

=== Nintendo DS connectivity ===
The Wii system supports wireless connectivity with the Nintendo DS without any additional accessories. This connectivity allows the player to use the Nintendo DS microphone and touchscreen as inputs for Wii games. The first game utilizing Nintendo DS-Wii connectivity is &quot;Pokémon Battle Revolution&quot;. Players with either the &quot;Pokémon Diamond&quot; or &quot;Pearl&quot; Nintendo DS games are able to play battles using the Nintendo DS as a controller. &quot;Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Echoes of Time&quot;, released on both Nintendo DS and Wii, features connectivity in which both games can advance simultaneously. Nintendo later released the Nintendo Channel, which allows Wii owners to download game demos of popular games such as &quot;Mario Kart DS&quot;, or additional data to their Nintendo DS in a process similar to that of a DS Download Station. The console is also able to expand Nintendo DS games.

=== Online connectivity ===
The Wii console connects to the Internet through its built-in 802.11b/g Wi-Fi or through a USB-to-Ethernet adapter; either method allows players to access the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service. The service has several features for the console, including Virtual Console, WiiConnect24, the Internet Channel, the Forecast Channel, the Everybody Votes Channel, the News Channel and the Check Mii Out Channel. The Wii can also communicate (and connect) with other Wii systems through a self-generated wireless LAN, enabling local wireless multi-playing on different television sets. &quot;Battalion Wars 2&quot; first demonstrated this feature for non-split screen multi-playing between two (or more) televisions.

=== Third-party applications ===
Third-party media apps were added to the Wii&#x27;s online channels, typically offered as free downloads but requiring subscriber logins for paid services. Among some of these included the BBC iPlayer in November 2009, Netflix in November 2010, Hulu in February 2012, YouTube in December 2012, Amazon Prime Video in January 2013, and Crunchyroll in October 2015. In June 2017, YouTube ended support for its Wii channel. In January 2019, Nintendo ended support for all streaming services on the Wii.

=== Parental controls ===
The console features parental controls, which can be used to prohibit younger users from playing games with content unsuitable for their age level. When one attempts to play a Wii or Virtual Console game, it reads the content rating encoded in the game data; if this rating is greater than the system&#x27;s set age level, the game will not load without a password. Parental controls may also restrict Internet access, which blocks the Internet Channel and system-update features. Since the console is restricted to GameCube functionality when playing GameCube Game Discs, GameCube software is unaffected by Wii parental-control settings.

The Wii also includes a system that records the playtime based on any game or app on the system. While Nintendo decided against a profile system that would require each user to identify themselves, they kept the cumulative playtime tracking system, which cannot be erased or altered, to give parents the means to review their children&#x27;s use of the Wii.

== Games ==


Retail copies of games are supplied on proprietary, DVD-type Wii optical discs, which are packaged in keep cases with instructions. In Europe, the boxes have a triangle at the bottom corner of the paper sleeve-insert side. The triangle is color-coded to identify the region for which the title is intended and which manual languages are included. The console supports regional lockout: software available in a region can be only played on that region&#x27;s hardware.

Twenty-one games were announced for launch day in North and South America, with another twelve announced for release later in 2006. Among the system&#x27;s launch titles in all regions included &quot;Wii Sports&quot;, which was bundled in all Wii packages except in Japan and South Korea, &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess&quot;, Sega&#x27;s &quot;Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz&quot;, and Ubisoft&#x27;s &quot;Red Steel&quot;. &quot;Metroid Prime 3: Corruption&quot; had been slated as a Wii launch title, but was pushed into 2007 a few months before the Wii&#x27;s launch. Nintendo had also planned to release &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot; as a launch title, but its director Masahiro Sakurai stated there were difficulties in adapting the format to the Wii&#x27;s motion controls to require more time for the game&#x27;s development.

New Wii games included those from Nintendo&#x27;s flagship franchises such as &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, &quot;Super Mario&quot;, &quot;Pokémon&quot;, and &quot;Metroid&quot;. Nintendo has received third-party support from companies such as Ubisoft, Sega, Square Enix, Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, and Capcom, with more games being developed for Wii than for the PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360. Nintendo also launched the New Play Control! line, a selection of enhanced ports of first-party GameCube games that have been updated to capitalize on the Wii&#x27;s motion controls.

=== Backward compatibility ===
The original launch Wii consoles are backward-compatible with all GameCube software, memory cards, and controllers, although Korean Wii consoles do not have backward compatibility. A Wii console in the backwards compatibility mode is restricted to GameCube functionality, and a GameCube controller is required to play and a GameCube memory card. Because of the lack of the expansion port on the Wii, devices using the expansion port, such as the GameCube Broadband Adapter and Modem Adapter and the Game Boy Player do not work. The revised Wii model and the Wii Mini lack the GameCube backward compatibility features.

=== Virtual Console ===

The Virtual Console service allowed Wii owners to play games originally released for Nintendo&#x27;s older consoles, including the Nintendo Entertainment System, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, and the Nintendo 64. Later updates included games from third-party consoles and computers, including the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive and Sega Mark III/Master System, NEC TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine, SNK Neo Geo, the Commodore 64 computer, the MSX computer (only in Japan), and various arcade games through Virtual Console Arcade. Virtual Console games were distributed over broadband Internet via the Wii Shop Channel and were saved to the Wii internal flash memory or to a removable SD card. Once downloaded, Virtual Console games can be accessed from the Wii Menu as individual channels or from an SD card via the SD Card Menu.

=== WiiWare ===

WiiWare was Nintendo&#x27;s foray into digital distribution on the Wii, comparable to the existing Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network. The service allowed players to purchase games digitally through the Wii Shop, downloading the games to their console to be directly ran from it. Besides facilitating this form of distribution, WiiWare was also envisioned to help support smaller and independent game developers, offering these teams a less expensive route to produce Wii games without having to go through retail production and distribution channels. The WiiWare channel launched on March 25, 2008, and remained active including through the Wii U&#x27;s lifetime until the Wii Shop Channel was discontinued in 2019.

== Reception ==
=== Critical reviews ===
The system was well received after its exhibition at E3 2006, winning the Game Critics Awards for Best of Show and Best Hardware. Later in December, &quot;Popular Science&quot; named the console a Grand Award Winner in home entertainment. The game proceeded to win multiple awards; the console was awarded Spike TV&#x27;s Video Games Award, a Golden Joystick from the Golden Joystick Awards, and an Emmy Award for game controller innovation from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. IGN and &quot;The Guardian&quot; named the Wii the 10th greatest video game console of all time out of 25, and &quot;GameSpot&quot; chose the console as having the best hardware in its &quot;Best and Worst 2006&quot; awards.

The Wii was praised for its simple yet responsive controls, as well as its simplicity that appeals to broader audiences. Although Dan Grabham of Tech Radar enjoyed its simple mechanics, stating how &quot;even grandparents can pick things up pretty quickly&quot;, he also enjoyed the depth of content carried over from the GameCube. CNET likened the &quot;no-brainer&quot; setup and the easy to navigate home screen. Will Wright, the creator of &quot;The Sims&quot;, called the Wii &quot;the only next gen system I&#x27;ve seen&quot;, and rather considered the PS3 and the Xbox 360 as simply successors with &quot;incremental improvement&quot;. He believed that the Wii did not only improve on graphics, but also complimented how it &quot;hits a completely different demographic&quot;. Reviewers were fond of the compact design, with Ars Technica comparing it to an Apple product.

By 2008, two years after the Wii&#x27;s release, Nintendo acknowledged several limitations and challenges with the system (such as the perception that the system catered primarily to a &quot;casual&quot; audience and was unpopular among hardcore gamers). Miyamoto admitted that the lack of support for high-definition video output on the Wii and its limited network infrastructure also contributed to the system being regarded separately from its competitors&#x27; systems, the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Miyamoto originally defended Nintendo&#x27;s decision to not include HD graphics in the Wii, stating that the number of HDTV&#x27;s in people&#x27;s homes at the time was &quot;really not that high, yet. Of course I think five years down the road it would be pretty much a given that Nintendo would create an HD system, but right now the predominant television set in the world is a non-HD set.&quot; In 2013, Miyamoto said in an interview with Japanese video game website 4Gamer that &quot;Even for the Wii, no matter how much it made the system cost, it would have been great if it were HD in the first place.&quot;

At the same time, criticism of the Wii Remote and Wii hardware specifications had surfaced. Former GameSpot editor and Giantbomb.com founder Jeff Gerstmann stated that the controller&#x27;s speaker produces low-quality sound, while Factor 5 co-founder Julian Eggebrecht stated that the console has inferior audio capabilities and graphics. UK-based developer Free Radical Design stated that the Wii hardware lacks the power necessary to run the software it scheduled for release on other seventh-generation consoles. Online connectivity of the Wii was also criticized; Matt Casamassina of &quot;IGN&quot; compared it to the &quot;entirely unintuitive&quot; service provided for the Nintendo DS.

Although the Wii Mini was met with praise for being cheap, considering it was bundled with a Wii Remote, Nunchuk and a copy of &quot;Mario Kart Wii&quot;, it was considered inferior compared to the original console. Critics were disappointed in the lack of online play and backward compatibility with GameCube games, and also believed the hardware was still rather quite large, being about half the size of the Wii; &quot;Eurogamer&quot;″s Richard Leadbetter thought the Wii Mini was not any more &quot;living room friendly&quot;, as he believed the &quot;bright red plastics make it stand out much more than the more neutral blacks and whites of existing model&#x27;s casing.&quot; He stated that the overall design was rough in texture, and seemed to have been built with emphasis on durability. &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; reviewer Damien McFerran said that the lightweight design of the Wii Mini makes it feel &quot;a little cheaper and less dependable&quot; with empty space inside the shell. CNET criticized the pop-open lid for inserting disks to be &quot;cheap-feeling&quot;.

=== Third-party development ===
The Wii&#x27;s success caught third-party developers by surprise due to constraints of the hardware&#x27;s distinct limitations; this led to apologies for the quality of their early games. In an interview with Ubisoft&#x27;s Yves Guillemot and Alain Corre admitted that they made a mistake in rushing out their launch titles, promising to take future projects more seriously. An executive for Frontline Studios stated that major publishers were wary of releasing exclusive titles for the Wii, due to the perception that third-party companies were not strongly supported by consumers. 1UP.com editor Jeremy Parish stated that Nintendo was the biggest disappointment for him in 2007. Commenting on the lack of quality third-party support, he stated that the content was worse than its predecessors, resulting in &quot;bargain-bin trash&quot;.

Additionally, the lack of third-party support also came from the fact that first-party games released by Nintendo were too successful, and developers were having issues with competing. Game developers, such as Rod Cousens, CEO of Codemasters were having issues with the slow sales on the Wii. The &quot;Nikkei Business Daily&quot;, a Japanese newspaper, claimed that companies were too nervous to start or continue making games for the console, some of which considering the Wii to be a fad that will eventually die down in popularity. Nintendo considered why this was the case was due to the fact that they &quot;know the Wii&#x27;s special characteristics better than anyone&quot;, and began developing the games for the console long before its release, giving them a head start.

Due to struggling sales during 2010, developers began creating alternative options. Capcom took note of the difficulty of making money on the Wii, and shifted their content to making less games, but with higher quality. According to Sony, many third-party developers originally making games for the Wii started focusing attention more of the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

=== Sales ===




Initial consumer reaction to the Wii appears to have been positive, with commentators judging the launch to have been successful. The launch of the Wii in November 2006 was considered the largest console launch by Nintendo in the Americas, Japan, Europe and Australia. The console outsold combined sales of the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in several regions in its launch period. The Wii remained in short supply through the first year. The company had already shipped nearly 3.2 million units worldwide by the end of 2006, and worked to raise production amounts to 17.5 million through 2007, but warned consumers that there would be shortages of the Wii through that year. Wii sales surpassed Xbox 360 sales by September 2007. To meet further demand, Nintendo increased production rates of the Wii from 1.6 million to around 2.4 million units per month in 2008, planning to meet the continued demand for the console.

At the March 2009 Game Developers Conference, Iwata reported that the Wii had reached 50 million sales. Nintendo announced its first price reductions for the console in September 2009, dropping the MSRP from to . The price cut had come days after both Sony and Microsoft announced similar price cuts on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles. Nintendo stated that the price reduction was in anticipation of drawing in more consumers who still cautious about buying a video game console. The Wii became the best-selling home video game console produced by Nintendo during 2009, with sales exceeding 67 million units.

In 2010, sales of the Wii began to decline, falling by 21 percent from the previous year. The drop in sales was considered to be due to a combination of the introduction of the PlayStation Move and Kinect motion control systems on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 systems, and the waning fad of the Wii system. Wii sales also weakened into 2011 as third-party support for the console waned; major publishers were passing over the Wii which was underpowered and used non-standard development tools, and instead focused on games for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and personal computers. Publishers were also drawn away from the Wii with the promise of the more powerful Wii U in the near future. Wii sales continued to decline into 2012, falling by half from the previous year. After its release in Canada on December 7, 2012, the Wii Mini had sold 35,700 units by January 31, 2013.

The Wii surpassed 100 million units sold worldwide during the second quarter of 2013. The Wii had total lifetime sales of 101.63 million consoles worldwide as of March 31, 2016, the last reported data for the console by Nintendo. At least 48 million consoles were sold in North America, 12 million in Japan, and 40 million in all other regions. , the Wii is the fifth-best-selling home console of all time, surpassed by the original PlayStation (102.4 million units), the PlayStation 4 (117.2 million units), the Nintendo Switch (125.62 million units), and the PlayStation 2 (159 million units). , the Wii is Nintendo&#x27;s second-best-selling home console, having been outsold by the Nintendo Switch in late 2021 at 143.42 million units.

, nine Wii games had sold over ten million units globally, which included &quot;Wii Sports&quot; (82.90 million, including pack-in copies), &quot;Mario Kart Wii&quot; (37.38 million), &quot;Wii Sports Resort&quot; (33.14 million), &quot;New Super Mario Bros. Wii&quot; (30.32 million), &quot;Wii Play&quot; (28.02 million), &quot;Wii Fit&quot; (22.67 million), &quot;Wii Fit Plus&quot; (21.13 million), &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot; (13.32 million), and &quot;Super Mario Galaxy&quot; (12.80 million). A total of 921.85 million titles had been sold for the Wii by June 30, 2022. The popularity of &quot;Wii Sports&quot; was considered part of the console&#x27;s success, making it a killer app for the Wii as it drew those that typically did not play video games to the system.

=== Legal issues ===

There were a number of legal challenges stemming from the Wii and Wii Remote. Several of these were patent-related challenges from companies claiming the Wii Remote infringed on their patents. Most of these were either dismissed or settled out of court. One challenge was from iLife Technologies Inc., who sued Nintendo over their Wii Remote&#x27;s motion detection technology for patent infringement in 2013. iLife initially won a judgement against Nintendo in 2017. The case was overturned in 2020, with the appellate court ruling that iLife&#x27;s patents were too broad to cover the specific motion detection technologies developed by Nintendo.

There were lawsuits against Nintendo claiming physical damage done by ineffective wrist straps on the Wii Remote when they slipped out of players&#x27; hands and broke television screens or windows. The first class action suit filed in December 2006 led Nintendo to issue a product recall for the existing wrist straps and send out new versions that had an improved securing mechanism for the wrist. A second class action lawsuit was filed by a mother in Colorado in December 2008, claiming the updated wrist straps were still ineffective. This suit was dismissed by September 2010, finding for Nintendo that the wrist straps were not knowingly faulty under Colorado consumer protection laws.

== Legacy ==
=== Impact on Nintendo ===
The Wii has been recognized as Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;blue ocean&quot; strategy to differentiate itself from its competitors Sony and Microsoft for the next several years. The Wii has since become seen as a prime example of an effective blue ocean approach. While Sony and Microsoft continued to innovate their consoles on hardware improvements to provide more computational and graphics power, Nintendo put more effort towards developing hardware that facilitated new ways to play games. This was considered a key part to the success of the console, measured by sales over its competitors during that console generation. However, Nintendo did not maintain this same &quot;blue ocean&quot; approach when it took towards designing the Wii U, by which point both Sony and Microsoft had caught up with similar features from the Wii. These factors partially contributed towards weak sales of the Wii U.

Part of the Wii&#x27;s success was attributed to its lower cost compared to the other consoles. While Microsoft and Sony have experienced losses producing their consoles in the hopes of making a long-term profit on software sales, Nintendo reportedly had optimized production costs to obtain a significant profit margin with each Wii unit sold. Soichiro Fukuda, a games analyst at Nikko Citigroup, estimated that in 2007, Nintendo&#x27;s optimized production gave them a profit from each unit sold ranging from in Japan to in the United States and in Europe. The console&#x27;s final price at launch of made it comparatively cheaper than the Xbox 360 (which had been available in two models priced at and ) and the then-upcoming PlayStation 3 (also to be available in two models priced at and ). Further, Nintendo&#x27;s first-party games for the Wii were set at a retail price of , about less expensive than average games for Nintendo&#x27;s competitors. Iwata stated they were able to keep the game price lower since the Wii was not as focused on high-resolution graphics in comparison to the other consoles, thus keeping development costs lower, averaging about per game compared to required for developing on the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3.

=== Health effects ===
The Wii was marketed to promote a healthy lifestyle via physical activity. It has been used in physical rehabilitation, and its health effects have been studied for several conditions. The most studied uses of Wii for rehabilitation therapy are for stroke, cerebral palsy, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and for balance training. The potential for adverse effects from video game rehabilitation therapy (for example, from falls) has not been well studied as of 2016.

A study published in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; stated that Wii players use more energy than they do playing sedentary computer games, but Wii playing was not an adequate replacement for regular exercise. Some Wii players have experienced musculoskeletal injuries known as &quot;Wiiitis&quot;, &quot;Wii knee&quot;, &quot;Wii elbow&quot; (similar to tennis elbow) or &quot;nintendinitis&quot; from repetitive play; a small number of serious injuries have occurred, but injuries are infrequent and most are mild.

In May 2010, Nintendo gave the American Heart Association (AHA) a $1.5 million gift; the AHA endorsed the Wii with its Healthy Check icon, covering the console and two of its more active games, &quot;Wii Fit Plus&quot; and &quot;Wii Sports Resort&quot;.

=== Homebrew, hacking, and emulation ===
The Wii has become a popular target for homebrewing new functionality and video games since its discontinuation. For example, homebrew projects have been able to add DVD playback to unmodified Wii consoles. The Wii also can be hacked to enable an owner to use the console for activities unintended by the manufacturer. Several brands of modchips are available for the Wii.

The Wii Remote also became a popular unit to hack for other applications. As it connected through standard Bluetooth interfaces, programmers were able to reverse engineer the communications protocol and develop application programming interfaces for the Wii Remote for other operating systems, and subsequently games and applications that used the Wii Remote on alternate platforms. Further hacks at the hardware level, typically taking apart the Wii Remote and Sensor Bar and reconfiguring its components in other configurations, led to other applications such as remote hand and finger tracking, digital whiteboards, and head tracking for virtual reality headsets.

The Wii has been a popular system for emulation; while the act of creating such emulators in a cleanroom-type approach have been determined to be legal, the actions of bringing the Wii system software and games to other systems has been of questionable legality and Nintendo has actively pursued legal action against those that distribute copies of their software. The open-source Dolphin project has been able to successfully emulate the Wii and GameCube through several years of cleanroom efforts.

=== Music ===
Joe Skrebels of &quot;IGN&quot; has argued that the Wii&#x27;s greatest and longest lasting legacy is that of the music composed by Totaka for the console, writing: &quot;Motion controls, Miis, and balance boards have all been removed or diminished as Nintendo moved on, but take a quick look across YouTube, TikTok, or Twitter, and I guarantee it won&#x27;t take all that long to hear a Wii track. Covers and memes featuring music from the Wii are &quot;everywhere.&quot; Music written for the Wii has taken on a new life as a cultural touchstone, and inspired people far beyond the confines of the little white wedge it was composed for.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Michael Andor Brodeur described the Mii Channel music as &quot;a cultural touchstone&quot;, while Martin Robinson of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; called the theme of the Wii Shop Channel &quot;a song so infectious it went on to become a meme&quot;; both the Mii Channel theme and Wii Shop Channel theme have inspired jazz covers.

<text>Pope Benedict IV (; – 30 July 903) was the bishop of Rome and ruler of the Papal States from 1 February 900 to his death. The tenth-century historian Flodoard, who nicknamed him &quot;the Great&quot;, commended his noble birth and public generosity.

Benedict was a native of Rome, the son of one Mammalus, and was ordained priest by Pope Formosus. He succeeded Pope John IX. In 900, he excommunicated Count Baldwin II of Flanders for murdering Archbishop Fulk of Reims. In 901, Benedict crowned Louis the Blind as emperor. In 902, Berengar of Friuli defeated Louis III and forced him to leave Italy. Benedict died in Rome during the summer of 903; it is possible that Berengar had some involvement. Benedict was buried in front of St Peter&#x27;s Basilica, by the gate of Guido. He was followed by Pope Leo V.

<text>Etheldred Anna Maria Benett (22 July 1776 – 11 January 1845) was an early English geologist who devoted much of her life to collecting and studying fossils that she discovered in South West England. She worked closely with many principal geologists and her fossil collection, considered one of the largest at the time, played a part in the development of geology as a field of science.

==Early life==
Etheldred Anna Maria Benett was born in 1776 (or 1775) into a wealthy family as the second daughter of Thomas Benett (1729–1797) of Wiltshire and Catherine &quot;née&quot; Darell (d. 1790). Her maternal great-grandfather was William Wake, Archbishop of Canterbury. Her elder brother John was member of Parliament for Wiltshire and later South Wiltshire from 1819 to 1852; his daughter married Lord Charles Spencer-Churchill.

From 1802 she lived at Norton House in Norton Bavant, near Warminster, Wiltshire where she lived with her sister Anna Maria. Very little is known about Benett&#x27;s home life, beyond her contributions to geology, and there is no known portrait of her, although a silhouette was published in H. B. Woodard&#x27;s &quot;History of Geology&quot; (1911).

== Fossil collection ==
From at least 1809 until her death, she devoted herself to collecting and studying the fossils of her native county, beginning with the Warminister area. Benett was knowledgeable in stratigraphy, which aided her searches, and her wealth enabled her to hire collectors and purchase prepared specimens.

Her interest in geology was encouraged by her sister in-law&#x27;s half brother, the botanist Aylmer Bourke Lambert. Lambert was an avid fossil collector who contributed to James Sowerby’s &quot;Mineral Conchology&quot;; he was a founding member of the Linnean Society, a member of the Royal Society, and an early member of the Geological Society. It was through him that Benett developed her love of fossils and relationships with many leading geologists of the time, and it is only through works by these men that most references to her work were made. For example, she contributed to Gideon Mantell&#x27;s work on stratigraphy, and also worked with Sowerby. Benett was unmarried and financially independent, and so was able to dedicate much of her life to the developing field of geology through the collection and study of fossils, especially fossil sponges.
Benett&#x27;s speciality was the Middle Cretaceous Upper Greensand in Wiltshire&#x27;s Vale of Wardour. Her collection was one of the largest and most diverse of its time, resulting in many visitors to her home. The collection consisted of over 1500 specimens that are now being recognised due to the resurfacing of said collection by a publication in 1989. Some fossils in her collection were the first to be illustrated and described, whilst others were extremely rare or unusually well preserved.

Benett had contact with many authors of works on fossils including the Sowerbys. Forty-one of her specimens were included in Sowerby&#x27;s &quot;Mineral Conchology&quot;, a major fossil reference work, in which she had the second-highest number of contributions. After viewing a part of her collection, and assuming she was male, Tsar Nicholas I granted her a Doctorate of Civil Law from the University of St. Petersburg at a time when women were not admitted into higher education institutions. The Geological Society also would not admit her as a member due to her being a woman. In response to her honorary doctorate, Benett noted that &quot;scientific people, in general, have a very low opinion of the abilities of my sex.&quot;

After her death, the fossil collection was sold to physician Thomas Wilson of Newark, Delaware, who donated the collection to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia .

Most of her fossil collection is currently housed at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia after purchase by Thomas Bellerby Wilson. A few items are in British museums, in particular Leeds City Museum, and possibly in St. Petersburg. These collections contain many type specimens and some of the first fossils found with the soft tissues preserved (as recognised shortly after her death). Another particularly fascinating section of her collection was that they contained microfossils, she would have been one of the first geologists to sieve for specimens such as these, and today these are primarily used as an indication for oil deposits.

Etheldred Benett&#x27;s collection contained a number of critical discoveries, for which she coined modern names and classifications. Her collection included a parcel of fossil sponges. Etheldred was the primary to call her sponges &quot;polypothecia,&quot; and her ammonites &quot;drepanites&quot; (marine molluscs). She found uncommon fossil trigoniids (saltwater clams) with protected soft anatomy. These were the first of their kind to be found.

Benett&#x27;s entire collection was assumed lost in the early 20th century, as specific specimens could not be located. However, the Philadelphia Academy&#x27;s revived interest in early English fossil collections, and particularly Benett&#x27;s collection, led to formal recognition again. This ultimately led to the discussion of her two publications, the elaboration of her taxonomic names, and the photographic illustration of many vital pieces of her collection.

Benett also took an interest in conchology and spent time collecting and detailing shells, many of which were new records. In a letter to Mantell in 1817, she claimed her shell collecting had left her with no time to look at his fossils.

Though she had a large self-acquired collection of fossils, she was also able to commission professionally sourced, cleaned, and prepared fossils to add.

== Recognition ==
Her unusual first name, one letter away from the male name Ethelred, caused many to suppose that she was a man. This mistake occurred when the Imperial Natural History Society of Moscow awarded membership to her under the name of Master Etheldredus Benett in 1836. Another example was the grant of Doctorate of Civil Law by Tsar Nicholas I; this doctorate was given to her from the University of St Petersburg at a time when women were not allowed to be accepted into higher institutions. German geologists who cited her in their works referred to her as &quot;Miss Benett&quot;.

Bennett lived during a time where many phenomena were explained by religion, including the existence of fossils. During her lifetime, many thought fossils were the result of great catastrophes related to religion, like Noah&#x27;s flood. Furthermore, several well-known scientists were members of the clergy.

Arguably, Benett faced another disadvantage beside her gender: she lived in Wiltshire, and contributing to geology from outside London was challenging. Illness and family troubles were other obstacles that prevented her from participating in geology as fully as she might have.

She met William Smith, the &quot;father&quot; of English geology, and presented him with a Tisbury coral test. He mentioned her in his letters to others, such as when he wrote about &quot;ladies in Wiltshire&quot; who had &quot;distinguished themselves in their collections&quot;. (Torrens 2000 p60) Concurring to John Needham&#x27;s novel, &quot;Forests of the Dinosaurs – Her work was instrumental within the advancement of Wiltshire&#x27;s Jurassic Finale, and permitted for the Cretaceous to be connected with the stratigraphy of the Vale of Wardour within the county of Dorset. She too communicated with a few other of the ‘giants’ of early fossil science such as Professor William Buckland, Gideon Mantell, Edward Charlesworth, Henry de la Beche, Roderick Impey Murchison and Samuel Woodward furthermore George Lyell who gave us the theory of Uniformitarianism – that the forms of nowadays are the same as those of yesteryear i.e. that &quot;the present is the key to the past&quot;.

Her work was recognised and appreciated by notable individuals of the time. Mantell described her as &quot;A lady of great talent and indefatigable research,&quot; whilst the Sowerbys note her &quot;labours in the pursuit of geological information have been as useful as they have been incessant&quot;.

Benett was chosen as the emblem for the conference ‘The role of women in the history of Geology’ held in November 2005 at the Geological Society of London.

A memorial board commemorating her achievements as England&#x27;s &#x27;The First Lady Geologist&#x27;, is located in the churchyard of All Saints Parish Church, Norton Bavant. 

==Contribution to geology and palaeontology==

Benett&#x27;s contribution to the early history of Wiltshire geology is significant as she felt at ease with, and corresponded extensively with, fellow geologists such as George Bellas Greenough (the first president of the Geological Society), Gideon Mantell, William Buckland, and Samuel Woodward. She freely gave her ideas and items from her fossil collection to worthy causes such as museums, sending one to St. Petersburg. Through exchanging numerous fossils with Mantell, a thorough understanding of the Lower Cretaceous sedimentary rocks of Southern England was reached.

As expected from women at the time, Benett was mainly self-taught in the field of geology. Her financial independence allowed for her to commission an in-depth look at a stratigraphic section of the Upper Chicksgrove quarry near Tisbury in 1819, drawn to scale, but unfortunately there is no scale indicated on the drawing. However, this commission later goes on to be the first bed-to-bed section of the Upper Chicksgrove quarry, certain stones and fossils are still being extracted from the site today, especially those of plants and reptiles. She called this &quot;the measure of different beds of stone in Chicksgrove Quarry in the Parish of Tisbury&quot;. However, the stratigraphic section was published by naturalist James Sowerby without her knowledge. Later, she contradicted some of the Sowerby&#x27;s conclusions based on her own research.

Benett corresponded extensively with fellow geologists such as George Bellas Greenough, first president of the Geological Society, Gideon Mantell, William Buckland, and Samuel Woodward. On exchanging numerous fossils with Mantell, a thorough understanding of the Lower Cretaceous sedimentary rocks of Southern England was reached.

In 1825, her painting of the meteorite which fell on County Limerick in September 1813 was deposited in Geological Society of London archives, presented in the University of Oxford by Reverend John Griffiths of Bishopstrow. The meteorite is 19 pounds in weight, and the streaked and dotted part represents the fracture. Because of her extensive collection, she wrote and privately published a monograph in 1831, which contains many of her drawings and sketches of mollusca and sponges such as her sketches of fossil Alcyonia (1816) from the Green Sand Formation at Warminster Common and the immediate vicinity of Warminster in Wiltshire. The Society holds two copies: one was given to George Bellas Greenough, and another to her friend Gideon Mantell. This work established her as a true, pioneering biostratigrapher, following but not always agreeing with the work of William Smith.

Her monograph from 1831, &quot;Catalogue of the Organic Remains of the County of Wiltshire&quot;, was published in small runs by a small printer, and not widely distributed beyond her colleagues. It is thought that she might have underestimated the value of her work.

==Later life==
Illness during the last twenty years of Benett&#x27;s life meant she spent less time collecting specimens and instead commissioned local collectors. After spending 34 years gathering what was the most extensive collection of Wiltshire fossils, Benett died at her home, Norton House, at the age of 69, two years before fellow fossil collector Mary Anning.

<text>The Socialist Republic of Czechoslovakia (1948–1990) had significant natural resources available. Energy resources included coal and lignite, but to meet energy needs the country also engaged in energy conservation, imports of oil and natural gas from the Soviet Union, and nuclear power and hydroelectricity programs. Czechoslovakia had limited deposits of various metallic mineral ores, and the bulk of mineral supplies were again imported. Other resources within the country were agricultural land, forestry, and labor power.

== Minerals, oil and power plants ==
=== Minerals and mining ===
Czechoslovakia had significant quantities of coal and lignite. 
*Hard coal suitable for extraction was present in the Ostrava coalfields and near Kladno, Plzeň, Košice, and Trutnov. 
*Brown coal and lignite deposits were located around Chomutov and Most, in the Sokolov field near Karlovy Vary, at Teplice, at České Budějovice, and near Modrý Kameň and Handlová in Slovakia. Reserves of oil and natural gas were rather small (see Oil and gas deposits in the Czech Republic). 
*Iron ore was mined in the Slovak Ore Mountains and near Prague and Plzeň, but reserves have nearly been exhausted in the 1980s. 
*There were also deposits of copper and manganese ores in the Slovenské Rudohorie. 
*Lead and zinc ores were found at Kutná Hora and Příbram in central Bohemia, but in insignificant quantities. 
*There were small amounts of mercury, antimony, and tin in the Ore Mountains, which also contained substantial uranium deposits (see Uranium mining in Czechoslovakia). 
*Additional mineral resources include salt in Slovakia, graphite near České Budějovice, and kaolin near Plzeň and Karlovy Vary.

=== 1970-1985 ===

In the 1970s, coal production expanded. During these years, the growing need for energy was met primarily by imported oil and, from the mid-1970s, by natural gas; almost all imports of oil and gas came from the Soviet Union. Domestic crude oil sources and production were modest. Within Czechoslovakia itself, numerous small oil and gas fields had been discovered, but production was minor (about 100,000 tons of crude oil and 800 million cubic meters of natural gas in 1985). These supplied only a small fraction of the country&#x27;s needs. Geological surveys largely ruled out the possibility of future discoveries of major oil or gas deposits, although one significant new source of natural gas was discovered in 1985 near Gbely in western Slovakia.

During the 1970s, the Soviet Union found it increasingly difficult and costly to meet the fuel and raw materials needs of Czechoslovakia and other East European countries. The unexploited Soviet resources tended to be located in Siberia, where extraction and transport were difficult and costly. One solution to the problem was Comecon&#x27;s decision to adjust Soviet energy prices annually after 1974; as a result, Soviet prices approached—and eventually at times exceeded—world market prices. The adjustment improved the terms of trade of the Soviet Union at the expense of Czechoslovakia and its neighbors when world prices for many commodities, particularly crude oil, rose sharply in the middle and late 1970s. The higher prices in turn resulted in a larger return to the Soviet Union for its exports of fuels and raw materials and helped to finance expansion of Soviet production capacity. In addition, in the 1970s Comecon initiated several joint projects, such as the construction of a major natural gas pipeline from the Soviet Union to Eastern Europe and of large nuclear power plants in the Soviet Union. The participating countries, including Czechoslovakia, received payments in the form of natural gas and electricity. In the mid-1980s, Czechoslovakia also participated in construction of the Yamburg natural gas pipeline &quot;Progress&quot; in the Soviet Union.

From 1967 to 1984, Czechoslovakia benefited additionally from a special agreement with the Soviet Union—in effect a Czechoslovak credit from 1967—whereby Czechoslovakia received 5 million tons of Soviet crude oil a year at a late 1960s price, which was just a small fraction of the world market price. Thus while increased Soviet fuel and raw materials export prices imposed a severe burden on Czechoslovakia, the cost was substantially less than if the country had imported these materials from noncommunist countries. In 1980 a Czechoslovak official indicated that Czechoslovakia was paying about one-fourth the world price for its oil imports. By 1985, however, the situation had changed dramatically. In 1981 the Soviet Union had announced a 10-percent cutback in the crude oil it would deliver to Central European countries during the 1981-85 period. Subsequently—and for a variety of other reasons—world oil prices plummeted, but the Soviet price, based on the five-year formula, continued to rise.

=== Mid-1980s ===
==== Minerals ====
In the mid-1980s, Czechoslovakia&#x27;s mineral resources were meager. The country was heavily dependent on imports of raw materials for use in industry. Deposits of ferrous metals were small and low grade. Imports, especially from the Soviet Union, supplied the dominant share of iron ore for the country&#x27;s important iron and steel industry. Magnetite, a basic input for the steel industry, was more plentiful, making exports possible during the 1970s and 1980s. Deposits of nonferrous metals were limited or nonexistent. Imports supplied most of the country&#x27;s needs for these metals. The country also produced limited amounts of gold and mercury. Imports supplied most of the country&#x27;s needs for nonferrous metals. Czechoslovakia did supply most of its own requirements for nonmetallic minerals to support the manufacture of building materials, glass, and ceramics.

The bulk of the country&#x27;s mining activity involved coal, the principal domestic energy source. In 1985 production of all coal amounted to 126.6 million tons, a 2.1% drop over 1984 that signaled the accelerating exhaustion of easily worked, high-grade reserves. In 1985 Czechoslovakia depended on coal for 60% of its energy consumption in contrast with 88% in 1960.

==== Energy conservation ====
In the mid-1980s, the country&#x27;s leaders considered energy conservation essential. Czechoslovakia&#x27;s heavy reliance on fuel imports was costly, with imports supplying 95% of the country&#x27;s needs. Conservation was also essential because although Soviet supplies of natural gas were expected to increase, the more important flow of crude oil was likely to stagnate. In the short run, extraction of domestic coal would help Czechoslovakia meet its growing energy needs, but the increase would be slow and costly because deeper deposits had to be mined in order to meet quotas. The fuel problem was especially acute because Czechoslovak industry had a high input of energy per unit of national income, a rate substantially higher than that of Western Europe and some of Central and East European countries (7.5 tons of standard fuel per inhabitant per year). Industrial consumption of largely imported raw materials and energy was acknowledged to be perhaps as much as 40% higher than in comparable advanced industrial countries. The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSČ) leadership accurately believed that considerable savings were possible.

==== Nuclear plants ====
Nevertheless, energy conservation alone would not suffice. Since the 1970s, economic planners had been pursuing an ambitious nuclear energy program. In the long run, in their judgment, nuclear power was absolutely vital to the projected energy balance. In late 1978, the first major nuclear power plant (of Soviet design) began operation at Jaslovské Bohunice. In 1985 and 1986, portions of the Dukovany station began test runs, and preliminary site work was underway for two more power stations, at Mochovce in western Slovakia and Temelín in southern Bohemia. Nuclear power&#x27;s share of the total electricity supply increased to almost 20% in 1986. According to the long-range plan, with expansion of this power station plus construction of additional stations and the import of electricity from joint nuclear projects in the Soviet Union, nuclear power would provide 30% or more of total electricity by 1990. Plans called for nuclear power to account for over 53% of electricity by the year 2000. Although the 1986 Chernobyl accident in the Soviet Union did not alter the government&#x27;s commitment to nuclear power, particularly since none of the existing or planned reactors used the kind of technology employed at Chernobyl, Czechoslovak leaders acknowledged the need for a thorough review of safety measures. Subsequently a number of special conferences were held concerning nuclear power issues. Czechoslovakia was well positioned to fuel its ambitious nuclear program; in the mid-1980s, the country was an important producer of uranium. The uranium reserves were located in the Ore Mountains of Bohemia.

==== Hydroelectric plants ====
In the mid-1980s, Czechoslovakia had a substantial number of hydroelectric plants, located mainly on the Váh and Vltava rivers. Work was underway on a major hydroelectric power project on the Danube River at Gabčíkovo–Nagymaros, a controversial joint project with Hungary to which environmentalists, especially in Hungary, had objected. The completed project was expected to supply about 4% of Czechoslovak energy requirements. In 1986 the government approved plans for construction of several additional power stations on the Labe River and Váh Rivers by the end of the century. Czechoslovakia imported some electricity every year from Romania.

==Land and forest==
In the 1980s, agricultural land constituted just under 55% of the country&#x27;s total land area, and most of this land was suitable for tillage. The soil is relatively fertile in the lowlands but less productive in the mountainous regions. About one-third of the country&#x27;s territory is forested. Czech forests had serious environmental problems, primarily as a result of &quot;acid rain&quot; pollution from coal-fired power stations. In the 1980s, the authorities acknowledged the seriousness of the problem, and the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1986-1990) allocated funding to combat the pollution.

==Labor==
In 1985 Czechoslovakia&#x27;s total labor force amounted to about 7.6 million persons. Of these, 46.1% were women, giving Czechoslovakia one of the highest female labor rates in the world. Almost 88% of the population of working age (between 15 and 59 years of age for men and between 15 and 54 for women) was employed in 1985. About 37.4% of the work force was in industry, 13.7% in agriculture and forestry, 24.3% in other productive sectors, and 24.6% in the service sectors.

During the first two decades following World War II, redistribution of the work force, especially movement from agriculture to industry, had provided an influx of workers for the government&#x27;s program emphasizing heavy industry. Women also had entered the work force in record numbers. But falling birthrates in the 1960s, noticeable first in the Czech lands but subsequently occurring in Slovakia as well, gave reason for concern.

During the 1970s, the government introduced various measures to encourage workers to continue working after reaching retirement age, with modest success. In addition, the large number of women already participating in the work force precluded significant increases from this source.

By the mid-1980s, the labor supply was a serious problem for Czechoslovakia. During the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1981–85), the work force increased by less than 3%. Czechoslovakia&#x27;s service sectors were less developed than those of the more industrialized countries of Western Europe, and the 1980s employment in services continued to expand faster than employment in the productive sectors. The expansion placed additional constraints on industrial enterprises seeking to fill positions. Some Western observers suggested that the labor shortage resulted in part from the tendency of many industrial enterprises to overstaff their operations.

Party and government officials set wage scales and work norms. As part of reform measures effective after 1980, incentive rewards represented a larger share of total pay than had previously been the case. Work norms also increased. Officials were clearly soliciting a greater effort from workers, in terms of both quantity and quality.

In the mid-1980s, most of the labor force was organized and was represented, at least in theory, by unions. The party controlled the unions, and a major task of the unions was to motivate workers to work harder and fulfill the plan goals. The unions served as vehicles for disseminating desired views among the workers. The principal activity of the trade unions was the administration of health insurance, social welfare, and workers&#x27; recreation programs.

<text>Sir John St Aubyn, 5th Baronet (17 May 1758 – 10 August 1839), was a British Member of Parliament, High Sheriff of Cornwall and Grand Master of the Freemasons. Born in London, he succeeded to the baronetcy on 12 October 1772, at which point he inherited Clowance, the family&#x27;s estate near Crowan, Cornwall.

==Life==
John St Aubyn was born on 17 May 1758 at Golden Square, London. His parents were Sir John St Aubyn, 4th Baronet, who was a Member of Parliament, and his wife, Elizabeth Wingfield; their daughter Catherine St Aubyn, two years John&#x27;s junior, became an amateur artist. St Aubyn attended Westminster School between 1773 and 1777. He then spent three years in France, where he had a relationship with an Italian woman and had a daughter.

St Aubyn&#x27;s father died on 12 October 1772, at which point St Aubyn succeeded to the baronetcy, inheriting Clowance, the family estate near Crowan, Cornwall. He was High Sheriff of Cornwall for 1780 and was then Member of Parliament for Truro in 1784, for Penryn from 1784 to 1790, and for Helston from 1807 to 1812. St Aubyn was also a well-known fossil collector, who in addition to his own collection purchased the large collection possessed by Richard Greene, surgeon of Lichfield (died 1793). He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1797.

From the 1790s onwards, St Aubyn had a relationship with Juliana Vinicombe (1769-1856), fathering nine children with her. He finally married Juliana on 1 July 1822: their daughter Hebe (b.1829) was the only legitimate child of the marriage.

The baronetcy became extinct on his death in August 1839, aged 81. His estate passed to his illegitimate son, James; his illegitimate son Edward was created a baronet in his own right in 1866, and was the ancestor of the Barons St Levan. He is buried at Crowan, with a monument carved by William Behnes.

<text>Sissel Kyrkjebø (; born 24 June 1969), also known abroad as Sissel, is a Norwegian soprano. She is considered one of the world&#x27;s top crossover sopranos. Her musical style ranges from pop recordings and folk songs to classical vocals and operatic arias.

She rose to prominence in Norway in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and her cover version of Ole Paus&#x27; song &quot;Innerst i sjelen&quot; (Deep in My Soul) gained wide popularity in the 1990s. She is well known for singing the Olympic Hymn (Hymne Olympique) at the opening and closing ceremonies of the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway; for duets with Plácido Domingo and Charles Aznavour at the Christmas in Vienna concert of 1994, José Carreras, Andrea Bocelli, Bryn Terfel, Josh Groban, Neil Sedaka, Mario Frangoulis, Russell Watson, Brian May, Tommy Körberg, Diana Krall, Warren G, Dee Dee Bridgewater, and The Chieftains; and for her participation on the &quot;Titanic&quot; film soundtrack.

Sissel received her first US Grammy nominations on 6 December 2007 for a collaboration with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. &quot;Spirit of the Season,&quot; a collection of songs from the choir&#x27;s 2006 Christmas concert at Temple Square, was nominated for the Best Classical Crossover Album of the Year as well as Best Engineered Classical Album.

Sissel&#x27;s combined solo record sales—not including soundtracks and other albums to which she contributed—amount to 10 million albums, most of them in Norway, a country with 5 million people. Her albums have also sold well in Sweden, Denmark, and Japan. She and Odd Nordstoga are the only Norwegian artists to have an album go 11 times platinum in album sales for &quot;Strålande Jul&quot; (Glorious Christmas).

Although Sissel sings mainly in English and Norwegian, she has also sung in Spanish, Swedish, Danish, Irish, Italian, French, Russian, Icelandic, Faroese, German, Neapolitan, Māori, Japanese, and Latin.

In Norway she is mostly known as Sissel Kyrkjebø, her last name meaning &quot;church farm&quot; or &quot;church field&quot;. She started using her first name mononymously abroad later in her career. 

==Early life==
Sissel grew up in Lønborg in Bergen Municipality with two older brothers, Eirik and Bjørn. She and her parents often took hikes in the mountains surrounding Bergen. In her early years she wanted to be a nurse, but at the age of nine music became her passion.

She joined her first children&#x27;s choir under the direction of New Zealand-born conductor Felicity Laurence. She stayed with the choir for seven years and said of her experience, &quot;That was my musical education. We sang everything: classical and jazz, folk and even Māori songs. People said we sounded like an angel choir because we had this very clean pure sound, almost like an English boys&#x27; choir.&quot;

Sissel won her first local talent competition when she was ten. She was influenced by various musical genres; her parents were interested in country music and classical music and her brothers in rock music. She has also stated that Barbra Streisand, Kathleen Battle, and Kate Bush were inspirations.

Her first name &quot;Sissel&quot; is a Norwegian variant of &quot;Cecilia&quot;. This is a popular first name from Saint Cecilia, the patron saint of church music. Her last name, meaning &quot;church farm&quot; or &quot;church field&quot;, may be derived from an agricultural property owned by or located near the local church.

==Career==

===1983–1985: First television appearances, &quot;Syng med oss&quot;===
In 1980, she appeared in the sing-along program &quot;Syng med oss&quot; (Sing with us) together with a children&#x27;s choir. Her first solo appearance was in 1984, when she sang the Norwegian folk song &quot;Ung Åslaug&quot;. Sissel performed in this program many times until 1989. Her first solo television appearance without the choir was in 1983 on Norwegian television, with the song &quot;Evergreen&quot; in the children&#x27;s program &#x27;. Later in the same year, she and Rune Larsen, her later manager, guested the television program &#x27; (&quot;Do You Remember?&quot;), hosted by Odd Grythe, in which she performed &quot;Barndomshjemmet&quot; (Childhood Home) and &quot;Sukiyaki&quot;.

Her signature song has been &quot;Å, Vestland, Vestland&quot; (O, Westland, Westland) ever since she first sang it on &quot;Syng med oss&quot; in 1985.

===1986–1994: Rise to prominence in Norway, &quot;Sissel&quot;, &quot;Soria Moria,&quot; and &quot;Innerst i sjelen&quot;===

In January 1986, Sissel appeared on the Norwegian television show &quot;Kanal 1&quot;, hosted by Ivar Dyrhaug. She performed &quot;You Don&#x27;t Bring Me Flowers&quot;, by Barbra Streisand, and later, in February, she performed &quot;Comin&#x27; In and Out of Your Life&quot; on the &quot;1986 Alpine Skiing World Cup&quot; television show in Norway. In May, Sissel performed &quot;Bergensiana&quot; during the intermission of the Eurovision Song Contest 1986, which took place in Grieg Hall in her home town of Bergen. That was her big breakthrough and in the same year, her first album, &quot;Sissel&quot;, was released. It sold more than 500,000 copies, making it the best-selling album in Norway at that time.

In 1987, Sissel made her debut on Danish television on &quot;Under Uret&quot;, hosted by Hans Otto Bisgaard. She performed two songs: &quot;Vårvise&quot; (Springtime), with Danish singer/composer Sebastian, and &quot;Summertime&quot;. Later that year, in November, Sissel released her Christmas album &quot;Glade Jul&quot; (Merry Christmas) with several traditional Christmas carols. It broke her previous record for best-selling album in Norway, and still holds the record. Upon its release, it sold more than 600,000 copies in a country with a population of fewer than 5 million. To date, it has sold approximately 1 million copies. In Sweden, a Swedish-language version was released, called &quot;Stilla natt&quot; (Silent Night). Norwegian newspaper &quot;Dagbladet&quot; honored her as &quot;The Name of the Year&quot; in December. Sissel also was invited that year to represent Norway in the Eurovision Song Contest 1987, but she declined, wanting a break from her music career. 

She attended a commercial upper-secondary school in Bergen, but in February of 1988 she performed at the memorial concert for singer/songwriter Trygve Henrik Hoff in Tromsø. He had written several of the songs on her debut album, &quot;Sissel,&quot; from 1986 but died in 1987. In the fall of 1988, Sissel moved to Oslo for a short period to play the role of Maria von Trapp in the Norwegian version of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. This production set box-office records and was seen by over 110,000 people.

In 1989, she released her third album, &quot;Soria Moria&quot;, named after a Norwegian fairy tale, which sold 180,000 copies. In the summer of the same year, Sissel travelled to the US and performed in New York City on the television program &quot;Artists for Our Common Future&quot;, which was broadcast around the world, singing &quot;Summertime&quot; and &quot;Somewhere&quot;.
On a Swedish television concert recorded in Gothenburg, she met Danish comedian and singer Eddie Skoller, whom she later married, at which they sang &quot;Vårvise&quot; (Springtime) by Sebastian.

In 1990, Sissel recorded the singing parts of the character Princess Ariel for the Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish versions of the 1989 Disney movie &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, and played the voice role of Ariel in the Norwegian and Swedish versions. In the same year Sissel visited the Faeroe Islands, developing a project called &quot;Kystland&quot; (Coastland). It resulted in two television programs, &quot;Med Sissel til Kirkjubø&quot; (With Sissel to Kirkjubø) and the church concert Tidin rennur (Time is Running Out).

In December 1990, Sissel opened the new concert hall in Oslo, Oslo Spektrum, at the Christmas concert Å gi er å se (To Give Is to See) .

In 1991, Sissel toured Norway and Denmark with her very successful church concert Tidin rennur (Time is Running Out). In the fall of 1991, Sissel met and performed with Neil Sedaka on the Norwegian television show &quot;Momarkedet&quot;, singing Sedaka&#x27;s song &quot;Solitaire&quot; while he played the piano. He was very impressed, and they collaborated on her next album, &quot;Gift of Love,&quot; which would come out the next year as her first album featuring only songs with English lyrics. On it Sissel sang three songs written by Sedaka, including a duet with him on &quot;Breaking Up Is Hard To Do&quot;.

In the winter of 1992, Sissel made a short appearance at the closing ceremony of the Olympics in Albertville, France. Dressed as a princess and seated on a giant fake polar bear as in the Norwegian folktale &quot;Kvitebjørn kong Valemon&quot; (White Bear King Valemon), she performed &quot;Molde Canticle&quot; (Molde is the name of the location of an annual music festival in Norway) by Jan Garbarek. She was also named one of the official musicians for the upcoming 1994 Winter Olympic Games in Lillehammer, Norway. In October, Sissel&#x27;s album &quot;Gift of Love&quot; was released but sold only 60,000 copies, receiving criticism for her new style. Later that year, she joined Neil Sedaka on his fall tour in Norway and also did several event performances in the US.
In the summer of 1993, Sissel played the role of Solveig in &quot;Peer Gynt,&quot; by Henrik Ibsen, at Den Nationale Scene (The National Scene) in Bergen, a performance that was very well received by critics. Later, in August, her marriage to Eddie Skoller took place in Mariakirken (St. Mary&#x27;s Church) in Bergen. Thousands of fans waited in the rain outside the church to get a glimpse of Sissel after the wedding ceremony. The wedding received a great deal of attention from the Norwegian and Danish press.

In February 1994, Sissel performed during the opening and closing ceremonies of the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer. During the Olympics, legendary Spanish tenor Plácido Domingo visited Norway, where he came across one of her earlier albums. He contacted Sissel and the next day they recorded &quot;Fire in Your Heart&quot;, an English version of &quot;Se ilden lyse&quot;, the official theme song of the Lillehammer Olympics. These two versions of the song were released in February 1994 on Sissel&#x27;s solo album &quot;Innerst i sjelen&quot; (Deep in My Soul), a collection of Nordic folk songs. Domingo invited Sissel, along with world-renowned French singer Charles Aznavour, to take part in his annual Christmas in Vienna concert later that year. The concert was broadcast around the world and released as an album internationally.

===1995–2001: Climb to international recognition, &quot;All Good Things&quot; and &quot;In Symphony&quot;===
In 1995, Sissel was invited to perform at the 1995 Live For Peace – Royal Gala in London. In celebration of 50 years since VE Day—the end of World War II in Europe—she performed before Charles, then Prince of Wales and other Royal Family members in the London Coliseum, singing the renowned aria &quot;O Mio Babbino Caro&quot; (O My Dear Papa) from the opera &quot;Gianni Schicchi&quot; by Giacomo Puccini, and the Norwegian classic &quot;Vitae Lux&quot; (Light of Life) with the choir Gli Scapoli (The Bachelors).

In 1997, Sissel toured the US with the Irish group The Chieftains. They appeared, among other places, on the Late Show with David Letterman and in Carnegie Hall. Later that summer, Sissel was involved in recording the soundtrack to the film&quot;Titanic&quot;. The soundtrack, titled &quot;&quot;, became immensely popular, reaching No. 1 on the Billboard charts and selling more than 30 million copies worldwide. James Horner, the composer of the film&#x27;s music, knew Sissel from her album &quot;Innerst i sjelen&quot; (Deep in My Soul) and he particularly liked how she sang &quot;Eg veit i himmerik ei borg&quot; (I know in Heaven there is a castle). Horner had tried out 25 or 30 singers before deciding on Sissel. She was then scheduled to record the theme song to James Cameron&#x27;s 1997 blockbuster film &quot;Titanic&quot;, but Celine Dion&#x27;s vocals were preferred due to Horner&#x27;s decision to support Dion&#x27;s career. In an interview from December 2014, Horner said: &quot;When I had completed the &quot;Titanic&quot; [movie], I had to decide for Celine Dion or Sissel[&#x27;s] [vocals]. Sissel I am very close, while Celine I had known since she was 18, and I had already written three film songs for [her]. But that was before Celine was known and filmmakers and marketing people had not done what they should have done for Celine and [her] songs. So I felt I owed her a &quot;Titanic&quot; chance, but I could [still] have used Sissel there.&quot; Instead, Sissel completed much of the film score for the soundtrack album.

Sissel had a No.1 hit across Europe in 1998 with &quot;Prince Igor&quot;, a duet with an American rapper Warren G on the concept album &quot;The Rapsody Overture&quot;, which combined American rappers with European opera singers. She sang an aria from Alexander Borodin&#x27;s opera &quot;Prince Igor&quot; during the chorus, while Warren G rapped. When the song was recorded, she had just a half hour to learn the Russian lyrics. She got help from a Russian taxi driver in New York City—whose name, coincidentally, was Igor. Although she had been on her way to the airport, the taxi driver drove her directly to the studio and followed her in. He helped her sing the Russian words correctly while she recorded her part of the lyrics. In the end, he was satisfied and they made it to the airport afterwards. 

On St. Patrick&#x27;s Day that year, Sissel made her second performance on the &quot;Late Show&quot;, singing &quot;Love, Will You Marry Me?&quot; with The Chieftains.

In 1999, Sissel started working on a new album with producer Rick Chertoff, and travelled between Copenhagen and New York. Although the CD was to be released in 2000, she was unhappy with the results of the recording sessions and scrapped the album. That year she sang the Irish Gaelic song &quot;Siúil A Rún&quot; on The Chieftains&#x27; 1999 album &quot;Tears of Stone&quot;.

At the beginning of 2000, Bergen was designated as the &quot;European city of culture&quot; and Sissel performed at the opening ceremony. In May, as a part of Bergen&#x27;s Nattjazz Festival&quot;,&quot; she performed at a concert at which she sang several duets with jazz singer Diana Krall. In November 2000, Sissel released (in Norway only) her album, &quot;All Good Things&quot;, which was her first solo album in nearly seven years. Following high sales of 300,000 copies, the album was released throughout Europe and Asia the following year, including a duet with fellow Norwegian singer Espen Lind on &quot;Where the Lost Ones Go&quot; that was also released on his album &quot;This Is Pop Music&quot; the next year. In early December, Sissel performed Christmas carols and a few of her new tunes at the Festival of Lights (Lysfest) in Bergen, culminating the city&#x27;s celebration of being the European city of culture and broadcast live online. Later the same month, she was invited to represent Norway at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert, where—after being introduced by Jane Seymour as &quot;the Norwegian star Sissel&quot;—she sang &quot;One Day&quot; and &quot;Weightless&quot;, both songs from her album &quot;All Good Things&quot;. 

Sissel also released a greatest-hits collection in Japan that included two new songs in collaboration with Gheorghe Zamfir, a Romanian pan-flutist. These songs were used on the Japanese television show &quot;Summer Snow&quot;, one of which was the show&#x27;s theme song. Enormously popular in Japan, Sissel has released several Japanese versions of her albums there.

In 2001, Sissel was asked to sing a duet with the Danish goth rockers Sort Sol (Black Sun). Inspired by the Kylie Minogue/Nick Cave ballad &quot;Where the Wild Roses Grow&quot;, she sang with Sort Sol on the track &quot;Elia Rising&quot; from their album &quot;Snakecharmer&quot;, released in May 2001. She and this group also performed together at Tivoli in Copenhagen and the Roskilde Festival that year—at the latter, before a raucous audience of 50,000 rock fans at 2 am. 

Sissel made her debut on the big screen in June, playing a female lumberjack, Inga, in the Danish children&#x27;s film &quot;Flyvende farmor&quot; (Flying Grandma). In this movie, Sissel sang the Danish song &quot;Himlen over Himmelbjerget&quot; (The Sky above Himmelbjerget). In September, Sissel played two In Symphony concerts in Drammen, Norway, with the Norwegian Radio Orchestra and special guests. The concert was broadcast in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark and was also released as a live CD, &quot;Sissel in Symphony&quot;, which sold 240,000 copies. 

Later in autumn 2001, Sissel toured Scandinavia and sang at a memorial ceremony in October at Copenhagen Airport. Sissel then performed at a memorial concert for a 17-year-old boy, Benjamin Hermansen, the victim of a racially motivated murder in a suburb of Oslo. She also performed at an AIDS/HIV benefit concert in Kulturkirken Jakob (Jacob Culture Church), Oslo, where she sang &quot;Eg ser&quot; (I See). On 6 December, Sissel performed with the Oslo Gospel Choir in Washington, DC, as part of Norwegian Visions 2001.

===2002–2008: More international success, &quot;My Heart&quot;, &quot;Nordisk Vinternatt&quot; and &quot;Into Paradise&quot;===

In 2002, Sissel recorded two duets, &quot;Ave Maria&quot; (Hail Mary) and &quot;Bist du Bei Mir&quot; (Are You with Me) (BWV 508), with Plácido Domingo in April for his &quot;Sacred Songs&quot; album, released in September of that year. On 24 May 2002, dressed in traditional Norwegian costume, Sissel performed the Norwegian psalm &quot;Lær meg å kjenne&quot; (Get to Know Me) at the wedding of Princess Märtha Louise of Norway and Ari Behn in the Nidaros Cathedral. In August, Sissel performed with the Danish Radio Orchestra at two outdoor concerts in the park surrounding Ledreborg Castle near Roskilde in Denmark. In addition to the orchestra, Sissel entertained the sold-out crowd of 22,000, along with guest artists such as Paddy Moloney and The Pilatze Brothers. 

On 1 October 2002, Sissel released her first album in the US, which sold over 100,000 copies in its first three months of release with hardly any advertising or marketing—better than Decca record executives had expected, their initial goal having been 100,000 copies in the first &quot;nine&quot; months. The album, titled &quot;Sissel&quot;, was largely a re-recording of songs from her Norwegian album, &quot;All Good Things&quot; with the addition of two songs, &quot;Solitaire&quot; and &quot;Shenandoah&quot;. In late 2002, one of Sissel&#x27;s concerts was filmed at the Oslo Spektrum and later broadcast on PBS in the US in March 2003. Among her guests was British singer Russell Watson. The production was subsequently released as the DVD &quot;Sissel in Concert&quot;. In December 2002, she was once again invited to represent Norway at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert, at which she sang &quot;Somewhere Over the Rainbow&quot; from &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; and &quot;The Prayer&quot; in a duet with Josh Groban. 

Sissel closed out 2002 by performing at a Christmas concert, Christmas in Moscow 2003, in Moscow, Russia with José Carreras, Plácido Domingo, and Emma Shapplin. The concert garnered mixed reviews from the Russian media, although Sissel received all-around high marks. Originally broadcast on Russian television, it was released on CD in October 2014.

In April 2003, Sissel performed in Tokyo, Japan. During April and May, she also toured the US, visiting Philadelphia, St. Louis, and New York City. A Poulsen rose—a rose bred to thrive in cold Scandinavian winters—was named after Sissel on 10 August in Denmark with the accolade, &quot;She spreads joy among all of us with her wonderful voice&quot;. During the award ceremony in the garden of Haraldsted Church, Sissel performed &quot;The Rose&quot;, &quot;Vatnet, våren, fela&quot;, and &quot;Solveig&#x27;s Song&quot;. Later that year, she sang with Swedish singer Peter Jöback on the Christmas single &quot;Gå inte forbi&quot; (Don&#x27;t Pass By) for his new holiday CD and also guested him on his Christmas tour in Sweden.

Sissel released her second US album, &quot;My Heart&quot;, in March 2004. It was a classical crossover album, including two pop songs written by Richard Marx and one ballad, &quot;Wait A While&quot;, written by Jon Lord of Deep Purple. &quot;My Heart&quot; reached No. 3 on the Billboard Classical Album Chart after debuting at No. 7 and spent 31 weeks there. In the summer and fall of 2004, Sissel went on tour with The Lord of the Rings Symphony. She was a featured soloist for an orchestral performance dedicated to the music from &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; films. &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; composer Howard Shore, who arranged and conducted the music, planned on hiring three soprano singers to handle the vocal chores, but after hearing Sissel, decided she would be enough. At each performance, Sissel performed with a symphony orchestra and choirs with 200 musicians on stage. Shore commented: &quot;Ancient Norwegian mythology and culture had a great influence on Tolkien&#x27;s work. It is very thrilling to have the Norwegian singer Sissel perform as a soloist in The Lord of the Rings Symphony. Sissel&#x27;s radiant voice illuminates this work.&quot; When asked about the tour in an interview, Sissel replied: &quot;I love the music. It&#x27;s such a wonderful feeling to be sitting in the middle of a symphony orchestra, surrounded by the beautiful voices of the choir and all those gorgeous melodies.&quot;

In May 2005, Sissel performed with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir in Salt Lake City, Utah, on its radio and television broadcast, &quot;Music and the Spoken Word&quot;, featured on nearly 2,000 stations across the US and around the world. She joined the choir to commemorate the centennial of Norwegian independence from Sweden, which was being celebrated that year. She sang the ABBA song &quot;Like An Angel Passing Through My Room&quot;; &quot;Vitae Lux&quot; (Light of Life); the traditional Norwegian hymn &quot;Herre gud, ditt dyre navn og ære&quot; (Lord God, Your Precious Name and Glory); and the Norwegian national anthem &quot;Ja, vi elsker dette landet&quot; (Yes, We Love This Country) with the choir. 

On 8 October 2005, King Harald of Norway made Sissel a Knight of the 1st Class in the Order of St. Olav for her contributions to music and as an ambassador for Norway. She was 36 years old. The ceremony was held on 25 January at the Hotel Bristol in Oslo. In the same month, Sissel was invited to perform in the well-known temple-concert, Ninna-ji Otobutai, in Osaka, Japan, where she sang &quot;Pie Jesu&quot; (Merciful Jesus); &quot;Sancta Maria&quot; (Holy Mary, an intermezzo from Pietro Mascagni&#x27;s opera &quot;Cavalleria Rusticana&quot;); &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot;; and several other songs. This concert was aired on television in Japan.

In December 2006, Sissel again joined the Mormon Tabernacle Choir as the featured soloist for its annual Christmas concerts. In four performances, she sang for more than 80,000 people in the 21,000-seat Conference Center in Salt Lake City. The concerts were videotaped for PBS television and aired the year after, in December 2007. She also celebrated more than 20 years in the music industry with the release of a greatest-hits album presenting 40 of her best and most well-known songs, including some never before released. In December she toured Norway with her Christmas concerts, including a mix of Christmas carols and hits from her greatest-hits release that year.

In March 2007, a statistically representative sample of the Norwegian population chose Sissel as the best female Norwegian musical artist in competition with 15 other famous names, including Lene Marlin, Wenche Myhre, Kari Bremnes, and Bertine Zetlitz. In the summer of 2007, she toured Norway, Sweden, and the US with a band but without a choir. According to Sissel, this was a new concert format for her. For the 2007 holiday season, PBS stations aired two concerts starring her as part of the December pledge drive, one with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir titled Spirit of the Season, released on CD and DVD in late September 2007; the other with operatic legend and good friend José Carreras titled &quot;Northern Lights&quot;, released on CD and DVD in early November 2007. These concert albums have proven to be extremely popular, with &quot;Northern Lights&quot; reaching No. 10 on the Billboard Classical Crossover list and &quot;Spirit of the Season&quot; staying firmly planted at No.1 on the Billboard Classical charts for nine consecutive weeks.
The album &quot;Northern Lights&quot; is a live recording of a concert at Bergstadens Ziir (&quot;Jewel of the Mountain Town&quot; in German), a church from the 17th century in Røros, Norway, a 17th-century mining town. This recording was inspired by Norway&#x27;s winter, the Blue hour, and the mystical Northern Lights, with music arranged by Kjetil Bjerkestrand.Sharing the stage with Sissel were the Trondheim Soloists, the Nidaros Cathedral Girls Choir, and Sissel&#x27;s own band and featuring the tenor José Carreras, performing the Julio Iglesias/Dolly Parton-duet &quot;When You Tell Me That You Love Me&quot; with Sissel. She conducted an eight-city US tour in February 2008, singing selections from &quot;Northern Lights&quot;. A second leg of the tour covered more cities in the central and southern US and lasted through April.

===2009–present: New influences and break from music, &quot;Strålande Jul&quot; and &quot;Til deg&quot;===
On 9 November 2009, Sissel released a new Christmas album called &quot;Strålande Jul&quot; (Glorious Christmas), a project with Odd Nordstoga, another popular Norwegian singer. This album presented mostly lesser-known Christmas carols from Scandinavia. Sissel toured in both Norway and Sweden with Nordstoga; The Real Group; Orsa Spelmän; and Krister Henrikson. This album and their sold-out Christmas concerts received much critical acclaim in Norway and Sweden. The record company Universal Music anticipated sales of about 100,000 CDs but ultimately sold more than 400,000 in Norway in the first two months.

In May 2010, Sissel visited China with the Trondheim Soloists, appearing at Expo 2010 in Shanghai. They performed songs like &quot;Jag vill alltid følja dig&quot; (I Always Want to Follow You), &quot;Solveig&#x27;s Song&quot;, and &quot;Wait A While&quot;. Parts of these concerts were broadcast on Norwegian television in the summer of 2010. 

On 20 September 2010, an unauthorized biography of Sissel titled &quot;Sissel&quot; by Stig Nilsson was released in Norway. He had written several songs for Sissel earlier in her career. In the book, Nilsson claims—among other things—that Sissel never became a worldwide superstar because she did not want to be. The book has been released only in Norwegian. On 15 November 2010, Sissel released a new album in Scandinavia called &quot;Til deg&quot; (For You), recorded in ABBA&#x27;s Polar Studios in Stockholm; Nidaros Studios in Trondheim; and Nashville. This album showed a new direction in music heavily influenced by the style of country music, roots, and folk. The album featured five songs in Swedish, three in Norwegian, and two in English, including a Norwegian translation of Victoria Shaw&#x27;s song &quot;Never Alone&quot; titled &quot;Velkommen hjem&quot;, and a Swedish cover of Alison Krauss&#x27; song &quot;Ghost in This House&quot; titled &quot;Levande död&quot;. Collaborating with Sissel on the new album were Mikael Wiehe, Espen Lind, and Py Bäckman.
In 2011 Sissel moved back to Norway after 22 years in Denmark. On 21 August 2011, Sissel performed the Norwegian hymn &quot;Til ungdommen&quot; (To the Youth), by Nordahl Grieg at the National Memorial Ceremony for the victims of the 22 July 2011 terrorist attacks. This ceremony took place in Oslo Spektrum and was broadcast live in all the Nordic countries. HM King Harald and HM Queen Sonja of Norway attended this ceremony with members from all the Nordic Royal Houses; the prime ministers of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark; and the presidents of Iceland and Finland. In September, Sissel got her own stamp in Norway when a set of stamps of four Norwegian female performers was issued.

In December 2012, Sissel performed exclusively in two free Christmas concerts in St John&#x27;s Church, Bergen. This was the first time she performed a Christmas concert on her own in that church.

In November 2013, Sissel officially returned to the stage after a three-year break. She appeared on the Norwegian talk show &quot;Lindmo&quot;, where she performed &quot;My Tribute&quot; by Andrae Crouch. She toured Norway in November and December for her Christmas concerts, with a new mix of Christmas and gospel songs, hiring three gospel singers from New York to back her up on these concerts.

On 17 May 2014, Sissel performed the Norwegian national anthem &quot;Ja, vi elsker dette landet&quot; (Yes, We Love This Land) and Grieg&#x27;s &quot;Våren&quot; (Spring) on the Norwegian Constitution Day 2014 in Eidsvoll, Norway. Royal guests from Norway, Sweden, and Denmark attended this ceremony, which was broadcast live on television. Later, in September, Sissel performed with the Greek tenor Mario Frangoulis at a concert on 5 September at the Odeon of Herodes Atticus in Greece. This concert, Sing Me An Angel, was held to aid the non-profit organisation I Live For Me. Sissel and Frangoulis performed several duets, including &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot;; &quot;Nights in White Satin&quot;; &quot;Smile&quot;; and &quot;What A Wonderful World&quot;. Sissel toured Norway and Sweden with her acclaimed Christmas concerts in November and December. In the fifth episode of Season 3 of American television political drama series &quot;The Newsroom&quot;, which aired in December, a recording of Sissel singing &quot;Oh Shenandoah&quot; was played over the death scene of Charlie Skinner (Sam Waterston).

In 2015 Sissel performed as vocal soloist at two Titanic Live concerts in Lucerne, Switzerland on 13 and 14 March, and later at the Royal Albert Hall, London on 27 April, where she performed the vocal lines of James Horner&#x27;s orchestral score as well as the solo soprano for &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;. A few weeks later Horner died when his single-engine Tucano aircraft crashed in the Los Padres National Forest, California. In December 2015, Sissel was as one of nine persons nominated for the 2016 Hall of Fame at Rockheim in Norway.

The beginning of 2016 saw Sissel performing at a television broadcast Royal Gala on 17 January, celebrating the 25th anniversary, or Silver Jubilee, of HM The King and HM The Queen of Norway&#x27;s accession to the Norwegian throne. Sissel sang &quot;For alltid&quot; (Forever), written by Ole Paus. She toured Sweden in the fall from 14 to 31 October with her new concert, Songs of Love. In November and December, she toured Norway, Denmark and Iceland with her Christmas concert, Sissels Jul (Sissel&#x27;s Christmas). In December, Sissel again was nominated for the 2017 Hall of Fame at Rockheim in Norway, and the 2014 PBS concert Sing Me An Angel with Mario Frangoulis was broadcast on television in the US.

In February 2017 Sissel performed at a television broadcast celebration concert for her friend singer-songwriter Ole Paus in the Opera House in Oslo. And in November/December she toured Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Iceland with her Christmas concert success, Sissels Jul.

In May 2019 Sissel released the first of 50 new songs that came out each week for the following 50 weeks. This new project, named &quot;Reflections&quot; celebrated Sissel turning 50 years old that year. On 6 June, she performed together with Italian singer Andrea Bocelli at a concert in Oslo. In July, she was again invited to perform with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and the orchestra at Temple Square in their Pioneer Day concert, which was also broadcast on YouTube. In August, she made a special guest appearance on the popular Swedish television show &quot;Allsång på Skansen&quot;, where she performed two new songs, &quot;Welcome to My World&quot; and &quot;Surrender&quot;.

<text>Turrón (), torró ( / ) or torrone () is a Mediterranean nougat confection, typically made of honey, sugar, and egg white, with toasted almonds or other nuts, and usually shaped either into a rectangular tablet or a round cake. &quot;Turrón&quot; is usually eaten as a dessert food around Christmas in Spain and Italy.
In Malta it is sold in street stalls as &quot;qubbajd&quot; during the parish patron saint feast of the various localities.

Similar products are sold in street stalls of North African Arab states such as Tunisia, suggesting Arab or moor origins.

==Name==
This nougat confection is known by similar names in different languages. In Spanish it is (), in Catalan (), in Valencian (), in Italian (), in Portuguese (), and in Brazilian Portuguese (). In Sardinian it is called () and in Tagalog ().

==Recipe==
The 16th-century &quot;Manual de Mujeres&quot; (&quot;Women&#x27;s handbook&quot;), a handbook of recipes for cosmetics and some foodstuffs, has what is probably the oldest existing Spanish &quot;turrón&quot; recipe. It calls for honey and some egg whites, cooked until it becomes breakable once cooled. Once the honey is caramelized the recipe suggests adding pine nuts, almonds or hazelnuts, peeled and roasted. The mix is then cooked a bit further, and finally removed from the heat and cut into slices.

==History==
All versions of the name appear to have been derived from Latin &quot;torrere&quot; (&#x27;to toast&#x27;). The modern confection might be derived from the Muslim recipe prevalent in parts of Islamic Spain known as &quot;turun&quot;, or even from an ancient Greek recipe. One may also point to a similar confection named &quot;cupedia&quot; or &quot;cupeto&quot; that was marketed in Ancient Rome and noted by Roman poets.

&quot;Turrón&quot; or &quot;torró&quot; has been known at least since the 15th century in the city of Jijona/Xixona (formerly Sexona), north of Alicante. &quot;Turrón&quot; is commonly consumed in most of Spain, some countries of Latin America, and in Roussillon (France). The similar &quot;torrone&quot; is typical of Sicily, Cremona and Benevento, in Italy. Similar confections, called &quot;panucha&quot;, are produced in the Philippines.

Variations are found in several regions of the northern Mediterranean.

==Types==
&quot;Turrón&quot; itself can take on a variety of consistencies and appearances, however, they traditionally consisted of the same ingredients; the final product may be either hard and crunchy, or soft and chewy. Thirty years ago almost all &quot;turrón&quot; recipes followed the same specifications, but since the diversification of products there are currently dozens of varieties: chocolate with puffed rice or whole almonds; all kinds of chocolate pralines, with or without liquor, candied fruits or whole nuts; fruit pralines; and even sugarless variations (sweetened with fructose or artificial sweeteners).

===Spanish &quot;turrón&quot;===
Traditional Spanish &quot;turrón&quot; may be classified as:
* Hard / &quot;duro&quot; (the &quot;Alicante&quot; or &quot;Alacant&quot; variety, named after the city of Alacant): a compact block of whole almonds in a mass of eggs, honey and sugar; 60% almonds. Depending on the thickness, one may find it difficult to break pieces of &quot;turrón duro&quot; as it is so rigid.
* Soft / &quot;blando&quot; (the &quot;Jijona&quot; or &quot;Xixona&quot; variety, named after the city of Xixona): the almonds are reduced to a paste. The addition of oil makes the matrix bond better; 64% almonds. &quot;Turrón blando&quot; has a much more mushy and crumbly consistency.

This variation in ingredients and resulting dryness reflects a continuum that exists also in amaretto (almond-flavored) cookies, from a meringue to a macaroon.

Other varieties include &quot;torró d&#x27;Agramunt&quot; from near Lleida, &quot;torró de Xerta&quot; from near Tortosa and &quot;torró de Casinos&quot;.

In modern times, the name &quot;turrón&quot; has widened its meaning in Spain to include many other sweet preparations that, in common with traditional &quot;turrón&quot;, are sold in bars of around 20 x 10 x 3 cm. These bars can have chocolate, marzipan, coconut, caramel, candied fruit, etc.

===Italian &quot;torrone&quot;===

&quot;Torrone&quot; is a traditional winter and Christmas confection in Italy and many varieties exist. It differs from the Spanish version in that a lower proportion of nuts is used in the confection. Traditional versions from Cremona, Lombardy, range widely in texture (&quot;morbido&quot; () and chewy, to &quot;duro&quot; () and brittle) and in flavor (with various citrus flavorings, vanilla, etc., added to the nougat) and may contain whole hazelnuts, almonds and pistachios or only have nut meal added to the nougat. Some commercial versions are dipped in chocolate. The popular recipes have varied with time and differ from one region to the next. &quot;Torrone di Benevento&quot; from Benevento, Campania, sometimes goes by the historic name &quot;Cupedia&quot;, which signifies the crumbly version made with hazelnuts. The softer version is made with almonds. The &quot;torrone di Benevento&quot; is considered to be the oldest of its kind since it predates Roman times and was widely known in the territories of Samnium. Although originally resembling sticky paste, it now differs only marginally from the varieties of &quot;torrone di Cremona&quot;. Abruzzo, Sicily and Sardinia also have local versions that may be slightly distinct from the two main denominations from Lombardy and Campania.
* &quot;Torrone di mandorle&quot; (usually eaten around Christmas): blocks of chopped almonds in a brittle mass of honey and sugar.
* &quot;Torrone di Bagnara Calabra&quot; is a well-known &quot;torrone&quot; given the designation IGP. The recipe, which dates from at least 1700, includes orange blossom honey (from Calabria), almonds (from Sicily), egg whites, sugar, cocoa, and essential oil. There are two variations: &quot;Martiniana&quot;, dusted in confectioners sugar; &quot;Torrefatto&quot;, dusted in cocoa powder.

===Peruvian &quot;turrón&quot;===

In Peruvian cuisine &quot;turrón&quot; generally is soft and may be flavored with anise. The original Spanish recipe, which contained ingredients that were rare or expensive in Peru (such as almonds, rose water, orange blossom water, honey), was modified in a variety of ways. One common variety found in Lima is &quot;turrón de Doña Pepa&quot;, an anise and honey nougat that is traditionally prepared for the Señor de los Milagros (or Lord of Miracles) religious procession, during October.

===Philippine &quot;turrón&quot;===

Cashew &quot;turrón&quot; (Philippine Spanish: &quot;turrones de casúy&quot;; Spanish: &quot;turrones de anacardo&quot;) from Pampanga Province is a derivative. It is a bar of marzipan made with cashew nuts, and wrapped in a white wafer. Unlike in the rest of Hispanidad, this candy is not associated with the holiday season. Another derivative is the &quot;turrones de pili&quot;, made using the native pili nut.

A similar delicacy is the &quot;masareal&quot; of Mandaue, Cebu which is made from finely-ground boiled peanuts, sugar or syrup (&quot;latik&quot;), and water. It is typically not as dry as the &quot;turrón&quot;, however.

A derivative but very different street food is the &quot;turón&quot;, which is a dessert version of the Filipino &quot;lumpia&quot;. The most common is the &quot;turón na saging&quot;, which are sliced banana or plantain dipped in brown sugar, wrapped in spring roll wrappers, and deep-fried. However, there are numerous other fillings of &quot;turón&quot;, including ube, sweet potato, and even peanuts, like the &quot;turón de mani&quot;.

===Puerto Rican &quot;turrón&quot;===
In Puerto Rico, &quot;turrón&quot; is called &quot;turrón de ajonjolí&quot; (sesame &quot;turrón&quot;). Puerto Rican &quot;turrón&quot; is made with toasted black and white sesame seeds, ground cinnamon, lemon juice, bound together by caramelized brown sugar and honey. Other varieties include almonds, lime zest, sunflower seeds with flax seeds, orange zest, and toasted coconut flakes.

===Cuban &quot;turrón&quot;===
In Cuba, &quot;turrón de maní&quot; (peanut nougat) is a traditional sweet treat. Snack-sized bars are usually peddled across bus stops and crowds, though family loaves of up to two pounds are also available. They run in two variants: &quot;blando&quot;, ground peanuts pressed into bars with brown sugar; and &quot;duro&quot;, coarsely chopped roasted peanuts bound together with caramelized sugar and honey.

<doc id="421900" wikidata="Q7488808" url="?curid=421900" title="Shannon's law (Arizona)">
<text>Shannon&#x27;s law refers to specific changes in Arizona statutes, enacted in 2000, making it a felony offense to discharge firearms randomly into the air.

==History==
&quot;Shannon&#x27;s law&quot; is named after Shannon Smith, a fourteen-year-old Phoenix girl killed by a stray bullet in June 1999. Smith&#x27;s parents, after being informed that the assailant&#x27;s activity constituted, at most, a misdemeanor offense, advocated stronger penalties, to prevent future incidents of this kind.

Otis and Lory Smith joined the board of directors for Arizonans for Gun Safety. They started a campaign that took them all over Arizona. Their efforts were supported by councilman Phil Gordon, the city council of Tucson, and president of the National Rifle Association Charlton Heston. After a speech by Governor Jane Dee Hull voicing her support, senate minority leader Jack A. Brown named passing the law a priority. The Arizona legislature failed to pass the bill twice in 1999, but it finally received both state senate and state house approval in April 2000. The bill was enacted that July, with Governor Hull signing the bill in the Smiths’ front yard.

==Enforcement==
Violation of &quot;Shannon&#x27;s law&quot; is defined as a class 6 felony offense in Arizona. However, as with most felony offenses in United States jurisdictions, a person charged with this offense can strike a plea bargain with prosecutors, and may be eligible for only a misdemeanor conviction. The decision of whether such an offer is available lies solely in the hands of the prosecutor, and presently these offenses are being charged as &quot;dangerous&quot; offenses, thereby making the accused ineligible for probation under state law, requiring a prison sentence even for a first offense.

On December 31, 2003, police in the city of Glendale began using equipment which alerted them to the location from which a shot was fired. As random discharge of firearms are common in some areas of the United States on New Year&#x27;s Eve, Fourth of July, and other holidays, four arrests of &quot;Shannon&#x27;s law&quot; violators were made that night, and it is expected that more Arizona police departments will receive similar equipment.

==Shannon Smith Memorial==

Shannon Smith had been an award-winning athlete and honor student, and had graduated from the eighth grade a few weeks prior to her death. While she stood in her backyard talking on the telephone with a friend, a stray bullet hit her in her head, causing instant death. Smith&#x27;s death sparked a furor among Arizona residents. Her funeral was attended by approximately 1,300 people. A sunflower monument, made with melted metal from confiscated firearms, was raised in her honor at Madison Meadows Middle School by her classmates and friends. Nearly $20,000 in donations for the monument were primarily raised by Shannon&#x27;s friends and classmates holding car washes.

<doc id="421901" wikidata="Q3490357" url="?curid=421901" title="Economy of communist Czechoslovakia">
<text>In the mid-1980s, Communist Czechoslovakia was prosperous by the standards of the Eastern Bloc, and did well in comparison to many richer western countries. Consumption of some goods like meat, eggs and bread products was even higher than the average countries in Western Europe, and the population enjoyed high macroeconomic stability and low social friction. Inhabitants of Czechoslovakia enjoyed a standard of living generally higher than that found in most other East European countries. Heavily dependent on foreign trade, the country nevertheless had one of the Eastern Bloc&#x27;s smallest international debts to non-socialist countries.

The command economy of Czechoslovakia possessed serious structural problems. Like the rest of the Eastern Bloc economies, producer goods were favored over consumer goods, causing consumer goods to be lacking in quantity and quality in the shortage economy that resulted. Economic growth rates lagged well behind Czechoslovakia&#x27;s western European counterparts. Investments made in industry did not yield the results expected. Consumption of energy and raw materials was excessive. Czechoslovak leaders themselves decried the economy&#x27;s failure to modernize with sufficient speed.

The differing statistical concepts and procedures used by socialist and non-socialist economists make an assessment of the status of the Czechoslovak economy complicated. Foreign trade statistics are particularly difficult to assess because a variety of currency conversion methods were employed to calculate trade turnover value. Data calculated on the basis of non-socialist concepts will be identified here by the use of such Western terms as gross national product; Czechoslovak statistics will be called official data or identified by such terms as net material product or national income.

==Functioning of the economy==
The Czechoslovak economy, like most economies in socialist countries, differed markedly from market or mixed economies. The main difference is that while in market economies, decisions by individual consumers and producers tend automatically to regulate supply and demand, consumption and investment, and other economic variables, in most communist economies, these variables are decided by a national plan that has the force of law.

In Czechoslovakia, like in most socialist countries, the centralized economic structure paralleled that of the government and the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (Komunistická strana Československa—KSČ). This structure gave the party firm control over the government and the economy. It is generally referred to as the Soviet model and was first applied in the Soviet Union, which was initially an agrarian nation with extensive natural resources, a large internal market, and relatively little dependence on foreign trade; the goal was to quickly develop heavy industry and defense production. Czechoslovakia, by contrast, was a small country that had already reached a high level of industrialization and was rather heavily dependent on foreign trade when the Soviet system was first imposed after World War II.

In the mid-1980s, Czechoslovakia had a highly industrialized economy, a fact reflected in the 1985 official statistics concerning production of the net material product of the country (the official measure of aggregate production). The industrial sector accounted for 59.7 percent of the value of the net material product; construction, 11.2 percent; agriculture and forestry, 7.5 percent; and various other productive services (including transport, catering, and retailing, among other activities), 21.6 percent. As of 1980 the socialist sector (state enterprises or cooperatives) generated 97.4 percent of the national income. Of the total workforce, almost 99.8 percent was employed in the socialist sector.

=== Plans and their implementation ===
Government ministries prepared general directives concerning the desired development of the economy. They passed these along to the economic advisory body, the Central Planning Commission, which in turn prepared the long-term targets of the economy. These were expressed in extensive economic plans--in general plans covering periods fifteen to twenty years into the future and in the well-known five-year plans. Since 1969, economic plans for the Czech Socialist Republic and the Slovak Socialist Republic have been produced by their own planning commissions, although the central plan remained the most important. Most significant on a daily operational basis, however, were the short-term annual production objectives. In their final form, these more detailed annual plans have the force of law, no longer being merely guides or recommendations.

In formulating the various plans, the Central Planning Commission converted the directives of the ministries into physical units, devised assignments for key sectors of the economy, and then delivered this information to the appropriate ministries, which oversee various functional branches of the economy. Upon receiving their assignments, the various ministries further subdivided the plan into tasks for the industrial enterprises and trusts or groups of enterprises under their supervision. A parallel process took place for agriculture, in which the federal Ministry of Agriculture and Food supervised the planning procedures for the collectives and state farms. Agricultural farms had been collectivized according to a process pioneered by Joseph Stalin in the late 1920s by which Marxist-Leninist regimes in the Eastern Bloc and elsewhere attempted to establish an ordered socialist system in rural agriculture. Because of the need to conceal the assumption of control and the realities of an initial lack of control, no Soviet dekulakization-style liquidation of rich peasants occurred in countries such as Czechoslovakia. Because Czechoslovakia was more industrialized than the Soviet Union, it was in a position to furnish most of the equipment and fertilizer inputs needed to ease the transition to collectivized agriculture.

The ministries provided more detailed instructions concerning fulfillment of the assignments and passed them along to the trusts and enterprises. Upon receipt of their proposed tasks, individual enterprises drew up a draft plan with the assistance of their parent trust or ministry. After receiving feedback concerning the plan, the ministries consulted again with the Central Planning Commission and, assembling all the draft plans, formulated an operational plan that could achieve the central directives. The appropriate parts of the assignments were then dispatched once again to the trusts and enterprises. This time, their acceptance by the enterprises and trusts was mandatory.

The norms included in the instructions to the enterprises usually specified the volume and kinds of production required, inputs available, a production schedule, job categories and wage rates, and a description of the centrally funded investment planned. National and republic budget levies and subsidies, profit targets and limitations, and plans for the introduction of new products and technology were also set forth in the instructions.

===Advantages and disadvantages===
Advocates of this centralized system of managing the economy contend that it has a number of advantages. In a centrally planned system, authorities can distribute resources and production targets as they choose, balancing the needs of consumption and investment on the basis of long-term goals. Planners in postwar Czechoslovakia, for example, were thus able to expand the country&#x27;s heavy industrial base as they wished. In turn, research efforts, being centrally directed, can focus on areas deemed vital to the economy&#x27;s goals. In general, central planning can make it possible for producers to take advantage of economies of scale, eliminating superfluous and wasteful activities. If planning is really effective, the system should result in virtually full employment of resources.

As critics have pointed out, however, certain aspects of the system interfere with its effective functioning. One problem is the assignment of production quotas. Planners generally must base these assignments on the past performance of enterprises. Enterprise managers, knowing that planners tend to assess enterprise performance according to completion or non-completion of assigned tasks, may be tempted to understate and misrepresent the production potential of their organizations in order to obtain an assignment they can easily handle. Also, they may have little incentive to overfulfill aspects of the current plan; such achievements might lead planners to assign a substantially more difficult or even unachievable task during the next planning period, resulting in poor performance evaluation for the enterprise. Such a disparity might call into question the validity of the information previously furnished to the planners by the enterprise managers. To ensure plan fulfillment, managers tend to exaggerate their material and labor requirements and then to hoard these inputs, especially if there is a reason to worry about punctual delivery of supplies. Furthermore, since planning under the Soviet model aims at full utilization of resources, plans are typically &quot;taut,&quot; and an ambitious manager who seeks to obtain resources beyond those needed to achieve the plan norms may find the process difficult and discouraging, if not impossible. Given the emphasis on the fulfillment of the plan, managers may also hesitate to adopt new technology, since the introduction of a new procedure might impede operations and even jeopardize plan fulfillment. Critics have also noted that central planning of production can result in an inappropriate assortment of goods from the consumers&#x27; point of view or in low-quality production.

Producer goods were favored over consumer goods, causing consumer goods to be lacking in quantity and quality in the shortage economies that resulted. Because periodic shortages of birth control pills and intrauterine devices made these systems unreliable in Czechoslovakia, abortion became the most common form of contraception . Many premium goods could be bought only in special stores using foreign currency generally inaccessible to most citizens, such as Tuzex stores in Czechoslovakia. As a result, black markets were created that were often supplied by goods stolen from the public sector. A saying in Czechoslovakia was &quot;if you do not steal form the state, you are robbing your own family.&quot; Private car ownership remained low by Western standards. The wait list for the distribution of Czechoslovak Škoda cars was up to 15 years.

In addition, because of large social purges, so many workers were dismissed from established professions in such purges that they often had to be replaced by hastily trained younger workers free of questionable class origins. A Czechoslovak noted:

Like the rest of the Eastern Bloc, Czechoslovakia effectively missed the information and electronics revolution of the 1970s and 1980s. The party-state planned system ended up collapsing under the weight of accumulated economic inefficiencies, with various attempts at reform merely contributing to the acceleration of crisis-generating tendencies. It possessed poorly defined property rights, a lack of market clearing prices and overblown or distorted productive capacities in relation to analogous market economies.

===Growth rates===
Growth rates in Czechoslovakia, as throughout the Eastern Bloc, experienced relative decline. Meanwhile, Germany, Austria, France and other Western European nations experienced increased economic growth in the Wirtschaftswunder (&quot;economic miracle&quot;), Trente Glorieuses (&quot;thirty glorious years&quot;) and the post-war boom. Overall, the inefficiency of systems without competition or market-clearing prices became costly and unsustainable, especially with the increasing complexity of world economics. While most western European economies essentially began to approach the per capita Gross Domestic Product levels of the United States, Eastern Bloc countries such as Czechoslovakia did not. Its per capita GDP fell significantly below comparable western European counterparts on an exchange basis:
Similar results occur for GDP on a PPP basis:
== History ==

===Before socialism===

In 1929, compared to 1913, the gross domestic product increased by 52% and industrial production by 41%. In 1938, Czechoslovakia was in 10th place worldwide in terms of industrial production.

After World War II the Czechoslovak economy emerged relatively undamaged. Industry, which was the largest sector of the economy, included large firms in light and heavy industry. During the war, the German occupation authorities had taken over all major industrial plants. After the war, the reconstituted Czechoslovak government took control of these plants. Immediately after the war, the Soviet Union began to transfer large amounts of industrial and other assets from Eastern Bloc countries, including Czechoslovakia. In addition, the Soviets reorganized enterprises as joint-stock companies in which the Soviets possessed the controlling interest. Using that control vehicle, several enterprises were required to sell products at below Western market prices to the Soviets, such as uranium mined in Czechoslovakia.

Foreign trade was still in private hands, however, and remained important in the economy. Exports of machinery and consumer goods paid for imports of materials for processing. The quality of Czechoslovak export products was comparable to that of products produced in other industrialized countries. Agriculture also remained in private hands, and farming was still largely a family affair. The labor force as a whole was skilled and productive, and management was competent. This mixed system, containing elements of socialism and private enterprise, operated efficiently in 1947 and 1948 under a two-year plan in which goals were general and indicative rather than mandatory. The country received considerable assistance from the West through the UN, and most of its trade was with the West. Until prohibited by Stalin in 1947, Czechoslovakia intended to participate in the United States Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe. By 1948 Czechoslovak production approximated pre-war levels, with agricultural output being somewhat lower and industrial output somewhat higher than earlier levels.

===1948–1960===

When the KSČ assumed complete political and economic control in February 1948, it began immediately to transform the Czechoslovak economy into a miniature version of that of the Soviet Union. By 1952 the government had nationalized nearly all sectors; many experienced managers had been replaced by politically reliable individuals that sometimes had little experience in the areas they were assigned to manage. Central planning provided a mandatory guide for institutions and managers to follow in nearly all economic activity.

The targets of the First Five-Year Plan (1949–53) reflected the government&#x27;s commitment to expansion of the producer goods sector of the economy. The goals were dramatically revised upwards after 1949, partly in response to the Korean War, to build up metallurgy and heavy industry. The country became an important supplier of machinery and arms to other communist countries. Foreign trade with non-communist countries dropped sharply (in part because of trade controls imposed in those countries); trade with communist countries increased from 40% of the country&#x27;s total in 1948 to 70% a decade later. The economy failed to reach the ambitious goals of the first plan, although investment and growth were high. On the results of the first five-year plan, the Great Soviet Encyclopedia claims:

&quot;The gross industrial output increased by 93 percent during the five-year plan, reaching a level more than double the 1937 output. Machine building became the leading industry, its output increasing by a factor of 3.3 over the five years. Industrial growth was especially rapid in Slovakia. At the same time, there were disproportions in the development of individual branches of the national economy, and agriculture lagged behind the growing demands of industry and the population.&quot;

By the end of the plan period, serious inflationary pressures and other imbalances had developed, requiring a currency conversion in 1953 that wiped out many people&#x27;s savings and provoked outbreaks of civil disorder.

The years 1954 and 1955 were covered by yearly plans only; the scheduling change was part of an effort by the members of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (Comecon) to correlate and integrate their planning by using common planning periods.

The Second Five-Year Plan then encompassed the years 1956–60. During that period, investment continued at a high rate, although real wages and the supply of consumer goods also increased substantially, and national income grew by 6.9%. In the late 1950s, however, economic leaders noted that investment efforts were yielding diminishing returns. Large investments were required to sustain economic growth. In 1958 and 1959, in response to this troubling situation, the government made several relatively minor adjustments in the functioning of organizations and prices—the first of the country&#x27;s economic reforms. The reforms involved some limited decentralization of authority, most notably giving enterprises more autonomy in handling investment funds. The intention was not to alter the Soviet economic model to any great extent but rather to enhance its overall operation. The reforms did not result in noticeable improvements in economic performance, however. Eventually, in 1962, planners quietly scrapped the entire reform program, reimposing most of the central controls.

On the results of the Second Five-Year Plan, the Great Soviet Encyclopedia claims:

&quot;During the second five-year plan the industrial output increased by 66 percent, rising to four times the pre-war level (1937). The national income increased by a factor of 2.5 between 1948 and 1960. The socialist sector now owned 87.4 percent of the farmland, and the organization of farmers into cooperatives was virtually completed. Nevertheless, in terms of the growth of production, agriculture lagged behind industry. The successes of socialist construction quickly raised the living standard of the people. A national conference of the Communist Party, held on July 5–7, 1960, confirmed the victory of socialist production relations in the country. Several days later, on July 11, the National Assembly adopted a new constitution under which the country was renamed the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic (CSSR). The constitution proclaimed the CSSR a socialist state based on a firm alliance, headed by the working class, of the peasantry, the working class, and the intelligentsia.&quot;

===1960s===

During the early 1960s, industrial production stagnated and the agricultural sector also registered a relatively poor performance. Agriculture had been a weak part of the economy throughout the 1950s, consistently failing to reach planned output targets, and the minimal reforms of 1958–59 had done little to alter the situation. Targets set for the national economy in the Third Five-Year Plan (1961–65) quickly proved to be overly ambitious, particularly with regard to foreign trade. The plan was dropped after a recession in 1962, and annual plans covered the remainder of the period. National income actually declined in 1963. By 1965 it was only 1.9% higher than in 1960, in comparison with a 6.9% growth rate in the 1956–60 period.

Many factors contributed to the economy&#x27;s poor performance, including adverse weather for agriculture, cancellation of orders by China resulting from the Sino-Soviet dispute, and unrealistic plan goals. By this time, however, reform-minded economists had reached the conclusion that much of the blame lay in deficiencies of the Soviet model. They began to prepare additional reform measures to improve the economy&#x27;s efficiency.

Serious defects in the Soviet model for economic development had long been recognized by some Czechoslovak economists, and calls for decentralization had occurred as early as 1954. Economists and others had argued that
it was inappropriate to apply the Soviet model to Czechoslovakia in a dogmatic manner, because:
* The country was already industrialized, had few natural resources and a small internal market, and remained dependent on foreign trade in significant ways.
*The model emphasized extensive development, such as building new factories, rather than intensive investment in which production processes were modernized and efficiency improved.
*The pressure for greater investment and defense production during the 1950s had caused private consumption to grow more slowly than net material product. The result had been a chronic inflationary bias, reflected in shortages of consumer goods and forced savings by the population.
*Plants and construction firms held large inventories of materials to compensate for irregular deliveries from suppliers.
*Completion of most investment projects required an inordinate amount of time, freezing funds in unproductive uses.
*Inadequate investment in agriculture had contributed to the latter&#x27;s chronically poor performance.
*Prices were also a problem, based as they were on often conflicting policies; prices reflected neither scarcity nor cost, bore little rational relationship to one another in the domestic market, and had become increasingly divorced from world prices.
*The system appeared to stifle innovation and to offer no basis for selecting between investment and production alternatives or for judging efficiency.

By the early 1960s, several Czechoslovak economists had analyzed these problems and had remedies to offer. In October 1964, the party published a set of principles for major economic reform and, beginning in 1965, started implementing specific measures. In June 1966, the Thirteenth Party Congress gave its official approval to the new program, which came to be called the New Economic Model (NEM). The implementation of the reform started in 1967 and it accelerated the political developments of 1968. The reform program was multifaceted, and portions of it were never implemented. Its principal object was to limit significantly the role of the central planning authorities while expanding the autonomy and responsibility of the enterprises:
*The central planning authorities were to concern themselves only with overall long-term planning and to provide general guidance.
*Enterprises and their associations would be free to determine short-term production targets.
*Individual enterprises were to become financially viable, realizing a profit from their sales.
*State subsidies would gradually end; enterprises that could not operate at a profit would have to close.
*Profit, rather than fulfillment of planned quantitative output targets, was to become the main criterion for evaluating the economic performance of enterprises.
*Producers were to be increasingly exposed to foreign competition, so that they would seek to increase their own productivity and lower prices.
*As a means of earning much- needed hard currencies, exports to Western countries were to be stimulated through incentives encouraging enterprises to make their products competitive on world markets.
* A more realistic system of prices was to replace the centrally determined system. Prices were to reflect actual costs, the supply and demand situation, and relevant world prices. Enterprises were to finance investments with their own resources and interest-bearing bank loans and would have to justify their investments in terms of need, effectiveness, and cost so that widespread waste of investment resources would cease.
*Finally, a revised wage and salary system was to eliminate egalitarianism in the wage structure and substitute a system based on individual work performance and on results obtained by the employing enterprise.

Furthermore, the government consolidated enterprises into large production units resembling trusts or cartels managed by &quot;branch directorates.&quot; These large production units formed an intermediate link between the enterprises and the ministries. The branch directorates had overall responsibility for the performance of enterprises under their jurisdiction, but the division of authority between the larger unit or trust and its subordinate members was not clearly defined. In the spring of 1968, the government permitted enterprises to experiment with worker participation in management through the establishment of enterprise councils.

Czechoslovak reformers did not intend to permit free play of market forces. They had implemented only a portion of their program by August 1968, when Soviet and other Warsaw Pact troops invaded the country and the reform experiment came to an end. The next two years saw the gradual dismantling of most of the program. By the early 1970s, almost all traces of the reform measures had vanished.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Czechoslovak economy continued to grow at a respectable rate throughout the period. From 1966 to 1970, the period of the Fourth Five-Year Plan, net material product grew at an average annual rate of 6.9%, well exceeding the planned yearly increase of 4.1 to 4.4%.

===1970s===
Economic &quot;normalization&quot; resulted in a reversion to mandatory central planning and price controls. Only a few modifications of the central planning system remained, including devolution of some aspects of planning to the consolidated production units and modification of some plan indicators to emphasize efficiency, productivity, quality, and innovation rather than simply gross output targets.

Performance was still gratifying during the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1971–75). During this period, net material product grew somewhat more slowly, averaging 5.7% yearly, but still exceeded the planned rate of 5.1% yearly. Wages, incomes, and personal consumption levels rose at respectable rates despite an overall increase in investment. Agriculture continued to be a weak area but had improved markedly. By 1975 the agricultural sector was almost self-sufficient in animal production, and self- sufficiency in crop production appeared to be an attainable goal. Rural wages rose, and mechanization progressed rapidly.

During the Sixth Five-Year Plan (1976–80), by contrast, economic performance was far less satisfactory; in the closing years of the period, the slowdown in economic growth became especially noticeable. Net material product grew by only 3.7% yearly on average, instead of the 4.9% called for by the plan. Both agriculture and industry and productivity increase failed to meet planned growth targets Problems in agriculture were in part a result of drought (1976) and severe winter and spring flooding (1979). Other factors, such as shortages of agricultural machinery and spare parts and poor quality of fertilizer, also affected the agricultural sector. Large imports of grain necessarily continued. During the plan period, growth rates in personal consumption declined, reaching a low point of 0.5% in 1979. At the same time, in contrast to the previous plan period, retail prices rose by about 11% over the 5-year period. During the last few years of the plan, there were widespread consumer complaints about the unavailability of basic commodities such as meat, milk, and vegetables. The economy&#x27;s performance was lackluster despite the continuing infusion of substantial investment funds. In part, the rise in the investment rate in the 1970s reflected large capital expenditures for increased mining of coal and other fuels and for the development of engineering branches to produce equipment for nuclear power plants. Nevertheless, given the considerable funding poured into the economy, the mediocre condition of the Czechoslovak industrial plant in general at the end of the 1970s must have been discouraging to economic planners.

The energy and trade problems Czechoslovakia faced in the late 1970s were also major factors in the slowdown in industrial growth. The terms on which Czechoslovakia conducted foreign trade had begun to deteriorate sharply by the mid-1970s. After 1974 the rapid rise of world oil prices was partially reflected in the price of oil from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia&#x27;s principal source of fuel and raw materials. Prices of other materials on which the country&#x27;s economy depended also increased faster than the prices of its exports, which consisted primarily of manufactured goods (especially machinery). Party and government leaders were cautious about increasing foreign indebtedness and attempted to maintain a high level of exports. Increasingly in the 1970s, a substantial portion of the country&#x27;s production of consumer goods and machinery was diverted to export markets to meet the rising import bill. Restraints on imports from noncommunist countries reduced inputs for domestic industries.

===1980–1985===
At the beginning of the 1980s, the economy had substantial limitations, which were recognized by economists, political leaders, and even the public at large. The country had perhaps the oldest stock of plant and equipment in Eastern Europe, a stagnant resource base, and growing dependence on energy and material imports. To reduce requirements for energy and raw materials and to increase the competitiveness of Czechoslovak exports, domestic production needed to become more efficient. Furthermore, consumption standards continued to be well below those found in Western Europe.

Economic planners set relatively modest growth targets for the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1981–1985), revising their goals downward two years into the plan. &quot;Intensification&quot; of the economy—focusing on efficient use of resources rather than simply quantitative growth—was the keynote of government policy. The early years of the Seventh Five-Year Plan saw a serious slump in the economy. During 1981 and 1982, personal consumption actually declined. The cost of living rose more rapidly than wages. During the final three years, however, an economic recovery made up for the earlier poor performances; according to official calculations, the country succeeded in either meeting or surpassing domestic goals during the plan period as a whole. Results of the &quot;intensification&quot; effort were disappointing, however, as leaders acknowledged. During the plan, consumption of energy decreased by only 1.7% per annum, less than the 2% goal of the plan .

The relatively favorable outcome of the Seventh Five-Year Plan was noteworthy, particularly because several international trends had had negative effects on the Czechoslovak economy during the period. A recession in developed Western countries dampened their markets for Czechoslovak exports; and in 1981 the Soviet Union announced its intention to scale back oil exports to Eastern Europe, including Czechoslovakia, by 10%. Although in 1983 and 1984 worldwide prices for oil began to drop, the Comecon (or Soviet) price, tied to a 5-year formula, caused the price of Soviet oil (16.4 million of the 16.6 million tons imported by Czechoslovakia in 1984) to continue to climb. In 1982 the decision of Western banks to restrict credit to Eastern Europe as a result of Poland&#x27;s serious payment problems and the sizable debts of other East European countries impeded Czechoslovakia&#x27;s foreign trade with the West.

The poor performance of the economy in the early 1980s persuaded party leaders that some changes were needed. Therefore, in conjunction with the Seventh Five-Year Plan, in 1981 the government introduced a series of limited reforms called the &quot;Set of Measures to Improve the System of Planned National Economic Management after 1980.&quot; Relatively conservative in design and initiated without fanfare, these reforms permitted somewhat greater freedom of action for managers of enterprises in selected operational areas, giving them more authority over their own investment activities and over providing financial incentives to workers. The intention was to make industry as a whole more aware of prices and costs. The reforms did not call for any appreciable loosening of central planning and control. In 1982 parallel reform measures were introduced for agriculture; the measures permitted farm officials to exercise greater management initiative and limited the number of binding targets imposed on farm production. Many Western observers believed that these reforms did have a helpful effect during the final years of the plan. It was felt, however, that these partial reforms were not sufficiently comprehensive to bring about the modernization and improvements in efficiency sought by Czechoslovakia&#x27;s leaders.

===1986–1989===
The Eighth Five-Year Plan called for further &quot;intensification&quot; within the economy. The plan focused on raising the quality and technological level of production, lowering the cost of energy and materials in relation to output, increasing labor productivity, accelerating the pace of innovation at the workplace, improving discipline, and continuing the &quot;structural&quot; shift of the economy from productive activities requiring great consumption of energy to more advanced technologies and capitalintensive industry. National income was to rise 19%, or just over 3.5% annually on average. Plans called for industrial output to grow 15.8%, an average increase of about 3% yearly, while personal consumption was to grow by only 11.9%. Modest as these targets were, they were higher than the results achieved during the Seventh Five-Year Plan. Only agriculture was to grow at a rate slower than that of the previous plan period; with a total increase of 6.9%, it would average just over 1% growth annually. Investment, while still low, would increase 10.4% during the plan (as compared with 2.5% in the 1981–85 period). Special attention was to be given to the machine-building and electronics industries, the chemical and metallurgical industries, construction of nuclear power plants and expansion of the natural gas network, and environment-related projects. The plan called for exports to grow at a higher rate than the national income. The government did not plan any substantial borrowing in hard currency, concentrating instead on paying off its relatively modest (US$2 billion) debt to the West.

In the mid-1980s, Czechoslovak leaders acknowledged the persisting weaknesses in the country&#x27;s economy and its need to modernize more rapidly. Although the government announced no major reforms in conjunction with the Eighth Five-Year Plan, in 1987 an experiment was begun involving about 120 industrial enterprises. These enterprises were to receive only key planning figures from the central authorities; otherwise, they were to have increased autonomy in planning production, seeking profitable forms for their activities, and managing their own finances. The reforms represented a significant step beyond the modest &quot;Set of Measures&quot; of 1981, which had retained strict central controls. This was a cautious response to the more ambitious reforms sponsored by General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev in the Soviet Union.

&quot;Data on late 1987 to 1989 need to be added&quot;.

==Financial system and banking==

=== Currency===

The koruna (Kčs), or crown, was the national currency and consisted of 100 haléřů. In 1986 the currency continued to be convertible only under restricted conditions and at official rates. Violation of exchange regulations constituted a serious offense. The koruna could be used only within the country and was not used in foreign trade. In 1987 the official, or commercial, exchange rate was Kcs5.4 per US$l; the tourist, or noncommercial, rate was Kcs10.5 per US$l. The koruna was legally defined in terms of 123 milligrams of gold, which provided a historical basis for the commercial rate.

===Banking system===

* At the head of the country&#x27;s banking system was the State Bank of Czechoslovakia. The State Bank was the central bank, the government&#x27;s financial agent, the country&#x27;s commercial bank, an investment bank, and the clearing agent for collection notices. It also supervised the other banking in the country and, in conjunction with specific ministries, formulated the financial plan for Czechoslovakia. The other banks, also state owned, were subordinate to the State Bank and relegated to special functions.
*The Commercial Bank of Czechoslovakia was primarily the bank for foreign currency transactions.
*Three additional banks—two of which were savings banks, one for each of the republics, providing credit to individuals—completed the banking system in 1980.

The main function of the banking system was to act as the government&#x27;s agent in implementing the financial plan, an important part of which consisted of expanding and contracting credit to meet the economy&#x27;s needs. The central authorities controlled most investments directly, and the national plan regulated production. The State Bank acted as a supervisory agent in extending credit to the enterprises, ensuring that the investments met plan goals. The bulk of bank credit was for working capital, largely utilized to finance the purchase of materials and the sale of finished products. The powers of the State Bank appeared to be somewhat limited, however, since credit was extended according to guidelines for planned production.

The central authorities set interest rates, which neither reflected the cost of capital nor appreciably affected the flow of credit. Instead, beginning in the 1970s, interest rates were differentiated to accomplish objectives of the plan. Interest rates were low for enterprises modernizing a production process. Punitive rates were used if firms deviated from plan goals. In the mid-1980s, the greatest portion of investment credits went to the industrial sector, followed by agriculture, construction, and retail trade.

The banking system operated within the framework of the financial plan. Major elements of the financial plan included allocation to consumption and investment, foreign and domestic financing of investment, and wage and price changes. Planning authorities were in a position to use the centralized banking system to carry out major corrective measures, as occurred in 1953 when inflationary pressures became serious and the population&#x27;s accumulated savings were largely wiped out by a conversion of the currency. After this experience, officials placed stricter controls on investments, permitting real wages and the standard of living to rise gradually. But in the late 1970s, and particularly in the early 1980s, the worsening terms of trade, bottlenecks in the economy, and the need for large investments in energy and industry combined to limit the allocations for consumption.

===Inflation and prices===
Imposition of the Soviet model introduced a chronic inflationary bias into the Czechoslovak economy, although the inflation was not necessarily reflected in prices. Control of prices (only private food produce, especially fruit and vegetables, were priced freely) repeatedly produced inflationary manifestations in other areas, such as shortages in the market and increased savings by the population. Although officials generally limited the rise in prices (causing price indexes to advance slowly), by the mid-1970s prices had to be adjusted upward more frequently. This trend continued into the 1980s, and major food price increases occurred in 1982.

===Budget and taxes===
In addition to the banking system, another major financial tool for implementing economic policies and the annual plan was the central and republic government budgets. The Czechoslovak government published little budget information. Western observers believed that small surpluses of revenues were more common than deficits, however. Budget revenues were derived primarily from state economic organizations and the turnover tax. Income taxes provided a small part of revenues. Other minor revenue sources included agricultural taxes and customs duties. The planning authorities redistributed these budget funds according to the plan guidelines, using the budget to encourage certain sectors through subsidies or investment funds.

Central authorities set prices on over 1.5 million kinds of goods. State enterprises were theoretically autonomous financial entities that covered costs and profits from sales. Because the government set production quotas, wage rates, and prices for the products manufactured and the inputs used in the process, however, managers had little freedom to manage. In the 1950s, the government had collected nearly all enterprise funds above costs for redirection according to its priorities. After the 1958 reforms, enterprises obtained a little more control over surplus funds, although the government continued to control the amount of the surplus. In the 1980s, the government was encouraging enterprises to undertake modernization and other limited investment from their own funds and bank credit and to rely less on budget funds.

The turnover tax, another major source of budget revenue, was originally employed in the Soviet Union as a simple and effective method of collecting most of the funds needed by the government without requiring extensive bookkeeping and estimating. It was introduced in Czechoslovakia in 1953 and lost its importance as the chief source of revenue only in the late 1960s, when other levies extracted funds from state enterprises. The tax was collected on goods destined for retail, the rate varying according to the difference between the producer&#x27;s costs plus approved margin and the selling price as specified by pricing officials. Retail prices of manufactured consumer goods, such as clothing and particularly tobacco products, alcoholic beverages, and sugar, were substantially higher than those of such basic necessities as potatoes, milk, and eggs. The turnover tax appeared to be both a source of revenue and a tool used to influence consumption patterns.

<text>John Cary (c. 1754 – 1835) was an English cartographer.

== Life ==
Cary served his apprenticeship as an engraver in London, before setting up his own business in the Strand in 1783. He soon gained a reputation for his maps and globes, his atlas, &quot;The New and Correct English Atlas&quot; published in 1787, becoming a standard reference work in England.

In 1794 Cary was commissioned by the Postmaster General to survey England&#x27;s roads. This resulted in &quot;Cary&#x27;s New Itinerary&quot; (1798), a map of all the major roads in England and Wales. He also produced Ordnance Survey maps prior to 1805.

In his later life he collaborated on geological maps with the geologist William Smith. His business was eventually taken over by G. F. Cruchley (1822–1880).

== Works ==
Cary&#x27;s major works include:

*&quot;Actual Survey of the country fifteen miles around London&quot; (1786)
*&quot;New and Correct English Atlas&quot; (1787)
*&quot;Camden&#x27;s Britannia&quot; (1789) - maps for 1789 and 1806 editions

<doc id="421911" wikidata="Q6028206" url="?curid=421911" title="Industry of Communist Czechoslovakia">
<text>The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic (1948–1989) greatly developed an already substantial industrial base, and became an important supplier of industrial products to other Comecon nations. However, despite attempted remedial measures, Czechoslovak industry was lagging behind the West by the mid-1980s: it was energy-intensive, innovation and investment in new plant were insufficient, and labor productivity was low.

==History==
Czechoslovakia inherited the bulk of existing industrial assets following the breakup of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after World War I. Industrialization continued in the interwar years. Even before World War II, the country&#x27;s armaments and heavy industries were producing commodities accepted throughout the world. World War II left Czechoslovak industrial facilities largely intact. In the late 1940s, Czechoslovakia was one of the most industrialized countries in the world, and the quality of its products was comparable to that of other industrialized countries.

After the KSC took control of the country, the industrial sector — particularly defense and heavy industry — received priority in terms of investment funds, labor, and materials. Industry was the leading sector in the expansion of the economy. The industrial base grew rapidly, as recorded by the official index of industrial production. Starting from a base of 100 in 1948, the index increased to 371.9 in 1960 and 665.5 in 1970. The late 1970s witnessed some deceleration in industrial growth, and the index increased from 921.4 in 1975 to 1,156.7 in 1980. In 1985 the index reached 1,322. The figures suggested substantial growth, and industry&#x27;s overall performance since World War II had in fact been impressive.

During the 1970s, Czechoslovakia had signed specialization and joint investment agreements with other Comecon members, committing the country to specific long-term obligations, in particular production branches (machine tools and railroad locomotives, for example), partly to ensure the inflow of energy and raw materials.

In 1985 the most important branches of industry in terms of the monetary value of their contribution to the economy were machinery, electrical engineering, metalworking, chemicals, asbestos, rubber, and ferrous metallurgy (including ore extraction). Important manufactured products were vehicles, railroad goods, aircraft, electrical goods, heavy machinery, and precision equipment.

In the 1980s, Czechoslovakia was — except for the Soviet Union — Eastern Europe&#x27;s only builder of heavy-duty nuclear power equipment and was a joint supplier of such products to other Comecon members. For export, Czechoslovakia specialized in smaller units, while the Soviet Union supplied the larger-capacity reactors.

In the early and mid-1980s, as part of an effort to &quot;restructure&quot; the industrial economy, the government sought to reduce the relative importance of metallurgy within the industrial sector, cutting back particularly on such traditional products as pig iron, raw steel, and rolled ferrous products in favor of more profitable and less energy-intensive branches.

== Problems ==
Despite its favored position within the economy, the industrial sector had serious weaknesses in the mid-1980s:
* A particularly significant problem was the high energy and material inputs required for a unit of industrial output. Czechoslovak machinery was often heavier than comparable West European equipment and was usually less productive. The slow rate of technological innovation had caused a decline in the country&#x27;s share of machinery markets in developing nations, noncommunist industrialized countries, and Comecon countries in comparison with the 1950s.
* Related problems were design limitations and lengthy project completion times, which frequently caused investments to be less productive than hoped.
* In addition, old equipment was retired slowly. In 1986 the average age of industrial machinery and equipment was 12 years; 10 percent of the machinery was more than 25 years old, and the percentage was reportedly increasing.
* Political hindrance made exportation of luxury cars like Tatra 613 impossible to private western buyers.
* Imbalances persisted between supply and demand, both at home and on foreign markets.

In 1986 a prominent Czechoslovak economist argued that industry&#x27;s problems stemmed in part from inadequate specialization, insufficient use of foreign licenses, and cumbersome restraints on research projects.
The above circumstances contributed to the low productivity of Czechoslovak workers compared with their counterparts in Western Europe.

Most of these problems had already existed in some form during the 1970s, and the government had introduced several measures intended to correct the deficiencies. Laws introduced in 1971 (which went into effect in 1975) had granted limited powers and a degree of decentralization to the intermediate level of administration, positioned between ministries and production enterprises. The intermediate level consisted of associations of industrial enterprises in the same or closely related branches, resembling trusts. The intent was to reduce overhead expenditures, such as planning and research, while promoting innovation and technological development. Changes also were introduced in the wage and price systems in an attempt to improve efficiency. Despite these measures, there was reason for continuing dissatisfaction in the 1980s.

<text>In music, the terms additive and divisive are used to distinguish two types of both rhythm and meter:

* A divisive (or, alternately, multiplicative) rhythm is a rhythm in which a larger period of time is divided into smaller rhythmic units or, conversely, some integer unit is regularly multiplied into larger, equal units.
* This can be contrasted with additive rhythm, in which larger periods of time are constructed by concatenating (joining end to end) a series of units into larger units of unequal length, such as a meter produced by the regular alternation of and .

When applied to meters, the terms &quot;perfect&quot; and &quot;imperfect&quot; are sometimes used as the equivalents of &quot;divisive&quot; and &quot;additive&quot;, respectively .

For example, 4 may be evenly divided by 2 or reached by adding 2 + 2. In contrast, 5 is only evenly divisible by 5 and 1 and may be reached by adding 2 or 3. Thus, (or, more commonly, ) is divisive while is additive.

The terms &quot;additive&quot; and &quot;divisive&quot; originate with Curt Sachs&#x27;s book &quot;Rhythm and Tempo&quot; (1953), while the term &quot;aksak rhythm&quot; was introduced for the former concept at about the same time by Constantin Brăiloiu, in agreement with the Turkish musicologist Ahmet Adnan Saygun. The relationship between additive and divisive rhythms is complex, and the terms are often used in imprecise ways. In his article on rhythm in the second edition of the &quot;New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians,&quot; Justin London states that:

Winold recommends that, &quot;metric structure is best described through detailed analysis of pulse groupings on various levels rather than through attempts to represent the organization with a single term&quot;.

Sub-Saharan African music and most European (Western) music is divisive, while Indian and other Asian musics may be considered as primarily additive. However, many pieces of music cannot be clearly labeled divisive or additive.

==Divisive rhythm==

For example: consists of one measure (whole note: 1) divided into a stronger first beat and slightly less strong second beat (half notes: 1, 3), which are in turn divided, by two weaker beats (quarter notes: 1, 2, 3, 4), and again divided into still weaker beats (eighth notes: 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp;).

Additive rhythm features nonidentical or irregular durational groups following one another at two levels, within the bar and between bars or groups of bars. This type of rhythm is also referred to in musicological literature by the Turkish word &quot;aksak&quot;, which means &quot;limping&quot;. In the special case of time signatures in which the upper numeral is not divisible by two or three without a fraction, the result may alternatively be called &quot;irregular&quot;, &quot;imperfect&quot;, or &quot;uneven&quot; meter, and the groupings into twos and threes are sometimes called &quot;long beats&quot; and &quot;short beats&quot;.

The term &quot;additive rhythm&quot; is also often used to refer to what are also incorrectly called &quot;asymmetric rhythms&quot; and even &quot;irregular rhythms&quot; – that is, meters which have a regular pattern of beats of uneven length. For example, the time signature indicates each bar is eight quavers long, and has four beats, each a crotchet (that is, two quavers) long. The asymmetric time signature , on the other hand, while also having eight quavers in a bar, divides them into three beats, the first three quavers long, the second three quavers long, and the last just two quavers long.

These kinds of rhythms are used, for example, by Béla Bartók, who was influenced by similar rhythms in Bulgarian Folk Music. The third movement of Bartók&#x27;s String Quartet No. 5, a scherzo marked &quot;alla bulgarese&quot; features a &quot; rhythm (4+2+3)&quot;. Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Octet&quot; for Wind Instruments &quot;ends with a jazzy 3+3+2 = 8 swung coda&quot;. Stravinsky himself found a kinship with additive rhythms in music of the renaissance and baroque periods. For example, he marvelled at the &quot;Laudate Pueri&quot; from Monteverdi&#x27;s Vespers of 1610, where the music follows the natural accentuation of the Latin words to create metrical groupings of twos, threes and fours at the very start: &quot;I know of no music before or since…. which so felicitously exploits accentual and metrical variation and irregularity, and no more subtle rhythmic construction of any kind than that which is set in motion at the beginning of the &#x27;Laudate Pueri,’ if, that is, the music is sung according to the verbal accents instead of... the editor&#x27;s bar-lines&quot;.

Additive patterns also occur in some music of Philip Glass, and other minimalists, most noticeably the &quot;one-two-one-two-three&quot; chorus parts in &quot;Einstein on the Beach&quot;. They may also occur in passing in pieces which are on the whole in conventional meters. In jazz, Dave Brubeck&#x27;s song &quot;Blue Rondo à la Turk&quot; features bars of nine quavers grouped into patterns of at the start. George Harrison&#x27;s song &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; on The Beatles&#x27; album &quot;Abbey Road&quot; features a rhythm &quot;which switches between , and on the bridge&quot;. &quot;The special effect of running even eighth notes accented as if triplets against the grain of the underlying backbeat is carried to a point more reminiscent of Stravinsky than of the Beatles&quot;.

Olivier Messiaen made extensive use of additive rhythmic patterns, much of it stemming from his close study of the rhythms of Indian music. His &quot;Danse de la fureur, pour les sept trompettes&quot; from &quot;The Quartet for the End of Time&quot; is a bracing example. A gentler exploration of additive patterns can be found in &quot;Le Regard de la Vierge&quot; from the same composer&#x27;s piano cycle &quot;Vingt regards sur l&#x27;enfant-Jésus&quot;.

György Ligeti&#x27;s Étude No. 13, &quot;L&#x27;escalier du diable&quot; features patterns involving quavers grouped in twos and threes. The rhythm at the start of the study follows the pattern , then . According to the composer&#x27;s note, the time signature &quot;serves only as a guideline, the actual meter consists of 36 quavers (three &#x27;bars&#x27;), divided asymmetrically&quot;.

==Sub-Saharan African rhythm==
A divisive form of cross-rhythm is the basis for most Sub-Saharan African music traditions. Rhythmic patterns are generated by simultaneously dividing a span of musical time by a triple-beat scheme and a duple-beat scheme.

In the development of cross rhythm, there are some selected rhythmic materials or beat schemes that are customarily used. These beat schemes, in their generic forms, are simple divisions of the same musical period in equal units, producing varying rhythmic densities or motions. At the center of a core of rhythmic traditions within which the composer conveys his ideas is the technique of cross-rhythm. The technique of cross-rhythm is a simultaneous use of contrasting rhythmic patterns within the same scheme of accents or meter... By the very nature of the desired resultant rhythm, the main beat scheme cannot be separated from the secondary beat scheme. It is the interplay of the two elements that produces the cross-rhythmic texture.

&quot;the entire African rhythmic structure... is divisive in nature&quot;.

==Tresillo: divisive and additive interpretations==

In divisive form, the strokes of tresillo contradict the beats. In additive form, the strokes of tresillo &quot;are&quot; the beats. From a metrical perspective then, the two ways of perceiving tresillo constitute two different rhythms. On the other hand, from the perspective of simply the pattern of attack-points, tresillo is a shared element of traditional folk music from the northwest tip of Africa to southeast tip of Asia.

===Additive structure===
&quot;Tresillo&quot; is also found within a wide geographic belt stretching from Morocco in North Africa to Indonesia in South Asia. Use of the pattern in Moroccan music can be traced back to slaves brought north across the Sahara Desert from present-day Mali. This pattern may have migrated east from North Africa to Asia through the spread of Islam. In Middle Eastern and Asian music, the figure is generated through additive rhythm.

:&lt;score&gt;
\new RhythmicStaff {
 \clef percussion
 \time 8/16
 \autoBeamOff
 \repeat volta 2 { c8. c c8 }
&lt;/score&gt;
===Divisive structure===
The most basic duple-pulse figure found in the Music of Africa and music of the African diaspora is a figure the Cubans call &quot;tresillo&quot;, a Spanish word meaning &#x27;triplet&#x27; (three equal beats in the same time as two main beats). However, in the vernacular of Cuban popular music, the term refers to the figure shown below.

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\new RhythmicStaff {
 \clef percussion
 \time 2/4 \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;woodblock&quot;
 \repeat volta 2 { c8. c16 r8 c }
&lt;/score&gt;

African-based music has a divisive rhythm structure. Tresillo is generated through cross-rhythm: 8 pulses ÷ 3 = 2 cross-beats (consisting of three pulses each), with a remainder of a partial cross-beat (spanning two pulses). In other words, 8 ÷ 3 = 2, r2. Tresillo is a cross-rhythmic fragment.

Because of its irregular pattern of attack-points, &quot;tresillo&quot; in African and African-based musics has been mistaken for a form of additive rhythm.

Although the difference between the two ways of notating this rhythm may seem small, they stem from fundamentally different conceptions. Those who wish to convey a sense of the rhythm&#x27;s background [main beats], and who understand the surface morphology in relation to a regular subsurface articulation, will prefer the divisive format. Those who imagine the addition of three, then three, then two sixteenth notes will treat the well-formedness of 3 + 3 + 2 as fortuitous, a product of grouping rather than of metrical structure. They will be tempted to deny that African music has a bona fide metrical structure because of its frequent departures from normative grouping structure.

<text>USS &quot;Nautilus&quot; (SF-9/SS-168), a and one of the &quot;V-boats&quot;, was the third ship of the United States Navy to bear the name.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Nautilus&quot; was originally named and designated &quot;V-6&quot; (SF-9), but was redesignated and given hull classification symbol SC-2 on 11 February 1925. Her keel was laid on 10 May 1927 by the Mare Island Naval Shipyard of Vallejo, California. She was launched on 15 March 1930 sponsored by Miss Joan Keesling, and commissioned on 1 July 1930. It was the first of many submarines built at Mare Island CA.

==Design==
The configuration of &quot;V-4&quot;, &quot;V-5&quot;, and &quot;V-6&quot; resulted from an evolving strategic concept that increasingly emphasized the possibility of a naval war with Japan in the far western Pacific. This factor, and the implications of the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, suggested the need for long-range submarine &quot;cruisers&quot;, or &quot;strategic scouts&quot;, as well as long-range minelayers, for which long endurance, not high speed, was most important. The design was possibly influenced by the German &quot;U-cruisers&quot; of the Type U-139 and Type U-151 U-boat classes, although &quot;V-4&quot;, &quot;V-5&quot;, and &quot;V-6&quot; were all larger than these. A raised gun platform was provided around the conning tower, and deck stowage for spare torpedoes was included under the platform and in the superstructure. &quot;V-6&quot; and her near-sisters &quot;V-4&quot; () and &quot;V-5&quot; () were initially designed with larger and more powerful MAN-designed diesel engines than the Busch-Sulzer engines that propelled earlier V-boats, which were failures. Unfortunately, the specially built engines failed to produce their design power, and some developed dangerous crankcase explosions. The engineering plant was replaced in 1941-42.

The as-built engine specifications were two BuEng-built, MAN-designed direct-drive 10-cylinder 4-cycle main diesel engines, each, with two BuEng MAN 4-cycle 6-cylinder auxiliary diesel engines, each, driving electrical generators. The auxiliary engines were for charging batteries or for increased surface speed via a diesel-electric system providing power to the main electric motors.

Similar to her sister built at Portsmouth, V-6 was built to a partial welded/partial riveted construction method. Welding was used to join the vertical keel plates, and also in other non-critical areas like the superstructure, piping brackets, and support framing. The inner and outer hulls were still entirely riveted.

==Inter-war period==

&quot;V-6&quot; operated out of New London, conducting special submergence tests, until March 1931. She was renamed &quot;Nautilus&quot; on 19 February and given hull number SS-168 on 1 July. She proceeded to Pearl Harbor where she became flagship of Submarine Division 12 (SubDiv 12). Reassigned to SubDiv 13 at San Diego, California, 1935–1938, then re-homeported at Pearl Harbor, she maintained a regular schedule of training activities and fleet exercises and problems throughout the decade. In July 1941, she entered the Mare Island Naval Shipyard for modernization – radio equipment, external torpedo tubes (two bow and two stern-firing in the gun deck), re-engining (with four Winton diesels), and air conditioning – until the following spring.

==First patrol – the Battle of Midway==
She departed San Francisco, California, on 21 April 1942, reaching Pearl Harbor on 28 April. On 24 May, &quot;Nautilus&quot; (commanded by Lieutenant Commander William H. Brockman Jr.) got underway for her first war patrol, to Midway Island to help repel the expected attack by the Japanese fleet.

At 07:55, 4 June, while approaching the northern boundary of her patrol area near Midway Island, she sighted masts on the horizon. Japanese planes sighted the submarine at the same time and began strafing. After diving to , she continued observation. At 08:00, a formation of four enemy ships was sighted: the battleship , the cruiser , and two destroyers (misidentified, as they often were early in the war, as cruisers) in company. Within minutes the submarine was again sighted from the air and was bombed. Two of the &quot;cruisers&quot; closed for a kill and nine depth charges were dropped at a distance of about .

When the attack ceased, &quot;Nautilus&quot; rose to periscope depth. Ships surrounded her. Sighting on &quot;Kirishima&quot;, she fired two bow tubes; one misfired, one missed. At 08:30, a destroyer immediately headed for the boat, which dived to to wait out the depth charge attack. At 08:46, periscope depth was again ordered. The cruiser and two of the destroyers were now out of range; echo ranging by the third appeared too accurate for comfort. At 09:00, the periscope was raised again and an aircraft carrier was sighted. &quot;Nautilus&quot; changed course to close for an attack. The enemy destroyer followed suit and at 09:18 attacked with six depth charges.

By 09:55 echo ranging ceased and &quot;Nautilus&quot; raised her periscope. The carrier, her escorts, and the attacking destroyer had disappeared. (Unbeknownst to her skipper at the time, the counter-attacking , in her rush to rejoin the carrier, was tracked by &#x27;s VB-6, led by Wade McClusky, back to the Japanese task force.) At 12:53, a damaged aircraft carrier with two escorts was sighted. The carrier was identified as , but later research suggests it was probably . An hour later, &quot;Nautilus&quot; had moved into attack position. Between 13:59 and 14:05, after the battle was largely over, &quot;Nautilus&quot; launched four torpedoes at the carrier from less than . One failed to run, two ran erratically, and the fourth was a dud (a familiar problem for the Mark XIV), impacting amidships and breaking in half. &quot;Nautilus&quot; reported flames appeared along the length of the ship as the first hit, and the skeleton crew which had been aboard (survivors of which reported no torpedo hit) began going over the side, with the air flask of the dud torpedo acting as a life preserver for Japanese sailors.

&quot;Nautilus&quot; went to as a prolonged depth charge attack commenced. At 16:10, the submarine rose to periscope depth. The carrier, burning along her entire length, had been abandoned. At 19:41, &quot;Nautilus&quot; resumed her patrol, having expended five torpedoes and survived 42 depth charges, but accomplished little of substance. (Not until much later was the importance of her attack on the battleship, and its connection to McClusky, recognized.) Brockman was awarded a Navy Cross for his actions.
Between 7 June and 9 June, &quot;Nautilus&quot; replenished at Midway Island and then resumed her patrol to the west. By 20 June, she was operating off Honshū at the northern end of the Tokyo-Marshall Islands supply route. On 22 June, she damaged a destroyer guarding the entrance to the Sagami Sea off Ōshima. Three days later, she sank the destroyer and damaged an oil tanker. On 27 June, she sent a sampan to the bottom and on 28 June, after damaging a merchantman, underwent her severest depth charging, which forced her back to Pearl Harbor for repairs, 11 July to 7 August.

==Second patrol – the Makin Raid==
&quot;Nautilus&quot; departed Hawaiian waters for her second war patrol, a special troop transport mission of three weeks duration, 8 August. Sailing with submarine and carrying the Second Raider Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Evans F. Carlson (the Marine Raiders, or &quot;Carlson&#x27;s Raiders&quot;) she arrived off Makin Atoll on 16 August to stage a raid to divert Japanese attention from the Solomon Islands. Early the following morning, she sent the Raiders ashore on Butaritari Island in rubber boats rigged with outboard motors. At 07:03, she provided gunfire support against enemy positions at Ukiangong Point on Butaritari and shelled enemy ships in the lagoon, sinking two, a troop barge and a patrol boat. At 10:39, an enemy plane appeared and &quot;Nautilus&quot; dove. Two aerial attacks followed at 11:30 and at 12:55. The latter flight was made up of 12 planes, two of which landed in the lagoon to discharge troops. About 35 of the reinforcements made it to shore to fire on the Americans.

The Marines began to withdraw at 17:00. At 19:00, they launched their boats. Many were unable to clear the breakers without the aid of their damaged outboards. Only seven boats and less than 100 men returned that night. The remainder, less nine who were later captured and executed, discovered there were no Japanese left to fight and crossed to the lagoon side, whence they headed for the submarine after nightfall on 18 August. Thinking all surviving marines were on board, &quot;Nautilus&quot; and &quot;Argonaut&quot; set course for Pearl Harbor, arriving 25 August.

==3rd–5th patrols, September 1942 – April 1943==
On her third war patrol, from 15 September to 5 November, &quot;Nautilus&quot; returned to Japanese waters to join the submarine blockade chain stretched from the Kurile Islands to the Nansei Shoto. Despite heavy seas, which precluded periscope use and torpedo firing during much of the patrol, and mechanical breakdowns, which impeded approaches to targets, she torpedoed and sank three &quot;maru&quot;s (Japanese merchant ships) and, in surface action, destroyed three sampans to add over 12,000 tons to her score. On 12 October, however, the patrol became one of her more perilous, as she took a heavy depth charging. Two days later, her crew noticed a slight oil slick in her wake. The hindering seas now protected by breaking up the trace. By 19 October, the leak had enlarged considerably and on 20 October, the first relatively calm day since the depth charging, air leaks were discovered. &quot;Nautilus&quot; was leaving a trail for Japanese defense patrols. Moving to a quieter area, with less aerial activity, she continued her patrol until 24 October when she sank &quot;Kenun Maru&quot;, then headed for home without sighting enemy planes. She reached Midway Island 31 October, performed temporary repairs, and continued on to Pearl Harbor.

During her fourth patrol, conducted in the Solomon Islands from on 13 December 1942 to on 4 February 1943, &quot;Nautilus&quot; rescued 26 adults and three children from Teop Harbor on 31 December and 1 January, then added the cargo ship &quot;Yosinogawa Maru&quot; to her kills and damaged a tanker, a freighter, and a destroyer. On 4 February, she arrived at Brisbane, debarked her passengers, and sailed for Pearl Harbor. Arriving 15 April, she departed five days later heading north. On 27 April, she put into Dutch Harbor, Alaska, and commenced instructing the 7th Infantry Division Provisional Scout Battalion in amphibious landings. She then embarked 109 Scouts (including Alaskan Native scouts of the Alaska Territorial Guard) and on 1 May, headed for Attu. There, on 11 May, she landed her &quot;passengers&quot; five hours before the main assault.

==6th–8th patrols, September 1943 – April 1944==
Overhaul at Mare Island occupied most of the summer and on 16 September &quot;Nautilus&quot; left Pearl Harbor to spend her sixth war patrol conducting photo-reconnaissance of the Gilbert Islands, concentrating on Tarawa, Kuma, Butaritari, Abemama, and Makin, all of which had been reinforced, particularly Tarawa, since the sub&#x27;s 1942 excursion into those waters. The information, including continuous panoramic pictures of the coastlines and chart corrections, which she brought back to Pearl Harbor on 17 October, proved among the most useful intelligence gathered of the area prior to the invasion of Tarawa.

She returned to Tarawa 18 November to obtain last-minute information on weather and surf conditions, landing hazards and the results of recent bombardments. At 21:59 on 19 November, mistaking her for a Japanese submarine, the destroyer fired at her while she was off Maiana in the Gilbert Islands at , hitting her at the base of her conning tower with a five-inch (127 mm) shell which did not explode but damaged the main induction valve. Diving as soon as the water depth permitted, &quot;Nautilus&quot; was rigged for depth charging and the damage control party went to work. &quot;Nautilus&quot; avoided further damage and suffered no casualties, but reached a depth of before her crew gained control of her. Within two hours repairs were sufficient to allow &quot;Nautilus&quot; to continue with her primary mission: landing a 78-man scouting party, composed of 5th Amphibious Reconnaissance Company Marines and an Australian scout, on Abemama.

At midnight 20–21 November, &quot;Nautilus&quot; lay off an island in the Abemama Atoll, Kenna to discharge her passengers. By 15:00, all were safely ashore. On the afternoon of 22 November, &quot;Nautilus&quot; provided fire support to bring the tiny (25-man) enemy garrison out of their bunkers. This proved accurate, killing 14; the remainder committed suicide. By the time the main assault force arrived on 26 November, Abemama had been secured and preparations to turn it into an air base for the Marshall Islands campaign had begun.

 For actions during this mission, Commander William D. Irvin, Nautilus Commanding Officer, was awarded the Navy Cross.

&quot;Nautilus&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 4 December to prepare for her eighth war patrol. Conducted north of Palau and west of the Mariana Islands from 27 January. On 21 March 1944 she sank the ex-hospital ship &quot;America Maru&quot; (she had been reverted to a transport December 1943) and damaged three cargo ships. On 26 April, &quot;Nautilus&quot; sailed for Brisbane, whence she departed 29 May to begin a series of special missions in support of guerrilla and reconnaissance activities in the Philippines.

==9th–14th patrols, May 1944 – January 1945==
On her ninth patrol, from 29 May to 11 June, she carried ammunition, oil, and dry stores to Philippine guerrillas under Colonel R.V. Bowler on Mindanao. Between 12 June and 27 June, she transported a similar cargo to Negros Island and embarked evacuees, including one German POW, for Darwin. During her 11th patrol, from 30 June to 27 July, she landed a reconnaissance party and 12 tons of stores on North Pandan Island, and more supplies to Colonel Kangleon on Leyte and Colonel Abcede on Mindanao. On her 12th, 13th and 14th patrols, she returned to the central Philippines, landed personnel and supplies at various points on Mindanao and Luzon, and carried evacuees to Australia. On 25 September, during the first of these three patrols, she grounded on Iuisan Shoal. Forced to lighten her load, her evacuees, mail, captured documents, and cargo were sent ashore. All secret materials were burned. Her reserve fuel tanks were blown dry, variable ballast was blown overboard and six-inch (152 mm) ammunition jettisoned. With the blowing of her main ballast tanks she was finally able to get off the reef within three and a half hours, despite the receding tide, and clear the area by dawn.

During her 13th patrol, on 31 October 1944, &quot;Nautilus&quot; finished off , which had run aground on a reef and could not be recovered. Numerous attempts to torpedo the wreck had failed as torpedoes detonated on the reef. &quot;Nautilus&quot;″s six-inch (152 mm) guns, however, scored 55 hits, and her report states, &quot;It is doubtful that any equipment in &quot;Darter&quot; at 11:30 this date would be of any value to Japan – except as scrap.&quot;

&quot;Nautilus&quot; completed her 14th, and last, patrol at Darwin on 30 January 1945. From Australia, she was routed on to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where she arrived 25 May for inactivation. Decommissioned with a bottle of champagne over the forward 6 inch (152 mm) gun on 30 June, she was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register 25 July and sold 16 November, to the North American Smelting Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for scrapping.

==In popular culture==
Season 2, Episode 26 of the American television series &quot;The Silent Service&quot;, first broadcast in 1958, dramatizes the Teop Harbor rescue of 24 December 1942.

<doc id="421916" wikidata="Q4694027" url="?curid=421916" title="Agriculture in Communist Czechoslovakia">
<text>Huge changes in agricultural practice were instituted under the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic (a socialist republic which lasted from the communist revolution of 1948 until the Velvet Revolution of 1989). 95% of all privately owned companies were nationalized, and 95% of farms were nationalized. No one could own more than 50 hectares of land. Collectivization worked for some but not others. Larger farms were organized on 3 levels of hierarchy which actually reduced worker participation in decision making. A massive trend during the early part of the collectivization period was that younger workers left for better jobs in the cities and productivity fell. Reforms in the 1970s saw more investment and improvements began to appear gradually. There were record harvests in the 1980s.

==Mid-1980s characteristics==

=== Basic facts===
*The total land area of post-war Czechoslovakia was nearly 128,000 km², of which almost 68,000 km² was considered agricultural land. The remaining land was classified as non-agricultural, and included 45,000 km² of forests.
*In the mid-1980s, agricultural activity was spread throughout the country.
*Urbanization and industrialization had slowly but steadily reduced the amount of agricultural land; it declined by over 6,000 km² between 1948 and the late 1970s.
*In 1984, irrigation facilities existed for over 3,220 km², a little over 6% of the arable land.
*As of 1980 the country had 13,000 km² of drained area, constituting about 18% of all agricultural land.

=== Socialist sector ===
In 1985, some 95% of the country&#x27;s agricultural land was in the socialist sector, either via agricultural cooperatives or state-owned farms.

In 1989, two-thirds of agricultural lands were managed by (; ) or farmers&#x27; collectives. Collective farms had increased in area by 6.5 times since 1950. In 1985 there were 1,677 collectives with 997,798 members. 

The remaining one-third of agricultural lands were owned by the government and managed by the (; ), a state enterprise. Areas managed included 226 state estates engaged in farming and animal husbandry, and lands of the Central Academies of the Czechoslovak State Estates. The ČSSS employed 166,432 workers in 1985. 

Collective farms held about 43,000 km2 (plus about 870 km2 in private plots), and state farms held 21,000 km2. Members of collective farms were permitted to cultivate personal plots of 5,000 m2 or less and to maintain some livestock. Such personal plots reached a peak of popularity in the early 1960s, when they accounted for 3,550 km2. By 1975 their area had decreased to 1,710 km2. Production from personal plots was minor and served primarily as a food source for the cultivator.

=== Private farmers ===
Private farmers owned only 4,040 km2, consisting mainly of small farms in the hill country of Slovakia. By 1980 there were only 150,000 such small farms operating. In 1982, however, the government introduced measures to encourage private small-scale animal breeding and fruit and vegetable cultivation. Planning authorities did not expect this activity would be the main source of income for small farmers, and they limited the land used for this purpose primarily to that reclaimed from currently unused, somewhat marginal agricultural land, estimated at 1,000 km2 in 1984. The government hoped that a large proportion of demand for fruit and green vegetables, as well as for meat, would be satisfied in this way. In 1984, according to official reports, small-scale private producers accounted for about 10% of meat production, 38% of vegetable production, and 64% of fruit production. A secondary purpose of the government measures, land reclamation, was a matter of considerable urgency because of the decline in agricultural land that took place in the 1970s and early 1980s.

== Cooperation between farms ==
Government policy encouraged cooperation and specialization among the various agricultural units. Both informal and formal arrangements existed. Mutual aid in terms of machinery or labor for particular tasks had long been practiced among neighboring farms, and this continued under the collectivized farming system. More formal arrangements took shape in the 1960s and expanded in the 1970s. Many of these took the form of &quot;joint agricultural enterprises,&quot; entities that somewhat resembled stock companies. Some cooperative organizations specialized in such activities as fattening of hogs or cattle, production of eggs or drying and production of feed mixtures. Others offered agrichemical, construction, land improvement, or marketing services. A large number of these organizations engaged in multiple activities.

==Farm management==
Management of most large farms was organized hierarchically on three levels. On large cooperative farms, an assembly of members or their elected representatives was legally responsible for farm operation, although a committee and its chairman carried out daily management of operation. In practice, the assembly functioned largely to ratify decisions already made by the chairman. As cooperative farms increased in size, the authority of the assembly of members declined. Boards of economic management, consisting of the chairman and a staff of experts on various operations, took over the most important management functions. The second echelon of management in large cooperatives or state farms had responsibility for smaller operations in either a specific area or a particular branch of production. The third level of management organized the labor force performing the farm work, such as the field brigades. The chairman of a cooperative or the director of a state farm held most of the power in the organization, and the subordinate levels were severely restricted in their decision making.

==History==

Even before World War II, industrialization in Czechoslovakia had substantially reduced the relative importance of agriculture in the economy. Before the KSČ gained control of the government, Czechoslovak agriculture consisted primarily of small to mid-size family farms with an efficiency on a par with most of Europe. The situation did not change until 1949, when the KSČ initiated a policy of collectivization. The pace of collectivization was gradual until the late 1950s and was generally more thorough in the Czech lands than in Slovakia. Collectivization was essentially completed by 1960. Large numbers of farmers, particularly the young, left agriculture for more attractive industrial jobs. In the 1960s, the active farm population consisted largely of women and older men.

Under communist rule, agriculture received much less attention and investment funding than industry. Partly because of this fact, agricultural output grew slowly, not regaining prewar levels of production until the 1960s. Falling productivity and the need to increase farm output to reduce agricultural imports eventually drew official attention to agriculture. A principal government goal was to encourage large-scale farming that could benefit from modern technologies and powerful farm equipment. Proceeding slowly during the 1980s, consolidation of farms accelerated in the 1970s. Most of the larger cooperatives encompassed several villages and raised a variety of crops and livestock. In the 1960s, in an effort to increase farm incomes, the government raised the prices of farm products; during the previous decade, by contrast, prices for farm produce had been kept low, partly to extract workers and investment funds for the expansion of industry. By the early 1970s, the average farm income reportedly had reached parity with that of urban white- collar workers. The farm labor force of the 1980s was relatively young (45% was under 40 years of age in 1980) and well educated. The performance of the agricultural sector improved markedly during the 1970s and the first half of the 1980s. In 1960 the official index of gross agricultural output (in constant 1980 prices) had stood at 96, compared with 100 in 1936. In 1970 the index reached 116.8, and by 1980 it had increased to 143. Between 1981 and 1985, according to official sources, total agricultural production increased by 9.8% over the 1980 level.

Crop cultivation slowly became less important in the gross output of the agricultural sector. Cropping and livestock were almost equal branches in 1960, but by 1985 crops accounted for only 43% of gross agricultural output compared with 57% for livestock products. The main crop products in the 1980s were wheat, barley, potatoes, sugar beets, rye, and hops (an important export crop). Sugar, derived from sugar beet production, was both a significant export crop (especially to hard currency areas) and an important item of domestic consumption. Fruit and vegetables accounted for only a small part of the cultivated area. Since the 1950s, the supply of livestock gradually increased because of government encouragement. Producers were urged to meet the demand for meat that accompanied the rise in income levels of the population. After the collectivization of agriculture, raising livestock increasingly became a large-scale operation, usually undertaken in conjunction with cropping. The major constraint to livestock expansion was a shortage of fodder and feed mixtures, although government pricing policies and the labor demands of animal husbandry also tended to deter efforts. During the 1970s, progress was made in expanding the supplies of fodder and feed mixtures and the country&#x27;s processing capacity. However, it remained necessary to supplement the supply of feed and fodder through imports, which became increasingly burdensome because they came from non-communist countries and thus required payment in convertible currencies.

The basic aim of agricultural policy in the mid-1980s, with regard to both crop and livestock production, was self-sufficiency. Record harvests in 1984 and 1985 made it possible to virtually halt grain imports, which had amounted to about 500,000 tons per year. During the Seventh Five-Year Plan, the government was able to reduce imports of feed grains to one-third the level of the previous five-year plan without causing a reduction in per capita meat consumption, an achievement suggesting that the efficiency of animal husbandry had improved. Performance in the agricultural sector as a whole remained uneven in the 1980s, however. Although some outstanding farms were obtaining excellent grain yields, the uneven quality of farm management contributed to large discrepancies in performance between farms.

<text>Foreign trade played an important role in the national economy of Communist Czechoslovakia as opposed to the economic system of the Soviet Union.

== History and timeline ==
=== 1948–1953 ===

After the 1948 coup d&#x27;état, foreign trade enterprises successfully carried out the government&#x27;s policy of rapidly redirecting the bulk of the country&#x27;s foreign trade to communist states in the period from 1948 to 1953.

Many observers contended, however, that the new system had seriously adverse effects on the economy. Isolating domestic producers of export products—primarily manufactured goods—from developments abroad slowed the introduction of new technology, the upgrading of the appearance of products, and the development of sales and service staffs with adequate parts inventories. Isolation hampered the development of export industries and products, reinforcing the autarkic bias of the Soviet model.

=== 1953–1960 ===

After Joseph Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953, Czechoslovak trade with the Western world gradually revived, although it still was far below prewar levels. More than two-thirds of the foreign trade continued to be with Comecon member states. Because of its relatively advanced industrial position within Comecon, Czechoslovakia initially had a secure market for its machinery and equipment exports. As years passed, however, the Soviet Union absorbed growing portions of Czechoslovakia&#x27;s export capacity and very soon the country came to depend on the Soviet Union for imports of raw materials as well.

=== 1960–1980 ===

By the 1960s, it became clear that the country&#x27;s dependence on foreign trade was substantial and that a restructuring of the economy was necessary.
In the 1970s, the government authorized a number of large enterprises to deal directly, or through affiliations with Czechoslovak foreign trade companies, with foreign purchasers of their products. To encourage further export and modernization, the central authorities permitted Czechoslovak firms to retain a regulated portion of export proceeds. Authorities also acknowledged that the economy seriously lagged behind the non-communist industrialized countries in application of new technologies. In response, they increased imports of Western products and processes that incorporated advanced technology.

In the mid-1970s, the terms of trade for Czechoslovakia began to deteriorate rapidly. In 1975 the pricing system used to set values on imports and exports in trade between communist countries was adjusted to make them more current and closer to world prices. The adjustment raised the price of fuels and raw materials (primarily Czechoslovak imports) much more than it did manufactured goods (the country&#x27;s main export). The same trend manifested itself in trade with Western industrialized countries.

During the late 1970s, the terms of trade continued to worsen; greater and greater quantities of exports were required to purchase the same volume of imports. The combination of worsening terms of trade and the difficulty of expanding exports caused Czechoslovakia&#x27;s trade imbalance to grow in almost every area. Between 1975 and 1979, the country&#x27;s excess of imports over exports was nearly US$1.2 billion with the Soviet Union, US$690 million with Eastern Europe, and US$3.3 billion with noncommunist developed countries. These imbalances emerged despite efforts to conserve fuel and raw material use, to slow the volume of other imports, and to increase exports.

During the 1970s, Czechoslovakia, like other countries of Eastern Europe, turned to West European credit sources to obtain financial help for imports as well as longer-term investments in modern technology.

Czechoslovakia did not publish information on these credits. However, one Western estimate placed Czechoslovakia&#x27;s hard currency debt to the West at the end of 1979 at US$4 billion gross and about US$3.1 billion net. Czechoslovak officials had been much more prudent in building up a foreign currency debt than had several other East European nations, however, and the country&#x27;s credit standing remained good.

=== 1980–1991 ===

Beginning in 1980, Czechoslovakia was able to achieve a trade surplus with non-communist countries, but only by drastically curtailing imports. When Western banks tightened credit to Eastern Europe in 1982 (largely in reaction to Polish insolvency), Czechoslovakia redoubled its efforts to curb imports and pay off its debt. This cautious attitude continued to prevail even after the creditors&#x27; policy eased. The government&#x27;s stance did have the disadvantage of depriving Czechoslovakia of potentially helpful Western technology.

However, at the end of 1984, Czechoslovakia could boast one of the lowest net hard currency debts per capita (about US$15 per inhabitant) in Eastern Europe; only Bulgaria&#x27;s debt was lower. With the Soviet Union, by contrast, Czechoslovakia continued to run a substantial deficit.

In the mid-1980s, according to official statistics, Czechoslovak trade activities remained overwhelmingly oriented toward intra-Comecon trade. Within Comecon, in keeping with the plan for regional specialization set forth in the Comprehensive Program of 1971, Czechoslovakia concentrated on production of machine tools and electric railroad locomotives; the traditionally strong Czechoslovak armaments industry also remained important. In 1985, almost 78% of total Czechoslovak foreign trade turnover was with Comecon members. Trade with &quot;developed capitalist countries&quot;, by contrast, was listed at just under 16% and developing countries accounted for over 6%.

Most Western analysts believed that official Czechoslovak methods of calculation tended to overstate considerably the value of trade conducted in transferable rubles, i.e., with Comecon partners, and to underestimate the value of hard currency trade with non-communist countries. Nevertheless, the general structure of Czechoslovakia&#x27;s foreign trade was unmistakable.

==Organization==
Under the Czechoslovak system, foreign trade was a state monopoly, supervised by the central Ministry of Foreign Trade. The ministry oversaw the operation of about thirty foreign trade enterprises. As intermediaries between the domestic export producers or import purchasers and the external market, the enterprises were responsible for arranging contracts as well as for financing and generally supervising Czechoslovak foreign trade, usually setting prices that have little connection with domestic production factors.

The foreign trade companies bought Czechoslovak goods for export at domestic prices and sold foreign goods to Czechoslovak customers at domestic prices; but the other half of these transactions, involving actual foreign trade, took place in foreign currencies in foreign markets. The government budget then made adjustments to compensate for any unwanted gains and losses caused by varying foreign and domestic prices.

===Foreign exchange and exchange rate===
An important characteristic of the Soviet model that was imposed on Czechoslovakia in 1948 was the attempt to insulate the domestic economy and minimize the impact of world economic trends. The system accomplished this in part by severely restricting foreign currency transactions and confining them to official channels at fixed and favorable exchange rates. Within a few years, the exchange rate had lost its historical basis and no longer bore any direct relationship to purchasing power in other currencies.

===Trade partners===
==== Major partners ====
Czechoslovak trade was heavily concentrated among a relatively small group of countries. According to official statistics, five countries accounted for 71.7% of all foreign trade in 1985:
# (East Germany)
#
# (West Germany)

The Soviet Union exerted a powerful influence over the Czechoslovak economy. In 1985 it accounted for 44.8% of foreign trade turnover, according to official statistics.

In 1985 by far the most important export from Czechoslovakia to the Soviet Union was machinery and various kinds of equipment, such as machine tools, power generating equipment, instruments and laboratory equipment, agricultural machinery, railroad rolling stock and other transport equipment, and equipment for the food, textile, and chemical industries. Such items made up over 60% of exports to the Soviet Union.

Other minor items were ores and metals, clothing and footwear, chemicals, furniture, domestic appliances, and beverages. Czechoslovak imports from the Soviet Union, by contrast, consisted primarily of raw materials and energy-related items; petroleum and petroleum products accounted for almost 43% of import value, and natural gas and electricity totaled 18%. Other imported products were machinery and transport equipment, representing almost 10% of total imports; metal ores, coal and coke, and pig iron and ferroalloys made up almost 8%. Second, third, and fourth in order of rank in Czechoslovak foreign trade turnover were East Germany, Poland, and Hungary.

Among noncommunist countries, an important trade partner was West Germany (fifth in rank). Principal Czechoslovak exports to West Germany in 1985 were various manufactured goods (especially paper and paperboard, textiles, and iron and steel products), mineral fuel products (briquettes, coke, and refined petroleum products), and chemical products. Principal imports from West Germany were machinery (textile- and leather-working machinery, machine tools, and electrical machinery and instruments), chemical products, and various manufactured goods.

==== Other partners ====

Other East European Comecon countries, such as Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary, were also of considerable importance (seventh and ninth in rank, respectively). Czechoslovak exports to these countries in 1985, according to official data, consisted mainly of machinery and transport equipment, chemical products, and (especially to Hungary) coal and briquettes. Imports likewise were primarily machinery and transport equipment, chemical products, and various other manufactured goods. Czechoslovakia also imported food and animal products from Hungary.

Other significant trading partners were Austria, Britain, Italy, and France. Engineering products, which accounted for more than 50% of all Czechoslovak exports, had a share of only 10 to 11% in noncommunist trade, owing to very strong and successful West European competition. Instead, consumer goods, metallurgical products, chemicals, and fuels and raw materials were more important. With regard to imports from noncommunist countries, Czechoslovakia in 1986 was especially interested in the high technology offered by Western Europe and Japan (twenty-fifth in rank). Particularly in demand were products from engineering, electronics, and electrical engineering industries, as well as biotechnology and pharmaceuticals. As of 1985, Czechoslovakia also conducted substantial amounts of trade with Yugoslavia, the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Syria, and Cuba.

Czechoslovak trade with the United States (twenty-third in rank) was modest. In 1985 Czechoslovak exports to the United States included, among other things, footwear and jewelry, glassware, steel bars, wire, shaped steel, prepared or preserved meats, and hops. In 1985 imports consisted, among other things, of raw materials (hides and skins, seeds for producing vegetable oil, and ores and concentrates of base metals), specialized industrial machinery, and printed materials.

During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Czechoslovakia had imported substantial amounts of grain from the United States, but more abundant domestic harvests enabled the country to reduce these imports in the mid-1980s.

<text>Antonio Lotti (5 January 1667 – 5 January 1740) was an Italian composer of the Baroque era.

==Biography==

Lotti was born in Venice, although his father Matteo was &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; at Hanover at the time. Oral tradition says that in 1682, Lotti began studying with Lodovico Fuga and Giovanni Legrenzi, both of whom were employed at St Mark&#x27;s Basilica, Venice&#x27;s principal church, although there is no documentary evidence.

===Venice===
Lotti made his career at St Mark&#x27;s, first as an alto singer (from 1689), then as assistant to the second organist, then as second organist (from 1692), then (from 1704) as first organist, and finally (from 1736) as &quot;maestro di cappella&quot;, a position he held until his death.

Because of the paucity of solid scholarship until recent decades, older reference books cite a good deal of misinformation regarding Lotti&#x27;s biography. Cicogna&#x27;s 1834 Delle inscrizioni Veneziane and Francesco Caffi’s 1854 &quot;Storia della Musica&quot; relied on oral tradition more than a century old to name works that Lotti supposedly composed for the Ospedale degl’ Incurabili.

Later studies built upon that assertion to name Lotti as one of the supposed maestri of the Incurabili. The 2001 New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians went a step further to try to extrapolate when Lotti&#x27;s period of employment at the Incurabili would supposedly have been, building on a house of cards.

However, recent studies establish that there is no documentary evidence whatsoever of any such employment ever taking place. The most current and most comprehensive studies by Caroline Giron-Panel and Pier Gillio establish conclusively that Lotti was not formally employed by the Incurabili, and that there is no evidence of his having composed any music for that institution, even on informal terms.

According to one nineteenth-century biographer, Lotti was a notable teacher, with Domenico Alberti, Benedetto Marcello, Giovanni Battista Pescetti, Baldassare Galuppi, Giuseppe Saratelli and Jan Dismas Zelenka among those believed to have been his pupils, although evidence is lacking in some cases. He was married to the noted soprano Santa Stella.

What is indeed well-documented is Lotti&#x27;s employment at various other Venetian institutions, including the Scuola dello Spirito Santo, one of the scuole piccole. The governing body of the scuola, the Provveditori di Comun, contracted Antonio Lotti in 1695 to provide music at the scuola for the annual feast of Pentecost and the two days after for total of at least eight years. More significantly, he redistributed the balance between singers and instrumentalists in a way that reflects a change of musical texture and style in the sacred music performed there.

In 1717 he was given leave to go to Dresden.

===Dresden===
There is one more venue for which Lotti is known to have composed sacred music, namely, the Dresden court of Friedrich Augustus I, Elector of Saxony) where Lotti was in residence from 1717 to 1719. While in Venice, the king had engaged Lotti specifically to compose for the Italian opera troupe that he had assembled. But the Electorate seems to have gone to lengths to keep the visiting Italians away from the resident chapel musicians, particularly from Kapellmeister Johann Christoph Schmidt.

“The king also authorized some appointments only under the condition “that this not disturb anything among the orchestra.” The electoral prince was even forced, when the Italians were already in Dresden, to declare outright in a letter to the Count [Christian Heinrich von Watzdorf, minister of domestic affairs] that he would take [the Italians] into his special protection and protect them against any ill will... “about which, the King has declared that His Majesty will afford them every possible protection, whatever it takes, that [Court Chapel master Johann Christoph Schmidt] should have no business with them.”

In Dresden he also composed operas, including &quot;Giove in Argo&quot;, &quot;Teofane&quot; and &quot;Li quattro elementi&quot; (all with librettos by Antonio Maria Lucchini). Other works written in Venice include &quot;Giustino&quot;; &quot;Trionfo dell&#x27;Innocenza&quot;; the first act of &quot;Tirsi&quot;, &quot;Achille Placato&quot;, &quot;Teuzzone&quot;, &quot;Ama più che non si crede&quot;, &quot;Il comando inteso e tradito&quot;, &quot;Sidonio&quot;, &quot;Isaccio tiranno&quot;, &quot;La forze de sangue&quot;, &quot;Il Tradimento traditore di sé stesso&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Infedeltà punita&quot;, &quot;Poresenna&quot;, &quot;Irene Augusta&quot;, &quot;Polidoro&quot;, &quot;Foca superbo&quot;, &quot;Alessandro Severo&quot;, &quot;Il Vincitore Generossi&quot; and &quot;Odii del Sangue delusi&quot;.

===Return to Venice===
He returned to his job at San Marco in Venice in 1719 and remained there until his death in 1740.

==Compositions==
Lotti wrote in a variety of forms, producing masses, cantatas, madrigals, around thirty operas, and instrumental music. Some of his sacred choral works are unaccompanied (&quot;a cappella&quot;) but many of them are composed in the &quot;concertato&quot; style with strings, basso continuo, and occasionally oboes and trumpets. His more progressive works foreshadow the galant style, considered a transition between the established Baroque and emerging Classical styles.

Johann Sebastian Bach, George Frideric Handel, and Jan Dismas Zelenka all had copies of Lotti&#x27;s &quot;Missa Sapientiae&quot;, a Kyrie–Gloria Mass (Kyrie in G minor, Gloria in G major).

No longer attributed to Lotti:
* The Magnificat in C major, BWV Anh. 30 used to be attributed to Lotti, but appears to have been composed by Pietro Torri.
* The Kyrie–Gloria Mass for double choir, BWV Anh. 167, for which Lotti was suggested as composer in the second half of the 19th century, an attribution that was thought possible until the late 20th century, has more recently been attributed to other composers.

<text>Duke of Ireland is a title that was created in 1386 for Robert de Vere, 9th Earl of Oxford (1362–1392), the favourite of King Richard II of England, who had previously been created Marquess of Dublin. Both were peerages for one life only. At this time, only the Pale of Ireland (the Lordship of Ireland) was under English control. Despite its name, the Dukedom of Ireland is generally considered to have been one in the Peerage of England, and is the first time that a Ducal title was created for someone who was not a close relative of the King.

The arms with three crowns that were granted to Duke Robert as an augmentation to his arms in 1386 continued to be used for nearly a century as the arms of the Lordship of Ireland.

The Duke fell from favour shortly after receiving the title, resulted in forfeiture of the first creation in 1388.

It merged in the crown on Henry&#x27;s usurpation two years later, and has never since been recreated.

The title takes its name from Hereford, Herefordshire, England. The city lies near the border with Wales, and has more often been in the title of the Earl of Hereford or the Viscount Hereford.

<text>In many areas of science, Bragg&#x27;s law, [[Georg Wulff|Wulff]]–Bragg&#x27;s condition, or Laue–Bragg interference are a special case of Laue diffraction, giving the angles for coherent scattering of waves from a large crystal lattice. It describes how the superposition of wave fronts scattered by lattice planes leads to a strict relation between the wavelength and scattering angle. This law was initially formulated for X-rays, but it also applies to all types of matter waves including neutron and electron waves if there are a large number of atoms, as well as visible light with artificial periodic microscale lattices.

== History ==

Bragg diffraction (also referred to as the Bragg formulation of X-ray diffraction) was first proposed by Lawrence Bragg and his father, William Henry Bragg, in 1913 after their discovery that crystalline solids produced surprising patterns of reflected X-rays (in contrast to those produced with, for instance, a liquid). They found that these crystals, at certain specific wavelengths and incident angles, produced intense peaks of reflected radiation. 

Lawrence Bragg explained this result by modeling the crystal as a set of discrete parallel planes separated by a constant parameter . He proposed that the incident X-ray radiation would produce a Bragg peak if reflections off the various planes interfered constructively. The interference is constructive when the phase difference between the wave reflected off different atomic planes is a multiple of ; this condition (see &quot;Bragg condition&quot; section below) was first presented by Lawrence Bragg on 11 November 1912 to the Cambridge Philosophical Society. Although simple, Bragg&#x27;s law confirmed the existence of real particles at the atomic scale, as well as providing a powerful new tool for studying crystals. Lawrence Bragg and his father, William Henry Bragg, were awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1915 for their work in determining crystal structures beginning with NaCl, ZnS, and diamond. They are the only father-son team to jointly win.

The concept of Bragg diffraction applies equally to neutron diffraction and approximately to electron diffraction. In both cases the wavelengths are comparable with inter-atomic distances (~ 150 pm). Many other types of matter waves have also been shown to diffract, and also light from objects with a larger ordered structure such as opals.

== Bragg condition ==

Bragg diffraction occurs when radiation of a wavelength comparable to atomic spacings is scattered in a specular fashion (mirror-like reflection) by planes of atoms in a crystalline material, and undergoes constructive interference. When the scattered waves are incident at a specific angle, they remain in phase and constructively interfere. The glancing angle (see figure on the right, and note that this differs from the convention in Snell&#x27;s law where is measured from the surface normal), the wavelength , and the &quot;grating constant&quot; of the crystal are connected by the relation:formula_1where formula_2 is the diffraction order (formula_3 is first order, formula_4 is second order, formula_5 is third order). This equation, Bragg&#x27;s law, describes the condition on &quot;θ&quot; for constructive interference.

A map of the intensities of the scattered waves as a function of their angle is called a diffraction pattern. Strong intensities known as Bragg peaks are obtained in the diffraction pattern when the scattering angles satisfy Bragg condition. This is a special case of the more general Laue equations, and the Laue equations can be shown to reduce to the Bragg condition with additional assumptions.

== Derivation ==
In Bragg&#x27;s original paper he describes his approach as a Huygens&#x27; construction for a reflected wave.
Suppose that a plane wave (of any type) is incident on planes of lattice points, with separation formula_6, at an angle formula_7 as shown in the Figure. Points A and C are on one plane, and B is on the plane below. Points ABCC&#x27; form a quadrilateral.
There will be a path difference between the ray that gets reflected along AC&#x27; and the ray that gets transmitted along AB, then reflected along BC. This path difference is
formula_8

The two separate waves will arrive at a point (infinitely far from these lattice planes) with the same phase, and hence undergo constructive interference, if and only if this path difference is equal to any integer value of the wavelength, i.e.
formula_9

where formula_10 and formula_11 are an integer and the wavelength of the incident wave respectively.

Therefore, from the geometry
formula_12

from which it follows that
formula_13

Putting everything together,
formula_14

which simplifies to formula_15 which is Bragg&#x27;s law shown above.

If only two planes of atoms were diffracting, as shown in the Figure then the transition from constructive to destructive interference would be gradual as a function of angle, with gentle maxima at the Bragg angles. However, since many atomic planes are participating in most real materials, sharp peaks are typical.

A rigorous derivation from the more general Laue equations is available (see page: Laue equations).

== Beyond Bragg&#x27;s law ==

The Bragg condition is correct for very large crystals. Because the scattering of X-rays and neutrons is relatively weak, in many cases quite large crystals with sizes of 100 nm or more are used. While there can be additional effects due to crystal defects, these are often quite small. In contrast, electrons interact thousands of times more strongly with solids than X-rays, and also lose energy (inelastic scattering). Therefore samples used in transmission electron diffraction are much thinner. Typical diffraction patterns, for instance the Figure, show spots for different directions (plane waves) of the electrons leaving a crystal. The angles that Bragg&#x27;s law predicts are still approximately right, but in general there is a lattice of spots which are close to projections of the reciprocal lattice that is at right angles to the direction of the electron beam. (In contrast, Bragg&#x27;s law predicts that only one or perhaps two would be present, not simultaneously tens to hundreds.) With low-energy electron diffraction where the electron energies are typically 30-1000 electron volts, the result is similar with the electrons reflected back from a surface. Also similar is reflection high-energy electron diffraction which typically leads to rings of diffraction spots.

With X-rays the effect of having small crystals is described by the Scherrer equation. This leads to broadening of the Bragg peaks which can be used to estimate the size of the crystals.

== Bragg scattering of visible light by colloids ==
A colloidal crystal is a highly ordered array of particles that forms over a long range (from a few millimeters to one centimeter in length); colloidal crystals have appearance and properties roughly analogous to their atomic or molecular counterparts. It has been known for many years that, due to repulsive Coulombic interactions, electrically charged macromolecules in an aqueous environment can exhibit long-range crystal-like correlations, with interparticle separation distances often being considerably greater than the individual particle diameter. Periodic arrays of spherical particles give rise to interstitial voids (the spaces between the particles), which act as a natural diffraction grating for visible light waves, when the interstitial spacing is of the same order of magnitude as the incident lightwave. In these cases brilliant iridescence (or play of colours) is attributed to the diffraction and constructive interference of visible lightwaves according to Bragg&#x27;s law, in a matter analogous to the scattering of X-rays in crystalline solid. The effects occur at visible wavelengths because the interplanar spacing is much larger than for true crystals. Precious opal is one example of a colloidal crystal with optical effects.

== Volume Bragg gratings ==

Volume Bragg gratings (VBG) or volume holographic gratings (VHG) consist of a volume where there is a periodic change in the refractive index. Depending on the orientation of the refractive index modulation, VBG can be used either to transmit or reflect a small bandwidth of wavelengths. Bragg&#x27;s law (adapted for volume hologram) dictates which wavelength will be diffracted:

formula_16

where is the Bragg order (a positive integer), the diffracted wavelength, Λ the fringe spacing of the grating, the angle between the incident beam and the normal () of the entrance surface and the angle between the normal and the grating vector (). Radiation that does not match Bragg&#x27;s law will pass through the VBG undiffracted. The output wavelength can be tuned over a few hundred nanometers by changing the incident angle (). VBG are being used to produce widely tunable laser source or perform global hyperspectral imagery (see Photon etc.).

== Selection rules and practical crystallography ==

The measurement of the angles can be used to determine crystal structure, see x-ray crystallography for more details. As a simple example, Bragg&#x27;s law, as stated above, can be used to obtain the lattice spacing of a particular cubic system through the following relation:

formula_17

where formula_18 is the lattice spacing of the cubic crystal, and , , and are the Miller indices of the Bragg plane. Combining this relation with Bragg&#x27;s law gives:

formula_19

One can derive selection rules for the Miller indices for different cubic Bravais lattices as well as many others, a few of the selection rules are given in the table below.


These selection rules can be used for any crystal with the given crystal structure. KCl has a face-centered cubic Bravais lattice. However, the K+ and the Cl− ion have the same number of electrons and are quite close in size, so that the diffraction pattern becomes essentially the same as for a simple cubic structure with half the lattice parameter. Selection rules for other structures can be referenced elsewhere, or derived. Lattice spacing for the other crystal systems can be found here.

<text>USS &quot;Turbot&quot; (SS-427), a , was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the turbot, a large, brown and white flatfish, valued as a food.

&quot;Turbot&quot;″s keel was laid down on 13 November 1943 at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, by the Cramp Shipbuilding Company, but the contract for her construction was cancelled on 12 August 1945. Her partially completed hulk was launched on 12 April 1946 and, in 1950, was assigned to the Naval Ship Research and Development Center at Annapolis, Maryland, where it was used for research and development in connection with the control and reduction of machinery noise in submarines.

&quot;Turbot&quot; was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register in 1958, and sold for scrapping to the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, at Sparrow&#x27;s Point, Maryland; however, rather than being scrapped, she remained tied up to a U.S. Navy pier in Carr&#x27;s Creek at the North Severn Naval Station in Maryland, where she continued to be used for testing well into the 1980s. Some material was removed from her hulk for use in other submarines, including her six torpedo air flasks, which were installed in the submarine in San Francisco, California.

<text>Liberty Island is a federally owned island in Upper New York Bay in the northeastern United States. Its most notable feature is the Statue of Liberty (&quot;Liberty Enlightening the World&quot;), a large statue by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi that was dedicated in 1886. The island also contains the Statue of Liberty Museum, which opened in 2019 and exhibits the statue&#x27;s original torch.

Long known as Bedloe&#x27;s Island, it was renamed by an act of the United States Congress in 1956. Part of the State of New York, the island is an exclave of the New York City borough of Manhattan, surrounded by the waters of Jersey City, New Jersey. There were a number of disputes regarding the jurisdictional status of the island during the 20th century.

Liberty Island became part of the Statue of Liberty National Monument in 1937 through Presidential Proclamation 2250, signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1966, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Statue of Liberty National Monument, Ellis Island, and Liberty Island.

== Geography and access ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the island has a land area of , and is the property of the federal government. Liberty Island is located in the Upper New York Bay within the waters of Jersey City, New Jersey. It is one of the islands that are part of the borough of Manhattan in New York. The historical developments which led to this construction made Liberty Island an exclave of one state, New York, in another, New Jersey. Liberty Island is east of Liberty State Park in Jersey City and is southwest of the Battery in Lower Manhattan.

=== State sovereignty disputes ===
====State dispute====
An unusual clause in the 1664 colonial land grant that outlined New Jersey&#x27;s borders reads: &quot;westward of Long Island, and Manhitas Island and bounded on the east part by the main sea, and part by Hudson&#x27;s river&quot; rather than at the river&#x27;s midpoint, as was common in other colonial charters.

In 1824 the City of New York attempted to assert a jurisdictional monopoly over the growing ferry service in New York Harbor in &quot;Gibbons v. Ogden&quot;. It was deemed by the court that interstate transport would be regulated by the federal government. This did not resolve the border issue. In 1830, New Jersey planned to bring suit, but the matter was resolved with a compact between the states ratified by Congress in 1834, which set the boundary line between them as the midpoint of the shared waterway. This would place Bedloe&#x27;s (Liberty) Island and Ellis Island in New Jersey; however, the compact included an exception specifying that they remain the territory of New York. This was later confirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in a 1908 case which also expounded on the compact.
In 1986, a suit brought by New Jersey residents challenging New York state&#x27;s jurisdiction over Liberty Island was dismissed. The same year, U.S. Representative Frank J. Guarini and Gerald McCann, then mayor of Jersey City, sued the government of New York City, contending that New Jersey should have dominion over Liberty Island because it is on the New Jersey side of the state line. Since the court chose not to hear the case, the existing legal status remained unchanged. Portions of the island that are above water are part of New York, while riparian rights to all of the submerged land surrounding the statue belong to New Jersey. The southwestern section, , of the island was created by land reclamation.

In 1998, the United States Supreme Court decided the state jurisdiction of the nearby Ellis Island in &quot;New Jersey v. New York&quot;. Being mostly constructed of artificial infill, New Jersey argued and the court agreed that the 1834 compact covered only the natural parts of the island, and not the portions added by infill. Thus it was agreed that the parts of the island made of filled land belonged to New Jersey while the original natural part belonged to New York. This proved impractical to administer and New Jersey and New York subsequently agreed to share jurisdiction of the entire island. This special situation only applies to Ellis Island and part of Shooters Island.

====Federal ownership====

Liberty Island has been owned by the federal government since 1801, first as a military installation and now as a national landmark. Statue of Liberty National Monument, Ellis Island and Liberty Island, listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1966, encompasses land in both states, control of which is superseded by the United States. The undisputed state boundary between New Jersey and New York is in the center of the Hudson River and the Upper New York Bay, with Liberty Island situated well on the New Jersey side of the water line with Liberty Island itself an exclave of the State of New York and a part of New York City, allowing the state and city of New York to retain sovereignty of Liberty Island, serve process there and collect sales tax from Liberty Island souvenir shops.

In response to a FAQ about whether the Statue of Liberty is in New York or New Jersey, the National Park Service, which oversees Liberty Island, cites the 1834 compact. Question 127 on a naturalization examination piloted in 2006 asks &quot;Where is the Statue of Liberty?&quot; The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services gives &quot;New York Harbor&quot; and &quot;Liberty Island&quot; as preferred answers, but notes that &quot;New Jersey&quot;, &quot;New York&quot;, &quot;New York City&quot;, and &quot;on the Hudson&quot; are acceptable.

Both New York City and Jersey City have assigned the island lot numbers. Utility services, including electricity, water, and sewage, to Liberty and Ellis Islands are provided from the New Jersey side, while mail is delivered from the Battery in New York.

The statue was featured on New York license plates from 1986 through 2000 and on a special New Jersey license plate celebrating Liberty State Park in Jersey City. The statue is also seen on the New York state quarter. The national monument was the symbol of the Central Railroad of New Jersey (which operated along the present-day Raritan Valley Line), whose railroad terminal is nearby.

===Public access===
Two ferry slips are located at the southwestern side of Liberty Island. No charge is made for entrance to the Statue of Liberty National Monument, but there is a cost for the ferry service, as private boats may not dock at the island. A concession was granted in 2007 to Statue Cruises to operate the transportation and ticketing facilities, replacing Circle Line, which had operated the service since 1953. The ferries depart from Liberty State Park in Jersey City and the Battery in Lower Manhattan.

==History==
=== Great Oyster Island ===
At the time of European colonization of the Hudson River estuary in the mid-17th century, much of the west side of Upper New York Bay contained large tidal flats which hosted vast oyster beds, a major source of food for the Lenape native people who lived there at the time. Several islands were not completely submerged at high tide. Three of them (later known as Bedloe&#x27;s/Love/Liberty, Ellis, and Black Tom) were given the name Oyster Islands (&quot;oester eilanden&quot;) by the Dutch settlers of New Netherland, the first European colony in the Mid-Atlantic states. The oyster beds would remain a major source of food for nearly three centuries. Land reclamation, started by the 1870s, particularly by the Lehigh Valley Railroad and Central Railroad of New Jersey, eventually obliterated the beds, engulfed one island and brought the shoreline much closer to the others.

===Bedloe&#x27;s Island===
After the surrender of Fort Amsterdam by the Dutch to the British in 1664, the English governor Richard Nicolls granted the island to Captain Robert Needham. It was sold to Isaac Bedloe on December 23, 1667. The island was retained by his estate until 1732 when it was sold for five shillings to New York merchants Adolphe Philipse and Henry Lane. During their ownership, the island was temporarily commandeered by the city of New York to establish a smallpox quarantine station.

In 1746, Archibald Kennedy (later 11th Earl of Cassilis) purchased the island and a summer residence was established, along with construction of a lighthouse. Seven years later, the island is described in an advertisement (in which &quot;Bedlow&#x27;s&quot; had become &quot;Bedloe&#x27;s&quot;, along with an alternate name of &quot;Love Island&quot;) as being available for rental: 

In 1756, Kennedy allowed the island to again be used as a smallpox quarantine station, and on February 18, 1758, the Corporation of the City of New York bought the island for £1,000 for use as a pest house.

When the British troops occupied New York Harbor in the lead-up to the American Revolutionary War, the island was to be used for housing for Tory refugees, with docked next to it, but on April 2, 1776, the buildings constructed on the island for their use were burned to the ground.

=== Fort Wood ===

On February 15, 1800, the New York State Legislature ceded the island to the federal government, for the construction of a defensive fort to be built there (along with Governors Island and Ellis Island). Construction of a fort on the island in the shape of an 11-point star began in 1806 and was completed in 1811, protecting New York from British invasion in the upcoming conflict. The fort is considered part of the second system of U.S. fortifications. Following the War of 1812, the star-shaped fortification was named Fort Wood after Lt. Col Eleazer Derby Wood who was killed in the Siege of Fort Erie in 1814, a major American defensive victory against British troops near the war&#x27;s end. The granite fortification followed an 11-pointed star fort layout, mounting 24 guns. A larger fort mounting 77 guns was proposed under the third system of US fortifications but was not built.

By the time it was chosen for the Statue of Liberty in the 1880s, the fort was outmoded and obsolete, disused and its substantial stone walls were then used as the distinctive base for the Statue of Liberty given by the Third French Republic for the American 1876 centenary celebrations. It had become a part of the base for the Statue of Liberty after the island was first seen by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, the statue&#x27;s sculptor. The National Park Service (which had been created in 1916) took over operations of the island in two stages: in 1933, and the remainder in 1937. The military installation was completely removed by 1944.

=== Statue of Liberty ===
The statue, entitled &quot;Liberty Enlightening the World&quot;, was a gift from the people of France to mark the American Centennial. It was agreed that the Congress would authorize the acceptance of the statue by the President of the United States, and that the War Department would facilitate its construction and presentation.

The construction of the statue was completed in France in July 1884. The cornerstone was laid on August 5, 1884, and after some funding delays, construction of the pedestal was finished on April 22, 1886. The statue arrived in New York Harbor on June 17, 1885, on board the French frigate &quot;Isère&quot;, was stored for eleven months in crates waiting for its pedestal to be finished, and was then reassembled in four months. On October 28, 1886, the Statue of Liberty was unveiled by President Grover Cleveland. The name Liberty Island was made official by Congress in 1956.

== Museums ==
===American Museum of Immigration===
The American Museum of Immigration formerly operated at Liberty Island. It was dedicated on September 26, 1972, in a ceremony presided over by President of the United States Richard Nixon. The museum closed in 1991 following the opening of the Ellis Island Immigration Museum.

===Statue of Liberty Museum===
On October 7, 2016, construction started on the new Statue of Liberty Museum on Liberty Island. The new $70 million, museum is able to accommodate all of the island&#x27;s visitors, as opposed to the former museum, which only 20 percent of the island&#x27;s daily visitors could visit. The original torch is located here along with exhibits relating to the statue&#x27;s construction and history. There is a theater where visitors can watch an aerial view of the statue.

The museum, designed by FXFOWLE Architects, is integrated with the parkland around it. It is being funded privately by Diane von Fürstenberg, Michael Bloomberg, Jeff Bezos, Coca-Cola, NBCUniversal, the family of Laurence Tisch and Preston Robert Tisch, Mellody Hobson, and George Lucas. Von Fürstenberg headed the fundraising for the museum, and the project raised more than $40 million in fundraising as of groundbreaking. The museum opened on May 16, 2019.

<doc id="421951" wikidata="Q7164346" url="?curid=421951" title="Penny Black printing plates">
<text>The printing plates for the Penny Black, two pence blue and the VR official were all constructed by Perkins Bacon, the printers of the first postage stamps issued in Great Britain.

== Construction stages ==
The construction of these plates was long and complicated, which was intentional so as to make the forgery of the finished article almost impossible.

The first stage involved the engraving of a background for the design. This was produced with a rose engine which laid down a circular pattern of symmetrical design onto a piece of soft steel. This was then partly cleared to leave a square shape and an area in the centre was further cleared in the shape of Queen Victoria&#x27;s head ready for engraving.

At this stage the die was passed to the engravers who, working from a sketch provided by Henry Cole, engraved the head in the centre.

Following this the labels were engraved at the top and bottom of the die, along with corner squares to take the stars and check letters. Finally the stars were engraved into the top corners.

At this stage the die was hardened and a series of impressions made on a transfer roller, which—as its name implies—was used to transfer the image from the die to the printing plate. The roller was sufficient in size to take between 2 and 8 impressions from the original master die. Once these images were complete on the roller, this was in turn hardened.

A sheet of soft steel was cut, sufficient in size to take 240 impressions of the stamps arranged in twenty horizontal rows of twelve. Onto this plate a series of guide dots were marked, some of which were joined with guide lines to allow the correct registration of the impressions. Many of these dots and lines show on the printed stamps and allow them to be correctly assigned to the plate from which they were printed.

Using the transfer roller, the impressions were transferred to the plate under great pressure until the required 240 impressions were completed. Finally the check letters were inserted into the lower corner using hand punches. As such the position of these letters on each stamp differs slightly from one plate to the next and provide an aid for collectors wishing to assign a given stamp impression to its correct plate. Finally the marginal inscriptions were added to the four sides of the sheet using a separate roller and the plate hardened ready for use in production.

<doc id="421953" wikidata="Q285544" url="?curid=421953" title="Duke of Exeter">
<text>The title Duke of Exeter was created several times in England in the later Middle Ages. Exeter is the main town of Devon. It was first created for John Holland, the half-brother of King Richard II in 1397. That title was rescinded upon Henry IV&#x27;s accession to the throne two years later. The title was then granted to the former&#x27;s half-brother, Thomas Beaufort, 1st Earl of Dorset by his nephew Henry V. Following Beaufort&#x27;s death without heirs in 1426, the title was restored to the Holland family, which held it until the 3rd Duke was attainted in 1461 as a Lancastrian, dying in 1475.

==Dukes of Exeter, first creation (1397)==

*John Holland, 1st Duke of Exeter (1352–1400), half-brother of Richard II, was executed for treason against his half-brother&#x27;s cousin and rival Henry IV Bolingbroke, at which point his honours were deprived.

===Coat of arms===
*Arms: The arms of England (gules, three lions passant or), within a border azure, charged with fleur-de-lis of the second.
*Crest: The royal lion on a chapeau, gorged with a collar azure, charged with fleurs-de-lis, and ducally crowned.

==Dukes of Exeter, second creation (1416)==

*Thomas Beaufort, Duke of Exeter (c. 1377–1426), third legitimated son of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster (himself the third son of Edward III), died without issue, thus the dukedom was extinct.

===Coat of arms===
*Arms: The arms of England (quarterly: first and fourth, azure, three fleurs-de-lis; second and third, gules, three lions passant or), within a border gobony azure and ermine.
*Crest: A portcullis or, nailed azure, chains of the first.

==Dukes of Exeter, third creation (1444)==
:Sometimes numbered 2nd and 3rd dukes in reference to the 1397 creation
* John Holland, 2nd Duke of Exeter, 1st in this creation (1395–1447), son of the 1st Duke of the 1397 creation, was restored to his father&#x27;s honours after service to his cousin, the Lancastrian king, Henry V
* Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter, 2nd in this creation (1430–1475), son of preceding, titles forfeited 1461

<doc id="421954" wikidata="Q7834971" url="?curid=421954" title="Transport in Czechoslovakia">
<text>Czechoslovakia was one of Europe&#x27;s major transit countries for north-south movement. As of 1985, Czechoslovakia had:
*a highly developed transport system consisting of of railway tracks, of roads, and of inland waterways, according to official sources.
* of pipelines for transport of crude oil, for refined products, and for natural gas.
*a total cargo movement of over 99 billion ton-kilometres
*of the nearly 90 billion ton-kilometres of cargo-carrying service performed by public transport, railways handled about 81%, roads 13%, inland waterways 5%, and civil aviation less than 1%.

The state owned and subsidized the means of transport, and passenger fares were among the lowest in the world.

Major improvements were made in the transport infrastructure after World War II, particularly with regard to the railways, and the result was a relatively extensive and dense road and railway network. In developing the transport system, the government&#x27;s primary goal was to facilitate movement of industrial goods; passenger traffic, while not neglected, received secondary consideration. Nevertheless, in the 1980s transport frequently was a bottleneck in the economy because of low operating efficiency and long-term inadequate investment. In the mid-1980s, both rail and highway transport systems were in need of substantial upgrading. Although the shortcomings of the systems were well known and received considerable public attention, limited funding slowed the pace of improvement. Since the 1970s, in an effort to save fuel, the government had been encouraging the displacement of goods transport from the highways to the railways.

== Overview ==
*Railways: In 1985 total of , of which was standard gauge, broad gauge, and narrow gauge; double tracked and electrified. Track and beds suffered from inadequate maintenance.
*Roads: In 1983 total of , of which paved and gravelled. Roads poorly maintained.
*Inland waterways: About in 1985.
*Pipelines: In 1987 about for crude oil, for refined products, and for natural gas. Network linked domestic oil and gas fields to refineries. Pipelines also linked to large international lines bringing Soviet crude oil and gas to the border.
*Freight: In 1985 about 81% of long-distance freight carried by rail. Truck transport accounted for 13%, inland waterways for 5%, and civil aviation less than 1% of freight traffic.
*Ports: No seaports; used Gdynia, Gdańsk, and Szczecin in Poland; Rijeka and Koper in Yugoslavia; Hamburg in West Germany; and Rostock in East Germany. Czechoslovakia had its own fleet and chartered vessels for international cargo. Main river ports Prague, Bratislava, Děčín, and Komárno.
*Telecommunications: Adequate, modern, automatic system with direct dial connections with many parts of country and most European countries. In 1985 about 23.2 per 100 inhabitants. In January 1987 fifty-four AM, and fourteen FM radio stations, forty-five televisions stations, and eleven Soviet television relays.

== Transport modes ==

=== Rail ===
In 1985 about 22% of the tracks in the rail network were double track. About 28% were electrified, including the main east-west Friendship Railway linking Prague with the Soviet border, which formed the basis of the network. Situated near the centre of Europe, Czechoslovakia had rail links to surrounding countries, and transit traffic moved in all directions. Many of the difficulties of the railways were caused by lack of new equipment, poor maintenance of tracks and rolling stock (partly caused by the lack of spare parts), an insufficient number of skilled workers, and constant pressure to keep operating. The railway management also had to cope with outdated station facilities.

=== Road ===
The highway system has received less attention than the railways during the decades since World War II. Most improvements have focused on local roads, and, in general, the country has been slow to develop modern highways. Nevertheless, highway cargo movement increased rapidly in the 1960s and 1970s, doubling between 1970 and 1979. It was only in 1980 that a modern superhighway was completed linking the three largest cities (Prague, Brno, and Bratislava), a distance of . This project had started in 1938 and was left uncompleted from the early 1940s to the late 1960s. In 1985 approximately , or somewhat less than 1% of the road network, consisted of superhighways. Public officials acknowledged that the status and maintenance of the system remained inadequate for the country&#x27;s needs.

=== Maritime ports ===
As a landlocked country, Czechoslovakia has no maritime ports. There were maritime ports rented for 99 years. The last one rented was in Szczecin Poland and Hamburg Germany. Czechoslovakia had an ocean fleet of about 47 cargo ships. The fleet was dissolved and privatized by communist crook Kožený during the 90&#x27;s after velvet revolution. 
In the mid-1980s, the country&#x27;s overseas trade passed through East German, West German, Polish and Yugoslav ports. The Elbe and Danube rivers were both navigable in Czechoslovakia. In the 1980s, the Vltava was carrying increasing amounts of traffic and efforts were underway to make it more extensively navigable. Principal river ports were located at Prague, Děčín, Komárno and Bratislava.

=== Civil aviation ===
Civil aviation played a particularly significant role in the movement of passengers. Czechoslovak Airlines, the state airline company, serviced most European cities and also provided domestic services. A regional airline, Slov-Air, headquartered in Bratislava, provided additional domestic service. In 1985 civil aviation handled 1.2 million travellers. About 90% of this transport service consisted of international flights.

=== Communications ===
In the mid-1980s, Czechoslovakia had a relatively well developed communications system. According to official data, there were 3,591,045 telephones in the country in 1985, about 23.2 telephones for every 100 persons, the greatest density of telephones among Comecon countries. There were 4,233,702 licensed radios, or one for every 3.7 persons and 4,368,050 licensed televisions, or one for every 3.6 persons. Both journalism and broadcasting were closely supervised by the government, but many inhabitants could receive West German or Austrian television and radio transmissions as well as Czechoslovak broadcasts.

<doc id="421981" wikidata="Q312588" url="?curid=421981" title="Substitute good">
<text>In microeconomics, substitute goods are two goods that can be used for the same purpose by consumers. That is, a consumer perceives both goods as similar or comparable, so that having more of one good causes the consumer to desire less of the other good. Contrary to complementary goods and independent goods, substitute goods may replace each other in use due to changing economic conditions. An example of substitute goods is Coca-Cola and Pepsi; the interchangeable aspect of these goods is due to the similarity of the purpose they serve, i.e. fulfilling customers&#x27; desire for a soft drink. These types of substitutes can be referred to as close substitutes.

Substitute goods are commodity which the consumer demanded to be used in place of another good.

Economic theory describes two goods as being close substitutes if three conditions hold:

# products have the same or similar performance characteristics 
# products have the same or similar occasion for use and
# products are sold in the same geographic area
Performance characteristics describe what the product does for the customer; a solution to customers&#x27; needs or wants. For example, a beverage would quench a customer&#x27;s thirst.

A product&#x27;s occasion for use describes when, where and how it is used. For example, orange juice and soft drinks are both beverages but are used by consumers in different occasions (i.e. breakfast vs during the day).

Two products are in different geographic market if they are sold in different locations, it is costly to transport the goods or it is costly for consumers to travel to buy the goods.

Only if the two products satisfy the three conditions, will they be classified as close substitutes according to economic theory. The opposite of a substitute good is a complementary good, these are goods that are dependent on another. An example of complementary goods are cereal and milk.

An example of substitute goods are tea and coffee. These two goods satisfy the three conditions: tea and coffee have similar performance characteristics (they quench a thirst), they both have similar occasions for use (in the morning) and both are usually sold in the same geographic area (consumers can buy both at their local supermarket). Some other common examples include margarine and butter, and McDonald&#x27;s and Burger King.

Formally, good formula_1 is a substitute for good formula_2 if when the price of formula_2 rises the demand for formula_1 rises, see figure 1.

Let formula_5 be the price of good formula_2. Then, formula_1 is a substitute for formula_2 if: formula_9.

== Cross elasticity of demand ==
The fact that one good is substitutable for another has immediate economic consequences: insofar as one good can be substituted for another, the demands for the two goods will be interrelated by the fact that customers can trade off one good for the other if it becomes advantageous to do so. Cross-price elasticity helps us understand the degree of substitutability of the two products. An increase in the price of a good will increase demand for its substitutes, while a decrease in the price of a good will decrease demand for its substitutes, see Figure 2.

The relationship between demand schedules determines whether goods are classified as substitutes or complements. The cross-price elasticity of demand shows the relationship between two goods, it captures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of one good to a change in price of another good.

Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand (&quot;E&quot;x,y) is calculated with the following formula:

&quot;E&quot;x,y = Percentage Change in Quantity Demanded for Good X / Percentage Change in Price of Good Y

The cross-price elasticity may be positive or negative, depending on whether the goods are complements or substitutes. A substitute good is a good with a positive cross elasticity of demand. This means that, if good formula_1 is a substitute for good formula_2, an increase in the price of formula_2 will result in a leftward movement along the demand curve of formula_2 and cause the demand curve for formula_1 to shift out. A decrease in the price of formula_2 will result in a rightward movement along the demand curve of formula_2 and cause the demand curve for formula_1 to shift in. Furthermore, perfect substitutes have a higher cross elasticity of demand than imperfect substitutes do.

==Types==
=== Perfect and imperfect substitutes ===
====Perfect substitutes====

Perfect substitutes refer to a pair of goods with uses identical to one another. In that case, the utility of a combination of the two goods is an increasing function of the sum of the quantity of each good. That is, the more the consumer can consume (in total quantity), the higher level of utility will be achieved, see figure 3.

Perfect substitutes have a linear utility function and a constant marginal rate of substitution, see figure 3. If goods X and Y are perfect substitutes, any different consumption bundle will result in the consumer obtaining the same utility level for all the points on the indifference curve (utility function). Let a consumption bundle be represented by (X,Y), then, a consumer of perfect substitutes would receive the same level of utility from (20,10) or (30,0).

Consumers of perfect substitutes base their rational decision-making process on prices only. Evidently, the consumer will choose the cheapest bundle to maximise their profits. If the prices of the goods differed, there would be no demand for the more expensive good. Producers and sellers of perfect substitute goods directly compete with each other, that is, they are known to be in direct price competition.

An example of perfect substitutes is butter from two different producers; the producer may be different but their purpose and usage are the same.

Perfect substitutes have a high cross-elasticity of demand. For example, if Country Crock and Imperial margarine have the same price listed for the same amount of spread, but one brand increases its price, its sales will fall by a certain amount. In response, the other brand&#x27;s sales will increase by the same amount.

====Imperfect substitutes====

Imperfect substitutes, also known as close substitutes, have a lesser level of substitutability, and therefore exhibit variable marginal rates of substitution along the consumer indifference curve. The consumption points on the curve offer the same level of utility as before, but compensation depends on the starting point of the substitution. Unlike perfect substitutes (see figure 4), the indifference curves of imperfect substitutes are not linear and the marginal rate of substitution is different for different set of combinations on the curve. Close substitute goods are similar products that target the same customer groups and satisfy the same needs, but have slight differences in characteristics. Sellers of close substitute goods are therefore in indirect competition with each other.

Beverages are a great example of imperfect substitutes. As the price of Coca-Cola rises, consumers could be expected to substitute to Pepsi. However, many consumers prefer one brand over the other. Consumers who prefer one brand over the other will not trade between them one-to-one. Rather, a consumer who prefers Coca-Cola (for example) will be willing to exchange more Pepsi for less Coca-Cola, in other words, consumers who prefer Coca-Cola would be willing to pay more.

The degree to which a good has a perfect substitute depends on how specifically the good is defined. The broader the definition of a good, the easier it is for the good to have a substitute good. On the other hand, a good narrowly defined will be likely to not have a substitute good. For example, different types of cereal generally are substitutes for each other, but Rice Krispies cereal, which is a very narrowly defined good as compared to cereal generally, has few, if any substitutes. To illustrate this further, we can imagine that while both Rice Krispies and Froot Loops are types of cereal, they are imperfect substitutes, as the two are very different types of cereal. However, generic brands of Rice Krispies, such as Malt-o-Meal&#x27;s Crispy Rice would be a perfect substitute for Kellogg&#x27;s Rice Krispies.

Imperfect substitutes have a low cross-elasticity of demand. If two brands of cereal have the same prices before one&#x27;s price is raised, we can expect sales to fall for that brand. However, sales will not raise by the same amount for the other brand, as there are many types of cereal that are equally substitutable for the brand which has raised its price; consumer preferences determine which brands pick up their losses.

=== Gross and net substitutes ===
If two goods are imperfect substitutes, economists can distinguish them as gross substitutes or net substitutes. Good formula_1 is a gross substitute for good formula_2 if, when the price of good formula_2 increases, spending on good formula_1 increases, as described above. Gross substitutability is not a symmetric relationship. Even if formula_1 is a gross substitute for formula_2, it may not be true that formula_2 is a gross substitute for formula_1.

Two goods are net substitutes when the demand for good X increases when the price of good Y increases and the utility derived from the substitute remains constant.

Goods formula_2 and formula_1 are said to be net substitutes if 
:formula_28

That is, goods are net substitutes if they are substitutes for each other under a constant utility function. Net substitutability has the desirable property that, unlike gross substitutability, it is symmetric:

:formula_29

That is, if good formula_1 is a net substitute for good formula_2, then good formula_2 is also a net substitute for good formula_1. The symmetry of net substitution is both intuitively appealing and theoretically useful.

The common misconception is that competitive equilibrium is non-existent when it comes to products that are net substitutes. Like most times when products are gross substitutes, they will also likely be net substitutes, hence most gross substitute preferences supporting a competitive equilibrium also serve as examples of net substitutes doing the same. This misconception can be further clarified by looking at the nature of net substitutes which exists in a purely hypothetical situation where a fictitious entity interferes to shut down the income effect and maintain a constant utility function. This defeats the point of a competitive equilibrium, where no such intervention takes place. The equilibrium is decentralized and left to the producers and consumers to determine and arrive at an equilibrium price.

=== Within-category and cross-category substitutes ===

Within-category substitutes are goods that are members of the same taxonomic category such as goods sharing common attributes (e.g., chocolate, chairs, station wagons).

Cross-category substitutes are goods that are members of different taxonomic categories but can satisfy the same goal. A person who wants chocolate but cannot acquire it, for example, might instead buy ice cream to satisfy the goal of having a dessert.

Whether goods are cross-category or within-category substitutes influences the utility derived by consumers. In the case of food, people exhibit a strong preference for within-category substitutes over cross-category substitutes, despite cross-category substitutes being more effective at satisfying customers&#x27; needs. Across ten sets of different foods, 79.7% of research participants believed that a within-category substitute would better satisfy their craving for a food they could not have than a cross-category substitute. Unable to acquire a desired Godiva chocolate, for instance, a majority reported that they would prefer to eat a store-brand chocolate (a within-category substitute) than a chocolate-chip granola bar (a cross-category substitute). This preference for within-category food substitutes appears, however, to be misguided. Because within-category food substitutes are more similar to the missing food, their inferiority to it is more noticeable. This creates a negative contrast effect, and leads within-category substitutes to be less satisfying substitutes than cross-category substitutes unless the quality is comparable.

===Unit-demand goods===
Unit-demand goods are categories of goods from which consumer wants only a single item. If the consumer has two unit-demand items, then his utility is the &quot;maximum&quot; of the utilities he gains from each of these items. For example, consider a consumer that wants a means of transportation, which may be either a car or a bicycle. The consumer prefers a car to a bicycle. If the consumer has both a car and a bicycle, then the consumer uses only the car. The economic theory of unit elastic demand illustrates the inverse relationship between price and quantity. Unit-demand goods are always substitutes.

==In perfect and monopolistic market structures==

===Perfect competition===
Perfect competition is solely based on firms having equal conditions and the continuous pursuit of these conditions, regardless of the market size One of the requirements for perfect competition is that the goods of competing firms should be perfect substitutes. Products sold by different firms have minimal differences in capabilities, features, and pricing. Thus, buyers cannot distinguish between products based on physical attributes or intangible value. When this condition is not satisfied, the market is characterized by product differentiation. A perfectly competitive market is a theoretical benchmark and does not exist in reality. However, perfect substitutability is significant in the era of deregulation because there are usually several competing providers (e.g., electricity suppliers) selling the same good which result in aggressive price competition.

===Monopolistic competition===
Monopolistic competition characterizes an industry in which many firms offer products or services that are close, but not perfect substitutes. Monopolistic firms have little power to set curtail supply or raise prices to increase profits. Thus, the firms will try to differentiate their product through branding and marketing to capture above market returns. Some common examples of monopolistic industries include gasoline, milk, Internet connectivity (ISP services), electricity, telephony, and airline tickets. Since firms offer similar products, demand is highly elastic in monopolistic competition. As a result of demand being very responsive to price changes, consumers will switch to the cheapest alternative as a result of price increases. This is known as switching costs, or essentially what the consumers are willing to give up.

==Market effects==
The Michael Porter invented &quot;Porter&#x27;s Five Forces&quot; to analyse an industry&#x27;s attractiveness and likely profitability. Alongside competitive rivalry, buyer power, supplier power and threat of new entry, Porter identifies the threat of substitution as one of the five important industry forces. The threat of substitution refers to the likelihood of customers finding alternative products to purchase. When close substitutes are available, customers can easily and quickly forgo buying a company&#x27;s product by finding other alternatives. This can weaken a company&#x27;s power which threatens long-term profitability. The risk of substitution can be considered high when:

* Customers have slight switching costs between two available substitutes.
* The quality and performance offered by a close substitute are of a higher standard.
* Customers of a product have low loyalty towards the brand or product, hence being more sensitive to price changes.

Additionally substitute goods have a large impact on markets, consumer and sellers through the following factors:

# Markets characterised by close/perfect substitute goods experience great volatility in prices. This volatility negatively impacts producers&#x27; profits, as it is possible to earn higher profits in markets with fewer substitute products. That is, perfect substitute results in profits being driven down to zero as seen in perfectly competitive markets equilibrium.
# As a result of the intense competition caused the availability of substitute goods, low quality products can arise. Since prices are reduced to capture a larger share of the market, firms try to reduce their utilisation of resources which in turn will reduce their costs.
# In a market with close/perfect substitutes, customers have a wide range of products to choose from. As the number of substitutes increase, the probability that every consumer selects what is right for them also increases. That is, consumers can reach a higher overall utility level from the availability of substitute products.

<doc id="421984" wikidata="Q2584217" url="?curid=421984" title="Dazzler (Marvel Comics)">
<text>Dazzler (Alison Blaire) is a superheroine appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, often in association with the X-Men. She first appeared in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #130 (February 1980).

A mutant with the ability to convert sound vibrations into light and energy beams, Dazzler was developed as a cross-promotional, multi-media creation between Casablanca Records and Marvel Comics until the tie-ins were dropped in 1980. The character was created by a committee of Marvel staff, principally writer/editor Tom DeFalco and illustrator John Romita Jr. She starred in a self-titled series in the early 1980s which lasted forty-two issues, a Marvel Graphic Novel titled &quot;Dazzler: The Movie&quot;, a four-issue limited series co-starring The Beast titled &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, and later joined the cast of &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot;. She has also featured in other Marvel teams.

Dazzler&#x27;s sexuality has given the character popularity among the LGBT community.

Halston Sage portrays Dazzler in &quot;Dark Phoenix&quot;.

==Creation==
Dazzler was conceived in early 1979 as a joint venture between Marvel Comics and Casablanca Records, a subsidiary of Universal Music Group that had achieved considerable success with notable disco acts including Donna Summer and Village People. Accounts differ as to which party made the first move; in 1986 Louise Simonson would tell &quot;Amazing Heroes&quot; that Casablanca approached Marvel; however, in a 2011 blog post Jim Shooter would credit the idea to Marvel employee Alice Donenfeld and based on the success of The Archies, who later pitched it to Casablanca supremo Neil Bogart. Bogart was enthusiastic, not only wanting to produce music &#x27;by&#x27; the character (who initially had the working name of &#x27;Disco Queen&#x27;) but also launch it with a half-hour animated special featuring numerous Marvel characters. Marvel began shaping the character; Shooter assigned the development to Tom DeFalco (who, like Shooter, had experience working at Archie Comics), Roger Stern, Roberta &#x27;Dickie&#x27; Mackenzie and John Romita Jr. while continuing to oversee the project himself. Shooter recalled that DeFalco pitched the name &#x27;Evelyn Free&#x27; (a pun on &quot;evil and free&quot;) for the character&#x27;s civilian identity before the group decided on Alison Blaire. At this stage much about the character was in flux; Romita Jr. initially designed her as African American, heavily based on singer/actress Grace Jones with a costume inspired by the skin-tight and revealing eveningwear he had seen on women at New York nightclubs; her name was changed, first to Disco Dazzler and then to simply Dazzler at the suggestion of Stern; and initially her powers were to be an ability to make people tell the truth. DeFalco objected to the latter, feeling it was &quot;not very interesting for a comic book&quot;. Instead he successfully suggested that as her name was Dazzler light-based powers made more sense. Casablanca held final approval over the character at this stage, and vetoed some of Marvel&#x27;s ideas. DeFalco would recall that the numerous delays led the creative team to believe disco &quot;would be dead&quot; before Dazzler&#x27;s debut as the various parties hammered out the initial story, which DeFalco and Romita turned into an origin story

Meanwhile, the multimedia side of the project changed several times. Shooter had produced a pitch for the TV special that had impressed Bogart so much he wanted to turn it into a live-action special with many stars he had under contract (including Cher, Donna Summer, Kiss, Lenny and Squiggy, Robin Williams and the Village People) to appear as Marvel characters. However, soon afterwards Casablanca struck financial trouble, and Bogart was forced out of the company. Instead filmmaker John Derek showed interest in Dazzler as a potential film vehicle for his wife Bo, who were looking to build on the success of &quot;10&quot; with studio Filmworks. As such the comic character was redesigned to more closely resemble Derek herself, becoming a white blonde, requiring Romita Jr. to redraw the work already done on the comic. The artist was unimpressed with the changes to the lead character. According to DeFalco, the Dereks&#x27; involvement in the project ended after the poor reception of their vehicle &quot;Tarzan, the Ape Man&quot;

==Publishing history==
Marvel had planned to release the 34-page Dazzler comic as part of the &quot;Marvel Comics Super Special&quot; series, which generally dealt with media adaptations, while some thought was also given to releasing it as a black-and-white magazine. After Casablanca and Filmworks both withdrew, Marvel shipped the concept around other record labels and film studios without success. While this was happening, Dazzler had appeared in other titles to build anticipation. The character had debuted in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #130 (dated February 1980) as an ally of the X-Men, and subsequently guested in issues of &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; (#203, April 1980) and &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; (#217, April 1980). Due to the character still being in flux while these issues were produced they featured some inconsistencies - Richard Gagnon of &quot;Amazing Heroes&quot; noted the character was considerably more streetwise in her &quot;X-Men&quot; appearance than she would be for most of her subsequent appearances, while in the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; guest spot Dazzler fired beams from her eyes due to DeFalco having to tell Marv Wolfman to simply take pot luck over which of the three potential variations in powers Casablanca were mulling over at the time would be finalised.

===&quot;Dazzler&quot; (1981-1985)===
Rather than simply have the work done go to waste, Shooter decided to repackage it as an ongoing comic series. DeFalco would write additional exposition and other material to turn the 34-page one-shot into two 22-page single issues. As Romita Jr. had moved on to other projects an uncredited Walt Simonson provided the art for the new pages. In order to make the debut still something of an event, Shooter decided it would be Marvel&#x27;s first ongoing series that was exclusive to the direct market - i.e. sold only to specialist comic stores, rather than also to newsstands - a model used by several smaller independent publishers. This also made the comic non-returnable for retailers. Given a healthy promotional push, the first issue - dated May 1981 - was a resounding commercial success for Marvel, with around 400,000 copies sold to stores - around double the number of most of the company&#x27;s best-selling titles.

With the Romita Jr. material running out midway through the third issue (which also featured work from Alan Kupperberg), Frank Springer became the title&#x27;s new regular artist. The first issues contained a plethora of Marvel&#x27;s finest as guest stars as a legacy of the book&#x27;s origin as a one-off special, and the pattern was kept up for the early issues of the title to support the new character&#x27;s sales - &quot;Dazzler&quot; #3-4 featured Doctor Doom; #6-7 guest-starred Hulk; #9 saw an appearance by Quasar; and #10-11 saw Dazzler cross paths with Galactus. Some of these appearances drew criticism due to the unsubtle way many of Marvel&#x27;s established heroes were in awe of the newcomer. After issue 6 DeFalco left the title, partly due to his growing editorial commitments at Marvel and partly because he was disagreeing over the direction of the series with Springer, who wanted to draw more on romance comics than traditional superhero fare. &quot;Dazzler&quot; #8 also saw another talent added to the book, with Bill Sienkiewicz contributing the first of what would be a number of covers for the series.

DeFalco&#x27;s replacement was relative newcomer Danny Fingeroth, initially working from his predecessor&#x27;s outlines. Fingeroth would also write Dazzler&#x27;s first appearance in alternative universe anthology title &quot;What If&quot;, contributing a story that was based on the Galactus storyline from &quot;Dazzler&quot; #10-11. Issue #17 saw the start of a short stint by the X-Men team-member Angel as a suitor; Fingeroth would admit this was an attempt to draw readers to the series, which had not kept up its early sales. As with other guest appearances, Angel&#x27;s behaviour in his &quot;Dazzler&quot; appearances drew mixed responses, with Gagnon describing him as &quot;boorish&quot;. &quot;Dazzler&quot; #20 introduced the villains Doctor Sax and Johnny Guitar, named by Fingeroth after the Jack Kerouac book and the Nicholas Ray film respectively, while #21 was an extra-sized issue exploring the fates of Alison&#x27;s parents; Fingeroth felt such human interest was an important part of a superhero series&#x27; appeal to readers. It also featured another unusual attempt to make the title stand out - a photo cover of model June McDonald posing as Dazzler. The following issue saw Fingeroth also leave the title; Springer briefly wrote and drew the title, before scripts by Shooter and Ken McDonald. Despite a change of direction that saw Dazzler change from a singer in New York to an aspiring actress in Los Angeles (which also saw the much-derided original costume finally dropped for a series of leotards) the series&#x27; fortunes failed to improve, and from #31 the title switched to bi-monthly publication. &quot;Dazzler&quot; #32 saw Mike Carlin take over for an ultimately short stint as writer, and shortly afterwards Geof Isherwood started art duties on the title.

In an attempt to draw more attention to the series Shooter, Springer and Vince Colletta created &quot;Dazzler the Movie&quot;, the twelfth entry in the &quot;Marvel Graphic Novel&quot; series; the story publicly outed Alison as a mutant, a development that would drive subsequent issues. It did little to boost sales, and Gagnon would later call &quot;Dazzler the Movie&quot; &quot;the most extravagant waste of the graphic novel format to date&quot;. In the regular series, &quot;Dazzler&quot; #33 featured a Sienkiewicz cover closely referencing Michael Jackson&#x27;s hugely popular &quot;Thriller&quot; music video, and cameos by long-dormant Marvel humour characters Millie the Model and Chili Storm.

Another attempt to find an audience came with the spin-off mini-series &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, pairing Dazzler with the popular Hank McCoy, at the time a member of the Defenders. The series was written by Ann Nocenti, and along with Louise Simonson&#x27;s &quot;Power Pack&quot; and Trina Robbins&#x27; fashion comic &quot;Misty&quot; was an attempt by Marvel to find the female audience the publisher had lost over the previous decade. To this end Nocenti attempted to write &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; as a romance comic, though she would later reflect it was a &quot;tough assignment&quot; pairing a &quot;blonde airhead&quot; with a &quot;deep intellectual&quot;.

&quot;Dazzler&quot; #38 saw another new direction, with the popular Archie Goodwin as writer and Paul Chadwick as artist. Goodwin redesigned the character&#x27;s costume and planned to return the series to superheroics rather than personal and showbiz drama. He would later admit he took the &quot;Dazzler&quot; series on as no-one else wanted it and he needed work at the time. Chadwick had caught Goodwin&#x27;s eye after pitching his creator-owned series &quot;Concrete&quot; when the latter was an Epic Comics editor. Goodwin also introduced bounty hunter O. Z. Chase to the series as a supporting character. The relaunch attracted a mild improvement in critical response, but following &quot;Dazzler&quot; #40 (which tied into the &quot;Secret Wars II&quot; crossover) Goodwin and Chadwick were told the series would be ending after two further issues due to poor sales, ending after #42 (dated March 1986). While sanguine about his experiences on the book, Chadwick would later note the modifications to the cover of the final issue - which saw another artist add the Beast to his original work - was a factor in his decision to return to launching &quot;Concrete&quot; rather than to continue working with Marvel.

At the time the series was not greatly mourned; reviewing the final issue of the series for &quot;Amazing Heroes&quot;, R. A. Jones felt &quot;Dazzler&quot; would &quot;not be missed&quot; and criticized its lack of success across several genres - though also expressed that the book might have been more successful if Goodwin and Chadwick had arrived earlier. Shortly afterwards in the same publication, Richard Gagnon described it as &quot;easily one of the worst comics that Marvel Comics Group has ever put out&quot;.

Retrospective reviews have been kinder, however. Angelo Delos Trinos of &quot;CBR.com&quot; ranked the &quot;Dazzler&quot; comic book series 5th in their &quot;10 Times Comics Changed The World&quot; list, writing, &quot;The &#x27;80s were some of comics&#x27; most profitable years, and this was thanks in part to the growing speculator market. Publishers were already moving away from young readers to adults who treated comics more as an investment than populist entertainment. They finalized this shift after &quot;Dazzler&quot; #1, by Tom Defalco, John Romita Senior and Junior, John Buscema, Alfredo Alcala, Bob McCleod, and Glynis Wein became a blockbuster.&quot;

===Subsequent appearances===
Following the cancellation of &quot;Dazzler&quot;, the character was considered as a possible founding member of X-Factor, but the decision to resurrect Jean Grey put that idea aside. Instead, Dazzler would find a home in the pages of &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot;, still under the aegis of Chris Claremont - who had scripted the character&#x27;s debut appearance. In-fiction Dazzler had twice turned down membership of the X-Men before finally joining the team from &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #214 (dated February 1987) and would go on to be a member of the team until #248, when she was effectively written out after travelling through the Siege Perilous and losing her memory.

Subsequently, Dazzler made only occasional appearances between 1989 and 2005, before returning to regularly featuring in monthly publication for the first time in 15 years when she joined the cast of &quot;New Excalibur&quot;. &quot;New Excalibur&quot; also saw Dazzler gain the power of being able to instantly resurrect herself, a development that was effectively forgotten about soon afterwards. After the title was canceled, Dazzler was brought back as a supporting character in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; written by Matt Fraction.

In February 2010, Marvel published a one-shot &quot;Dazzler&quot; special by writer Jim McCann and artist Kalman Andrasofszky as part of the &quot;Women of Marvel&quot; series. According to Diamond Comic Distributors, the special was the 115th best selling comic book of May 2010. Doug Zawisza of &quot;CBR.com&quot; called &quot;Dazzler&quot; #1 a &quot;&quot;Greatest Hits&quot; comic album of Dazzler&#x27;s best material&quot;, while Bryan Joel of &quot;IGN&quot;, calling the character &quot;a great candidate to show off the themes central to the &quot;Women of Marvel&quot; drive.&quot;

The 2012 series &quot;X-Treme X-Men&quot; featured Dazzler as the leader of a dimension-hopping X-Men team, and later that year she appeared &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; as an agent of superspy outfit S.H.I.E.L.D. Beginning in May 2015, Dazzler appeared as one of the main characters in &quot;A-Force&quot;, an all-female Avengers launched by G. Willow Wilson, Marguerite Bennett, and Jorge Molina during Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline.

2018 saw the character feature in another starring one-shot, &quot;Dazzler: X-Song&quot;. The issue was the 100th best selling comic book in June 2018. and received positive reviews, with Mike Fugere of &quot;CBR.com&quot; referring to it as &quot;the most important X-story Marvel has published in years&quot;, noting &quot;Maybe Dazzler isn’t the beckon [sic] of social progress we were looking for, but it seems she has become the one we have.&quot; Joshua Davison of &quot;Bleeding Cool&quot; stated, &quot;&quot;&#x27;Dazzler: X-Song&quot; #1 is an excellent self-contained story centering around the ever-lovable Allison Blaire of the X-Men. The themes are interesting, the characters that are supposed to be likable succeed in being so, and the art looks great.&quot;

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life===
Alison Blaire was born in Gardendale, New York to Carter Blaire and Katherine Blaire. Her mutant powers first manifest when she is in junior high school. An aspiring singer, she volunteers to perform at her school dance when her light-generating abilities first appear. Everyone at the dance assumes it is a technologically generated special effect, an assumption commonly made before she reveals herself to be a mutant later in her life.

===Becoming Dazzler===
Using the stage name &quot;Dazzler&quot;, Alison sets out to make a name for herself in the music industry, using her light powers and dancing ability to enhance her performances. It is at one of her shows that Alison first meets the X-Men while they are attacked by the forces of the Hellfire Club. Angry at the interruption of her show, Alison lashes out in anger at the Hellfire intruders, unintentionally making one member catatonic. Alison subsequently aids the X-Men in finding Kitty Pryde. She had always assumed that life as a disco queen would be exciting but finds the fight with the X-Men&#x27;s enemies going a bit too far, and turns down their offer to join the team.

Dazzler hid her status as a mutant from all but those closest to her. After acquainting herself with the various Marvel Comics superheroes, Alison finds herself continually using her abilities to fight both ordinary criminals and rogue superhumans—often at the expense of her career ambitions. On one occasion, she meets Spider-Man, teaming up against the Lightmaster. She later battled the Enchantress, is overwhelmed by Doctor Doom, the Absorbing Man and then fights off Nightmare. She briefly allied with the hero Blue Shield, and aids the X-Men and Spider-Woman against the misguided Caliban. On another occasion, she battles and defeats the Hulk, and establishes a long-standing feud with the then-mentally unstable Rogue. She fights against the cybernetic Techmaster. She also has a romantic affair with Warren Worthington III. In the course of her inadvertent adventures, she even encounters the planet-devouring Galactus, who initially thought she was of little import and generally ignores her. Nevertheless, Galactus temporarily endowed her with cosmic energy so she can retrieve the herald Terrax. Alison was also asked to audition for a place in the Avengers; she declined, saying that the superhero life was of no interest to her.

===Moving to Los Angeles===
Dazzler moved to Los Angeles in a fruitless attempt to help her half-sister Lois London, who has the mutant power to kill anyone with a touch, but has little to no control over the ability. While in Los Angeles, Alison attempts careers in fitness training, dancing, modeling, and acting. Influenced both by her lover Roman Nekoboh and her desire to abate the growing anti-mutant sentiment, Alison publicly declared her mutant identity soon afterwards. The revelation backfired, destroying her reputation and career and inflaming anti-mutant sentiment - also sending Alison into a depressive state. Forced into hiding, she spent some time as a keyboard player and back-up vocalist in fellow mutant singer Lila Cheney&#x27;s band.
 A covert anti-mutant army unit accidentally transformed one of its own members, a latent mutant named Zalme, into a creature called Dinosaur Man, who attacked Dazzler.

===Joining the X-Men===
While on tour, the band&#x27;s plane crashed and they were rescued by Cannonball and Joshua. Lila had been knocked out, so Dazzler used the music Joshua plays at the scene to blast a hole through the wreckage. She was later possessed by the psychic mutant Malice; after an encounter with the X-Men coming to warn her about the Marauders, Dazzler was freed from possession and became a member of the team. During her tenure with the X-Men, Dazzler received training, attains greater control over her powers, and develops a romance with the extra-dimensional Longshot. She was also forced to work alongside the now-reformed Rogue, which caused tension between them at first. Over time, Alison eventually found Rogue to be genuinely remorseful and forgave her teammate. Eventually she and her teammates in the X-Men enter the mystical Siege Perilous.

===Amnesia and Mojoworld===
Discovered in an amnesiac state washed up on a beach by her former bodyguard Guido, she was nursed back to health by Guido and Lila, though their efforts prove unsuccessful in helping restore her memory. Her memory was eventually restored when she was found by Longshot some time later. Devastated by the loss of her career in the interim, Alison ventured to Longshot&#x27;s native dimension Mojoworld, joining her lover and Lila in rebellion against the tyrant Mojo.

Alison&#x27;s life on Mojoworld was fraught; she suffered an apparent miscarriage and the apparent corruption of the X-Babies before returning to Earth without Longshot. Despite this, Dazzler helped Jean Grey fight against Magneto on Genosha. She and Jean lead a small band of mutants to back up Cyclops and Wolverine. She was apparently incinerated by Magneto, but was actually alive and well, having used a hard-light hologram of herself to distract Magneto while they recovered Professor X After returning to Westchester, the X-Men offered Alison help, but she declined and left the mansion.

Many years later, Shatterstar and Rictor encountered a past-version of Dazzler while time-traveling through Mojoworld. At this point in her life, Dazzler and Longshot were still married and active in the revolt against Mojo. Rictor discovered Dazzler just as she was about to give birth to the child that had been believed to result in a miscarriage. The surviving infant was revealed to be Shatterstar, resolving speculation that Shatterstar actually was the biological child of Dazzler and Longshot. Exhausted from her ordeal, Dazzler passed out, and Shatterstar revealed the necessity of wiping both her and Longshot&#x27;s memories of the event, and taking his infant self a century into Mojoworld&#x27;s future, to be raised as a warrior away from his birth parents.

===New Excalibur===
Dazzler later re-established her musical career by marketing her original, signature disco image as part of the Techno/Trance genre. Alison moved her career abroad to England and joined with X-Men allies such as the Juggernaut and Captain Britain. Later she was reunited with Longshot, although he was suffering from amnesia and did not remember her, though he later regained his feelings for her and some of his memories. Longshot left the Exiles to re-establish a relationship with Dazzler but they soon parted ways, due in part to Dazzler&#x27;s frustration with other women&#x27;s attraction to Longshot and the realization that Longshot is no longer the man she loved.

===Return to the X-Men===
Alison subsequently re-joined the X-Men in San Francisco while continuing her revived musical career. Later she took part in the fight against the Skrull invasion of Earth. After a night of drinking with team-mates Northstar and Pixie, Dazzler came under attack by the Sisterhood. In retaliation, she later accompanied Emma Frost, Storm and Karma in an attack on the Sisterhood in San Francisco, where she engaged a mind controlled Psylocke in battle. While Psylocke gained the upper hand, Dazzler absorbed all the sound from the city outside, which she turned into a beam of light that burnt the right side of Psylocke&#x27;s face off. After the Sisterhood retreated, Dazzler is happily reunited with Psylocke after she regained control.

Along with Gambit, Anole, Northstar, Cannonball, Pixie and Trance, Dazzler traveled to Limbo to rescue Magik. However, they were overwhelmed by the demons. She was rescued by Northstar but they come under attack from a possessed Gambit, who turns her into a state much like Gambit&#x27;s Death persona. They eventually infected the other X-Men in Limbo They were freed thanks to Magik&#x27;s Soulsword.

During the Schism between Cyclops and Wolverine, Dazzler chose to remain in San Francisco with Cyclops&#x27;s side. Dazzler was then asked to lead a &quot;Street Team&quot; of X-Men, to which she agreed. As a result, she worked alongside Boom Boom and Lifeguard.

Dazzler was later summoned to Utopia to help Cyclops and Danger with a Ghost Box; when opened it showed several alternate reality X-Men fighting an evil version of Professor X. She subsequently gets sucked through a portal and is whisked away from Earth-616, narrowly avoiding the conflict between the X-Men and the Avengers. She becomes team leader after Emmeline Frost opts to stay on a world where mutants are gods. Dazzler was later reunited with former teammate Sage when she tried to rescue a child version of Nightcrawler. Her leadership skills and abilities impressed both Cyclops and Wolverine, the latter of whom offered her a position at the Jean Grey School, believing she would be an invaluable resource to the students. Reluctant to accept the invitation after having spent a year traversing and saving the multiverse as well as witnessing the death of some of her friends, Dazzler opted instead to make a decision at a later time; Wolverine advises the offer still stands and to contact when she figures things out.

Instead, in an attempt to better understand the mutant community and Cyclops&#x27;s talk of mutant revolution, Maria Hill personally asked Dazzler to become an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., a proposition Alison accepts. However, soon after her first mission Dazzler was poisoned and replaced by the shapeshifter Mystique. Dazzler was later rescued by Magneto, and joined Cyclops&#x27;s Uncanny X-Men team.

===A-Force===
While participating in a roller derby in Miami, Dazzler was approached by Singularity, She-Hulk, Captain Marvel, Nico Minoru and Medusa to help them defeat Antimatter, since they required a powerful light source to defeat their foe. They attempted to negotiate with Antimatter but Dazzler was critically injured and died on the operating table. She woke up following the failed operation to realize it seemed like she was unable to die, and rejoined the fight against Antimatter in time to take Singularity into a pocket dimension to protect her from dying when Antimatter was destroyed. Singularity sensed something else had broken through into their universe; teleporting to Astoria, Oregon they found the dimension-hoppers were Dazzler Thor - an alternate version of Dazzler from Battleworld - and her opponent Countess. The Countess vanished following her defeat and A-Force took Dazzler Thor to get &quot;ale&quot; and Nico convinced Dazzler to talk to Dazzler Thor. Dazzler revealed to her alternate self that she had accidentally come into contact with Terrigen Mist and contracted M-Pox, which sterilizes and kills mutants. Dazzler woke up alongside the rest of A-Force and Dazzler Thor in a jail cell, without any powers. Nico appeared under the mind control and was made to send She-Hulk into a murderous rage, but they used this to escape. A-Force attacked the Countess; Dazzler Thor used a hologram to get close to the Countess, who attacked and injured her. Dazzler picked up Light Bringer to defend her but after the battle Dazzler Thor succumbed to the M-Pox virus and died in a flash of light. Dazzler revealed to the rest of A-Force she also had the lethal disease and left behind Light Bringer in respect for her fallen alternate self.

During the second superhero Civil War, Dazzler went with Captain Marvel to fight Thanos; She-Hulk was seriously injured in the fight. Shortly afterwards, Ulysses predicted that Nico would murder an innocent woman named Alice. Dazzler disagreed with Captain Marvel, who wanted to pre-emptively arrest her team-mate, and warned Nico when she arrived. Nico escaped, with Dazzler and Singularity opposing Captain Marvel and Medusa&#x27;s decision to hunt her down. They followed the pair to Arizona, where Nico is hiding with Elsa Bloodstone and find it overrun by an infection turning people into a swarm of giant bugs. After a brief confrontation when the rest of A-Force find Nico they split into two teams: one to find Alice and the other to protect the civilians. While searching for Alice in an abandoned mine, Danvers, Minoru and Bloodstone are attacked by a giant bug. The bug incapacitates Danvers and Bloodstone before telepathically communicating to Minoru that she is Alice and has been inadvertently infecting the townspeople after her transformation. Alice tells Minoru that killing her is the only way to save the people. When Minoru refuses, an infected Bloodstone threatens to kill Danvers. Medusa, Singularity, and an infected Dazzler are overrun by bugs and regroup with the others just as Bloodstone infects Danvers. After Dazzler infects Medusa, Minoru casts a spell to transform Alice back into a human but it does not cure the rest of the populace. Alice explains that she must be killed and Minoru reluctantly casts a death spell on Alice which transforms the infected back into humans. Alice then remerges in her final form and tells A-Force that she is no longer a threat as she now has greater control of her powers.

===Inhumans vs. X-Men===
During the war between the X-Men and the Inhumans, Dazzler assisted Emma Frost in the beginning of her plot to defeat the Inhumans, disguising herself as an Inhuman performer shortly before ambushing Black Bolt in his own Quiet Room.

===Residing on Krakoa===
Dazzler later becomes a citizen of Krakoa. After Krakoa is attacked by Orchis and leaves Earth for the White Hot Room, Dazzler returns to her career as a singer.

==Powers and abilities==
Dazzler is a mutant with the ability to transduce sonic vibrations which reach her body into various types of light. This ability seems to operate over a great range of frequencies, including the audible spectrum, and a great variation of sound pressure levels regardless of the complexity, dissonance, or randomness of the sound. Sounds as different as a car crash and a symphonic passage both produce convertible incoming acoustic vibrations. Dazzler prefers utilizing the sound of music, particularly that which is rhythmically sustained. Not only is music more pleasant to her ears, but the steady beat of contemporary music provides a more constant source of sound to convert. Dazzler has been shown to create a &quot;null space&quot; of sound in a certain radius of her person, as a result of &quot;pulling&quot; the sound in her area to her person, to either protect a crowd of people or to supercharge her power reserves.

Left undirected, Dazzler&#x27;s light will radiate from her body in all directions, producing regular flashes of white light. By conscious control over the light she produces, she can control its direction, frequency (color), amplitude (intensity), and duration. Her mutant ability can produce numerous other effects. She can create simple patterns out of rays of light or combinations of patterns which produce trance-like effects in her targets. She can create a pulse of light on the order of several thousand watts of power, which temporarily blinds people with its brilliance. She can create a cascade of sparkling lights and colors that severely upsets other people&#x27;s equilibrium, or a pulsating strobe-light effect. She can also radiate light in gentle, soothing patterns to calm a person&#x27;s mood. Dazzler can generate a coherent beam of light, approximating a laser beam, or generate a shield from laser energy that can deflect projectiles or energy beams. Dazzler has polarizing eyes and cannot be blinded or dazzled by light.

With effort, she can create holograms of human beings and other three-dimensional beings and objects. With similar effort she can also turn herself temporarily invisible and inaudible. She can also use light energy to generate some form of propulsion for flight or at least rapid ascent.

She generally directs lasers from a single finger when she requires precision. She most often uses her hands for directing her light effects, but she could also use other parts of her body. Since studying with the X-Men, she has become adept at directing her blinding strobe light blast from her eyes. The most powerful manifestation of her laser abilities is a concentrated stream of solid photons she usually fires from her index finger but can emit from her entire body. The beam is extremely powerful and as a consequence uses a great deal of her energy reserves. She has also demonstrated the ability to stretch the electromagnetic spectrum to produce devastating microwave energy. She has since learned how to produce these blasts without draining herself, while still providing them with considerable power.

Since the events of &quot;Dazzler: The Movie&quot;, Alison&#x27;s body can store sound energy for future discharge as light. Thanks to Professor X, Dazzler&#x27;s costume contains devices that enable her to store sonic energy more efficiently and to gauge and focus the light she generates with greater skill. She has also demonstrated on at least one occasion the ability to expel the stored sound into a devastating wave of sonic energy, that once destroyed her foe Silence. Dazzler is immune to the injurious effects of her light transducing abilities. Her ability to transduce sound also protects her from being deafened by loud sounds; In &quot;Dazzler&quot; vol. 2 #1, it was indicated that her ears are highly developed allowing her to detect sounds on frequencies that others cannot register. In &quot;X-Treme X-Men&quot; vol. 2 #4, she demonstrates the ability to use sound waves for echolocation before absorbing them for energy. Dazzler has also been shown to be immune to the powers of her half-sister Mortis, which ordinarily kills living subjects instantly. With considerable strain, Dazzler is capable of generating ultraviolet light in omnidirectional waves of such intensity that it will melt large metal structures.

Dazzler is a highly skilled athlete and hand-to-hand combatant thanks to her training with the X-Men and Gladiators, able to defeat over a dozen human combatants at once while purposely avoiding use of her mutant abilities. In addition, she is a talented singer, actress, and dancer. Dazzler is also a highly accomplished roller skater and can move at high speed; she is skilled enough to use her roller skates as weapons to strike an opponent&#x27;s solar plexus in a flying kick. Dazzler occasionally wears a pair of roller skates which magnetically adhere to her boots.

Characters in the Marvel Universe who are counted among her fans are Juggernaut, teammate Colossus, Hulk, Northstar, Rhino, Molly Hayes, Kitty Pryde, Moon Knight, Captain Marvel, and Pixie.

==Cultural impact and legacy==
===Critical reception===
Jerry Stanford of &quot;CBR.com&quot; referred to Dazzler as a &quot;compelling hero,&quot; writing, &quot;Dazzler has a fan following strong enough to keep a strong demand for her in the X-Men family of titles. Although her creation is mired in a failed cross-media event with a record company, her legacy in comics is achieving greatness despite her crass origins. Although much of her early adventures are trite, she went on to fame as one of the X-Men.&quot; Mike Avila of &quot;Syfy&quot; described Dazzler as &quot;one of Marvel’s most unique and even notorious characters,&quot; writing, &quot;After Dazzler headlined her own comic book series, Claremont further developed her as a member of the X-Men. She’s no longer quite as prevalent as she used to be, but Dazzler still has a devoted fan following 40 years after her debut.&quot; Chris Condry of &quot;Looper&quot; found Dazzler to be &quot;worthy of more film time and fandom,&quot; asserting, &quot;If Alison Blaire, aka Dazzler, were a real person, we daresay that she would be the most iconic woman on Earth. Blaire&#x27;s day job, or more accurately night job, is as a world-famous pop star... Essentially, Dazzler is what would happen if Lady Gaga spent her free time as John Wick.&quot; Bradley Prom of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; called Dazzler one of the characters who would be perfect for their own animated series.

Alex Welch of &quot;Inverse&quot; wrote, &quot;She’s basically what it would look like if a pop star was an actual superhero.&quot; George Marston of &quot;Newsarama&quot; stated, &quot;The fact is, Dazzler kicks ass. Her ability to turn sound into light has been expanded in creative and crafty ways time and time again, and her look has evolved from disco queen to aerobic video model, to an angst-inspired, darker look, and finally to her current style that combines elements of her previous looks with a modern twist.&quot; Marc Buxton| of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; asserted, &quot;Alison Blaire may have started out as somewhat of a joke, a way for Marvel to take advantage of the disco craze of the 70s, but she hasn’t remained that way. Instead, Dazzler has become one of the most beloved X-Men characters ever.&quot; In November 2005, during an interview with &quot;Newsarama&quot;, writer Brian K. Vaughan asserted, &quot;Ultimate Dazzler, on the other hand, may very well be Bendis&#x27; single greatest contribution to the free world, so I use her way too much.&quot;

===Impact===
Ira Madison III of &quot;MTV&quot; described Dazzler as a &quot;gay icon in the annals of Marvel legends,&quot; asserting, &quot;Dazzler remains a hugely popular character, particularly among queer Marvel fans. [...] Even though her stories were never tied to the disco scene at large, her journey of struggling for acceptance from a dismissive father and longing for the love of her missing mother was something that queer readers, who only years earlier could have been arrested for showing signs of affection toward a member of the same sex in public, connected with.&quot; Jerry Stanford of &quot;CBR.com&quot; asserted, &quot;Almost since the beginning, the story of mutants in the Marvel Universe has been an allegory for the civil rights of marginalized groups... Dazzler strives for unity and her words mirror things said in the LGBTQ community. Different groups sometimes seek to alienate others as not worthy of inclusion, and the fight here makes a stand for a big tent movement.&quot; Andrew Wheeler of &quot;ComicsAlliance&quot; stated, &quot;Ideas of self-ownership occur again and again in Claremont&#x27;s stories and characters... Dazzler is mutantdom&#x27;s first drag performer, using stage theatrics to present her true self to the world. On the stage she could embrace her mutant identity in a way that wouldn&#x27;t feel safe on the street.&quot;

Brian Andersen of &quot;The Advocate&quot; said, &quot;Dazzler isn’t queer. But being the premier superhero pop singer in the Marvel Universe means a strong argument can be made that she’s a gay icon.&quot; Hayden Manders of &quot;Nylon&quot; wrote, &quot;All socio-political commentary aside, superhero narratives are filled with strong female characters, which we know makes up a huge percentage of queer icons. Characters like Wonder Woman, Storm, Dazzler, Captain Marvel, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer are fierce and independent, capable of kicking just as much (if not more!) ass as their male counterparts. [...] That sort of representation is vital to the queer experience; it helps normalize what the world often sees as abnormal. Their superpowers only add another element of fearlessness to the community, because to be queer is to have superpowers.&quot;

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; reality, Dazzler appears as a member of the X-Men. She is a chain smoker, having no use for a singing voice in this timeline.

With this new power-set, Dazzler serves as a one-woman training facility, as well as a messenger via holographic transmissions. She was romantically involved with Exodus.

Dazzler was one of the characters involved in the original Age of Apocalypse to be brought back for the &quot;Age of Apocalypse 10th Anniversary&quot; miniseries.

===House of M===
In the House of M reality, Dazzler is one of the most famous mutants on Earth. After having a successful singing career as a teenager, Dazzler continued her career as the world&#x27;s primary media personality via her syndicated talk show. The &quot;House of M&quot; newsprint special featured a tabloid-esque blind article, indicating that Alison&#x27;s signature lightshow was fading due to a rare blood disorder, which was causing her to lose her mutation. Storm used Alison&#x27;s popular talk show to sound off on her disapproval of Magneto&#x27;s handling of mutant affairs and Mister Sinister was seen watching the Alison show when Deadpool went to rescue an infant Cable.

===Marvel Zombies===
In the &quot;Marvel Zombies&quot; universe, Dazzler appears as one of the few uninfected heroes in the limited series &quot;Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness&quot;. There, she is almost eaten by an infected Winter Soldier until he is killed by Ash Williams. Ash is attracted to Dazzler, but she does not reciprocate his feelings. As a thanks for saving her, Dazzler agrees to help Ash find the Necronomicon book that might put an end to the zombies.

She briefly joins Emma Frost&#x27;s Academy of Tomorrow when promised a record deal, but joins the X-Men after they rescue her from a Sentinel attack. There she is called &quot;Dazzler&quot; after the name of her band.

She often shows a lack of enthusiasm for the X-Men and their endeavors, but after learning of a proposed public execution of a mutant, she convinces a group of teammates to go on a rescue mission. When the mission goes astray and Angel is captured, Dazzler takes initiative and leads the team in a recovery operation. This leads to the accidental release of Longshot.

Later, she and Angel go out on a presumed &#x27;date&#x27; (really an effort to get themselves involved with the X-Men&#x27;s latest mission) preventing the &quot;Academy of Tomorrow&quot; students from attacking the Triskelion. During the incident, power is lost and one of the inmates, Deathstrike, impales Dazzler through the chest. Ironically, Deathstrike is defeated by the very killer Dazzler has assisted before.

Dazzler stays in a coma for several weeks, visited many times by Nightcrawler having an unrequited crush on her. Unfortunately, many factors have combined to unhinge Nightcrawler and as soon as she is able to be moved, she is fooled into thinking they must escape. Initially trusting Nightcrawler, she cooperates until the rest of the X-Men rescue her. The others, understanding Nightcrawler is mentally ill, plan to rehabilitate. Dazzler does not accept this and quits the team in protest.

She has since been labeled as one of the &quot;most important&quot; mutants to the X-Men&#x27;s cause by the future Bishop. Dazzler later joins Bishop&#x27;s new team in &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; #82. When Bishop dies in &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; #90, Dazzler returned to the Xavier Institute to be with Angel and on Xavier&#x27;s X-Men team once again. She is seen to be on Colossus&#x27;s enhanced team, using the drug Banshee to boost her powers. The drug-enhanced team battles Xavier&#x27;s main X-Men and eventually leave their drug-filled lives and return to the X-Mansion. When Magneto&#x27;s worldwide devastation hits the X-Men, Dazzler is revealed by Jean Grey to have been killed in the tidal wave along with teammates Beast and Nightcrawler.

The Ultimate iteration of Dazzler does not convert sound into light in this continuity. Her powers are defined as &quot;Matter Detonation&quot;; by detonating small particles in the air, she is able to create brilliant photokinetic effects, controlling the color and intensity of the light created. Under the influence of the drug Banshee, Dazzler&#x27;s powers are vastly increased, and she is able to create solid light constructs such as a sword, a tiger for her to ride into battle, and even a copy of Wolverine&#x27;s claws, which she uses to fight Wolverine. Dazzler&#x27;s true powers are shown when she detonates the matter making up Sentinel robots, completely destroying them with her sheer power.

===X-Babies===
A member of the X-Babies is based on Dazzler.

===X-Men: The End===
In &quot;X-Men: The End&quot;, a series about the X-Men&#x27;s hypothetical future, Dazzler continued her career as a singer. An occasional &quot;reserve&quot; team member, she joined Storm and X-Men members Iceman, Bishop, Psylocke, and Sage for Xavier&#x27;s &quot;Plan B&quot; team. Co-piloting a ship to the extraterrestrial Shi&#x27;ar homeworld, Dazzler used her powers to create a light show, calming the passions of the battling X-Men and Shi&#x27;ar Imperial Guard. Cassandra Nova then manifests, slaying the Imperial Guard and leaving the remaining X-Men as her sole adversaries. Dazzler attempted to subdue Cassandra along with Storm and Iceman. While she uses her ability to laser a hole through Cassandra&#x27;s head, Storm strikes her with lightning, giving Iceman a chance to freeze her. Bishop then shatters her to prevent her from returning. However, Cassandra simply reforms and, as a form of retaliation, blasts a hole through Dazzler, strikes Storm with energy, and freezes Iceman. She successfully killed Storm and Dazzler, but Iceman survived the ordeal. Dazzler is believed to be among the slain X-Men that were invited to a plane of higher existence by the Phoenix.

===What If===
Dazzler was featured in two issues of &quot;What If&quot;:

* In &quot;What If&quot; #33 (June 1982), Dazzler decides to stay Galactus&#x27; herald after she defeats Terrax. After many years of servitude during which she guides Galactus to feed on uninhabited worlds to spare the lives of beings on other planets, she is free to return to Earth. When she arrives, Dazzler discovers the Earth had become a barren wasteland. With nowhere else to go, she returns to Galactus who welcomes her return.
* In a two-part What If? story (What if Cable had destroyed the X-Men? and What if Magneto took over the U.S.?) based on &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #269, Dazzler is an agent of Magneto. She is ultimately killed by a Sentinel warhead.

<text>Lincoln Park is a designated community area on the North Side of Chicago, Illinois. It is located west of Lincoln Park.

== History ==
In 1824, the United States Army built a small post near today&#x27;s Clybourn Avenue and Armitage Avenue (formerly Centre Street). Native American settlements existed along Green Bay Trail, now called Clark Street (named after George Rogers Clark), at the current intersection of Halsted Street and Fullerton Avenue. Before Green Bay Trail became Clark Street, it stretched as far as Green Bay, Wisconsin, including Sheridan Road, and was part of what still is Green Bay Road in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin.

In 1836, land from North to Fullerton and from the lake to Halsted was relatively inexpensive, costing (1836 prices, not adjusted for inflation). Because the area was considered remote, a smallpox hospital and the city cemetery were located in Lincoln Park until the 1860s.

In 1837, Chicago was incorporated as a city, and North Avenue (to the south of today&#x27;s Lincoln Park neighborhood) was established as the city&#x27;s northern boundary. Settlements increased along Green Bay Trail when the government offered land claims and Green Bay Road was widened. The area north of Chicago, including today&#x27;s Lincoln Park, was eventually incorporated as Lake View Township. The city, nonetheless, owned extensive tracts of land north of North Avenue, including what is now the park. The Township was annexed to Chicago in 1889. The Lincoln Park Zoo opened in 1868.

In the period following the Civil War, the area around Southport and Clybourn became home to a community of Kashubian immigrants. Arriving from what is now north-eastern Poland, Chicago&#x27;s Kashubians brought their own distinct culture and language, influenced by their rustic traditions. In 1882, St. Josaphat&#x27;s Roman Catholic parish was established specifically for the Kashubian community. The resulting nicknames of &quot;Jozafatowo&quot; (Polish for &quot;Josaphat&#x27;s Town&quot;) as well as &quot;Kaszubowo&quot; (Polish for &quot;Cassubian Town&quot;) made the neighborhood one of Chicago&#x27;s Polish Patches. The current Romanesque Revival church building was completed in 1902. A Pomeranian Griffin Crest visible on the school south of the church is a nod to the parish that once anchored one of the communities in Chicago dubbed &quot;Little Cassubia.&quot;

From 1896 to 1903, the original Ferris Wheel was located at a small amusement park near Clark St. and Wrightwood Ave. The site was from 2619 to 2665 N. Clark St., which is now the location of a McDonald&#x27;s and a high-rise residential building. On February 14, 1929, seven mob associates and a mechanic were shot to death in an automobile garage at 2122 N. Clark St.

During the Great Depression, many buildings in Lincoln Park fell into disrepair. In 1954 the Lincoln Park Conservation Association was founded to prevent deterioration of housing in the neighborhood and by 1956 Lincoln Park received urban renewal funds to renovate and restore old buildings and schools.

In 1968, a violent confrontation between demonstrators and police in Lincoln Park occurred during the week of the 1968 Democratic National Convention.

In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, Lincoln Park became home to the first Puerto Rican immigrants to Chicago. Jose Cha Cha Jimenez transformed the local Young Lords gang into human rights activists for Latinos and the poor. They published newspapers, mounted sit-ins and takeovers of institutions and churches at Grant Hospital, Armitage Ave. Methodist Church, and McCormick Theological Seminary.
In 1969, members of the Puerto Rican Young Lords and residents and activists mounted gigantic demonstrations and protested the displacement of Puerto Ricans and the poor including the demolition of buildings on the corner of Halsted and Armitage streets, by occupying the space and some administration buildings at McCormick Theological Seminary. There were civil rights arrests and martyrs including the unsolved murders of United Methodist Rev. Bruce Johnson and his wife Eugenia Ransier Johnson who were strong supporters of the poor. Today their history is archived at DePaul University&#x27;s Richardson Library and at Special Collections at Grand Valley State University.

On June 29, 2003, a porch collapse occurred during a party at 713 W. Wrightwood Ave. The disaster was the deadliest porch collapse in U.S. history; 13 people were killed and 57 seriously injured.

As of 2015, the neighborhood is primarily made up of young urban professionals, recent college graduates, and young families. The slang terms Trixie and Chad have their origins in Lincoln Park.

==Community area==

Lincoln Park&#x27;s boundaries are precisely defined in the city&#x27;s list of official community areas. It is bordered on the north by Diversey Parkway, on the west by the Chicago River, on the south by North Avenue, and on the east by Lake Michigan.

It encompasses a number of neighborhoods, including Lincoln Central, Mid-North, Old Town Triangle, Park West, RANCH Triangle, Sheffield, and Wrightwood Neighbors. The area also includes most of the Clybourn Corridor retail district, which continues into the Near North Side. Lincoln Park neighborhood associations include: Lincoln Central Association, Mid-North Association, Old Town Triangle Association, Park West Community Association, RANCH Triangle Community Conservation Association, Sheffield Neighborhood Association, and Wrightwood Neighbors Association. All are affiliated with the Lincoln Park Conservation Association.

Lincoln Park is home to Lincoln Park High School, Francis W. Parker School, and DePaul University. Many students who attend these schools now live in this neighborhood. Lincoln Park is also home to five architecturally significant churches: St. Vincent de Paul Parish, St. Clement Church, St. Josaphat&#x27;s (one of the many so-called &#x27;Polish Cathedrals&#x27; in Chicago), St. James Lutheran Church and St. Michael&#x27;s Church in the Old Town Triangle area of Lincoln Park. Visible from throughout the neighborhood, these monumental edifices tower over the neighborhood, lending the area much of its charm. Five Lincoln Park churches are affiliated with the Catholic Church (St. Bonaventure Oratory, Saint Clement Church, St. Michael in Old Town, St. Teresa de Avila Catholic Parish, St. Vincent de Paul Parish). The neighborhood also houses Children&#x27;s Memorial Hospital (recently moved to Streeterville and was renamed Ann &amp; Robert H. Lurie Children&#x27;s Hospital of Chicago) and the currently closed Lincoln Park Hospital (formerly known as Grant Hospital and before that German-American Hospital). In 2019 the land was redeveloped as a mixed use property including condominiums two multi-family towers a slew of retailers and commercial space called &quot;Lincoln Common.&quot;

The neighborhood contains a large number of upscale national retailers, boutiques, bookstores, restaurants and coffee shops. There are also many bars and clubs in the area.

A. Finkl &amp; Sons Steel operated on the west side of Lincoln park along an approximately 22-acre lot by the Chicago River for 113 years. The site is now vacant and is the site of the proposed Lincoln Yards project.

Lincoln Park is one of the wealthiest and most expensive communities in which to live. While the average single-family house is priced around $1 million, many homes in the area sell for more than $10 million. In 2007, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine named the area between Armitage Avenue, Willow Street, Burling Street, and Orchard Street as the most expensive block in Chicago.

==Namesake park==
Lincoln Park, for which the neighborhood was named, now stretches miles past the neighborhood of Lincoln Park.

The YMCA opened the New City YMCA in 1981. The YMCA&#x27;s clientele included people in Lincoln Park and in Cabrini-Green. As the YMCA was located in the latter, it was built windowless so it would not suffer from stray bullets, a product of crime in that neighborhood. CBS Chicago 2 stated that the facility was &quot;once credited with breaking down a barrier between families from&quot; different socioeconomic communities. In 2007, the YMCA closed, with the land sold, as Cabrini Green&#x27;s impoverished community moved away. The YMCA shifted its focus and planned to open a new facility in Kelly Hall of the Mission of Our Lady of the Angels in Humboldt Park.

<doc id="421989" wikidata="Q3026391" url="?curid=421989" title="Quebec diaspora">
<text>The Quebec diaspora consists of Quebec immigrants and their descendants dispersed over the North American continent and historically concentrated in the New England region of the United States, Ontario, and the Canadian Prairies. The mass emigration out of Quebec occurred in the period between 1840 and the Great Depression of the 1930s.

== United States ==

Approximately 900,000 Quebec residents (French Canadian for the great majority) left for the United States between 1840 and 1930. They were pushed to emigrate by overpopulation in rural areas that could not sustain them under the seigneurial system of land tenure, but also because the expansion of this system was in effect blocked by the &quot;Château Clique&quot; that ruled Quebec under the British administration, who reserved new land developments for the English and the English system of colonization (see Eastern Townships). New England was the preferred destination due to its growing industrialization. About half of the emigrants are reported to have eventually returned to Canada. Often those who stayed organized themselves in communities sometimes known as Little Canadas. A great proportion of Americans of French ancestry trace it through Quebec. Others, particularly in the South, were from Acadia—the Cajuns—and from France directly. Until 1849, the Catholic Church was not allowed to purchase any land or establish any parishes in the Eastern Townships due to English Protestant laws and control. At the initiative of Father Bernard O&#x27;Reilley, an &quot;Association des Townships&quot; was set up in 1848 to promote settlement in the area. In the 1850s, the association purchased lands which it gave to young families of farmers to prevent them from leaving for the United States where it was believed they would ultimately be assimilated.

Certain early American centres of textile manufacturing and other industries attracted significant French-Canadian populations, like Lewiston and other bordering counties in Maine; Fall River, Holyoke, Fitchburg, and Lowell in Massachusetts; Woonsocket in Rhode Island; Manchester in New Hampshire and the bordering counties in Vermont. There was a significant number of French Canadians who moved to the Kankakee, Illinois area from the 1830s through the 1870s, including religious missionaries, establishing communities such as Bourbonnais, St. Anne, St. Georges, Papineau, and L&#x27;Erable. There are also sizeable populations of French-Canadian descent in Michigan and Minnesota—who began migrating there when the region was still part of New France.

The Museum of Work and Culture in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, details New England&#x27;s Quebec diaspora which developed in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

Noteworthy among those whose parents settled in the United States are writer Jack Kerouac, baseball player Nap Lajoie, politician Mike Gravel, singers Rudy Vallée and Robert Goulet, Emil Beaulieau, historian Will Durant, and many more.

== Ontario ==

The largest proportion of French-Canadians outside Quebec trace their ancestry to Quebec (except in the Canadian Maritimes, which were settled by the Acadians). Ontario had been part of New France and settlements in the Detroit-Windsor area find their origins in that period.

The development of mining and forestry resources in the northeastern and eastern regions of Ontario at the end of the 19th century and early 20th century attracted a large workforce from Quebec. A great part of today&#x27;s half a million Franco-Ontarians are the descendants of these Quebec emigrants. The Francophone population of Ontario is today still concentrated mainly in the northeastern and eastern parts of Ontario, close to the border with Quebec, although smaller pockets of Francophone settlement exist throughout the province in areas like Windsor, Welland and Penetanguishene.

== Canadian West ==

While a good number of emigrants were from Quebec or Ontario, it is often Franco-Americans who formed the nucleus of the population in several francophone communities of Western Canada. These populations today self-identify with their province of residence (Franco-Manitobans, Fransaskois, Franco-Albertans or Franco-Columbians).

It was introduced in 1999 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Hank Aaron&#x27;s surpassing of Babe Ruth&#x27;s career home run mark of 714 home runs. The award was the first major award to be introduced by Major League Baseball in 19 years.

For the 1999 season, a winner was selected using an objective points system. Hits, home runs, and runs batted in (RBI) were given certain point values and the winner was the player who had the highest tabulated points total.

In 2000, the system was changed to a ballot in which each MLB team&#x27;s radio and television play-by-play broadcasters and color analysts voted for three players in each league. Their first-place vote receives five points, the second-place vote receives three points, and the third-place vote receives one point. Beginning in 2003, fans were allowed to vote via MLB&#x27;s official website, MLB.com. Fans&#x27; votes account for 30% of the points, while broadcasters&#x27; and analysts&#x27; votes account for the other 70%.

The award is handed out to the winners of both leagues before Game 4 of the World Series (mostly after Game 2 due to travel to a different venue) each year, with Aaron himself presenting the awards until the 2019 World Series and his death in 2021 (except 2018 when it is handed out in Game 3 and 2019 when it is handed out in Game 2). The first winners of the award were Manny Ramirez and Sammy Sosa in 1999, while the most recent winners are Aaron Judge and Shohei Ohtani. Alex Rodriguez won the award four times, the most of any player. Ohtani is the first player to win the award in both leagues. The winner with the most hits was Ronald Acuña Jr. in 2023, Barry Bonds in 2001 had the most home runs, and Manny Ramírez in 1999 had the most RBIs. Players from the Boston Red Sox and Toronto Blue Jays have won the award five times, the most of any team.

==Trophy==
The Hank Aaron Award has a maritaca granite base and an antique bat and banner combination on the top. It weighs and sits on a base of cherry wood.

==Multiple-time winners==
15 players have won the award multiple times, with Alex Rodriguez (4 awards) and Barry Bonds (3 awards) being the only players to win more than twice. Shohei Ohtani is the only player to win in both the American and National League. David Ortiz won two awards 11 years apart (2005 and 2016), the largest gap of any player.

<text>The cinema of Taiwan or Taiwan cinema ( or ) is deeply rooted in the island&#x27;s unique history. Since its introduction to Taiwan in 1901 under Japanese rule, cinema has developed in Taiwan under ROC rule through several distinct stages, including &quot;taiyu pian&quot; (Taiwanese film) of the 1950s and 1960s, genre films of the 1960s and 1970s, including &quot;jiankang xieshi pian&quot; (healthy realist film), &quot;wuxia pian&quot; (sword-fighting film), &quot;aiqing wenyi pian&quot; (literary romantic film), &quot;zhengxuan pian&quot; (political propaganda film), and &quot;shehui xieshi pian&quot; (social realist film), Taiwan New Cinema of the 1980s, and the new wave of the 1990s and afterwards. Starting in the second decade of the new millennium, documentary films also became a representative part of Taiwan cinema. 

==Characteristics==

===Taiwanese directors===
Taiwan cinema is internationally known for its representative directors, including King Hu (Chinese: 胡金銓), Hou Hsiao-hsien (Chinese: 侯孝賢), Edward Yang (Chinese 楊德昌), Tsai Ming-liang (Chinese 蔡明亮), Chang Tso Chi (Chinese: 張作驥), Chung Mong-Hong (Chinese: 鍾孟宏), and Midi Zhao (Chinese: 趙德胤).

===Influence of the government===
From the late Japanese colonial period to martial law in Taiwan, the development of Taiwanese film was dominated by the official camp studio development. The film produced during that stage was mainly news footage taken by the government-run studio (Taiwan film companies, the Central Motion Picture Corporation, China Film Studio) and political propaganda. Even today, the Taiwanese government maintains a &quot;Film Fund&quot; to financially support the film industry of the country. The fund is somewhat controversial yet is still well supported.

The Government Information Office (Chinese: 新聞局) was in charge of the film grant before 2012. Grants were divided into two groups of $5 million and $800 million. The production cost works out to be around a minimum of $120 million across 15 films. The application contains certain specifications to allow the correct amount of money to be allocated to a given film&#x27;s production, for example the purpose of the $5 million grant is to encourage new directors directing a feature film for the first time.

The Ministry of Culture (Chinese: 文化部) is in charge of film policy and film industry since 2012.

===Documentaries===
After the documentary about Taiwan&#x27;s traumatic earthquake in 1999 &quot;Life&quot; (生命, 2004) garnered then record-high 30,000,000NT at the box office, documentary films from Taiwan have also become more popular. The development of Taiwanese documentaries began after lifting of martial law in 1987 and the rise in popularity of small electronic camcorders, as well as the support and promotion provided by the Taiwan Council for Cultural Affairs. Documentaries also receive support from other government agencies and private corporations. A variety of film festivals and awards have been established to encourage the production of documentaries.

Taiwanese documentaries often deal with themes related to the filmmaker or their family, and explore serious social or political issues. These documentaries have started to gain international attention gradually, and many have gone on to win awards at international film festivals.

==Early cinema, 1900–1945==
The first film was introduced into Taiwan by Toyojirō Takamatsu (; see 高松豐次郎) in 1901. Taiwanese cinema was the first, and from 1900 to 1937, one of the most important of Japan&#x27;s colonial film markets during the era of Japanese rule. In 1905, Takamatsu raised 10,000 Japanese yen in donations to the Japanese military from the proceeds of films screened in Taiwan about the Russo-Japanese War. By 1910, the Taiwan Colonial Government coordinated the efforts of independent filmmakers such as Takamatsu and others to establish a more organized approach to the production of film in the colony of Taiwan. Films played a vital role in enabling the larger colonial project of imperialization or cultural assimilation of Taiwanese subjects into the Japanese empire. The first silent film produced in Taiwan was &quot;An Introduction to the Actual Condition of Taiwan&quot;, a propaganda documentary that Takamatsu directed in 1907. Takamatsu noted that early films were produced mostly for Japanese audiences rather than for local Taiwanese. Hence, early films tended to be educational in nature, lauding Japan&#x27;s modernizing presence on the island. Other films catered to Japanese audiences exotic desires for Taiwan as a place of adventure and danger such as &quot;Conquering Taiwan&#x27;s Native Rebels&quot; (1910) and &quot;Heroes of the Taiwan Extermination Squad&quot; (1910).

Many conventions in Japanese films were adopted by the Taiwanese filmmakers. For example, the use of a &quot;benshi&quot; (narrator of silent films), which was a very important component of the film-going experience in Japan, was adopted and renamed &quot;piān-sū&quot; by the Taiwanese. This narrator was very different from its equivalent in the Western world. It rapidly evolved into a star system but one based on the Japanese system. In fact, people would go to see the very same film narrated by different benshi, to hear the other benshi&#x27;s interpretation. A romance could become a comedy or a drama, depending on the narrator&#x27;s style and skills. Lu, a famous actor and benshi in Taiwan wrote the best reference book on Taiwanese cinema. The first Taiwanese benshi master was a musician and composer named Wang Yung-feng, who had played on a regular basis for the orchestra at the Fang Nai Ting Theatre in Taipei. He was also the composer of the music for the Chinese film &quot;Tao hua qi xue ji&quot; (China, Peach girl, 1921) in Shanghai. Other famous Taiwanese benshi masters were Lu Su-Shang and Zhan Tian-Ma. Lu Su-shang, is not primarily remembered for his benshi performances, but mainly for writing the inestimable history of cinema and drama in Taiwan. The most famous benshi of all was possibly Zhan Tian-ma, whose story is told in a recent Taiwanese biographical film, March of Happiness (Taiwan, 1999, dir: Lin Sheng-shing). Benshi masters frequently were intellectuals: many spoke Japanese, often traveled to Japan and/or China, and some were poets who wrote their own librettos for each film. From 1910, films started to be distributed with a script, but the benshi often preferred to continue with their own interpretations. Notable films during this period include &quot;Song of Sadness&quot; (, 1919), &quot;The Eyes of Buddha&quot; (, 1922), and &quot;Whose Mistake?&quot; (, 1925).

Unlike Japanese-occupied Manchuria, Taiwan never became an important production market for Japan but rather was a vital exhibition market. Japanese-produced newsreels, shorts, educational, and feature films were widely circulated throughout Taiwan from the mid-1920s through 1945 and even after decolonization. As in Japan&#x27;s other colonial film markets, the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937 marked the beginning of an era of enhanced mobilization for the Japanese war effort throughout Asia and Taiwan&#x27;s film markets were purged of American and Chinese films as a result. The Japanese strove to transform the locals into Japanese citizens, giving them Japanese names, a Japanese education, encouraging them to wear Japanese clothes and the men to cut their long hair. Films such as &quot;Japanese Police Supervise a Taiwanese Village&quot; (1935) illustrated how &quot;proper&quot; imperial subjects should dress and act as well as promoting their superior farming skills thanks to the Japanese overlords. Taiwanese directors would vividly revisit the legacy of this process of cultural annexation in such films as Hou Hsiao-hsien&#x27;s &quot;City of Sadness&quot; (1989) and &quot;The Puppetmaster&quot; (1993), as well as Wu Nien-jen&#x27;s &quot;A Borrowed Life&quot; (1994).

==After 1949==
Taiwanese cinema grew again after 1949, when the end of the Chinese civil war brought many filmmakers sympathetic to the Nationalists to Taiwan. Even then, the majority of films were still made in Taiwanese Hokkien and this continued for many years, with over a thousand Taiwanese-language films being made from 1956 to 1981. In 1962, out of a total of 120 films produced, only seven were made in Mandarin; the rest were made in Taiwanese. However, the production of films in Taiwanese began to decline due to a variety of reasons, ranging from limited scope and waning interest for such films, to the Nationalist government&#x27;s promotion of Standard Chinese in mass media and its deeming of Taiwanese as too &quot;coarse&quot;. In 1969, more films were produced in Mandarin than in Taiwanese in the country for the first time. The last movie filmed entirely in Taiwanese was made in 1981.

The 1960s marked the beginning of Taiwan&#x27;s rapid modernization. The government focused strongly on the economy, industrial development, and education, and in 1963 the Central Motion Picture Corporation (CMPC; see 中影公司) introduced the &quot;Health Realism&quot; melodrama. This film genre was proposed to help build traditional moral values, which were deemed important during the rapid transformation of the nation&#x27;s socioeconomic structure. During this time, traditional kung fu films as well as romantic melodramas were also quite popular. The author Chiung Yao is especially famous for the movies made in this time period which were based on her widely read romantic novels.

Taiwanese cinema of this period is related to censorship in the Republic of China and propaganda in the Republic of China.

==New Taiwanese Cinema, 1982–1990==

By the early 1980s, the popularity of home video made film-watching a widespread activity for the Taiwanese. However, the Taiwanese film industry faced serious challenges, including the entry of Hong Kong films into the Taiwanese market. In order to compete with Hong Kong films, the CMPC began an initiative to support several fresh, young directors. In 1982, the film &quot;In Our Time&quot; (1982), which featured four young talented directors (Edward Yang, Te-Chen Tao, I-Chen Ko, and Yi Chang), began what would be known as the rejuvenation of Taiwanese cinema: the New Taiwanese Cinema.

In contrast to the melodrama or kung-fu action films of the earlier decades, New Taiwanese Cinema films are known for their realistic, down-to-earth, and sympathetic portrayals of Taiwanese life. These films sought to portray genuine stories of people living either in urban or rural Taiwan, and are often compared stylistically to the films of the Italian neorealism movement. This emphasis on realism was further enhanced by innovative narrative techniques. For example, the conventional narrative structure which builds the drama to a climax was abandoned and the story progressed at the pace as it would in real life.

Due to its honest portrayal of life, New Taiwanese Cinema films examined many of the important issues facing Taiwanese society at the time, such as urbanization, the struggle against poverty, and conflicts with political authority. For instance, Hou Hsiao-hsien&#x27;s &quot;A City of Sadness&quot; portrays the tensions and the conflicts between the local Taiwanese and the newly arrived Chinese Nationalist government after the end of the Japanese occupation. Chen Kunhou&#x27;s 1983 film &quot;Growing Up&quot; provides a nuanced perspective on the experience of a very young boy, from an ordinary family, getting into progressively more trouble. Edward Yang&#x27;s &quot;Taipei Story&quot; (1985) and &quot;A Confucian Confusion&quot; (1994) talk about the confusion of traditional values and modern materialism among young urbanites in the 1980s and 1990s. His nearly four-hour film &quot;A Brighter Summer Day&quot; (1991), considered by many to be his masterpiece and the defining work of the New Taiwanese Cinema, deals with Taiwan&#x27;s struggle in the 1960s to find its identity after the Kuomintang took control of Taiwan and brought numerous Chinese immigrants to the new republic, who expected to return to China once the Communists had been defeated. The New Taiwanese Cinema films therefore create a fascinating chronicle of Taiwan&#x27;s socio-economic and political transformation in modern times.

==Second New Wave, 1990–2010==

The New Taiwanese Cinema gradually gave way to what could be informally called the Second New Wave, which are slightly less serious and more amenable to the populace, although just as committed to portraying the Taiwanese perspective.

For example, Tsai Ming-liang&#x27;s &quot;Vive L&#x27;Amour&quot;, which won the Golden Lion at the 1994 Venice Film Festival, portrays the isolation, despair, and love of young adults living in the upscale apartments of Taipei. Stan Lai&#x27;s &quot;The Peach Blossom Land&quot; (1992) is a tragi-comedy involving two groups of actors rehearsing different plays on the same stage; the masterful juxtaposition and the depth of the play&#x27;s political and psychological meanings helped it win recognition at festivals in Tokyo and Berlin.

Ang Lee is perhaps the most well-known of the Second New Wave directors. His early films &quot;Pushing Hands&quot; (1991), &quot;The Wedding Banquet&quot; (1993), and &quot;Eat Drink Man Woman&quot; (1994) focus on the generational and cultural conflicts confronting many modern families. His &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; (2000) revived the wuxia genre successfully. Although not in the tradition of New Wave or Second New Wave, it is a commercial success which placed Asian films firmly in the international domain. The recent films &quot;Eternal Summer&quot; (2006), &quot;Prince of Tears&quot; (2009) and &quot;Winds of September&quot; (2009) have pushed the boundaries of Taiwanese film-making and broken the island&#x27;s long-standing taboos about the depiction of controversial subject matter.

Taiwanese cinema faced difficult times competing with Hollywood blockbusters in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Box office for local films dwindled to less than 20 films annually and many Taiwanese viewers preferred watching Hong Kong or Hollywood productions, causing the country&#x27;s film industry to be dominated by foreign repertoire. Taiwan&#x27;s film industry went into decline in 1994 and collapsed in 1997 because of the growing popularity of movie piracy. The high box office takings of &quot;Cape No. 7&quot; (2008) by Wei Te-sheng and Taiwanese films after 2008 proved that the local film industry had recovered from its slump. &quot;Cape No. 7&quot; was so popular in Taiwan that on 1 November 2008 it became its highest grossing domestic film, second in the country&#x27;s cinematic history to &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997). It raked in 530 million TWD (US$17.9 million) domestically, setting an all-time box office record for a Taiwanese film, and is currently the highest grossing Taiwanese domestic film of all time. It has won 15 awards to date, such as &quot;The Outstanding Taiwanese Film of the Year&quot; at the 45th Golden Horse Awards in 2008.

==Revival, 2010–present==
After the success of &quot;Cape No. 7&quot;, the Taiwanese movie industry began to recover from a slump that had lasted for about 10 years. Some notable films that led the revival of Taiwanese cinema are &quot;Secret&quot; (2007), &quot;Taipei Exchanges&quot; (2010), &quot;Monga&quot; (2010), &quot;Seven Days in Heaven&quot; (2010), &quot;Night Market Hero&quot; (2011), &quot;Love&quot; (2012). The head of the Government Information Office stated that &quot;2011 will be a brand new year and a new start for Taiwanese films&quot;.
 The director of &quot;Cape No. 7&quot;, Wei Te-sheng&#x27;s follow-up movie, &quot;Seediq Bale&quot; (comprising a part 1 and part 2) was released in September 2011, with part 1 (The Sun Flag) being the 2nd highest grossing Taiwanese domestic film of all time and part 2 (The Rainbow Bridge) being the 7th highest grossing Taiwanese domestic film of all time.
 It was shown in competition at the 68th Venice International Film Festival and it was selected as a contender for nomination for the 84th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film in 2011 and was one of nine films shortlisted to advance to the next round of voting for nomination.
Other notable films include: &quot;The Killer Who Never Kills&quot; (2011), which is based on a short story in the &quot;Killer&quot; series written by Giddens Ko. Additionally, the popular 2009 TV series &quot;Black &amp; White&quot; resulted in two feature films entitled: &quot;Black &amp; White Episode I: The Dawn of Assault&quot; (2012) (a prequel to the TV series) and &quot;Black &amp; White: The Dawn of Justice&quot; (2014) (another prequel to the TV series but a sequel to the 2012 film). In 2012, Giddens Ko&#x27;s romance &quot;You Are the Apple of My Eye&quot; (2012) earned about NTD 425 million, making it the 4th highest grossing domestic Taiwanese film of all time, followed by Fung Kai&#x27;s &quot;Din Tao: Leader of the Parade&quot; (2012) which earned NTD 317 million, making it the 8th highest grossing domestic Taiwanese film of all time. In 2013, Chiu Li-kwan&#x27;s film &quot;David Loman&quot; (2013) earned NTD 428 million, making it The 3rd highest grossing domestic Taiwanese film of all time.
In 2015, female director Yu Shan Chen (a.k.a. Frankie Chen) released a film entitled &quot;Our Times&quot; (2015), which was the highest-grossing domestic Taiwanese film of the year, grossing over NT$410 million ($17.1 million US dollars), thereby making it the 5th highest grossing domestic Taiwanese film of all time. The film also starred Vivian Sung from another box-office success, &quot;Café. Waiting. Love&quot; (2014), the 11th highest grossing domestic Taiwanese film of all time. In 2014, Umin Boya directed a baseball film entitled &quot;Kano&quot; (2014), which ended up grossing over NT$330 million, making it the 6th highest grossing domestic Taiwanese film of all time.

The 9th-15th highest grossing Taiwanese domestic films of all time are, in order: &quot;Zone Pro Site&quot; (2013) (#9 with NTD 305 million), Ang Lee&#x27;s &quot;Lust, Caution&quot; (2007) (#10 with NTD 280 million), &quot;Café. Waiting. Love&quot; (2014) (#11 with NTD 260 million), &quot;Monga&quot; (2010) (#12 with NTD 258 million), &quot;The Wonderful Wedding&quot; (2015) (#13 with NTD 250 million), &quot;Beyond Beauty: Taiwan from Above&quot; (2013) (#14 with NTD 220 million), and &quot;Twa-Tiu-Tiann&quot; (2014) (#15 with NTD 210 million).

Taiwanese filmmakers have attempted to cater to the Mainland Chinese market, and any films released on the mainland must comply with censorship that often involves downplaying or removing any indicators that Taiwan is a separate country from China. Such films include Hou Hsiao-hsien&#x27;s &quot;The Assassin&quot; (2015), Yu Shan Chen&#x27;s &quot;Our Times&quot; (2015), Giddens Ko&#x27;s &quot;You Are the Apple of My Eye&quot; (2012), and &quot;The Wonderful Wedding&quot; (2015). All of these focus on cross-cultural themes marketable on the mainland and other parts of Asia, while purposefully avoiding use of the Taiwanese dialect and common symbols of Taiwanese nationality, like the flag. This is even the case in &quot;The Wonderful Wedding&quot;, which relies on comedic misunderstandings between the families of a mainland Chinese groom and Taiwanese bride, but attributes them to cultural differences on the regional level not the national level, something that has been described as a &#x27;political whitewash&#x27;. Despite this, the film was more successful in Taiwan due to the variety of Taiwanese dialect comedic puns on Mandarin Chinese words. Successful films that focus on Taiwan have therefore predominantly been independent, low-budget, and aimed at the local market, such as John Hsu&#x27;s &quot;Detention&quot;, which received five awards including Best Director at the 56th Golden Horse Awards.

===Profit Sharing===
Teng Sue-feng used &quot;Cape No. 7&quot; as an example to discuss how profit is shared in Taiwan. Teng estimated the revenue to be NTD 520 million, and the production cost to be NTD 50 million. After deducting costs, 60% of the profit goes to movie theaters, and 10% to the distributor. The director gets about NT$140 million.

==Film censorship==

The first censorship in China under the Beiyang government came in July 1923, when the &quot;Film Censorship Committee of the Jiangsu Provincial Education Association&quot; was established in Jiangsu. It became more pervasive under the Nationalist government.

=== 1949 to 1983 ===
The ROC regained its footing in Taiwan, which was acquired from Japan in 1945 and the 1931 law still applies to the Fujian islands of Kinmen and Matsu. In 1955 (), 1956 (), and 1958 (), four more amendments to the law ensued without revising the main criteria. The law was renamed the Motion Picture Act () in November 1983, and expanded the censorship criteria to include the following:
* Hurts national interests or racial pride
* Violates national policy or government ordinance
* Agitates others to commit crimes or disobey laws
* Jeopardizes teenager or children&#x27;s health both physically or psychologically
* Disrupts public order or impedes good morality
* Advocates ridiculous heresy or misleads public opinion
* Defames persons of virtue from the past or distorts historical facts
Article 30 of the 1983 law lowered the age cutoff line from 12 to 6 to dictate whether the viewing should be restricted or not.

=== 1983 to the present ===
KMT practiced martial law until July 1987. After lifting it, the Executive Yuan, or through its now dissolved Government Information Office (GIO), promulgated regulations to carry out the said revised law starting in 1987 () and 1988 (). The then regulations revised the motion picture rating system, classifying films into three categories (General Audience/Parental Guidance/Restricted) based on age. The categories were expanded into four (General Audience/Protected/Parental Guidance/Restricted) in 1994 ().

The film law rephrased the censorship requirement in June 2015. To control the rating system requirement from a legislative perspective, article 9 of the new Motion Picture Act (), promulgated by the Legislative Yuan, maintains that motion pictures and their advertisements shall not be screened if not granted a rating by the central competent authority which shall convene a rating commission to rate films. Members of the commission shall be representatives of government agencies, and scholars and experts having academic or practical experience in related fields. The commission&#x27;s conclusions shall be made public and clear rationales for ratings given be listed. Article 10 maintains if motion pictures and their advertisements violate restrictions or prohibitions laid out in law, the central competent authority shall not grant a rating. The Ministry of Culture established by the Executive Yuan further specifies that not more than one third of the committee members can come from the Bureau of Audiovisual and Music Industry Development.

The rating system was expanded into five categories on October 16, 2015 per regulations () drawn up in accordance with the Motion Picture Act. 

*0+: General Audience ( or ) – Viewing is permitted for audiences of all ages.

<doc id="422001" wikidata="Q1198185" url="?curid=422001" title="Cinema of Hong Kong">
<text>The cinema of Hong Kong () is one of the three major threads in the history of Chinese-language cinema, alongside the cinema of China and the cinema of Taiwan. As a former Crown colony, Hong Kong had a greater degree of economic freedom than mainland China and Taiwan, and developed into a filmmaking hub for the Chinese-speaking world (including its worldwide diaspora).

For decades, Hong Kong was the third largest motion picture industry in the world following US cinema and Indian cinema, and the second largest exporter. Despite an industry crisis starting in the mid-1990s and Hong Kong&#x27;s transfer to Chinese sovereignty in July 1997, Hong Kong film has retained much of its distinctive identity and continues to play a prominent part on the world cinema stage. In the West, Hong Kong&#x27;s vigorous pop cinema (especially Hong Kong action cinema) has long had a strong cult following, which is now a part of the cultural mainstream, widely available and imitated.

Economically, the film industry together with the value added of cultural and creative industries represents 5 per cent of Hong Kong&#x27;s economy.

==The Hong Kong industry==
Unlike many film industries, Hong Kong has enjoyed little or no direct government support, through either subsidies or import quotas. It is a thoroughly commercial cinema: highly corporate, concentrating on crowd-pleasing genres like comedy and action, and relying heavily on formulas, sequels and remakes.

Hong Kong film derives a number of elements from Hollywood, such as certain genre parameters, a &quot;thrill-a-minute&quot; philosophy and fast pacing and film editing. But the borrowings are filtered through elements from traditional Chinese drama and art, particularly a penchant for stylisation and a disregard for Western standards of realism. This, combined with a fast and loose approach to the filmmaking process, contributes to the energy and surreal imagination that foreign audiences note in Hong Kong cinema.

In 2010, the box office gross in Hong Kong was HK$1.339 billion and in 2011 it was HK$1.379 billion. There were 56 Hong Kong films and 220 foreign films released in 2011.

In 2017, the box office gross was HK$1.85 billion compared with HK$1.95 billion in 2016. 331 films were released in 2017, dropped from 348 the year before.

===The star system===
According to Paul McDonald, a star system emerged in Hollywood as talent scouts, coaches, and publicists were involved with finding performers and making them into stars. In the vertically integrated Hollywood film industry of the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, these responsibilities were all undertaken by the studios themselves. The studios made the stars and, due to notoriously restrictive terms imposed by exclusive services contracts, the studios also owned the stars. As is common in commercial cinema, the industry&#x27;s heart is a highly developed star system. In earlier days, beloved performers from the Chinese opera stage often brought their audiences with them to the screen. For the past three or four decades, television has been a major launching pad for movie stardom, through acting courses and widely watched drama, comedy and variety series offered by the two major stations. Possibly even more important is the overlap with the Cantonese pop music industry. Many, if not most, movie stars have recording sidelines, and vice versa; this has been a key marketing strategy in an entertainment industry where American-style, multimedia advertising campaigns have until recently been little used. In the current commercially troubled climate, the casting of young Cantopop idols (such as Ekin Cheng and the Twins) to attract the all-important youth audience is endemic.

In the small and tightly knit industry, actors (as well as other personnel, such as directors) are kept very busy. During previous boom periods, the number of movies made by a successful figure in a single year could routinely reach double digits.

===Budgets===
Films are typically low-budget when compared with American films. A major release with a big star, aimed at &quot;hit&quot; status, will typically cost around US$5 million. A low-budget feature can go well below US$1 million. Occasional blockbuster projects by the very biggest stars (Jackie Chan or Stephen Chow, for example) or international co-productions (&quot;crossovers&quot;) aimed at the global market, can go as high as US$20 million or more, but these are rare exceptions. Hong Kong productions can nevertheless achieve a level of gloss and lavishness greater than these numbers might suggest, given factors such as lower wages and value of the Hong Kong dollar.

===Language and sound===
Films in the Cantonese language have been made in Hong Kong since the beginning. In the 1950s, it also became a center of Mandarin-language filmmaking after the Communist takeover in mainland China and the entertainment industry shifted from Shanghai to Hong Kong. From the 1960s to mid-1970s, Mandarin film productions became dominant, especially those made by the Shaw Brothers studio in Hong Kong. There was also a short-lived period whereby Hokkien films were produced in Hong Kong, and there were also films made in the Teochew dialect. Cantonese films made a comeback in the 1970s, and since the 1980s, films have been made mostly in Cantonese.

For decades, films were typically shot silent, with dialogue and all other sound dubbed afterwards. In the hectic and low-budget industry, this method was faster and more cost-efficient than recording live sound, particularly when using performers from different dialect regions; it also helped facilitate dubbing into other languages for the vital export market (for example, Standard Mandarin for mainland China and Taiwan). Many busy stars would not even record their own dialogue, but would be dubbed by a lesser-known performer. Shooting without sound also contributed to an improvisatory filmmaking approach. Movies often went into production without finished scripts, with scenes and dialogue concocted on the set; especially low-budget productions on tight schedules might even have actors mouth silently or simply count numbers, with actual dialogue created only in the editing process.

A trend towards sync sound filming grew in the late 1990s and this method is now the norm, partly because of a widespread public association with higher quality cinema.

==History==

===1909 to World War II===
During its early history, Hong Kong&#x27;s cinema played second fiddle to that of the mainland, particularly the city of Shanghai, which was then the movie capital of the Chinese-speaking world. Very little of this work is extant: one count finds only four films remaining out of over 500 produced in Hong Kong before World War II. Detailed accounts of this period therefore have inherent limitations and uncertainties.

====Pioneers from the stage====

As in most of China, the development of early films was tightly bound to Chinese opera, for centuries the dominant form of dramatic entertainment. Opera scenes were the source for what are generally credited as the first movies made in Hong Kong, two 1909 short comedies entitled &quot;Stealing a Roasted Duck&quot; and &quot;Right a Wrong with Earthenware Dish&quot;. The director was stage actor and director Liang Shaobo. The producer was an American, Benjamin Brodsky (sometimes transliterated &#x27;Polaski&#x27;), one of a number of Westerners who helped jumpstart Chinese film through their efforts to crack China&#x27;s vast potential market.

Credit for the first Hong Kong feature film is usually given to &quot;Zhuangzi Tests His Wife&quot; (1913), which also took its story from the opera stage, was helmed by a stage director and featured Brodsky&#x27;s involvement. Director Lai Man-Wai (Li Ming Wei or Li Minwei in Mandarin) was a theatrical colleague of Liang Shaobo&#x27;s who would become known as the &quot;Father of Hong Kong Cinema&quot;. In another borrowing from opera, Lai played the role of wife himself. His brother played the role of husband, and his wife a supporting role as a maid, making her the first Chinese woman to act in a Chinese film, a milestone delayed by longstanding taboos regarding female performers. &quot;Zhuangzhi&quot; was the only film made by Chinese American Film, founded by Lai and Brodsky as the first movie studio in Hong Kong, and was never actually shown in the territory.

The following year, the outbreak of World War I put a large crimp in the development of cinema in Hong Kong, as Germany was the source of the colony&#x27;s film stock. It was not until 1923 that Lai, his brother and their cousin joined with Liang Shaobo to form Hong Kong&#x27;s first entirely Chinese-owned-and-operated production company, the China Sun Motion Picture Company. In 1924, they moved their operation to the Mainland after government red tape blocked their plans to build a studio.

====The advent of sound====

With the popularity of talkies in the early 1930s, the problem of China&#x27;s various spoken dialects had to be grappled with. Hong Kong was a major center for Cantonese, one of the most widely spoken, and political factors on the Mainland provided other opportunities. In 1932, the Shaw brothers, who formed the Tianyi Film Company, teamed up with Cantonese opera singer to make the first Cantonese talkie, , in Shanghai. This film proved to be very successful, and in 1934, they established a branch of the Tianyi Studio in Kowloon to make Cantonese films. The government of the Kuomintang or Nationalist Party wanted to enforce a &quot;Mandarin-only&quot; policy and was hostile to Cantonese filmmaking in China. It also banned the wildly popular &quot;wuxia&quot; genre of martial arts swordplay and fantasy, accusing it of promoting superstition and violent anarchy. Cantonese film and film remained popular despite government hostility, and the British colony of Hong Kong became a place where both of these trends could be freely served. Tianyi soon moved the entire film production operation from Shanghai to Hong Kong and reorganised Tianyi into Nanyang () Productions. The name () soon became the standard name for black and white Cantonese movies.

Filmed Cantonese operas proved even more successful than &quot;&quot; and constituted the leading genre of the 1930s. Major studios that thrived in this period were Grandview, Universal, and Nanyang (which later became the Shaw Brothers Studio that would have an enduring influence on Chinese film).

====The war era====
Another important factor in the 1930s was the second Sino-Japanese War. &quot;National defense&quot; films—patriotic war stories about Chinese resisting the Japanese invasion—became one of Hong Kong&#x27;s major genres; notable titles included Kwan Man Ching&#x27;s &quot;Lifeline&quot; (1935), Chiu Shu Sun&#x27;s &quot;Hand to Hand Combat&quot; (1937) and Situ Huimin&#x27;s &quot;March of the Partisans&quot; (1938). The genre and the film industry were further boosted by emigre film artists and companies when Shanghai was taken by the Japanese in 1937.

This of course came to an end when Hong Kong itself fell to the Japanese in December 1941. But unlike on the Mainland, the occupiers were not able to put together a collaborationist film industry. They managed to complete just one propaganda movie, &quot;The Attack on Hong Kong&quot; (1942; a.k.a. &quot;The Day of England&#x27;s Collapse&quot;) before the British returned in 1945. A more important move by the Japanese may have been to melt down many of Hong Kong&#x27;s pre-war films to extract their silver nitrate for military use.

===The 1940s–1960s===

Postwar Hong Kong cinema, like postwar Hong Kong industries in general, was catalysed by the continuing influx of capital and talents from Mainland China. The Hong Kong population in 1940 was around 1 million and rose to around 3.9 million in 1967; the population increased around 2.9 million during this period. This became a flood with the 1946 resumption of the Chinese Civil War (which had been on hold during the fight against Japan) and then the 1949 Communist victory. These events definitively shifted the center of Chinese-language cinema to Hong Kong. The colony also did big business exporting films to Southeast Asian countries (especially but not exclusively due to their large Chinese expatriate communities) and to Chinatowns in Western countries.

====Competing languages====
The postwar era also cemented the bifurcation of the industry into two parallel cinemas, one in Mandarin, the dominant dialect of the Mainland emigres, and one in Cantonese, the dialect of most Hong Kong natives. The distinction between the two languages is in sound. During the silent film age the written language was Chinese and was known to all, no matter the language spoken. Subtitles allow both markets access to films. Mandarin movies sometimes had much higher budgets and more lavish production. Reasons included their enormous export market and the expertise and capital of the Shanghai filmmakers. For decades to come, Cantonese films, though sometimes more numerous, were relegated to second-tier status.

Most of the films reviewed by the Office for Film, Newspaper and Article Administration come with subtitles, although there is no law requiring them. According to Shu Kei (also known as Kenneth Ip), the reason for the inclusion of English subtitles must have been to target overseas audiences, while Chinese subtitles were added to reach those who could read Chinese, but could not understand Cantonese.

The books &quot;City on Fire: Hong Kong Cinema&quot; (1999) and &quot;Yang, 2003&quot; falsely claim that the British authorities passed a law in 1963 requiring the subtitling of all films in English, supposedly to enable a watch on political content. And that making a virtue of necessity, studios included Chinese subtitles as well, enabling easier access to their movies for speakers of other dialects.

Subtitling facilitated the movies&#x27; popularity in the West.

====Cantonese movies====

During this period, Cantonese opera on film dominated. The top stars were the female duo of Yam Kim Fai and Pak Suet Sin (Yam–Pak for short). Yam specialised in male scholar roles to Pak&#x27;s female leads. They made over fifty films together, &quot;The Purple Hairpin&quot; (1959) being one of the most enduringly popular (Teo, 1997).

Low-budget martial arts films were also popular. A series of roughly 100 kung fu movies starring Kwan Tak Hing as historical folk hero Wong Fei Hung were made, starting with &quot;The True Story of Wong Fei Hung&quot; (1949) and ending with &quot;Wong Fei Hung Bravely Crushing the Fire Formation&quot; (1970) (Logan, 1995). Fantasy &quot;wuxia&quot; (swordplay) serials with special effects drawn on the film by hand, such as &quot;The Six-Fingered Lord of the Lute&quot; (1965) starring teen idol Connie Chan Po-chu in the lead male role, were also popular, as were contemporary melodramas of home and family life, including the dramatisation of sibling rivalries in &quot;Our Sister Hedy&quot; (1957) starring Julie Yeh Feng.

====Mandarin movies and the Shaws/Cathay rivalry====
In Mandarin production, Shaw Brothers and Motion Picture and General Investments Limited (MP&amp;GI, later renamed Cathay) were the top studios by the 1960s, and bitter rivals. The Shaws gained the upper hand in 1964 after the death in a plane crash of MP&amp;GI founder and head Loke Wan Tho. The renamed Cathay faltered, ceasing film production in 1970 (Yang, 2003).

A musical genre called &quot;Huángméidiào&quot; () was derived from Chinese opera; the Shaws&#x27; record-breaking hit &quot;The Love Eterne&quot; (1963) remains the classic of the genre. Historical costume epics often overlapped with the , such as in &quot;The Kingdom and the Beauty&quot; (1959). (Both of the above examples were directed by Shaw&#x27;s star director, Li Han Hsiang). Romantic melodramas such as &quot;Red Bloom in the Snow&quot; (1956), &quot;Love Without End&quot; (1961), &quot;The Blue and the Black&quot; (1964) and adaptations of novels by Chiung Yao were popular. So were Hollywood-style musicals, which were a particular speciality of MP&amp;GI/Cathay in entries such as &quot;Mambo Girl&quot; (1957) and &quot;The Wild, Wild Rose&quot; (1960).

In 1960s, the Motion Picture and General Investments Limited produced a special set of romantic movies which was called Southern and Northern. The first one is &quot;The Greatest Civil Wall On Earth&quot; (1961), the second one is &quot;The Greatest Wedding On Earth&quot; (1962) and the third one is &quot;The Greatest Love Affair On Earth&quot; (1964). This set of movies was partly spoken in Cantonese and partly spoken in Mandarin. The set of movies portrayed differences between Northern and Southern China; in addition to the language differences, the movies also depicted cultural aspects such as weddings and food. The movies&#x27; main theme was a kind of cultural integration between North and South.

In the second half of the 1960s, the Shaws inaugurated a new generation of more intense, less fantastical films with glossier production values, acrobatic moves and stronger violence. The trend was inspired by the popularity of imported samurai movies from Japan, as well as by the loss of movie audiences to television. This marked the crucial turn of the industry from a female-centric genre system to an action movie orientation. Key trendsetters included Xu Zenghong&#x27;s &quot;Temple of the Red Lotus&quot; (1965), King Hu&#x27;s &quot;Come Drink with Me&quot; (1966) and &quot;Dragon Inn&quot; (1967, made in Taiwan; a.k.a. &quot;Dragon Gate Inn&quot;), and Chang Cheh&#x27;s &quot;Tiger Boy&quot; (1966), &quot;The One-Armed Swordsman&quot; (1967) and &quot;Golden Swallow&quot; (1968).

===Years of transformation (1970s)===
Mandarin-dialect film in general and the Shaw Brothers studio in particular began the 1970s in apparent positions of unassailable strength. Cantonese cinema virtually vanished in the face of Mandarin studios and Cantonese television, which became available to the general population in 1967; in 1972 no films in the local dialect were made. The Shaws saw their longtime rival Cathay ceasing film production, leaving themselves the only megastudio. The martial arts subgenre of the kung fu movie exploded into popularity internationally, with the Shaws driving and dominating the wave. But changes were beginning that would greatly alter the industry by the end of the decade.

====The Cantonese comeback====
Paradoxically, television would soon contribute to the revival of Cantonese in a movement towards more down-to-earth movies about modern Hong Kong life and average people.

The first spark was the ensemble comedy &quot;The House of 72 Tenants&quot;, the only Cantonese film made in 1973, a resounding hit. It was based on a well-known play and produced by the Shaws as a showcase for performers from their pioneering television station TVB.

The return of Cantonese really took off with the comedies of former TVB stars the Hui Brothers (actor-director-screenwriter Michael Hui, actor-singer Sam Hui and actor Ricky Hui). The rationale behind the move to Cantonese was clear in the trailer for the brothers&#x27; &quot;Games Gamblers Play&quot; (1974): &quot;Films by devoted young people with you in mind.&quot; This move back to the local audience for Hong Kong cinema paid off immediately. &quot;Games Gamblers Play&quot; initially made US$1.4 million at the Hong Kong box office, becoming the highest-grossing film up to that point. The Hui movies also broke ground by satirising the modern reality of an ascendant middle class, whose long work hours and dreams of material success were transforming the colony into a modern industrial and corporate giant. Cantonese comedy thrived and Cantonese production skyrocketed; Mandarin hung on into the early 1980s, but has been relatively rare onscreen since.

====Golden Harvest and the rise of the independents====
In 1970, former Shaw Brothers executives Raymond Chow and Leonard Ho left to form their own studio, Golden Harvest. The upstart&#x27;s more flexible and less tightfisted approach to the business outmaneuvered the Shaws&#x27; old-style studio. Chow and Ho landed contracts with rising young performers who had fresh ideas for the industry, like Bruce Lee and the Hui Brothers, and allowed them greater creative latitude than was traditional. California-born, Bruce Lee only found minor roles in U.S. films and television at first, as foreign actors were often criticized and not widely accepted by the audience during the 1970s in North America. Bruce expressed that the true orientals were not shown, especially in Hollywood, and most audiences still viewed Asian people as stereotypes (e.g. with flat eyes and pigtails). Moreover, the directors usually got him to do something just to be exotic. When Golden Harvest&#x27;s &quot;The Big Boss&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;The Fists of Fury&quot;, 1971) came into theatres, it jump-started Lee&#x27;s career into stardom and made martial arts and kung fu a global trend.

In 1976, Shaw Brothers made a series of true crime films. The first, &quot;The Criminals&quot;, took in HK$838,067, ranking at #33 in the Hong Kong box office for that year. Following its success, Shaw Brothers made &quot;The Criminals 2 – Homicides&quot; that same year, followed by three more films (&quot;The Criminals 3 – Arson&quot;, &quot;The Criminals 4 – Assault&quot; and &quot;The Criminals 5 – The Teenager&#x27;s Nightmare&quot;) the following year. The first movie in &quot;The Criminals&quot; series included three true stories: &quot;The Human Torsos&quot;, &quot;The Stuntmen,&quot; and &quot;Valley of the Hanged&quot;; each story was filmed by a different director. &quot;Valley of the Hanged&quot; told the story of a triple murder in Hong Kong, as well as a story about an unfaithful wife humiliating her husband. The Shaw Brothers&#x27; films attracted audiences with bizarre true stories featuring erotic and violent scenes. Their films also portrayed the ordinary aspects of Hong Kongers&#x27; lives, such as playing mahjong, a popular form of gambling.

By the end of the 1970s, Golden Harvest was the top studio, signing with Jackie Chan, the kung fu comedy actor-filmmaker who would spend the next 20 years as Asia&#x27;s biggest box office draw. Raymond Chow built upon Lee&#x27;s success with &quot;The Big Boss&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Fists of Fury&quot;, 1971), &quot;Fist of Fury&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;The Chinese Connection&quot;, 1972) and &quot;The Way of the Dragon&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;The Return of the Dragon&quot;, 1972), each of which broke Hong Kong box office records. Bruce Lee appeared with minor Hollywood actors in the larger budget &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; (1973), a co-production with Warner Bros. Lee&#x27;s death under mysterious circumstances made him a cult hero. Lee played a key role in opening foreign markets to Hong Kong films. Lee&#x27;s films, enjoyed throughout the Third World, were often taken as symbolising the rebellious pride of insurgent Asia.

Meanwhile, the explosions of Cantonese and kung fu and the success of Golden Harvest created more space for independent producers and production companies. The era of the studio juggernauts was past. The Shaws nevertheless continued film production until 1985 before turning entirely to television.

====Other transformative trends====
The rapidly growing permissiveness in film content that was general in much of the world affected Hong Kong film as well. A genre of softcore erotica known as became a local staple (the name is a contraction of a Chinese phrase implying seductive decadence). Such material did not suffer as much of a stigma in Hong Kong as in most Western countries; it was more or less part of the mainstream, sometimes featuring contributions from major directors such as Chor Yuen and Li Han Hsiang and often crossbreeding with other popular genres like martial arts, the costume film and especially comedy. Violence also grew more intense and graphic, particularly at the instigation of martial arts filmmakers.

Director Lung Kong blended these trends into the social-issue dramas which he had already made his speciality with late 1960s Cantonese classics like &quot;The Story of a Discharged Prisoner&quot; (1967) and &quot;Teddy Girls&quot; (1969). In the 1970s, he began directing in Mandarin and brought exploitation elements to serious films about subjects like prostitution (&quot;The Call Girls&quot; and &quot;Lina&quot;), the atomic bomb (&quot;Hiroshima 28&quot;) and the fragility of civilised society (&quot;Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow&quot; (1970), which portrayed a plague-decimated, near-future Hong Kong).

The brief career of Tang Shu Shuen, the territory&#x27;s first noted woman director, produced two films, &quot;The Arch&quot; (1968) and &quot;China Behind&quot; (1974), that were trailblazers for a local, socially critical art cinema. They are also widely considered forerunners of the last major milestone of the decade, the so-called Hong Kong New Wave that would come from outside the traditional studio hierarchy and point to new possibilities for the industry.

===1980s – early 1990s: the boom years===

The 1980s and early 1990s saw seeds planted in the 1970s come to full flower: the triumph of Cantonese, the birth of a new and modern cinema, superpower status in the East Asian market, and the turning of the West&#x27;s attention to Hong Kong film.

A cinema of greater technical polish and more sophisticated visual style, including the first forays into up-to-date special effects technology, sprang up quickly. To this surface dazzle, the new cinema added an eclectic mixing and matching of genres, and a penchant for pushing the boundaries of sensationalistic content. Slapstick comedy, sex, the supernatural, and above all action (of both the martial arts and cops-and-criminals varieties) ruled, occasionally all in the same film.

Some of the iconic films during this period include &quot;The Killer&quot; (1989), by John Woo, which is archetypal of the heroic bloodshed genre.

====The international market====
During this period, the Hong Kong industry was one of the few in the world that thrived in the face of the increasing global dominance of Hollywood. Indeed, it came to exert a comparable dominance in its own region of the world. The regional audience had always been vital, but now more than ever Hong Kong product filled theatres and video shelves in places like Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and South Korea. Taiwan became at least as important a market to Hong Kong film as the local one; in the early 1990s the once-robust Taiwanese film industry came close to extinction under the onslaught of Hong Kong imports. They even found a foothold in Japan, with its own highly developed and well-funded cinema and strong taste for American movies; Jackie Chan and Leslie Cheung were some of the stars who became very popular there.

Almost accidentally, Hong Kong also reached further into the West, building upon the attention gained during the 1970s kung fu craze. Availability in Chinatown theatres and video shops allowed the movies to be discovered by Western film cultists attracted by their &quot;exotic&quot; qualities and excesses. An emergence into the wider popular culture gradually followed over the coming years.

====Leaders of the boom====

The trailblazer was production company Cinema City, founded in 1980 by comedians Karl Maka, Raymond Wong and Dean Shek. It specialised in contemporary comedy and action, slickly produced according to explicitly prescribed commercial formulas. The lavish, effects-filled spy spoof &quot;Aces Go Places&quot; (1982) and its numerous sequels epitomised the much-imitated &quot;Cinema City style&quot;.

Directors and producers Tsui Hark and Wong Jing can be singled out as definitive figures of this era. Tsui was a notorious Hong Kong New Wave tyro who symbolised that movement&#x27;s absorption into the mainstream, becoming the industry&#x27;s central trendsetter and technical experimenter The even more prolific Wong is, by most accounts, the most commercially successful and critically reviled Hong Kong filmmaker of the last two decades, with his relentless output of aggressively crowd-pleasing and cannily marketed pulp films.

Other hallmarks of this era included the gangster or &quot;Triad&quot; movie trend launched by director John Woo, producer and long-time actor Alan Tang and dominated by actor Chow Yun-fat; romantic melodramas and martial arts fantasies starring Brigitte Lin; the comedies of stars like Cherie Chung and Stephen Chow; traditional kung fu movies dominated by Jet Li; and contemporary, stunt-driven kung fu action epitomised by the work of Jackie Chan.

====Category III films====
The government&#x27;s introduction of a film ratings system in 1988 had a certainly unintended effect on subsequent trends. The &quot;Category III&quot; (adults-only) rating became an umbrella for the rapid growth of pornographic and generally outré films; however, while considered graphic by Chinese standards, these films would be more on par with movies rated &quot;R&quot; or &quot;NC-17&quot; in the United States, and not &quot;XXX&quot;. By the height of the boom in the early 1990s, roughly half of the theatrical features produced were Category III-rated softcore erotica descended from the movies of the 1970s. A definitive example of a mainstream Category III hit was Michael Mak&#x27;s &quot;Sex and Zen&quot; (1991), a period comedy inspired by &quot;The Carnal Prayer Mat&quot;, the seventeenth century classic of comic-erotic literature by Li Yu. &quot;Naked Killer&quot; (1992) also became an international cult classic.

The rating also covered a trend for grisly, taboo-tweaking exploitation and horror films, often supposedly based on true crime stories, such as &quot;Men Behind the Sun&quot; (1988), &quot;Dr. Lamb&quot; (1992), &quot;The Untold Story&quot; (1993) and &quot;Ebola Syndrome&quot; (1996). Films depicting Triad rituals would also receive a Category III rating, an example of this being &quot;Crime Story&quot; (1993) starring Jackie Chan.

Since the mid-1990s, the trend has withered with the shrinking of the general Hong Kong film market and the wider availability of pornography in home video formats. But in 2000s, three Category III movies: &quot;Election&quot;, its sequel, &quot;Election 2&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Triad Election&quot;), and &quot;Mad Detective&quot;, all directed by Johnnie To, still enjoyed surprising box office successes in Hong Kong.

====Alternative cinema====
In this landscape of pulp, there remained some ground for an alternative cinema or art cinema, due at least in part to the influence of the New Wave. Some New Wave filmmakers such as Ann Hui and Yim Ho continued to earn acclaim with personal and political films made at the edges of the mainstream.

The second half of the 1980s also saw the emergence of what is sometimes called a &quot;Second Wave&quot;. These younger directors included names like Stanley Kwan, Clara Law and her partner Eddie Fong, Mabel Cheung, Lawrence Ah Mon and Wong Kar-wai. Like the New Wavers, they tended to be graduates of overseas film schools and local television apprenticeships, and to be interested in going beyond the usual, commercial subject matters and styles.

These artists began to earn Hong Kong unprecedented attention and respect in international critical circles and the global film festival circuit. In particular, Wong Kar-wai&#x27;s works starring Leslie Cheung, Tony Leung Chiu-Wai and Maggie Cheung in the 1990s have made him an internationally acclaimed and award-winning filmmaker.

===Mid-1990s – present: Post-boom===

====The industry in crisis====
During the 1990s, the Hong Kong film industry underwent a drastic decline from which it has not recovered. Domestic ticket sales had already started to drop in the late 1980s, but the regional audience kept the industry booming into the early years of the next decade. But by the mid-1990s, it went into freefall. Revenues were cut in half. By the decade&#x27;s end, the number of films produced in a typical year dropped from an early 1990s high of well over 200 to somewhere around 100 (a large part of this reduction was in the &quot;Category III&quot; softcore pornography area.) American blockbuster imports began to regularly top the box office for the first time in decades. Ironically, this was the same period during which Hong Kong cinema emerged into mainstream visibility in the U.S. and began exporting popular figures to Hollywood.

Numerous, converging factors have been blamed for the downturn:

* The Asian financial crisis, which dried up traditional sources of film finance as well as regional audiences&#x27; leisure spending money.
* Overproduction, attended by a drop in quality control and an exhaustion of overused formulas.
* A costly early 1990s boom in building of modern multiplexes and an attendant rise in ticket prices.
* An increasingly cosmopolitan, upwardly mobile Hong Kong middle class that often looks down upon local films as cheap and tawdry.
* Rampant video piracy throughout East Asia.
* A newly aggressive push by Hollywood studios into the Asian market.

The greater access to the Mainland that came with the July 1997 handover to China, was not as much of a boom as hoped, and presented its own problems, particularly with regard to censorship.

The industry had one of its darkest years in 2003. In addition to the continuing slump, a SARS virus outbreak kept many theatres virtually empty for a time and shut down film production for four months; only fifty-four movies were made. The unrelated deaths of two of Hong Kong&#x27;s famous singer–actors, Leslie Cheung, 46, and Anita Mui, 40, rounded out the bad news.

The Hong Kong Government, in April 2003, introduced a Film Guarantee Fund as an incentive to local banks to become involved in the motion picture industry. The guarantee operates to secure a percentage of monies loaned by banks to film production companies. The Fund has received a mixed reception from industry participants, and less than enthusiastic reception from financial institutions who perceive investment in local films as high risk ventures with little collateral. Film guarantee legal documents commissioned by the Hong Kong Government in late April 2003 are based on Canadian documents, which have limited relevance to the local industry.

====Recent trends====

Efforts by local filmmakers to refinish their product have had mixed results overall. These include technically glossier visuals, including much digital imagery; greater use of Hollywood-style mass marketing techniques; and heavy reliance on casting teen-friendly Cantopop music stars. Successful genre cycles in the late 1990s and early 2000s have included: American-styled, high-tech action pictures such as &quot;Downtown Torpedoes&quot; (1997), &quot;Gen-X Cops&quot; and &quot;Purple Storm&quot; (both 1999), &quot;The Legend of Zu&quot;, &quot;Gen-Y Cops&quot;, &quot;The Avenging Fist&quot; (all three were released in 2001), the &quot;Triad kids&quot; subgenre launched by &quot;Young and Dangerous&quot; (1996–2000); yuppie-centric romantic comedies like &quot;The Truth About Jane and Sam&quot; (1999), &quot;Needing You...&quot; (2000), &quot;Love on a Diet&quot; (2001); and supernatural chillers like &quot;Horror Hotline: Big-Head Monster&quot; (2001) and &quot;The Eye&quot; (2002), often modelled on the Japanese horror films then making an international splash.

In the 2000s, there have been some bright spots. Milkyway Image, founded by filmmakers Johnnie To and Wai Ka-Fai in the mid-1990s, has had considerable critical and commercial success, especially with offbeat and character-driven crime films like &quot;The Mission&quot; (1999) and &quot;Running on Karma&quot; (2003). An even more successful example of the genre was the blockbuster &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; trilogy (2002–2003) of police thrillers co-directed by Andrew Lau and Alan Mak (the Oscar-winning movie &quot;The Departed&quot;, was based on this movie). Comedian Stephen Chow, the most consistently popular screen star of the 1990s, directed and starred in &quot;Shaolin Soccer&quot; (2001) and &quot;Kung Fu Hustle&quot; (2004); these used digital special effects to push his distinctive humor into new realms of the surreal and became the territory&#x27;s two highest-grossing films to date, garnering numerous awards locally and internationally. Johnnie To&#x27;s two Category III movies: &quot;Election&quot; and &quot;Election 2&quot; also enjoyed Hong Kong box office successes. &quot;Election 2&quot; has even been released in the US theatrically under the new title &quot;Triad Election&quot;; this movie received very positive reviews in the United States, with a more than 90% &quot;Fresh&quot; rating on Rotten Tomatoes. New LGBT films such as &quot;City Without Baseball&quot; (2008), &quot;Permanent Residence&quot; (2009) and &quot;Amphetamine&quot; (2009) followed the success of earlier 1990s films such as &quot;Bugis Street&quot; (a 1995 Hong Kong–Singapore co-production), and &quot;Hold You Tight&quot; (1998).

Still, some observers believe that, given the depressed state of the industry and the rapidly strengthening economic and political ties among Hong Kong, mainland China and Taiwan, the distinctive entity of Hong Kong cinema that emerged after World War II may have a limited lifespan. The lines between the mainland and Hong Kong industries are ever more blurred, especially now that China is producing increasing numbers of slick, mass-appeal popular films. Predictions are notoriously difficult in this rapidly changing part of the world, but the trend may be towards a more pan-Chinese cinema, as existed in the first half of the twentieth century.

==== Censorship ====
In June 2021, the Hong Kong Film Censorship Authority OFNAA introduced a new national security policy. This law passed on 27 October 2021. It gives the chief secretary the power to revoke a film&#x27;s licence if it is found to &quot;endorse, support, glorify, encourage and incite activities that might endanger national security&quot;. Under the new law, the maximum penalties for showing unapproved films are three years in jail and a fine of HK$1 million. Critics like professor Kenny Ng and filmmaker Kiwi Chow voice concerns of its political censorship, spurring fears the new law would dampen the film industry.

In June 2022, &quot;The Dancing Voice of Youth&quot; was censored, and in August 2022, &quot;Losing Side of a Longed Place&quot; was censored. In October 2022, the OFNAA recommended the screening of &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; be cancelled. In October 2022, the OFNAA also banned &quot;The Lucky Woman&quot; from being screened due to protest scenes that took place at Taiwan&#x27;s Presidential Office Building.

In April 2023, &quot;Wake in Silence&quot; failed to get approval from the OFNAA, allegedly because the film showed a flag that said &quot;100% freedom.&quot;

In June 2023, more films were censored by the OFNAA at a local Hong Kong film festival. In June 2023, the OFNAA said that the Film Censorship Ordinance, which stipulates that films must be pre-approved by the OFNAA before public release, did not apply to films produced by the government.

<doc id="422004" wikidata="Q337595" url="?curid=422004" title="Sidney Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Lea">
<text>Sidney Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Lea, PC (16 September 1810 – 2 August 1861) was a British statesman and a close ally and confidant of Florence Nightingale.

==Early life==
He was the younger son of George Herbert, 11th Earl of Pembroke, his mother being the Russian noblewoman Countess Catherine Woronzow (or Vorontsov), daughter of the Russian ambassador to St James&#x27;s, Semyon Vorontsov. Woronzow Road in St John&#x27;s Wood, London, is named after the family. Educated at Harrow and Oriel College, Oxford, he made a reputation at the Oxford Union as a speaker.

==Career==
Herbert entered the House of Commons as Conservative Member of Parliament for a division of Wiltshire in 1832. Under Robert Peel he held minor offices, and in 1845 was included in the cabinet as Secretary at War. Herbert stayed loyal to Peel and was considered to be a Peelite or a Liberal Conservative. In 1852 he was appointed as Secretary at War in the coalition government of Lord Aberdeen from 1852 to 1854, being responsible for the War Office during the Crimean War. Herbert briefly held office in the first Lord Palmerston ministry in 1855 but resigned when the government agreed to an enquiry into the conduct of the government in the Crimean War. Herbert returned to office again as Secretary at War in 1859, by which time the post had been combined with the office of Secretary of State for War.

Herbert was a member of the Canterbury Association from 20 March 1848.

He ran the Pembroke family estates, centred at Wilton House, Wiltshire, for most of his adult life. His elder half-brother, Robert Herbert, 12th Earl of Pembroke (1791–1862), had chosen to live in exile in Paris after a disastrous marriage in 1814 (annulled 1818) to a Sicilian princess (Ottavia Spinelli di Laurino, Princess of Butera).

Herbert asked his friend Florence Nightingale to lead a team of nurses out to Scutari during the Crimean War, and together he and Nightingale led the movement after the war for Army health and reform of the War Office. The hard work entailed caused a breakdown in his health, so that in July 1861, having been created a baron in the peerage of the United Kingdom, he had to resign government office.

==Personal life==
In the early 1840s, Herbert is thought to have had an affair with the noted society beauty and author Caroline Norton, who was unable to get a divorce from an abusive husband, so that the relationship ended in 1846.

In 1846 Herbert married Elizabeth (1822–1911), only daughter of Lt.-Gen. Charles Ashe à Court-Repington and niece of William à Court, 1st Baron Heytesbury. She was a philanthropist, author and translator, and a friend of Benjamin Disraeli, Cardinal Manning and Cardinal Vaughan. After her husband&#x27;s death, Lady Herbert became an &quot;ardent ultramontane&quot; Roman Catholic, along with their eldest daughter, Mary.

Sidney and Elizabeth Herbert lived at 49 Belgrave Square, London, and had seven children:

#Mary Catherine (1849–1935), who m. 1873 the great modernist theologian, Baron (Freiherr) Friedrich von Hügel.
#George Robert Charles Herbert (1850–1895), who succeeded in the title and later became the 13th Earl of Pembroke, and the barony is now merged in that earldom.
#Elizabeth Maud (1851–1933), who m. 1872 the composer, Sir Charles Hubert Parry, 1st Baronet (son of Thomas Gambier Parry), of Highnam Court, near Gloucester.
#Sidney Herbert (1853–1913), also a Member of Parliament, who succeeded his brother as the 14th Earl of Pembroke.
#William Reginald Herbert (1854–1870), lost at sea aboard HMS &quot;Captain&quot;, aged 16.
#Michael Henry Herbert (The Hon. Sir Michael Herbert, KCMG, CB, PC) (1857–1904), after whom the town of Herbert in Saskatchewan, Canada, is named, was a diplomat who ended his career as British Ambassador to the US in Washington DC in succession to Lord Pauncefote. He m. 1888 Lelia &quot;Belle&quot;, daughter of Richard Thornton Wilson, a New York banker and cotton broker, and had (with one other son) Sir Sidney Herbert, 1st Baronet.
#Constance Gwladys (1859–1917), who m. 1st 1878 St George Henry Lowther, 4th Earl of Lonsdale (issue, 1 daughter) and m. 2ndly 1885 Frederick Oliver Robinson, the Earl de Grey, later 2nd and last Marquess of Ripon (no issue).

== Death and memorials ==

Herbert died from Bright&#x27;s disease shortly after leaving government office, on 2 August 1861. He is buried in the churchyard at Wilton, rebuilt by his father in neo-Romanesque style, with inside the church a marble monumental effigy of him beside Elizabeth, his wife (who, however, was buried at St Joseph&#x27;s Missionary College, Mill Hill, where she was a notable patron).

His statue by Foley was placed in front of the War Office in Pall Mall, London, and subsequently, following that building&#x27;s demolition, placed next to A. G. Walker&#x27;s statue of Florence Nightingale in Waterloo Place, adjacent to the Crimean Monument.

Another statue to him stands in Victoria Park, Salisbury, Wiltshire. There is also a memorial to him on Inchkeith island in the Firth of Forth, which commemorates his advocacy for fortifying the island.

Herbert Sound in the Antarctic and Pembroke, Ontario in Canada are named after Sidney Herbert. In New Zealand, the highest peak on Banks Peninsula was named Mount Herbert by the chief surveyor of the Canterbury Association, Joseph Thomas, in 1849. The Otago surveyor&#x27;s office renamed the town of Wānaka to Pembroke in 1863.

<text>Klaus Riedel (2 August 1907 – 4 August 1944) was a German rocket pioneer. He was involved in many early liquid-fuelled rocket experiments, and eventually worked on the V-2 missile programme at Peenemünde Army Research Center. A lunar crater is named after him in recognition of his contributions to rocket research.

==History==
Riedel was born in Wilhelmshaven, the son of a naval officer. His mother died when he was twelve years old, and his father two years later. The orphaned Riedel was raised by his uncle in Berlin. In 1923, Riedel began an apprenticeship as an electrician in Berlin and completed it with a journeyman&#x27;s certificate. He then attended “Dr. Heil&#x27;s private school” in Berlin from April 1927 to April 1928. From April 1928 to October 1929, he attended general mechanical engineering lectures at the Technische Hochschule Berlin-Charlottenburg. He attended a public lecture on rocketry by Rudolf Nebel on behalf of Germany&#x27;s amateur rocket group, the &quot;Verein für Raumschiffahrt&quot; (VfR – &quot;Spaceflight Society&quot;) and joined the group which included others such as Rolf Engel, Rudolf Nebel, Hermann Oberth or Paul Ehmayr, straight away, becoming very active in its efforts to build a working rocket based on liquid oxygen and gasoline, initially providing his grandmother&#x27;s farm in Bernstadt as a testing ground. Together with Nebel, he founded the activities of the Berlin rocket launching site and met Wernher von Braun. His work eventually resulted in the Mirak and Repulsor rockets. In May 1931, the first German liquid-propellant rocket was launched and missiles were tested at altitudes of up to 1,000 meters.

In May 1932, Riedel became a founding member of the &quot;Panterra s&quot;ociety for international projects of large-scale peaceful research, as initiated by Albert Einstein and headed by Friedrich Simon Archenhold. He was also a member of the German League for Human Rights until it was banned by the Nazi Party in 1933.

After the VfR disbanded in 1933, Riedel refused to join Wernher von Braun in the army&#x27;s rocket programme and worked for Siemens. He accepted von Braun&#x27;s offer only in August 1937 after the army paid compensation for a 1931 rocketry patent &quot;Thrust Engine for Liquid Propellants&quot; owned by him and Rudolf Nebel. Riedel was called &quot;Riedel II&quot;, and his initial position in Peenemünde was &quot;Head of the Test Laboratory&quot;. From 1941, he was mostly concerned with developing the mobile support equipment for the V-2 and became &quot;Head of Ground Equipment&quot; .

Riedel had been under SD surveillance since the beginning of Nazi Germany in 1933. A Gestapo report of March 1944 stated that he, Wernher von Braun, and his colleague Helmut Gröttrup were said to have expressed regret at an engineer&#x27;s house one evening that they were not working on a spaceship and that they felt the war was not going well; this was considered a &quot;defeatist&quot; attitude. A young female dentist who was an SS spy reported their comments. Combined with Himmler&#x27;s false charges that they were communist sympathizers and had attempted to sabotage the V-2 program, the Gestapo detained them on 21 March 1944, and took them to a Gestapo cell in Stettin (now Szczecin, Poland), where they were held for two weeks without knowing the charges against them. Major-General Walter Dornberger, military head of Peenemünde, and major Hans Georg Klamroth, representative for counterintelligence at Peenemünde, obtained their conditional release so that the V-2 program could continue.

Klaus Riedel was killed in a mysterious car accident on a straight road near Zinnowitz two days after his thirty-seventh birthday when travelling home from work. He left behind his wife Irmgard Kutwin and an 18 month old daughter.
== Dedications ==
There is a memorial with Riedel&#x27;s bust in Kirchgasse 11 and a small museum nearby, dedicated to him in Bernstadt where he started his first Minimum rocket in 1930. In 1970, a crater on the Moon was named after him and Walter Riedel (&quot;Riedel I&quot;, not related to him).

<doc id="422011" wikidata="Q468206" url="?curid=422011" title="Fermin">
<text>Fermin (also Firmin, from Latin &quot;Firminus&quot;; Spanish &quot;Fermín&quot;) was a holy man and martyr, traditionally venerated as the co-patron saint of Navarre, Spain. He was born in the mid 3rd century, so his death may be associated with the Diocletianic Persecution (303).

Although he is said to have lived in the third century, the first texts we have about saint Fermin date back to the ninth century. It may originate in the diocese of Toulouse, which endeavoured to spread the devotion to Saint Fermin. His tombstone is one of the elements that helped to convey his memory.

According to the legend, a senator from Pamplona named Firmus was converted to Christianity by Honestus and persuaded Saturninus to come to Pamplona to baptise him. There the bishop preached to large crowds and baptised some 40,000 people over three days. Firmus&#x27;s son, Firminus (Fermin), was entrusted to Honestus for his Christian education and at age 31 went to Toulouse to be consecrated by Saturninus&#x27;s successor, Honoratus. Fermin then went to preach in northern Gaul, where he became associated with the city of Amiens. He was persecuted and ultimately martyred.

Fermin&#x27;s feast is celebrated in Pamplona with a series of festivities, the Sanfermines, including the famous Running of the Bulls. He is also venerated at Amiens.

==Legend==
Fermin is said to have been the son of Eugenia and Firmo, a Roman of senatorial rank in Pamplona in the 3rd century. Fermin was converted to Christianity by Honestus, a disciple of Saturnin. According to tradition, he was baptised by Saturninus (in Navarra &quot;San Cernin&quot;) at the spot now known as the &quot;Pocico de San Cernin,&quot; the &quot;Small Well of San Cernin&quot;, across from the facade of the church dedicated to St Cernin, which is built on the foundations of a pagan temple.

Saturninus was the first bishop of Toulouse, where he was sent during the &quot;consulate of Decius and Gratus&quot; (AD 250). He was martyred (traditionally in 257 AD), significantly by being tied to a bull by his feet and dragged to his death, a martyrdom that is sometimes transferred to Fermin. In Toulouse, the earliest church, dedicated to &quot;Notre-Dame du Taur&quot; (&quot;Our Lady of the Bull&quot;), still exists, though rebuilt. Though the 11th century Basilica of Saint-Sernin, the largest surviving Romanesque structure in France, has superseded it, the church is said to be built where the bull stopped. More likely, it was built on a site previously dedicated to a pre-Christian sacred bull, perhaps the bull of Mithras. The street, which runs straight from the Capitole, is named not the &quot;Rue de Notre-Dame&quot; but the &quot;Rue du Taur&quot;. San Cernin (Saturninus) is the patron saint of Pamplona.

Fermin was ordained a priest in Toulouse, according to the local legend, and returned to Pamplona as its first bishop. Some years later, he preached the gospel through Aquitania, Auvernia and Anjou, before settling in Amiens, France, where he was also named Bishop of Amiens. The local authorities in Amiens had him imprisoned and later beheaded. He died on September 25, AD 303.

In &quot;Legenda aurea&quot; several miracles attended the discovery and translation of the relics of Saint Fermin in the time of Salvius, bishop of Amiens (traditionally &quot;ca&quot; 600). According to the legend, a sweet odor arose from his grave, which caused ice and snow to melt, flowers to grow, the sick to be cured, and trees to be inclined reverently toward the saint.

==Veneration==
The Abbey of Saint-Acheul in Amiens was founded in 1085 on the supposed tomb of Fermin.
Under the choir of the abbey&#x27;s church there is a vault in the place where the body of Fermin was miraculously discovered. According to legend the place of the body was revealed to Bishop Salvius of Amiens, who arranged to have it carried to Amiens Cathedral. The veneration of Saint Fermin was of great religious and economic importance to Amiens during the Middle Ages and into modern times. Legends grew up to explain the discovery of the saint&#x27;s relics, most of which were held at Amiens. He is represented in a number of major works of art in Amiens Cathedral. When certain relics of the saint were brought back to Pamplona in 1196, the city decided to mark the occasion with an annual event. Over the centuries, the saint&#x27;s festival, the ancient annual fair and the running of the bulls and subsequent bullfights have all melded together.

Besides Pamplona, Fermín is venerated in other places in Navarre, such as Lesaka, in the fiesta called the &quot;Regata del Bidasoa&quot;. In the basilica of San Fermín de Aldapa, the martyrdom of Saint Fermin is still commemorated on September 25. On the preceding Thursday to Sunday there are numerous festivities there, in the Navarrería (a neighbourhood of Pamplona) and near the Cathedral. Celebrations begin with a firework rocket set off by a youngster from the Navarrería, who has been given the title of the little mayor. As at Pamplona, the celebrations have a special closing ceremony called &quot;Pobre de Mí&quot; (&quot;Poor Me&quot;).

There is a mysterious well of an otherwise unknown &quot;Saint Farmin&quot; at Bowes, Yorkshire, England. The existence of a monastery named after a Saint Firmin in North Crawley was recorded in the Domesday Book (i.149a); there was a holy well in the churchyard, and unauthorized pilgrimages there were suppressed in 1298. The church at Thurlby, Lincs, is dedicated to St Firmin. The only other St. Firmin in England rested at Thorney, Cambridgeshire. These occurrences point towards possible veneration of Firmin in Anglo-Saxon England.

The San Fermin festival is celebrated in Pamplona, in the region of Navarre, every year from the 6th to the 14th of July. It has become internationally known because of the running of the bulls, where the bulls are led through the streets of the old quarter as far as the bull ring by runners. The fiestas are celebrated in honor of Fermin, co-patron saint of Navarra, although the religious aspect would seem to have taken on a secondary role over the last number of years.

== Gallery ==
The funeral monument of Adrien de Henencourt, head of the chapter of Amiens Cathedral in the early 16th century, depicts not only the life and martyrdom of the saint, but also the posthumous history of his body, in a series of polychrome reliefs and statuary.

<doc id="422012" wikidata="Q7016158" url="?curid=422012" title="1987 New Zealand general election">
<text>The 1987 New Zealand general election was a nationwide vote to determine the shape of the 42nd sitting of the New Zealand Parliament. The governing New Zealand Labour Party, led by Prime Minister David Lange, was re-elected for a second term, although the Opposition National Party made gains. The election also saw the elimination of the Democratic Party (formerly the Social Credit Party) from Parliament, leaving Labour and National as the only parties represented.

1987 marked the first time that a Labour Government had been reelected to a second term since 1938, and the first to be reelected overall since 1946. This was in spite of the fact that this was the fourth consecutive election in which Labour won the popular vote. 

==Background==
Before the election, the Labour Party (in government) held 56 seats, giving it an absolute majority in Parliament. The National Party (in opposition) held 37 seats. The Democrats, a small party devoted to the principles of Social Credit, held two seats. The 1985 Timaru by-election, triggered by the death of sitting MP Sir Basil Arthur had resulted in National winning the seat from Labour.

Of particular importance in the election were the economic reforms being undertaken by Roger Douglas, the Minister of Finance. These reforms, sometimes known as &quot;Rogernomics&quot;, involved monetarist approaches to controlling inflation, corporatisation of government departments, and the removal of tariffs and subsidies. All these things were strongly opposed by many traditional Labour supporters, who saw them as a betrayal of the party&#x27;s left-wing principles. Many commentators believed that public anger over Rogernomics could cost the government the election.

Another matter of importance, and perhaps one which enabled Labour to survive public dissatisfaction, was the nuclear issue. In the previous parliamentary term, New Zealand had adopted the New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act, which prevented nuclear weapons or nuclear-powered ships entering New Zealand, a move which provoked an angry reaction from New Zealand&#x27;s allies in the ANZUS treaty. The National Party intended to revoke the ban, but the New Zealand public were supportive of it. Labour&#x27;s support for the ban is often considered to be an important factor in the party&#x27;s re-election.

National was also bitterly divided, with some supporting the Rogernomics reforms, but MPs such as former Prime Minister Robert Muldoon bitterly opposed. Muldoon had undermined his successor as party leader, Jim McLay, who was replaced by his deputy Jim Bolger in 1986. Bolger was more centrist, but National still struggled to be seen as an alternative government. Lange famously mocked Bolger as &quot;an itinerant masseur, massaging the politically erogenous zones.&quot; Several groups on the Christian Right (such as the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children (SPUC), Coalition of Concerned Citizens (CCC) and Women for Life) attempted to obtain electoral influence by infiltrating the National Party. They attempted to select socially conservative Christians as candidates to oppose the Labour government&#x27;s policies towards peace education, sex education, abortion, Māori biculturalism, and the ANZUS alliance. Several CCC supporters contested the election as National candidates, including Rob Wheeler (Mount Albert), Andrew Stanley (Onehunga), and Howard Martin (Papatoetoe). However, the efforts met little electoral success as none were elected.

===MPs retiring in 1987===
Six National MPs and six Labour MPs intended to retire at the end of the 41st Parliament.

==Electoral changes==
The 1987 electoral redistribution took the continued population growth in the North Island into account, and two additional general electorates were created, bringing the total number of electorates to 97. In the South Island, the shift of population to Christchurch had continued. Overall, three electorates were newly created (, , and ), three electorates were recreated (, , and ), and four electorates were abolished (, Hauraki, , and ). All of those electorates were in the North Island. Changes in the South Island were restricted to boundary changes.

==Election day==
The election was held on 15 August, and 2,114,656 people were registered to vote. Turnout was 89.1%, somewhat lower than the 1984 election.

==Summary of results==
The election saw the Labour Party win 57 seats, enough for it to retain its outright majority. Labour held two more seats than after the previous election. The National Party won 40 seats, an increase of three. It was possible for both parties to increase their number of seats partly due to the disappearance of the Democrats and partly due to the increase in the total number of seats. This is the most recent election where only the two major parties, Labour and National won every seat in the House of Representatives.

Although Labour emerged from the election with a 17-seat lead over National, the difference between each party&#x27;s vote count was considerably smaller. Labour&#x27;s share of the vote was 48.0% (up from 43.0% in 1984), while National&#x27;s was 44.0% (up from 35.5%). While Labour did retain its lead, the gap between Labour and National closed by a larger extent than the seat count would indicate.

The Democrats, despite winning 5.7% of the total vote, did not win any electorates, including the two that they had held before the election. The Democrats have not regained parliamentary representation under their own name since losing it in these elections, although they did manage to enter parliament as part of the larger Alliance in 1996.

The New Zealand Party, which had gained 12.2% of the vote in the previous election, performed poorly, gaining less than 0.3% support.

===Electoral petition===
The election night result for Wairarapa was for National by 65 votes. The final official count later gave the seat to the incumbent, Reg Boorman of the Labour Party, by a margin of seven votes, but a judicial recount reduced that to only one vote. But on 12 July 1988, following a petition to the Electoral Court, Wyatt Creech of the National Party was declared elected by a margin of 34 votes (9,994 to 9,960). The petition was supported initially by MPs Roger McClay and Winston Peters (who had been involved in challenges in Taupo and Hunua) but not by the party hierarchy, according to Creech&#x27;s account in a book by Ross Meurant).

==Detailed results==

===Party totals===
===Votes summary===


There were 97 seats being contested, two more than were in the previous parliament. All seats were won by one of the two major parties.

The Labour Party, which was in government, won 57 seats, giving it a majority. Most of the seats won by Labour were in the poorest urban and largest inner-city areas, following the party&#x27;s typical pattern. Labour was particularly strong in the Wellington region, where it won all ten urban seats. It was also strong in the Western and the Southern poorer areas of Auckland, Christchurch and Dunedin, the other three urban centres, as well as in smaller cities such as Hamilton, New Plymouth, Nelson, Napier, Hastings and Palmerston North. Labour also retained its traditional dominance in the Maori seats, winning all four by large margins.

The National Party, also following its traditional patterns, was strongest in rural areas, winning the vast majority of seats in these regions. The party&#x27;s primary wins in the affluent urban areas of both the Northern and Eastern parts of Auckland, with the party taking six seats. The party also won a number of seats in smaller cities, such as Rotorua, Tauranga, Invercargill and Whangārei. The party performed poorly in the Maori electorates, coming third in all four.

While no minor parties managed to win an electorate, several did manage to gain second place, outperforming one of the major parties but being defeated by the other. The Democrats (formerly Social Credit) was the strongest of the minor parties, coming second in five electorates. Two electorates, East Coast Bays and Pakuranga, were held by the Democrats prior to the election, but were narrowly lost to National candidates. In the other electorates (Coromandel, Rangitikei and Wanganui) the Democrats were the challengers. In the four Maori electorates, the Mana Motuhake party gained second place. Its best result, 31.6%, was obtained in Northern Maori. The New Zealand Party also performed strongly in some electorates, although not as strongly as in the previous election.

Independent candidates did not perform well in the 1987 election, with none of them winning a seat or even placing second.

<doc id="422013" wikidata="Q640868" url="?curid=422013" title="Count of Barcelona">
<text>The count of Barcelona (, , , ) was the ruler of the County of Barcelona and also, by extension and according with the Usages and Catalan constitutions, of the Principality of Catalonia as prince for much of Catalan history, from the 9th century until the 18th century. After 1164, with Alfonso II of Aragon and I of Barcelona, the title of count of Barcelona was united with that of king of Aragon, and after the 16th century, with that of king of Spain.

==History==

The Emperor Charlemagne conquered the area north of the river Ebro and captured the city of Barcelona in 801. He then organized these lands, historiographically known as the &quot;Marca Hispanica&quot;, into various counties, one of which was the County of Barcelona, with the city of Barcelona as its capital. The Count of Barcelona, usually holding other counties simultaneously, eventually obtained primacy over the region. As the County became hereditary in one family, the bond of the Counts to their Frankish overlords loosened, especially after the Capetian dynasty supplanted the Carolingians.

In 1150, Count Raymond Berengar IV married Queen Petronilla of Aragon. Their son Alfonso succeeded as Count and also as King of Aragon, establishing the Crown of Aragon. In the Treaty of Corbeil (1258), King Louis IX of France relinquished France&#x27;s historical claim to the County. In 1516, Queen Joanna of Castile also succeeded in Catalonia and Aragon, forming the Monarchy of Spain. The title of Count of Barcelona remained one of the many hereditary titles of the Spanish monarchy.

In the 20th century, the title regained some prominence when Juan de Borbón, the exiled heir to the Spanish throne, adopted the title of Count of Barcelona. In doing so, he claimed a historical royal title without claiming to be the current king of Spain, especially after his son Juan Carlos became the prospective successor of the then-ruler of Spain, Francisco Franco. In 1977, after Juan Carlos had become king upon Franco&#x27;s death in 1975, he officially awarded the comital title to his father, who had renounced his rights to the throne. Juan held that title until his death in 1993, when it reverted to Juan Carlos. Juan de Borbón&#x27;s widow used the title Countess of Barcelona until her death in 2000.

==List of counts of Barcelona==

===Non-dynastic (appointed by the rulers of the Carolingian Empire), 801–878===

During this period, the County of Barcelona was one of many Counties at the March located in the Eastern Pyrenees and known as Gothia or Marca Hispanica. The Counts of this March were appointed by the Carolingian authorities.

===House of Sunifred (Bellonids), 878–1162===
The crisis of the Carolingian Empire, incapable of attending to the requests for help against the Moorish attacks coming from the Catalan counts, resulted in a disconnection between them and the Carolingian central power far North. The County of Barcelona became a hereditary title.

=== House of Trastamara 1412-1462 ===

Martin died without legitimate descendants (&quot;interregnum&quot; 31 May 1410 – 24 June 1412). By the Compromise of Caspe of 1412 the County of Barcelona and the rest of the dominions of the Crown of Aragon passed to a branch of the House of Trastamara.

=== Catalan Civil War 1462-1472 ===

During the Catalan Civil War the Catalan authorities transferred the title of Count of Barcelona to a succession of 3 foreign sovereigns.

=== House of Trastamara (reinstated) 1472-1555 ===

After the Catalan Civil War, the House of Trastamara was restituted as tenants of the Count of Barcelona title and thus sovereigns of the Principality of Catalonia.

=== House of Habsburg 1516-1641 ===

=== House of Bourbon at France (Reapers&#x27; War), 1641–1659 ===

=== House of Habsburg (reinstated) 1659–1700 ===

In 1697, French troops under the Duke of Vendôme captured Barcelona, and Louis XIV of France was reinstated as Count of Barcelona for some months. On 9 January 1698, Catalonia (including Barcelona) was returned to Charles II by the Peace of Ryswick.

=== War of the Spanish Succession (1700–1714) ===
Charles II named as his successor Philip of Anjou, a younger grandson of Louis XIV. The other European powers thought that meant too much power for France. They tried to impose another candidate as King of Spain: Archduke Charles of Austria, in the War of the Spanish Succession. The Catalans were caught in the middle of this major conflict. They initially supported Philip, but then shifted their allegiance to Charles, who was committed to maintaining the composite monarchy system and thus respected the Catalan Constitutions. However, Philip won the war.


=== House of Bourbon (Spanish branch) 1714–1808 ===

In 1714, Catalonia, which had supported the Habsburg pretender to the Spanish throne, Archduke Charles of Austria, lost their war within the Spanish war of Succession against the Bourbon pretender Philip of Anjou. Through the Nueva Planta decrees, Philip of Anjou as the new king of Spain Philip V abolished the Catalan Constitutions and dissolved the Crown of Aragon and merged its territories with the territories of the Crown of Castile to form the Kingdom of Spain. The Principality of Catalonia became another province and thus the title of Count of Barcelona was emptied of real political significance and power. Since then, the numbering of the Counts of Barcelona follows that of the Crown of Castille. That is the reason why Philip of Anjou was called by the Catalan Authorities &#x27;Felip IV&#x27; in 1702 but called himself &#x27;Felipe V&#x27; when he sized the title of Count of Barcelona in 1714, after winning the war against the Catalans.


=== House of Bonaparte 1808–1813 ===

In 1808 Charles IV and his son Ferdinand resign from their Crown of Spain titles and transfer them to Emperor Napoleon, who kept for himself the title of Count of Barcelona. By 1812, once he had full military control over the Principality of Catalonia, he separated it from the Crown of Spain and annexed it to the French Empire.

=== House of Bourbon (restored) 1813–1868 ===

Isabella of Spain was deposed by a liberal revolution and went into exile.

=== House of Savoy 1870–1873 ===
After a brief Republican period, the Spanish government offered the kingship and its accessory titles (including that of &#x27;Count of Barcelona&#x27;) to Amadeo Duke of Aosta and son of the king of Italy Victor Emmanuel II.

=== House of Bourbon (restored) 1874–1931 ===

A pronunciamiento deposed the Republican government that followed the abdication of Amadeo I and restored the Bourbons as kings of Spain.

In the 12 April 1931 municipal elections, the Republicans short of winning a majority of councilors overall, won a sweeping majority in major cities. These elections were perceived as a plebiscite on the monarchy, and the king left the country and the Second Spanish Republic was proclaimed on 14 April 1931.

=== House of Bourbon (in exile) 1931–1975 ===
During the 2nd Spanish Republic and Francoist Dictatorship the Bourbons remained in exile and retained their dynastic titles, including &#x27;Count of Barcelona&#x27;.

=== House of Bourbon (restored) 1975 – present day ===
Although on 26 July 1947, Spain was declared a kingdom, no monarch was designated until 1969, when Franco established Juan Carlos of Bourbon as his official heir. With the death of Franco on 20 November 1975, Juan Carlos became the King of Spain.

<text>Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is an obsolete, severely flawed security algorithm for 802.11 wireless networks. Introduced as part of the original IEEE 802.11 standard ratified in 1997, its intention was to provide security/privacy comparable to that of a traditional wired network. WEP, recognizable by its key of 10 or 26 hexadecimal digits (40 or 104 bits), was at one time widely used, and was often the first security choice presented to users by router configuration tools. 
Subsequent to a 2001 disclosure of a severe design flaw in the algorithm, WEP was never again secure in practice. In the vast majority of cases, Wi-Fi hardware devices relying on WEP security could not be upgraded to secure operation. Some of the design flaws were addressed in WEP2, but WEP2 also proved insecure, and another generation of hardware could not be upgraded to secure operation. 

In 2003, the Wi-Fi Alliance announced that WEP and WEP2 had been superseded by Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA). In 2004, with the ratification of the full 802.11i standard (i.e. WPA2), the IEEE declared that both WEP-40 and WEP-104 have been deprecated. WPA retained some design characteristics of WEP that remained problematic.

WEP was the only encryption protocol available to 802.11a and 802.11b devices built before the WPA standard, which was available for 802.11g devices. However, some 802.11b devices were later provided with firmware or software updates to enable WPA, and newer devices had it built in.

==History==
WEP was ratified as a Wi-Fi security standard in 1999. The first versions of WEP were not particularly strong, even for the time they were released, due to U.S. restrictions on the export of various cryptographic technologies. These restrictions led to manufacturers restricting their devices to only 64-bit encryption. When the restrictions were lifted, the encryption was increased to 128 bits. Despite the introduction of 256-bit WEP, 128-bit remains one of the most common implementations.

==Encryption details==
WEP was included as the privacy component of the original IEEE 802.11 standard ratified in 1997. WEP uses the stream cipher RC4 for confidentiality, and the CRC-32 checksum for integrity. It was deprecated in 2004 and is documented in the current standard.
Standard 64-bit WEP uses a 40-bit key (also known as WEP-40), which is concatenated with a 24-bit initialization vector (IV) to form the RC4 key. At the time that the original WEP standard was drafted, the U.S. Government&#x27;s export restrictions on cryptographic technology limited the key size. Once the restrictions were lifted, manufacturers of access points implemented an extended 128-bit WEP protocol using a 104-bit key size (WEP-104).

A 64-bit WEP key is usually entered as a string of 10 hexadecimal (base 16) characters (0–9 and A–F). Each character represents 4 bits, 10 digits of 4 bits each gives 40 bits; adding the 24-bit IV produces the complete 64-bit WEP key (4 bits × 10 + 24-bit IV = 64-bit WEP key). Most devices also allow the user to enter the key as 5 ASCII characters (0–9, a–z, A–Z), each of which is turned into 8 bits using the character&#x27;s byte value in ASCII (8 bits × 5 + 24-bit IV = 64-bit WEP key); however, this restricts each byte to be a printable ASCII character, which is only a small fraction of possible byte values, greatly reducing the space of possible keys.

A 128-bit WEP key is usually entered as a string of 26 hexadecimal characters. 26 digits of 4 bits each gives 104 bits; adding the 24-bit IV produces the complete 128-bit WEP key (4 bits × 26 + 24-bit IV = 128-bit WEP key). Most devices also allow the user to enter it as 13 ASCII characters (8 bits × 13 + 24-bit IV = 128-bit WEP key).

152-bit and 256-bit WEP systems are available from some vendors. As with the other WEP variants, 24 bits of that is for the IV, leaving 128 or 232 bits for actual protection. These 128 or 232 bits are typically entered as 32 or 58 hexadecimal characters (4 bits × 32 + 24-bit IV = 152-bit WEP key, 4 bits × 58 + 24-bit IV = 256-bit WEP key). Most devices also allow the user to enter it as 16 or 29 ASCII characters (8 bits × 16 + 24-bit IV = 152-bit WEP key, 8 bits × 29 + 24-bit IV = 256-bit WEP key).

==Authentication==
Two methods of authentication can be used with WEP: Open System authentication and Shared Key authentication.

In Open System authentication, the WLAN client does not provide its credentials to the access point during authentication. Any client can authenticate with the access point and then attempt to associate. In effect, no authentication occurs. Subsequently, WEP keys can be used for encrypting data frames. At this point, the client must have the correct keys.

In Shared Key authentication, the WEP key is used for authentication in a four-step challenge–response handshake:
# The client sends an authentication request to the access point.
# The access point replies with a clear-text challenge.
# The client encrypts the challenge-text using the configured WEP key and sends it back in another authentication request.
# The access point decrypts the response. If this matches the challenge text, the access point sends back a positive reply.

After the authentication and association, the pre-shared WEP key is also used for encrypting the data frames using RC4.

At first glance, it might seem as though Shared Key authentication is more secure than Open System authentication since the latter offers no real authentication. However, it is quite the reverse. It is possible to derive the keystream used for the handshake by capturing the challenge frames in Shared Key authentication. Therefore, data can be more easily intercepted and decrypted with Shared Key authentication than with Open System authentication. If privacy is a primary concern, it is more advisable to use Open System authentication for WEP authentication, rather than Shared Key authentication; however, this also means that any WLAN client can connect to the AP. (Both authentication mechanisms are weak; Shared Key WEP is deprecated in favor of WPA/WPA2.)

==Weak security==

Because RC4 is a stream cipher, the same traffic key must never be used twice. The purpose of an IV, which is transmitted as plaintext, is to prevent any repetition, but a 24-bit IV is not long enough to ensure this on a busy network. The way the IV was used also opened WEP to a related-key attack. For a 24-bit IV, there is a 50% probability the same IV will repeat after 5,000 packets.

In August 2001, Scott Fluhrer, Itsik Mantin, and Adi Shamir published a cryptanalysis of WEP that exploits the way the RC4 ciphers and IV are used in WEP, resulting in a passive attack that can recover the RC4 key after eavesdropping on the network. Depending on the amount of network traffic, and thus the number of packets available for inspection, a successful key recovery could take as little as one minute. If an insufficient number of packets are being sent, there are ways for an attacker to send packets on the network and thereby stimulate reply packets, which can then be inspected to find the key. The attack was soon implemented, and automated tools have since been released. It is possible to perform the attack with a personal computer, off-the-shelf hardware, and freely available software such as aircrack-ng to crack &quot;any&quot; WEP key in minutes.

Cam-Winget et al. surveyed a variety of shortcomings in WEP. They wrote &quot;Experiments in the field show that, with proper equipment, it is practical to eavesdrop on WEP-protected networks from distances of a mile or more from the target.&quot; They also reported two generic weaknesses:
* the use of WEP was optional, resulting in many installations never even activating it, and
* by default, WEP relies on a single shared key among users, which leads to practical problems in handling compromises, which often leads to ignoring compromises.

In 2005, a group from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation gave a demonstration where they cracked a WEP-protected network in three minutes using publicly available tools. Andreas Klein presented another analysis of the RC4 stream cipher. Klein showed that there are more correlations between the RC4 keystream and the key than the ones found by Fluhrer, Mantin, and Shamir, which can additionally be used to break WEP in WEP-like usage modes.

In 2006, Bittau, Handley, and Lackey showed that the 802.11 protocol itself can be used against WEP to enable earlier attacks that were previously thought impractical. After eavesdropping a single packet, an attacker can rapidly bootstrap to be able to transmit arbitrary data. The eavesdropped packet can then be decrypted one byte at a time (by transmitting about 128 packets per byte to decrypt) to discover the local network IP addresses. Finally, if the 802.11 network is connected to the Internet, the attacker can use 802.11 fragmentation to replay eavesdropped packets while crafting a new IP header onto them. The access point can then be used to decrypt these packets and relay them on to a buddy on the Internet, allowing real-time decryption of WEP traffic within a minute of eavesdropping the first packet.

In 2007, Erik Tews, Andrei Pyshkin, and Ralf-Philipp Weinmann were able to extend Klein&#x27;s 2005 attack and optimize it for usage against WEP. With the new attack it is possible to recover a 104-bit WEP key with a probability of 50% using only 40,000 captured packets. For 60,000 available data packets, the success probability is about 80%, and for 85,000 data packets, about 95%. Using active techniques like Wi-Fi deauthentication attacks and ARP re-injection, 40,000 packets can be captured in less than one minute under good conditions. The actual computation takes about 3 seconds and 3 MB of main memory on a Pentium-M 1.7 GHz and can additionally be optimized for devices with slower CPUs. The same attack can be used for 40-bit keys with an even higher success probability.

In 2008 the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) updated the Data Security Standard (DSS) to prohibit use of WEP as part of any credit-card processing after 30 June 2010, and prohibit any new system from being installed that uses WEP after 31 March 2009. The use of WEP contributed to the TJ Maxx parent company network invasion.

===Caffe Latte attack===

The Caffe Latte attack is another way to defeat WEP. It is not necessary for the attacker to be in the area of the network using this exploit. By using a process that targets the Windows wireless stack, it is possible to obtain the WEP key from a remote client. By sending a flood of encrypted ARP requests, the assailant takes advantage of the shared key authentication and the message modification flaws in 802.11 WEP. The attacker uses the ARP responses to obtain the WEP key in less than 6 minutes.

==Countermeasures==
Use of encrypted tunneling protocols (e.g., IPsec, Secure Shell) can provide secure data transmission over an insecure network. However, replacements for WEP have been developed with the goal of restoring security to the wireless network itself.

===802.11i (WPA and WPA2)===
The recommended solution to WEP security problems is to switch to WPA2. WPA was an intermediate solution for hardware that could not support WPA2. Both WPA and WPA2 are much more secure than WEP. To add support for WPA or WPA2, some old Wi-Fi access points might need to be replaced or have their firmware upgraded. WPA was designed as an interim software-implementable solution for WEP that could forestall immediate deployment of new hardware. However, TKIP (the basis of WPA) has reached the end of its designed lifetime, has been partially broken, and has been officially deprecated with the release of the 802.11-2012 standard.

===Implemented non-standard fixes===

==== WEP2 ====
This stopgap enhancement to WEP was present in some of the early 802.11i drafts. It was implementable on &quot;some&quot; (not all) hardware not able to handle WPA or WPA2, and extended both the IV and the key values to 128 bits. It was hoped to eliminate the duplicate IV deficiency as well as stop brute-force key attacks.

After it became clear that the overall WEP algorithm was deficient (and not just the IV and key sizes) and would require even more fixes, both the WEP2 name and original algorithm were dropped. The two extended key lengths remained in what eventually became WPA&#x27;s TKIP.

====WEPplus====
WEPplus, also known as WEP+, is a proprietary enhancement to WEP by Agere Systems (formerly a subsidiary of Lucent Technologies) that enhances WEP security by avoiding &quot;weak IVs&quot;. It is only completely effective when WEPplus is used at &quot;both ends&quot; of the wireless connection. As this cannot easily be enforced, it remains a serious limitation. It also does not necessarily prevent replay attacks, and is ineffective against later statistical attacks that do not rely on weak IVs.

====Dynamic WEP====
Dynamic WEP refers to the combination of 802.1x technology and the Extensible Authentication Protocol. Dynamic WEP changes WEP keys dynamically. It is a vendor-specific feature provided by several vendors such as 3Com.

The dynamic change idea made it into 802.11i as part of TKIP, but not for the WEP protocol itself.

<text>Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA), Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2), and Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3) are the three security certification programs developed after 2000 by the Wi-Fi Alliance to secure wireless computer networks. The Alliance defined these in response to serious weaknesses researchers had found in the previous system, Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP).

WPA (sometimes referred to as the TKIP standard) became available in 2003. The Wi-Fi Alliance intended it as an intermediate measure in anticipation of the availability of the more secure and complex WPA2, which became available in 2004 and is a common shorthand for the full IEEE 802.11i (or IEEE 802.11i-2004) standard.

In January 2018, the Wi-Fi Alliance announced the release of WPA3, which has several security improvements over WPA2.

As of 2023, most computers that connect to a wireless network have support for using WPA, WPA2, or WPA3.

==Versions==
===WEP===
WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) was an early encryption protocol for wireless networks, designed to secure WLAN connections. It supported 64-bit and 128-bit keys, combining user-configurable and factory-set bits. WEP used the RC4 algorithm for encrypting data, creating a unique key for each packet by combining a new Initialization Vector (IV) with a shared key (it has 40 bits of vectored key and 24 bits of random numbers). Decryption involved reversing this process, using the IV and the shared key to generate a key stream and decrypt the payload. Despite its initial use, WEP&#x27;s significant vulnerabilities led to the adoption of more secure protocols.

===WPA===

The Wi-Fi Alliance intended WPA as an intermediate measure to take the place of WEP pending the availability of the full IEEE 802.11i standard. WPA could be implemented through firmware upgrades on wireless network interface cards designed for WEP that began shipping as far back as 1999. However, since the changes required in the wireless access points (APs) were more extensive than those needed on the network cards, most pre-2003 APs could not be upgraded to support WPA.

The WPA protocol implements the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP). WEP used a 64-bit or 128-bit encryption key that must be manually entered on wireless access points and devices and does not change. TKIP employs a per-packet key, meaning that it dynamically generates a new 128-bit key for each packet and thus prevents the types of attacks that compromised WEP.

WPA also includes a Message Integrity Check, which is designed to prevent an attacker from altering and resending data packets. This replaces the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) that was used by the WEP standard. CRC&#x27;s main flaw was that it did not provide a sufficiently strong data integrity guarantee for the packets it handled. Well-tested message authentication codes existed to solve these problems, but they required too much computation to be used on old network cards. WPA uses a message integrity check algorithm called &quot;TKIP&quot; to verify the integrity of the packets. TKIP is much stronger than a CRC, but not as strong as the algorithm used in WPA2. Researchers have since discovered a flaw in WPA that relied on older weaknesses in WEP and the limitations of the message integrity code hash function, named &quot;Michael&quot;, to retrieve the keystream from short packets to use for re-injection and spoofing.

===WPA2===

Ratified in 2004, WPA2 replaced WPA. WPA2, which requires testing and certification by the Wi-Fi Alliance, implements the mandatory elements of IEEE 802.11i. In particular, it includes support for CCMP, an AES-based encryption mode. Certification began in September, 2004. From March 13, 2006, to June 30, 2020, WPA2 certification was mandatory for all new devices to bear the Wi-Fi trademark.
In WPA2-protected WLANs, secure communication is established through a multi-step process. Initially, devices associate with the Access Point (AP) via an association request. This is followed by a 4-way handshake, a crucial step ensuring both the client and AP have the correct Pre-Shared Key (PSK) without actually transmitting it. During this handshake, a Pairwise Transient Key (PTK) is generated for secure data exchange.

WPA2 employs the Advanced Encryption Standard AES with a 128-bit key, enhancing security through the Counter-Mode/CBC-Mac Protocol CCMP. This protocol ensures robust encryption and data integrity, using different Initialization Vectors (IVs) for encryption and authentication purposes.

The 4-way handshake involves:
* The AP sending a random number (ANonce) to the client.
* The client responding with its random number (SNonce).
* The AP calculating the PTK from these numbers and sending an encrypted message to the client.
* The client decrypting this message with the PTK, confirming successful authentication.

Post-handshake, the established PTK is used for encrypting unicast traffic, and the Group Temporal Key (GTK) is used for broadcast traffic. This comprehensive authentication and encryption mechanism is what makes WPA2 a robust security standard for wireless networks.

===WPA3===
In January 2018, the Wi-Fi Alliance announced WPA3 as a replacement to WPA2. Certification began in June 2018, and WPA3 support has been mandatory for devices which bear the &quot;Wi-Fi CERTIFIED™&quot; logo since July 2020.

The new standard uses an equivalent 192-bit cryptographic strength in WPA3-Enterprise mode (AES-256 in GCM mode with SHA-384 as HMAC), and still mandates the use of CCMP-128 (AES-128 in CCM mode) as the minimum encryption algorithm in WPA3-Personal mode. TKIP is not allowed in WPA3.

The WPA3 standard also replaces the pre-shared key (PSK) exchange with Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) exchange, a method originally introduced with IEEE 802.11s, resulting in a more secure initial key exchange in personal mode and forward secrecy. The Wi-Fi Alliance also says that WPA3 will mitigate security issues posed by weak passwords and simplify the process of setting up devices with no display interface. WPA3 also supports Opportunistic Wireless Encryption (OWE) for open Wi-Fi networks that do not have passwords.

Protection of management frames as specified in the IEEE 802.11w amendment is also enforced by the WPA3 specifications.

==Hardware support==
WPA has been designed specifically to work with wireless hardware produced prior to the introduction of WPA protocol, which provides inadequate security through WEP. Some of these devices support WPA only after applying firmware upgrades, which are not available for some legacy devices.

Wi-Fi devices certified since 2006 support both the WPA and WPA2 security protocols. WPA3 is required since July 1, 2020.

==WPA terminology==
Different WPA versions and protection mechanisms can be distinguished based on the target end-user (such as WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA3) and the method of authentication key distribution, as well as the encryption protocol used. As of July 2020, WPA3 is the latest iteration of the WPA standard, bringing enhanced security features and addressing vulnerabilities found in WPA2. WPA3 improves authentication methods and employs stronger encryption protocols, making it the recommended choice for securing Wi-Fi networks.

===Target users (authentication key distribution)===
====WPA-Personal====
Also referred to as &quot;WPA-PSK&quot; (pre-shared key) mode, this is designed for home, small office and basic uses and does not require an authentication server. Each wireless network device encrypts the network traffic by deriving its 128-bit encryption key from a 256-bit shared key. This key may be entered either as a string of 64 hexadecimal digits, or as a passphrase of 8 to 63 printable ASCII characters. This pass-phrase-to-PSK mapping is nevertheless not binding, as Annex J is informative in the latest 802.11 standard. If ASCII characters are used, the 256-bit key is calculated by applying the PBKDF2 key derivation function to the passphrase, using the SSID as the salt and 4096 iterations of HMAC-SHA1. WPA-Personal mode is available on all three WPA versions.

====WPA-Enterprise====
This enterprise mode uses an 802.1X server for authentication, offering higher security control by replacing the vulnerable WEP with the more advanced TKIP encryption. TKIP ensures continuous renewal of encryption keys, reducing security risks. Authentication is conducted through a RADIUS server, providing robust security, especially vital in corporate settings. This setup allows integration with Windows login processes and supports various authentication methods like Extensible Authentication Protocol, which uses certificates for secure authentication, and PEAP, creating a protected environment for authentication without requiring client certificates.

===Encryption protocol===
; TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol): The RC4 stream cipher is used with a 128-bit per-packet key, meaning that it dynamically generates a new key for each packet. This is used by WPA.
; CCMP (CTR mode with CBC-MAC Protocol): The protocol used by WPA2, based on the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cipher along with strong message authenticity and integrity checking is significantly stronger in protection for both privacy and integrity than the RC4-based TKIP that is used by WPA. Among informal names are &quot;AES&quot; and &quot;AES-CCMP&quot;. According to the 802.11n specification, this encryption protocol must be used to achieve fast 802.11n high bitrate schemes, though not all implementations enforce this. Otherwise, the data rate will not exceed 54 Mbit/s.

==EAP extensions under WPA and WPA2 Enterprise==
Originally, only EAP-TLS (Extensible Authentication Protocol - Transport Layer Security) was certified by the Wi-Fi alliance. In April 2010, the Wi-Fi Alliance announced the inclusion of additional EAP types to its WPA- and WPA2-Enterprise certification programs. This was to ensure that WPA-Enterprise certified products can interoperate with one another.

 the certification program includes the following EAP types:
* EAP-TLS (previously tested)
* EAP-TTLS/MSCHAPv2 (April 2005)
* PEAPv0/EAP-MSCHAPv2 (April 2005)
* PEAPv1/EAP-GTC (April 2005)
* PEAP-TLS
* EAP-SIM (April 2005)
* EAP-AKA (April 2009)
* EAP-FAST (April 2009)

802.1X clients and servers developed by specific firms may support other EAP types. This certification is an attempt for popular EAP types to interoperate; their failure to do so is one of the major issues preventing rollout of 802.1X on heterogeneous networks.

Commercial 802.1X servers include Microsoft Network Policy Server and Juniper Networks Steelbelted RADIUS as well as Aradial Radius server. FreeRADIUS is an open source 802.1X server.

==Security issues==
===Weak password===
WPA-Personal and WPA2-Personal remain vulnerable to password cracking attacks if users rely on a weak password or passphrase. WPA passphrase hashes are seeded from the SSID name and its length; rainbow tables exist for the top 1,000 network SSIDs and a multitude of common passwords, requiring only a quick lookup to speed up cracking WPA-PSK.

Brute forcing of simple passwords can be attempted using the Aircrack Suite starting from the four-way authentication handshake exchanged during association or periodic re-authentication.

WPA3 replaces cryptographic protocols susceptible to off-line analysis with protocols that require interaction with the infrastructure for each guessed password, supposedly placing temporal limits on the number of guesses. However, design flaws in WPA3 enable attackers to plausibly launch brute-force attacks .

===Lack of forward secrecy===
WPA and WPA2 do not provide forward secrecy, meaning that once an adverse person discovers the pre-shared key, they can potentially decrypt all packets encrypted using that PSK transmitted in the future and even past, which could be passively and silently collected by the attacker. This also means an attacker can silently capture and decrypt others&#x27; packets if a WPA-protected access point is provided free of charge at a public place, because its password is usually shared to anyone in that place. In other words, WPA only protects from attackers who do not have access to the password. Because of that, it&#x27;s safer to use Transport Layer Security (TLS) or similar on top of that for the transfer of any sensitive data. However starting from WPA3, this issue has been addressed.

===WPA packet spoofing and decryption===
In 2013, Mathy Vanhoef and Frank Piessens significantly improved upon the WPA-TKIP attacks of Erik Tews and Martin Beck. They demonstrated how to inject an arbitrary number of packets, with each packet containing at most 112 bytes of payload. This was demonstrated by implementing a port scanner, which can be executed against any client using WPA-TKIP. Additionally, they showed how to decrypt arbitrary packets sent to a client. They mentioned this can be used to hijack a TCP connection, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript when the victim visits a website.
In contrast, the Beck-Tews attack could only decrypt short packets with mostly known content, such as ARP messages, and only allowed injection of 3 to 7 packets of at most 28 bytes. The Beck-Tews attack also requires quality of service (as defined in 802.11e) to be enabled, while the Vanhoef-Piessens attack does not. Neither attack leads to recovery of the shared session key between the client and Access Point. The authors say using a short rekeying interval can prevent some attacks but not all, and strongly recommend switching from TKIP to AES-based CCMP.

Halvorsen and others show how to modify the Beck-Tews attack to allow injection of 3 to 7 packets having a size of at most 596 bytes. The downside is that their attack requires substantially more time to execute: approximately 18 minutes and 25 seconds. In other work Vanhoef and Piessens showed that, when WPA is used to encrypt broadcast packets, their original attack can also be executed. This is an important extension, as substantially more networks use WPA to protect broadcast packets, than to protect unicast packets. The execution time of this attack is on average around 7 minutes, compared to the 14 minutes of the original Vanhoef-Piessens and Beck-Tews attack.

The vulnerabilities of TKIP are significant because WPA-TKIP had been held before to be an extremely safe combination; indeed, WPA-TKIP is still a configuration option upon a wide variety of wireless routing devices provided by many hardware vendors. A survey in 2013 showed that 71% still allow usage of TKIP, and 19% exclusively support TKIP.

===WPS PIN recovery===
A more serious security flaw was revealed in December 2011 by Stefan Viehböck that affects wireless routers with the Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) feature, regardless of which encryption method they use. Most recent models have this feature and enable it by default. Many consumer Wi-Fi device manufacturers had taken steps to eliminate the potential of weak passphrase choices by promoting alternative methods of automatically generating and distributing strong keys when users add a new wireless adapter or appliance to a network. These methods include pushing buttons on the devices or entering an 8-digit PIN.

The Wi-Fi Alliance standardized these methods as Wi-Fi Protected Setup; however, the PIN feature as widely implemented introduced a major new security flaw. The flaw allows a remote attacker to recover the WPS PIN and, with it, the router&#x27;s WPA/WPA2 password in a few hours. Users have been urged to turn off the WPS feature, although this may not be possible on some router models. Also, the PIN is written on a label on most Wi-Fi routers with WPS, which cannot be changed if compromised.

In 2018, the Wi-Fi Alliance introduced Wi-Fi Easy Connect as a new alternative for the configuration of devices that lack sufficient user interface capabilities by allowing nearby devices to serve as an adequate UI for network provisioning purposes, thus mitigating the need for WPS.

===MS-CHAPv2 and lack of AAA server CN validation===
Several weaknesses have been found in MS-CHAPv2, some of which severely reduce the complexity of brute-force attacks, making them feasible with modern hardware. In 2012 the complexity of breaking MS-CHAPv2 was reduced to that of breaking a single DES key (work by Moxie Marlinspike and Marsh Ray). Moxie advised: &quot;Enterprises who are depending on the mutual authentication properties of MS-CHAPv2 for connection to their WPA2 Radius servers should immediately start migrating to something else.&quot;

Tunneled EAP methods using TTLS or PEAP which encrypt the MSCHAPv2 exchange are widely deployed to protect against exploitation of this vulnerability. However, prevalent WPA2 client implementations during the early 2000s were prone to misconfiguration by end users, or in some cases (e.g. Android), lacked any user-accessible way to properly configure validation of AAA server certificate CNs. This extended the relevance of the original weakness in MSCHAPv2 within MiTM attack scenarios. Under stricter compliance tests for WPA2 announced alongside WPA3, certified client software will be required to conform to certain behaviors surrounding AAA certificate validation.

===Hole196===
Hole196 is a vulnerability in the WPA2 protocol that abuses the shared Group Temporal Key (GTK). It can be used to conduct man-in-the-middle and denial-of-service attacks. However, it assumes that the attacker is already authenticated against Access Point and thus in possession of the GTK.

===Predictable Group Temporal Key (GTK)===
In 2016 it was shown that the WPA and WPA2 standards contain an insecure expository random number generator (RNG). Researchers showed that, if vendors implement the proposed RNG, an attacker is able to predict the group key (GTK) that is supposed to be randomly generated by the access point (AP). Additionally, they showed that possession of the GTK enables the attacker to inject any traffic into the network, and allowed the attacker to decrypt unicast internet traffic transmitted over the wireless network. They demonstrated their attack against an Asus RT-AC51U router that uses the MediaTek out-of-tree drivers, which generate the GTK themselves, and showed the GTK can be recovered within two minutes or less. Similarly, they demonstrated the keys generated by Broadcom access daemons running on VxWorks 5 and later can be recovered in four minutes or less, which affects, for example, certain versions of Linksys WRT54G and certain Apple AirPort Extreme models. Vendors can defend against this attack by using a secure RNG. By doing so, Hostapd running on Linux kernels is not vulnerable against this attack and thus routers running typical OpenWrt or LEDE installations do not exhibit this issue.

===KRACK attack===

In October 2017, details of the KRACK (Key Reinstallation Attack) attack on WPA2 were published. The KRACK attack is believed to affect all variants of WPA and WPA2; however, the security implications vary between implementations, depending upon how individual developers interpreted a poorly specified part of the standard. Software patches can resolve the vulnerability but are not available for all devices.
KRACK exploits a weakness in the WPA2 4-Way Handshake, a critical process for generating encryption keys. Attackers can force multiple handshakes, manipulating key resets. By intercepting the handshake, they could decrypt network traffic without cracking encryption directly. This poses a risk, especially with sensitive data transmission.

Manufacturers have released patches in response, but not all devices have received updates. Users are advised to keep their devices updated to mitigate such security risks. Regular updates are crucial for maintaining network security against evolving threats.

===Dragonblood===
The Dragonblood attacks exposed significant vulnerabilities in the Dragonfly handshake protocol used in WPA3 and EAP-pwd. These included side-channel attacks potentially revealing sensitive user information and implementation weaknesses in EAP-pwd and SAE. Concerns were also raised about the inadequate security in transitional modes supporting both WPA2 and WPA3. In response, security updates and protocol changes are being integrated into WPA3 and EAP-pwd to address these vulnerabilities and enhance overall Wi-Fi security.

===FragAttacks===
On May 11, 2021, FragAttacks, a set of new security vulnerabilities, were revealed, affecting Wi-Fi devices and enabling attackers within range to steal information or target devices. These include design flaws in the Wi-Fi standard, affecting most devices, and programming errors in Wi-Fi products, making almost all Wi-Fi products vulnerable. The vulnerabilities impact all Wi-Fi security protocols, including WPA3 and WEP. Exploiting these flaws is complex but programming errors in Wi-Fi products are easier to exploit. Despite improvements in Wi-Fi security, these findings highlight the need for continuous security analysis and updates. In response, security patches were developed, and users are advised to use HTTPS and install available updates for protection.

<doc id="422019" wikidata="Q252661" url="?curid=422019" title="White flag">
<text>White flags have had different meanings throughout history and depending on the locale.

==Contemporary use== 
The white flag is an internationally recognized protective sign of truce or ceasefire, and for negotiation. It is also used to symbolize surrender, since it is often the weaker party that requests negotiation. It is also flown on ships serving as cartels. A white flag signifies to all that an approaching negotiator is unarmed, with an intent to surrender or a desire to communicate. Persons carrying or waving a white flag are not to be fired upon, nor are they allowed to open fire. The use of the flag to request parley is included in the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907:

The improper use of the flag is forbidden by the rules of war and constitutes a war crime of perfidy. There have been numerous reported cases of such behavior in conflicts, such as combatants using white flags as a ruse to approach and attack enemy combatants, or killings of combatants attempting to surrender by carrying white flags.

===Origin===
==== First mentions before widespread, Early Imperial China and Roman Empire ====
The first mention of the usage of white flags to surrender is made during the Eastern Han dynasty (CE 25–220). In the Roman Empire, the historian Cornelius Tacitus mentions a white flag of surrender in CE 109. Before that time, Roman armies would surrender by holding their shields above their heads. 

==== Widespread adoption in the Middle Ages, the Capet Dynasty ====

During the Middle Ages and in a political environment centered on oaths, participating in another lord&#x27;s banner or standard signified changing allegiance and loyalty. Thus, armies would waive the banner of the opposite side to signal surrender.

The French Capetian dynasty utilized a prominent white banner during this period, referred to at the time as the oriflamme. As head of House Capet, Philip II adopted a single white flag as the family&#x27;s emblem, still closely identified with the Kings of France for several generations. &quot;Its very name - a derivation of &#x27;golden flame&#x27; - shows that it was intended from its inception to represent the French crown&quot;. 

This meaning is affirmed a few years later during a subsequent conflict between the French monarchy and the English throne. At the siege of Fréteval castle in 1194, the English knights defending the castle &quot;came clad in white tunics, barefoot, holding up white cloths&quot; to King Philip and his invading army to indicate their surrender. The color white, synonymous with the royal Capet flag, demonstrated the way medieval visual symbolism intertwined with feudal expressions of submission and dominance.

Through the 13th century, the precedent of utilizing white flags and banners to surrender to the French continued to proliferate after many French victories and across medieval Europe as Philip Augustus expanded the royal domain. Matthew Paris notes how during a 1231 rebellion against King Henry II of England in Wales, the princes pleading for mercy &quot;came before him bearing the king&#x27;s white banner&quot;. This correlated the white flag with signaling transition of land or rulership.

Thus, the original meaning of waving a white flag was deeply tied to feudal custom, acknowledging and pledging loyalty or sanctuary to a specific lord and his noble standard. By the later Middle Ages, however, the distinct connection of the white symbol to House Capet and French royalty diminished as it gained wider currency as a gesture indicating any general surrender or truce between opposing armies regardless of feudal loyalties. 

Through diffusion over time and across Europe, the white flag of the Capets, became divorced from a strict embodiment of Capetian suzerainty in war. Regardless of its shifting meaning, the basis of the tradition itself clearly originated in 12th century medieval France.

During the renaissance the white flag was widely used in Western Europe to indicate an intent to surrender. The color white was not used as the colors of the king of France anymore but instead to generally indicate a person was exempt from combat; heralds bore white wands, prisoners or hostages captured in battle would attach a piece of white paper to their hat or helmet, and garrisons that had surrendered and been promised safe passage would carry white batons.
Its use may have expanded across continents, e.g. Portuguese chronicler Gaspar Correia (writing in the 1550s), claims that in 1502, an Indian ruler, the Zamorin of Calicut, dispatched negotiators bearing a &quot;white cloth tied to a stick&quot;, &quot;as a sign of peace&quot;, to his enemy Vasco da Gama. In 1625, Hugo Grotius in &quot;De jure belli ac pacis&quot; (On the Law of War and Peace), one of the foundational texts in international law, recognized the white flag as a &quot;sign, to which use has given a signification&quot;; it was &quot;a tacit sign of demanding a parley, and shall be as obligatory, as if expressed by words&quot;.

==Early Islamic caliphates==
The Umayyad dynasty (661–750) used white as their symbolic color as a reminder of Muhammad&#x27;s first battle at Badr.

The Alids and the Fatimid dynasty also used white in opposition to the Abbasids, who used black as their dynastic color. For the same reason, the color white was adopted by other Shia regimes, like the Qarmatians of Bahrayn, the and the Zaydi rulers in northern Iran and Yemen.

==Ancien Régime in France==
During the period of the Ancien Régime, starting in the early 17th century, the royal standard of France became a plain white flag as a symbol of purity, sometimes covered in fleur-de-lis when in the presence of the king or bearing the ensigns of the Order of the Holy Spirit.

The white color was also used as a symbol of military command, by the commanding officer of a French army. It would be featured on a white scarf attached to the regimental flag as to recognize French units from foreign ones and avoid friendly fire incidents. The French troops fighting in the American Revolutionary War fought under the white flag.

The French Navy used a plain white ensign for ships of the line. Smaller ships might have used other standards, such as a fleur-de-lis on white field. Commerce and private ships were authorized to use their own designs to represent France, but were forbidden to fly the white ensign.

During the French Revolution, in 1794, the blue, white and red Tricolore was adopted as the official national flag. The white flag quickly became a symbol of French royalists. (The white part of the French Tricolor is itself originally derived from the old Royal flag, the tricolor having been designed when the revolution still aimed at constitutional monarchy rather than a republic; this aspect of the Tricolor was, however, soon forgotten.)

During the Bourbon Restoration, the white flag replaced the Tricolore, which by then was seen as a symbol of regicide.

It was finally abandoned in 1830, with the July Revolution, with the definitive use of the blue, white and red flag.

In 1873, an attempt to reestablish the monarchy failed when Henri of Artois, the Count of Chambord refused to accept the Tricolore. He demanded the return of the white flag before he would accept the throne, a condition that proved unacceptable.

==Flag of Antarctica==
In 1929, members of the British Australian and New Zealand Antarctic Research Expedition on RRS Discovery used white cotton sheeting to improvise a courtesy ensign (a flag used as a token of respect by vessels while in foreign waters) for a continent without a flag of its own. It is now in the National Maritime Museum in London. The white flag was used to represent Antarctica on at least two occasions on the voyage to Antarctica. On 1 August 1929, &quot;The Times&quot; noted that &quot;the ship was flying the Union Jack at her forepeak, the white Antarctic flag at the foremast, and the Australian flag at the stern.&quot;

==Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan==
The white flag was the official flag of the Taliban-ruled Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan between September 1996 and October 1997. It is sometimes used as an unofficial variant of the current flag which includes the Shahada written in black on a white field.

<text>In general, incentives are anything that persuade a person or organization to alter their behavior to produce the desired outcome. The laws of economists and of behavior state that higher incentives amount to greater levels of effort and therefore higher levels of performance. For comparison, a disincentive is something that discourages from certain actions.

==Divisions==
An incentive is a powerful tool to influence certain desired behaviors or action often adopted by governments and businesses. 
Incentives can be broadly broken down into two categories: intrinsic incentives and extrinsic incentives. Overall, both types of incentives can be powerful tools often employ to increase effort and higher performance according to the &quot;law of behavior.&quot;

Incentives are most studied in the area of personnel economics where economic analysts, such as those who take part in human resources management practices, focus on how firms make employees more motivated, through pay and career concerns, compensation and performance evaluation, to motivate employees and best achieve the firms&#x27; desired performance outcomes.

=== Intrinsic and extrinsic incentive ===
An intrinsic incentive is when a person is motivated to act in a certain way for their own personal satisfaction without seeking any external reward, nor facing any external pressure to perform the task. For instance, a singer who enjoys singing may be intrinsically motivated to spend several hours a day to improve their performance without receiving any recognition or awards from others. Often, intrinsic incentives are useful in increasing one&#x27;s empowerment, utility level, and autonomy and can reinforce employees’ work involvement and commitment.

Intrinsic incentives and extrinsic incentives are both important in driving people&#x27;s behavior. Experts believe that intrinsic incentives are stronger motivators compared to extrinsic incentives as they increase employees’ work engagement and genuine enjoyment of work. However, people&#x27;s intrinsic motivation tends to decrease when they are offered too many extrinsic rewards. In order to maintain the action, constant incentives have to be provided. This is known as the Overjustification Effect.

While both types of incentive are a fundamental concept in economics that play a crucial role in motivating behavior, the extent to which and how they influence individual may depend on varies factors. Factors to consider may include the type of activity being incentivized, the individual&#x27;s personal values and goals, and the context in which the incentive is offered. A well-designed incentive system should take into account to avoid unintended consequences and ensure that they align with the desired outcomes.

There are some parties who oppose the benefits of using extrinsic incentives and believe that they cause more harm than good. These opponents believe that the constant use of extrinsic incentives can lead to the crowding out of intrinsic incentives, which are also valuable performance motivators. When people are constantly being incentivized by external pressures, they neglect their intrinsic motives which could consequently be detrimental to their work ethic. Employees can become too comfortable with consistently gaining some reward for acting in a manner which is consistent with the interests of the firm. As a result, employees begin to believe that they deserve to earn rewards for doing certain things, not for the benefit of the firm but rather for their own benefit, which leads to them shirking if no extrinsic incentive is offered in return for high effort.

Nonetheless, incentives (both intrinsic and extrinsic) can be beneficial in altering a person&#x27;s behavior and can be effectively used and executed within many different areas of life including in the workforce, in education and within one&#x27;s personal life.

==Classification==

Classified by David Callahan, the types of incentives can be further broken down into three broad classes according to the different ways in which they motivate agents to take a particular course of actions:

==Monetary incentives==
Monetary incentives are any form of financial good given to someone to incentivize their actions and align their incentives with those of the principal who provides the monetary incentive. This is a type of extrinsic incentive and is commonly seen in the workplace. The effect of monetary incentive can be broken down into two categories: the &quot;standard direct price effect,&quot; and &quot;indirect psychological effect&quot;. These two types of monetary effect often work in opposite direction and crowd out incentivised behaviour. However, several studies have suggested that it is possible to manage the crowding-out effects by utilising a principal-agent model that incorporates nonstandard assumptions. For instance, a monetary incentive may come in the forms of profit sharing, bonuses, stock options or even paid vacation time. As such, a well-chosen monetary incentive programs can produce positive motivation and influence the productivity and output of individuals and firms.

A common monetary incentive system used by firms is performance-based pay where incentives are paid based on employees&#x27; productivity or output over a particular period of time. Some methods are commission-based where the employee, for example a salesperson, receives a payment directly correlated to their output level. Firms also pay additional wages or rewards for employees who work overtime and for their additional work above firm expectations. Expectancy theory implies that, provided employees place sufficient value on the monetary incentive to justify their extra effort and perceive that greater effort will result in better performance, such incentives can motivate employees to maintain high levels of effort and discourage shirking. This in turn increases the individual productivity of workers and the overall productivity of the firm.

Other monetary incentives are less direct, such as awarding periodic, discretionary bonuses to top performers, offering the possibility of a promotion to a higher-paying position or profit sharing for team projects. Alternatively, firms can also incentivize their employees to perform by threatening to demote or terminate them for poor performance. When employees feel that their careers are in jeopardy, they are more likely to increase their efforts.

Monetary incentives do affect the effort and average performance of employees but are likely dependent on the scope of the job and the task variables. For routine jobs such as clerical and administration jobs that are mundane, the presence of monetary incentives will encourage employees to demonstrate consistent effort of diligence when the intrinsic incentive has been exhausted. On the other hand, if the task assigned is too challenging, monetary incentives make little to no difference in increasing an employee&#x27;s contribution to work.

The effect of monetary incentives can depend on the framing of the rewards. For example, in cadaveric organ donation, funeral aids are perceived to be more ethical (particularly in showing gratitude and honoring the deceased donor) and potentially increase donation willingness than direct cash payments of the same monetary value.

==Non-monetary incentives==
Non-monetary incentives can act as an impactful reward system to employees with superior performance that is independent to predetermined targets. They refer to the use of rewards or benefits that are not directly related to money or financial compensation to motivate individuals to perform specific actions or achieve desired outcomes 

The use of non-monetary incentives is based on the recognition that individuals are motivated by a range of factors beyond financial rewards and acts as a reinforcement to encourage work engagement and productivity. Some examples of these incentives include extra paid holidays, recognition, praise, opportunity for personal or professional growth, gifts, family benefits or even work-based perks such as more interesting projects or work.

Individual may be motivated by a sense of purpose, a desire for personal fulfillment or growth, a need for social recognition or status, or other non-financial factors. By providing these types of incentives tend to boost employees&#x27; job satisfaction as they feel more appreciated for their efforts and lower turnover rates. Compared to monetary incentives, studies have shown that employees find non-monetary incentives more memorable as they are separated from normal pay and hence are more distinguishable. In addition, non-monetary incentives are known to promote long-term commitment and loyalty among employees Effective use of non-monetary incentives can positively influence employees’ perception of the company&#x27;s image as well as increase the morale of firms. Compared to monetary incentives, non-monetary incentives hold a stronger and longer-lasting influence on employees’ motivation as it results in a higher utility level. Employees with higher job satisfaction and morale were found to have better overall performance, contribution and hence higher productivity. Another advantage of non-monetary incentives that it allows a positive work culture that emphasizes cooperation, teamwork, and social responsibility.

However, non-monetary incentives also have some limitations and undesirable consequence. For instance, it can be less effective in motivating individuals who are primarily motivated by monetary incentives such as financial rewards. This may be especially true for individuals who are in low-paying jobs or who face significant financial stress or insecurity. Another concern is that non-monetary incentives may be more difficult to quantify and evaluate than monetary incentives. This may create several challenges for a firm or organisation to design and implement effective incentive programs that are aligned with their goals and objectives.

Overall, both monetary and non-monetary incentives are important tools to influence individual and organizational behavior. While monetary incentives may be more effective for some individuals or in some contexts, non-monetary incentives can be equally effective in promoting long-term commitment, fostering a positive work culture, and promoting social responsibility. Ultimately, the most effective incentive programs will likely incorporate a combination of monetary and non-monetary incentives to create a positive and comprehensive approach to motivation and performance.

==Incentives in the economic context==
The economic analysis of incentives focuses on the systems that determine the incentives needed for an agent to achieve a desired outcome dictated by the principal. Incentives can help companies link employees&#x27; rewards to their productivity. When a firm wants their employees to produce a certain amount of output, it must be prepared to offer a compensation scheme such as a monetary bonus to persuade employees to reach the target output. Compensation must achieve two goals. The first is to reduce employee turnover and retain the highest performing and most productive employees. Compensating employees can help attract workers to work harder and retain their ability. The second is to improve productivity. Compensation can not only stimulate the ability of workers to produce output, but also improve the enthusiasm of employees to work, thus promoting business development. A rise in pay variance across the firm reflects an increased demand for highly productive workers, and therefore compensation has begun shifting towards pay-for-performance. This helps employees recognize the direct relationship between their work output and their reward.

While incentive has become one of a powerful tool to motivate and influence certain behaviour or action, they can also have unintended consequences. Recent research indicated how extensive and intrinsic can come into conflict with other motivation. For example, a poorly designed incentive system can potentially lead to unintended behaviours and actions as such, individuals or companies gaming the system to earn rewards without actually achieving the desired outcomes. This is known as the &quot;principal-agent problem,&quot; where the incentives of the principal (e.g., the government or a company) do not align with the incentives of the agent (e.g., individuals or employees). This incentive conflicts can lead to adverse selection and moral hazard. A moral hazard refers to a situation in which a particular party engage in a risky behaviour because it fails to bear the full costs of that risk. On the other hand, an adverse selection occur when there is a asymmetric information between different parties. As such, adverse selection often creates an incentive for plans to inefficiently distorts benefits. As incentive can bring conflicts between parties involve, effective management plan is required to resolve incentive conflicts.

=== Misaligned incentives ===
A misaligned incentive refers to a situation where the goals of different parties involved in a particular situation such as a firm or system are not aligned and may even conflict with each other. Misaligned incentives can potentially arise in many other contexts, such as in government policies, healthcare, education, and environmental regulations. Principals within a firm want their agents to work for the principals&#x27; best interests, but agents often have different goals than the principals. Due to this problem of misaligned incentives, firms must design compensation plans to induce workers to act in the firm&#x27;s best interest and generate a level of output that maximizes the firm&#x27;s profits. The problem of asymmetric information means that the principal does not know exactly how to motivate its agents to act in the firm&#x27;s best interests. Consequently, compensation plans are difficult for firms to design. The principal-agent theory is used as the guiding framework when aligning incentives with the employee&#x27;s effort to obtain the efficient level of output for the firm. For example, a manager may want a certain level of output from an employee but does not know the capabilities of the employee in the presence of imperfect monitoring, and to achieve the best outcome, an optimal incentive scheme must be designed to motivate the worker to increase their productivity. Research shows that if a principal offers a high incentive, the agent will also recompense with a higher effort.

However, in this relationship, an informal advantage usually exists among agents over the principal. A moral hazard could be present where principals are unable to know for sure if agents are giving their all on a delegated task, and an adverse selection could exist as principals usually have insufficient knowledge on the agents’ capabilities and face difficulties in selecting the agent best suited for a task. In instances where principals have contradicting goals with the agents, agents would have an incentive to shirk and to leak information to competing principals. Self-interested agents may also want to maximize their own interest by lying or deliberately hiding information from the principal to decrease their workload.

=== Executive compensation ===

The board of directors in a company plays an important role in creating incentives for CEOs so that their best interest aligns with that of the shareholders. CEOs can be given incentives in many forms, including salary, bonuses, shares, and stock options to reward spectacular performance while penalties can be imposed for unsatisfactory performance. To ensure that the CEOs are appropriately incentivized, CEOs can be made the substantial owners of the company&#x27;s stock by the board of directors. CEOs that own a portion of the company&#x27;s stock will have an incentive to work towards the common best interest of themselves and the company shareholders. Threat to dismiss the CEOs for unsatisfactory performance can also act as an incentive to reinforce the performance of the CEOs, which can in turn maximize the company&#x27;s value. The possibility of dismissal will increase CEOs’ accountability for their own actions considering that the possible dismissal would likely lead to a poor reputation for themselves. As a result, a potential increase in work engagement and performance can be seen.

Apart from monetary incentives, non-monetary incentives also play a part in increasing the work performance of CEOs. Non-monetary incentives can be introduced in the form of benefits such as power, public acknowledgement, prestige, and title. However, some argue that non-monetary incentives are less impactful. 

=== Tournament theory ===
Tournament theory describes a framework of compensation based on an individual&#x27;s position within a firm&#x27;s hierarchy. The theory demonstrates that individuals are not promoted on the basis of their absolute performance and output, but instead based on their performance relative to other employees in the same position within the organization. &quot;Ceteris paribus&quot;, the larger the difference in compensation between one position to the next, the greater the incentive to exert more effort in order to achieve a promotion. However, that incentive is diminished as the size of the firm (and therefore the potential candidates for promotion) increases.

Firms must address the risk that a relative compensation scheme could incentivize uncooperative behavior amongst co-workers. Accordingly, firms encounter a trade-off between incentivizing workers to increase their efforts by increasing pay variance between the promoted and the unpromoted and, on the other hand, minimizing disharmony amongst co-workers by maintaining some level of pay compression.

=== Self-selection effects of incentives ===
Employees know more about their own abilities, competitiveness and risk attitudes than potential employers. Due to this asymmetric information, firms design incentives not only to enhance employees’ motivation to act in the interests of the firm and maximize their output, but also to influence the type and quality of workers that they attract. This is known as the self-selection or sorting effect of incentives. For example, empirical studies have shown that firms which implement pay-for-performance rather than fixed wage compensation schemes tend to attract more productive workers who are less risk averse. Greater risk aversion reduces workers&#x27; willingness to work for variable as opposed to fixed pay. Accordingly, firms may use incentives as a method of filtering out low productivity workers or workers who lack the personal characteristics that those firms are searching for.

=== Team-based incentives ===
Production is increasingly organized around teams in many large firms. Teamwork may enhance company productivity for firms that encounter multidimensional, complex problems. A firm may be able to solve a complex task which requires a high level of various different skills by assigning it to expert workers with complementary skills. Due to constantly advancing technologies, seldom does an individual employee have an absolute advantage across all skills that are required to solve the complicated problems that firms face, hence team collaboration is crucial and beneficial to ensure the success of a team.

Individualized incentives are said to be dysfunctional in an interdependent working environment where individual performance is difficult to observe and so firms may opt for team-based incentives instead. Team-based incentive refers to the incentive system that rewards employees based on performance of the team. Team-based incentives are described as more beneficial to companies than individual-based incentives. By paying a straight piece rate to individual employees, they would have little to no motivation to help each other as the incentives they receive are irrespective of the result of others. On the other hand, paying team incentives based on team output can promote cohesiveness, trust, cooperation, and support within a team. Researchers found a positive relationship between team-based incentive and employees’ work efficacy, stability, and salary as well as company output.

Research shows that employees prefer individual-based incentives over team-based incentives due to a few reasons. Firstly, they believe that team-based incentives are prone to unfairness. Employees with more contributions may be discouraged from seeing employees that contributed less receiving the same level of incentive. Moreover, as a team expands and the effect of team incentives weakens, employees struggle to establish a clear link between effort given and incentives received. It is also inevitable that team incentives could induce the free-rider problem because an employee&#x27;s motivation to maximize their individual output could be diminished. Managers may need to offer a team incentive that is strong enough to ensure that each worker&#x27;s individual payoff from exerting the level of effort that allows the company to maximize its profits is greater than their individual payoff from free riding on the efforts of other team members.

Using Game theory to illustrate this, firms need to implement a team-based incentive that results in the value of ‘Y’ in Game 1 being greater than 100 and enforce a punishment for free-riding that makes the value of ‘X’ less than 40. This would ensure that both team members’ dominant strategy in Game 1 is to work hard and the Nash equilibrium is (Work Hard, Work Hard).

In contrast, some studies have shown that peer pressure and employees’ intrinsic incentive to perform well in a team environment may mitigate the free-rider problem associated with team-based incentives. Such case studies demonstrate that team incentives increase firm productivity in settings that involve complex, interdependent production where peer pressure and intrinsic incentives outweigh selfish preferences. Peer rating system can also be introduced for team members to rate each other&#x27;s contribution to a task. Research findings show that imposing a penalty on free riders is useful in decreasing the tendency of free riding.

===Potential issues associated with the use of incentives in firms===

==== Ratchet effect ====
Incentives are arguably beneficial in increasing productivity, however, they can also have an adverse effect on the firm. This is evident through the ratchet effect. A firm may use its observation of an employee&#x27;s output level when they are first employed as a guide to set performance standard and objectives for the future. Knowing this, an employee may deliberately reduce their output level when first employed or hide their ability to produce at a higher output with the intent of exploiting being rewarded in the future when they strategically increase their output level. Best performances of employees can be limited from it. Thus, the ratchet effect can significantly diminish production levels of a firm and planned economies.

==== Crowding-out effect ====
Additionally, in the 1970s psychologists began exploring the relationship between extrinsic and intrinsic motivation whilst economists were simultaneously studying the &quot;crowding-out&quot; effects of monetary incentives. This came as a result of Richard Titmuss&#x27; 1970 publication, &quot;The Gift Relationship&quot;, which explained how the constant use of extrinsic incentives can result in conflict with intrinsic motivators and lead to the desired behavior being &quot;crowded out&quot;. In his publication, Titmuss argued that the use of monetary incentives was disrupting social norms around the idea of voluntary contribution and would ultimately have a crowding-out effect. He acknowledged that if the incentives are large enough, they are more likely to offset crowding-out effects (at least in the short run while the incentives are being offered). However, Titmuss noted that making the incentives too large could also have an adverse effect due to the possibility of negative inferences being drawn from the size of the incentives. Crowding-out effects can also occur when temporary incentives are removed in the long run. In the workplace, the complete removal of extrinsic incentives can result in employee effort levels being lower than they were when the incentives were offered, thereby hindering motivation and performance.

==== Stock options ====
Incentives are not always effective at aligning employees&#x27; incentives with those of the firm. For example, some corporate policies popular during the 1990s aimed to encourage productivity have led to failures as a result of unintended consequences. Moreover, providing stock options was intended to boost CEO productivity through offering a remunerative incentive to align the CEOs&#x27; interests with those of the shareholders to improve company performance. However, CEOs were found to either make good decisions which resulted in a reward of a long-term price increase of the stock, or were found to have fabricated the accounting information to give the illusion of economic success and to retain their incentive-based pay. Furthermore, it has been found to be extremely costly for firms to incentivize CEOs with stock options. Nevertheless, firms are forced to pay substantial amounts of money to ensure that CEOs act in the best interest of the firms.

==== Conflicts generated by pay variance ====
Incentives can have a bipolar effect on the company.
On the one hand, the company&#x27;s incentives to employees may create a pay gap. For example, low-paid employees may reduce their production or contribution to the company. Low-paid employees and high-paid employees may not be able to communicate and cooperate effectively, causing low-paid employees to gradually lose their enthusiasm for work. Firms should provide a fair amount of incentives for both low-paid and other employees, incentives for low-paid workers can be breaks rather than monetary incentives. Motivating employees with financial rewards may make a difference. That&#x27;s because if the company is profitable in the first year, it may have plenty of bonuses to hand out to employees. However, if the company makes less money in the second year than it did in the first year, the company may not be able to give employees the same bonuses as in the first year even though they put in the same effort. This also reduces employees&#x27; motivation to work. Therefore, incentives may be counterproductive. Firm can provide other types of incentives rather than monetary incentives, such as promotion or vacation breaks for high-performing employees.

== Incentives in the context of voluntary contributions ==
When it comes to volunteering activities, monetary incentives can bring negative effects. According to the Self-perception theory, humans constantly seek explanations for their behavior. When individuals are involved in volunteering activities, they most likely perceive themselves as prosocial and altruistic, and attach a symbolic price to the act of volunteering. When a monetary reward is attached to an otherwise prosocial activity such as volunteering, people may perceive that their originally altruistic actions are now linked to extrinsic incentives, causing their self-image benefit and prosocial motivation to decrease. A crowding-out effect leads to a decrease in individuals’ desire to volunteer and people eventually stop contributing due to the rewards attached. For example, if monetary incentives are offered for voluntary blood donation, it will have a negative effect on the number of people donating blood.

== Incentives in education ==
Extrinsic incentives offered to unmotivated students can potentially have positive short-run effects on education. However, the use of extrinsic incentives in education has been opposed on the basis that they are morally corrupt and have the potential to crowd out intrinsic incentives for educational effort. Furthermore, there is scarce empirical evidence to support the success of monetary incentives awarded for educational &quot;outputs&quot; such as academic achievement as opposed to educational &quot;inputs&quot; such as attendance and enrolment.

The dynamic effects of incentives are evident in the context of education. Studies have demonstrated that the impact of monetary incentives is dependent on previous academic performance and individual ability. Monetary incentives tend to improve the academic results of high-ability students but have an adverse effect on the performance of students with lower aptitude.

== Conclusion ==
Ultimately, there is always potential for conflicts to arise, both in the short and in the long run, during the application of incentives in different areas, as incentives that seek to change behaviors can crowd-out intrinsic motivators. A growing pool of evidence suggests that economists must broaden their focus when exploring the effects of incentives as the effect they have is largely dependent on how they are designed and specifically how they interact with intrinsic and social motivators in the short run and the long run.

<text>Lev Lvovich Sedov (, also known as Leon Sedov; 24 February 1906 – 16 February 1938) was the first son of Soviet communist leader Leon Trotsky and his second wife, Natalia Sedova. He was born when his father was in prison facing life imprisonment for participating in the Revolution of 1905.

==Life==
He lived separately from his parents after the October Revolution to avoid being seen as privileged. He married in 1925 at the age of 19 and had a son, Lev, the following year. Sedov supported his father in the struggle against Joseph Stalin and became a leader of the Trotskyist movement in his own right.

===Exile in Turkey and Germany===
He accompanied his parents into exile in 1929, and then in 1931 he moved to Berlin to study. Alexandra Ramm-Pfemfert and her husband, Franz Pfemfert, arranged his visa and ensured that he saw an eye specialist to treat an eye disease he was suffering from. Carl Sternheim, a friend of the Pfemferts, met him during this period and described him as an extremely nice looking young man with light brown hair and blue eyes but who chain smokes and vividly explains that he goes through fifty of them every day&quot;. During this period Sedov spoke little German but was fluent in French. During this time he also assisted with printing and distributing the Russian-language &quot;Bulletin of the Opposition&quot; before becoming an editor and writer for it.

==== Trotsky&#x27;s bloc ====
In 1932, he helped Trotsky create a political bloc with the anti-Stalin opposition inside the USSR and was in contact with some of its members like Ivan Smirnov, through the old bolshevik Eduard Holtzman, whom he called in his letters &quot;the informant&quot;. Sedov showed he was far more interested in using a direct aggressive policy than Trotsky, stating: &quot;Before everything else we have to drive out the present leadership and get rid of Stalin nothing but their liquidation can bring victory&quot;. The bloc was dissolved in early 1933, according to Pierre Broué.

===Exile in Paris===
Just before Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, Sedov moved to Paris, where he worked as a Parisian laborer and became an important activist in the Trotskyist movement. He was frequently followed by agents of the Soviet NKVD. Between 1935 and 1938, while in Paris, Sedov and his partner, Jeanne Martin, took in and cared for his young nephew, Vsevolod Volkov, called &quot;Sieva&quot; by the family (and who later, in Mexico, took the name Esteban Volkov), the son of Sedov&#x27;s late half-sister, Zina.

==Death==
After an acute attack of appendicitis in February 1938, Mark Zborowski, an NKVD agent who had posed as Sedov&#x27;s comrade and friend, arranged to take him to a private clinic instead of a Paris hospital. At the same time, Zborowski notified the NKVD that Sedov had been transported under an assumed name to the Clinique Mirabeau, which was operated by a White Russian with connections to Soviet intelligence, who performed an appendectomy. Complications set in after the operation, but Sedov apparently received no further treatment. He was later taken to a Paris hospital, where he died.

Some historians who have analyzed the matter believe Sedov was murdered by agents of Stalin who were in Paris watching him, either while in hospital or by poisoning him, causing his condition. In 1994, Pavel Sudoplatov, a lieutenant general in the NKVD who at that time was in charge of planning assassinations abroad, including the one of Sedov&#x27;s father, claimed in his memoirs, &quot;Special Tasks&quot;, that Soviet agents played no part in his death. In 1956, Zborowski had testified before a United States Senate subcommittee that he had contacted the NKVD to report that Sedov had entered the clinic, and then to confirm his death.

Sedov&#x27;s grave is in Cimetière de Thiais, south of Paris.

==Writings==
Lev Sedov&#x27;s major political work is &quot;The Red Book on the Moscow Trials&quot; (1936). At a time that a leftist consensus accepted the verdicts of the Moscow trials, the book analyzed them with the aim of discrediting them. It was the first thorough-going exposé of the frame-ups upon which the trials were based. Trotsky himself described it as a &quot;priceless gift... the first crushing reply to the Kremlin falsifiers&quot;.

<text>A leper colony, also known by many other names, is an isolated community for the quarantining and treatment of lepers, people suffering from leprosy.

&quot;M. leprae&quot;, the bacterium responsible for leprosy, is believed to have spread from East Africa through the Near East, Europe, and Asia by the 5th century before reaching the rest of the world more recently. Historically, leprosy was believed to be extremely contagious and divinely ordained, leading to enormous stigma against its sufferers. Other severe skin diseases were frequently conflated with leprosy and all such sufferers were kept away from the general public, although some religious orders provided medical care and treatment. Recent research has shown &quot;M. leprae&quot; has maintained a similarly virulent genome over at least the last thousand years, leaving it unclear which precise factors led to leprosy&#x27;s near elimination in Europe by 1700. A growing number of cases following the first wave of European colonization, however, led to increased attention towards leprosy during the New Imperialism of the late 19th century. Following G.A. Hansen&#x27;s discovery of the role of &quot;M. leprae&quot; in the disease, the First International Leprosy Conference held in Berlin in 1897 renewed interest and investment in the isolation of lepers throughout the European colonial empires. 

The development of modern treatments eliminated the need to isolate lepers as early as the 1940s; scientific arguments against the practice were made in the 1980s. Although Western countries now generally treat cases of leprosy individually on an outpatient basis, traditional isolated colonies continue to exist in India, China, and some other countries.

==Names==
In medieval Latin, a place for the isolation and care of lepers was known as a leprosaria, leprosarium, or leprosorium, names which are sometimes used in English as well. The Latin was calqued in English as , with becoming by far the most common English term in the 1880s as the growing number of leprosy cases were discussed within the context of European colonialism. Less common synonyms include leper asylum, leper lodge, and leper hospital. Other names derive from the figure of Lazarus in one of Jesus&#x27;s parables, treated by the Catholic Church during the Middle Ages as a historical figure and as the patron saint of both lepers and the Crusader Order of Saint Lazarus, who administered the leper colony in Jerusalem before spreading to other locations. This caused leper colonies to also be known as and, after the leper colony and quarantine center on Venice&#x27;s Sta. Maria di Nazareth, as lazarets, lazarettes, lazarettos, and lazarettas. The name leper or is sometimes used for colonies in China, a calque of the Mandarin name &quot;máfēngcūn&quot; 

==History==


Although not all of the skin diseases (&quot;kushtha&quot;) discussed in the Indian Vedas and the Laws of Manu were leprosy, some of them seem to have been, with the disease appearing in the subcontinent by at least 2000. The Indian religious texts and laws did not organize formal leper colonies but treated those afflicted with the disease as untouchable outcastes, forbidding and punishing any marriage with them while they suffered from the disease, which was considered both contagious and a divine punishment for sins of the sufferer&#x27;s current or former life. In legend, even kings were removed from power and left to wander in the forests while suffering from leprosy, although their position could be restored in the event of their recovery, whether through divine intervention or Ayurvedic herbal remedies such as chaulmoogra oil. Similarly, the ancient Persians and Hebrews considered certain skin diseases to render people unclean and unfit for society, without organizing any special locations for their care; it seems likely, however, that the references to &quot;leprosy&quot; in the Old and New Testaments of the Bible are the result of a misunderstanding produced by the Septuagint&#x27;s Greek translation and subsequent Latin translations like the Vulgate and originally referred to a variety of conditions such as psoriasis before becoming associated with leprosy centuries later. This confusion of termsand the related divine opprobriumwas then translated into Islamic medicine in the 9th century. The introduction of leprosy to southern Europe was blamed on the armies of Alexander and Pompey; ancient Greek and Roman doctors did not blame divine punishment and advocated various treatments but still usually advised that lepers be kept out of cities. Some early Christians sought to emulate Jesus&#x27;s example by personally ministering to lepers or communities of lepers, activity recorded in hagiographies like StGregory&#x27;s life of StBasil.

Leprosy seems to have reached the rest of Europe during late Antiquity and the early Middle Ages, with the imperial Church reducing formal restrictions on lepers while setting aside funds for leprosaria where clerics would treat the afflicted. Such leper houses are documented at St-Oyen in 460, Chalon-sur-Saône in 570, and Verdun in 634; their management was often provided by monastic orders. The area of modern Belgium alone may have had as many as 700 or 800 prior to the Crusades. Christian folklore misunderstood the parable of Lazarus and Dives as a historical account and took the sore-covered beggar in the story as StLazarus, patron of lepers; the military order StLazarus was established to care for lepers in Crusader Jerusalem and subsequently operated other leprosaria around Europe. Some colonies were located on mountains or in remote locations to ensure isolation, some on main roads, where donations would be made for their upkeep. Others were essentially hospitals within major cities. In 1623 the Congregation of the Mission, a Catholic society of apostolic life founded by Vincent de Paul, was given possession of the Priory of St. Lazarus, a former leper house in Paris, due to which the entire Congregation gained the name of &quot;Lazarites&quot; or &quot;Lazarists&quot; although most of its members had nothing to do with caring for lepers.

Debate exists over the conditions found within historical colonies; while they are currently thought to have been grim and neglected places, there are some indications that life within a leper colony or house was no worse than the life of other, non-isolated individuals. There is even doubt that the current definition of leprosy can be retrospectively applied to the medieval condition. What was classified as leprosy then covers a wide range of skin conditions that would be classified as distinct afflictions today. Some leper colonies issued their own money or tokens, in the belief that allowing people affected by leprosy to handle regular money could spread the disease. Today leper hospitals exist throughout the world to treat those afflicted with leprosy, especially in Africa, Brazil, China and India.

== Political aspects ==
In 2001, government-run leper colonies in Japan came under judicial scrutiny, leading to the determination that the Japanese government had mistreated the patients, and the district court ordered Japan to pay compensation to former patients. In 2002, a formal inquiry into these colonies was set up, and in March 2005, the policy was strongly denounced. &quot;Japan&#x27;s policy of absolute quarantine... did not have any scientific grounds.&quot; The inquiry denounced not only the government and the doctors who were involved with the policy, but also the court that repeatedly ruled in favor of the government when the policy was challenged, as well as the media, which failed to report the plight of the victims.

<text>Emperor Kang of Jin (; late 322 – 17 November 344), personal name Sima Yue (), courtesy name Shitong (), was an emperor of the Eastern Jin dynasty (266–420). He was a son of Emperor Ming and a full younger brother of Emperor Cheng. He was backed by his uncles, Yu Bing and Yu Yi to the throne, but only reigned for two years and was succeeded by his infant son Sima Dan (posthumously known as Emperor Mu of Jin).

==Prior to reign==
Sima Yue was born in 322 as the second son of Emperor Ming, by his wife Empress Yu Wenjun. After his father died in October 325 and was succeeded by his brother Emperor Cheng, Sima Yue was created the Prince of Wu in 326. In 327, because his uncle Sima Yu the Prince of Langya wanted to yield that more honorific title, Sima Yu was created the Prince of Kuaiji and Sima Yue was created the Prince of Langya. It is not known where Sima Yue was during the Su Jun Disturbance of 326–328—whether he was captured and held hostage like his emperor brother, at his principality of Wu (which Su Jun did not occupy), or elsewhere. During his brother&#x27;s reign, he received a progression of offices, but did not appear to actually participate in major decision-making.

In summer 342, Emperor Cheng grew gravely ill. He had two young sons -- Sima Pi and Sima Yi, then still in cradles, by his concubine Consort Zhou. Yu Bing (), one of the top two officials and Emperor Cheng&#x27;s (and Sima Yue&#x27;s) uncle, fearful that the Yu clan would lose power if a young emperor were named, persuaded Emperor Cheng that in the face of the powerful enemy Later Zhao, an older emperor should be named. Emperor Cheng agreed and designated Sima Yue the Prince of Langya, despite the other top official He Chong ()&#x27;s opposition. He died soon after, and Sima Yue took the throne as Emperor Kang. He Chong did not make secret his opposition; after Emperor Kang took the throne, when he thanked Yu and He for making him emperor, He stated, &quot;The reason why Your Imperial Majesty can fly like a dragon is Yu Bing. If I were listened to, we would not have this current prosperous reign.&quot; Emperor Kang appeared humiliated, but did not retaliate against He (although He himself would request to become a local governor to avoid working with Yu Bing, and his request was granted) and continued to respect him.

==Reign==
In early 343, Emperor Kang created his wife Chu Suanzi empress.

Later in 343, Emperor Kang&#x27;s other uncle, Yu Yi (), proposed a major military campaign against Later Zhao, in coordination with Former Yan&#x27;s ruler Murong Huang and Former Liang&#x27;s ruler Zhang Jun, both nominal Jin vassals. Most officials feared this large undertaking, but with support from Yu Bing, Huan Wen (Emperor Kang&#x27;s brother-in-law, having married his sister Sima Xingnan () the Princess Nankang), and Sima Wuji () the Prince of Qiao, Emperor Kang approved the plan and mobilized troops. Yu Bing was made a governor to coordinate with Yu Yi, and He Chong was recalled to replace him, and served in conjunction with Emperor Kang&#x27;s father-in-law Chu Pou () (who, however, soon yielded his post). However, Yu Yi eventually, for reasons unknown, largely did not carry out his campaign, although he made some border attacks.

In fall 344, Emperor Kang grew ill. Yu Bing and Yu Yi wanted to support his uncle Sima Yu the Prince of Kuaiji as emperor, but He Chong, consistent with his prior advice to Emperor Cheng, suggested that Emperor Kang should pass the throne to his son Sima Dan. Emperor Kang agreed and created Sima Dan crown prince. He died two days later, and was succeeded by the one-year-old Crown Prince Dan (as Emperor Mu).

<text>Vigo (, ; ) is a city and municipality in the province of Pontevedra, within the autonomous community of Galicia, Spain. Located in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula, it sits on the southern shore of an inlet of the Atlantic Ocean, the Ria de Vigo, the southernmost of the Rías Baixas. It is the capital of the comarca of Vigo.

The municipality, with an area of and a population of 292,374 in 2022 including rural parishes, is the most populous municipality in Galicia. The area of the municipality includes the Cíes Islands, part of the Atlantic Islands of Galicia National Park.

Vigo is one of the region&#x27;s primary economic agents, owing to the French Stellantis Vigo Plant and to its port. Close to the Portugal–Spain border, Vigo is part of the Galicia–North Portugal Euroregion. The European Fisheries Control Agency is headquartered in Vigo.

==History==
In the Early Middle Ages, the small village of Vigo was part of the territory of Galician-speaking neighbouring towns, particularly Tui, and suffered several Viking attacks. However, its number of inhabitants was so small that, historically, it was not considered a real town until around the 15th century, when the earliest records began.

In the 16th and 17th centuries, the city was attacked several times. In 1585 and 1589, during an unsuccessful attack by the English counter-Armada, Francis Drake raided the city and temporarily occupied it, burning many buildings. Several decades later a Turkish fleet tried to attack the city. As a result, the city&#x27;s walls were built in 1656 in the reign of Philip IV of Spain. They are still partially preserved.
At this time, and in spite of the attacks, Vigo developed its earliest commerce and was given several privileges by the kings of Spain.

In 1702, the Battle of Vigo Bay occurred, and in 1719, because a Spanish fleet which departed from Vigo attempted to invade Scotland in support of the Jacobites, the city was occupied for ten days by a British force.

In 1808, the French Army annexed Spain to the Napoleonic Empire, although Vigo remained unconquered until January, 1809. Vigo was also the first city of Europe to be freed from French rule, in what is annually celebrated on March 28 as the &quot;Reconquista&quot; (reconquest from the French in the context of the Peninsular War). In 1833, the city of Pontevedra was designated the provincial capital of the province of Pontevedra, within which lies Vigo.

Vigo grew very rapidly in the 20th century, thanks to the fact that the Spanish government granted it a free trade zone in 1947 to encourage international trade and economic development in southern Galicia. 
==Toponym==

Vigo&#x27;s urban area is built on both a hill-fort (&quot;Castro&quot;) and a Roman settlement. It is generally accepted that the name Vigo is derived from the Latin word &quot; spacorum&quot;, meaning &quot;small village&quot;.

The standard pronunciation of Vigo in both Galician and Spanish is .

Vigo has been given the nickname &quot;cidade olívica&quot; (city of olives). It is said that, after the conflict between Isabel de Castilla and Juana la Beltraneja - where Galician nobility fought for the latter - the victor ordered all of Galicia&#x27;s olive trees to be cut down, as they symbolized peace. The tree in Vigo however, could not be uprooted as it was planted in sacred ground. The tree is represented in the city seal, and a descendant of it is still alive in Vigo&#x27;s city centre.

==Geography==
=== Location ===
To the northeast, Vigo borders the municipality of Redondela; to the east, Mos; to the south, O Porriño and Gondomar; and to the southwest, Nigrán. On the other side of the bay are the municipalities of Cangas and Moaña.

===Climate===

Vigo has a transitional climate between the oceanic climate &quot;&quot;Cfb&quot; and the warm-summer Mediterranean climate &quot;Csb&quot;&quot; according to the Köppen climate classification. Although Vigo is the rainiest city in Galicia, with its noticeable drying trend in the summer, Vigo&#x27;s climate is more similar to the variant of the oceanic climate commonly seen in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. The all-time record high for the city is set on August 7, 2016. Vigo is known for its extreme rainfall in winter. December 1978 saw fall at the weather station in a single month. During that month on 7 December, fell on a single day. Normal values for 1991-2020 was falling on just 126 days indicating heavy rain to be common. The airport where values are taken is located further inland at a considerably higher elevation () than the city itself located on the coastline in the Ria de Vigo estuary, which is likely warmer year-round.
==Demographics==

The municipality of Vigo had 293,642 inhabitants in 2018 (198,537 in the city) with an extended metropolitan population of 545,892 in the southern part of the province of Pontevedra making it Spain&#x27;s 14th-largest metropolitan area.

In 2021 - according to the data provided by the INE on 1 January 2021 - it had a population of 545,892 inhabitants in total, of which 296,692 lived in the municipality of Vigo, which represented 54.34% of the total population of the metropolitan area.

In 2019, 15,319 foreigners lived in the city, 5.2% of the total population. The main nationalities are Portuguese (12%), Venezuelans (9.2%), Brazilians (9%), Romanians (7.5%), Colombians (6.5%), Senegalese (4%) and Chinese people (3%).

By language, according to 2013 data, 7.68% of the population spoke exclusively in Galician, and 51.39% in Spanish; 11.38% spoke in Galician more often than Spanish, and 29.55% more often in Spanish than Galician. This made Vigo the least Galician-speaking city in Galicia.

The creation of Vigo metropolitan area was approved in 2016 and, in addition to Vigo, it originally accounted for the following 13 municipalities: Baiona, Cangas, Fornelos de Montes, Gondomar, Moaña, Mos, Nigrán, Pazos de Borbén, O Porriño, Redondela, Salceda de Caselas, Salvaterra de Miño and Soutomaior. It has been however suspended since its creation. The European Union&#x27;s Directorate-General for Regional and Urban Policy assigns Vigo a wider functional urban area (FUA), with 21 municipalities and a population of 541,000 inhabitants.
== Government and administration ==

Vigo is a municipality, the basic level of local government in Spain. The Ayuntamiento (&quot;concello&quot; in Galician) is the body charged with the municipal government and administration. The Plenary of the &quot;concello&quot; is formed by 27 elected municipal councillors, who in turn invest the mayor.

The last municipal election took place on 26 May 2019, leading to a plenary formed by 20 councillors from the Socialists&#x27; Party of Galicia–PSOE, 4 from the People&#x27;s Party, 2 from the Marea de Vigo and 1 from the Galician Nationalist Bloc. The current mayor is Abel Caballero (Spanish Socialist Workers Party), who has won four mandates in a row since becoming mayor in 2007.

==Economy==

Vigo is characterized by a diversified economy linked to the fishing sector, industry, trade, tourism and services. It is often considered with A Coruña one of the economic and industrial engines of Galicia.

=== Fishing sector ===
Vigo is the home port of many of the world&#x27;s largest fishing companies, such as Pescanova and Iberconsa and the most important centre of the Galician canned and processed fish industries.

The fishing sector in Vigo generates more than 32,000 direct and indirect jobs and a turnover of more than 1 billion euros per year. More than 660 fishing vessels are registered in the port of Vigo, making it one of the main ports for the marketing of fresh fish for human consumption in the world, with around 800,000 tonnes per year.

Vigo regularly hosts congresses and trade fairs related to industrial fishing, such as the World Tuna Conference (biannually), Conxemar (annually), or the World Fishing Exhibition (which was held periodically from 1973 to 2009).

Vigo is home of the European Fisheries Control Agency.

=== Industry ===
Vigo is one of the leading industrial areas in Galicia, with a car factory, shipyards, and auxiliary industry in both automotive and marine sectors. Situated in Vigo since 1958, the Stellantis Plant is one of the largest employers in the region. In 2007, it produced a total of 545,000 vehicles, of which more than 82% were sold outside Spain. Biotech and other advanced industries play an important role on Vigo&#x27;s economy.

The publishing industry in Galician is prominent in the city, with Editorial Galaxia and Editorial Xerais.

=== Port of Vigo ===
The Port of Vigo covers a length of more than 20 km and offers more than 9 km of docks. The largest port traffic is general freight, highlighting container traffic, RO-RO of vehicles (the second in Spain in Ro-Ro traffic for new vehicles), natural stone and granite (the first of Spain in granite traffic), wood and preserved food.

==Education==
The main campus of the University of Vigo is located on top of one of the mountains that surrounds the town, in the parish of Zamáns. The local transportation service Vitrasa enables shuttles in order to communicate the campus with the town. The majority of the students of the university come from Vigo itself and from other towns and villages in Galicia and can choose from a wide range of studies, with a focus on ocean studies and engineering.

The University of Vigo was founded in 1990 as split from the University of Santiago de Compostela and has two additional campuses located in Pontevedra and Ourense. The Zamáns Campus features several buildings that constitute excellent examples of modern architecture that blends in with the shape of the mountain in which it is located. These buildings were projected by the likes of Enric Miralles, Alfonso Penelas, Pilar Díez y Alberto Noguerol César Portela, Gabriel Santos Zas and César Padrón.

== Culture ==

===Language===
Vigo, as a Galician city, has two official languages: Galician and Spanish, the latter being the most used nowadays.

===Music===
&quot;A movida viguesa&quot; was a hedonistic cultural movement akin to the &quot;Movida madrileña&quot; that took place in Vigo during the 1980s triggered by the explosion of liberties after the death of dictator Francisco Franco. The most important artists of this postmodern movement were musicians; particularly punk and new wave bands such as &quot;Siniestro Total&quot;, &quot;Golpes Bajos&quot;, &quot;Aerolíneas Federales&quot;, &quot;Semen Up&quot; or &quot;Os Resentidos&quot;.

At the moment, the city still has notorious bands like Iván Ferreiro (ex-singer of Los Piratas) and Mon.

===Media and entertainment===

Vigo has two daily newspapers; the &quot;Faro de Vigo&quot;, the oldest newspaper in Spain still in circulation, and the &quot;Atlántico Diario&quot;, a little local newspaper. There also exist a local edition of the Galician main headline newspaper &quot;La Voz de Galicia&quot;. Vigo was also the main location of historic newspaper such as the weekly newspaper &quot;A Nosa Terra&quot;, which was published in Galician and is now defunct.

Vigo also has a TV local station: &quot;Televigo&quot;. Although not very popular, it is known thanks to the town mayor, Abel Caballero, who has a show in which he answers to questions and inquiries submitted by the citizens.

Radio coverage includes RNE —the Spanish public radio network—, Radio Galega —a Galician government-supported radio in Galician language—, and some private-owned stations (&quot;Radio Vigo - Cadena Ser&quot;, &quot;Radio Voz Vigo&quot;, &quot;Radio ECCA&quot;, and so on).

Around the 2000s, several online news websites emerged (for example, &quot;riadevigo.com&quot;) besides of the traditional media homepages. Vigo also participated in the Europeanwide free newspapers rush led by &quot;Metro&quot; and some free journals were published in the 1990s and 2000s: &quot;20 minutos&quot;, &quot;Gaceta Universitaria&quot;, &quot;Redacción Xove&quot;, etcetera. &quot;España Exterior&quot; is also printed in Vigo.

The locally produced award-winning feature movie &quot;Mondays In The Sun&quot; (original title &quot;Los lunes al sol&quot;) depicts the life of several men who have lost their work at the Port of Vigo. This film is not based on a single individual&#x27;s experiences but on the perceived collective experiences of many local port workers.

===Sports===

Vigo has one of the most important women&#x27;s basketball team in Spain, Celta, more commonly referred to today by its sponsorship name of Celta Indepo. They usually compete in the top league of women&#x27;s basketball, having won the championship three times. For the season 2012–2013, and following a number of economic problems, the team will play in the Spanish women basketball second division.

Vigo has a football team, Real Club Celta de Vigo, which as of 2023–24, plays in La Liga. The women&#x27;s team from the area, Federación Viguesa de Peñas Recreativas El Olivo, was the first team from Galicia to compete in the Women&#x27;s Primera División.

The &quot;Rías Baixas&quot; offer an excellent environment for nautical sports. Institutions such as the &quot;Real Club Nautico de Vigo&quot; (RCNV), founded in 1906, and the Liceo Marítimo de Bouzas (LMB), founded in 1907, are good examples of promotion of the nautical sports, especially sailing.
The RCNV organises important events like Atlantic Week, which in September 2006 included the World Championship of the Platu 25 class. Every August, the RCNV also organises one of the largest sailboat races in the Iberian peninsula: the &quot;Regata Rías Baixas&quot;. In 2006 more than 130 different boats participated.

The Liceo Maritimo de Bouzas (LMB) is a yacht club which counts around 400 associates. The LMB has a long and intense history of sailing and recreational fishing. The LMB organizes two important regattas in the Galician sailing calendar: the &quot;Regata Vila de Bouzas&quot; and a &quot;Regata de Solitarios y a Dos&quot;.

The &quot;Regata Vila de Bouzas&quot; honours the neighbourhood where the LMB is located. The &quot;Regata de Solitarios y a Dos&quot; is for crews of one and two members. It is a difficult race with two stages; the first consists of a race through the coastal bay of Vigo while the second stage is a longer race around the Cies Islands (and/or Ons Islands).

*Vigo Bay is one of the settings for Jules Verne&#x27;s 1870 novel &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot;. The book&#x27;s protagonist, Captain Nemo, draws his wealth and the funding for his submarine &quot;Nautilus&quot; from the cargoes of the galleons sunk by the British during the Battle of Vigo Bay in 1702. They are depicted as still having their treasure and as being easily accessible to divers.
*In the novel and the movie &quot;Das Boot&quot;, set during World War II, the German submarine &quot;U-96&quot; stops in Vigo under cover of darkness to resupply (in secret, as Spain is neutral) from a German cargo ship stationed there for this purpose.

<text>Kreon is a fictional character featured in comic books published by DC Comics, primarily in association with the Green Lantern Corps. He first appeared in &quot;Green Lantern&quot; (vol. 3) #22 (March 1992).

==Fictional character biography==
Kreon is a Teban warlord who previously lost an arm and eye in combat and now seeks to end wars rather than start them, in contrast to his militaristic species. He recruits Star Sapphire, who kills over a dozen men before being subdued. Kreon is shunned by his fellow Chieftains, but Hal Jordan sees potential in him and recruits him into the Green Lantern Corps.

Kreon comes into conflict with fellow trainee Boodikka, who he views as barbaric and lacking in discipline. However, the two come to respect one another after Kilowog forces them to face psychic manifestations of their fears.

Later, Kreon is among several Lanterns kidnapped by the Manhunters. He is killed battling them, after which Boodikka inherits his ring.

In &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, Kreon is temporarily resurrected as a Black Lantern.

== In other media ==
Kreon appears as a character summon in &quot;Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure&quot;.
