<doc id="416452" wikidata="Q1283193" url="?curid=416452" title="List of United States senators from South Carolina">
<text>South Carolina ratified the United States Constitution on May 23, 1788. Its Senate seats were declared vacant in July 1861 owing to its secession from the Union. They were again filled from July 1868. The state&#x27;s current U.S. senators are Republicans Lindsey Graham, serving since 2003, and Tim Scott, serving since 2013. Strom Thurmond was the state&#x27;s longest-serving senator (1954–1956, 1956–2003).

<doc id="416453" wikidata="Q499049" url="?curid=416453" title="List of United States senators from South Dakota">
<text>South Dakota was admitted to the Union on November 2, 1889, and elects U.S. senators to class 2 and class 3. Its current U.S. senators are Republicans John Thune (since 2005) and Mike Rounds (since 2015). Karl E. Mundt is South Dakota&#x27;s longest-serving senator (1948–1973). South Dakota is one of 15 states alongside California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Utah to have a younger senior senator and an older junior senator. South Dakota&#x27;s class 3 seat also holds the distinction of having a future Senate Majority Leader (John Thune) defeat and succeed a former Majority Leader (Tom Daschle).

<text>YTV (stylized as yTV) is a Canadian English language discretionary specialty channel owned by YTV Canada, Inc. a subsidiary of Corus Entertainment. The channel and its programming is targeted at children and young teenagers. Its name was originally thought to be an abbreviation for &quot;Youth Television&quot;, though the channel&#x27;s website has denied this.

The channel was launched on September 1, 1988 by owners Rogers Media and CUC Broadcasting upon launch. In 1995, Shaw Communications acquired CUC&#x27;s 34% stake and in 1998, it acquired Rogers&#x27; remaining interest of the channel, before Shaw&#x27;s media division was spun off to form Corus Entertainment in 1999.

Since its launch, YTV has aired various programs consisting of both original live-action and animated television series, movies, and third-party shows from various international markets. In addition to its own domestic productions, YTV also airs a number of programming directly from U.S.-based Nickelodeon as well as Disney Channel, and Cartoon Network. Corus used its relationship with Nickelodeon to launch YTV&#x27;s own dedicated channel in 2009.

YTV operates two time shifted feeds, running on both Eastern and Pacific Time Zone schedules, and is available in over 11.0 million households in Canada as of 2013.

== History ==
The channel was licensed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) in 1987 by Rogers Cable and CUC Broadcasting.

The channel launched on September 1, 1988, at 7:00 p.m. with the first program being a special party celebrating the launch of YTV, hosted by John Candy. At launch, Rogers held 75% of the channel while CUC owned 25%.

In 1994, the stakes of YTV&#x27;s ownership was changed, with CUC now owning 34% and Rogers now owning 66%. However, in 1995, Calgary-based Shaw Communications acquired CUC&#x27;s stake of 34% ownership of YTV. By 1998, Shaw had secured full control of YTV. In 1999, the media assets of Shaw were spun off to form Corus Entertainment.

Two Corus specialty channel applications for YTV extensions, YTV POW!, an internationally sourced kids&#x27; action, adventure and superhero genre, and YTV OneWorld, targeting children and teenagers from age 9 to 17 with travel, humour, games, and STEM were approved on September 18, 2008. The YTV Oneworld license was used to launch Nickelodeon Canada.

On January 11, 2011, a high-definition feed was launched.

=== Branding history ===

Initially, YTV utilized computer-generated graphics in their network IDs, which were normally set against different sky backgrounds that changed depending on the time of day. The channel also started using various slogans (&quot;The Spirit of Youth&quot;, &quot;Young as You Are!&quot;, &quot;The Youth Channel&quot; and &quot;Canada&#x27;s Youth Channel&quot;) to promote and reflect their youth demographic at the time.

Over the years, the channel continued to revise their branding and promotional material. In 1993, a number of different on-air logos were taken effect, which features the logo&#x27;s text placed atop of random objects. One logo variant used on production credits (and presumably the &quot;official&quot; logo) features an arrangement of the logo&#x27;s text placed on a red screen of a stylized purple television set. In December 1994, the YTV text was changed, arranged the same way as before, though with an altered design of the TV background and logotype.

In the fall of 1998, YTV started to use a Nickelodeon-style &quot;gross-out&quot; factor in its branding and adopted a new slogan, &quot;Keep It Weird&quot;. The logo was changed again in September 2000 with the TV background dropped and the YTV text modified. The channel continued utilizing various on-air logos featuring the same arrangement of the logo&#x27;s text, this time on various bizarre and imaginative creatures. Many of the channel’s promos from this period often focused on promoting the brand through crude humour, often at the expense of the programs being advertised. As this advertising style permeated the station at all hours of the day, it was heavily criticized, especially by older fans of the station.

As a response, a new post-6:00 p.m. advertising style was developed for older audiences, which used a much simpler logo (similar to the current logo used today) and sleeker packaging with reduced &quot;gross-out&quot; tactics. Introduced on September 5, 2005, the simple logo (designed by Troika Design Group) first appeared on YTV&#x27;s promos and even appeared on credits of newer original programming before being later adopted for the entire channel in 2007, replacing the creatures that had been used in rotation during the channel’s daytime hours.

On August 31, 2009, the logo was changed slightly to have featured new colours, and the background was simplified. The bumpers were reduced and were later replaced by opaque digital on-screen graphics telling viewers which programs are coming next, and promotions of the programs. As part of a slightly updated look in September 2012, the colour variants were dropped, leaving only the blue variation.

On October 6, 2014, the channel underwent a brand refresh, with new graphics and bumps created by the Toronto-based Eloisa Iturbe Studio. In addition, the channel updated its logo by having it face upwards to the left instead of directly to the audience.

=== Program jockeys ===
Beginning in September 1990, YTV called their program jockeys as &quot;PJs&quot; in the same vein as disc jockey (DJ) or video jockey (VJ). Current hosts of these segments have since dropped the moniker as of the mid-1990s. On April 29, 2023, Corus dropped all program jockeys due to cuts from Corus CEO Doug Murphy. However, all final 3 hosts (Spencer, Kelsey, &amp; Melony) still make appearances on social media.

=== Former ===

==== Vortex on Demand ====
In July 2005, Corus Entertainment partnered up with Comcast Corporation to launch a cable video-on-demand service called &quot;Vortex on Demand&quot; in the U.S. The deal consisted of 393 30-minute animated TV series from the Nelvana library; it aired programs such as &quot;Cadillacs &amp; Dinosaurs&quot; and &quot;Medabots&quot;. The service was discontinued in mid-2007.

==== Bionix On Demand ====
In 2008, Corus Entertainment started offering a video-on-demand service called &quot;Bionix On Demand&quot; to Canadian cable providers. Rogers Cable and Shaw Cable were the only providers to offer the service. The service offered older and newer anime programs that did not air on YTV itself. The video-on-demand service was previously titled &quot;YTV Anime On Demand&quot;. Bionix On Demand was discontinued on December 17, 2009, and was replaced by YTV On Demand.

==== YTV GO ====
YTV GO was a TV Everywhere mobile app available on the App Store and Google Play Store. It was available at no extra charge to all subscribed customers of Access Communications, Bell Satellite TV, Cogeco, Shaw Cable, Shaw Direct, Telus, and VMedia. It offered episodes of various programming from YTV. The app operated between September 2015 and May 1, 2019.

==== Vrak.TV ====

Along with YTV, Vrak launched on September 1, 1988 as Le Canal Famillie, which began as a French version of its sister network, Family. In 2001, the channel was renamed to Vrak.TV. On July 5, 2013, due to the acquisition of Astral by Bell Media, Vrak.TV was separated from Family. In 2014, it rebranded as Vrak, while launching a new block called &quot;Vrak2&quot;. In 2016, the channel changed its demographic to the 13-35 age group due to the success of its &quot;Vrak2&quot; block.

On August 16, 2023, Vrak and Z were removed from Vidéotron, the company that created the original channel it was based on 41 years earlier, whilst Bell removed Yoopa from all of their TV services a day later. Yoopa got shut down on January 11, 2024, and was replaced with a TV broadcast version of its parent company&#x27;s Qub Radio channel.

Two days later on August 18, 2023, Bell Media announced that the channel would be closing on October 1, 2023, owing to &quot;challenges&quot; in the broadcasting sector, lack of viewers and regulatory affairs deemed &quot;outdated&quot; by Bell Media. On September 25, the CRTC confirmed it had revoked Vrak&#x27;s licence at the request of Bell Media, with the channel shut down on October 1, 2023.

<doc id="416456" wikidata="Q1851323" url="?curid=416456" title="List of United States senators from Tennessee">
<text>Tennessee was admitted to the Union on June 1, 1796. Its United States Senate seats were declared vacant in March 1862 owing to its secession from the Union. They were again filled from July 1866. Tennessee&#x27;s current senators are Republicans Marsha Blackburn (since 2019) and Bill Hagerty (since 2021). Kenneth McKellar was Tennessee&#x27;s longest-serving senator (1917–1953).

<text>Texas was admitted to the United States on December 29, 1845, and elects its U.S. senators to class 1 and class 2. The state&#x27;s current senators are Republicans John Cornyn (serving since 2002) and Ted Cruz (serving since 2013). A total of 27 Democrats, 7 Republicans, and 1 Liberal Republican have served or are serving as U.S. senators from Texas. Morris Sheppard was Texas&#x27;s longest-serving senator (1913–1941).

<doc id="416458" wikidata="Q498769" url="?curid=416458" title="List of United States senators from Utah">
<text>Utah was admitted to the Union on January 4, 1896, and it popularly elects U.S. senators to class 1 and class 3, despite the Utah State Legislature&#x27;s rejection of the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution when it was passed in 1913. Its current senators are Republicans Mike Lee (since 2011) and John Curtis (since 2025). Orrin Hatch was Utah&#x27;s longest-serving senator (1977–2019). Utah is one of sixteen states alongside California, Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, Pennsylvania, South Dakota and West Virginia to have a younger senior senator and an older junior senator.

<doc id="416469" wikidata="Q1772739" url="?curid=416469" title="List of United States senators from Virginia">
<text>Virginia has sent senators to the U.S. Senate since 1789. Its Senate seats were declared vacant in March 1861, due to its secession from the Union, but senators representing its western counties continued to sit until March 1865. Virginia&#x27;s Senate seats were again filled from January 1870. Virginia&#x27;s current senators are Democrats Mark Warner and Tim Kaine. Harry F. Byrd was Virginia&#x27;s longest-serving senator (1933–1965). Both incumbent senators were previously served as Governor of Virginia from 2002 to 2010.

<doc id="416470" wikidata="Q1851325" url="?curid=416470" title="List of United States senators from Vermont">
<text>Vermont was admitted to the Union on March 4, 1791. From the 1850s until well into the 20th century, Vermont was always represented by members of the Republican Party. Democrat Patrick Leahy (served 1975–2023) was Vermont&#x27;s longest serving US senator. Its current members of the United States Senate are Independent Bernie Sanders (since 2007) and Democrat Peter Welch (since 2023). Both senators served in the United States House of Representatives immediately prior, where they represented Vermont&#x27;s only House district.

Robert Byrd was the state&#x27;s longest serving senator, served from 1959 until his death in 2010. He is also the longest serving Senator in United States history.

<text>The ischiocavernosus muscle (erectores penis &quot;or&quot; erector clitoridis in older texts) is a muscle just below the surface of the perineum, present in both men and women.

==Structure==
It arises by tendinous and fleshy fibers from the inner surface of the tuberosity of the ischium, behind the crus penis; and from the inferior pubic rami and ischium on either side of the crus.

From these points fleshy fibers succeed, and end in an aponeurosis which is inserted into the sides and under surface of the crus penis.

==Function==
In females, the ischiocavernosus muscle assists with clitoral erection. In males, it helps to stabilize the erect penis by compressing the crus penis and retarding the return of blood through the veins.

<text>Washington was admitted to the Union on November 11, 1889, and elects its United States senators to class 1 and class 3. Its current U.S. senators are Democrats Patty Murray (since 1993) and Maria Cantwell (since 2001) making it one of only four states alongside Minnesota, Nevada and New Hampshire to have two female U.S. senators.

<text>Wyoming was admitted to the Union on July 10, 1890, and elects United States senators to class 1 and class 2. Its current U.S. senators are Republicans John Barrasso (serving since 2007) and Cynthia Lummis (serving since 2021). 21 people have served as a United States senator from Wyoming. Francis E. Warren was Wyoming&#x27;s longest serving senator (served 1890–1893; 1895–1929).

<text>Granville Island is a peninsula and shopping district in the Fairview neighbourhood of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, across False Creek from Downtown Vancouver, under the south end of the Granville Street Bridge. Formerly an industrial manufacturing area, it was named after Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville.

It includes a public market, restaurants, a marina, a hotel, the False Creek Community Centre, numerous artists&#x27; studios and workshops, and various performing arts theatres, including the Arts Club Theatre Company and Carousel Theatre.


It was the location for the finale of the film &quot;&quot; (2011). The Great Canadian Pottery Throw Down, first broadcast in 2024, was filmed in the area.

The Vancouver International Children&#x27;s Festival, the Vancouver Fringe Festival, and the Vancouver Writers Fest are held there.

== Transportation ==
False Creek Ferries and Aquabus provide ferry service from Granville Island to Downtown Vancouver, Yaletown, False Creek, the West End, and Vanier Park. Other water transportation options include a water taxi service to Bowen Island provided by English Bay Launch.

WESTCOAST Sightseeing and Vancouver Trolley Hop-On, Hop-Off services have stops there.

Between 1998 and 2011, the Vancouver Downtown Historic Railway operated between Granville Island and Science World. The streetcar is now permanently shut down.

==History==
The peninsula was originally used by the Musqueam and Squamish peoples as a fishing area. A village was established in the area named in the Hunquminum language and in the Squamish language.

The city of Vancouver was called Granville until it was renamed in 1886, but the former name was kept and given to Granville Street, which spanned the small inlet known as False Creek. False Creek in the late 19th century was more than twice today&#x27;s size, and its tidal flats included a large permanent sandbar over which spanned the original, rickety, wooden Granville Street bridge. This sandbar, which would eventually become Granville Island, was first mapped by Captain George Henry Richards in the British Boundary Commission&#x27;s naval expedition in 1858–59, and the island today conforms roughly to the size and shape documented at that time. A British Admiralty Chart of 1893 shows the island in greater detail and conforming even more accurately to today&#x27;s Granville Island.

Shortly after the creation of the original Granville Street bridge in 1889, the first, unofficial, attempt was made to stabilize the sandbar by driving piles around the perimeter in order to create some free real estate. The Federal government put a stop to the work as a menace to navigation, but the piles remain visible in a photo taken in 1891.

In 1915, with the port of Vancouver growing, the newly formed Vancouver Harbour Commission approved a reclamation project in False Creek for an industrial area. A island, connected to the mainland by a combined road and rail bridge at its south end, was to be built. Almost of fill was dredged largely by a man named Alvin Kingston, from the surrounding waters of False Creek to create the island under the Granville Street Bridge. The total cost for the reclamation was $342,000. It was originally called Industrial Island, but Granville Island, named after the bridge, that ran directly overhead, was the name that stuck.

The first tenant, B.C. Equipment Ltd., set the standard by building a wood-framed machine shop, clad on all sides in corrugated tin, at the Island&#x27;s western end. (Today the same structure houses part of the Granville Island Public Market.) The company repaired and assembled heavy equipment for mining and forestry industries and used barges for shipping.

By 1923, virtually every lot on the Island was occupied, mostly by similar corrugated-tin factories.

During the Great Depression, one of Vancouver&#x27;s several hobo jungles sprang up on the False Creek flats opposite Granville Island&#x27;s north shore. &quot;Shackers&quot; lived on the island, in town, or in floathouses, and survived by fishing and beachcombing and sold salmon, smelt, and wood door to door or at the public market on Main Street. They were basically self-sufficient and were left alone.

During the Second World War, Wright&#x27;s Canadian Ropes on the island was Canada&#x27;s biggest manufacturer of heavy-duty wire rope. Their Green Heart product was supplied to forestry and mining industries. A fire in 1953 gutted their Granville Island factory so they moved to south Vancouver in 1956.
In 1972, a federal order-in-council assigned management of the 14-hectare site to Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC). The federal government invested $24.7 million there between 1973 and 1982. In 1979, the federal and provincial governments converted a 50,000 square foot building to the Public Market. In 1980, the Emily Carr University of Art &amp; Design was added to the island.

Ron Basford, the Minister responsible for CMHC, was referred to as Mr. Granville and was later recognized with the naming of Ron Basford Park on Granville Island.

In 2016, the federal government announced a commitment to develop a 2040 plan to redevelop the island, in part because the Emily Carr University was going to move off the island.

==Granville Island Public Market==
The Granville Island Public Market was established in 1979 as a place where farmers and other food vendors could sell to consumers. It operates year-round in an enclosed facility where visitors can purchase fresh produce, meat, fish and seafood, cheeses and other products, many locally sourced. There are generally 50 vendors selling a wide range of items, from Mexican, Asian, Greek and deli food to candy and snacks. A large scenic outdoor eating area adjacent to it overlooks downtown Vancouver. The Market attracts both local residents and tourists, and includes a &quot;kids&#x27; market&quot; for children.

==Other businesses==
Granville Island Brewing Co. is a beer company founded on Granville Island in 1984, but whose main base of operations was moved to Kelowna, British Columbia sometime later. In 2009 it was purchased by Molson&#x27;s Brewery and continues to brew small batches of its varieties at the original Granville Island brewing site. It offers beer tasting and brewery tours.

Ocean Concrete is the island&#x27;s longest-established tenant, since 1917. In 2014, OSGEMEOS (Portuguese for THE TWINS), consisting of brother duo Gustavo and Otavio Pandolfo, made the concrete silos the site of their ongoing mural project, &#x27;Giants&#x27;.

Granville Island is home to several theatre companies, including as the Arts Club Theatre Company, Arts Umbrella, Axis Theatre Company, Boca Del Lupo, Carousel Theatre for Young People, Ruby Slippers Production Company, and the Vancouver Theatre Sports League improv troupe.

Canada&#x27;s oldest physical hammock shop, the Hamuhk Hangout Place, has operated on Granville Island since 1995.

<text>A business magnate, also known as an industrialist or tycoon, is a person who has achieved immense wealth through the creation or ownership of multiple lines of enterprise. The term characteristically refers to a powerful entrepreneur and investor who controls, through personal enterprise ownership or a dominant shareholding position, a firm or industry whose goods or services are widely consumed. Such individuals have been known by different terms throughout history, such as robber barons, captains of industry, moguls, oligarchs, plutocrats, or tai-pans.

==Etymology and history==
The term &quot;magnate&quot; derives from the Latin word (plural of &quot;&quot;), meaning &quot;great man&quot; or &quot;great nobleman&quot;.

The term &quot;mogul&quot; is an English corruption of &quot;mughal&quot;, Persian or Arabic for &quot;Mongol&quot;. It alludes to emperors of the Mughal Empire in Early Modern India, who possessed great power and storied riches capable of producing wonders of opulence, such as the Taj Mahal.

The term &quot;tycoon&quot; derives from the Japanese word , which means &quot;great lord&quot;, used as a title for the &quot;shōgun&quot;. The word entered the English language in 1857 with the return of Commodore Perry to the United States. US President Abraham Lincoln was humorously referred to as &quot;the Tycoon&quot; by his aides John Nicolay and John Hay. The term spread to the business community, where it has been used ever since.

==Usage==

Modern business magnates are entrepreneurs that amass on their own or wield substantial family fortunes in the process of building or running their own businesses. Some are widely known in connection with these entrepreneurial activities, others through highly-visible secondary pursuits such as philanthropy, political fundraising and campaign financing, and sports team ownership or sponsorship.

The terms &quot;mogul&quot;, &quot;tycoon&quot;, and &quot;baron&quot; were often applied to late-19th- and early-20th-century North American business magnates in extractive industries such as mining, logging and petroleum, transportation fields such as shipping and railroads, manufacturing such as automaking and steelmaking, in banking, as well as newspaper publishing. Their dominance was known as the Second Industrial Revolution, the Gilded Age, or the Robber Baron Era.
Examples of business magnates in the western world include historical figures such as pottery entrepreneur Josiah Wedgwood, oilmen John D. Rockefeller and Fred C. Koch, automobile pioneer Henry Ford, aviation pioneer Howard Hughes, shipping and railroad veterans Aristotle Onassis, Cornelius Vanderbilt, Leland Stanford, Jay Gould and James J. Hill, steel innovator Andrew Carnegie, newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst, poultry entrepreneur Arthur Perdue, retail merchant Sam Walton, and bankers J. P. Morgan and Mayer Amschel Rothschild. Contemporary industrial tycoons include e-commerce entrepreneur Jeff Bezos, investor Warren Buffett, computer programmers Bill Gates and Paul Allen, technology innovator Steve Jobs, vacuum cleaner retailer Sir James Dyson, media proprietors Sumner Redstone, Ted Turner and Rupert Murdoch, industrial entrepreneur Elon Musk, steel investor Lakshmi Mittal, telecommunications investor Carlos Slim, Virgin Group founder Sir Richard Branson, Formula 1 executive Bernie Ecclestone, and internet entrepreneurs Larry Page and Sergey Brin.

<text>Anasyrma () composed of ἀνά &quot;ana&quot; &quot;up, against, back&quot;, and σύρμα &quot;syrma&quot; &quot;a dragging motion&quot;; plural: anasyrmata (), also called anasyrmos (), is the gesture of lifting the skirt or kilt. It is used in connection with certain religious rituals, eroticism, and lewd jokes (see, for example, Baubo). The term is used in describing corresponding works of art.

Anasyrma may be a deliberately provocative self-exposing of one&#x27;s naked genitals or buttocks. The famous example of the latter case is Aphrodite Kallipygos (&quot;Aphrodite of the beautiful buttocks&quot;). In other contexts, this gesture has an apotropaic character, that is, a means to ward off a supernatural enemy, or it may be a sign of mockery, analogous to mooning.

==Greek antiquity==

Ritual jesting and intimate exposure were common in the cults of Demeter and Dionysus, and figure in the celebration of the Eleusinian mysteries associated with these divinities. The mythographer Apollodorus says that Iambe&#x27;s jesting was the reason for the practice of ritual jesting at the Thesmophoria, a festival celebrated in honor of Demeter and Persephone. In other versions of the myth of Demeter, the goddess is received by a woman named Baubo, a crone who makes her laugh by exposing herself, in a ritual gesture called anasyrma (&quot;lifting [of skirts]&quot;). A set of statuettes from Priene, a Greek city on the west coast of Asia Minor, are usually identified as &quot;Baubo&quot; figurines, representing the female body as the face conflated with the lower part of the abdomen. These appeared as counterparts to the phalluses decorated with eyes, mouth, and sometimes legs, that appeared on vase paintings and were made as statuettes.

Terracotta hermaphrodite figurines in the so-called &quot;anasyromenos&quot; pose, with breasts and a long garment lifted to reveal a phallus, have been found from Sicily to Lesbos, dating back to the late Classical and early Hellenistic period. The &quot;anasyromenos&quot; pose, however, was not invented in the 4th century BCE; figures of this type drew on a much earlier eastern iconographic tradition employed for female divinities. Ancient literature suggests that the figures represent the androgynous Cypriot deity Aphroditus (possibly a form of Astarte), whose cult was introduced into mainland Greece between the 5th–4th century BCE. The revealed phallus was believed to have apotropaic magical powers, averting the evil eye or &quot;invidia&quot; and bestowing good luck.

==Apotropaic effect of nakedness==
Many historical references suggest that anasyrma had dramatic or supernatural effect—positive or negative. Pliny the Elder wrote that a menstruating woman who uncovers her body can scare away hailstorms, whirlwinds and lightning. If she strips naked and walks around a field of wheat, caterpillars, worms and beetles fall off the heads. Even when not menstruating, she can lull a storm out at sea by stripping.
According to folklore, women lifted their skirts to chase off enemies in Ireland and China. A story from &quot;The Irish Times&quot; (September 23, 1977) reported a potentially violent incident involving several men, which was averted by a woman exposing her genitals to the attackers. According to Balkan folklore, when it rained too much, women would run into the fields and lift their skirts to scare the gods and end the rain. Maimonides also mentions this ritual to ward off the rain while expressing his disapproval. Stripping away clothing was perceived as creating a &quot;raw&quot; state closer to nature than society, facilitating interaction with supernatural entities. In Jean de La Fontaine&#x27;s &quot;Nouveaux Contes&quot; (1674), a demon is repulsed by the sight of a woman lifting her skirt. Associated carvings, called sheela na gigs, were common on medieval churches in northern Europe and the British Isles.

In some nations of Africa, a woman stripping naked and displaying herself is still considered a curse and a means to ward off evil.

In Nigeria, during mass protests against the petroleum industry, women threatened to disrobe, leading ChevronTexaco, wishing to avoid the shame this gesture would bring on the company in the eyes of local residents, to strike a deal with the community to provide needed services. Leymah Gbowee threatened to strip naked to prevent being arrested as she and other women surrounded the courtroom where peace negotiations were taking place during the Second Liberian Civil War. The warlords and generals at the negotiating table, fearing the curse that would befall them should they witness her nakedness, retreated back to the conference room. The women maintained their protest for two more weeks, until the negotiations finally reached a peace settlement, an episode depicted in the 2008 documentary film &quot;Pray the Devil Back to Hell&quot; .

<text>William Hal Ashby (September 2, 1929 – December 27, 1988) was an American film director and editor. His work exemplified the countercultural attitude of the era. He directed wide-ranging films featuring iconic performances. He is associated with the New Hollywood wave of filmmaking with filmmakers such as Martin Scorsese, Woody Allen, Mike Nichols, and Sidney Lumet.

Before his career as a director Ashby edited films for Norman Jewison, notably &quot;The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming&quot; (1966), which earned Ashby an Oscar nomination for Best Editing, and &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; (1967), which earned him his only Oscar for the same category. Ashby received a third Oscar nomination, this time for Best Director for &quot;Coming Home&quot; (1978). Other films directed by Ashby include &quot;The Landlord&quot; (1970), &quot;Harold and Maude&quot; (1971), &quot;The Last Detail&quot; (1973), &quot;Shampoo&quot; (1975), &quot;Bound for Glory&quot; (1976), and &quot;Being There&quot; (1979).

==Early life and education==
Ashby was born September 2, 1929, in Ogden, Utah, the youngest of four siblings born to Mormon parents Eileen Ireta (née Hetzler) and James Thomas Ashby, a dairy farm owner. Ashby&#x27;s parents divorced in 1936, after which his father remarried.

Following the divorce, Ashby and his siblings lived with their mother, briefly in Logan, Utah, before relocating to Portland, Oregon, where his elder brother took a job in the timber industry. His mother, a cooking enthusiast, opened a restaurant in Portland. After several years in Portland, the family returned to Ogden, where Ashby primarily lived with his father. When Ashby was 12 years old, his father committed suicide.

Ashby subsequently dropped out of high school. Ashby-approved studio biographies concealed this, falsely stating that he graduated from Utah State University (situated in nearby Logan, Utah) to ensure he fit into the social milieu of college-educated peers like Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese. Ashby was married and divorced by the time he was 19.

==Career==
===1967–1978: Breakthrough and stardom===
As Ashby was entering adult life, he moved from Utah to Los Angeles, California, where he pursued a bohemian lifestyle and ultimately became an assistant film editor through a long apprenticeship. His career gained momentum when he served as the editor of &quot;The Loved One&quot; (1965), an adaptation of the Evelyn Waugh novel that involved such New Hollywood contemporaries as screenwriter Terry Southern and cinematographer Haskell Wexler. After being nominated for the Academy Award for Film Editing in 1967 for &quot;The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming&quot;, His big break occurred one year later when he won the award for &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;. Ashby often stated that the practice of editing provided him with the best filmmaking background outside of traditional university study and carried the techniques learned as an editor with him when he began directing.

At the urging of mentor Norman Jewison, Ashby directed his first film, &quot;The Landlord&quot;—an early rumination on the social dynamics of gentrification in Park Slope, Brooklyn—in 1970. While his birth date placed him within the Silent Generation, the filmmaker (who had been a habitual marijuana smoker since 1950), eagerly embraced the hippie lifestyle, adopting vegetarianism and growing his hair long before it became &quot;de rigueur&quot;.

Over the next ten years, Ashby directed several acclaimed and popular films. Many were about outsiders and adventurers traversing the pathways of life. They included the off-beat romance &quot;Harold and Maude&quot; (1971), &quot;The Last Detail&quot; (1973), and the social satire &quot;Being There&quot; (1979), with Peter Sellers, giving the star a well-received role after many felt he had lapsed into self-parody. His most significant commercial success was &quot;Shampoo&quot; (1975), a collaboration with Warren Beatty and Robert Towne that satirized late-1960s sexual and social mores through the life of a hairdresser modeled after such contemporaneous figures as Jay Sebring and Jon Peters. &quot;Bound for Glory&quot; (1976), a muted biography of Woody Guthrie starring David Carradine, was the first film to use a Steadicam.

In June 1973, Michael Douglas and Saul Zaentz hired Ashby to direct &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;, after the original director Miloš Forman became unavailable due to the reimposition of censorship in his native Czechoslovakia after the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia and after Forman&#x27;s initial replacement Richard Rush was unable to secure studio funding. Ashby was responsible for casting Jack Nicholson as R.P. McMurphy, but this resulted in a nine-month delay during which Forman fled to the United States and was rehired as director.

Aside from &quot;Shampoo&quot;, Ashby&#x27;s most commercially successful film was the Vietnam War drama &quot;Coming Home&quot; (1978). Starring Jane Fonda and Jon Voight, both in Academy Award-winning performances, it was for this film that Ashby earned his only Best Director Oscar nomination. Arriving in the post-&quot;Jaws&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot; era, &quot;Coming Home&quot; was one of the last films to encapsulate the modestly budgeted, socially realistic ethos of the New Hollywood era, earning nearly $15 million in returns and rentals on a $3 million budget.

===1979–1988: Later films===
Because of his critical success and dependable profitability, shortly after the success of &quot;Coming Home&quot;, Ashby was able to form a production company, Northstar, under the auspices of Lorimar. After &quot;Being There&quot;, Ashby became more reclusive, often retreating to his home in Malibu Colony, a gated enclave in the city. Later, it was widely rumored in a likely whisper campaign from Lorimar (whose executives clashed with the director) that Ashby had become dependent upon cocaine, a drug that he only used intermittently after the production of &quot;Bound for Glory&quot;. As a consequence of these rumors, he slowly became unemployable. Eva Gardos, an editor who worked with Ashby during the period, has asserted that his drug intake remained largely confined to marijuana and psilocybin.

Following &quot;Being There&quot;, Ashby was provisionally set to reunite with Sellers and Terry Southern on &quot;Grossing Out&quot;, a black comedy inspired by the actor&#x27;s chance meeting with an international arms dealer on an airplane. Although Southern (who had not had a screenplay go to production in a decade) was rejuvenated by the prospect of working with the duo and produced a script that was said to be on par with his 1960s oeuvre, the project went into development hell after Sellers sudden death from a heart attack in July 1980. During this period, the productions of &quot;Second-Hand Hearts&quot; and &quot;Lookin&#x27; to Get Out&quot; The latter a Las Vegas caper that reunited him with Voight and featured Voight&#x27;s young daughter, Angelina Jolie was plagued by the increasingly strained relationship between Ashby and Lorimar. Filmed in 1979, &quot;Second-Hand Hearts&quot; only received a poorly reviewed limited release in 1981 before being pulled from circulation for nearly thirty years. Belatedly released in October 1982, &quot;Lookin&#x27; to Get Out&quot; earned a little under $1 million in returns and rentals on an estimated $17 million budget. During this period, Lorimar executives grew less tolerant of his increasingly perfectionist production (811,000 feet of film were used shooting &quot;Lookin&#x27; to Get Out&quot;) and editing techniques, a montage in the latter film set to The Police&#x27;s &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot; took six months to perfect but proved to be logistically unusable due to a Lorimar agreement with the American Federation of Musicians.

Initially set to helm &quot;Tootsie&quot; after two years of negotiations and Ashby-directed wig and makeup tests, Lorimar executives blocked him from working on the film because part of the pre-production period overlapped with final work on the long-gestating &quot;Lookin&#x27; to Get Out&quot;, which was eventually recut by the studio when Ashby&#x27;s work was deemed to be unsatisfactory. (Decades later, Ashby&#x27;s cut was rediscovered and released on DVD in 2009.) As Dustin Hoffman had not offered a &quot;formal commitment&quot; to the production at the time of Ashby&#x27;s dismissal, the director forfeited his $1.5 million fee. While post-production of &quot;Lookin&#x27; to Get Out&quot; continued, Lorimar permitted Ashby to film The Rolling Stones&#x27; 1981 American tour documentary, &quot;Let&#x27;s Spend the Night Together&quot;, the director was a longtime fan of the group. He collapsed before the final filmed concert at Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Arizona, on December 13, 1981. Although Jeff Wexler said Ashby was &quot;partying way beyond his capabilities with the Stones,&quot; Caleb Deschanel has said that Ashby (who directed the concert shoot on a gurney) simply had the flu. The film was well-received but gained little traction during a limited theatrical release. In September 1983, Ashby directed &quot;Solo Trans&quot;, a Neil Young concert video that was released the following year.

&quot;The Slugger&#x27;s Wife&quot;, with a screenplay written by Neil Simon, was a critical and commercial failure. Ashby (whose cocaine use had accelerated throughout the shoot) was fired after delivering a 20-minute rough cut of the beginning of the film that included almost no dialogue. When the Oliver Stone-written &quot;8 Million Ways to Die&quot; fared similarly at the box office, Ashby&#x27;s post-production process was considered to be such a liability that he was fired by the production company on the final day of principal photography.

Attempting to turn a corner in his declining career, Ashby stopped using drugs, trimmed his hair and beard, and began to frequently attend Hollywood parties wearing a navy-blue blazer so as to suggest that he was once again employable. Despite these efforts, he could only find work as a television director, helming one of three pilots for &quot;Beverly Hills Buntz&quot;, an unsuccessful &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; spinoff starring Dennis Franz. He also directed &quot;Jake&#x27;s Journey&quot;, a sword and sorcery fantasy conceived by Graham Chapman.

===Unrealized projects===
==Personal life and death==
Longtime friend Warren Beatty advised Ashby to seek medical care after he complained of various ailments, including undiagnosed phlebitis. He was soon diagnosed with pancreatic cancer that rapidly spread to his lungs, colon, and liver. Ashby died on December 27, 1988, at his home in Malibu, California.

==Influence and legacy==
&quot;The Last Detail&quot;, &quot;Bound for Glory&quot;, &quot;Coming Home&quot;, and &quot;Being There&quot; were all nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or.

American songwriter and guitarist Guthrie Thomas, who coordinated the music in &quot;Bound for Glory&quot; and acted in the film, called Ashby &quot;one of the finest motion picture directors of the 20th century.&quot;

Michael Cimino&#x27;s 1996 film &quot;The Sunchaser&quot;, about a teenager with pancreatic cancer who refuses medical treatment, was dedicated to Ashby.

For the 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; Directors Top Ten poll Niki Caro, Cyrus Frisch, and Wanuri Kahiu voted for &quot;Harold and Maude&quot;, with Frisch describing the film as &quot;an encouragement to think beyond the obvious!&quot;

A 2018 documentary about the director was screened at the Sundance Film Festival. The moving image collection of Hal Ashby is held at the Academy Film Archive. The material at the Academy Film Archive is also complemented by material in the Hal Ashby papers at the academy&#x27;s Margaret Herrick Library.

Hal Ashby has been an influence to the melodic post-hardcore band Touche Amore. He is referenced in the 3rd song &quot;Hal Ashby&quot;, of their album &quot;Spiral in a Straight Line&quot; in the lyrics (“a misguided Hal Ashby catastrophe”).

<text>Food libel laws, also known as food disparagement laws and informally as veggie libel laws, are laws passed in thirteen U.S. states that make it easier for food producers to sue their critics for libel. These thirteen states are the following: Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Texas. Many of the food-disparagement laws establish a lower standard for civil liability and allow for punitive damages and attorney&#x27;s fees for plaintiffs alone, regardless of the case&#x27;s outcome.

These laws vary significantly from state to state, but food libel laws typically allow a food manufacturer or processor to sue a person or group who makes disparaging comments about their food products. In some states these laws also establish different standards of proof than are used in traditional American libel lawsuits, including the practice of placing the burden of proof on the party being sued.

An example of the situation is the &quot;New York Times&quot; reporting about &quot;facts from a study showing the amounts of lead found in over-the-counter calcium supplements&quot; being censored.

== Origins ==
On February 26, 1989, CBS News&#x27; &quot;60 Minutes&quot; aired a segment entitled A&#x27; is for Apple&quot;, in which &quot;60 Minutes&quot; anchors investigated a report published by the Natural Resources Defense Council on the safety of daminozide, a growth regulator used on apples to preserve their freshness. The NRDC, and &quot;60 Minutes&quot; along with them, claimed that daminozide, sold under the brand name Alar, was carcinogenic, especially when consumed by children. According to the report, Alar remained in apple skin even after processing, meaning that not only raw apples, but also apple products, like apple juice and apple sauce, could pose health risks.

Immediately after the segment aired, consumers panicked and apple sales declined by nearly 60% nationwide. Growers reported revenue losses of $100M as a result. Seeking recompense, eleven Washington State apple growers banded together to sue CBS for trade libel: the intentional publication of false information about a product. Trade libel laws stipulate that the burden of proof falls on the plaintiff, meaning that the growers needed to prove in court by &quot;the preponderance of the evidence&quot; that &quot;60 Minutes″&quot; claims about daminozide&#x27;s carcinogenicity were dubious in order for the jury to decide in their favor. The growers failed to do so, and their case was dismissed as a result. In response, lobbyists affiliated with the agricultural industry began to campaign for stricter trade libel laws &quot;specific&quot; to agricultural products. They argued that agricultural products deserved special protections because of their perishability: they might spoil before the truth of claims regarding their safety had been verified. As a result, thirteen states adopted food libel laws, which offer larger settlement sums than regular trade libel laws and, unlike trade libel laws, often place the burden of proof on a case&#x27;s defendant, rather than its plaintiff.

&quot;The Economist&quot; reported that &quot;The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) eventually decided that Alar was indeed a carcinogen.&quot;

==Notable cases==

=== &quot;Texas Beef Group v. Winfrey&quot; ===
In 1998, television talk-show host Oprah Winfrey and one of her guests, Howard Lyman, were involved in a lawsuit, commonly referred to as the Amarillo, Texas beef trial, surrounding the Texas version of a food libel law known as the &quot;False Disparagement of Perishable Food Products Act of 1995&quot;. The words &quot;Cows are herbivores. They shouldn&#x27;t be eating other cows ... It has just stopped me cold from eating another burger.&quot; were attributed to Winfrey as part of a 1996 episode of her show. It was accused that the two made disparaging comments about beef in relation to mad cow disease. Although they were not the first people to be sued using this type of legal action, this case created a media sensation.

In a normal U.S. libel suit, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant is deliberately and knowingly spreading false information. Under the Texas food disparagement law under which Winfrey and Lyman were sued, the plaintiffs—in this case, beef feedlot operator Paul Engler and the company Cactus Feeders—had to convince the jury that Lyman&#x27;s statements on Winfrey&#x27;s show were not &quot;based on reasonable and reliable scientific inquiry, facts, or data.&quot; As a basis for the damages sought in the lawsuit, the plaintiffs noted that cattle futures dropped 10 percent the day after the episode, and that beef prices fell from 62 cents to 55 cents per pound. Engler&#x27;s attorneys argued that the rancher lost $6.7 million, and the plaintiffs sought to recoup total losses of more than $12 million.

The jury in the case found that the statements by Winfrey and Lyman did not constitute libel against the cattlemen. However, Winfrey no longer speaks publicly on the issue, and declines to make videotapes of the original interview available to inquiring journalists.

=== &quot;Beef Products, Inc. v. ABC News&quot; (Pink Slime case) ===
On March 7, 2012, ABC News aired a segment dedicated to investigating a beef product called lean finely textured beef (LFTB) sold by the South Dakota beef company Beef Products, Inc (BPI). ABC News correspondents, including Diane Sawyer, reported on a whistleblower&#x27;s claim that BPI&#x27;s LFTB was used as a filler in the ground beef sold by many American beef companies, as a way of cutting costs. According to the unknown whistleblower and ABC News, BPI&#x27;s LFTB was derived from beef trimmings sprayed with ammonia, and resembled &quot;pink slime&quot;. Throughout March and April, ABC News continued to run segments and publish articles about BPI&#x27;s LFTB, including publishing updates on the company&#x27;s financial losses after the original segment&#x27;s airing.

On September 12, 2012, BPI sued ABC News for food disparagement under South Dakota&#x27;s food libel legislation. They claimed that ABC News falsely portrayed their product, lean finely textured beef, as unfit for human consumption. BPI also claimed that ABC News&#x27; disparaging content led to serious financial damages for BPI. By their report, sales of BPI&#x27;s LFTB dropped from five million to two million pounds per week, prompting the closure of three out of four production facilities and the lay-off of 700 employees. ABC News responded by calling for the case to be dismissed, arguing that it was within ABC News&#x27; First Amendment rights to investigate matters of possible concern to their viewers.

The case went to trial in June, 2017. Under South Dakota&#x27;s Agricultural Food Products Disparagement Act, BPI could have received as much as $5.7 billion in statutory trebled damages were ABC News found liable. After the case had been tried for only three out of the expected eight weeks, ABC News and BPI reached a settlement of $177 million. At the time, this was the largest settlement recorded for a media defamation case. The terms of the settlement were not released.

== Criticism ==
Food libel laws have faced opposition from free speech defenders, who argue that they restrict speech about agricultural products to a degree which is unconstitutional. Of particular concern is that some states&#x27; food libel laws seem to violate the &quot;of or concerning&quot; precedent which was established in the Supreme Court&#x27;s 1964 decision on &quot;New York Times Co. v. Sullivan&quot;. Sullivan, the commissioner of the Montgomery, Alabama, police department, filed suit against the &quot;New York Times&quot; after the paper ran an advertisement paid for by a civil rights group which criticized the Montgomery police department&#x27;s treatment of civil rights protestors. The Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling in favor of the &quot;New York Times&quot; was supported in part by their argument that the advertisement was not explicitly &quot;of or concerning&quot; Sullivan, and so did not constitute libelous speech. Food libel legislation which defines disparagement of perishable agricultural products as any false statement that &quot;implies&quot; a product is unsafe, like the legislation present in Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, and South Dakota, has been thought by some commentators to contradict this &quot;of or concerning&quot; element. Such legislation might allow speech involved in marketing campaigns, like those that tout organic products as superior to their non-organic competitors, to be construed as &quot;implying&quot; the impurity or poor quality of certain products, and thereby potentially illegal. States which broadly define the parties who are eligible to sue under food libel laws have also come under criticism for disregarding the &quot;of or concerning&quot; element. Critics&#x27; argument is that defaming speech about an agricultural product is not explicitly &quot;of or concerning&quot; parties only tangentially related to that product, like its transporters or marketers, meaning that those parties should not be able to file suit if the product is disparaged.

Food libel laws have also been criticized for their non-traditional placement of the burden of proof on the defendant rather than the plaintiff. In both defamation and trade disparagement legislation, &quot;plaintiffs&quot; are tasked with proving to the court that the speech in question is &quot;false&quot;. In food libel legislation present in all but two of the states which have food libel laws on their books, &quot;defendants&quot; are tasked with proving to the courts that their statements about the agricultural product in question are &quot;true&quot;. This is done by presenting scientific evidence to support the claims made about product safety and enlisting expert witnesses to substantiate those claims. Because these steps are so costly, there is concern that only very wealthy defendants would be able to muster a defense against a food disparagement claim.

For reasons such as those described above, food libel laws and cases filed under them have been accused by online commentators and civil liberties activism groups, such as the Civil Liberties Defense Center, for propagating a chilling effect. In a legal context, the &quot;chilling effect&quot; describes the phenomenon by which speech on a certain subject is indirectly curtailed by the passage of laws. Journalists have reported that simply the risk of legal retaliation for writing about food safety issues has stopped them from doing so. Smaller publishers, without the financial means to mount a defense should the producer of a food product oppose an author&#x27;s commentary on it, have significantly revised or even canceled potentially liable books. Robert Hatherill&#x27;s &quot;Eat to Beat Cancer&quot; and Britt Bailey&#x27;s &quot;Against the Grain: Biotechnology and the Corporate Takeover of Your Food&quot; are notable examples of this practice. The former was subject to extensive editing by its publisher—whole sections related to links between meat and cancer were deleted—and the latter was canceled entirely after its publisher received a letter from Monsanto warning of a possible suit. Ozzie Zehner self-censored his &quot;Green Illusions&quot;, an analysis of the detrimental effects of certain environmental protection initiatives, because it included criticism of agribusiness. In the introduction to the book&#x27;s chapter on consumption, Zehner wrote, &quot;So-called food disparagement laws (also known as &#x27;veggie libel laws&#x27;) enable the food industry to sue journalists, writers, and other people who criticize their products, often placing the burden of proof on the defendant ... Unlike Winfrey, I do not have the financial resources to defend myself in such a suit, and as a result you and other readers will be cheated out of the whole story&quot;, referencing the &quot;Texas Beef Group v. Oprah Winfrey&quot; case.

Correspondingly, food libel cases have been alleged to be strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPPs). In general, a SLAPP is a defamation or libel suit whose primary purpose is to silence the speaker and intimidate others from engaging in similar speech. In the specific context of food libel, the implication of the term is that agricultural companies sue under food libel laws in hopes of disincentivizing other potential critics lest they too be subjugated to a costly and inconvenient legal battle, rather than to necessarily win the case and recoup the costs of a damaged reputation. Complicating matters, twenty-nine states currently have statutes intended to prevent against the filing of SLAPP suits, including nine of the thirteen states with food libel laws.

== In media ==
Public awareness of food libel laws and their impacts rose after the airing of Robert Kenner&#x27;s 2008 documentary &quot;Food Inc&quot;., which attempted to investigate the commercial production of food. The documentary featured a scene in which Robert Kenner interviewed Barbara Kowalcyk, a scientist and food-safety activist whose son had died after eating a hamburger contaminated with &quot;E. coli&quot;. When Kenner asks Kowalcyk how her eating habits have changed after her son&#x27;s death, she replies that she is unable to discuss the subject because doing so might open her up to a lawsuit under food libel legislation.

The laws are parodied in the &quot;King of the Hill&quot; episode &quot;Love Hurts and So Does Art&quot; (1999) in which a modern art exhibit, juxtaposing a starving child with an X-ray of an American&#x27;s colon blocked with beef, is shut down, because &quot;in the state of Texas, there&#x27;s a law against defaming beef.&quot;

<text>The Mass Rapid Transit system, locally known by the initialism MRT, is a rapid transit system in Singapore and the island country&#x27;s principal mode of railway transportation. After two decades of planning the system commenced operations in November 1987 with an initial stretch consisting of five stations. The network has since grown to span the length and breadth of the country&#x27;s main island – with the exception of the forested core and the rural northwestern region – in accordance with Singapore&#x27;s aim of developing a comprehensive rail network as the backbone of the country&#x27;s public transportation system, averaging a daily ridership of 3.41 million in 2024.

The MRT network encompasses approximately of grade-separated route on standard gauge. As of 2024, there are currently 143 operational stations dispersed across six operational lines arrayed in a circle-radial topology. Two more lines and 44 stations are currently under construction, in addition to ongoing extension works on existing lines. In total, this will schedule the network to double in length to about by 2040. Further studies are ongoing on potential new alignments and lines, as well as infill stations in the Land Transport Authority&#x27;s (LTA) Land Transport Masterplan 2040. The island-wide heavy rail network interchanges with a series of automated guideway transit networks localised to select suburban towns — collectively known as the Light Rail Transit (LRT) system — which, along with public buses, complement the mainline by providing a last mile link between MRT stations and HDB public housing estates.

The MRT is the oldest, busiest, and most comprehensive metro system in Southeast Asia. Capital expenditure on its rail infrastructure reached a cumulative S$150 billion in 2021, making the network one of the world&#x27;s costliest on both a per-kilometre and absolute basis. The system is managed in conformity with a semi-nationalised hybrid regulatory framework; construction and procurement fall under the purview of the Land Transport Authority (LTA), a statutory board of the government that allocates operating concessions to the for-profit private corporations SMRT and SBS Transit. These operators are responsible for asset maintenance on their respective lines, and also run bus services, facilitating operational synchronicity and the horizontal integration of the broader public transportation network.

The MRT is fully automated and has an extensive driverless rapid transit system. Asset renewal works are periodically carried out to modernise the network and ensure its continued reliability; all stations feature platform screen doors, Wi-Fi connectivity, lifts, climate control, and accessibility provisions, among others. Much of the early network is elevated above ground on concrete viaducts, with a small portion running at-grade; newer lines are largely subterranean, incorporating several of the lengthiest continuous subway tunnel sections in the world. A number of underground stations double as purpose-built air raid shelters under the operational authority of the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF); these stations incorporate deep-level station boxes cast with hardened concrete and blast doors fashioned out of reinforced steel to withstand conventional aerial and chemical ordnance.

==History==
===Planning and inception===
The origins of the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) were derived from a forecast by the country&#x27;s planners back in 1967 which stated the need for a rail-based urban transport system by 1992.

In 1972, a study was conducted by the American firms Wilbur Smith and Associates, Parsons Brinckerhoff (now WSP USA), Tudor, and Bechtel, which was accounted for by the World Bank on behalf of the United Nations Development Programme. The study was undertaken for eight years, including the phases of the study in 1974 and 1977. In 1979, to prepare the third phase of the study, Halcrow, a British firm, was appointed to craft the system; meanwhile, a third phase of the study was published in 1981.

However, opposition from the government on the feasibility of the MRT from prominent ministers, among them Finance Minister Goh Keng Swee and Trades and Industry Minister Tony Tan, nearly shuttered the programme on financial grounds and concerns of jobs saturation in the construction industry. Dr Goh instead endorsed the idea of an all-bus system recommended by Harvard University specialists, who argued this would reduce the cost by 50% compared to the proposed MRT system. Public opinion was split on the matter: several expressed concerns about the high cost while others were more focused on increasing the standard of living. Following a debate on whether a bus-only system would be more cost-effective, Communications Minister Ong Teng Cheong came to the conclusion that an all-bus system would be inadequate, as it would have to compete for road space in a land-scarce country. Ong was an architect and town planner by training and through his perseverance and dedication became the main figure behind the initial construction of the system.

An &quot;MRT System Designs Option Study&quot; was also conducted to refine the technical details and the recommended measures for the MRT system - these include:
* Third rail is to standardise with many metros in the world instead of overhead rail in many railways of the world and MTR.
* Mandatory to have platform screen doors for safety and ventilation reasons, starting from underground stations and later on extended to elevated and surface stations.
Parsons Brinckerhoff and SOFRETU, a French firm, undertook the design options study.

===Construction begins===
Singapore&#x27;s MRT infrastructure is built, operated, and managed in accordance with a hybridised quasi-nationalised regulatory framework called the New Rail Financing Framework (NRFF), in which the lines are constructed and the assets owned by the Land Transport Authority, a statutory board of the Government of Singapore. 
The network was planned to be constructed and opened in stages, even as plans had already indicated the decision for two main arterial lines. The North–South Line was given priority because it passed through the Central Area that has a high demand for public transport. De Leuw Cather was appointed to undertake a two-year contract for consultancy in November 1982. The Mass Rapid Transit Corporation (MRTC)—later renamed SMRT Corporation—was established on 14 October 1983 and took over the roles and responsibilities of the former provisional Mass Rapid Transit Authority. On 7 November 1987, the first section of the North–South Line started operations, consisting of five stations over six kilometres. Within a year, 20 more stations had been added to the network and a direct service existed between Yishun and Lakeside stations, linking up Central Singapore to Jurong in the west by the end of 1988. The direct service was eventually split into the North–South and East–West lines after the latter&#x27;s completion of the eastern sector to Tanah Merah station. By the end of 1990, the Branch line has further linked Choa Chu Kang to the network while the inauguration of Boon Lay station on 6 July 1990 marked the completion of the initial system two years ahead of schedule.

===Subsequent expansions===
The MRT has been continuously expanded ever since. On 10 February 1996, a S$1.2 billion expansion of the North–South Line into Woodlands was completed, merging the Branch Line into the North–South Line and joining Yishun and Choa Chu Kang stations. The concept of having rail lines that bring people almost directly to their homes led to the introduction of the Light Rail Transit (LRT) lines connecting with the MRT network. On 6 November 1999, the first LRT trains on the Bukit Panjang LRT went into operation. The Expo and Changi Airport stations were opened on 10 January 2001 and 8 February 2002 respectively.

The very first infill station of the MRT network to be built on an existing line, Dover station opened on 18 October 2001. The second infill station, Canberra station opened on 2 November 2019. The third, as well as the first underground infill station, Hume opened on 28 February 2025. 

The North East Line, the first line operated by SBS Transit, opened on 20 June 2003, is one of the first fully automated heavy rail lines in the world. On 15 January 2006, after intense two-and-a-half years lobbying by the public, Buangkok station was opened, followed by Woodleigh station much later on 20 June 2011. The line&#x27;s extension to Punggol Coast was opened on 10 December 2024. The Boon Lay Extension of the East–West Line, consisting of Pioneer and Joo Koon stations, opened on 28 February 2009.

The Circle Line opened in four stages with Stage 3 on 28 May 2009, Stages 1 and 2 on 17 April 2010, Stages 4 and 5 on 8 October 2011 and the Marina Bay Extension on 14 January 2012. Stage 1 of Downtown line opened on 22 December 2013 with its official opening made on 21 December 2013 by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. Stage 2 opened on 27 December 2015, after being officially opened on 26 December by Prime Minister Lee. The Tuas West Extension of the East–West Line, consisting of Gul Circle, Tuas Crescent, Tuas West Road, and Tuas Link stations, opened on 18 June 2017. Stage 3, the final stage of the Downtown Line, opened on 21 October 2017 with its official opening made on 20 October 2017 by Coordinating Minister for Infrastructure and Minister for Transport Khaw Boon Wan. Stage 1 of the Thomson–East Coast Line opened on 31 January 2020. Stage 2 of the Thomson–East Coast Line opened on 28 August 2021, extending the line from Woodlands South to Caldecott. Stage 3 of the Thomson–East Coast Line opened on 13 November 2022, extending the line from Caldecott to Gardens by the Bay. On 23 June 2024, the line was extended eastwards terminating at Bayshore.

==Network and infrastructure==

A map of the network can be found on the Land Transport Authority&#x27;s website.

===Line names===
The lines are named based on their directions and/or locations. The names were envisioned to be user-friendly, as shown in a survey in which 70% of the respondents expressed such a preference. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) had considered other naming methods in June 2007, whether by name, colour or numbers. After the survey, however, the naming scheme was retained and used for subsequent future MRT lines.

===Facilities and services===
Except for the partly at-grade Bishan MRT station (North–South Line), the entirety of the MRT is either elevated or underground. Most below-ground stations are deep and hardened enough to withstand conventional aerial bomb attacks and to serve as bomb shelters. Mobile phone, 3G, 4G and 5G services are available in every part of the network. Underground stations and trains are air-conditioned, while above-ground stations have ceiling fans installed.

Every station is equipped with Top Up Kiosk (TUKs), a Passenger Service Centre and LED or plasma displays that show train service information and announcements. All stations are equipped with restrooms and payphones; some restrooms are located at street level. Some stations, especially the major ones, have additional amenities and services, such as retail shops and kiosks, supermarkets, convenience stores, automatic teller machines, and self-service automated kiosks for a variety of services. Most heavy-duty escalators at stations carry passengers up or down at a rate of 0.75 m/s, which is 50% faster than conventional escalators. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) announced a plan to introduce dual speeds to escalators along the North–South and East–West lines, to make it safer for senior citizens using them. As a result, all escalators on the two lines, through a refurbishment programme, will be able to operate at a different speed of 0.5 m/s during off-peak hours, with completion being targeted for 2022.

All stations constructed before 2001 initially lacked barrier-free facilities and wider AFC faregates such as lifts, ramps and tactile guidance systems for the elderly and disabled. A retrofitting programme was completed in 2006, with every station provided with at least one barrier-free access route. Over the years, additional barrier-free facilities have been constructed in stations. Since 2020, newer MRT stations have been fitted with a minimum of two lifts.

===Safety===

Operators and authorities have stated that numerous measures had been taken to ensure the safety of passengers, and SBS Transit publicised the safety precautions on the driverless North East Line before and after its opening. Safety campaign posters are highly visible in trains and stations, and the operators frequently broadcast safety announcements to passengers and to commuters waiting for trains. Fire safety standards are consistent and equivalent with the guidelines of the National Fire Protection Association in the United States.

Full-height platform screen doors were already installed in underground stations since 1987, supplied by Westinghouse. There were calls for platform screen doors to be installed at elevated stations after several incidents in which passengers were killed by oncoming trains when they fell onto the railway tracks at elevated stations. The authorities initially rejected such calls by casting doubts over functionality and concerns about the high installation costs. Nevertheless, the LTA reversed its decision and made plans to install half-height platform screen doors in all elevated stations on 25 January 2008. The first platform screen doors by ST Electronics were installed at Jurong East, Pasir Ris, and Yishun stations in 2009 under trials to test their feasibility.

By 14 March 2012, all elevated stations have been retrofitted with the doors and are operational. These doors prevent suicides and unauthorised access to restricted areas.

There were a few major incidents in the history of the MRT, which opened in 1987. On 5 August 1993, two trains collided at Clementi station because of an oil spillage on the track, which resulted in 132 injuries. During the construction of the Circle Line on 20 April 2004, a tunnel being constructed under Nicoll Highway collapsed and led to the deaths of four workers. On 15 November 2017, two trains, one being empty, collided at low speed at Joo Koon station due to a malfunction with the communications-based train control (CBTC).

Prior to the 2020 circuit breaker measures during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the public transport operators and LTA were criticised by some commuters for its delayed actions of crowd control and the enforcement of social distancing on public transport. In response, the LTA rolled out a series of precautionary measures, such as social distancing measures and making the wearing of masks in public transport mandatory. Social distancing markers were progressively implemented in the MRT trains and stations which commuters must adhere to; enforced by auxiliary officers and transport ambassadors. The significant reduction of commuters as remote work increased resulted in the transport operators reducing train frequencies and closing stations earlier from 17 April. However, train frequencies were shortly reverted to normal upon review and feedback from the public.

Since June 2020, the MRT system has resumed pre-circuit breaker operations. Regulations for social distancing on public transport are no longer applicable by law. Social distancing stickers on seats have been removed.

===Hours of operation===
MRT lines operate from 5:30am to 1:00am daily, with the exception of selected periods, such as New Year&#x27;s Eve, Chinese New Year, Deepavali, Hari Raya, Christmas, eves of public holidays and special occasions such as the state funeral of Lee Kuan Yew (2015), when most of the lines stay open throughout the night or extended till later (before the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020). Additionally, some stretches of the line end earlier, open later and close on a few days of the weekend. The nightly closures are used for maintenance. During the COVID-19 pandemic across the country, train services ended earlier from 7 April 2020 to 1 June 2020 and service extensions on the eves of public holidays ceased from 7 April 2020 until 28 September 2024 except New Year&#x27;s Eve. Train service extensions were reinstated back to before the pandemic began in 2020 as mentioned earlier.

Train frequencies are 2 - 3 mins during peak hours and 5 - 6 mins during off-peak hours. If the Christmas and New Year&#x27;s Eve falls on the weekday, train frequencies will remain the same as weekdays only during morning peak whereas it will become 5 - 6 mins until 3pm and standardised to 5 min frequency throughout the whole period until the last train.

===Architecture and art===


Early stages of the MRT&#x27;s construction paid scant attention to station design, with an emphasis on functionality over aesthetics. This is particularly evident in the first few stages of the North–South and East–West lines that opened between 1987 and 1988 from Yio Chu Kang to Clementi. An exception to this was Orchard, chosen by its designers to be a &quot;showpiece&quot; of the system and built initially with a domed roof. Architectural themes became more important only in subsequent stages, and resulted in such designs as the cylindrical station shapes on all stations between Kallang and Pasir Ris except Eunos, and west of Boon Lay, and the perched roofs at Boon Lay, Lakeside, Chinese Garden, Bukit Batok, Bukit Gombak, Choa Chu Kang, Khatib, Yishun, and Eunos stations.

Expo station, located on the Changi Airport branch of the East–West Line, is adjacent to the 100,000-square-metre Singapore Expo exhibition facility. Designed by Foster and Partners and completed in January 2001, the station features a large, pillarless, titanium-clad roof in an elliptical shape that sheathes the length of the station platform. This complements a smaller 40-metre reflective stainless-steel disc overlapping the titanium ellipse and visually floats over a glass elevator shaft and the main entrance. The other station with similar architecture is Dover.

Changi Airport station, the easternmost station on the MRT network, has the widest platform in any underground MRT station in Singapore. In 2011, it was rated 10 out of 15 most beautiful subway stops in the world by BootsnAll. Various features have been incorporated into the design to make the station aesthetically pleasing to travellers. The station is designed by architectural firm Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, featuring a large interior space and an illuminated link bridge spanning over the island platform.

Two Circle Line stations—Bras Basah and Stadium—were commissioned through the Marina Line Architectural Design Competition, which was jointly organised by the Land Transport Authority and the Singapore Institute of Architects. The competition did not require any prior architectural experience from competitors and is acknowledged by the industry as one of the most impartial competitions held in Singapore to date. The winner of both stations was WOHA. In 2009, &quot;Best Transport Building&quot; was awarded to the designers at WOHA Architects at the World Architecture Festival for their design of Bras Basah station.

Many MRT stations have specially commissioned artworks in a wide variety of art styles and mediums, including sculptures, murals and mosaics. With over 300 art pieces across 80 stations, it is Singapore&#x27;s largest public art programme.

In the early stages of the MRT, artworks were seldom included; primarily consisting of a few paintings or sculptures representing the recent past of Singapore, mounted in major stations. The opening of the Woodlands Extension introduced bolder pieces of artwork, such as a 4,000 kg sculpture in Woodlands. With the opening of the North East Line in 2003, a series of artworks under a programme called &quot;Art in Transit&quot; were commissioned by the Land Transport Authority (LTA). Created by 19 local artists and integrated into the stations&#x27; interior architecture, these works aim to promote the appreciation of public art in high-traffic environments. The artwork for each station is designed to suit the station&#x27;s identity. Subsequently, all stations on the North East, Circle and Downtown lines have taken part in this programme during their construction, with additional artworks installed at stations on other MRT lines.

==Rolling stock and signalling==
===Rolling stock===
===Signalling===

A key component of the signalling system on the MRT is the automatic train control (ATC) system, which in turn is made up of two sub-systems: the automatic train operation (ATO) and automatic train protection (ATP). The ATC has trackside and trainborne components working together to provide safe train separation by using train detection, localisation, and end of authority protection. It also provides safe train operation and movement by using train speed determination, monitoring, over-speed protection and emergency braking. The safety of alighting and departing passengers will also be provided by using a station interlocking system. The ATO drives the train in automatic mode, providing the traction and braking control demands to the train rolling stock system, adjusts its speed upon approaching the station, and provides the control of opening and closing of train and platform screen doors once the train has stopped at the station. The ATP ensures safe train separation by using the ATP track circuit status and by location determination, monitors the speed of the train to maintain safe braking distance, and initiate emergency braking in the event of overspeed. The MRT also uses an automatic train supervision system to supervise the overall operation of the train service according to a prescribed timetable or train interval.

The oldest lines, the North–South Line and East–West Line, were the only lines running with fixed block signalling. The North–South Line was upgraded to moving block/CBTC in 2017, and the East–West line upgraded in 2018. As of 27 May 2018, all MRT lines use the CBTC/moving block system in normal daily operations and from 2 January 2019, the old signalling system ceased operations. In comparison to the original fixed block system, the CBTC can reduce train intervals from 120 seconds to 100 seconds, allowing for a 20% increase in capacity and is able to support bidirectional train operations on a single track, enabling trains to be diverted onto another track in the event of a fault on one track. The CBTC system also permits for improved braking performance in wet weather as compared to the original fixed-block ATC.

All new MRT lines built since the North East Line in 2003 were equipped with CBTC from the outset, and have the capability to be completely driverless and automated, requiring no on-board staffing. Operations are monitored remotely from the operations control centre of the respective lines. Trains are equipped with intercoms to allow passengers to communicate with staff during emergencies.

===Depots===

SMRT Corporation has six train depots: Bishan Depot is the central maintenance depot for the North–South Line with train overhaul facilities, while Changi Depot and Ulu Pandan Depot inspect and house trains overnight. The newer Tuas Depot, opened in 2017, provides the East–West Line with its own maintenance facility, while Mandai Depot services trains for the Thomson–East Coast line. The underground Kim Chuan Depot houses trains for the Circle and Downtown lines, now jointly managed by the two MRT operators.

SBS Transit has three depots: Sengkang Depot houses trains for the North East line, the Sengkang LRT line, and the Punggol LRT line. Tai Seng Facility Building, connected to and located east of Kim Chuan Depot, is currently used for the Downtown line. While major operations were shifted to the main Gali Batu Depot in 2015, the Tai Seng Facility Building resumed stabling operations with the extension of the Downtown line in 2017. It currently operates independently from Kim Chuan Depot. Gali Batu Depot is the first MRT depot in Singapore to achieve the certification of Building and Construction Authority (BCA) Green Mark Gold.

In August 2014, plans for the East Coast Integrated Depot, the world&#x27;s first four-in-one train and bus depot were announced. It will be built at Tanah Merah beside the original Changi Depot site to serve the East–West, Downtown, and Thomson–East Coast lines. The new 36 ha depot can house about 220 trains and 550 buses and integrating the depot for both buses and trains will help save close to , or 60 football fields of land.

The Tengah Depot for the Jurong Region Line will be situated at the western perimeter of Tengah, and an additional depot facility will be added near Peng Kang Hill station to support the operations of the JRL. Rolling stock for the Jurong Region Line will be stabled at both facilities. Tengah Depot will house the JRL Operations Control Centre and have a bus depot integrated with it to optimise land use.

The Changi East Depot will serve the future Cross Island Line, and the depot is to be placed at the eastern end of the line.

A Singapore Rail Test Centre (formerly known as Integrated Train Testing Centre) with several test tracks for different situations and workshops for maintenance and refurbishment is also to be built at Tuas by 2022, with the main function being to test trains and integrated systems robustly before they are deployed on operational lines.

==Future expansion==
===Infrastructure===
The following table lists the upcoming lines and stations that have been officially announced:
The MRT system relied on its two main lines, the North–South and East–West lines, for more than a decade until the opening of the North East Line in 2003. While plans for these lines as well as those currently under construction were formulated long before, the Land Transport Authority&#x27;s publication of a White Paper titled &quot;A World Class Land Transport System&quot; in 1996 galvanised the government&#x27;s intentions to greatly expand the system. It called for the expansion of the 67 kilometres of track in 1995 to 360 in 2030. It was expected that daily ridership in 2030 would grow to 6.0 million from the 1.4 million passengers at that time.

New lines and extensions are mostly announced as part of the Land Transport Master Plan, which is announced every five years and outlines the government&#x27;s intentions for the future of the transport network in Singapore. The latest plan, the Land Transport Master Plan 2040, was announced on 25 May 2019, and provides for line extensions to the Downtown and Thomson–East Coast lines, a new MRT line under study, and 2 new stations on the North–South Line.

===Downtown Line===
An extension from Expo is planned to begin operations in 2026, adding an additional and 2 stations to the line, terminating at Sungei Bedok and interchanging with the Thomson–East Coast Line. Upon opening, the entire line will be long and have 37 stations in total.

On 6 January 2025, an extension to the future Sungei Kadut station was announced, including an additional unnamed station between Sungei Kadut and Bukit Panjang, slated to begin operation in 2035.

===Thomson–East Coast Line===

Stage 5 from Bedok South to Sungei Bedok is planned to be operational by 2026.

The northern terminus of Woodlands North is expected to interchange with the Johor Bahru–Singapore Rapid Transit System for greater connectivity between Johor Bahru and Woodlands, while Founders&#x27; Memorial station is an infill station along Stage 4, scheduled to open in tandem with the Founders&#x27; Memorial in 2028. In addition, this line and Canberra MRT station were the first to use top-up kiosks (TUK) that only allows cashless payments, while GTMs were retained for traditional modes of payment.

====Line extension to Changi Airport====

In addition to the previously announced alignment of the Thomson–East Coast Line, an extension has been proposed to connect it to Changi Airport, with the line passing through Terminal 5, and eventually absorbing the existing Changi Airport branch on the East–West Line. With such an extension, there would be a direct connection between Changi Airport and the city. This extension is expected to start operating by 2040. Tunneling works are tendered out by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) Singapore and Shanghai Tunnel Engineering Corporation was awarded with the tunneling package for Terminal 5.

===Jurong Region Line===

First proposed as an LRT line when originally announced in 2001, the Jurong Region Line has since been upgraded to be a medium capacity line after the project was revived in 2013. The new configuration encompasses West Coast, Tengah and Choa Chu Kang and Jurong.

====West Coast extension====
Besides the original announced alignment of the line, a West Coast extension to the Circle Line from the Jurong Region Line is currently under study, linking the West Coast region directly to Haw Par Villa, and allowing commuters on the Jurong Region Line access to the central area of the city easily. If feasible, the extension would be ready by 2030.

===Cross Island Line===

The Cross Island Line is expected to span the island of Singapore, passing through Tuas, Jurong, Sin Ming, Ang Mo Kio, Hougang, Punggol, Pasir Ris, and Changi. The new line provides commuters with another alternative for east–west travel to the current East–West Line and Downtown Line. Connected to all the other major lines, it is designed to serve as a key transfer line, complementing the role currently fulfilled by the orbital Circle Line.

Stage 1 of the line was announced in 2019 and consists of and 12 stations, and is planned to be completed in 2030. Vis-a-vis its short rail length from Aviation Park (Changi) to Bright Hill (Bishan), the project costs S$13.3 billion, and is one of the most expensive rail projects globally, to begin construction in 2022. In addition, the extension to Punggol announced in 2020 consists of three stations spanning , and is planned to be completed by 2032. Completion of the line is expected to take an even longer timeframe due to the environmental study aspects, targeted to be completed by 2030.

===Circle Line stage 6===

The extension Stage 6 from Marina Bay through Keppel, ending at HarbourFront, effectively completes the circle and links the current ends of the line, allowing for through service through the future Southern Waterfront City without the need to change to other lines. Stage 6 comprises the Keppel, Cantonment, and Prince Edward Road stations. It is slated to commence operations in the first half of 2026.

===Brickland and Sungei Kadut MRT stations===

Two new stations are planned along the existing North–South Line. Brickland station is expected to be built between Bukit Gombak and Choa Chu Kang stations, while Sungei Kadut station is expected to be built between Yew Tee and Kranji stations. Both MRT stations are expected to be completed by mid-2030s.

===Proposed ninth line along the North–East Corridor===
As part of the Land Transport Master Plan 2040, feasibility studies are ongoing for a possible ninth MRT line to link the north and northeastern regions of Singapore to the south of the island. The new line is proposed to run from Woodlands North via Sembawang, Sengkang, Seletar, Serangoon North, Whampoa, Kallang, Marina East and towards the Greater Southern Waterfront. The official alignment has yet to be confirmed.

==Fares and ticketing==

Stations are divided into two areas, &quot;paid&quot; and &quot;unpaid&quot;, which allow the rail operators to collect fares by restricting entry only through the fare gates, also known as &quot;access control gates&quot;. These gates, connected to a computer network, can read and update electronic tickets capable of storing data, and can store information such as the initial and destination stations and the duration for each trip.

The ticketing system currently utilises a mixture of Account-Based Ticketing (ABT), or SimplyGo, and legacy (non-ABT) card-based options. The station machines allow the customer to buy additional value for stored value smartcards. Such smartcards require a minimum amount of stored credit.

As the fare system has been integrated by TransitLink, commuters need to pay only one fare and pass through two fare gates (once on entry, once on exit) for an entire journey for most interchange stations, even when transferring between lines operated by different companies. Commuters can choose to extend a trip mid-journey, and pay the difference when they exit their destination station.

===Fares===
Because the rail operators are government-assisted, profit-based corporations, fares on the MRT system are pitched to at least break-even level. The operators collect these fares by selling electronic data-storing tickets, the prices of which are calculated based on the distance between the start and destination stations. These prices increase in fixed stages for standard non-discounted travel. Fares are calculated in increments based on approximate distances between stations, in contrast to the use of fare zones in other subway systems, such as the London Underground.

Although operated by private companies, the system&#x27;s fare structure is regulated by the Public Transport Council (PTC), to which the operators submit requests for changes in fares. Fares are kept affordable by pegging them approximately to distance-related bus fares, thus encouraging commuters to use the network and reduce heavy reliance on the bus system. Fare increases have caused public concern. Historically, fares on the fully underground North East, Circle, and Downtown lines had been higher than those of the North–South and East–West lines (NSEWL), a disparity that was justified by citing higher costs of operation and maintenance on a completely underground line. However, the Public Transport Council (PTC) announced in 2016 that fares for the three underground lines would be reduced to match those on the NSEWL, which took effect along with the yearly-applied fare changes, on 30 December 2016.

After the opening of Downtown line Stage 3, Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan announced that public transport fare rules would be reviewed to allow for transfers across MRT lines at different stations due to the increasing density of the rail network. At the time, commuters were charged a second time when they made such transfers. He added that the PTC would review distance-based fare transfer rules to ensure they continue to facilitate &quot;fast, seamless&quot; public transport journeys. The review of distance-based fare rules on MRT lines was completed, and a waiver on the second boarding fee incurred when making such transfers was announced on 22 March 2018. The scheme was implemented on 29 December of the same year.

===Ticketing===

The SimplyGo ABT system, accepts bank cards, mobile wallets and proprietary cards issued by EZ-Link and NETS. The legacy card-based system, that utilises the EZ-Link and NETS flashpay cards, on the &quot;Symphony for e-Payments&quot; (SeP), remains usable beyond 1 June 2024, after the government agreed to spend an extra $40 million for their continued use. The EZ-Link and NETS flashpay cards had entered into service in 2009, and replaced the FeliCa EZ-Link card. The FeliCa EZ-Link card, had in turn replaced the magnetic Transitlink farecard in 2002.

ABT using bank cards and mobile wallets, has eliminated the need for top-ups. The stored value cards using card-based, or cloud-based accounts, and issued by NETS and EZ-Link, may be purchased at the ticketing offices or merchant outlets, for immediate use. The stored value cards could be topped up from the user&#x27;s primary accounts (such as bank deposits or credit facilities), via their respective mobile applications, or other options under the terms of use. Additional credit of a predetermined value may also be automatically credited into the card when the card value runs low via an automatic recharge service provided by Interbank GIRO or credit card. An Adult Monthly Travel Card for unlimited travel on MRT, LRT, and buses may also be purchased and is non-transferable.

In 2017, TransitLink became the first public transport provider in Southeast Asia to accept contactless bank cards and the use of mobile wallets such as Apple Pay, Google Pay and Samsung Pay. The system, named SimplyGo, allows commuters to tap their contactless debit or credit cards, or smartphones/smart watches to pay for fares on the MRT, LRT and Bus network. The SimplyGo and NETS Prepaid cards were added to the system and made available to the public since 2021.

The Standard Ticket contactless smart card for single or return journeys, has been phased out completely since March 2022. It was subject to a system of deposits and surcharges: A S$0.10 deposit was levied on top of the fare to be paid. The deposit would be automatically refunded through an offset of the fare to be paid for the third journey on the same ticket while an additional discount of S$0.10 would be given for the sixth journey on the same ticket. No refund of the deposit would be provided if the card was used for fewer than 3 journeys. The ticket could be used for the purchase of single or return journeys to and from pre-selected stations up to a maximum of six journeys over 30 days. Fares for the Standard Ticket were always higher than those charged for the stored-valued CEPAS (EZ-Link and NETS FlashPay) cards for the same distance traveled. The ticket could be retained by the user after each journey and does not need to be returned.

For tourists, a Singapore Tourist Pass contactless smartcard may be purchased for use on the public transport network. The card may be bought at selected TransitLink ticket offices and Singapore Visitors Centres.

==Performance==
The MRT system did not experience any major performance issues during its first quarter-century of operations. However, there were occasional disruptions around the period from 2011 to 2018, the cause of which was often attributed to the system aging coupled with increased ridership due to population growth.

Beginning with the train disruptions in 2011, this incident led to a committee of inquiry which uncovered serious shortcomings in SMRT&#x27;s maintenance regime. For the December 2011 disruptions, the Land Transport Authority imposed a maximum penalty of S$2 million on SMRT (approximately US$1.526 million) for the two train disruptions along the North–South line on 15 and 17 December 2011. A Committee of Inquiry discovered shortcomings in the maintenance regime and checks, prompting then-CEO Saw Phaik Hwa to resign.

A much larger power-related incident than the December 2011 event occurred on 7 July 2015, when train services on both the North–South and East–West lines were shut down in both directions following a major power trip. The disruption lasted for more than 3 hours, affecting 413,000 commuters. This was considered the worst disruption to the MRT network since it first began operations in 1987 – surpassing the December 2011 event. Independent experts from Sweden and Japan were hired to conduct investigation into the cause of the disruption. The cause was identified as damage to a third rail insulator due to a water leak at Tanjong Pagar station. Consequently, a program was implemented to replace insulators liable to similar failure. For the July 2015 disruption, LTA imposed a higher penalty of S$5.4 million on SMRT.

On 22 March 2016, a fatal accident occurred off Pasir Ris station. Two of SMRT&#x27;s track-maintenance trainee staff were lethally run over by an approaching C151 at a signalling box of the station. They were part of a technical team of 15 staff led by a supervisor and were asked to go down to the tracks to investigate an alarm triggered by a possible signalling equipment fault. The operator said the team had permission to access the tracks, but did not coordinate with a signal unit in the station control to ensure train captains in the area where the team was exercised caution while pulling into Pasir Ris station. This incident resulted in a 2.5-hour service disruption between Tanah Merah and Pasir Ris Stations, affecting at least 10,000 commuters.

On 7 October 2017, a dilapidated float and pump system at Bishan station caused a tunnel flood after heavy torrential rainstorms. It was the worst train disruption since 2011 and was the first ever flooding incident in the history of the MRT. This resulted in criticism on the public transport operators among Singaporeans once again, and a huge debate about the &quot;high rankings&quot; that manage the system, with calls being made for the resignation of then Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan. Urban transport expert Park Byung Joon from the Singapore University of Social Sciences added that the negligence displayed by SMRT in this regard was tantamount to a criminal offence, and after an internal investigation, found that the maintenance crew of the Bishan Station&#x27;s pump system had submitted maintenance records for nearly a year without actually carrying out the works.

On 25 September 2024, a major train disruption occurred when an eastbound train on the East-West Line (EWL) suffered a fault near Clementi station. After disembarking its passengers and upon reaching Ulu Pandan Depot, it started to smoke and created a power trip. The resulting incident shut down all EWL train services between Boon Lay and Queenstown, with the LTA and SMRT delaying reopening services for 2 days, making it the longest MRT train disruption in Singaporean history. Normal train service is expected to resume on the following Monday, 30 September 2024.

===Responses===
The December 2011 disruptions brought the state of public transportation as a whole to national prominence among Singaporeans, who had previously considered the system to be reliable and robust since its inception in 1987. LTA also noted a marked increase in dissatisfaction with public transport with the release of the 2012 Public Transport Customer Satisfaction Survey, and promised government action to deal with issues relating to system disruptions.

The government reviewed the penalties for train disruptions, and made free travel available for all bus services passing MRT stations affected during any train disruptions. Exits were also made free. In addition, to increase satisfaction with public transport, free off-peak morning travel, later changed to a discount, was introduced with further improvements continuing to be discussed.

Since 2018, efforts in both maintenance and renewal are starting to pay off with the MRT system clocking an average of 690,000 km between delays in 2018 – a 3.8 times improvement than in 2017. The North–South line, which was hit by the tunnel flood in 2017, in particular saw its train-km between delays increase by ten-fold from 89,000 km between delays in 2017 to 894,000 km in 2018. By July 2019, the Mean Kilometres Between Failure (MKBF) for the North–South and East–West lines had jumped to 700,000 km and 1,400,000 km respectively. The new challenges encountered by the government were now on keeping the funding of such renewals required sustainable in the decades ahead.

==Security==


Security concerns related to crime and terrorism were not high on the agenda of the system&#x27;s planners at its inception. After the Madrid train bombings in 2004 and the foiled plot to bomb the Yishun MRT station in 2001, the operators deployed private, unarmed guards to patrol station platforms and conduct checks on the belongings of commuters, especially those carrying bulky items.

Recorded announcements are frequently made to remind passengers to report suspicious activity and not to leave their belongings unattended, and since 2023; to remind people on voyeurism such as molestation and taking of upskirt photos.

Digital closed-circuit cameras (CCTVs) have been upgraded with recording-capability at all stations and trains operated by SMRT Corporation. Trash bins and mail boxes have been removed from station platforms and concourse levels to station entrances, to eliminate the risk of bombs planted in them. While photography and filming is allowed at all of the public areas (except train depots where it is gazetted as restricted areas by law), station staff may conduct checks and interviews to ensure that they are not intended to be used for criminal activities such as taking of upskirt photos. Staff and police may reserve the right to stop these activities.

In 2005, the Singapore Police Force announced plans to step up rail security by establishing a specialised security unit for public transport, then known as the Police MRT unit. The unit today expanded to become Public Transport Security Command (TRANSCOM) since 2009. These armed officers began overt patrols on the MRT and LRT systems on 15 August 2005, conducting random patrols in pairs in and around stations and within trains. They are trained and authorised to use their firearms at their discretion, including deadly force if deemed necessary. The unit over time went on to handle other crimes committed on the MRT network, such as theft and molestation. Recently, on its tenth anniversary in 2019, it has formally evolved to become a hybrid, community-based force, and has launched an initiative to get commuters to aid Transcom officers. Since then, 26,000 people have volunteered, far above the 3000 target.

Civil exercises are regularly conducted to maintain preparedness for contingencies. In January 2006, Exercise Northstar V involved over 2,000 personnel from 22 government agencies responding to simulated bombings and chemical attacks at Dhoby Ghaut, Toa Payoh, Raffles Place and Marina Bay stations. In August 2013, Exercise Greyhound tested the response of SBS Transit&#x27;s Operations Control Centre and the implementation of its contingency plans for bus bridging, free bus service and deployment of goodwill ambassadors (GAs) during a simulated prolonged train service disruption. About 300 personnel including representatives from LTA, SBST, SMRT, the Singapore Police Force&#x27;s Transport Command (TransCom), Traffic Police and Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) participated in the exercise.

Security concerns were brought up by the public when two incidents of vandalism at train depots occurred within two years. In both incidents, graffiti on the affected trains was discovered after they entered revenue service.
The first incident, on 17 May 2010, involved a breach in the perimeter fence of Changi Depot and resulted in the imprisonment and caning of a Swiss citizen, and an Interpol arrest warrant for his accomplice. SMRT Corporation received a S$50,000 fine by the Land Transport Authority for the first security breach. Measures were put in place by the Public Transport Security Committee to enhance depot security in light of the first incident, but works were yet to be completed by SMRT Corporation when the second incident, on 17 August 2011, occurred at Bishan Depot.

==Regulations==

Under the &quot;Rapid Transit Systems Act&quot;, acts such as smoking, consumption of any food or drink, including sweets and plain water in stations and trains, misuse of emergency equipment, unauthorised photography or filming of railway assets and trespassing onto railway tracks or into train depots are illegal, with penalties ranging from fines to imprisonment and possibly caning. Some commentators have suggested that SMRT&#x27;s strict enforcement of the total ban on the consumption of any food or drink, including sweets and plain water, especially during hot weather or against persons with legitimate needs (such as where consumption of food or drink is needed for medical reasons), is disproportionate and unnecessary.

===Priority seats===
There are generally a number of seats in each MRT carriage designated as &#x27;priority seats&#x27; located near the train doors which are intended to be used by the elderly, pregnant women, parents with infants and others with mobility problems. The use of such seats by persons who do not fit the foregoing description or who do not outwardly appear to be in need of a seat on the MRT, has repeatedly been the subject of public debate in Singapore.

In 2019, the LTA launched the &quot;May I have a seat please?&quot; initiative. Under the initiative, upon request, LTA provides commuters with non-visible health conditions or disabilities or short-term or temporary conditions (such as where they are on medical leave), with a lanyard or sticker respectively reading &quot;May I have a seat please?&quot;.

<text>Parliamentary elections were held in Serbia on 28 December 2003 to elect members of the National Assembly.

Serbia had been in a state of political crisis since the overthrow of the post-communist ruler, Slobodan Milošević, in 2001. The reformers, led by former Yugoslav President Vojislav Koštunica, have been unable to gain control of the Serbian presidency because three successive presidential elections have failed to produce the required 50% turnout. The assassination in March 2003 of reformist Prime Minister, Zoran Đinđić was a major setback.

At these elections the former reformist alliance, the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS), had broken up into three parts: Koštunica&#x27;s Democratic Party of Serbia, late Prime Minister Đinđić&#x27;s Democratic Party and the G17 Plus group of liberal economists led by Miroljub Labus.

Opposing them were the nationalist Serbian Radical Party of Vojislav Šešelj and Milošević&#x27;s Socialist Party of Serbia (descended from the former Communist Party). At the time of the election, both Šešelj and Milošević were in detention at ICTY, Milošević accused of committing war crimes, Šešelj of inspiring them.

The remaining candidate was the monarchist Serbian Renewal Movement–New Serbia (SPO–NS) coalition, led by Vuk Drašković.

Following the election the three former DOS parties (DSS, DS and G17+) fell two seats short of a parliamentary majority, holding 124 seats between them. After months of coalition talks Koštunica, Labus and Drašković&#x27;s parties reach an agreement with the outside support of the Socialist Party in March 2004 which enabled Koštunica of the DSS to become prime minister.

<doc id="416501" wikidata="Q4636738" url="?curid=416501" title="3rd Division (Australia)">
<text>The 3rd Division was an infantry division of the Australian Army. Existing during various periods between 1916 and 1991, it is considered the &quot;longest serving Australian Army division&quot;. It was first formed during World War I, as an infantry division of the Australian Imperial Force and saw service on the Western Front in France and Belgium. During this time it fought major battles at Messines, Broodseinde Ridge, Passchendaele, Amiens, and the St Quentin Canal.

The division was demobilised in 1919 before being re-raised in 1921 as part of the Citizen Forces, based in central Victoria. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the division&#x27;s establishment fluctuated due to the effects of the Great Depression and a general apathy towards military matters.

During World War II, the division was mobilised for war in December 1941 and initially undertook defensive duties in Australia before being deployed to New Guinea in 1943 where they took part in the Salamaua–Lae campaign against the Japanese in 1943–1944, before returning to Australia for rest and reorganisation. In late 1944 they were sent to Bougainville to take part in the Bougainville campaign the final campaign of the war. There they undertook a series of advances across the island before the war came to an end in August 1945.

Following the end of hostilities the division was disbanded in December 1945 as part of the demobilisation process, but was it later re-raised in 1948 as part of the Citizens Military Force. It subsequently served through the Cold War as a reserve formation until 1991 when the division was disbanded for a final time as the Australian Army was restructured and the focus of Australian field force operations shifted from the divisions to brigades.
==History==

===World War I===

====Formation and training====
In early 1916, following the unsuccessful Gallipoli campaign, the decision was made to expand the size of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF). At the time there were two divisions in Egypt—the 1st and 2nd—and of these, one of them (the 1st) was split up to provide a cadre upon which to raise the 4th and 5th Divisions. Around this time the decision to raise a fifth division from fresh volunteers in Australia was also made and as a result the 3rd Division was officially raised on 2 February 1916.

Upon formation, the division drew its personnel from all Australian states and consisted of three four-battalion infantry brigades—the 9th, 10th and the 11th—and a number of supporting elements including engineers, artillery and medical personnel. Only rudimentary initial training was undertaken before elements of the division began the embarkation process in May and June 1916 as they were moved to the United Kingdom, where the individual sub units concentrated for the first time, received arms and other equipment and began the task of undertaking further training at Larkhill, in the Salisbury Plain Training Area. In July the division&#x27;s artillery component was formed, consisting of three batteries of 18-pounders and one 4.5 inch howitzer battery. The process of raising and training took some time and consequently the division was not transferred to France until mid November 1916. Prior to this, however, the division endured proposals to break it up to provide reinforcements to the other four Australian divisions that were already in France. Although these threats passed, in early September 1916, following losses around Pozières, almost 3,000 men from the 3rd Division were transferred. Throughout October it seemed likely that further drafts would be siphoned away from the division, however, this did not occur and in early November two divisional exercises were undertaken. Finally, on 21 November 1916, the 3rd Division crossed the English Channel and arrived in France.

Under the command of Major General John Monash, the division was assigned to II ANZAC Corps. For the next two years they would take part in most of the major battles that the Australians fought on the Western Front. Initially they were deployed around Armentières in a &quot;quiet&quot; sector of the line, where they gained their first experiences of trench warfare, conducting patrols into No Man&#x27;s Land and minor raids on the German trenches opposite them during the winter months.

====Early engagements, 1917====
By January 1917 the 3rd Division&#x27;s artillery had been reorganised so that it consisted of two field artillery brigades, each of which consisted of three six-gun 18-pounder batteries and twelve 4.5 inch howitzers. These brigades were the 7th (consisting of the 25th, 26th, 27th and 107th Batteries) and the 8th (29th, 30th, 31st and 108th Batteries). In April 1917 the division was moved to the Messines–Wytschaete Ridge section of the line in Belgium, taking up a position on the extreme right of II ANZAC Corps, with the New Zealand Division to its left. It was here, in early June 1917, that the division undertook its first major engagement of the war when it was committed to the fighting during the Battle of Messines. Monash tasked the 9th and 10th Brigades to provide the assault force for the 3rd Division&#x27;s part of the operation, while the 11th Brigade was to act as the divisional reserve.

As the division&#x27;s assault units began their approach march towards the Line of Departure late on the evening of 6 June, the German artillery opened up with a gas bombardment that severely hindered the march, breaking up the assaulting units as men became lost. Suffering over 2,000 casualties before the battle even began, many of the division&#x27;s assault units reached their assembly points with less than 200 men, nevertheless they arrived on time and at the appointed hour, after a number of mines were exploded in front of their positions, the assault began. The exploding mines had destroyed a large part of the German line and as a result initial resistance was quickly overcome by the division&#x27;s lead battalions—the 33rd, 34th, 38th and 39th—and by 5 am, the division had gained the crest of the Messines ridge and began digging in to defend against a possible counter-attack. In the engagements that followed the division largely played only a supporting role.

Following this, the division&#x27;s next major engagement came on 4 October 1917 when it took part in the Battle of Broodseinde Ridge. This time the 9th Brigade was held back in reserve, while the 10th and 11th Brigades led the division forward. Attacking on the left of the Australian 2nd Division and the right of the New Zealand Division, early on the morning of the scheduled start of the attack the German artillery opened up on the division&#x27;s eight assaulting infantry battalions as they stood to in the open ready to step off. Conserving their artillery for the main attack, the supporting Allied artillery only provided limited counter-battery fire and the division suffered heavily as they were forced to endure an hour-long barrage before zero hour came at 6 am. As the 37th and 43rd Battalions led the advance towards the German lines, supported by small teams of mortarmen and machine gunners, the Germans launched their own attack, however, the Australian assault had taken them by surprise and after some initial resistance, the German assault troops began to fall back or surrender. As the follow-on battalions exploited the ground gained in the initial assault the advance continued and by 9:15 am the 3rd Division had carried the ridge and begun to dig in, having advanced . A counterattack late in the day on the 11th Brigade&#x27;s position was turned back, sealing a stunning success for the 3rd Division. Nevertheless, the division&#x27;s casualties were high, with over 1,800 men killed or wounded. For his actions during the attack, Walter Peeler, a Lewis-gunner from the 3rd Pioneer Battalion who was attached to 37th Battalion for anti-aircraft duties received the Victoria Cross after he personally led the assault on a number of German positions.

They held the line for a further three days before being withdrawn for rest and reorganisation. On 10 October 1917 the division returned to the front and began to make preparations to assault Passchendaele Ridge, an advance of over . Heavy rain, however, had turned the battlefield into a thick, muddy morass and as a result transportation and resupply efforts were hampered as were attempts to reposition the supporting artillery and as a consequence when the attack went in at 5:25 am on 12 October the 9th and 10th Brigades had only limited fire support. With only a fraction of the guns required and limited ammunition, the artillery that was supposed to provide a creeping barrage behind which the infantry were to advance could only provide a thin bombardment. Nevertheless, the mud was so thick that the infantry were unable to keep up with the barrage and, unable to maintain the required rate of advance, they eventually they fell behind the barrage and lost any cover that it might otherwise have provided.

Upon reaching the Bellevue Spur, the assaulting infantry, caught in the open upon the barbed wire in front of the German positions, suffered heavily at the hands of the German artillery that was able to fire without answer from the British batteries that had run out of ammunition. Nevertheless, the 10th Brigade managed to reach its first objective, as did the 9th which even pushed on to its second, however, as they began to receive enfilade fire from their left flank where the New Zealand Division&#x27;s attack had ground to a halt, the Germans began massing for a counterattack and the Australian positions quickly became untenable. On the division&#x27;s right flank another gap had begun to develop as they lost contact with the Australian 4th Division and as a result the order to retire was passed. As they returned to the start line, the assault units were relieved by the 11th Brigade, which had formed the divisional reserve. By the end of the day, the division had lost almost 3,200 men killed or wounded. They played no further offensive role in the battle and were eventually removed from the line on 22 October as the Canadians took over from them.

The fighting around Passchendaele proved to be the division&#x27;s last offensive actions for 1917 and they spent the winter months in the rear training, or undertaking defensive duties in reasonably quiet sectors of the line as they were reformed and brought back up to strength. Around this time also, the five Australian divisions on the Western Front were reorganised into a unified command structure under the Australian Corps.

====German Spring Offensive, 1918====

In March 1918 the Germans launched their Spring Offensive near Saint-Quentin and as the Allied line collapsed, the German forces advanced swiftly into the Somme valley. Believing that another attack would be directed against the forces in the Flanders sector, in an effort to reinforce the British forces there, the Allied commanders recalled the 3rd Division was recalled from its quiet sector around Armentières and sent it to Ypres. The attack came, however, at the Somme and so on 24 March the division was transferred south to help stem the advance and defend the approaches towards the important railhead at Amiens. Temporarily placed under the command of the British VII Corps, the division took up position to the east of Amiens in between the Ancre and Somme Rivers.

Lacking any reserves and possessing only limited artillery support, the division&#x27;s engineers prepared the bridges over the rivers for detonation. From 27 March onwards minor actions were fought along the line as the German advance began to reach the Australians. On 30 March, during the First Battle of Morlancourt, a serious attempt at penetrating the line around Sailly-Laurette was held and broken up by the 11th Brigade, with German losses being assessed at around one and a half brigades, or roughly between 3,000 and 4,000 men. Meanwhile, the 9th Brigade was detached from the division and sent south, where it participated in a counter-attack around Villers-Bretonneux. On 6 April, further attempts were made and in the confusion the charges that had been placed on the Bouzencourt Bridge were fired and it was dropped into the Somme Canal. Nevertheless, the attempt was beaten off by the 10th Brigade. Following this the Australians were able to begin taking the initiative and throughout May they began to slowly recapture some of the ground that had been lost earlier as they undertook a series of Peaceful Penetration operations, including the Second Battle of Morlancourt.

In June 1918, the 3rd Division&#x27;s commander, Monash, was promoted to take over command of the Australian Corps and as a result Major General John Gellibrand took over as divisional commander.

====Battle of Amiens, 1918====

On 8 August 1918, the Allies launched their Hundred Days Offensive around Amiens and the 3rd Division was tasked with leading the Australian Corps part in the attack. By this stage, the divisional artillery consisted of three field brigades, and under the cover of a heavy artillery bombardment provided by nine field brigades that were organised in three supporting sub-groups, and supported by tanks and gas, the attack began at 4:20 am. The weight of the Allied fire support was intense as over 2,000 artillery pieces opened up on the German defences. The assaulting infantry battalions were each assigned a frontage of about which they assaulted with two companies forward and two in support. Thick smoke meant that the attackers found it difficult to maintain their spacing and some of the supporting armour was also delayed. Nevertheless, the attack proved successful, as the Australians overwhelmed the German defenders and by the end of the day the division had achieved all of its objectives.

Throughout the rest of August, they continued offensive operations, even launching daylight raids upon the German positions. On 22 August they attacked once more, advancing through the village of Bray, capturing a number of German prisoners. After a brief lull in the fighting, they continued the advance again on 25 August capturing Clery at the end of the week before taking Allaines on 2 September. Throughout September the Germans began to withdraw back towards the Hindenburg Line and the 3rd Division took part in the operations undertaken to follow them up and harass the rearguard. Casualties during this phase had been high, however, and as a result the division&#x27;s pioneers were used as infantry and even led the advance towards Buire on 6 September.

As operations continued throughout the month, casualties amongst the Australian Corps became critical and the decision was made to disband some of the 3rd Division&#x27;s battalions and use them to reinforce the remaining units. This decision saw the reduction of the strength of division&#x27;s infantry brigades from four battalions to three, bringing the Australians into line with the British, who had made a similar decision earlier in the war. Nevertheless, the decision was not popular amongst the soldiers and when the 42nd Battalion received the order to disband, the attempt was rejected by its personnel and the order disobeyed. As a result, the proposed reorganisation was postponed until after the division&#x27;s final offensive actions were fought in early October 1918. These came around the St Quentin Canal when the division attacked the Beaurevoir Line in concert with American troops from the US 27th Division, who would lead the assault in. The attack went awry, however, when the lead assault units failed to adequately clear the forward positions and subsequently when the 3rd Division was committed they came under fire almost immediately and instead of passing through the American positions, they had to complete the mopping up process before they could advance. Nevertheless, by nightfall on 1 October, the division had captured the northern end of the tunnel that ran under the canal.

On 2 October the majority of the 3rd Division was removed from the line for rest and reorganisation, although a number of its artillery batteries would continue to support the operations of the II American Corps until they were withdrawn. Following this they continued to participate in the fighting in support of the British 6th Division. The 27th Battery fired the division&#x27;s last shot of the war on 4 November at Wassigny. Nevertheless, the division was out of the line when news of the Armistice came on 11 November 1918. Following the end of hostilities the demobilisation process began and as men were repatriated back to Australia, the division was eventually disbanded on 28 May 1919.

===Inter-war years===

Following the end of the war, the AIF was disbanded and the focus of Australia&#x27;s military forces was the units of the Citizens Force. Between 1918 and 1921, as the demobilisation process was completed, this force existed in a state of flux, however, in 1921 planning for the post war Army was finally completed. On 1 May 1921 the 3rd Division was re-raised in Victoria as part of the 3rd Military District. Upon formation it consisted of three four-battalion brigades—the 4th Brigade, 10th Brigade and 15th Brigade—and various supporting units including artillery, engineers, signals, transport and medical.

At this time, the existing infantry battalions of the Citizens Force were redesignated to perpetuate the numerical designations of the AIF, and although an attempt was made to allocate these designations based on regional considerations, ultimately this was not always possible and ultimately when the 3rd Division was re-established, only two of its component battalions—the 37th and 39th Battalions—had previously been assigned to the division.

With a peacetime establishment of about 16,000 personnel (18,400 upon mobilisation), the division was brought up to strength through the compulsory training scheme. Initially the system worked well and a number of the division&#x27;s subunits reported being above establishment, however, this did not last long. In 1922, the Washington Naval Treaty was signed and theoretically alleviated Australia&#x27;s security concerns about Japanese expansion in the Pacific. As a result, the Army&#x27;s budget was halved and as the scope of the compulsory training scheme was scaled back, the authorised strength of each infantry battalion was reduced to just 409 men of all ranks. The division&#x27;s artillery was also reduced, with one field battery in each artillery brigade being disbanded at this time. As a result of the subsequent reorganisation, the 3rd Division&#x27;s artillery consisted of three artillery brigades, the 2nd, 4th and 8th.

In 1929 the compulsory training scheme was suspended following the election of the Scullin Labor government. In its place a new system was introduced whereby the Citizens Force would be maintained on a part-time, voluntary basis only. It was also renamed the &quot;Militia&quot; at this time. The decision to suspend compulsory training, coupled with the economic downturn of the Great Depression meant that the manpower of many Militia units dropped considerably and as a result a number of units were amalgamated. As a part of this process, the division was reduced from 12 infantry battalions to nine as six battalions were merged to form new amalgamated units—29th/22nd, 37th/52nd and 57th/60th Battalions. To a large extent, however, these were hollow structures and by 1931 the 3rd Division&#x27;s overall establishment was just 4,505 men all ranks.

Throughout the 1930s the number of active personnel remained low and out of necessity training opportunities were limited. After 1936, however, the Army attempted to improve the conditions of service for its members and to reinvigorate the training program, while individual units began to undertake their own recruiting campaigns. Nevertheless, it was not until 1938, as tensions grew in Europe and the prospect of war became more likely, that an attempt was made to expand the establishment of the Militia. At this time an effort was made to determine the readiness of the Militia to expand if mobilised. During the continuous training camps undertaken throughout 1938, each component unit was assessed with mixed results. The following year, 1939, saw further expansion and by the end of April of that year, the division&#x27;s posted strength had grown to 9,589 personnel. As a part of this expansion, the divisional artillery was expanded by the re-raising of the batteries that had been disbanded in 1922.

===World War II===

====Home duties====
On 3 September 1939, Australia found itself once again at war, after attempts at finding a diplomatic solution to the German invasion of Poland had failed. Following the outbreak of World War II, mobilisation began slowly as the government called up a force of about 8,000 Militia personnel to undertake security duties in the days following the declaration of war. A short time later, the decision was made to raise an all volunteer force for overseas service, known as the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF). This was necessary due to the provisions of the &quot;Defence Act (1903)&quot; which precluded deploying the Militia outside of Australian territory, and as a result the government decided to use the Militia to provide a small cadre upon which the 2nd AIF would be raised, as well as to provide training to conscripts as part of the compulsory training scheme which was re-established in early 1940. Nevertheless, during this time large numbers of officers and senior non-commissioned officers from the 3rd Division volunteered for service with the 2nd AIF and many units lost a large number of their experienced personnel at this time.

Throughout 1940–41, the Militia were called up in cohorts for periods of continuous training, and the 3rd Division, still consisting of the 4th, 10th and 15th Brigades, undertook a series of training camps around Seymour, Victoria. In March 1941, the division&#x27;s artillery was reorganised to bring it in line with the British organisational system with each artillery brigade being converted to a field regiment. Numerical designations stayed the same, however, and by late 1941 the division had completed its transition. This saw its infantry brigades once again reduced from four battalions to three, while various supporting elements were inserted at brigade-level, however, training at this time was still rudimentary and limited mainly to individual skills, and the division&#x27;s establishment was recorded as being only half of its authorised wartime establishment. There was also a shortage of modern equipment.

With Japan&#x27;s entry into the war following the attacks on Pearl Harbor and Malaya, it became more likely that the division would be called upon to undertake active service overseas, and the division was mobilised for war. In early January 1942, Major General Stanley Savige, an experienced officer who had commanded the 17th Brigade in combat against the Germans in the Middle East earlier in the war, took over command of the division. Savige set about the task of preparing the division for combat and he began by removing officers that he did not think were physically fit enough or competent to lead in battle and replacing them with men who had gained experience in AIF units. A comprehensive training program was established and in April 1942 the division was assigned to the Australian I Corps, and to enable divisional exercises to begin, the 3rd Division moved to Bonegilla, Victoria. To toughen the men up, Savige decided that they would march on foot to the new camp.

The following month they were relocated once more, this time to Queensland where they undertook training exercises and defensive duties along the coast between Brisbane and Tweed Heads on the New South Wales border. At this time, the Army began to rectify the deficiencies in the division&#x27;s equipment lists and battalions began receiving new machine guns, motor transport and Bren carriers. As the situation in New Guinea grew worse, the decision was made to reorganise the 3rd Division and throughout August, four battalions were amalgamated—the 37th, 52nd, 58th and 59th. In September, the 10th Brigade was disbanded and its battalions reallocated to the 4th and 15th Brigades. In October, the 29th and 46th Battalions were also amalgamated, leaving the division with just six infantry battalions in two brigades.

====New Guinea, 1943–1944====
In early 1943 the division was despatched to New Guinea, with the 15th Brigade being sent to Port Moresby and the 4th Brigade going to Milne Bay. At this point the 4th Brigade was reassigned to the 5th Division. It would later be replaced within the division by the 29th Brigade. The division&#x27;s stay in Port Moresby was brief and in April it began moving to Wau where they subsumed the units assigned to Kanga Force, including the 17th Brigade, a 2nd AIF formation, and began operations as part of the Salamaua–Lae campaign.

Initially operations were limited to the area immediately surrounding Bulolo, but as the division became established the headquarters was shifted to Tambu Bay and brigades were pushed out towards Mubo, and the Komiatum and Bobdui Ridges, while defensive patrols were undertaken through the Wampit Valley, around the Bulwa and Zenag airstrips and towards the Markham River. Stretched across a front of over , in June the division was reinforced by the US 162nd Infantry Regiment. Following this the division took on primary responsibility for Allied operations in New Guinea. Eventually Lae fell in September and soon afterwards, its elements were moved back to Port Moresby, before being sent to support the 7th Division&#x27;s campaign in the Markham and Ramu Valleys and the advance on Madang.

In August 1944 the 3rd Division&#x27;s brigades were withdrawn back to Australia for leave and reorganisation. After this, preparations began for the division&#x27;s next campaign. Around this time, the 3rd Division adopted the Jungle divisional establishment, and was reorganised around three infantry brigades: the 7th, 15th and 29th Brigades. It was also assigned to the Australian II Corps.

====Bougainville 1944–1945====
In late 1944 it was decided that the Australians would take over responsibility from the Americans for operations against the Japanese on Bougainville. From November–December 1944, the 3rd Division, along with two independent brigades, the 11th and 23rd, began to relieve the units of the US XIV Corps that were to be transferred elsewhere in the Pacific. Allied intelligence of Japanese strengths on the island varied at the time, although it was believed that there were around 17,500 Japanese on Bougainville. Although this was later proved to be grossly incorrect, nevertheless the Allies believed that the Japanese formations in the area, despite being under strength, were still capable of carrying out effective combat operations. As a result, it was decided that II Corps would go on the offensive to clear the Japanese from the island and a three pronged campaign was planned in the northern, central and southern sectors of the island.

The division was supported by a number of artillery units including the 2nd and 4th Field Regiments and the 2nd Mountain Battery, and various anti-aircraft units. Later, also &#x27;U&#x27; Heavy Battery, with four 155 mm howitzers was transferred from Lae, as was the 2/11th Field Regiment. To provide organic fire support during the advance, the decision was made at this time to place the divisional artillery assets directly underneath the subunits they were supporting. At the outset, the division&#x27;s allocation of engineers consisted of only two field companies, the 5th and 11th, however over the course of the campaign others arrived including the 10th, 15th and the 7th, which was the last to arrive in June 1945. Ultimately the division had almost 1,600 engineers across five field companies and various supporting plant, park and other units. This represented one of the largest engineer contingents within an Australian division during the war. Initially the division was deployed without armoured support. However, in December 1944, &#x27;B&#x27; Squadron, 2/4th Armoured Regiment, equipped with Matilda II tanks, arrived and subsequently took part in operations on the island attached to elements of the division.

The 7th Brigade, supported by the 2nd Field Regiment, was the first to commence operations, as the 9th Battalion launched a surprise attack in the central sector of the island upon a Japanese outpost at Little George Hill on 25 November. The following month the battalion seized control of Artillery Hill, while the 29th Brigade began patrolling operations in the southern sector.

Following the capture of Pearl Ridge by the 25th Battalion, the focus of the 3rd Division&#x27;s operations on Bougainville was shifted on the northern and southern sectors. The 11th Brigade, independent of the 3rd Division, assumed control of the drive to the north, while the 3rd Division concentrated on the drive south towards Buin, where the main Japanese force was concentrated. Rotating his brigades, the division&#x27;s commander, Major General William Bridgeford, advanced south from Torokina towards the Puriata river. After crossing it, the Japanese launched a significant counterattack around Slater&#x27;s Knoll, which was eventually beaten off in early April.

In April 1945 the 15th Brigade took over from the 7th Brigade and resumed the advance on the Hongorai and Mivo rivers. In early July, the 29th Brigade relieved the 15th and continued the advance and as they attempted to cross the Mivo, the Japanese launched a ferocious counter-attack upon the 15th Battalion which was turned back by desperate defence. Following this the advance came to a halt as torrential rain turned the axis of advance into &quot;a sea of mud&quot; and many of the bridges upon which the Australian supply system was dependent were washed away. As the situation became worse, briefly even patrolling operations had to be stopped. These patrols were resumed, however, in late July and into August, as isolated pockets of Japanese began to attack the 3rd Division&#x27;s supply lines and support units. As preparations were made to resume the advance, the dropping of two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and Japan&#x27;s subsequent unconditional surrender brought the fighting on Bougainville to an end and a cease fire came into effect.

Following the end of hostilities, the demobilisation process began and eventually the 3rd Division was disbanded on 4 December 1945. During the division&#x27;s campaign in Bougainville, one of its soldiers, Reg Rattey, earned the Victoria Cross for his actions during the fighting around Slater&#x27;s Knoll. Some personnel from the division later served in the 67th Infantry Battalion, undertaking occupation duties as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan.

===Cold War===
In 1948, with demobilisation of Australia&#x27;s wartime army complete, the decision was made to re-raise the part-time forces of the Militia, albeit with the new name of the Citizens Military Force (CMF), and on a reduced establishment of two infantry divisions, an armoured brigade and various corps-level support units. During this time the 3rd Division was re-raised and based around a nucleus of three infantry brigades—the 4th, 6th and 9th Brigades—it was once again based in central Victoria, although subunits were also based in South Australia and Tasmania. Once again the division&#x27;s component units bore little resemblance to those that had fought with it during the two World Wars. Service in the post war CMF was initially on a voluntary basis and recruitment remained poor until 1951 when conscription was introduced once again in an effort to improve the readiness of the Australian military during the Korean War. The 3rd Division was not deployed during this time, however, and although national service was instituted, service in Korea was undertaken on a voluntary basis, and conscription was used only as a means to expand the CMF and provide a base upon which mobilisation could be achieved if it proved necessary.

Nevertheless, the resulting influx of manpower revitalised the CMF to the point that during the 1950s the division experienced a remarkable level of manning and resources that saw many units achieve full strength, with full equipment allocations. On 23 March 1958 a divisional parade was conducted at Puckapunyal, bringing together all of the division&#x27;s Victorian-based units in a concentration of force not seen in the division since 1916. The following year the division conducted a live-fire exercise at Puckapunyal based upon the 4th Brigade and involving over 3,500 men, tanks, artillery, aircraft, and various supporting arms. Despite the success demonstrated by the exercise, it would be the last time that the division mounted something similar the national service scheme was modified to limit the size of each yearly intake of trainees and the size of the CMF was reduced by over 30,000 men in an effort to free up Regular personnel to raise the 1st Brigade. The 1957 reforms, however, did not achieve the efficiencies required to free up Regular personnel to meet the strategic requirements to maintain a regular field force that was ready to respond to the exigencies of the Cold War. As a result, in 1959 the decision was made to suspend national service as it was realised that further changes were required to expand the size of the Regular army. Further changes came with the introduction of the Pentropic divisional establishment into the Australian Army. This saw the reduction of the Army to just two divisions, the 1st and 3rd Divisions, and as a part of this the division was reorganised into five battalion-plus sized battle groups, and resulted in the removal of brigade-level formations and the disbandment and amalgamation of a number of smaller regionally based infantry battalions, into larger units that were part of State-based regiments.

With an authorised peacetime establishment of 13,621 personnel, the 3rd Division included formations in five different military command districts including Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia as well as those in South Australia, Tasmania and Victoria. The main infantry components at this time were: 2nd Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment (RQR); 1st Battalion, Royal Victoria Regiment (RVR); 2nd Battalion, RVR; 1st Battalion, Royal South Australia Regiment (RSAR); and 1st Battalion, Royal Western Australia Regiment.

The Australian Army&#x27;s experiment with the Pentropic establishment did not last long, however, as it created a number of planning issues including lack of interoperability with other Western allies, none of whom used it. As a result, it was abandoned in late 1964 and into early 1965 and the 3rd Division was once again reorganised. The resulting changes saw the establishment of brigade-level formations, briefly known as &quot;task forces&quot;, however, due to other planning considerations only one was raised for the 3rd Division at this time: the 4th Task Force, consisting of four infantry battalions: 1, 2, 5 and 6 RVR.

At the same time, the Australian government announced that the national service scheme would be implemented once again, however, instead of focusing upon expanding the CMF, the scheme was set up so that national servicemen would serve limited terms of service in Australian Regular Army (ARA) units with a view to service overseas in Vietnam and Malaysia. This highlighted the changing focus of Australia&#x27;s military planning towards Regular forces, however, it had a negative impact upon the division as essentially it was forced to compete with the ARA for manpower and although some gains were made from men that chose to serve longer national service terms in the CMF to defer their service in ARA units, these were negligible and arguably of limited quality. The government&#x27;s decision not to deploy CMF units to these conflicts meant that many of the division&#x27;s experienced personnel chose to transfer to ARA units to gain operational experience, although some attempts were made to rectify this situation by offering CMF officers the opportunity to undertake a short attachment to an ARA unit serving in Vietnam and a number of 3rd Division officers took up this opportunity, a few even saw combat.

When the national service scheme was ended following the election of the Whitlam government in late 1972, the 3rd Division lost a large number of personnel. At this time, the division&#x27;s artillery assets included two artillery field regiments, a medium regiment, and a divisional locating battery, and although on paper the division was a large, combined arms formation, in reality many of its units were hollow and inadequately equipped, and in the decades following this the division, and indeed the CMF in general, underwent a period of uncertainty as the government attempted to solve the issues that the organisation faced, the most pressing of which was the question of its role and strategic relevance, as well as those concerning conditions of service, centralisation of training and access to equipment.

In 1976 the division&#x27;s combat strength had dropped to the extent that it was really only a brigade-group formation, possessing only two infantry battalions: 1 and 2 RVR, as well as two field artillery regiments, a medium regiment and a locating battery. As a result, in February the division&#x27;s headquarters were merged with the 4th Task Force&#x27;s headquarters as the 3rd Division was redesignated as the &quot;3rd Division Field Force Group&quot;. At the same time, the position of formation commander was downgraded to the rank of brigadier rather than major general. This remained the case until April 1984 when the divisional headquarters was re-established.

In the late 1980s the division was given the task of vital asset protection under the Defence of Australia doctrine and the division undertook a number of exercises in the north of Australia, including &quot;Kangaroo 89&quot; in which more than 3,000 of its personnel took part. Nevertheless, in June 1991, following a force structure review, the 3rd Division was finally removed from the Australian Army&#x27;s order of battle, and its remaining units were transferred to the command of the 4th Brigade.

<text>Sir Richard Armstrong (born 7 January 1943, in Leicester, England) is an English conductor. He was educated at Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys and Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he was an organ scholar.

==Overview==
From 1973 until 1986 Armstrong was musical director of the Welsh National Opera. In this period he worked in collaboration with many leading European directors, including Peter Stein, Joachim Herz, Lucian Pintilie, and Harry Kupfer, conducting a wide repertoire of Verdi, Wagner, Janáček, Strauss, Berg and Britten and, in 1986, performances of the complete Ring Cycle. He has returned regularly to WNO as a guest conductor, notably for the world première of Peter Maxwell Davies’s &quot;The Doctor of Myddfai&quot;, and for Peter Stein’s 1988 production of &quot;Falstaff&quot;, which he also conducted in New York, Milan, Paris and Tokyo.

He was Music Director of Scottish Opera from 1993 to 2005. During this time he conducted operas including &quot;Jenůfa&quot;, &quot;From the House of the Dead&quot;, &quot;I due Foscari&quot;, &quot;Salome&quot;, &quot;Fidelio&quot;, &quot;Mary Stuart&quot;, &quot;Káťa Kabanová&quot;, &quot;Peter Grimes&quot;, &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, &quot;La forza del destino&quot;, &quot;The Jacobin&quot;, &quot;La traviata&quot;, &quot;Il trovatore&quot;, the world première of James MacMillan&#x27;s &quot;Inês de Castro&quot; (a revival of which was broadcast by BBC television), &quot;The Cunning Little Vixen&quot;, &quot;Turandot&quot;, &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot;, &quot;La bohème&quot;, &quot;The Queen of Spades&quot;, &quot;Dalibor&quot;, &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot;, &quot;Parsifal&quot;, &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, &quot;Erwartung&quot;, &quot;Bluebeard&#x27;s Castle&quot; and &quot;The Knot Garden&quot;. He conducted five complete performances of Scottish Opera’s acclaimed production of the Ring Cycle, which opened at the 2003 Edinburgh International Festival and was subsequently seen at the Theatre Royal Glasgow, and The Lowry, Salford. He led Scottish Opera on a number of visits abroad: to Lisbon in 1994, to the 2000 Vienna Festival, where the Company performed its highly praised production of &quot;Macbeth&quot;, and to Porto in 2001, where he conducted the European première of MacMillan’s &quot;Inês de Castro&quot;.

After Cambridge, Richard Armstrong joined the music staff of the Royal Opera, Covent Garden, where he worked with Georg Solti on the Ring, with Carlo Maria Giulini on &quot;La traviata&quot;, with Otto Klemperer on &quot;Fidelio&quot; and with Rafael Kubelík on &quot;Jenůfa&quot;.

In the UK he has conducted &quot;Billy Budd&quot;, &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot;, &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot; and &quot;Don Carlos&quot; for Royal Opera, Covent Garden, and &quot;Aida&quot;, &quot;Wozzeck&quot;, &quot;The Makropoulos Affair&quot;, and (in a co-production with Scottish Opera) the UK premières of Schnittke’s &quot;Life with an Idiot&quot; for English National Opera. His opera work abroad includes engagements in Frankfurt (where he was, for two seasons, Principal Guest Conductor), Geneva, Paris, Munich, Amsterdam, Rome, Lisbon, Brussels, Nice, Canada, Australia, Stuttgart, Berlin, Toulouse and Los Angeles.

In 1978 he won the Janáček Medal in recognition of the pioneering Janáček cycle produced in collaboration with David Pountney for Welsh National Opera and Scottish Opera. In 2004 he conducted &quot;Káťa Kabanová&quot; for the Janáček Festival in the composer’s native Brno to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the composer&#x27;s birth.

Richard Armstrong made his BBC Proms début in 1979, and has worked with many leading British orchestras, including the London Philharmonic, Philharmonia, BBC Symphony Orchestra, BBC National Orchestra of Wales, Hallé, Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Scottish Chamber Orchestra, the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, and the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra.

He has recorded CDs with Roberto Alagna, Angela Gheorghiu, Deborah Voigt and Thomas Hampson with the LPO, Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment.

==Honours and awards==
In 1993 Richard Armstrong was made Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for Services to Music, and was also knighted in the 2004 New Year’s honours. In 1997, he was awarded the United Kingdom Conductor of the Year by the Royal Philharmonic Music Society. He is an Honorary Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, an Honorary Member of the Royal Academy of Music, and holds honorary doctorates in Music from Glasgow, Aberdeen and St Andrews universities.

<text>The Almaz () program was a highly secret Soviet military space station program, begun in the early 1960s.

Three crewed military reconnaissance stations were launched between 1973 and 1976: Salyut 2, Salyut 3 and Salyut 5. 
To cover the military nature of the program, the three launched Almaz stations were designated as civilian Salyut space stations.
Salyut 2 failed shortly after achieving orbit, but Salyut 3 and Salyut 5 both conducted successful crewed testing. 
Following Salyut 5, the Soviet Ministry of Defense judged in 1978 that the time and resources consumed by station maintenance outweighed the benefits relative to automatic reconnaissance satellites. Still, it had some achievements along with Salyut program, the heritage of the twin program continues, with the ISS module Zarya being one example.

The space stations&#x27; cores were known internally as OPS (, GRAU index 11F71 and 11F71B), from &quot;Orbital Piloted Station&quot; (). As part of the Almaz program, the Soviets developed several spacecraft for support roles—the VA spacecraft, the Functional Cargo Block and the TKS spacecraft—which they planned to use in several combinations.

==Development==
Vladimir Chelomei at the OKB-52 design bureau promoted Almaz as a response to the US Air Force&#x27;s Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) project. MOL had been widely publicized in the US press in the early 1960s, which provided Chelomei plenty of material to use to lobby for a Soviet response.

The Almaz space station programme involved three major hardware components:
* Orbital Piloted Station (OPS, 11F71) module, forming the space station itself,
* Functional Cargo Block (FGB, 11F77), intended as resupply craft for the stations, and
* VA spacecraft (11F74, known in the West as the &quot;Merkur&quot; spacecraft), intended as launch and return vehicle for the crews, and reusable for up to 10 flights.

The OPS would have a maximum diameter of , a mass of roughly , and an internal habitable volume of .

Much like its MOL/Gemini counterpart, the initial Almaz APOS space station design called for the launch of an Almaz-OPS space station and a VA return capsule containing its initial three man crew, mated together as OPS/VA atop Chelomei&#x27;s UR-500 Proton rocket. As with MOL/Gemini, once in orbit the crew would access the lab through a hatch in the heat shield at the bottom of the VA capsule.
After an extended stay of 30 to 60 days of military observation and photography the crew would return to Earth by way of a VA return vehicle.

Unlike the American MOL design, the Soviets designed the Almaz to be recrewed and resupplied. For this, they created the TKS resupply craft (11F72), which consisted of an FGB and a VA return craft to carry the crew, also launched together on a Proton rocket. At the station, one docking port would be available to receive the TKS craft once the previous crew had left the station in their VA capsule.

While the MOL was cancelled in 1969, the Almaz program was integrated into the Salyut programme and resulted in three flown space stations, two of which were crewed successfully. As &quot;man-rating&quot; the VA spacecraft and the Proton rocket took longer, the first phase called for the launch of three Almaz stations without the VA spacecraft, with the crew instead launched separately by Soyuz rocket in a modified Soyuz spacecraft. Plans called for the first three Almaz stations to be visited by three two-month-long expeditions each. This was realized fully by two missions and partially by one; however, the initial intention of launching Almaz APOS and the TKS spacecraft together with its crew in VA spacecraft would never materialize during the program, and neither would the TKS craft play its intended role as resupply craft. The Almaz APOS design, without VA spacecraft, would evolve into the Almaz OPS station cores of the Salyut programme.

===Defense measures===
In addition to reconnaissance equipment, Almaz was equipped with a unique 23mm Rikhter (factory index 261P or 225P) rapid-fire cannon mounted on the forward belly of the station. This revolver cannon was modified from the tail-gun of the Tu-22 bomber and was capable of a theoretical rate of fire of 1800-2000 (up to 2600) rounds per minute. Each 168 gram (ammo 23-OFZ-D-R ) or 173 gram (ammo 23-OFZ-G-R) projectile flew at a speed of 850 m/s relative to the station. The cannon was tested at the end of the mission by firing 20 rounds, when the station was operating in uncrewed mode. To aim the cannon, which was on a fixed mounting, the entire station would be turned to face the target. The Almaz series are the only known armed, crewed military spacecraft ever flown.

Salyut 3/OPS-2 conducted a successful remote test firing with the station uncrewed due to concerns over excessive vibration and noise.

OPS-4 was to have featured two rockets instead of the aircraft cannon, but this system has not been shown publicly and may have never been fully manufactured despite it being used experimentally.

==Orbital Piloted Stations (OPS)==
Three Almaz OPS space stations were flown from 1973 to 1976 in the Salyut programme: Salyut 2 (OPS-1), Salyut 3 (OPS-2) and Salyut 5 (OPS-3).

Five crewed Soyuz expeditions were flown to the Almaz space stations Salyut 3 and Salyut 5, with three reaching their stations and only two of the missions being considered fully successful at that time – the three crews that had reached their stations had crewed Almaz stations for a total of 81 days when the program was ended.

Besides the three flown space stations OPS-1 to OPS-3, seven more spaceframes of Almaz space stations had been built when the program was cancelled: OPS-4, Almaz-205, Almaz-206, Almaz-T, Almaz-T2 (Kosmos 1870), Almaz-1 and Almaz-2 – with Almaz-T2 and Almaz-1 having successfully flown as repurposed uncrewed radar-carrying reconnaissance satellites (see below). The partially outfitted hulls of Almaz-205 and Almaz-206 are today in the property of Excalibur Almaz, a company that plans to launch these as crewed space stations (see below).

===Flown Almaz space stations===

====OPS-1 (Salyut 2)====

The first Almaz station (OPS-1 or Almaz 101.1) was launched on April 3, 1973. For purposes of military secrecy, it was publicly designated Salyut 2 upon reaching orbit. A crew was prepared to fly to the station but an accident days after the launch left OPS-1 disabled and depressurized.

====OPS-2 (Salyut 3)====

OPS-2 (or Almaz 101.2), announced as Salyut 3, was launched on June 25, 1974. The crew of the Soyuz 14 spacecraft spent 15 days aboard the station in July 1974. A second expedition was launched toward OPS-2 in August 1974, but failed to reach the station. The station successfully remotely test-fired an onboard aircraft cannon at a target satellite while the station was uncrewed. Salyut-3 was deorbited in January 1975.

====OPS-3 (Salyut 5)====

OPS-3 (or Almaz 103), announced after launch as Salyut 5, entered orbit on June 22, 1976. It was visited by two crews in mid-1976 and late 1977. Salyut 5 was deorbited on 8 August 1977, and broke up as it reentered the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

===Unflown Almaz space stations===

====OPS-4====
The next Almaz station, OPS-4, was to be the first station launched with a three panel Mech-A synthetic-aperture radar and a crewed reusable Return Vehicle VA, however the VA was replaced by a second TKS docking port. This station&#x27;s Shchit-1 23 mm defense cannon was also to be replaced with an advanced Shchit-2 space-to-space cannon. The Shchit-2 was reported to be a two projectile system, although no photographs of it have ever been published and it does not appear that this system was ever installed on the station. OPS-4 was grounded when the Almaz crewed program was cancelled.

==Almaz-T (uncrewed)==

Following cancellation of the program, the Almaz station was reconfigured as an uncrewed heavy radar-carrying reconnaissance satellite. Three such satellites were launched, two of which functioned successfully in orbit.

===Almaz-T===
Almaz-T – The first Almaz-T blasted off from Baikonur on October 29, 1986. It did not reach orbit due to the failure of the first and second stages of the Proton launcher to separate. The safety system then destroyed the vehicle.

===Almaz-T2 (Kosmos 1870)===
Kosmos 1870 – On July 25, 1987, Almaz-T2, the second Almaz-T spacecraft, successfully reached orbit with an inclination 71.92 degrees toward the Equator and it was officially identified as Kosmos-1870. The spacecraft functioned for two years, providing radar imagery with a resolution down to 25 meters, until it was deorbited on July 30, 1989.

It was the first commercial radar satellite, according to Art Dula (chairman of Excalibur Almaz), who worked in a company marketing the radar images gathered by the satellite.

===Almaz-1===
Almaz-1 – The third Almaz-T spacecraft was launched on March 31, 1991, under the name Almaz-1. After the launch a failure of the communications antenna designed to downlink the imagery via the Luch relay satellite was noted. Also one of the solar panels failed to deploy completely, leaving the main radar panel of the spacecraft partially blocked. After 18 months of successful work the Almaz-1 was deorbited on October 17, 1992, over the Pacific Ocean.
===Almaz-2===
Almaz-2 (Almaz-1V) – Not flown. It had a new radar that would have provided a resolution of 5 to 7 meters. In addition, an optical-electronic payload on the station would have been capable of producing imagery with a resolution of 2.5 – 4 meters.

==Heritage==
The heritage of the Almaz space station program continues until today, and can even be found today in the International Space Station and in the Tianhe core module of the Tiangong space station.

===DOS space station cores===

The DOS (Durable Orbital Station) space station core modules were based on the Almaz-OPS hull design, which was mated by Sergei Korolev&#x27;s organization OKB-1 with their own Soyuz-derived subsystems. OKB-1 was at that time in competition with the designer of the Almaz, Vladimir Chelomei&#x27;s organization OKB-52, and was thereby able to short-cut the development time for the first space station and beat OKB-52, which had started design work much earlier.

DOS space station cores derived since 1971 from the Almaz-OPS hull design include:
* DOS-1, which formed the basis for Salyut 1 space station, in 1971 the first space station in the history of space flight
* DOS-5 and DOS-6, the cores for the long lived Salyut 6 and Salyut 7 space stations
* DOS-7, the Mir Core Module for the Mir space station, the first modular space station
* DOS-8, the Zvezda &quot;Service Module&quot; for the International Space Station, still in use

===Functional Cargo Block (FGB)===

The FGB was a standalone spacecraft which was intended to function as a resupply craft for the Almaz space stations. The &#x27;functional&#x27; section of the name is representative of the fact that the FGB provided electrical power, propulsion, guidance, and docking. Cargo was presented as a large cargo bay accessible by the crew, as well as external fuel tanks. Other types of FGB existed, as it was a broad classification rather than a specific type of module. FGB-based vehicles include Transport Logistics Spacecraft (Russian Acronym: TKS) (1976-1983), Space Station modules (1985-present), and space tugs (1987-present)

The modules based on the DOS design are not the only heritage of the Almaz program still in use: The habitat, propulsion and service module of the TKS spacecraft, the so-called Functional Cargo Block (FGB), went on to become the core of many Soviet and Russian space station modules. The FGB-based Kvant-1 module of the Mir space station was the first space station module of its kind, and the Zarya Functional Cargo Block, which is still in use on the International Space Station.

===Excalibur Almaz===

The private spaceflight company Excalibur Almaz bought the two partially completed Almaz-205 and Almaz-206 space station hulls from the Russian NPO Mashinostroyeniya (the former OKB-52) with the stated intention to outfit and launch them.
The Almaz-205 module is similar to the OPS-2 of the Salyut 3 station, while the Almaz-206 is closer to the OPS-3 of the Salyut 5 station.

In addition, Excalibur Almaz acquired four VA return capsule hulls (derived from the TKS/VA spacecraft) and plans to outfit and launch them as well: one is planned to be used in support of space tourism while the other three capsules are reserved for scientific and commercial payloads. The needed development of propulsion systems for the VA capsule was reportedly delegated to an unnamed European organization as early as 2009.

Excalibur Almaz postponed its first launch to 2015 to be able to include more lucrative deep space capabilities like asteroid mining. However, in 2015 the company was reported to be in problems, and it was not clear what happened to their spacecraft.

<doc id="416509" wikidata="Q4639255" url="?curid=416509" title="4th Division (Australia)">
<text>The Australian 4th Division was formed in the First World War during the expansion of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) infantry brigades in February 1916. In addition to the experienced 4th Brigade (previously in the original New Zealand and Australian Division) were added the new 12th and 13th Brigades (spawned from the battalions of the 4th and 3rd Brigades respectively). From Egypt the division was sent to France, where it took part in the fighting on the Western Front during 1916–1918. After the war ended, the AIF was demobilised and the division was dissolved.

In 1921, the 4th Division was reactivated as a Citizen Military Forces (militia/reserve) formation. The division performed home defence duties for most of World War II. The division&#x27;s composition during World War II changed frequently, as brigades were rotated between different divisions and moved to different locations as the need arose. The division spent the majority of the war in Western Australia, before moving to Queensland prior to its deactivation in late 1944.

==World War I==

===Formation in Egypt, 1916===
In January 1916, in the aftermath of the Gallipoli Campaign, the Australian government decided to expand the Australian Imperial Force, then based in Egypt, prior to the force&#x27;s deployment to the Western Front. At the time, two divisions already existed in Egypt: the 1st and 2nd. The 3rd Division was also being raised in Australia. The 2nd Division had only been partially raised by the time it was sent to Gallipoli late in the campaign, so it was left to complete its formation, while the 1st Division, and the spare 4th Brigade (which had formed part of the composite New Zealand and Australian Division and had served at Gallipoli) were used to provide an experienced cadre to form the 4th and 5th Divisions. The 4th Division subsequently gained the experienced 4th Brigade, and two newly raised brigades – the 12th and 13th – which were formed from cadres from the 4th and 3rd Brigades respectively.

Under the command of Major General Vaughan Cox, a British Indian Army officer, the 4th Division began forming at Tel el Kebir, in Egypt in February 1916. In addition to three infantry brigades, the new division included various support troops, including the 4th Field Company, 4th Field Ambulance and 7th Army Service Corps Company, which had previously served at Gallipoli. Together with the 5th Division, the 4th Division formed II ANZAC Corps under Lieutenant General Alexander Godley.

There were delays in assembling the divisional artillery as I ANZAC Corps, which was to proceed to France first, received priority for personnel and artillery pieces. Consequently, the division could not depart for France before June 1916. In the meantime, the 4th Division undertook defensive duties along the Suez Canal, around Serapeum, to defend against a possible Ottoman attack. As it was necessary for elements of the division to take over as soon as possible, the 16th Battalion was sent ahead by train, while the rest of the division completed the move on foot, marching through the desert from Tel el Kebir to take up their positions, arriving in late March. At Serapeum, the division absorbed a batch of reinforcements that had been left behind by the departed 1st and 2nd Divisions, consisting of men with poor conduct records, who were deemed to need further training prior to employment in combat.

===Somme, 1916===
Personnel deficiencies amongst the division&#x27;s artillery units were hastily rectified by bolstering numbers from the division&#x27;s infantry units, as well as light horse reinforcements. Throughout May, these units received rudimentary training and by the end of the month, the 4th Division received its orders to deploy to the Western Front. The following month, the division moved to France, taking over part of the &quot;nursery&quot; sector near Armentières, where they could be introduced to trench warfare in a relatively quite area. The 4th Brigade was first into the line, taking over a sector from the 2nd Division on 15 June.

The division was transferred to I ANZAC Corps around this time, swapping with the New Zealand Division. The division&#x27;s stay at Armentières was brief and it soon accompanied the 1st and 2nd Divisions to the Somme sector where the British had launched an offensive in July. In August 1916, it relieved the 2nd Division on the Pozières heights, arriving in time to fight off a determined German counterattack. The attack fell largely on a small number of battalions, with the South Australian 48th Battalion losing nearly 600 men killed or wounded; the New South Welshman of the 45th Battalion were called upon to help a neighbouring British unit capture a position dubbed &quot;Munster Alley&quot;, during which they lost 345 men. Meanwhile, an attack on the 14th Battalion was repulsed after an individual effort by Lieutenant Albert Jacka, who had previously received the Victoria Cross for actions at Gallipoli.

Following this, the division was brought back up to two thirds strength, and after relieving the 2nd Division, launched an attack to the north of Mouquet Farm. After a rest, the division returned to Mouquet Farm in late August and early September; the division&#x27;s losses during these two periods amounted to over 7,000 killed or wounded. After a rest around Ypres, the division undertook a third tour of the front at Flers in the final months of 1916. In December 1916, Major General William Holmes assumed command of the division, arriving in January 1917.

===Hindenburg Line, 1917===

The 4th Division remained on the Somme during the winter of 1916–1917, enduring extreme cold and damp conditions. In the early part of 1917, after winter had passed, the division took part in operations on the Ancre, before the Germans sought to reduce the length of their line, withdrawing to prepared positions along the Hindenburg Line. In response, the Allied units began a brief pursuit, the Australian contribution to which involved columns from the 2nd and 5th Divisions being sent forward in pursuit. A period of rapid movement followed until the outposts were reached, and resistance grew. In April, the Fifth Army, to which the 4th Division was assigned, was ordered to attack the Hindenburg Line south of Arras. As part of this, on 11 April, two of the division&#x27;s brigades – the 4th and 12th – assaulted the new line in the First Battle of Bullecourt, supported by British tanks for the first time. Due to break downs and other mishaps, the tanks were largely ineffective; nevertheless, the initial assault proved successful in capturing the first trench line, and also partially capturing the second. Lacking artillery support, which had been held back due to incorrect reports about the location of Allied troops, and enfiladed from the flanks, the Australians became cut off and came under heavy counter-attack from the 27th Division. Ultimately the battle was a disaster for the 4th Division, with 3,200 casualties, and 1,170 captured.

Following the failed attack around Bullecourt, the division was withdrawn from the line for rest and reinforcement. The next major attack it took part in came in June, when it participated in the Battle of Messines, in Flanders, Belgium. Fought as part of efforts to secure the Wytschaete – Messines Ridge, which existed south of a salient in the line around Ypres, providing the Germans with observation of the Allied positions, the battle saw the 4th Division brought in to reinforce the British 25th Division, the Australian 3rd and the New Zealand Division. Although slated to be the corps reserve, during the attack, launched on 7 June, the division was called upon to secure a large gap that developed in the line after the neighbouring British corps was held up. In this effort, the division was tasked with attacking the Oosttaverne Line late in the day. Enduring shelling by their own guns, and coming up against German pillboxes for the first time, the division took heavy casualties, but managed to secure all but a small part of the line where the Australian sector joined the neighbouring British sector.

Following the Battle of Messines, the division remained in the line around the town. On 2 July, the divisional commander, Holmes, was fatally wounded by a stray shell while escorting the New South Wales premier, William Holman, around the battlefield at Messines. Holmes was replaced temporarily by Brigadier General Charles Rosenthal until a new permanent commander could arrive, in the form of Major General Ewen Sinclair-Maclagan, who took over the division on 16 July 1917.

In September, the Australians took part in the Third Battle of Ypres. Within this wider battle, the Australian divisions took part in several subsidiary actions. The 1st and 2nd Divisions undertook the first attack around the Menin Road, which was followed up by the 4th and 5th Divisions around Polygon Wood on 26 September. Attacking in the centre of the Allied line, the two divisions were flanked by the British V Corps to the north, and X Corps to the south. The 4th Division was the more northern of the two Australian divisions for the assault, and tasked with capturing the northern part of Polygon Wood, and the high ground beyond it, and tying-in with the British around the edge of Zonnebeke while the 5th Division captured the remainder of the wood. Supported by a well co-ordinated artillery barrage, which rolled ahead of the assault, and then broke up the subsequent German counter-attack, the attack proved successful, albeit costly. The 4th Division&#x27;s attack was carried by the 4th and 13th Brigades, with the 12th in reserve, and resulted in 1,700 casualties amongst the division.

On 12 October, the 12th Brigade was assigned to protect the 3rd Division&#x27;s flank during the First Battle of Passchendaele, and took part in an effort to capture the Keiberg ridge. Although, elements of the 3rd were able to enter Passchendaele, and the 12th gained their objective, both groups were eventually forced back. The unsuccessful effort cost the 12th Brigade around 1,000 casualties. The Canadians then took over responsibility for the sector, and were eventually able to secure the village in November, while the Australians were withdrawn to Messines for a rest. In the wake of considerable losses, which could not be made up from voluntary recruitment, Australian authorities considered breaking up the 4th Division to provide reinforcements, although this did not eventuate. In November 1917, the division became part of the Australian Corps, initially under Lieutenant General William Birdwood and then later under Lieutenant General John Monash.

===German Spring Offensive, 1918===

Throughout the winter of 1917–1918, the Australians rotated between the front and rest areas around Flanders and northern France, during which time it was largely quiet, apart from occasional shelling and aerial attacks. In early 1917, the Australians moved back to the front around Messines, after a rest in the rear areas. The 4th Division spent a short period in the line around Hollebeke in the northern part of the Australian sector during this time. In late March, the division was rushed to the Somme region to stem the German spring offensive, which had been launched on 21 March and was threatening Amiens. The Australian 3rd and 4th Divisions had been ordered to proceed to Amiens to strengthen the retreating British 5th Army. There it repulsed the advancing Germans in several hard-fought battles at Hebuterne and Dernancourt.

The 4th Brigade was detached from the division during this time, and fought a sharp action alongside the New Zealanders at Hebuterne, holding off several German attacks in late March and early April. Meanwhile, the 12th and 13th Brigades established themselves south of Albert, around the railway embankment and cuttings of the Albert–Amiens railway at Dernancourt, where they joined troops of the British VII Corps. The 12th Brigade was positioned forward, taking over from the British 9th (Scottish) Division, while the 13th held a support position around Bresle and Ribemont-sur-Ancre. On 28 March, during the First Battle of Dernancourt, the 12th brigade helped fight off an attack by the 50th Reserve Division, with 137 Australian casualties. A week later, on 5 April, the Second Battle of Dernancourt was fought. In the lead up, the 13th Brigade moved forward beside the 12th, taking over from the 35th Division. Together, the two brigades faced an attack by two and a half German divisions in what was described by historian Chris Coulthard-Clark as &quot;the strongest attack mounted against the Australians in the war&quot;. The Australian 48th Battalion soon found itself outflanked by Germans to its rear. The 48th was ordered to hold at all costs but by midday was facing annihilation and the senior officer ordered a withdrawal, which was completed in good order. The two brigades then committed their reserves, which restored the situation for the Allies. In the action, the division lost 1,230 casualties, and afterwards it was relieved by the 2nd Division.

In April, the 13th Brigade was involved in the counterattack at Villers-Bretonneux. On 21 April, in the lead up to the battle, the German fighter pilot, Manfred von Richthofen (the &quot;Red Baron&quot;) was shot down over Australian lines, north of Villers-Bretonneux at Corbie. There are many theories as to who shot him down, one of which is that an Australian Vickers machine gunner, Sergeant Cedric Popkin of the 24th Machine-Gun Company, 4th Division, fired the actual bullet that killed von Richthofen. At dawn on 24 April, the Germans launched their attack, supported by armoured vehicles and a heavy artillery bombardment, that included mustard gas. With the situation urgent, the British III Corps ordered a counter-attack from the Australian 13th and 15th Brigades to retake the town. The attack was launched around 10 pm that night, with the two brigades isolated the town, enveloping it from the north and south, before entering it on Anzac Day to begin mopping up operations, with the Australians penetrating from the east, while British troops came from the opposite direction. The 14th Brigade, from the 5th Division, also filled a supporting role, securing flanking positions to the north of the town. In early May, the 12th Brigade carried out a follow-up attack around Monument Wood, to the east of Villers-Bretonneux, which made little headway against the defending Jager troops; nevertheless, the recapture of Villers-Bretonneux had restored the Allied line in the sector.

===Hundred Days offensive, 1918===
Following the defeat of the German Spring Offensive, a brief lull followed while the Allies prepared to launch their own offensive, which ultimately would bring an end to the war. During this time, the division went on to fight in the Battle of Hamel in July. The 4th Division was responsible for planning and commanding the attack, but the decision was made the only one of its brigades would take part with the 4th Brigade being reinforced by brigades from both the 3rd and 5th Divisions, as well as four companies from the US 33rd Infantry Division for the attack. A combined arms assault, including armour and air support, the attack proved successful in capturing the town, in just over 90 minutes, for around 1,400 casualties.

After the Allies launched their Hundred Days Offensive in August 1918, the division took part in the Battle of Amiens, the Battle of Albert, the Battle of Épehy and the battles against the Hindenburg Line outposts, finally reaching the town of Bellenglise. Withdrawn in late September, the division was replaced by the 3rd and 5th Divisions for the Battle of St Quentin Canal, and then the 2nd Division for the assault on the Beaureviour Line. For these final battles, the 4th Division provided 200 advisers to assist the inexperienced US troops that were assigned to Monash&#x27;s corps. In early October, the remainder of the Australian Corps was withdrawn from the line for rest at the insistence of Prime Minister Billy Hughes.

After the armistice in November 1918, the division was not selected to advance into Germany. Demobilisation commenced in late 1918, and in March 1919 the division merged with 1st Australian Division, under the designation A Divisional Group, as personnel were repatriated back to Australia and individual units were demobilised. During the war, the division suffered 41,048 casualties, including 8,360 killed in action. Another 2,613 men died of wounds, and 872 died from other causes. A total of 2,076 men were captured, and 27,127 were wounded.

==Inter-war years and World War II==
In 1921, following the demobilisation of the AIF, Australia&#x27;s part-time military forces were reorganised to replicate the numerical designations of the AIF. At this time, the 4th Division name was revived and was assigned to a Citizen Military Forces (reserve) formation headquartered in Melbourne, and assigned to the 3rd Military District. This formation consisted of three brigades spread across two states: the 2nd and 6th were based in Victoria, while the 3rd was based in South Australia. The division&#x27;s commander upon re-establishment was Major General William Glasgow.

After the outbreak of war with Japan, the division was mobilised for war service and undertook defensive duties in southern Victoria, as part of Southern Command. In April 1942, the division became part of III Corps, which was responsible for the defence of Western Australia. The division occupied positions around Guildford, Geraldton, Moora and Perth. Following the arrival of the 2nd Division in July 1942, the division handed over the Perth region to them, although several rotations occurred over the next six months. In October 1942, the division took part in a large-scale anti-invasion exercise around Geraldton, which involved over 20,000 troops. Headquartered around Moora, the 2nd Brigade was positioned outside Geraldton, while the 6th held Irwin and Mingenew, and the 13th Brigade was around Dandaragan and Jurien Bay. Responding to a landing at Dongara, by a simulated Japanese division (played by the 8th Brigade) the exercise lasted four days and was the largest anti-invasion exercise undertaken by the Australian Army during the war.

In January 1943, the division was slowly broken up with the 6th Brigade being sent to Queensland and the 13th deploying to the Northern Territory. In April and May 1943, the division&#x27;s headquarters was transferred to north Queensland, establishing itself around Townsville, absorbing personnel from the disbanded Yorkforce headquarters. At this time, the division assumed control of a broad area, with many dispersed brigades: the 6th at Kuranda, the 11th at Cairns, the 12th at Smyth&#x27;s Siding, and the 14th at Cluden.

Over time all of these brigades were transferred elsewhere (Milne Bay, Darwin, and Merauke), meanwhile the division gained the 3rd Brigade. As the war advanced north, the need for strong garrison forces on the mainland of Australia diminished. As more garrison troops were moved to the Torres Strait, the 4th Division&#x27;s headquarters was moved to Thursday Island in October 1943, and then to Cape York. At this time, the division assumed control of Torres Strait Force and Merauke Force, although both forces were reduced or redesignated shortly after, with Merauke Force being redesignated as the 11th Brigade and later being withdrawn back to Brisbane, and Torres Strait Force being reduced to an area command. By February 1944, the division reported directly to the First Army. As further Allied advances in New Guinea reduced the threat posed to the area the 4th Division became redundant and its headquarters elements were withdrawn to Atherton and disbanded in October 1944.

<doc id="416512" wikidata="Q4657339" url="?curid=416512" title="A History of Vodka">
<text>A History of Vodka (, Romanized: ) is an academic monograph by William Pokhlyobkin, which was awarded the Langhe Ceretto Prize. Although the work had been finished in 1979, it was published just before the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In his book, in particular, Pokhlyobkin wanted the Russian vodka to be legally produced only from the rye stuff.

==The book==
After years of painstaking research Pokhlyobkin concluded that Russia&#x27;s first grain-based vodka could have been distilled at the premises of the Chudov Monastery in the Moscow Kremlin by a monk called Isidore circa 1430. Apparently, the distillation technology spread to the city of Moscow itself in 1440s. Pokhlyobkin suggests that both prohibition and drunkenness are scourges which encourage one another. He suggests that irresponsible and uncultured ways of consuming vodka make people drunk, not vodka itself.

The later Russian editions include the 2005 softcover issue by Tsentrpoligraf ().

===Criticism===
Three years after the publication the book was criticized by David Christian in &quot;Slavic Review&quot;. He cast doubt on statistics presented in the book. In Christian&#x27;s opinion, the definitions of such terms as distilling and state monopoly were found so vague that it became hard to know when Pokhlyobkin offered firm dates for their first appearance. The arguments about the first usage of the word &quot;vodka&quot; and its first appearance were marked as convoluted, messy, repetitive as well as sometimes self-contradictory and unconvincing. Christian also pointed out at anti-capitalist polemics and Stalinist snobberies of the book.

Another case, tackled by criticism, is the way &quot;On the Combinations of Water with Alcohol&quot; by Dmitriy Mendeleyev was emphasized. It was pointed out that Pokhlyobkin used Mendeleyev&#x27;s data in a speculative way to ascribe to solution of spirit and water the eminent &quot;biochemical and physiological properties&quot;.

<doc id="416514" wikidata="Q2298077" url="?curid=416514" title="Karen Page">
<text>Karen Page is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics created by Stan Lee and Bill Everett. She serves as the original love interest for Daredevil with first appearance occurring in 1964, under Matt Murdock&#x27;s and Foggy Nelson employ as their office manager. Karen is killed by Bullseye in 1999.

Karen Page was portrayed by Ellen Pompeo in the 2003 feature film &quot;Daredevil&quot;, and by Deborah Ann Woll in the Marvel Television streaming television productions &quot;Daredevil&quot;, &quot;The Defenders&quot;, and &quot;The Punisher&quot;, set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). She will return in Marvel Studios Disney+ series &quot;&quot;.

==Publication history==
Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Bill Everett, she first appeared in &quot;Daredevil&quot; #1 (April 1964).

==Character overview==
In her first appearances, Karen is the beautiful secretary for the law firm of Daredevil&#x27;s alter ego Matt Murdock, and the mutual love interest of both Murdock and his partner Foggy Nelson. Her relationship with Murdock hits a downward spiral when he reveals his secret identity to her in &quot;Daredevil&quot; #57 (October 1969), setting off a long break-up which concluded with her departure from the series in issue #86 (April 1972). Within these final stories, she trades her profession of secretary to become a film actress.

After three years&#x27; absence from published stories, Karen returned for a considerable stint as a supporting character in &quot;Ghost Rider&quot;, starting with vol. 2 #13 (August 1975) and continuing through to #26 (October 1977). During this time, a crossover with &quot;Daredevil&quot; #138 afforded her a brief return appearance in the series where she got her start. A 1978 appearance in &quot;Marvel Two-in-One&quot; would prove the character&#x27;s last showing for over seven years.

Karen returned in &quot;Born Again&quot;, the award-winning storyline beginning in &quot;Daredevil&quot; #227 (February 1986) that would ultimately restore her earlier role as Daredevil&#x27;s love interest. Writer Ann Nocenti gave considerably more development to their relationship, and even had Karen acting as a sidekick to Daredevil for the first time in issue #259, in which she goes undercover to help take down a child pornography ring. She was again dropped from the series in issue #263 (February 1989) for another long-term breakup from Murdock, but this time was brought back just two years later, for &quot;Daredevil&quot; #294 (July 1991).

Karen is killed by Daredevil&#x27;s adversary Bullseye in &quot;Daredevil&quot; vol. 2 #5, (March 10, 1999).

==Fictional character biography==
Karen Page is first seen being hired by Matt Murdock&#x27;s partner, Foggy Nelson, as a secretary for the new law firm &quot;Nelson and Murdock&quot;. She is infatuated with Matt Murdock from the moment they meet. When Matt introduces her to the adventuring, wisecracking aspect of his personality, in the guise of his &quot;twin brother&quot; Mike, she finds herself equally charmed by this side of Murdock.

Dr. Paxton Page (Karen&#x27;s father) fakes his own kidnapping and death in order to assume the guise of the villain Death&#x27;s-Head. Karen returns to her parents&#x27; home in Fagan Corners, Vermont, to investigate her father&#x27;s disappearance. Daredevil follows her. In the ensuing battle between Daredevil and Death&#x27;s Head, Death&#x27;s Head spills a vat of molten cobalt over Daredevil but realizes that Karen is endangered. This brings Paxton back to his own senses, pushing Daredevil and Karen to safety. He appears to die in this act of self-sacrifice when he is coated in the molten cobalt. After the battle with Death&#x27;s Head, Daredevil&#x27;s true identity is revealed to Karen. She constantly fears for Matt&#x27;s safety, but Daredevil cannot give up fighting crime. Karen eventually leaves Matt and moves to California to pursue her dream of an acting career. She quickly finds work as an actress in a daytime soap opera.

Karen appears alongside Johnny Blaze in a film. After a scene is interrupted by The Uncanny Orb, Katy Milner (Karen&#x27;s stuntwoman) confides in Johnny about Karen&#x27;s history of &quot;unhappy romances&quot; including the ones with Murdock and Phil Hickock. Later on, Karen herself falls under the Orb&#x27;s control. Karen is later offered a role on &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; TV show which was on its first season at the time. She is kidnapped by three ex-stuntmen on the show but is saved by the Thing (who is looking for his own TV show), and the Hulk (who is annoyed at having this show).

Developing an addiction to heroin, Karen&#x27;s career falters and she is soon reduced to starring in cheap pornographic movies. In need of a fix, she sells Daredevil&#x27;s secret identity to a drug dealer who in turn sells this to the Kingpin. Karen is forced to return to New York, where she meets up again with Matt. Having rebuilt his life after surviving the Kingpin&#x27;s machinations, Matt helps Karen beat her addiction, and they resume their relationship and begin sharing an apartment.

Realizing that Matt is incomplete without work as a lawyer (having been disbarred), Karen founds a legal clinic, where she counsels drug addicts while Matt provides legal advice as a &quot;ghost lawyer&quot;. The clinic is destroyed during a demonic invasion of Manhattan, and Karen discovers hours later that Matt has been having an affair with Typhoid Mary. These combined blows leave her psychologically lost, and she runs away.

She becomes an anti-pornography activist, assists Daredevil and the Black Widow in fighting crime on separate occasions and reluctantly starts dating Matt again. At this point, she becomes a radio show host under the name &quot;Paige Angel&quot;. She eventually realizes that she is too dependent on Matt and that her past is a constant barrier between them. Karen leaves Matt to accept a talk show host position in Los Angeles.

While in California, Karen has a routine blood test as part of an insurance policy application. The supervillain Mysterio, as part of a plan to psychologically destroy Daredevil for one last scheme, disguises himself as a doctor, performs the blood test, and tells her that she is HIV positive. Devastated, Karen returns to New York and tells Matt about the diagnosis. Using another disguise, Mysterio suggests to Karen that her infection is due to an infant that Matt is currently protecting, as the child is &#x27;really&#x27; the Antichrist, but Matt forces her to acknowledge that she is just trying to avoid accepting responsibility for her state. Later, during a fight between Daredevil and Bullseye, Karen is fatally impaled by Daredevil&#x27;s billy-club when Bullseye uses it against him and she takes the blow to save his life.

Devastated by Karen&#x27;s death, Matt briefly contemplates suicide but is given new strength to keep going by remembering some of their times together, such as when she convinced Matt to take a night off on his birthday and when she said that she didn&#x27;t want Daredevil to quit as she always felt safer knowing the vigilante was out there. After Mysterio&#x27;s role in the scheme is revealed, Matt attempts and fails to give Karen&#x27;s eulogy, finding himself overwhelmed at the memory of her loss. Initially bitter at Karen dying simply so that Mysterio could feel better about himself, a later conversation with Spider-Man helps Daredevil realize that the infant he&#x27;s saved represents something positive that has come of the whole affair. The baby is placed for adoption to a couple in New Jersey. Before leaving, Matt names the baby after Karen and hopes that her new parents will allow the occasional visit from her &quot;Uncle Matt&quot;.

==Other versions==
===&quot;What If Karen Page Had Lived?&quot;===
In the &quot;What If&quot; comic &quot;What If Karen Page Had Lived?&quot;, Karen is narrowly saved from death when Bullseye hits her in the shoulder rather than the head. However, driven by his rage at the fear of losing her rather than his focused grief when he actually lost her, Matt beats the Kingpin to death for his part in Mysterio&#x27;s scheme, and is subsequently arrested. When Matt is sentenced to 44 years in the Raft for the crime, Karen leaves town and disappears. Matt assumes that she had become severely depressed and may have killed herself. He never sees her again. However, in the beginning of the comic book, it is revealed that the entire story is the speculation of the main Marvel Universe version of Brian Michael Bendis, the writer himself, who makes a cameo as narrator.

===&quot;Secret Wars: Secret Lovers&quot;===
In a one-off book of the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline called &quot;Secret Wars: Secret Lovers&quot;, a universe that became the Battleworld domain of Limbo is shown where Matt and Karen have grown close to the point of living with each other. Daredevil finds himself in a battle with Typhoid Mary after having nightmares about her prior that Karen is aware of. Karen follows the two only to discover that Mary is actually Mephisto, who wants to spend the final evening before Inferno psychologically and physically torturing Matt. Karen saves Matt by cutting off Mephisto&#x27;s head with Mary&#x27;s sword and the two embrace one last time as the world burns around them.

==In other media==
===Film===
Karen appears in the 2003 feature film &quot;Daredevil&quot;, portrayed by Ellen Pompeo. Most of her scenes were deleted from the final theatrical cut, but they can be seen in the Director&#x27;s Cut. In the film, she is attracted to Matt, as shown when she presents two invitations to a business party and demonstrates disappointment when Foggy promptly takes the second invitation. When Matt is tracking the Kingpin&#x27;s forces, Karen helps Foggy determine the meaning of a key piece of evidence in a case.

===Television===

In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Karen Page is portrayed by Deborah Ann Woll.

====Background====
Born in Fagan Corners, Vermont, Karen works as a waitress at Penny&#x27;s Place, a diner run by her mother Penelope and father Paxton, with her brother Kevin running the kitchen. After Penelope dies from cancer, Karen is left to run the diner with her father and brother. To cope with the stress and the fear that her father will drive the diner into bankruptcy without her around to do bookkeeping, she turns to drugs and hooks up with a dealer named Todd Neiman. One night, after a heated argument over dinner, Kevin stages an intervention by burning down Todd&#x27;s trailer. An enraged Todd attacks him with a tire iron, and Karen is forced to shoot him with the gun in his truck to keep him from killing Kevin. While driving away, Karen gets into an argument with Kevin, during which she drifts off the road and crashes into a guardrail. The car flips over several times before coming to rest on its roof, injuring Karen and killing Kevin. The local sheriff, Bernie Cohen, takes sympathy on the Page family and falsifies the accident report to say that Kevin was alone in the car, so that Karen does not face prison time. Karen leaves town after being disowned by her father, and bounces around before arriving in New York City and landing a job as a secretary at Union Allied Construction, a construction company rebuilding Midtown Manhattan after the Chitauri invasion of New York.

====&quot;Daredevil&quot; season 1====
In the first season of &quot;Daredevil&quot;, Karen discovers evidence that Union Allied&#x27;s pension fund is being used by Wilson Fisk to launder criminal money. In response, Fisk has her framed for fatally stabbing a coworker, Daniel Fisher, in her apartment, and intends to have a lawyer on his payroll approach Karen to extort her into giving up her copy of the pension file. However, Matt and Foggy show up and agree to take Karen on as a client thanks to a tipoff from Brett Mahoney. As a result, Fisk instead tries to have Karen killed. In the first attempt, Fisk&#x27;s right hand man James Wesley approaches Clyde Farnum, a guard who is indebted to him, and coerces him into hanging Karen in her jail cell under the threat of having his daughter killed. Farnum tries to strangle Karen with her bedsheets, but Karen fights back, drawing blood from one of Farnum&#x27;s eyes. Undeterred, Fisk sends another assassin to Karen&#x27;s apartment to attack her when she sneaks out of Matt&#x27;s apartment at night to retrieve the pension file, but Matt saves her and delivers the pension file and assassin to the &quot;New York Bulletin&quot; so that Union Allied&#x27;s criminal dealings are publicly exposed. As a show of gratitude to Matt and Foggy for clearing her name, Karen offers to work for them as Nelson &amp; Murdock&#x27;s secretary.

While Fisk orders the murders of everyone involved in the scheme and the attempts to silence Karen, he settles for buying Karen&#x27;s silence by coercing her into signing a nondisclosure agreement with six months&#x27; salary attached to it. While she reluctantly signs the agreement, she is angered that the people who tried to have her killed have not been brought to justice, so she approaches Ben Urich, the &quot;New York Bulletin&quot; reporter who broke the Union Allied story, and works with him to follow the money trail. She refuses to back down even after Ben makes clear that her prior activities in Vermont will be used against her to discredit her as a source. Eventually, she finds out that Union Allied has ties to Westmeyer Holt, a development company that Fisk is using to strongarm tenants into vacating tenements in Hell&#x27;s Kitchen that he intends to develop into high-rise condominiums. One of these tenants, Elena Cardenas, is a client of Nelson &amp; Murdock&#x27;s. On one occasion, two Westmeyer contractors attack Karen while she is paying a visit to Elena, though she is saved when Foggy turns up and beats the men unconscious with his softball bat. Fisk later has Elena killed in order to lure Matt into an ambush by Nobu Yoshioka, a representative of the Hand that Fisk has had a falling out with.

After Fisk makes himself a public figure at the urging of his girlfriend Vanessa Marianna, Karen begins digging into his life looking for incriminating evidence against him. She finds out that contrary to Fisk&#x27;s public claims that his mother Marlene died in childhood, she is in fact alive and well, and living in a nursing home in upstate New York. Karen and Ben visit Marlene, who tells them about how when Fisk was 12, he beat his abusive father to death with a hammer to protect her. Marlene informs Wesley of this visit, prompting Wesley to abduct Karen as she is returning to her apartment. He takes her to a warehouse, and tries to intimidate her into backing down by threatening to have her friends and loved ones killed, emphasizing his threat by leaving a loaded gun (which he procured from the head of Fisk&#x27;s security detail) on the table. When Wesley admits that he has not informed Fisk about her and Ben visiting Marlene (on account of Vanessa having been hospitalized), Karen realizes that she will be off the hook if Wesley dies. When Wesley&#x27;s phone rings as Fisk tries to call him from the hospital, Karen grabs the gun and shoots him to death. She is deeply traumatized over committing murder, drinking heavily and having nightmares in which Fisk appears in her living room and strangles her to death with his bare hands. She is further wracked with guilt when Fisk personally murders Ben in his apartment after finding out from a mole at the &quot;Bulletin&quot; about Ben and Karen&#x27;s visit to Marlene. Nonetheless, Karen composes herself and helps Matt and Foggy track down the hiding place of Carl Hoffman, one of the corrupt detectives who investigated her for Daniel Fisher&#x27;s murder and who in the interim has been coerced by Fisk into killing his partner Christian Blake, allowing Matt to bring him in and have him give up Fisk.

====&quot;Daredevil&quot; season 2====
One year after the events of season 1, Karen comes into contact with and befriends Frank Castle when the firm takes Frank on as a client as he faces trial for murdering members of various criminal gangs that were responsible for the deaths of his family. She and Matt also briefly date before Matt&#x27;s double-life as Daredevil causes a falter in contributing to Frank&#x27;s trial and Karen finds Elektra Natchios in Matt&#x27;s bed when she tells Matt about it. When Nelson &amp; Murdock falls apart, &quot;New York Bulletin&quot; editor-in-chief Mitchell Ellison hires Karen to work for the paper so she can write an exposé on Frank&#x27;s true story, setting her up in Ben&#x27;s former office. During her investigation, she is almost killed by Colonel Schoonover, only being saved by Frank&#x27;s intervention. In the second-season finale, Karen and several others that Matt has saved as Daredevil are kidnapped by the Hand as bait to lure Matt and Elektra into a trap. Matt is able to track the hostages down and rescue them with further aid from Frank after Karen convinces Turk Barrett to turn on his ankle bracelet to allow the police to find them, but Elektra is killed in the process. As the season ends, Matt meets with Karen in the shuttered Nelson &amp; Murdock offices and reveals to her that he&#x27;s Daredevil.

====&quot;The Defenders&quot;====
By the start of &quot;The Defenders&quot;, Matt and Karen are back on speaking terms, although it is clear Karen is hesitant to resume a relationship due to her own secrets. Later, when Matt believes the Hand are targeting his loved ones, he visits Karen at her office to take her to the 29th precinct. Karen is angered when she finds out he has resumed Daredevil activities, but agrees to hide with Foggy in the 29th precinct until the Hand have been taken down. While there, she bonds with Trish Walker over their complicated relationships with Matt and Jessica Jones. When Matt is presumed killed in the destruction of Midland Circle, Karen refuses to believe Matt has died and holds out hope that he somehow survived the collapse.

====&quot;The Punisher&quot; season 1====
In the first season of &quot;The Punisher&quot;, Karen is a recurring character. Caught up in her grief over losing Matt, she agrees to help Frank when he approaches her for help identifying Micro, the hacker who has been shadowing him and knows about his past activities in Kandahar. When Lewis Wilson (Daniel Webber) goes on a bombing spree, he delivers a manifesto to the &quot;Bulletin&quot; explicitly citing Karen&#x27;s defense of Frank in her coverage. Incensed, Karen talks down to Lewis when she appears on a radio show to debate Senator Stan Ori. This prompts Lewis to try and attack Karen in a hotel, though he is driven off by Frank, who later goads him into killing himself in a meat locker in the hotel&#x27;s kitchen.

====&quot;Daredevil&quot; season 3====
Several months after the events of &quot;The Defenders&quot;, Karen is still refusing to believe that Matt is dead. To that end, she is hyperfixating on the Midland Circle collapse to a degree that Ellison begins to show concern and insists on paying the rent for his apartment even though she can barely afford her own. Ellison and his wife Lily also try to set Karen up for a date with his nephew Jason, with minimal success. Her belief that Matt is still alive is piqued when Ellison sends her to interview Neda Kazemi, a socialite whose father was rescued by Matt from assailants who attacked him on Fisk&#x27;s orders to stop him from repurchasing a hotel he sold to one of Fisk&#x27;s shell companies.

When Fisk is released from prison, Ellison tries to sideline Karen, seeing as her past involvement with Fisk gives her a conflict of interest. Against Ellison&#x27;s wishes, Karen investigates and discovers that Fisk secretly owns the hotel he&#x27;s being kept under house arrest in but is threatened by Fisk&#x27;s fixer Felix Manning when she tries to get him on record regarding Fisk&#x27;s money laundering. When Fisk frames Matt as a scapegoat for Ray Nadeem, the FBI agent who brokered a deal to make Fisk into an informant, Karen reluctantly confides in Foggy the truth about Wesley&#x27;s murder as she believes the FBI will connect her to his death.

Sometime later, Matt shows up at Karen&#x27;s apartment asking for her help bringing in Jasper Evans, an inmate that Fisk paid to shank him as part of his plan to manipulate the FBI into letting him out of prison. Although Karen initially is hesitant to work with him, Foggy and Sister Maggie convince her to give Matt another chance. Matt and Karen track Evans down and decide to have him go on the record with the &quot;Bulletin&quot; regarding his part in Fisk&#x27;s schemes. However, Fisk finds out about their plans through the corrupt FBI agents on his security detail. Deciding that Evans is a liability that needs to be eliminated, Fisk gives Benjamin &quot;Dex&quot; Poindexter a Daredevil costume to frame the vigilante for an attack on the &quot;Bulletin&quot; just as Karen and Ellison are about to interview Evans. Despite Matt&#x27;s efforts to fight him off, Dex kills several of Karen&#x27;s coworkers, critically wounds Matt, Foggy, and Ellison, and easily disarms Karen before shooting Evans dead with her gun.

Karen is fired from the &quot;Bulletin&quot; when she refuses to give Matt&#x27;s identity over to a hospitalized Ellison. Incensed, Karen visits Fisk and tries to provoke him into attacking her by revealing that she accompanied Ben on his visit to Fisk&#x27;s mother. When that fails to elicit a reaction from Fisk, Karen changes gears and reveals to him that she murdered Wesley. Fisk attempts to strangle her on the spot, but is stopped by Foggy&#x27;s timely intervention. Fisk vows revenge and orders a hit on Karen as she hides out at Matt&#x27;s church. Matt and Karen manage to drive Dex off, but Father Lantom is killed while shielding Karen from one of Dex&#x27;s batons, and Matt is seriously injured. They are forced to hide in the church&#x27;s crypt afterwards as Dex and other corrupt FBI agents return to search the place for them, during which Karen confides in Matt about killing her brother and Wesley. They are only able to escape with assistance from Sister Maggie, Foggy, Brett, and Nadeem.

After Matt saves Nadeem and his family from an assassination attempt by Fisk&#x27;s henchmen, he and Foggy take on Nadeem as a client and negotiate with Blake Tower to have Nadeem testify about Fisk&#x27;s criminal activities in front of a grand jury, while Karen hosts a press conference on the courthouse steps to denounce him openly. The attempt fails after Fisk successfully intimidates the jurors into not indicting him. After Nadeem is subsequently murdered by Dex at his house on Vanessa&#x27;s orders, his widow delivers to Foggy a video confession he&#x27;d made hours before his death listing the various crimes that Fisk had ordered him and other FBI agents to commit for him, which Karen works with Ellison to publish on the internet in order to tarnish Fisk&#x27;s reputation. Matt subsequently breaks into Fisk&#x27;s penthouse, and after defeating Fisk and Dex in a fistfight, he coerces Fisk into agreeing to keep his knowledge of Matt&#x27;s secret identity quiet and leave Karen and Foggy alone in exchange for Matt not going after Vanessa for ordering Nadeem&#x27;s murder.

After Father Lantom&#x27;s funeral, Matt and Foggy invite Karen to rejoin their firm, this time as a licensed private detective, and rename it &quot;Nelson, Murdock, and Page&quot;.

====&quot;The Punisher&quot; season 2====
Karen briefly appears in the second season of &quot;The Punisher&quot;, where she shows up to help Frank escape from a hospital after Pilgrim puts a bounty out on him.

<doc id="416517" wikidata="Q381970" url="?curid=416517" title="Imad Mughniyeh">
<text>Imad Fayez Mughniyeh (; 7 December 1962 – 12 February 2008), also known by his nom de guerre al-Hajj Radwan (), was a Lebanese militant leader who was the founding member of Lebanon&#x27;s Islamic Jihad Organization and number two in Hezbollah&#x27;s leadership. He is believed to have been Hezbollah&#x27;s chief of staff and overseer of its military, intelligence, and security apparatus. He has been described as a skilled military tactician and a highly elusive figure. He was often referred to as an ‘untraceable ghost’.

U.S. and Israeli officials say Mughniyeh was directly and personally involved in terrorist attacks and the mastermind of many suicide bombings, murders, kidnappings, and assassinations. Mughniyeh formed Unit 121 as Hezbollah&#x27;s covert assassination squad and he was behind the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing and 1983 United States embassy bombing, in which over 350 people were killed, as well as the kidnapping of dozens of foreigners in Lebanon in the 1980s. He was indicted in Argentina for his role in the 1992 Israeli embassy attack in Buenos Aires. The highest-profile attacks he was involved in occurred in the early 1980s when Mughniyeh was in his early twenties. U.S. intelligence officials accused him of killing more United States citizens than any other man prior to the 11 September attacks.

Mughniyeh was known by his &quot;nom de guerre&quot; Al-Hajj Radwan. He was included in the European Union&#x27;s list of wanted terrorists and had a US$5 million bounty on the FBI Most Wanted Terrorists list. To many in his home country, Lebanon and the Middle East, he is a national symbol and hero.

As part of a joint CIA–Mossad operation, Mughniyeh was assassinated on the night of 12 February 2008 by a car bomb that was detonated as he passed by on foot, in the Kafr Sousa neighbourhood of Damascus, Syria.

==Early life==
Mughniyeh was born in the village of Tayr Dibba, near Tyre, on 7 December 1962 to a peasant family of Lebanon&#x27;s southern Shi&#x27;a heartland. His father&#x27;s name was Fayez. He was mistakenly thought to be the son of Jawad Mughniyeh, a religious cleric. His birth date had also been given as July 1962. Mughniyeh had two younger brothers, Jihad and Fouad. About a decade after Mughniyeh&#x27;s birth, the family moved to southern Beirut. CIA South Group records state that Mughniyeh lived in Ayn Al-Dilbah in South Beirut. Mughniyeh was described a popular boy and a &quot;natural entertainer&quot; who cracked jokes at family weddings and &quot;worked the crowd with a confidence unusual for a youth his age.&quot;

Mughniyeh and his cousin Mustafa Badreddine joined Fatah at an early age. Mughniyeh was discovered by fellow Lebanese Ali Abu Hassan Deeb (who would later become a Hezbollah leader) and quickly rose through the ranks of the movement. In the mid-1970s, Mugniyeh organized the &quot;Student Brigade,&quot; a unit of 100 young men which became part of Yasser Arafat&#x27;s elite Force 17. Mughniyeh temporarily left Fatah in 1981 due to differences of opinion on the regime of Saddam Hussein. Mughniyeh, a religious Shiite, was upset by the murder of the Iraqi Grand Ayatollah Muhammad Baqir as-Sadr in 1980 as well as a previous attempt by the Iraqi intelligence on the life of Lebanese Ayatollah Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah.

Fatah was formally allied with the Lebanese National Movement, which included the pro-Iraqi branch of the Ba&#x27;ath Party. Mughniyeh was forced to leave Fatah after armed confrontations with Ba’th activists. He and his comrades organized a body guard unit for Ayatollah Fadlallah and other Shiite clerics in Lebanon. Mughniyeh accompanied Ayatollah Fadlallah on a Hajj pilgrimage in 1980 and thus earned his Hajj title.

Mughniyeh was briefly a student in the engineering department at the American University of Beirut. After the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, he rejoined Fatah. He was wounded in the fighting in
West Beirut. After the withdrawal of PLO forces from Beirut in September 1982, Mughniyeh played a key role in resisting the Israeli occupation, revealing the location of Fatah arms caches. He remained a Fatah member during this period but also worked the leftist Lebanese National Movement and Islamic resistance groups. In 1984, he joined the newly created Islamic Resistance of Hezbollah. However, he remained close to Fatah leader Khalil al-Wazir (Abu Jihad) until the latter&#x27;s assassination in 1988. He remained committed to the Palestine cause throughout his life and founded Hezbollah&#x27;s secret &quot;Committee for Elimination of Israel&quot; in 2000. In later years, and especially after the Oslo accords, Mughniyeh and Hezbollah sided with the more militant Palestinian factions such as Hamas and the Islamic Jihad.

Mughniyeh worked as the chief security for Sayyed Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah, a Shiia cleric and a spiritual mentor to many in Lebanon&#x27;s Shi&#x27;a community, whose political consciousness was on the rise. Fadlallah held no formal political role, &quot;opposed violence and sectarian division, and defied growing Iranian influence in Lebanon.&quot;

==Personal life==
In 1983, Mughniyeh married his cousin, Saada Badr Al Din, who is the sister of Mustafa Badreddine. Mughniyeh had three children according to his mother: Fatima (born August 1984), Mustafa (born January 1987), and Jihad (estimated to have been age 25 at death). In September 1991, Mugniyeh&#x27;s wife and children were sent to Tehran for security reasons. Later his family began to live in south Lebanon. Mughniyeh also married an Iranian woman, Wafaa Mughniyeh, with whom he lived in Damascus.

On 21 December 1994 a car bomb in Chyah, Beirut, killed Mughniyeh&#x27;s brother, Fuad. Two other people were killed in the explosion and sixteen wounded.

Mughniyeh&#x27;s younger son, Jihad, was killed in the January 2015 Mazraat Amal incident in the Syrian Golan sector on 18 January 2015. Five other Hezbollah members and an Iranian Quds Force general were also killed in the attack.

==Personality==
According to former CIA agent Robert Baer, &quot;Mughniyah is probably the most intelligent, most capable operative we’ve ever run across, including the KGB or anybody else. He enters by one door, exits by another, changes his cars daily, never makes appointments on a telephone, never is predictable. He only uses people that are loyal to him that he can fully trust. He doesn&#x27;t just recruit people.&quot; He was described as &quot;tall, slender, well-dressed and handsome ... penetrating eyes,&quot; speaking some English but better French.

&quot;Both bin Laden and Mughniyeh were pathological killers,&quot; 30-year veteran CIA officer Milton Bearden said. &quot;But there was always a nagging amateurishness about bin Laden—his wildly hyped background, his bogus and false claims. … Bin Laden cowered and hid. Mughniyeh spent his life giving us the finger.&quot;

Nasrallah also stated that, &quot;Hajj Imad is among the best leaders and commanders in the Lebanese arena. He had an important role during the occupation [of southern Lebanon by Israel] by 2000. But as for his relationship with Hezbollah, we maintain the tradition of not discussing names.&quot;

After his death, Mugniyeh acquired a storied and folkloric persona. To many in his home country, Lebanon, and in the Middle East, he symbolizes resistance to foreign military occupation, a hero and a mastermind who single-handedly drove out the American and Israeli armies. The man behind the stabbing of Salman Rushdie, had a fake driver&#x27;s license with the name Hassan Mughniyah, which suggests a mix between the forename and surname of Hassan Nasrallah and Imad Mughniyeh, respectively.

According to his family, he was a dedicated father and had a reputation for modesty, respect and humility, to the extent that his neighbors in Syria thought he was a driver for the Iranian embassy.

==Allegations==
U.S. and Israeli officials have implicated Mughniyeh of many terrorist attacks, primarily against American and Israeli targets. These include 18 April 1983 bombing of the United States embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, which killed 63 people including 17 Americans whom among them were 7 CIA officers which included Robert Ames, the head of the Near East Division.

Mughniyeh was also accused of planning and organising the 23 October 1983 truck bombings against French paratroopers and the U.S. Marine barracks, attacks which killed 60 French soldiers and 240 Marines. While a student at the American University of Beirut (AUB) on 18 January 1984, Mughniyeh allegedly assassinated Malcolm H. Kerr (father of former NBA player/current coach Steve Kerr), the school&#x27;s president. On 20 September 1984, he is alleged to have attacked the US embassy annex building.

The United States indicted Mughniyeh (and his collaborator, Hassan Izz al-Din) for the 14 June 1985 hijacking of TWA Flight 847, in which he tortured and murdered the U.S. Navy Seabee diver Robert Stethem. Mughniyeh and his men allegedly tortured Stethem for hours, before killing him and dumping his body onto the airport tarmac.

U.S. and Israeli officials have also alleged that Mughniyeh was involved in numerous kidnappings of Americans in Beirut during the 1980s, most notably the kidnapping of Terry Anderson, Terry Waite, and William Francis Buckley, who was the CIA station chief in Beirut. Some of these individuals were killed by Mughniyeh directly, such as Buckley, who was subjected to extreme psychological and medical torture under the supervision of the psychiatrist Aziz al-Abub. The remainder were released at various times, with the last one, Terry Anderson, released in 1991. On 30 September 1985, Mughniyeh allegedly organised the kidnapping of four diplomats from the Soviet Embassy in Beirut, one of whom he personally killed. The result of the kidnapping was Soviet pressure on Syria to stop its operations in Northern Lebanon in exchange for the release of the remaining three hostages.

Mughniyeh was formally charged by Argentina for his alleged involvement on 17 March 1992 bombings of the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires, which killed 29, and of the AMIA cultural building in July 1994, killing 85 people. In March 2007, the Interpol issued &quot;red notices&quot; for his and others&#x27; alleged roles in the attack.

In addition, Mughniyeh allegedly planned the killing of Micha Tamir, the IDF general in Lebanon, and two IDF soldiers on 6 April 1992.

U.S. and Israeli officials have also alleged that Mugniyeh was the mastermind of the Khobar Towers bombing in 1996, which killed 19 American air force personnel and a Saudi civilian.

Israeli officials accuse Mughniyeh of orchestrating the October 2000 capture of three IDF soldiers in northern Israel, and of the kidnapping of IDF colonel Elchanan Tenenbaum. They also accuse Mughniyeh of overseeing the 2006 cross border raid that killed eight soldiers and abducted two during Israel&#x27;s 2006 incursion into Lebanon.

==Organizational affiliation==
In 2002, Mughniyeh was linked to the Karine A incident in which the Palestinian Authority was accused of importing fifty tons of weapons. He was a member of Force 17, an armed branch of the Fatah movement charged with providing security for Yasser Arafat and other prominent PLO officials.

In mid-February 1997, the pro-Israeli South Lebanese Army radio station reported that Iran&#x27;s intelligence service had dispatched Mughniyeh to Lebanon to directly supervise the reorganisation of Hezbollah&#x27;s security and military apparatus concerned with Palestinian affairs in Lebanon and to work as a security liaison between Hezbollah and Iranian intelligence. Mughniyeh also reportedly controlled Hezbollah&#x27;s security apparatus, the Special Operations Command, which handles intelligence and conducts overseas terrorist acts. Allegedly, although he used Hezbollah as a cover, he reported to the Iranians. According to Jeffery Goldberg, writing in the &quot;New Yorker&quot;, &quot;It is believed that Mugniyeh takes orders from the office of Iran&#x27;s supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, but that he reports to a man named Qasem Soleimani, the chief of a branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps called Al Quds, or the Jerusalem Force—the arm of the Iranian government responsible for sponsoring terror attacks on Israeli targets.&quot; In January 2002, a US cable also stated that Mughniyeh left Hezbollah and got closer to Iran. However, Mughniyeh was a member of Hezbollah&#x27;s jihadist council until his death in February 2008. After the July 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, he was assigned by Hezbollah to improve the military capabilities of the resistance in Lebanon; Damascus was his centre for this activity.

The European Union listed him as &quot;Hezbollah&#x27;s Chief of Staff&quot;.

==Arrest warrants and attempted assassination==
Various law and intelligence enforcement agencies attempted to capture Mughniyeh. The United States tried to secure his capture in France in 1986, but were thwarted by French officials&#x27; refusal to arrest him.

The United States tried to capture him several times afterward, beginning with a 1995 US special forces Delta Force operation that was put in place after the CIA was tipped off that Mughniyeh was flying a Middle East Airlines charter flight Airbus A310 from Khartoum to Beirut after a meeting with several Hezbollah leaders, and was scheduled to make a stop-over in Saudi Arabia. But Saudi security officers refused to allow the plane to make its stop-over, thwarting American attempts to arrest Mughniyeh.

The following year, the U.S. Navy planned to seize him from a Pakistani ship in Doha, Qatar, but the operation was called off. The plan, dubbed Operation RETURN OX, was carried out by ships and sailors of Amphibious Squadron Three (USS Tarawa, USS Duluth, USS Rushmore), Marines of the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit, and Navy SEALs assigned to the U.S. Fifth Fleet. The operation was underway, but was cancelled at the last minute when it could not be fully verified that Mughniyeh was on board the Pakistani ship.

On 10 October 2001, Mughniyeh appeared on the initial list of the FBI&#x27;s top 22 Most Wanted Terrorists, which was released to the public by President Bush, with a reward of up to $15 million offered for information leading to his arrest. The reward was later increased to $25 million. This reward remained outstanding as of 2006. Mughniyeh was on 42 countries&#x27; wanted lists.

The Israeli intelligence service Mossad made numerous attempts to assassinate Mughniyeh. His brother Fuad, a car shop owner, was killed in a 1994 Beirut car bombing, and another brother, Jihad, was killed in a car-bombing assassination attempt on the life of Hezbollah founder Sheikh Fadlallah in 1985, the work of the CIA via the South Lebanese Army. Israel planned to assassinate Mughniyeh when he attended the funeral of his brother Fuad, but he failed to show up.

Jeffrey Goldberg suggested that Mughniyeh, representing Hezbollah in Lebanon, attended a high-level meeting between Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

==Assassination==
Imad Mughniyeh was killed on 12 February 2008 by a car bomb blast at around 23:00 in the Kafr Sousa neighborhood of Damascus, Syria. According to &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, Mughniyeh was at a reception marking the 29th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution hosted by the Iranian ambassador to Syria, Ahmad Musavi. Mughniyeh left the party shortly after 22:30 and walked to his Mitsubishi Pajero. The spare tyre had been replaced by one with a high explosive, which was detonated as Mughniyeh walked past. The blast completely destroyed the car, left minimum damage on nearby buildings and killed only Mughniyeh. A Syrian government investigation found that he was killed by a car bomb that was parked nearby and that was detonated remotely.

Israel officially denied being behind the killing, but Mughniyeh reportedly had been a target of Mossad assassination attempts since the 1990s. On 27 February 2008, &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; reported that &quot;Al-Quds Al-Arabi&quot; had written that anonymous &quot;Syrian sources&quot; had claimed that &quot;several Arab nations conspired with Mossad&quot; in the assassination of Mughniyeh.

The U.S. Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell has suggested that it was also possible that Syrian intelligence was responsible for the killing. Ba&#x27;athist dissident and former Vice President Abdul Halim Khaddam stated in 2008 that Syrian intelligence orchestrated the killing of Mughniyeh under orders from the Assad regime. According to Khaddam, Assad&#x27;s removal of Assef Shawkat as Syria&#x27;s intelligence chief was due to Shawkat&#x27;s investigation claiming that an explosion &quot;had taken place inside the car&quot; which went against official line toed by Assad, which was that the death was caused due to &quot;the explosion of a gas tank&quot;. Without naming a source, the German newspaper &quot;Die Welt&quot; wrote that a story had been circulated amongst German diplomatic staff that it was possible that associates of late Assef Shawkat had assassinated Mughniyeh. This would have been in revenge for Mughniyeh tipping off Syrian President Bashar al-Assad regarding a coup plotted against him, which the Syrian government had foiled a couple of days before his assassination. Releasing the story in advance of going to print, &quot;Die Welt&quot; said the Syrian embassy in Berlin had rejected the coup story as utterly untrue. Lebanese politicians Walid Jumblatt and Saad Hariri as well as Mughniyeh&#x27;s Iranian widow also accused Syrian officials. His widow, after returning to Iran from Damascus, stated &quot;This is why the Syrian regime has refused the help of Iran and Hizbollah in the investigation of the murder... The Syrian traitors assisted in my husband’s murder.&quot; However, later she denied her statements. According to a leaked US official report, top Syrian officials were stunned by the assassination of Mughniyeh and engaged in an internecine struggle to blame each other for the breach of security that resulted in Mughniyeh&#x27;s death.

The Kuwaiti newspaper &quot;Al Rai&quot; reported that Hezbollah intelligence sources said they would retaliate for Mughniyeh&#x27;s death by assassinating Israeli leaders.

&quot;Newsweek&quot; reported that in 2007 Mossad&#x27;s director general, Meir Dagan, tipped the CIA off about the location of Mughniyeh in Kafr Sousa, Damascus. The two Mossad agents had the roles of monitoring his movements and confirming Mughniyeh&#x27;s identity using advanced facial recognition technology, while the CIA officer later detonated the bomb.

===Reactions===

Mughniyeh&#x27;s body was taken to Beirut and buried in Rawdat al-Shahidain Cemetery. A funeral was organized by Hezbollah on 14 February. Senior Iranian officials attended the service; Ali Akbar Velayati representing the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and Foreign Minister Manuchehr Mottaki representing President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. At the funeral, Hassan Nasrallah appeared via video link and in the eulogy delivered for his fallen comrade, declared: &quot;You crossed the borders. Zionists, if you want an open war, let it be an open war anywhere.&quot; Lebanese senior cleric Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah said that &quot;the resistance has lost one of its pillars.&quot; Iran condemned the killing as &quot;yet another brazen example of organised state terrorism by the Zionist regime&quot; (Israel). A symbolic tomb was erected for Mughniyeh in the Behesht-e-Zahra cemetery of Tehran. Later the Iranian government named a street in Tehran after Imad Mughniyeh as well.

The assassination of Mughniyeh was condemned in some parts of the world. Then Italian Foreign Minister Massimo D&#x27;Alema termed the assassination &quot;terror&quot; in an interview, while Gideon Levy of the Israeli newspaper &quot;Haaretz&quot; claimed the assassination actually undermined Israel&#x27;s security.

The Bush administration welcomed news of Mugniyeh&#x27;s death. A spokesman of the U.S. State Department said: &quot;The world is a better place without this man in it. He was a coldblooded killer, a mass murderer and a terrorist responsible for countless innocent lives lost. One way or another he was brought to justice.&quot; Danny Yatom, former head of the Israeli Mossad said: &quot;He was one of the most dangerous terrorists ever on Earth.&quot;

After Mughniyeh&#x27;s killing, Hezbollah&#x27;s elite Intervention Unit was renamed the Redwan Force after his operational alias Hajj Radwan (الحاج رضوان) in April 2008.

On the 10th anniversary of Mugniyeh&#x27;s killing, Iranian Major General Qasem Soleimani, commander of the Quds Force of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, described Mugniyeh as &quot;the legend of our time,&quot; grief caused by whose loss was only second to that of Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Soleimani said that what made Mugniyeh unique was not his expertise in guerrilla warfare but &quot;his attachment to something superterrestrial.&quot; Soleimani stressed that &quot;the enemy must recognize that avenging Mughniyah&#x27;s death won&#x27;t be fulfilled by launching a missile or killing someone in response, but bloods like these will be only avenged by full destruction of the Zionist regime&quot; which he said was &quot;a definite Divine promise.&quot; (Less than two years later, Soleimani himself was assassinated in a targeted U.S. drone strike in January 2020 in Baghdad.)

<text>A puppet ruler is someone who holds a title of political authority, but is loyal to or controlled by outside persons or groups. When a foreign government wields such outside control, the puppet ruler&#x27;s territory is referred to as a puppet state. Internal factors, such as non-elected officials, may also exert power over the puppet monarch. A figurehead monarch, as a source of legitimacy and perhaps divine reign, has been the used form of government in numerous circumstances and places throughout history.

There are two basic forms of puppet monarchs: a figurehead monarch who is a puppet of another person or a group in the country who rules instead of the nominal ruler; and a puppet government under a foreign power. Examples of the first type are the Emperors who were the puppets of the shōguns of Japan and the kings who were the puppets of the Mayor of Palace in the Frankish kingdom. Client kingdoms under the Roman Republic and Roman Empire and the British Empire&#x27;s colonial relationship with King Farouk of Egypt in the 1950s are examples of the second type.

==List of puppet kings and queens==
===Classical antiquity===

<text>The New Zealand and Australian Division was a composite army division raised for service in the First World War under the command of Major General Alexander Godley. Consisting of several mounted and standard infantry brigades from both New Zealand and Australia, it served in the Gallipoli Campaign between April and December 1915.

At Gallipoli, the division landed at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915, coming ashore as follow-on troops to the initial assault force that had made it ashore earlier in the day, and later occupied the northern areas of the Allied lodgement. After the initial Allied assault at Anzac Cove, elements of the division were sent to Cape Helles in early May, where they participated in the Second Battle of Krithia, launching an unsuccessful attack towards the Achi Baba peak. The division&#x27;s mounted units were sent to Gallipoli in mid-May without their horses, to serve as dismounted infantry, making up for previous losses. Later that month, the division helped repel an Ottoman counter-attack at Anzac Cove, after which it occupied the line until August, when the Allies launched an offensive designed to break the deadlock. During this period, the division attacked Chunuk Bair and Hill 971, and then later Hill 60. These efforts failed, and as winter set in on the peninsula, the division was evacuated from Gallipoli in mid-December 1915 as part of a general Allied withdrawal.

Returning to Egypt, the division was disbanded in early 1916 following a reorganisation of the Australian and New Zealand forces. The division&#x27;s constituent infantry brigades were then used to form the Australian 4th Division and the New Zealand Division. These two formations would then be sent to the Western Front where they would take part in further fighting throughout 1916–1918, while the division&#x27;s former mounted elements went on to serve in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign as part of the Anzac Mounted Division.

==History==
===Formation===
Following the outbreak of the First World War in early August 1914, the New Zealand government made an offer to the British War Office of a New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF), which was duly accepted. Mobilisation quickly followed and by late September, the NZEF consisted of two brigades – the New Zealand Infantry Brigade and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade. This was insufficient to form a conventional infantry division, which usually consisted of three infantry brigades. In contrast, in Australia there were more than enough volunteers for the Australian Imperial Force (AIF). The original intention had been to form a single infantry division, along with a light horse brigade; however, there were enough volunteers to meet this with a surplus of infantrymen being sufficient to form another brigade. Initially, it had been planned to send the NZEF and the AIF to the United Kingdom for training prior to their deployment to the Western Front in France; however, as the convoy carrying the troops transited the Suez Canal they were disembarked in Egypt to temporarily help defend the canal following the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s entry into the war. Later, overcrowding and a shortage of equipment in the United Kingdom resulted in the decision for the Australians and New Zealanders to remain in the Middle East.

In December 1914, the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, under Lieutenant General William Birdwood, was formed to command both the Australian and New Zealand components, which were under the respective commands of Major Generals William Bridges and Alexander Godley. The headquarters staff for this formation amounted to 70 officers and 550 men. These were mostly provided by the British and it was formally part of the British Army. A corps normally had a complement of two infantry divisions, but given the numbers of mounted troops in the AIF and NZEF, Birdwood envisaged that the corps would include a mounted division. As only one complete infantry division (the 1st Australian Division) was present in Egypt, the NZEF and remaining AIF forces in Egypt were to form the other infantry division. Birdwood decided to combine the New Zealand Infantry Brigade with the Australian 4th Infantry Brigade, with a third brigade to be included if one could be formed. By early 1915, Birdwood scrapped the plans for the corps to have an integral mounted division and instead included two mounted infantry brigades with the two standard infantry brigades to form the second infantry division. This was to be known as the New Zealand and Australian Division, with Godley as its commander. A British Army officer, Godley had previously served as commandant of the New Zealand Military Forces from 1910. As well as the four infantry and mounted brigades, the division also included artillery. This was contributed by the NZEF, but only consisted of 16 guns, including four howitzers, much less than the normal divisional complement of artillery. Headquarters staff were also drawn from the NZEF. Supporting arms included engineers, medical, signals, and service corps units. The division was initially short of engineers and transport personnel, with deficiencies being made good through recruitment of New Zealanders living in the United Kingdom, or through re-allocating reinforcements from other units.

While the division was forming and training in Egypt, elements were committed to the defence of the Suez Canal. On 26 January 1915, the four infantry battalions of the New Zealand Infantry Brigade – the Auckland, Canterbury, Wellington and Otago Battalions – and a supporting field ambulance were deployed in anticipation of an attack on the canal by Ottoman forces. This force was split between Ismailia and Kubri. On 2 February, after the Ottomans launched a raid on the Suez Canal, elements of the brigade took part in repelling the attack, with the Canterbury Battalion suffering the division&#x27;s first losses in battle, with two men being wounded, one of whom later died.

===Landing at Anzac Cove===
The New Zealand and Australian Division was the second division of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps that landed at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915. The Australian 1st Division made the initial landing and the New Zealand and Australian Division came ashore as the day progressed. For the initial landing, all troops coming ashore at Anzac Cove were under Bridges&#x27; command, although the division&#x27;s headquarters was landed around 10:00 am. Command would revert to Godley the following day. The New Zealand Infantry Brigade, temporarily commanded by Colonel Harold Walker, began coming ashore at 10:45 am. Meanwhile, Colonel (later General Sir) John Monash&#x27;s Australian 4th Brigade was held in reserve offshore. The first to enter the battle was the Auckland Battalion, followed by half of the Canterbury Battalion, which had completed its embarkation just after noon. Tasked with extending the Allied line to the left of the Australian 3rd Brigade to the north of the landing beach, they were directed towards Walker&#x27;s Ridge, advancing by way of Shrapnel and Monash Valley.

The advance proved heavy going, but they soon found themselves involved in the struggle around Baby 700, amidst chaotic fighting as the Ottomans launched a counter-attack. Baby 700 was subsequently lost, and in the aftermath the New Zealanders took up positions along Walker&#x27;s Ridge, which formed the extreme left flank of the landing area, reinforcing the Australians around Russell&#x27;s Top. The Otago Battalion landed between noon and 5:00 pm, and moved up to support the Aucklanders. Having failed to secure the key ridges of Chunuk Bair and Sari Bair, Godley and his Australian opposite, Bridges, advocated for the troops to be re-embarked at the end of the day; however, the decision was made to consolidate the lodgement despite the Ottomans holding the high ground.

The Wellington Battalion began arriving under darkness and were sent to Plugge&#x27;s Plateau, while first elements of Australian 4th Brigade – three companies of the 15th Battalion – began coming ashore around midnight. As they arrived, they were sent to fill the gap between the left and right flanks of the Anzac perimeter, which required holding positions across the head of Monash Valley. As a result of these dispositions, by the end of the first day the New Zealand and Australian Division held the left flank of the landing and the 1st Division held the right and centre. Early morning on the second day, three battalions of the Australian 4th Brigade – the 13th, 15th and 16th – came ashore, along with some personnel from the Wellington Battalion and a section of the New Zealand Howitzer Battery, operating 4.5-inch howitzers. Due to the confused and haphazard landing, many units had become disorganised and mixed in together upon coming ashore. Throughout the day, efforts were made to rectify this, and by the end of the day the New Zealand and Australian Division largely held the northern part of the Allied line, from Courtney&#x27;s Post and beyond. Throughout the day, the Allied line was subjected to localised attacks.

On 27 April, the Ottomans launched a second counter-attack at Anzac Cove, resulting in heavy fighting around the perimeter. It was eventually repulsed with heavy losses. During this fighting, the New Zealand machine gun sections that were attached to each battalion were heavily committed. Having pushed as close to the front as possible to support their battalions, the crews suffered heavy casualties from Ottoman snipers. Meanwhile, the division&#x27;s field artillery was landed throughout the day and with great effort the guns were moved into position to begin providing the indirect fire support that had been desperately needed during the first two days of fighting.

Throughout the remainder of the week, the Allied troops continued to consolidate their positions around Anzac Cove, digging in and establishing lines of communication and supply. The Ottoman troops continued to hold the high ground, and the Anzac positions remained under observation and fire from snipers and machine guns. Ottoman mountain guns also kept up a steady bombardment. As the landing around Anzac was consolidated throughout the first week ashore, efforts were made to destroy two observation posts overlooking the cove from its flanks: Gaba Tepe to the south, and Nibrunesi Point to the north, near Suvla Bay. Early on 2 May, a party of around 50 New Zealanders, drawn from the Canterbury Battalion, were assigned to attack Nibrunesi Point. Landing from a destroyer, they quickly overcame the small party of Ottoman troops holding the position. Although no guns were located, several buildings were then destroyed before the party re-embarked around midday. Meanwhile, two days later, a detachment from the Australian 1st Division&#x27;s 11th Battalion unsuccessfully attempted to raid the position around Gaba Tepe.

===Consolidation at Anzac Cove===


In the second week after the landing, efforts were made to straighten the Allied line, to prevent a salient from forming between Pope&#x27;s Hill and Quinn&#x27;s Post. Godley was ordered to recapture Baby 700, which was considered a key feature of the northern perimeter, allowing the Ottoman troops observation and fields of fire down important Allied avenues of approach. On 1 May, an Ottoman counter-attack was held off, and at 7:00 pm the following night, the division launched its attack on the left flank: the Canterbury Battalion around Walker&#x27;s and the Otago Battalion around Pope&#x27;s, tasked with maintaining contact with the Australian 4th Brigade, which was to advance around the far end of Monash Gully (sometimes also called Shrapnel Gully). Under Colonel Francis Johnston, who had been ill during the landing and had temporarily deferred his command to Walker, the New Zealand Infantry Brigade was tasked with assaulting the western aspect of Baby 700, while the Australians rushed the southern slope.

Commencing at 7:15 pm, the two Australian assault battalions – the 13th and 16th – were only able to push forward about , while the Otago Battalion was held up on its approach march from Walker&#x27;s and were delayed by 90 minutes. Lacking artillery support to suppress the Ottoman defenders, upon their arrival the Otago Battalion took heavy fire. Almost half the battalion became casualties, but they managed to secure some of the lower parts of the feature, holding on overnight even though the Canterbury Battalion&#x27;s attack was checked and turned back, having been hampered by poor maps and unfamiliarity with night attacks. Throughout the night, Ottoman troops attacked the Otago Battalion with grenades. At midnight, a company from the Australian 15th Battalion was pushed forward into the gap that had formed between the Otago Battalion and the Australian 13th. The following day a brief counter-attack was launched by the Ottomans, but the Anzac defensive line held, after which marines from the Royal Naval Division launched an attack between Quinn&#x27;s and Pope&#x27;s around Dead Man&#x27;s Ridge, which was unsuccessful and resulted in heavy casualties. By the morning of 3 May, Dead Man&#x27;s Ridge was firmly under Ottoman control.

The failure of the second attempt to take Baby 700 marked the end of the first phase of the fighting around Anzac Cove. Following this, the most forward part of the Anzac line was Quinn&#x27;s Post. Having been occupied initially on the first day of the landing by troops from the Australian 4th Brigade, the position allowed Allied troops to move between several positions without observation. However, the Ottoman position around Dead Man&#x27;s Ridge offered them a good firing position into the rear of the Allied position at Quinn&#x27;s, and necessitated heavy sandbagging along the tracks to protect those moving up to the position. As a result, New Zealand engineers worked to build sandbag walls to protect the tracks around Quinn&#x27;s, and to dig a sap trench to advance the Allied firing line.

===Krithia===

As the situation around Anzac Cove settled, the British commander, Hamilton, decided to advance the line that had been established around Cape Helles, south of the lodgement at Anzac. To assist the British, French and Indian troops, two brigades – the Australian 2nd and the New Zealand Infantry Brigades – were detached from Anzac Cove to help launch an attack on Krithia with a view to capturing the Achi Baba peak. Transported aboard several destroyers and barges from Anzac Cove south to Cape Helles, the detached New Zealanders were temporarily organised into an ad hoc composite division with the Australians and a naval brigade for the coming attack. On 7 May, ammunition and entrenching tools were issued before the New Zealanders began moving up towards Gully Beach, in the Gulf of Saros, on the Aegean side of the cape. Throughout the night, the brigade was tasked with forming a reserve for the 29th Division, but was not required to go into action.

On the morning of 8 May, the brigade received its orders to attack towards Krithia. Advancing along Fir Tree Spur, it would be a daylight assault with three battalions, while the Otago Battalion was placed in reserve, having suffered heavily at Baby 700. Planning for the attack was inadequate: there was no time given for preparation, and there was little knowledge of the objective, or the dispositions of the defending troops. Nevertheless, in the first effort, they attempted to charge across a position dubbed the Daisy Patch, near a dry creek bed and lacking any cover. As they went forward, the New Zealanders were engaged from both flanks. Coming under heavy machine gun and rifle fire from Ottoman defenders in the Gully Ravine, the attack was halted after only and the New Zealanders were forced to dig in by 3:00 pm. Throughout the afternoon, the New Zealanders endured constant fire on their positions, which continued to inflict casualties.

Around 5:00 pm, the Allies decided to make another effort, with the Australian 2nd Brigade launching a strong attack, which gained . The New Zealanders, on the left of the Australians, joined the attack, with the Auckland and Otago Battalions charging forward, alongside the British 88th Brigade, and clearing an Ottoman trench line with bayonets fixed. The main attack petered out after about two hours, having gained another , although the Canterbury Battalion worked throughout the evening to link up with the Australian 2nd Brigade. By the end of the day, the New Zealand Infantry Brigade had lost 835 casualties and was down to a strength of 1,700 men, having started the campaign with 4,000. Throughout the night, the New Zealanders consolidated their position and in the morning, took over part of the Allied line from the British 87th Brigade. They held this sector against several Ottoman counter-attacks until early morning on 12 May, when the New Zealanders were relieved by the British 42nd Division. Several days were then spent in camp around the Krithia road until the evening of 19 May when the brigade embarked to return to Anzac Cove, where an Ottoman counter-attack had begun. A New Zealand artillery battery, however, remained at Helles until August.

===Reinforcement===
Normally a British or dominion division contained three brigades. At the time of the landing at Anzac Cove, the intention had been to complete the New Zealand and Australian Division with the 29th Indian Brigade, commanded by Brigadier General Vaughan Cox; however, as the situation at the Helles landing deteriorated, General Sir Ian Hamilton directed Cox&#x27;s brigade there to support the British 29th Division. Casualties had been heavy amongst the Australians and New Zealanders in the first period of fighting, with 1,395 casualties (killed, wounded and missing) among Australian units attached to the division and 1,667 from the New Zealand elements up to 15 May 1915. Total losses amongst the ANZAC Corps amounted to around 8,000 casualties in the period from the landing to 3 May. To make up for the deficiencies caused by the detachment to Krithia, and the losses from disease and combat, in mid-May 1915, Australian and New Zealand mounted soldiers began arriving at Gallipoli as reinforcements. Arriving without their horses, they were to serve in a dismounted role as normal infantry. At this time, the Australian 1st Light Horse Brigade, under Colonel Harry Chauvel, and Brigadier General Andrew Russell&#x27;s New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade joined the division. As mounted brigades contained fewer men than infantry brigades, and these brigades had left a portion of their strength in Egypt to attend to the horses, each brigade mustered only about 1,500 men. Chauvel&#x27;s men had reinforced the Royal Marines and Australian 4th Brigade, around Monash Valley, while the New Zealand Mounted Rifles reinforced Walker&#x27;s Ridge and Russell&#x27;s Top. Shortly after their arrival, 100 men from the Canterbury Mounted Rifles carried out another raid of Nibrunesi Point, which was being used by Ottoman artillery observers to direct fire onto the beachhead, although the position was found to be deserted at the time of the raid.

===Ottoman counter-attack at Anzac===
On 19 May, at Anzac, the Ottomans launched a determined counter-attack with the intention of forcing the Allies to evacuate. Forewarned, the Allies were ready for the counter-attack, having moved reinforcements up behind the line. Just after midnight, heavy grenade attacks began along the positions held by the New Zealanders, and an artillery duel began. The assault began at around 3:00 am, as several waves of Ottoman troops charged the Allied line. Beaten back with determined machine gun and rifle fire, the effort was repelled with heavy losses being inflicted on the attackers. The defensive fighting during this period was the first major action fought by the newly arrived New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade who occupied a position around Walker&#x27;s Ridge. The Australian 4th Brigade, at the head of Monash Valley, was also heavily involved in repulsing the attack, with the 14th Battalion heavily engaged around Courtney&#x27;s Post and the 15th Battalion holding on around Quinn&#x27;s. The 13th Battalion, and part of the 16th, were held in reserve in Monash Valley. One member of the 14th Battalion, Albert Jacka, received the Victoria Cross for his actions during the fighting on 19 May.

The attack had failed along the length of the line, and was halted the evening of the 19th. The attack was briefly resumed on 20 May, but again the machine guns turned back the attack, which was quickly halted. Losses during the counter-attack stretched the Allied reinforcement system and throughout May dismounted light horsemen arrived as replacements. A lull in the fighting followed, including a brief truce to bury the dead on 24 May, but the quiet was broken in the afternoon with a heavy exchange of fire before a quiet evening.

The next major action came on 28 May, when a squadron from the Canterbury Mounted Rifles attacked an Ottoman position which had been firing down on their position around Nelson Hill (No. 2 Post). Over the course of several days, during the Battle for No.3 Post the New Zealanders took the position and then attempted to hold it amidst heavy counter-attacks, before eventually retiring on 30 May. Meanwhile, on 29 May, the Ottomans attacked the Australian 4th Brigade around Quinn&#x27;s. Mining operations had begun earlier in the month and although the Australians began counter-mining, early on 29 May, a large explosion destroyed part of the Australian line around Quinn&#x27;s. A party of Turks then broke into the position, but after several hours of heavy close-quarters fighting, the Australian 15th Battalion restored their line. In the process, several trenches were heavily damaged and required repair. After the fighting, in early June, the Australian 4th Brigade – having been in the line for five weeks – was relieved by the New Zealand Infantry Brigade. Total losses for the division up to the end of June equated to 5,014 killed, wounded or missing.
===August offensive===
====Chunuk Bair and Hill 971====
After taking over the positions around Courtney&#x27;s and Quinn&#x27;s Posts, the New Zealanders sought to reorganise and improve each of these positions, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel William Malone. Throughout June, while the Third Battle of Krithia raged around Helles, operations around Anzac focused mainly on improving the positions around the Allied line, although there were several small scale skirmishes with both sides sniping at each other and making grenade attacks. Tunnelling and sapping was also undertaken, and several minor attacks were carried out by the Ottomans, with the last one coming on 29/30 June. In July, Allied efforts turned towards preparations for a final offensive around Anzac to break the deadlock. To provide cover to assaulting troops moving from the beachhead to the outposts in the northern sector of the perimeter, the communication trench was widened by the Australians and New Zealanders throughout July. Maoris from the Native Contingent (later known as the New Zealand (Māori) Pioneer Battalion) arrived during this time, and assisted with the construction work.

The plan for the offensive focused upon the capture of the Sari Bair Range, with preliminary objectives being Hill 971 and Chunuk Bair to its south-west. Meanwhile, another landing would be made by predominately British forces at Suvla Bay, to the north of Anzac Cove, under the command of Lieutenant General Frederick Stopford. Godley was placed in overall command of the offensive around Hill 971 and Chunuk Bair. In July, the New Zealand and Australian Division was reinforced by elements of the 29th Indian Infantry Brigade and the British 13th Division in preparation for the coming offensive. For the initial attack, the division was split into two elements. Johnston&#x27;s New Zealand Infantry Brigade was to advance on the right up several steep features to capture Chunuk Bair via Rhododendron Ridge, while Monash and the Australian 4th Brigade was assigned to the left column under Cox, along with several British and Indian units, and was tasked with taking Hill 971.

Departing Anzac under cover of darkness on 6 August, the attack on Hill 971 went awry from the beginning. Hampered by poor maps and inadequate knowledge of the ground over which the assault was to take place, the 4th Brigade briefly became lost during the approach. In addition, as Monash&#x27;s soldiers felt uncertainly for their objective, they were harassed by small groups of Ottoman troops. The Australians were still well short of Hill 971 by dawn on 7 August. The following day, the 4th Brigade drove towards the Abdel Rahman spur line, where they came under heavy machine gun fire which halted their advance.

Meanwhile, the drive on Chunuk Bair by the New Zealand Infantry Brigade, spearheaded by the Aucklanders made better progress, but was stopped short of the summit. The delay subsequently impacted upon the Australian attack at the Nek. A renewed attack was made on 8 August by the Wellington Battalion, during which the New Zealanders pushed forward from the Pinnacle and up Rhododendron Ridge to capture the summit. The Aucklanders and two British battalions then reinforced the Wellingtons. As the offensive failed elsewhere, the Ottomans poured reinforcements against Chunuk Bair, subjecting the New Zealanders and British troops there to several determined counter-attacks. Finally, late on 9 August, the New Zealanders were relieved by two battalions of British troops. The position was finally retaken by the Ottomans on 10 August, following heavy close quarters fighting. For his actions on the summit, a New Zealand signaller, Cyril Bassett, received the Victoria Cross.

Elsewhere, while the majority of the division was focused on Chunuk Bair, Brigadier General Frederic Hughes&#x27; 3rd Light Horse Brigade – allocated as corps troops at Anzac, but assigned to Godley for the offensive – undertook a costly attack towards Baby 700 and the Nek. Ultimately a futile effort, it resulted in heavy casualties for no gain, partially due to the delays elsewhere. In support, two regiments of the Australian 1st Light Horse Brigade, positioned around Quinn&#x27;s and Pope&#x27;s, carried out several feint attacks. The attack around Quinn&#x27;s began around 4:30 am on 7 August, when the 2nd Light Horse Regiment sent in the first of four waves of 50 troops. Coming under heavy machine gun fire, 49 of the 50 men in the first wave were killed and wounded, after which the attack was eventually called off. The attack around Pope&#x27;s by the 1st Light Horse Regiment against the position dubbed the &quot;Chessboard&quot; fared little better, devolving into a series of grenade attacks that lasted three hours before the light horsemen withdrew, having lost 154 men out of the 200 that had been committed.

====Hill 60====
The final major attack at Gallipoli came at Hill 60, a small feature situated to the north-west of Hill 971, which offered the Allies a line of communications between the beach around Anzac Cove and Hill 971. This attack involved troops from the Australian 4th Brigade and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade (largely the Canterbury and Otago Rifles), as well as a battalion (the 18th) from the newly arrived 2nd Division, and the British Connaught Rangers and Hampshire Regiment. A supporting attack towards Susak Kuyu was also carried out on the left flank by two battalions of Gurkhas from the 29th Indian Infantry Brigade.

The first attempt, which was made on 21 August, managed to secure part of the hill, although Ottoman forces remained in possession of the top. A renewed effort on 22 August by 2nd Division troops resulted in heavy casualties due to hasty and poor planning. Some gains were made throughout the morning, but heavy grenade attacks ultimately forced the newly arrived troops back around 9:00 am. Two hours later, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles attacked again on the left, and took about of trench line, which was then secured with sandbags. A lull followed for several days, during which the two sides traded grenade attacks and sniped at each other while working to improve their positions.

The Australian 4th Brigade had been heavily depleted by the earlier fighting, and only 250 men remained available for the renewed attack on 27 August, which also involved troops from the New Zealand Mounted Rifles, reinforced by the Australian 9th and 10th Light Horse Regiments, and British troops from the Connaught Rangers. While the supporting preparatory artillery barrage proved ineffective, the assault eventually took some of the Ottoman trenches on the top of the hill. Nevertheless, it ultimately failed to secure the entire position. Three days of see-sawing close quarters fighting followed in which several counter-attacks were launched, and the position lost by the Allies, and then retaken. Finally, on 29 August, the fighting ended with the Allies occupying the southern half of the position, while the Ottomans held the northern half.

Losses during the fighting for Hill 60 had been heavy, and according to Harvey Broadbent it &quot;effectively ended the fighting capacity of the New Zealand Mounted Rifles&quot;. Out of 2,000 troops originally assigned to the brigade, 730 had gone into the fighting around Hill 60, and only 365 were fit afterwards. Meanwhile, the Australian 4th Brigade had also been heavily depleted, with a strength of only 968.

===Evacuation and disbandment===
Following the failure of the August offensives, a period of stalemate followed around Gallipoli. As sickness rates began to rise British commanders began considering evacuation before winter, with some strategists arguing that they should focus their efforts on the Western Front. Between mid-September and early November, the New Zealand brigades – except the supporting engineers, artillery and medical personnel – were able to detach elements for rest at Sarpi, on Lemnos, as the Australian 2nd Division arrived to relieve the two original Anzac divisions. In November, now Major General Andrew Russell took over as division commander from Godley, who had been given command of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps. Later the same month a heavy blizzard blew, bringing snow to Gallipoli, and after Lord Kitchener carried out an inspection of the theatre, the decision was made to withdraw the Allied troops from Gallipoli. This was completed in several phases, with the final 3,000 rearguard troops from the division, which had been holding positions between Hill 60, Hill 100, Cheshire Ridge and the Apex, departing on 20 December 1915.

Following the division&#x27;s evacuation, it moved back to Egypt via Lemnos. In January 1916, the two Australian divisions were moved to Tel-el-Kebir to help defend the Suez Canal, while the New Zealand and Australian Division was sent to Moascar camp, near Ismailia, in reserve. By this time, a large number of reinforcements from Australia and New Zealand had arrived in Egypt. Numbers were so large that they could not be absorbed into the existing formations; as a result, new formations were planned and permission was sought from both the Australian and New Zealand governments to begin the reorganisation, prior to their dispatch to the Western Front. The process of splitting the division began in late February 1916, when the Australian 4th Brigade and the Australian support troops departed Moascar to join the other Australian troops around Tel-el-Kebir. In their stead, replacement New Zealand units were brought on strength. On 1 March 1916, the process was completed with the division assuming its new designation of the New Zealand Division.

While the 4th Brigade would be used to form part the Australian 4th Division, the New Zealand components were formed into the standalone New Zealand Division. As part of this process, the New Zealand Infantry Brigade was formed into the 1st Infantry Brigade, keeping most of its experienced personnel, and was joined by the 2nd Infantry Brigade and the New Zealand Rifle Brigade, formed mainly from reinforcements with a small cadre of veterans. Together with the Australian 4th and 5th Divisions, the New Zealand Division was then formed into II ANZAC Corps under Godley prior to its dispatch to the Western Front, where they would see further fighting over the course of 1916–1918. The division&#x27;s mounted elements were re-united with their horses and organised into the Anzac Mounted Division, and took part in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign over the same period.

<text>Kitzbühel (, also: ; ) is a medieval town situated in the Kitzbühel Alps along the river Kitzbüheler Ache in Tyrol, Austria, about east of the state capital Innsbruck and is the administrative centre of the Kitzbühel district (). Kitzbühel is one of the most famous and exclusive ski resorts in the world. It is frequented primarily by the international high society and has the most expensive real estate in Austria. The proximity to Munich has made it a preferred location for vacation homes among the German elite.

== Geography ==

Kitzbühel is situated in the Kitzbühel Alps between Zell am See and Innsbruck. It lies in the Leukental valley on the Kitzbüheler Ache river.

The town is subdivided into the municipalities of Am Horn, Aschbachbichl, Badhaussiedlung, Bichlach, Ecking, Felseneck, Griesenau, Griesenauweg, Gundhabing, Hagstein, Hausstatt, Henntal, Jodlfeld, Kaps, Mühlau, Obernau, Schattberg, Seereith, Siedlung Frieden, Am Sonnberg, Sonnenhoffeld, Staudach, Stockerdörfl and Zephirau.

The neighbouring municipalities are Aurach bei Kitzbühel, Jochberg, Kirchberg in Tirol, Oberndorf in Tirol, Reith bei Kitzbühel, St. Johann in Tirol and Fieberbrunn.

Kitzbühel&#x27;s historic centre is mainly car-free and hosts a large selection of luxury shops, cafés and fine dining restaurants.

==History==

===Earliest people===
The first known settlers were Illyrians mining copper in the hills around Kitzbühel between 1100 and 800 BC.

Around 15 BC, the Romans under Emperor Augustus extended their empire to include the Alps and established the province of Noricum. After the fall of the western Roman Empire, Bavarii settled in the Kitzbühel region around 800 and started clearing forests.

===Middle Ages===
In the 12th century, the name &quot;Chizbuhel&quot; is mentioned for the first time in a document belonging to the Chiemsee monastery (where it refers to a &quot;Marquard von Chizbuhel&quot;), whereby &quot;Chizzo&quot; relates to a Bavarian clan and &quot;Bühel&quot; refers to the location of a settlement upon a hill. One hundred years later a source refers to the Vogtei of the Bamberg monastery in &quot;Kicemgespuchel&quot; and, in the 1271 document elevating the settlement to the status of a town, the place is called &quot;Chizzingenspuehel&quot;.

Kitzbühel became part of Upper Bavaria in 1255 when Bavaria was first partitioned. Duke Ludwig II of Bavaria granted Kitzbühel town rights on 6 June 1271, and it was fortified with defensive town walls. During the next centuries the town established itself as a market town, growing steadily and remaining unaffected by war and conflict. The town walls were eventually reduced to the level of a single storey building, and the stone used to build residential housing.

When Countess Margarete of Tyrol married the Bavarian, Duke Louis V the Brandenburger, in 1342, Kitzbühel was temporarily united with the County of Tyrol (that in turn became a Bavarian dominion as a result of the marriage until Louis&#x27; death). After the Peace of Schärding (1369) Kitzbühel was returned to Bavaria. Following the division of Bavaria, Kufstein went to the Landshut line of the House of Wittelsbach. During this time, silver and copper mining in Kitzbühel expanded steadily and comprehensive mining rights were issued to her that, later, were to become significant to the Bavarian dukedom. On 30 June 1504 Kitzbühel became a part of Tyrol permanently: the Emperor Maximilian reserved to himself the hitherto Landshut offices () of Kitzbühel, Kufstein and Rattenberg as a part of his Cologne Arbitration (), that had ended the Landshut War of Succession.

However, the law of Louis of Bavaria continued to apply to the three aforementioned places until the 19th century, so that these towns had a special legal status within Tyrol. Maximilian enfeoffed Kitzbühel, with the result that it came under the rule of the Counts of Lamberg at the end of the 16th century, until 1 May 1840, when Kitzbühel was ceremonially transferred to the state.

An inscription in the Swedish Chapel dating to the Swedish War states (&quot;The Swedish knights came as far as here but no further&quot;).

===18th century to modern day===
The wars of the 18th and 19th century bypassed the town, even though its inhabitants participated in the Tyrolean Rebellion against Napoleon. Following the Treaty of Pressburg in 1805, Kitzbühel once more became part of Bavaria; it was reunited with Tyrol after the fall of Napoleon at the Congress of Vienna. Until 1918, the town (named before 1895) was part of the Austrian monarchy (Austria side after the compromise of 1867), head of the district of the same name, one of the 21 in the Tyrol province.

When Emperor Franz Joseph finally resolved the confusing constitutional situation, and following completion of the Salzburg-Tyrol Railway in 1875, the town&#x27;s trade and industry flourished. In 1894, Kitzbühel hosted its first ski race, ushering in a new era of tourism and sport.

In 1924 Alban Ernan Forbes Dennis, a British diplomat and spy, with his wife, the novelist Phyllis Bottome, started the Tennerhof school in Kitzbühel. Based on the teaching of languages, the school was intended to be a community and an educational laboratory to determine how psychology (specifically the theories of Alfred Adler) and educational theory could cure the ills of nations. Among the pupils were the future authors Ralph Arnold, Nigel Dennis, Ian Fleming and Cyril Connolly.

Kitzbühel was the town to host the remenants of the Nazi made Serbian collaborationist government the Government of National Salvation from 1944 to the end of the war. Kitzbühel also had the good fortune to remain undamaged from the ravages of the First and Second World Wars.
Since the year 2000 the town has been a member of the Climate Alliance of Tyrol.

The town&#x27;s demographic evolution between 1869 and 2017 is shown in the list to the right.

==Sport ==
Kitzbühel is one of Europe’s best-known winter sports resorts, situated between the mountains Hahnenkamm adjacent to the southwest and to the northeast. The Hahnenkamm hosts the annual World Cup ski races, including the circuit&#x27;s most notable event, the Hahnenkamm Races on the notable Streif slope. Introduced in 1937, the northeast-facing &quot;Streif&quot; is among the world&#x27;s toughest downhill courses, if not the most, and is infamous for an abundance of spectacular crashes. In 1959 the Austrian Alpine Ski Championships took place from 27 February to 1 March.

Each summer Kitzbühel also hosts an ATP tennis tournament on clay, the Austrian Open.

From 2007 to 2011, ITU Triathlon World Cup races took place at the local &quot;Schwarzsee&quot; lake.

The &quot;Kitzbüheler Alpenrallye&quot; is an annual festival of historic automobiles, first held in 1988. The first trip of the &quot;United Buddy Bears&quot; was 2004 to Kitzbühel, following by the first trip into the &quot;big wide world&quot; – when they went to Hong Kong and many other metropolises on all five continents.

Since 2003, Kitzbühel has been hosting an annual Snow Polo event in January.

== Tourism ==

Together with the pistes and ski lifts in neighbouring Kirchberg in Tirol, Jochberg and by the Thurn Pass Kitzbühel is one of the largest ski regions in Austria. With around 10,000 hotel and guest house beds, Kitzbühel and its neighbours have an unusually high density of guest accommodation.

Holidaymakers in Kitzbühel have 56 cableway and lift facilities and 168 kilometres of slopes available to them, as well as 40 kilometres of groomed cross-country skiing tracks. Of note is the relatively new 3S Cable Car, the cable car with the highest above-ground span in the world.

In summer there are of mountain bike paths and of hiking trails.

Other attractions include six tennis courts and four golf courses, the Kitzbühel swimming pool, Austria&#x27;s only curling hall and the bathing lake of Schwarzsee.

Kitzbühel primarily caters for the high end of the tourist market, as many celebrities and the jet set come here, especially during the international races on the Hahnenkamm.

Together with eleven other towns Kitzbühel is a member of the community &quot;Best of the Alps&quot;. KitzSki, Kitzbühel&#x27;s main ski lift operator, has managed to defend the title of “World&#x27;s Best Ski Resort Company” for the seventh time in a row at the 2020 World Ski Awards.

==Music==
An International Polkafest was held in Kitzbühel in 1978.

== Transport ==
&quot;Road:&quot;

The Brixental Road, the B170, from Wörgl intersects in Kitzbühel with the Thurn Pass Road, the B161, from Mittersill to St. Johann in Tirol. Kitzbühel station is a major bus stop for buses to Lienz and Wörgl.

&quot;Rail:&quot;

Kitzbühel Hauptbahnhof, Kitzbühel Hahnenkamm and Kitzbühel Schwarzsee are stops on the Salzburg-Tyrol Railway.

Kitzbühel station has just been rebuilt (2010) and been equipped with new barrier-less platforms with underpasses and a lift. From 2011 there will be no stationmaster at Kitzbühel and it will no longer be possible to buy tickets at the counter.

<text>The morpho butterflies comprise many species of Neotropical butterfly under the genus Morpho. This genus includes more than 29 accepted species and 147 accepted subspecies, found mostly in South America, Mexico, and Central America. &quot;Morpho&quot; wingspans range from for &quot;M. rhodopteron&quot; to for &quot;M. hecuba&quot;, the imposing sunset morpho. The name &quot;morpho&quot;, meaning &quot;changed&quot; or &quot;modified&quot;, is also an epithet.
Blue morphos are severely threatened by the deforestation of tropical forests and habitat fragmentation. Humans provide a direct threat to this genus because their beauty attracts artists and collectors from all over the globe who wish to capture and display them. Aside from humans, birds like the jacamar and flycatcher are the adult butterfly’s natural predators.

== Taxonomy and nomenclature ==
Many names attach to the genus &quot;Morpho&quot;. The genus has also been divided into subgenera. Hundreds of form, variety, and aberration names are used among &quot;Morpho&quot; species and subspecies. One lepidopterist includes all such species within a single genus, and synonymized many names in a limited number of species. Two other lepidopterists use a phylogenetic analysis with different nomenclature. Other authorities accept many more species.

=== Etymology ===
The genus name &quot;Morpho&quot; comes from an Ancient Greek epithet , roughly &quot;the shapely one&quot;, for Aphrodite, goddess of love and beauty.

== Coloration ==

Many morpho butterflies are colored in metallic, shimmering shades of blues and greens. These colors are not a result of pigmentation, but are an example of iridescence through structural coloration. Specifically, the microscopic scales covering the morpho&#x27;s wings reflect incident light repeatedly at successive layers, leading to interference effects that depend on both wavelength and angle of incidence/observance. Thus, the colors appear to vary with viewing angle, but they are surprisingly uniform, perhaps due to the tetrahedral (diamond-like) structural arrangement of the scales or diffraction from overlying cell layers. The wide-angle blue reflection property can be explained by exploring the nanostructures in the scales of the morpho butterfly wings. These optically active structures integrate three design principles leading to the wide-angle reflection: Christmas tree-like shaped ridges, alternating lamellae layers (or &quot;branches&quot;), and a small height offset between neighboring ridges. The reflection spectrum is found to be broad (about 90 nm) for alternating layers and can be controlled by varying the design pattern. The Christmas tree-like pattern helps to reduce the directionality of the reflectance by creating an impedance matching for blue wavelengths. In addition, the height offset between neighboring ridges increases the intensity of reflection for a wide range of angles. This structure may be likened to a photonic crystal. The lamellate structure of their wing scales has been studied as a model in the development of biomimetic fabrics, dye-free paints, and anticounterfeit technology used in currency.

The iridescent lamellae are only present on the dorsal sides of their wings, leaving the ventral sides brown.

The ventral side is decorated with ocelli (eyespots). In some species, such as &quot;M. godarti&quot;, the dorsal lamellae are so thin that ventral ocelli can peek through. While not all morphos have iridescent coloration, they all have ocelli. In most species, only the males are colorful, supporting the theory that the coloration is used for intrasexual communication between males. The lamellae reflect up to 70% of light falling on them, including any ultraviolet. The eyes of morpho butterflies are thought to be highly sensitive to UV light, so the males are able to see each other from great distances. Some South American species are reportedly visible to the human eye up to one kilometer away.

Also, a number of other species exist which are tawny orange or dark brown (for instance &quot;M. hecuba&quot; and &quot;M. telemachus&quot;). Some species are white, principal among these being &quot;M. catenarius&quot; and &quot;M. laertes&quot;. An unusual species, fundamentally white in coloration, but which exhibits a stunning pearlescent purple and teal iridescence when viewed at certain angles, is the rare &quot;M. sulkowskyi&quot;. Some Andean species are small and delicate (&quot;M. lympharis&quot;). Among the metallic blue &quot;Morpho&quot; species, &quot;M. rhetenor&quot; stands out as the most iridescent of all, with &quot;M. cypris&quot; a close second. Indeed, &quot;M. cypris&quot; is notable in that specimens mounted in entomological collections exhibit color differences across the wings if they are not &#x27;set&#x27; perfectly flat. Many species, like &quot;M. cypris&quot; and &quot;M. rhetenor helena&quot; have a white stripe pattern on their colored blue wings as well.

Celebrated author and lepidopterist Vladimir Nabokov described their appearance as &quot;shimmering light-blue mirrors&quot;.

=== Sexual dimorphism ===
The blue morpho species exhibit sexual dimorphism. In some species (for instance &quot;M.adonis&quot;, &quot;M. eugenia&quot;, &quot;M. aega&quot;, &quot;M. cypris&quot;, and &quot;M. rhetenor&quot;), only the males are iridescent blue; the females are disruptively colored brown and yellow. In other species (for instance &quot;M. anaxibia&quot;, &quot;M. godarti&quot;, &quot;M. didius&quot;, &quot;M. amathonte&quot;, and &quot;M. deidamia&quot;), the females are partially iridescent, but less blue than the males.

==Habitat==
&quot;Morpho&quot; butterflies inhabit the primary forests of the Amazon and Atlantic. They also adapted to breed in a wide variety of other forested habitats – for instance, the dry deciduous woodlands of Nicaragua and secondary forests.
&quot;Morphos&quot; are found at altitudes between sea level and about .

== Biology ==
*&quot;Morpho&quot;s are diurnal, as males spend the mornings patrolling along the courses of forest streams and rivers. They are territorial and chase any rivals. &quot;Morpho&quot;s typically live alone, excluding in the mating season.
*The genus &quot;Morpho&quot; is palatable, but some species (such as &quot;M. amathonte&quot;) are very strong fliers; birds—even species which are specialized for catching butterflies on the wing—find it very hard to catch them. The conspicuous blue coloration shared by most &quot;Morpho&quot; species may be a case of Müllerian mimicry, or may be &#x27;pursuit aposematism&#x27;.
*The eyespots on the undersides of the wings of both males and females may be a form of automimicry in which a spot on the body of an animal resembles an eye of a different animal to deceive potential predator or prey species, to draw a predator&#x27;s attention away from the most vulnerable body parts, or to appear as an inedible or even dangerous animal.
*Predators include royal flycatchers, jacamars and other insectivorous birds, frogs, and lizards.

== Behavior ==
&quot;Morpho&quot;s have a very distinctive, slow, bouncy flight pattern due to the wing area being enormous relative to the body size.

== Life cycle ==
The entire life cycle of the morpho butterfly, from egg to death, is about 115 days.

The larvae hatch from pale-green, dewdrop-like eggs. The caterpillars have reddish-brown bodies with bright lime-green or yellow patches on their backs. Its hairs are irritating to human skin, and when disturbed it secretes a fluid that smells like rancid butter from eversible glands on the thorax. The strong odor is a defense against predators. They feed on a variety of plants. The caterpillar molts five times before entering the pupal stage. The bulbous chrysalis is pale green or jade green and emits a repulsive, ultrasonic sound when touched. It is suspended from a stem or leaf of the food plant.

The adults live for about two to three weeks. They feed on the fluids of fermenting fruit, decomposing animals, tree sap, fungi, and nutrient-rich mud. They are poisonous to predators due to toxins they sequestered from plants on which they fed as caterpillars.

The more common blue morphos are reared &quot;en masse&quot; in commercial breeding programs. The iridescent wings are used in the manufacture of jewelry and as inlay in woodworking. Papered specimens are sold with the abdomen removed to prevent its oily contents from staining the wings. Significant numbers of live specimens are exported as pupae from several Neotropical countries for exhibition in butterfly houses. Unfortunately, due to their irregular flight pattern and size, their wings are frequently damaged when in captivity.

== Host plants ==
&quot;Morpho&quot; larvae, variously according to species and region, feed on Leguminosae, Gramineae, Canellaceae, Guttiferae, Erythroxylaceae, Myrtaceae, Moraceae, Lauraceae, Sapindaceae, Rhamnaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Musaceae, Palmae, Menispermaceae, Tiliaceae, Bignoniaceae, and Menispermaceae.

According to Penz and DeVries the ancestral diet of larval Satyrinae is Poaceae or other monocots. Many morphos have switched to dicots on several occasions during their evolutionary history, but basal species have retained the monocot diets.

== Collectors ==
Morpho butterflies, often very expensive, have always been prized by extremely wealthy collectors. Famous collections include those of the London jeweler Dru Drury and the Dutch merchant Pieter Teyler van der Hulst, the Paris diplomat Georges Rousseau-Decelle, the financier Walter Rothschild, the Romanov Grand Duke Nicholas Mikhailovich of Russia and the, English and German respectively, businessmen James John Joicey and Curt Eisner. In earlier years, &quot;Morphos&quot; graced cabinets of curiosities &quot;Kunstkamera&quot; and royal cabinets of natural history notably those of Tsar of Russia Peter the Great, the Austrian empress Maria Theresa and Ulrika Eleonora, Queen of Sweden. More famous is Maria Sibylla Merian, who was not wealthy.

The people along the Rio Negro in Brazil once exploited the territorial habits of the blue morpho (&quot;M. menelaus&quot;) by luring them into clearings with bright blue decoys. The collected butterfly wings were used as embellishment for ceremonial masks. Adult morpho butterflies feed on the juices of fermenting fruit with which they may also be lured. The butterflies wobble in flight and are easy to catch.

<text>A no-fly zone, also known as a no-flight zone (NFZ), or air exclusion zone (AEZ), is a territory or area established by a military power over which certain aircraft are not permitted to fly. Such zones are usually set up in an enemy power&#x27;s territory during a conflict for humanitarian or military reasons without consent of the enemy state, similar in concept to an aerial demilitarized zone, and usually intend to prohibit the enemy&#x27;s military aircraft from operating in the region. Military action is employed by the enforcing state and, depending on the terms of the NFZ, may include preemptive attacks to prevent potential violations, reactive force targeted at violating aircraft, or surveillance with no use of force. Air exclusion zones and anti-aircraft defences are sometimes set up in a civilian context, for example to protect sensitive locations, or events such as the 2012 London Olympic Games, against terrorist air attack. A no-fly zone is generally not considered a form of aerial blockade due to its more limited scope compared to an aerial blockade. 

No-fly zones are a modern phenomenon established in the 1990s. They can be distinguished from traditional air power missions by their coercive appropriation of another nation&#x27;s airspace only, to achieve aims on the ground within the target nation. While the Royal Air Force (RAF) conducted prototypical air control operations over various contentious colonies between the two World Wars, no-fly zones did not assume their modern form until the end of the Gulf War in 1991.

During the Cold War, the risk of local conflict escalating into nuclear showdown made military intervention as a tool of United States statecraft unappealing. Furthermore, air power was a relatively blunt instrument until the operational maturation of stealth and precision-strike technologies. Before the Gulf War of 1991, it had not been possible to perform nuanced attacks against transitory, difficult-to-reach targets, and air power thus lacked the ability to produce decisive political effects short of total war. However, the demise of the Soviet Union and technological advances in aerospace capabilities made no-fly zones viable in both political and military contexts.

Enforcement of a no-fly zone is subject to the rules of armed conflict under international humanitarian law.

==Past no-fly zones==
===Iraq, 1991–2003===
Following the 1991 Gulf War, the United States along with other Coalition nations established two no-fly zones in Iraq. US and Coalition officials stated that the northern no-fly zone was intended to prevent attacks against the Kurdish people by the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein, and that the southern no-fly-zone was intended to protect Iraq&#x27;s Shia population. On 16 March 1988, the Iraqi Air Force deployed chemical weapons against Kurdish civilians during the Halabja chemical attack, killing roughly 5,000. This air-to-ground event served as part of the motivation used by Coalition Forces in order to extend and expand the NFZs, as well as citing parts of Article 42 within the U.N. Charter. The southern no-fly zone originally extended to the 32nd parallel, but was extended to the 33rd parallel in 1996. By 1999, over 1,800 bombs had reportedly been dropped on Iraq.

==== Legal status ====
This military action was not authorised by the United Nations. The Secretary-General of the United Nations at the time the resolution was passed, Boutros Boutros-Ghali called the no-fly zones &quot;illegal&quot; in a February 2003 interview with John Pilger for ZNet. In 1998, France withdrew from the operation, with French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine saying that &quot;there is no basis in international law for this type of bombing&quot;.

==== Civilian deaths ====
The United Nations reported that in 1999 alone, 144 civilians had been killed during Coalition bombing efforts. An internal UN Security Sector report found that, in one five-month period, 41% of the victims were civilians.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina, 1993–1995===

In 1992, the United Nations Security Council passed United Nations Security Council Resolution 781, prohibiting unauthorized military flights in Bosnian airspace. This led to Operation Sky Monitor, where NATO monitored violations of the no-fly zone but did not take action against violators of the resolution. In response to 500 documented violations by 1993, including one combat violation, the Security Council passed Resolution 816, which prohibited all unauthorized flights and allowed all UN member states to &quot;take all necessary measures ... to ensure compliance with [the no-fly zone restrictions].&quot; This led to Operation Deny Flight, during which the Banja Luka incident, the shooting down of at least four of a flight of six Serbian jets, occurred; the engagement was not only the first combat engagement of the operation, but also the first combat engagement in the history of NATO. NATO later launched air strikes during Operation Deny Flight and during Operation Deliberate Force. As many as 400 NATO aircraft participated in the air campaign.

===Libya, 2011===

As part of the 2011 military intervention in Libya, the United Nations Security Council approved a no-fly zone on 17 March 2011. The resolution includes provisions for further actions to prevent attacks on civilian targets. On 24 March, NATO agreed to take control of the no-fly zone. Shortly thereafter, several NATO members proceeded to mount an aerial offensive campaign, in which numerous Libyan government positions would be intentionally bombed. Some NATO members did not contribute or did little to participate in the air campaign, leading to public criticism from US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. The NATO no fly zone was terminated on 27 October after a unanimous vote by the UNSC, despite requests made by the Libyan National Transitional Council for its mission to be extended to the end of the year.

=== Libya, 2018 and 2019 ===
A no-fly zone was declared by the Tobruk-based LNA over the country&#x27;s south during its offensive in the region in 2018. It was later re-implemented for 10 days in 2019 as the LNA established control over oil fields in the region. The LNA declared another no-fly zone across the country&#x27;s west during the 2019 Western Libya offensive.

== Discussion of a no-fly zone over Ukraine, 2022 ==
Shortly after the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the Ukrainian leadership repeatedly urged NATO to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine, but the alliance rejected the request on account of risking further escalation and direct military confrontation with Russia. There were also questions over the effectiveness of implementing such a zone for the purpose of protecting the Ukrainian settlements, which have been subject to heavy and indiscriminate attacks from Russian artillery and other largely ground-based forces. On 18 March, the Russian-backed separatist government of the Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic claimed that Russia would establish a no-fly zone over the Donbas region of Ukraine.

== Analysis ==
A 2004 Stanford University paper published in the &quot;Journal of Strategic Studies&quot;, &quot;Lessons from Iraq and Bosnia on the Theory and Practice of No-fly Zones&quot;, reviewed the effectiveness of the air-based campaigns in achieving military objectives. The paper&#x27;s findings were: First, a clear, unified command structure is essential. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, during Operation Deny Flight, a confusing dual-key coordination structure provided inadequate authority and resulted in air forces not being given authority to assist in key situations; Second, to avoid a &quot;perpetual patrol problem&quot;, states must know in advance their policy objectives and the exit strategy for no-fly zones; Third, that the effectiveness of no-fly zones is highly dependent on regional support. A lack of support from Turkey for the 1996 Iraq no-fly zone ultimately constrained the coalition&#x27;s ability to enforce it.

<text>Wanzhou District () is Chongqing&#x27;s second most populated urban core area on the upper reaches of the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River in China. It is currently governed as a district of Chongqing Municipality, bordering Sichuan to the northwest and Hubei to the southeast. It was formerly known as Wanxian or Wan County (). Prior to Chongqing&#x27;s formation as a direct-controlled municipality, Wanzhou was part of Sichuan province. The urban core of Wanzhou is away from Chongqing&#x27;s city proper.

The characters for &quot;Wanzhou&quot; mean &quot;myriad-prefecture&quot;; which is derived from the phrase &quot;the place where myriad rivers converge and myriad traders gather&quot; (). Due to the construction of the Three Gorges Dam, 47% of Wanzhou&#x27;s old urban area was submerged and had to be relocated.

==History==

The district was part of Wanxian Prefecture (), then the prefectural Wanxian City (). It was renamed to Wanzhou in late 1990s.

It was part of Quren County of Ba Commandery () in the Qin dynasty. It became Yangqu County () in 216 (the Eastern Han dynasty). In 230 (the Shu-Han Kingdom), it was renamed to Nanpu (); in 553 (the Western Wei dynasty), to Yuquan (); in 557 (Northern Zhou dynasty), to Anxiang (); in 584, to Wanchuan (); and in 598 (Sui dynasty), to Nanpu again.

In 619 (Tang dynasty), Nanpu Commandery () was established. In 625, the name was changed to Pu Prefecture (), and in 634, to Wan Prefecture (). In 1373 (Yuan dynasty), Wan was demoted to a county ().

In the 19th century, it was known in English as Wanhsien and Wan County. In 1935, it became Wanxian Prefecture (). On 12 December 1992, the State Council abolished Wanxian Prefecture and its subordinate Wanxian City and created the prefecture-level Wanxian City, which administered the districts of Longbao (), Tiancheng (), Wuqiao () and the counties of Kai, Zhong, Liangping, Yunyang, Fengjie, Wushan, Wuxi, and Chengkou.

The entire Wanxian City was merged into Chongqing on 20 December 1997. The merge necessitated the abolishment of Wanxian City and creation of Wanxian District and Wanxian Migration Development Area (). Wanxian City&#x27;s three districts were converted to administrative committees (, abbreviated ) of Wanxian District. The migration development area included the counties formerly in Wanxian City, except Liangping and Chengkou, which were administered by Chongqing directly.

On 22 May 1998, the State Council approved that the two areas named Wanxian were both renamed to Wanzhou. The migration development area later dissolved and its counties were directly controlled by Chongqing. On 19 July 2000, the district&#x27;s administrative committees were changed to migration development areas.

==History==
According to the district&#x27;s government, the area comprising contemporary Fuling District has been inhabited since approximately 3000 BCE.

During the Spring and Autumn period, the area was inhabited by the . From the middle and late part of Spring and Autumn period, through to the middle of the Warring States period, the area belonged to the State of Ba. The area was at some point the site of one of the Ba&#x27;s capitals, and a Ba king is buried within the area. During the middle and latter part of the Warring States period, the area belonged to the State of Chu.

Following the State of Chu, the area was incorporated into the Qin dynasty as the . The area reorganized in 227 BCE, under the rule of King Zhaoxiang of Qin, as .

During the Eastern Han, Zhi County was merged into .

In the Three Kingdoms period, the area was ruled by the Shu Han, and organized as Hanping County (). Hanping County was subordinate to the , whose capital was located in present-day in the nearby Pengshui Miao and Tujia Autonomous County, to the southeast of Fuling District.

In 347 CE, under the Eastern Jin, the area was again reorganized as Fu Commandery (), which was also known as Zhicheng Commandery ().

The area&#x27;s administrative divisions were reorganized dramatically during the Northern and Southern dynasties.

The Sui dynasty would reorganize the area into three counties: Fuling County (), which belonged to the Ba Commandery, Fengdu County (), which belonged to the , and Dianjiang County (), which belonged to the .

In 618 CE, during the Tang dynasty, the area was reorganized as , which governed , Fuling County, and .

Under the Northern Song, Longhua County was changed to . During the Southern Song, Fu Zhou was reestablished to govern the area, and administered Fuling County and Wulong County.

Fu Zhou remained intact during the Yuan dynasty and the Ming dynasty, and governed Wulong County. Fu Zhou would continue intact during the Qing dynasty, but was not divided into counties. During this time, Fu Zhou was under the jurisdiction of .

In 1913, shortly after the establishment of the Republic of China, Fu Zhou was reorganized as Fuling County. Fuling County initially fell under the jurisdiction of , then directly under the jurisdiction of Sichuan , and finally under the Eight Administrative Inspectorate of Sichuan.

Following the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the area saw administrative reforms in early 1950. Fuling County was reorganized as , under the jurisdiction of . Fuling Area governed seven counties: Fuling, Nanchuan, Fengdu, Shizhu, Wulong, Changshou and Pengshui.

In 1988, Qianjiang, Youyang, Xiushan, Pengshui, and Shizhu counties were transferred to the jurisdiction of the newly-organized . Nanchuan County was re-designated as a county-level city in 1994. On November 5, 1995, the State Council passed legislation to abolish the county-level city of Fuling and replace it with two districts: Zhicheng District () and Lidu District ().

According to Peter Hessler, as of 1998, most residents of Fuling are genetically incapable of being alcoholics. When imbibing large amounts of alcohol many people became so sick and they could not drink heavily all the time. Therefore, according to Hessler, consumption of alcohol was not habitual but instead was a ritual, and therefore drinking patterns were &quot;abusive with light consequences.&quot;

<doc id="416569" wikidata="Q1260142" url="?curid=416569" title="Dromineer">
<text>Dromineer () is a small village and townland in County Tipperary, Ireland. It is on the shores of Lough Derg, 8 km north-west of Nenagh (10 km by road) on the R495 road. It is also a civil parish in the historical barony of Ormond Lower. Historic documents describe the places as &quot;Dromynnyre&quot;; the earliest form of the name dating from 1302 was Dromynwyr.

==Features==
Home to an ivy-clad ruined 13th-century Kennedy tower house, public harbour and other facilities, it is a destination for some tourists, including those interested in boating on the lake. The name Dromineer in Irish is &quot;Drom Inbhir&quot;, meaning the back of the ford of the river.

Amenities in Dromineer include a pub with a restaurant, holiday accommodation, a café, a children&#x27;s playground, a public marina, a private marina and boating clubs.

Dromineer is home to the Lough Derg Lifeboat, which is the RNLI&#x27;s third inland lifeboat station and was the first inland station in the Republic of Ireland. During 2013 the Lough Derg Lifeboat launched 20 times and rescued 33 people.

==Buildings of note==
In addition to the O&#x27;Kennedy towerhouse (ruined), structures listed as being protected by Tipperary County Council in the area include Dromineer Quay and Canal store. Both of these date from around 1845 (RPS Refs S568 and S569).

Two corrugated iron roofed houses summer houses from the 1920s overlook the lake (RPS Refs S571 and S572).

==Dromineer Castle (tower house)==
This castle/towerhouse began as a two storey 13th-century hall house and was later converted into a tower house in the 15th/16th century. It was built by the followers of Thomas Butler Esq. in the 13th century. The hall house was originally only two storeys high, but two additional storeys were later added, and vaults added to the ground floor. A base batter is present and can be attributed to the earlier structure. The conversion to a castle/towerhouse has resulted in a rectangular shape to the castle which is 11×15 metres. By 1299, the Cantwell family were tenants, with Thomas Cantwell paying taxes on the castle.

The building then fell into Gaelic hands, and the Ormond O’Kennedys were responsible for the remodelling of the building into a tower house. Many of the windows were modified during the conversion from hall to tower house. 

In 1582 the Butler Earls of Ormond re-captured the castle/towerhouse, and the Cantwells returned as tenants until c. 1640. 

In the Civil Survey of 1654–56 the castle was described as the &quot;Mannor of Dromineer &amp;c appertaineth a Courte Leete &amp; Courte Barron with all the Rights privileges &amp; immunities belonging to a mannor. Uppon the sd lands stands an old castle, six thatch houses, and fowerteene cottages.&quot; The proprietor of the castle in 1640 was John Cantwell, of Cantwells Court, in Kilkenny. 

In 1650, the castle was seized by Cromwellian forces and garrisoned. It was returned the Earl of Ormond following the occupation by Cromwell. It was occupied until 1688. The castle/towerhouse fell into ruin in the late 17th century and was sold by the Earl of Ormond in the late 19th century.

A bawn wall also surrounds the castle in places. Many of the large quadrangular windows are 17th-century features.

==Dromineer Church==
This church may have been built in the 10th century. The tradition states that the monks from Holy Island built it.

It is located in the parish of Puckane &amp; Carrig, which consists of a total of 71 townlands and is 18,310 statute acres or approximately 28.6 square miles in extent. The parish has a number of sites that have Early Christian religious associations, including Dromineer. Folklore recalls four places in the parish where Mass was secretly celebrated during the Penal Days.

The parish was traditionally known as ‘Monsea’, ‘Monsea &amp; Kilodiernan’ or ‘Monsea &amp; Cloughprior’. These names reflect its origins because the present parish is an amalgamation of five medieval parishes, Cloughprior, Dromineer, Kilodiernan, Knigh and Monsea. The ruined churches at Dromineer were built in the Romanesque style, while those at Cloughprior, Knigh and Monsea were built in the Gothic style of the fifteenth century. The graveyards surrounding those churches are still used for burials and Mass is celebrated in each annually.

Church construction employed exceptionally large blocks of stone. It was extended in 12th century in the Celtic Romanesque style. The west doorway was still standing in the 1830s when John O&#x27;Donovan was here. Carvings include dogs&#x27; heads with bulging eyes. The church is located in the graveyard adjoining the public house.

==Sport and recreation==
The local GAA club is Kildangan GAA. Fishing is also a popular activity in the area, both on the lake and the nearby Nenagh River.

Boating in Dromineer is served by both public and private marinas. The area is home to Nenagh Boat Club, Shannon Sailing Club and the Lough Derg Yacht Club which is the twenty third-oldest yacht club in the world, and seventh oldest in Ireland having been founded in 1835 and one of two remaining yacht clubs with a fleet of Shannon-One-Design sailing dinghies, the North Shannon Yacht Club having folded.

Dromineer is on one of the North Tipperary Cycle Routes. The 65 km route starts at Banba Square, Nenagh and is listed as a half-day cycle.

The Lough Derg Way is a long-distance walking trail between Limerick City and Dromineer. It is designated as a National Waymarked Trail by the National Trails Office of the Irish Sports Council and is managed by Shannon Development, Tipperary County Council and Tipperary Integrated Development Company. The trail was reconfigured and relaunched in 2011 with many sections taken off-road aided by an investment of €115,000 under the Comhairle na Tuaithe Walks Scheme, which supports landowners to maintain trails that cross their land. The trail connects with the East Clare Way at Killaoe. &quot;Sli Eala&quot; (&quot;The Way of the Swan&quot; in Irish) is a public walkway between Nenagh and Dromineer. For much of its length it follows the Nenagh River where mute swans can be seen. The route passes Annaghbeg bridge and Ballyartella Mills on its way upstream, a spur off the main route leads to Ballycommon.

<text>Caddo Lake () is a lake and bayou (wetland) on the border between Texas and Louisiana, in northern Harrison County and southern Marion County in Texas and western Caddo Parish in Louisiana. The lake is named after the Caddoans or Caddo, Native Americans who lived in the area until their expulsion by the United States in the 19th century. The US forced most of them to move west to Indian Territory.

The lake and bayou comprise an internationally protected wetland under the Ramsar Convention and includes one of the largest flooded cypress forests in the United States. Caddo is one of Texas&#x27;s few non-oxbow natural lakes. It was artificially altered by the addition of a dam in the 1900s.

== Formation ==

According to Caddo legend, the lake was formed by the 1811–12 New Madrid earthquakes. There may be some truth to the legend, as Reelfoot Lake in Tennessee has been documented as formed by that earthquake.

But most geologists believe that the lake was formed earlier, either gradually or catastrophically, by the &quot;Great Raft&quot;, a log jam on the Red River in Louisiana. This likely caused flooding of the existing low-lying basin. According to a 1913-1914 survey that dated timber there, the lake formed about 1770 to 1780.

== History ==

Caddo Lake has been used by Native Americans for hundreds of years, but substantial commercial development would only begin with invention of the steamboat and US annexation of Louisiana and Texas by treaty (Texas is the only State in the United States to have joined by treaty instead of annexation) in the 19th century. The cities of Port Caddo, Swanson&#x27;s Landing, and Jefferson in Texas, and Mooringsport in Louisiana, had thriving riverboat ports on the lake. Jefferson was the largest inland port in the United States during this period.

Gradually as the log jams were removed in the lake and on the Red River by Captain Henry Miller Shreve and then by the Army Corps of Engineers, the lake changed shape and eventually its water level dropped by more than . This dramatically reduced navigability by riverboat and ended the success of the East Texas ports.

A different industry came to Caddo Lake in the early 20th century with the discovery of oil beneath it. The world&#x27;s first over-water oil platform was completed in Caddo Lake in 1911. The &quot;Ferry Lake No. 1&quot; was erected by Gulf Refining Company. The well bottomed at and produced .

Oil derricks were erected throughout the lake, further damaging the fragile ecosystem. The oil industry left Caddo for richer fields at Kilgore and other locations in Texas. Texas tried to preserve parts of Caddo in 1934 by establishing a 483-acre (2 km2) state park, with trails, cabins, and other facilities constructed by the WPA.

The Longhorn Army Ammunition Plant was built on the shores of Caddo in the mid-20th century, and its operations polluted large portions of the surrounding wetlands until its closure in the 1990s. Most of the former plant site is now a federal wildlife refuge.

In 1913 and 1914, ecologist Lionel Janes conducted a federal survey of Caddo Lake (called Ferry Lake at the time) for the Department of Interior. Based on an examination of cross sections of bald cypress and hardwood trees, and many dead stumps, he estimated that the lake formed sometime between 1770 and 1780.
==Wildlife==
Wildlife inhabiting Caddo Lake includes owls, snakes, frogs, waterfowl, bobcats, river otters, beavers, eagles, and alligators.

== Preservation efforts ==
In 1993 Caddo Lake preservation efforts were expanded. The Nature Conservancy had purchased of the Caddo Lake area and announced an agreement to merge this property with the Texas Caddo State Park, creating the Caddo Lake State Park and Wildlife Management Area. As a result of efforts by the Caddo Lake Institute (co-founded by Don Henley and Dwight K. Shellman), in October 1993 Caddo Lake became one of thirteen areas in the United States protected by the Ramsar Convention. This is an international effort to protect important wetlands for sustainability. Among supporters advocating preservation of Caddo Lake has been rocker Don Henley, singer and songwriter for The Eagles.

As of 2003, Caddo Lake flora and fauna consisted of 189 species of trees and shrubs, 75 grasses, 42 woody vines, 216 kinds of birds, 90 fish and reptiles, and 47 mammals. The Crataegus opaca, known as the mayhaw, produces fruit that people use to make jelly. Forty-four of Caddo&#x27;s native species were either endangered, threatened or rare.

From 2001 until 2003 Caddo Lake residents fought a legal battle with the City of Marshall, Texas over water rights.

== Current threat ==
The lake is &quot;under siege&quot; by a fast-spreading, Velcro-like aquatic fern, &quot;Salvinia molesta&quot;, also known as Giant Salvinia. Accidentally introduced to the lake by boaters, the noxious weed doubles in size every two to four days, rapidly killing off life below the surface. Most of the growth of the plant is on the Louisiana side. Officials have been focused on recovering from damage caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005.

Efforts at removing the weed have included biological means via beetles that normally eat the weed, but these were unable to survive the Texas cold. Herbicide is also being used against the invasive fern. The Texas Water Resource Institute&#x27;s Caddo Lake Salvinia Eradication Project is evaluating multiple methods of eradication.

== Texas Bigfoot ==
Since 1965 Texas&#x27;s Caddo Lake has been the center of hundreds of alleged Bigfoot sightings, according to the North American Wood Ape Conservancy (NAWAC). This was reported in the Travel Channel 2006 documentary &quot;Bigfoot&quot;.

<text>Douglas Kent Bereuter (born October 6, 1939) is an American retired politician from the state of Nebraska in the Midwestern United States. He served as a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from 1979 until 2004. He also served as the president and CEO of The Asia Foundation from 2004 to 2011 and is a member of the ReFormers Caucus at Issue One. Bereuter is a member of the Republican Party.

==Early life and education==
Bereuter, a fifth generation Nebraskan, was born in York, Nebraska, and was reared in Utica, Nebraska, attended its Lutheran and public schools before graduating from Utica High School in 1957. He attended the University of Nebraska in Lincoln, where he was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, with election to Phi Beta Kappa, and Sigma Xi, before graduating in 1961 with a B.A. and as a Distinguished Military Graduate. He attended the Harvard Graduate School of Design from 1961 to 1963, receiving its M.C.P. degree. From 1963 to 1965 he served as a counter-intelligence officer in the U.S. Army, with the 1st Infantry Division. After intervening public and private sector employment, from 1972 to 1973 he attended Harvard&#x27;s Kennedy School of Government, receiving the M.P.A. degree.

==Career==
Bereuter worked as an urban planner with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development from 1965 to 1966. He was a division director for the Nebraska Department of Economic Development from 1967 to 1968, and from 1968 to 1970 he was director of the Nebraska Office of Planning &amp; Programming and the State&#x27;s Federal-State Relations Coordinator. After the 1970 election defeat of Nebraska&#x27;s Republican governor, Norbert T. Tiemann, Bereuter worked as an independent city and regional planning consultant in the Great Plains and Rocky Mountain West and as a part-time associate professor in the graduate planning programs of both Kansas State University and the University of Nebraska. After his congressional service, Doug Bereuter was active in public service as a long term board member of the Arbor Day Foundation and the Nebraska Community Foundation, on supporting food security and agricultural development in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia with the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, where he is a Distinguished Fellow, and for seven years as a member of the State Department&#x27;s International Security Advisory Board. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Affairs and the World Affairs Council of Northern California.

==Political career==

After defeating an incumbent state senator in his home district, Bereuter served in the Nebraska Legislature from 1975 to 1979. He was a member of the Nebraska Legislature&#x27;s appropriations committee. As a Republican congressional candidate in the 1978 General Election, Bereuter received 58.13% of the vote and was elected to serve Nebraska&#x27;s 1st Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives. He was subsequently re-elected 12 times, never winning less than 59% of the vote. His 26 years in the House was the longest for a Nebraska congressman, exceeded only by the combined House and Senate service of both George W. Norris and Carl Curtis. He announced that he would not seek re-election for a 14th term, and retired from the U.S. House of Representatives on August 31, 2004, to immediately become the president and CEO of The Asia Foundation, where he served until retirement at the beginning of 2011.

After his initial assignments on the House Interior &amp; Insular Affairs Committee and the Small Business Committee, Bereuter served 22 years on both the House Foreign Affairs and Banking or Financial Services Committees. As a leading member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, he served as its vice chairman and as chairman of its Asia-Pacific and Europe Subcommittees. He also served on the Economic Policy &amp; Trade and Human Rights Subcommittees of the Foreign Affairs Committee.  On the Banking Committee, he served for 16 years as chairman or ranking minority member of its International Financial Institutions Subcommittee. Bereuter also served a total of nearly 10 years on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, retiring as its vice chairman. Additionally, Bereuter served his last three terms on the Transportation &amp; Infrastructure Committee; and he served on the House Select Committee on Hunger for the entire period of its existence.

Some of Bereuter&#x27;s additional congressional responsibilities included service as a congressional delegate to the United Nation&#x27;s 42nd General Assembly, as the founding co-chairman of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, and as Chairman of the Speaker&#x27;s Task Force to Monitor and Report on the Transition Hong Kong (1996–2002). Additionally, he served on the U.S. Presidential Commission on Security and Economic Assistance (1983–1984) and on the U.S. Presidential Commission on Agricultural Trade and Export Policy (1985–1986). Bereuter also chaired the House delegation to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly for ten years, retiring after two years as its president.  For his work on European and NATO expansion issues, he was the recipient of decorations from the governments of Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Romania. He also had leadership roles in parliamentary exchanges with the European Parliament, Japan, Korea, China, and the United Kingdom.

Among the bills that Bereuter authored was the Bunning-Bereuter-Blumenauer Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2004. He also was co-author of the Bereuter-Levin Amendment, which made possible the passage of the act granting Permanent Normal Trading Relations with China. He was also responsible for starting the USAID Farmer-to-Farmer technical assistance program, which has taken thousands of American volunteers abroad. At the end of his congressional service, that program was named for him, along with a Farmers Home Administration program he authored to provide a home loan guarantee program for residents of small communities.

Bereuter generally had a moderate voting record. His lifetime American Conservative Union rating was 63. His speech at a Nebraska Republican Party meeting in 1998 underscored his moderate political approach and drew national attention when he urged the party to adopt a big tent policy by welcoming membership to people of any religious background through its practices and policies. In 2004, Bereuter endorsed state Senator Curt Bromm, Speaker of the Nebraska Legislature, as his successor in the U.S. House of Representatives. From a field of seven Republican candidates in Nebraska&#x27;s Primary Election, Senator Bromm came in second behind Jeff Fortenberry after the Club for Growth made a large, last minute campaign contribution to defeat him. Shortly before he left Congress, Bereuter released a statement calling the Iraq War, which he had previously supported, &quot;a mistake,&quot; and strongly criticized a &quot;massive failure&quot; of pre-war intelligence.
