<text>Henryk Grossman (; pen name Grossmann; 14 April 1881 – 24 November 1950) was a Polish economist, historian, and Marxist revolutionary active in both Poland and Germany.

Grossman&#x27;s key contribution to political-economic theory was his book, &quot;The Law of Accumulation and Breakdown of the Capitalist System&quot;, a study in Marxian crisis theory. It was published in Leipzig months before the Stock Market Crash of 1929.

==Early life and education==
Grossman was born as Chaskel Grossman into a relatively prosperous Polish-Jewish family in Kraków, Poland (then part of Austrian Poland). Although his parents were assimilated into Krakow society, they nevertheless ensured their sons were circumcised and registered as members of the Jewish community. His father died at the age of 54 when Henryk was 15.

He joined the socialist movement around 1898, becoming a member of the Social Democratic Party of Galicia (GPSD), an affiliate of the Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party of Austria. The GPSD, led by Ignacy Daszyński, was formally Marxist, but dominated by Polish nationalists close to the Polish Socialist Party (PPS). When the Ukrainian Social Democratic Party in Galicia (USPD) was formed in 1899, the GSPD became the Polish Social Democratic Party (PPSD) and the Polish nationalist current was strengthened. Grossman led the resistance of orthodox Marxists to this current. Along with Karl Radek, he was active in the socialist student movement, particularly in &quot;Ruch&quot; (Movement), which included members of the PPSD as well as of the two socialist parties in the Kingdom of Poland, the PPS and the Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania (SDKPiL – led by Rosa Luxemburg and Leo Jogiches). He was the main figure in the newspaper &quot;Zjednoczenie&quot; (Unification), which took a line close to the SDKPiL, against the pro-PPS politics of &quot;Ruch&quot;s main organ, &quot;Promień&quot; for which he was censured by the PPSD and its newspaper &quot;Naprzód&quot;.

During this period, Grossman learned Yiddish and became involved in the Jewish workers&#x27; movement in Kraków. Grossman was the founding secretary and theoretician of the Jewish Social Democratic Party of Galicia (JSDP) in 1905. The JSDP broke with the PPSD over the latter&#x27;s belief that the Jewish workers should assimilate to Polish culture. It took a position close to the Bund, and was critical of the labour Zionism of the Poale Zion as well to assimilationist forms of socialism. The JSDP sought to affiliate to the Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party of Austria (the General Party), but this was refused. However, the JSDP was active alongside the General Party, for example for universal suffrage.

Grossman earned his Juris Doctor in 1908 from the Jagiellonian University. At the end of 1908, he went to the University of Vienna to study with the Marxian economic historian Carl Grünberg, withdrawing from his leadership role in the JSDP (although he remained on its executive until 1911 and had contact with the small JSDP group in Vienna, the Ferdinand Lassalle Club). With the destruction of the Austro-Hungarian empire at the end of World War I, Grossman became an economist in Poland, and joined the Communist Party of Poland.

==Career==
From 1922 to 1925, Grossman was Professor of economics at the Free Polish University in Warsaw. He emigrated in 1925 to escape political persecution. The same year he was invited to join the Marxian Institute for Social Research in Frankfurt by his former tutor Carl Grünberg.

Hitler&#x27;s accession to power in 1933 forced him first to Paris, and then via Britain to New York, where he remained in relative isolation from 1937 until 1949. In that year he took up a professorship in political economy at the University of Leipzig in East Germany.

Grossman&#x27;s &quot;The Law of Accumulation and Breakdown of the Capitalist System&quot;(1929) despite being one of the first publications of the Frankfurt School was only made available in English translation in 1979 by Jairus Banaji, for an Indian Trotskyist organisation, the Platform Tendency. A recent edition is: . However, it is a condensed version and lacks the important concluding chapter of the German original.

==Contribution to theory==
While at Frankfurt in the mid-1920s, Grossman contended that a &quot;general tendency to cling to the results&quot; of Karl Marx&#x27;s theory in ignorance of the subtleties of &quot;the method underlying &quot;Capital&quot;&quot; was causing a catastrophic vulgarisation of Marxian thought, a trend which was undermining the revolutionary possibilities of the moment.

&quot;The Law of Accumulation&quot; was his attempt to demonstrate that Marxian political economy had been underestimated by its critics and by extension that revolutionary critiques of capitalism were still valid. Amongst other arguments, it sets forth the following demonstration (for a complete definition of the terms employed, the whole book is recommended):

===Logical and mathematical basis of the law of breakdown===
Apart from the arithmetical and logical proofs that we have been given already, mathematicians may prefer the following more general form of presentation which avoids the purely arbitrary values of a concrete numerical example.

; Meaning of the symbols
&quot; c &quot; = constant capital. Initial value = &quot;co&quot;. Value after &quot;j&quot; years = &quot;cj&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot; v &quot; = variable capital. Initial value = &quot;vo&quot;. Value after &quot;j&quot; years = &quot;vj&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot; s &quot; = rate of surplus value (written as a percentage of &quot;v&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
&quot; ac &quot; = rate of accumulation of constant capital &quot;c&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot; av &quot; = rate of accumulation of variable capital &quot;v&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot; k &quot; = consumption share of capitalists&lt;br&gt;
&quot; S &quot; = mass of surplus value, being:

formula_1

&quot; Ω &quot; = organic composition of capital, or &quot;c&quot;:&quot;v&quot;&lt;br&gt;
(Correction with respect to Grossman&#x27;s text: From the formula below it follows that Grossman means by &quot; Ω &quot; the initial value of the organic composition of capital &quot;formula_2&quot;:&quot;formula_3&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
&quot; j &quot; = number of years

Further, let &lt;br&gt;
formula_4

and let &lt;br&gt;
formula_5

===Formula===
After &quot;j&quot; years at the assumed rate of accumulation &quot;ac&quot;, the constant capital &quot;c&quot; reaches the level:
formula_6

At the assumed rate of accumulation &quot;av&quot;, the variable capital &quot;v&quot; reaches the level:
formula_7

The year after (&quot;j&quot; + 1) accumulation is continued as usual according to the formula:
formula_8

whence

formula_9

For &quot;k&quot; to be greater than 0, it is necessary that:
formula_10

&quot;k&quot; = 0 for a year &quot;n&quot;, if:
formula_11

Note this line follows the German original in &quot;Das Akkumulations- und Zusammenbruchsgesetz des kapitalistischen Systems (zugleich eine Krisentheorie)&quot; because it is misspecified in the condensed English translation.

The timing of the absolute crisis is given by the point at which the consumption share of the entrepreneur vanishes completely, long after it has already started to decline. This means:

formula_12

whence &quot;n&quot; =
formula_13

This is a real number as long as &quot;s &gt; av&quot;

However, this is what we assume anyway throughout our investigation. Starting from time-point &quot;n&quot;, the mass of surplus value &quot;S&quot; is not sufficient to ensure the valorisation of &quot;c&quot; and &quot;v&quot; under the conditions postulated.

===Discussion of the formula===
The number of years &quot;n&quot; down to the absolute crisis thus depends on four conditions:
# The level of organic composition &quot;Ω&quot;. The higher this is the smaller the number of years. The crisis is accelerated.
# The rate of accumulation of the constant capital &quot;ac&quot;, which works in the same direction as the level of the organic composition of capital.
# The rate of accumulation of the variable capital &quot;av&quot;, which can work in either direction, sharpening the crisis or defusing it, and whose impact is therefore ambivalent.
# The level of the rate of surplus value &quot;s&quot;, which has a defusing impact; that is, the greater is &quot;s&quot;, the greater is the number of years &quot;n&quot;, so that the breakdown tendency is postponed.

The accumulation process could be continued if the earlier assumptions were modified:
# The rate of accumulation of the constant capital &quot;ac&quot; is reduced and the tempo of accumulation slowed down.
# The constant capital is devalued which again reduces the rate of accumulation &quot;ac&quot;.
# Labour power is devalued, hence wages cut, so that the rate of accumulation of variable capital &quot;av&quot; is reduced and the rate of surplus value &quot;s&quot; is enhanced.
# Finally, capital is exported, so that again the rate of accumulation &quot;ac&quot; is reduced.

These four major cases allow us to deduce all the variations that are actually to be found in reality and which impart to the capitalist mode of production a certain elasticity ...

Much of the remainder of Grossman&#x27;s book is devoted to exploring these &quot;elasticities&quot; or counter-crisis tendencies, tracking both their logical and their actual, historical development. Examples of each would include:
# Depressed interest rates, investment capital transferred to unproductive speculation, e.g. housing stock, art objects.
# Enlarged state sector bleeds value from the accumulation process via taxes. Wars destroy capital values.
# The reserve army of labour (unemployed) created to discipline wage claims.
# Imperialism

== Personal life ==
Grossman lost his immediate family in the Holocaust. His wife Jana and his son Jan were murdered in Auschwitz in 1943. His return to Leipzig was considered in the newly formed German Democratic Republic to be a success for the regime, and he was nominated by the city of Leipzig in March 1950 for the National Prize &#x27;for the totality of his scientific achievements in the area of scientific socialism&#x27;, but did not win. He was plagued with ill health and died after suffering with prostate problems and Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

<text>CA Technologies, Inc., formerly Computer Associates International, Inc., and CA, Inc., was an American multinational enterprise software developer and publisher that existed from 1976 to 2018. CA grew to rank as one of the largest independent software corporations in the world, and at one point was the second largest. The company created systems software (and for a while applications software) that ran in IBM mainframe, distributed computing, virtual machine, and cloud computing environments.

The company&#x27;s primary founder was Charles Wang. The main key to Computer Associates&#x27; fast growth was the acquisition of many lesser-sized software companies in the IBM mainframe industry segment. CA was known for large-scale dismissals of employees in the acquired firms, and for sometimes extracting cash flow from acquired products rather than enhancing them. Customers of CA often criticized the company for its poor technical support and hostile attitude. CA underwent a major accounting scandal in the early 2000s that led to several past executives being sent to prison. However by the 2010s, several industry organizations ranked CA highly in corporate responsibility and recognition metrics.

Computer Associates had its origins in both Switzerland (Zurich and Geneva) and in the United States (New York City). It was headquartered on Long Island for most of its history, at first Jericho and Garden City in Nassau County, then Suffolk County for two decades in Islandia before moving back to Manhattan in 2014. In 2018, the company was acquired by Broadcom Inc., a semiconductor manufacturer, for nearly $19 billion.

==History==
===Origins===
The origins of Computer Associates International lie in a Swiss software products company and a New York data services company.

Samuel W. Goodner was a Texan who was working for the American businessman Sam Wyly&#x27;s company, University Computing Company (UCC). UCC had acquired the Swiss computer services company Automation Center A.G., founded by the Swiss businessman Walter Haefner, and Wyly despatched Goodner to Europe to watch over it. By 1970, UCC was experiencing financial difficulties, and Goodner, who admired some of Haefner&#x27;s management practices, decided to leave and start his own firm that would engage in software product development. A company by the name of Computer Associates A.G. was founded in 1970 by Goodner and was located in Zurich, Switzerland.

Meanwhile, under regulatory pressure in 1969, IBM had announced its decision to unbundle the sale of computer hardware from its software and support services, i.e., mainframe computers from computer programs, etc. The decision opened new markets to competition and provided an opportunity for entrepreneurs to enter the nascent software industry  — an opportunity that Goodner sought to exploit by developing and selling software products for the IBM mainframe market.

The new firm Computer Associates was underfinanced, but it did have a customer in the Swiss pharmaceutical giant Hoffmann-La Roche and it had developed a sorting program for Hoffmann-La Roche. The new sort had superior efficiency, and, starting in 1971, Computer Associates began selling in Europe the CA-SORT package as a plug-in replacement for the IBM Sort on IBM System/360 and System/370 mainframe platforms. The firm sought to sell in countries other than Switzerland, and created a holding company for that purpose; distributors were signed up in different European countries, some of which would then be acquired by Computer Associates. As of 1971, Computer Associates International SA was described as being based in Geneva, and Geneva would be its headquarters through the rest of the 1970s. Then in mid-1974, CA-SORT began being distributed and sold in the United States by Pansophic Systems, under the name Pansort. By 1974, the firm was referred to as Computer Associates International Ltd.

In New York City, Standard Data Corporation was a company that was mainly in the service bureau business for electronic data processing. One of the first such companies, it had been in existence since 1959, and was located at 1540 Broadway in Manhattan. In 1973, Standard Data began offering the SYMBUG product for sale, which was a symbolic debugger for the COBOL programming language on the IBM mainframe VM/370 platform. In addition, by October 1974, Standard Data was advertising several other products for VM/CMS, including VM/370 ISAM, an emulation of OS ISAM in VM/CMS, as well as SYMBUG for other languages. Eventually Standard Data created a Software Products Division, of which Charles B. Wang was a vice-president. Wang too sought to take advantage of the IBM unbundling decision by developing and marketing software products for the IBM mainframe.

In January 1976, an agreement was signed whereby Pansophic Systems relinquished U.S. rights to CA-SORT and Standard Data Corporation took those exclusive rights over and in the so doing, restored the product name to its European form. Standard Data also gained U.S. rights to a report generator package called EARL (for Easy Access Report Language).

===1970s===
Then in October 1976, a merger was announced between Computer Associates International Ltd and the Software Products Division of Standard Data Corporation, with this merger creating a new entity, Computer Associates, Inc., with Wang as president. The newly created company would continue to market CA-SORT in the United States and in the rest of the Western hemisphere, while the existing European firm would market some of Standard Data&#x27;s products such as SYMBUG. The new company had an office at 655 Madison Avenue. (The main part of Standard Data Corporation continued on as a company, supplying computer services for several kinds of organizations; the company persisted into the 2010s, but its website does not appear to have been accessible after 2018.)

It is thus to 1976 that the creation of what would become the well-known Computer Associates company is usually dated. This new venture began with four employees. One of them was Russell Artzt, who had met Wang in college, worked with him at Standard Data Corporation, was responsible for programming some of the early software products the new company was offering. Artzt is accordingly considered a co-founder of the well-known Computer Associates.

But that would still be awaiting. Soon, the new American venture&#x27;s name would appear as Trans-American Computer Associates, Inc., in the sense that by September 1977, the company&#x27;s advertisements were copyrighted to Trans-American Computer Associates, Inc., while CA-SORT 77 was copyrighted to Computer Associates International Ltd. For instance, DYNAM/D was a disk utility for IBM mainframes running DOS and DOS/VS that did disk space management, disk cataloguing, and other such functions; announced in 1977, its trademark belonged to Trans-American Computer Associates, indicating it was developed in America rather than Europe.
In 1979, offices of the American company were moved to Long Island at Jericho, New York, at 125 Jericho Turnpike.

By 1980, the overall Computer Associates International had some 300 employees across its locations around the globe and was selling 12 different products to what it said were 9,000 different customer installation sites. Sales from the United States were the biggest market for the company. In 1980, Wang bought out the Swiss parent company and Computer Associates International, Inc. became his.

===1980s===

Computer Associates had an IPO in 1981 that garnered the company a modest $3.2 million. Its stock traded on the NASDAQ using the stock symbol &quot;CASI&quot;.

The first significant acquisition in CA&#x27;s history took place in 1982, when it merged with Capex Corporation, resulting in a 50 percent increase in CA&#x27;s revenues. Both CA and Capex made software products for the IBM mainframe, but while by CA&#x27;s own marketing statements CA had visibility and success in software products for IBM&#x27;s DOS mainframe operating system, potential customers did not think CA was strong in products for the IBM OS mainframe operating system. In contrast, this was an area where Capex had established itself.

The acquisition of Capex was generally viewed as having been successful. It was the start of what was to become a buying spree for Computer Associates over the next several years. The company specialized in going after third-party mainframe software.
By 1986, Computer Associates had moved its headquarters again, to Garden City. They would come to be situated in five other buildings within Nassau County as well.

CA&#x27;s strategy for growth reached a new level with its deal for Uccel in 1987, which valued at $800 million was an order of magnitude larger than any of its previous acquisitions. Uccel was a new name for UCC, which Haefner had gained control of from Wyly in 1976 and which had undergone ups and downs in the years since. Of Uccel&#x27;s existing staff of 1,200 people, 550 were let go; this kind of harsh post-acquisition reduction measure was typical for the company and became a part of CA&#x27;s public image. Haefner became Computer Associates&#x27; largest individual shareholder, with a stake that comprised about 25 percent of the company.

In 1987, CA&#x27;s stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange using the ticker symbol &quot;CA&quot;. In 1988, the company purchased the principal software product of Consco.

As the decade ended, CA became the first software company after Microsoft to exceed $1 billion in sales. 
&quot;Information Week&quot; listed Computer Associates ahead of Microsoft in a 1990 roundup titled &quot;Software&#x27;s Heavy Hitters.&quot;

===1990s===
Early in the decade, Computer Associates was forced to address criticism of the company as well as a sharp decline in its stock price, which fell more than 50 percent during 1990. The ensuing changes included pushing into foreign markets (Japan, Canada, Africa, Latin America), reforming how the company charged its customers for software maintenance, and improving compatibility with products from other vendors, such as Hewlett-Packard (HP), Apple Computer, and Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). In addition, the company was not immune to the effects of the early 1990s recession, and by October 1991 the stock was down by around 70 percent from its earlier peak in May 1989. At this point, CA had some 7,000 employees, and around $1.4 billion in sales,

In 1991, CA acquired Pansophic Systems.

After 2½ years of planning and construction, the company began moving its headquarters to Islandia, New York in Suffolk County in 1992, consolidating all of the Nassau County operations. There it would occupy a large corporate campus with three office buildings. By this juncture, CA was Long Island&#x27;s second largest private employer, after Grumman Aerospace, and Suffolk County politicians had given CA substantial tax abatements and assistance with construction financing to lure the company there.

In 1994, CA acquired the ASK Group and continued to offer the Ingres database management system under a variety of brand names.

In 1992, the company was sued by Electronic Data Systems (EDS), a CA customer. EDS accused CA of breach of contract, misuse of copyright and violations of antitrust laws. CA filed a counterclaim, also alleging breach of contract, including copyright infringement and misappropriation of trade secrets. The companies reached a settlement in 1996.

In 1995, Legent Corporation was acquired for $1.78 billion, the biggest-ever acquisition in the software industry at that time, and Cheyenne Software for $1.2 billion in 1996. CA executed the software industry&#x27;s then-largest acquisition ($3.5 billion) via Platinum Technology International in 1999.

In 1998, an unsuccessful and hostile takeover bid by CA for computer consulting firm Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) prompted a bribery suit by CSC&#x27;s chairman Van Honeycutt against CA&#x27;s founder and then CEO, Charles Wang.

By the end of the 1990s, Computer Associates was the dominant company among providers of utility software tools for the mainframe. Personal computer software firms such as Microsoft, Lotus Software, and WordPerfect Corporation were much more recognizable as names to the general public. but while this mainframe industry segment was not widely known, it was a renumeratively rewarding one. A profile in &quot;Business Week&quot; in 1996 was headlined &quot;Computer Associates: Sexy? No. Profitable? You Bet &quot;, and that accurately conveyed the company&#x27;s place in the industry.

In May 1998 stock grants were issued to Wang and two others together worth $1.1 billion at the time.
In 1999, Wang received the largest bonus in history at that time from a public company. The receipt of a $670 million stock grant that dated to the vesting of a 1995 stock option occurred while the company faced a slowdown in European markets and an economic slump in Asia, both of which had affected CA&#x27;s earnings and stock price. The stock grants thus became quite controversial. In total, the company took a $675 million after-tax charge for $1.1 billion in payouts to Wang and other top CA executives.

===Company culture===
Computer Associates received poor marks for customer relations, with a reputation of being more interested in making sales than providing support afterward. To some extent, the CA sales force regarded customers as foes. In 2001, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Computer Associates has infuriated clients with high prices and poor technical support.&quot; &quot;Fortune&quot; wrote, &quot;For all its ubiquity inside the tech departments of corporate America, CA had a horrendous reputation. Where Microsoft has long been the most feared software company, the old CA claimed the title of most despised – not by competitors but by its own customers.&quot;

Detractors of CA accused it of putting newly acquired software products into maintenance mode and milking them for cash flow. The products themselves were expensive and central to what corporate IT departments were doing, and so customers found it difficult to move away from CA. As &quot;Fortune&quot; wrote, &quot;These products made it the barnacle of corporate America: Once you had CA software onboard, it was so onerous and expensive to pull it out that few customers ever did. That led to a lot of steady cash flow – and to arrogance on the part of CA&#x27;s management.&quot; Or as &quot;The Register&quot; wrote, &quot;CA used acquisitions to grow its portfolio... Along the way it acquired a reputation as the place decent software goes to die.&quot; Nonetheless, as the &quot;Times&quot; noted in 2001: &quot;To be sure, complaints about Computer Associates&#x27; prices and customer support have been around almost as long as the company, and it has always outlasted its detractors.&quot;

As some industry analysts observed, the culture of Computer Associates reflected Wang&#x27;s personality and background, that of an immigrant educated at the non-elite Queens College, City University of New York. Wang did not admire or belong to the Silicon Valley mindset and either insulted or avoided its ecosystem of industry analysts and venture capitalists. The company&#x27;s sales force was composed largely of people with blue-collar backgrounds from New York&#x27;s outer boroughs and Long Island. With them, CA had a reputation for being, as &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; wrote, &quot;smart, aggressive, and consistently profitable&quot;.

Internally, as the &quot;Times&quot; wrote, 
&quot;Over the years, [the company] has gained a reputation as a callous employer that dismisses workers without warning while top executives take home eight- and sometimes nine-figure pay packages.&quot;
In particular, Computer Associates had a reputation for mass dismissals within companies it had taken over. This was the case with Applied Data Research, for instance, as some 200 employees from its Montgomery Township, New Jersey facility were let go on a single morning in 1988. Similarly, at Cullinet, around 400 employees, comprising a quarter of the company&#x27;s workforce were told to clear out their desks on a day in 1989. As Sam Wyly, the head of Sterling Software, reflected upon his decision in 2000 to sell that company to Computer Associates: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t easy for us because of
our concern about the CA culture. It wasn&#x27;t the ideal end place for our products and people.
We agonized over that, but our overriding duty was to the shareholders, so we went ahead
with the deal.&quot;

A contrarian view of Computer Associates was given by computer industry historian Martin Campbell-Kelly, writing around 2001, who gave the company credit for continuing to enhance the DATACOM/DB and IDMS database products it had acquired and for doing the work to have its databases and utility products be able to interoperate. Campbell also saw the act of staffing reductions as &quot;rationalization&quot; of existing businesses that in some cases were not performing well. A hybrid characterization was given in 2002 by Pansophic Systems founder Joseph A. Piscopo, who said that while his company, acquired in 1991, had suffered the typical fate of CA reducing it to just the minimal staff needed to keep maintenance revenue going, in a few cases CA did actually invest in companies it acquired as part of an internal product development strategy, with Cheyenne Software being one such instance.

===Accounting scandal===

By 2000, Computer Associates had acquired on the order of magnitude of 200 companies. In that year, Sanjay Kumar replaced Wang as chief executive officer, with the latter remaining as chairman of Computer Associates&#x27; board of directors. Then in 2002, Wang departed completely and Kumar became chairman as well.

In 2000, a shareholder-based class-action lawsuit accused CA of misstating more than $500 million in revenue in its 1998 and 1999 fiscal years in order to artificially inflate its stock price. In 2001, a proxy battle ensued between the board of directors and shareholders led by Wyly, who was unhappy with how CA was being run and especially with how his acquired Sterling Software was being treated. Wyly was not trying to buy the company, but rather trying to get shareholders to elect a new board of directors that would include him as chair. Wyly had hopes of appealing to Haefner, as their business relationship dated back to the 1960s, but Haefner stayed loyal to Wang. In the end, Wyly&#x27;s two attempts failed; he gave up the struggle in 2002 and received a $10 million payment that was characterized as &quot;greenmail&quot; by some, but not all, industry analysts.

Meanwhile, by early 2002 it was public knowledge that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office for the Eastern District of New York had instantiated investigations as to whether CA had engaged in accounting fraud. CA had to cancel a plan to refinance its debt after Moody&#x27;s Investors Service indicated it might downgrade the company&#x27;s credit rating, an action that the service soon took. Later in 2002 the U.S. Department of Justice limited CA&#x27;s acquisitions.

The investigation by the SEC resulted in charges against the company and some of its former top executives. The SEC alleged that from 1998 to 2000, CA routinely kept its books open to include quarterly revenue from contracts executed after the quarter ended in order to meet Wall Street analysts&#x27; expectations. As one account from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania wrote, &quot;The SEC said the goal was to meet or beat per-share earnings estimates of Wall Street analysts, a key to keeping a company&#x27;s stock price rising. ... In all, the company prematurely reported $3.3 billion in revenues from 363 software contracts. ... Moreover, executives at Computer Associates were big shareholders themselves, and many held enormous blocks of stock options. They therefore had a big financial stake in the share price, and thus an incentive to inflate results.&quot;

Kumar resigned as CEO and chairman of the company in 2004, staying on as chief software architect, then two months later left the company completely. Following the change in executive leadership, the company restated its earnings for 2000 and 2001 due to the unaccepted revenues policies. Around the same time in 2004, the company avoided indictment for involvement in the 35 day month accounting scandal by reaching a settlement with the SEC and Department of Justice, in which CA agreed to pay $225 million in restitution to shareholders and reform its corporate governance and financial accounting controls.

Eight CA executives pleaded guilty to fraud or obstruction of justice charges, and several received prison terms. Most notably, in 2006 former CEO and chairman Kumar was sentenced to 12 years in prison and fined $8 million for his role in the massive accounting fraud at Computer Associates. The company subsequently made sweeping changes through virtually all of its senior leadership positions. Overall the company spent over $500 million on investigations and fines.

===2000s===
By 2001, Computer Associates was the fourth-biggest among independent software companies and had 18,000 employees. Attempts to diversify away from the mainframe business had not met with much success.

CA started the India Technology Centre in Hyderabad on December 10, 2003. In 2004, CA appointed ex-IBM employee John Swainson as CEO. Swainson tried to turn things around, but was hampered by trouble that the company had in fixing its internal finance and accounting systems.

During this time, the company presented its Enterprise IT Management (EITM) vision to unify and simplify enterprise-wide IT By 2006, the company had 15,000 employees.

The company&#x27;s original name of Computer Associates International, Inc. was changed to CA, Inc. in January 2006. The company said that the change reflected a changed focus towards helping customers &quot;simplify the management of enterprise-wide IT&quot;; it also came shortly before Kumar pleaded guilty to the array of charges against him.

From May 2008 on, CA was a Nasdaq-100 company.

On September 1, 2009, CA announced CEO John Swainson&#x27;s decision to retire by the end of the year.
On January 28, 2010, CA announced that William E. McCracken would be its chairman of the board and chief executive officer.

===2010s===
In May 2010, at the opening of the CA World 2010 conference in Las Vegas, the company announced it was changing its name again, to CA Technologies. For a reason, the company said the new name &quot;reflects the full breadth and depth of what the company offers.&quot;

In 2010, the company acquired eight companies to support its cloud computing strategy: 3Tera, Nimsoft, NetQoS, Oblicore, Cassatt, 4Base Technology, Arcot Systems, and Hyperformix. It also acquired Replay Solutions. In 2011, CA acquired ITKO for $330 million. Two years later, it acquired app deployment and management company Nolio for approximately $40 million, as well as Layer7.

The company had been a provider of anti-virus and Internet security commercial software programs for personal computers during its venture into the business-to-consumer market.
In 2011, CA sold its antivirus properties to Updata Partners, which spun the division off as Total Defense. After the spinoff, CA became primarily known again for its business-to-business mainframe and distributed (client/server, etc.) information technology infrastructure applications.

On January 7, 2013, CA Technologies announced that Michael P. Gregoire would be a member of the board and new chief executive officer. In June 2014, CA Technologies moved its headquarters, without an announcement, from Islandia in Suffolk County, to 520 Madison Avenue in New York City.

In 2015, the company made four acquisitions, including Rally software for $480 million, Unifyalm, Gridtools, Idmlogic, and Xceedium.

In 2016, CA acquired Blazemeter, Automic, Veracode, and Runscope in 2017.

CA Technologies posted $4.2 billion in revenue for fiscal year 2018 (ending March 31, 2018). Mainframe products and services was still the major of CA&#x27;s income, comprising about $2.2 billion in the fiscal year, while its so-called enterprise solutions market segment contributed some $1.75 billion and its services business around $0.3 billion. As of 2018, CA Technologies maintained offices in more than 40 countries and employed approximately 11,300 people.

On August 8, 2018, CEO Mike Gregoire was elected as chairman of CA Technologies board of directors, replacing retiring chairman Art Weinbach.

===Acquisition by Broadcom===

On July 11, 2018, Broadcom Inc. announced it would acquire CA Technologies for $18.9 billion in cash. 
CA&#x27;s head, Mike Gregoire, said, &quot;This combination aligns our expertise in software with Broadcom&#x27;s leadership in the semiconductor industry.&quot; The acquisition puzzled some industry observers, since the two companies&#x27; businesses seemed to have little in common. One analyst acknowledged that Broadcom could generate cash from the CA operations, but commented: &quot;Financially, it can make sense. But what&#x27;s the strategic logic?&quot; &quot;The Register&quot; termed it the &quot;Weirdest. Acquisition. Ever.&quot; The transaction was closed on November 5, 2018.

The irony of the reversal of positions did not go unnoticed, with &quot;The Register&quot; saying &quot;CA Technologies, long a byword for making acquisitions, has been acquired by Broadcom.&quot; And Broadcom, like CA, had a reputation for making large reductions in the companies it had just acquired. Immediately after the acquisition closed, Broadcom laid off former CA Technologies workers in Silicon Valley and Plano, Texas. It also laid off 262 former CA Technologies employees in Islandia and some in Manhattan. Then, Long Island-based &quot;Newsday&quot; reported that about 40 percent of all CA employees in the United States would be laid off, adding up to almost 2,000 people being let go. Not long after the Broadcom acquisition, the large Computer Associates campus in Islandia was abandoned.

== Corporate responsibility and recognition ==

During the mid-1990s, Computer Associates realized it had an image problem, both externally and internally, and consequently created a public relations department within the company and also adopted some more employee-friendly human resources policies.

=== Sustainability ===
In 2010, CA was listed among the greenest companies by Newsweek&#x27;s Green rankings. CA has been named a component of the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes (DJSI) for seven years, from 2012 to 2018. In 2015 and 2016, CA was ranked as one of America&#x27;s Greenest companies by Newsweek.

In 2017, the company scored an A− from CDP, the world&#x27;s most comprehensive rating of companies leading on environmental action, for environmental performance and disclosure.

According to a corporate sustainability report released by the company in 2018, CA reduced its Greenhouse Gas Footprint by more than 35 percent since 2006. It received the Climate Leadership Award in Excellence in GHG Management in 2018, and was included in Barron&#x27;s 100 Most Sustainable Companies in 2018 as well.

In February 2018, CA was named one of the World&#x27;s Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere Institute for the third consecutive year.

=== Equality and diversity ===
CA Technologies was named one of the best companies for multicultural women by Working Mother Magazine for four consecutive years, from 2015 to 2018 as well as one of the 100 Best Companies from 2015 to 2017. The company was also awarded 4.3 of 5 stars by InHerSight as one of the Top 10 IT Companies for Women in 2017. In 2015 and 2016, Fatherly.com ranked CA as one of the Best Places to Work for New Dads.

In 2018, CA was named a NAFE top company for executive women. CA was also included in the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI) in 2018.

In 2018, for the fourth consecutive year, the Human Rights Campaign Foundation ranked CA as one of the Best Places to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality.

CA CEO Mike Gregoire is a signatory of the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion pledge.

=== Work environments ===

For four consecutive years, 2015–2018, CA was named by Computerworld as one of the Best Places to Work in IT. In 2017, it was named to the Forbes list of America&#x27;s Best Employers and recognized with a STAR Award for Leadership and Innovation by the Technology Services Industry Association (TSIA).

In 2018, CA was named to the Thomson Reuters World&#x27;s Top 100 Technology companies and for six consecutive years has been the recipient of the NorthFace ScoreBoard Award from Customer Relationship Management Institute (CRMI).

==Acquisitions==

CA had a long history of acquisitions in the software industry. It grew its portfolio and became successful through acquiring many companies in disparate fields, including enterprise system monitoring and management, ID management, security, and anti-virus, among others.

<text>Charles Henry Stanley (September 2, 1819 – October 6, 1901) was the first chess champion of the United States. When the first U.S. championship match took place in 1845, Stanley defeated Eugène Rousseau of New Orleans, and claimed the title of U.S. Chess Champion.

==Chess career==
Stanley was an Englishman who emigrated from London to New York in 1843 to work in the British Consulate, and his English ideas had a great influence on American chess. Stanley is a little-known figure who has been eclipsed by the achievements of the world famous Paul Morphy.

Stanley defeated Eugène Rousseau of New Orleans in 1845 to claim the title as the first U.S. Chess Champion.

One of his ideas was to have a regular newspaper column devoted to chess, which he started in 1845 in &quot;The Spirit of the Times&quot;. He also started the &quot;American Chess Magazine&quot; in 1846, which together with &quot;The Chess Palladium and Mathematical Sphinx&quot; were the first American chess magazines. However, other magazines soon followed and competition forced them out of business. In 1846 he published the first US book on a chess match, &quot;31 Games of Chess&quot; and became secretary of the New York Chess Club. In 1855 Stanley organized the first World Problem Tournament. In 1849 he helped future chess master Johann Löwenthal, who was then a penniless immigrant.

He was one of the participants in the 1st American Chess Congress, which he played in 1857 where Morphy won, and he was regarded as the new U.S. Chess Champion. He had some matches against Benjamin Raphael, the results of which are unknown. After the 1st American Chess Congress he lost a match against Morphy in 1857.

In 1860 he returned to England, but in the years he was away, the standard of play had increased greatly and, failing to achieve any success he returned to the United States two years later.

==Personal life and death==
Stanley was born to John and Anna Stanley in England on September 2, 1819. He married Sarah Weir in 1850, and had a daughter, Pauline. 

His job at the British consulate in New York involved him in diplomatic incident in 1855. The British minister to the United States John F. Crampton had orders to surreptitiously recruit Americans as soldiers in the Crimean War. But the U.S. was neutral, and even friendly to the opposing side, Russia. Stanley was one of several operatives involved who spilled information after getting drunk, and the affair ended with Crampton (but not Stanley) being expelled by President Pierce. 

Morphy never accepted prize money for his wins, and sent the earnings from his 1857 match directly to Stanley&#x27;s wife, pregnant at the time. Stanley acknowledged the generosity by naming his daughter after Morphy, and publishing &quot;Morphy&#x27;s Match Games&quot;.

Stanley and his wife both died in 1901. He battled alcoholism his entire life, and spent his last twenty years institutionalized. He died at the Home for Incurables on October 6, 1901, and was buried at Green-Wood Cemetery.

Barcia was only known by his cadre name, Hardy, even to the majority of LO members.

Robert Barcia was born into a working-class family in Paris and was originally a member of the Communist Party. He began his activity as a militant in the Second World War. He then joined a tiny Trotskyist group, the Union Communiste, led by Barta (David Korner) a Romanian Trotskyist. Given that the group was clandestine, all members adopted cadre names and there was a considerable stress on security within the group. This continues today as does the emphasis of the UCI on orienting towards workers in the workplaces.

The UC did not take part in the regroupment of the other French Trotskyist groups which took place in 1944 and led to the foundation of the Internationalist Communist Party. This was because the UC held that the other Trotskyist groups had not made a balance sheet of what the UC saw as their nationalist deviations in the early period of the war.

The central task of the UC was working around the Renault factory in the Paris area, where it had members working and doing educational work in order to develop cadres. In 1947, this work meant that the UC was instrumental in leading the Renault strike which contributed to the fall of the Government. However, Hardy was not personally involved in these events due to ill health.

The strain on the UC leading the struggle at Renault and subsequently the independent SDR union there led to its collapse. After various attempts to revive the UC, a paper, &quot;Voix Ouvrière&quot;, was launched in 1956 after the Soviet invasion of Hungary and the Suez Crisis. Among the figures leading this effort were Hardy and another former member of the UC Pierre Bois the leading UC militant at Renault. An obscure dispute with Barta seems to have ensured his lack of involvement however.

From 1956, Hardy was the central leader of first Voix Ouvrière, and after 1968 Lutte Ouvrière, and stamped his character on the group. However, given that texts from VO and LO tend not to be signed by individuals and given also that Hardy has not run for public office his role in the organisation has been obscure.

The journalist Christophe Bourseiller published a book of conversations with Hardy in 2003. Following the announcement of Robert Barcia&#x27;s death, he said: &quot;There were two Hardys. There was Hardy the Trotskyist militant who ruled his comrades with great discipline and had dedicated his life to communism and to revolution. And there was Barcia, the private man, a likeable and knowledgeable man with a great sense of humour.&quot;

<text>The British Rail Class 55, also known as a Deltic, or English Electric [[List of British Rail power classifications#Type 5|Type 5]], is a class of diesel locomotive built in 1961 and 1962 by English Electric for British Railways. Twenty-two locomotives were built, designed for the high-speed express passenger services on the East Coast Main Line (ECML) between Edinburgh and . They gained the name &quot;Deltic&quot; from the prototype locomotive, DP1 &quot;Deltic&quot; (the running number DP1 was never carried), which in turn was named after its Napier Deltic power units. 

At the time of their introduction into service in 1961, the Class 55s were the most powerful single-unit diesel locomotives in the world, with a power output of . They had an official maximum speed of , and introduced the first regular 100 mph diesel passenger service to Britain, they were however capable of higher speeds than this, and often exceeded their official maximum in service, especially in their later years, with speeds of up to , being recorded on level gradients, and up to whilst descending Stoke Bank.

Despite their successes, the Deltics had a relatively short commercial service life of 20 years. From 1978 they were displaced by the next generation of high speed diesels, the &quot;InterCity 125&quot; High Speed Trains (HSTs) and the Deltics were subsequently relegated mostly to secondary services on the Kings Cross to York, Edinburgh and Hull routes, although they continued to operate some top-link trains until 1981, such as the &quot;Hull Executive&quot;. As a small non-standard fleet with high running costs, no viable alternative use could be found for the Deltics, and all were withdrawn from service between January 1980 and December 1981. Six of the locomotives were saved for preservation.

==Background==
In 1955, the English Electric company produced a prototype diesel locomotive at the Dick, Kerr &amp; Co works in Preston, officially named the DP1 but commonly known as &quot;Deltic&quot;. This prototype experimentally used two Napier Deltic engines which had been developed for marine applications. These unconventional engines were configured in a triangle with an opposed piston design. They ran at high speed (1,500 RPM) more than twice that of conventionally configured engines, which made them very powerful relative to their size and weight, compared to the conventional diesel engines of the era. The locomotive used two of these engines, both rated at , which gave the locomotive a combined power output of for a weight of 106 tons.

The other notable features of the locomotive were its large size by British standards and striking styling, which was inspired by the bulldog nosed American diesels of the era.

At the same time, the management of the British Railways Eastern Region were looking for a replacement for their pre-war fleet of Class A4 steam locomotives for use on top-link expresses on the East Coast Main Line. There was a contemporary (1957) proposal to electrify the ECML, however this had a proposed completion date of 1970. Gerry Fiennes, the traffic manager of the ECML, believed that his expresses should be able to achieve an end-to-end average speed of in order to remain competitive with other forms of transport, he felt that they could not wait more than a decade for service improvements by electrification when the expanding road network was taking away passengers, and opted instead for high speed-diesel traction as an interim solution.

The management of the Eastern Region were however unimpressed by the performance of the best conventional diesels of the time, the English Electric Type 4, which for a weight of 133 tons, produced , which meant that their performance was no better than the steam locomotives they were supposed to replace. However, as the &quot;Deltic&quot; prototype had the necessary power and speed to achieve Gerry Fiennes&#x27;s desired performance improvements, he persuaded British Railways to purchase a fleet of locomotives based on it.

== Production ==

In March 1958, an order was placed with English Electric for a production fleet of 22 locomotives (reduced from the 23 originally planned), replacing more than twice that number (55) of steam locomotives including 35 Nigel Gresley Pacifics; as steam locomotives require substantial time to clean, fuel, and fire, such a reduction in the number of units could be undertaken without a corresponding reduction in working availability. The full order was worth £3,410,000 (), working out at £155,000 (), per locomotive. Due to the complexity of the engine design, which needed specialist maintenance, the locomotives were purchased under a five year service contract, with English Electric agreeing to maintain them, including their engines and generators, for a fixed price; this was British Rail&#x27;s first such contract. Additional Deltic engines were produced to enable engines to be exchanged regularly for overhaul while keeping the locomotives in service. English Electric trained the British Rail staff at the Doncaster Works in the techniques of maintaining the engines, and after the contract ended, they took over this responsibility.

The production locomotives were built at the Vulcan Foundry at Newton-le-Willows; they were mechanically little changed from the prototype, but differed in appearance with a toned down styling, sporting a more sober colour scheme, and lacking the prototype&#x27;s large headlight. The production Deltics were also 7 tons lighter than the prototype, weighing in at 99 tons, despite being nearly longer. They were originally planned to be delivered within a year from March 1960, but this deadline was not met, and they were delayed by a year, with the first Deltic entering revenue service in the summer of 1961, with a full service being introduced the following year.

The locomotives were assigned to three locomotive depots: Finsbury Park in London, Gateshead near Newcastle, and Haymarket in Edinburgh. Very soon, all were named; the Gateshead and Edinburgh Haymarket locomotives after regiments of the British Army from the North-East of England and from Scotland, respectively, while Finsbury Park followed the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) tradition of naming locomotives after winning racehorses.

At the same time, English Electric built a further ten locomotives which were later classified as the , which had single Napier Deltic engines; these gained the nickname &quot;Baby Deltics&quot; as they were in effect scaled down versions of the Deltics. These locomotives however, were far less successful in service than their larger cousins, and were all withdrawn by 1971.

== British Rail service ==
The introduction of the Deltics was a step change in locomotive performance on the East Coast Main Line. Once the entire fleet was delivered into service in 1962, the timetable was accelerated, with the journey time from London to Edinburgh cut by one hour, from seven hours to six; this was enabled by the Deltics&#x27; ability to accelerate rapidly and maintain high speed with a heavy train over long distances. This matched the timing of the pre-war A4-hauled &quot;Coronation&quot; service, but was achieved without priority over other traffic unlike the earlier LNER train; it was also now the timing of normal standard fare expresses throughout the day, and not just a once-a-day premium fare express. 

From 1966 the infrastructure on the ECML was progressively upgraded to allow higher speeds in order to take better advantage of the Deltics&#x27; capabilities; this included upgrading the track, and other improvements such as the easing of sharp curves and improving the alignments through various stations. By 1973, these upgrades had allowed another half-hour to be cut from the London–Edinburgh journey time, with the Deltic-hauled &quot;Flying Scotsman&quot;, timetabled to reach Edinburgh in 5 ½ hours, with one stop at , achieving an average speed of over the entire journey.

On one of O. S. Nock&#x27;s first Deltic runs (the down &quot;Heart of Midlothian&quot; loaded to 13 coaches, 530 tons gross) he stated &quot;once the tail of the train was over the 60 mph restriction the throttle was opened to the full, and the surge forward could be felt in the cab. Never previously had I felt a positive thrust in my back when in the second man&#x27;s seat!&quot; Nock went on to estimate that at 80 mph the locomotive was producing about 2,750 drawbar horsepower.

As early as 1963, Deltics were recorded exceeding 100 mph, Nock recording 100 mph for 16 miles south of Thirsk with a maximum of ; he went on to say that such speeds in 1963 were &quot;terrific&quot;.

The ultimate Deltic performance came on 2 February 1978 with a run on the 07:25 from Newcastle to King&#x27;s Cross. In some respects, the run was set up (the driver was about to retire) but the speeds were record-breaking. The locomotive was 55 008 &quot;The Green Howards&quot;; it was hauling 10 coaches (343 tons gross), and on the leg from York to London it achieved a timing of 137 min 15 sec. This included various signal stops and other enforced speed reductions; the net time is estimated at 115 min 45sec, an average of start to stop. The train achieved on the flat between Darlington and York, at Offord and whilst descending Stoke Bank.
From 1978, the ECML was upgraded to allow 125 mph running, in order to accommodate the InterCity 125s, and although the Deltics were still officially limited to 100 mph, in practice they frequently exceeded this in service. 

The fastest regular scheduled Deltic service was the &quot;Hull Executive&quot; between London and , which was inaugurated in May 1978. The down (northbound) working of this service achieved an average speed of from King&#x27;s Cross to its first stop at , making it the fastest regular locomotive-hauled train in Britain at the time. Maintaining this schedule required sustained periods of running above 100 mph. The published logs of some of these runs show that Deltics cruised at up to . The &quot;Hull Executive&quot; was one of the last top-link workings by a Deltic, until 1981, when this service was taken over by HST&#x27;s.

The Railway Performance Society estimate that on modern infrastructure (the Selby Diversion etc.) a realistic Deltic-hauled schedule from King&#x27;s Cross to Edinburgh would be around 4 hours 57 minutes (a theoretical unchecked run being around 4 hours 40 minutes). This would be for a train of 11 coaches and include a stop at Newcastle, the latter city being reached in a scheduled 3 hours 6 minutes.

The Deltics had arrived from the manufacturer painted in two-tone green, the dark BR green on top, with a narrower strip of a lighter, lime green along the bottom. This helped to disguise the bulk of the locomotive body. The cab window surrounds were picked out in cream-white. Although delivered without it, they all soon sported the bright yellow warning panel at each end common to all British diesel and electric locomotives, to make them more conspicuous. By 1966 the InterCity branding was introduced, and the Deltics began to be painted in corporate Rail Blue with yellow ends, the change generally coinciding with a works repair and the fitting of air brake equipment, the locomotives originally having only vacuum braking (the first so treated was D9002; the last to be painted blue was D9014). In the early 1970s they were fitted with Electric Train Heating (ETH) equipment to power Mark 2 air-conditioned coaches, while a couple of years later, with the introduction of BR&#x27;s TOPS computer system, they were renumbered 55 001 to 55 022.

=== Withdrawal ===

In the late 1970s, the Deltics began to take on secondary roles, gradually being supplanted by the next generation of express passenger services, namely the &quot;InterCity 125&quot; High Speed Train (HST) which were introduced on the ECML from 1978. At this time, British Rail had a general policy of not maintaining small non-standard fleets of locomotives, and when the HST fleet took over East Coast mainline services, it was obvious the class had a limited future. Various alternative uses for the fleet were examined, but this came to nothing: A significant weakness of the Deltics were their high running costs, due to the complexity of their engine design which required expensive specialist maintenance, which mitigated against their redeployment elsewhere. In their last years, the Deltics mostly operated the semi-fast services between London and York. They were also used on various popular excursions to areas of the country often far outside of their usual operating area, such as Exeter, and .

During 1980 and 1981, the fleet was gradually run down; no new spare parts were ordered for the declining fleet, and the locomotives were gradually withdrawn, and then cannibalised for spares to keep the others running. Withdrawn locomotives were taken to Doncaster for stripping and eventual scrapping. For a time the Deltic scrap line was a major draw for railway enthusiasts. In November 1981, the Doncaster Works dismantled its Deltic engine overhaul facility.

The National Railway Museum selected 55 002 &quot;The King&#x27;s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry&quot; for preservation as part of the National Collection. The Friends of the National Railway Museum sponsored the repaint of 55 002 into original green livery for its last eighteen months in traffic, although it carried its TOPS number rather than D9002. As insurance, in case 55 002 should meet with a mishap during its last months, the withdrawn 55 005 &quot;The Prince of Wales&#x27;s Own Regiment of Yorkshire&quot; was set aside from breaking up at Doncaster Works until Deltic operation on the main line had concluded.

The final service train run was the 16:30 Aberdeen–York service on 31 December 1981, hauled from Edinburgh by 55 019 &quot;Royal Highland Fusilier&quot;, arriving in York at just before midnight. The last train was an enthusiast special, the &quot;Deltic Scotsman Farewell&quot;, on 2 January 1982, hauled from King&#x27;s Cross to Edinburgh by 55 015 &quot;Tulyar&quot; and 55 022 &quot;Royal Scots Grey&quot; on the return. 55 009 &quot;Alycidon&quot; shadowed the train in both directions between Peterborough and Newcastle, in case of a failure of the train locomotive. Following the farewell, the surviving Deltics were moved to Doncaster Works, where they were displayed en masse in February 1982, before disposal commenced.

===Accidents and incidents===
*On 15 December 1961, locomotive D9012 &quot;Crepello&quot; was hauling an empty stock train when it ran into the rear of a goods train at Conington, Huntingdonshire during permissive block working. Another goods train then ran into the wreckage, followed a few minutes later by a third goods train.
* On 5 March 1967, locomotive No. 9004 &quot;Queen″s Own Highlander&quot; was hauling a passenger train that overran a signal and was derailed at Conington. Five people were killed and eighteen injured. The signalman had moved a set of points under the train. He was convicted of endangering persons travelling on the railway but was acquitted of manslaughter. He was sentenced to two years&#x27; imprisonment.
* On 7 May 1969, locomotive No. 9011 &quot;The Royal Northumberland Fusiliers&quot; was hauling the &quot;Aberdonian&quot; which derailed at , Northumberland due to excessive speed on a curve, although 9011 itself remained on the rails. Six people were killed and 46 were injured.
*On 16 February 1977, an express passenger train hauled by 55 008 collided with a Class 101 diesel multiple unit operating an empty stock train after failing to stop at . The guard of the express was slightly injured. The cause of the accident was that the brakes on the carriages had become isolated, in a freak event, whilst the train was moving. The train had struck an object on the track, which had caused a traction motor cover to come loose. This struck the handle of the brake isolating cock, closing it and thus separating the brakes between the locomotive and train. Following the collision, the train was diverted onto the Tees Valley line, where it was brought to a halt by the operation of the communication cord in one of the carriages.

== Preservation ==

Six locomotives survive; all have run in preservation and all have operated on the mainline, although 55 015 only ran on the mainline at the Rocket 150 event in 1980. Two cabs are also preserved.

Current loco numbers are indicated in bold.

=== Loco details ===
* D9000 (55 022) &quot;Royal Scots Grey&quot; was purchased by the Deltic 9000 Fund and, on 7 September 1983, was handed over in fully running condition after work and a repaint by BR. Its first base was the Nene Valley Railway. It was later accommodated by Network SouthEast at Selhurst and Old Oak Common depots, from where it regularly travelled to open days around the country. In 1996 it was overhauled by Railcare at St. Rollox railway works, Glasgow and received main-line certification. The Deltic 9000 Fund became a limited company (Deltic 9000 Locomotives Limited) and both D9000 and D9016 passed into its care. Its initial return to service, on the &quot;Deltic Deliverance&quot; charter, on 30 November 1996, was cut short by an exhaust stack fire (a regular Deltic problem in service days). Following rectification work at Springburn it ran to King&#x27;s Cross on an empty stock train before resuming its second main-line career on 2 January 1997 on the &quot;Deltic Reunion&quot; charter to Hull and Harrogate, during which it visited the turntable within the National Railway Museum, where it stood alongside the prototype. It continued to work main line charter trains between 1997 and 2002 and was hired by both Anglia Railways and Virgin CrossCountry to operate service trains on their behalf, as cover for their locomotives.&lt;br&gt;Following the demise of Deltic 9000 Locomotives Limited in 2004 the locomotive was sold to Beaver Sports (Yorks) Ltd. It completed an 18-month overhaul and was re-certified for running on the main line in August 2006. &quot;Royal Scots Grey&quot; has been repainted into blue livery, carrying the markings of York (YK depot) and York City coat of arms crests above the numbers, as done in 1981. It is the first Class 55 to carry the York coat of arms crest since 1982. The locomotive continues to work charters and to be available for spot hire to national operators. In 2015 the locomotive was repainted with &#x27;Finsbury Park-style&#x27; white cab window surrounds and at various times has carried the identities of scrapped sister locomotives 55 003 &quot;Meld&quot;, 55 007 &quot;Pinza&quot; and 55 018 &quot;Ballymoss&quot;. 55 022 alongside classmate 55 016 were later purchased by Locomotive Services Limited and since arriving at Crewe 55 022 has been undergoing an overhaul to return to the mainline hauling railtours for Locomotive Services Limited and its new charter train operator &quot;Saphos Trains&quot;. Parts from 55 016 are being used in the engine&#x27;s overhaul while the latter engine is on static display in Margate.
* D9002 (55 002) &quot;The King&#x27;s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry&quot; was donated to the National Railway Museum, York and was the first preserved Deltic to return to the main line when it worked light engine to York after participating in the Doncaster Works Open Day on 27 February 1982. 55 002 is one of three Deltics to hold mainline certification (along with D9000 &quot;Royal Scots Grey&quot; and D9009 &quot;Alycidon&quot;). 55 002 is rarely used on mainline charters and is mostly used to haul locomotives belonging to the National Railway Museum either between their two sites at York and Shildon or to other destinations such as Barrow Hill Engine Shed.
* D9009 (55 009) &quot;Alycidon&quot; was purchased by the Deltic Preservation Society (DPS). It was initially based at the North York Moors Railway before undergoing an extensive overhaul and restoration and recertification for main-line use. Following the DPS withdrawal from main-line operations it was mostly based at the DPS depot at Barrow Hill. It was recertified for mainline use in July 2012 after a long absence stretching back to 2003. On 3 March 2019, 55 009 was hauling the &#x27;Auld Reekie&#x27; from Edinburgh – Doncaster where all 6 traction motors flashed over. 55 009 has not worked since and was hauled back to Burton by British Rail Class 67 67004. 55 009 is now at the Great Central Railway (heritage railway) for testing following extensive repairs.
* D9015 (55 015) &quot;Tulyar&quot; was purchased by a private buyer, Peter Sansom; in 1986 it was sold on to the Deltic Preservation Society. It has led a nomadic existence on many preserved railways and was the favoured DPS locomotive for open days during the 1990s (where it was sometimes presented in the guise of a scrapped sister locomotive, for example during 1994 when it appeared at various events numbered and named as 55 001 &quot;St Paddy&quot;. It is currently under major overhaul at the Deltic Preservation Society depot at Barrow Hill.
* D9016 (55 016) &quot;Gordon Highlander&quot; was purchased by the Deltic 9000 Fund, with the intention that it would be restored to running condition, whilst acting as a &#x27;twelve wheeled mobile source of spares&#x27;. It was moved to Wansford, on the Nene Valley Railway to join D9000. Eventually, like D9000, the locomotive left the railway for the Network SouthEast depots at Selhurst and Old Oak Common. After D9000 had been operating on the main line for three years the decision was made to overhaul and recertify D9016, to provide cover for &quot;Royal Scots Grey&quot;, and the locomotive was moved to Brush Traction at Loughborough. Following overhaul it spent a short period on the main line, on charter work, its operation sponsored by Porterbrook, in recognition of which it was painted in their purple and grey house colours, based upon the original two-tone green style. It lasted in this livery until 2002, when the original two-tone green livery was reapplied. Following the demise of Deltic 9000 Locomotives Limited the locomotive was purchased and based at the Peak Rail (Heritage Railway), near Bakewell, Derbyshire. In July 2008, this locomotive was sold by the private owner to Harry Needle Railroad Company (HNRC). Despite previous announcements to the contrary, HNRC put the locomotive up for sale at the end of September 2008. Bids from the Gordon Highlander Preservation Group and Beaver Sports (Yorks) Ltd. (the owners of 55 022) were rejected by HNRC in favour of a higher offer from Direct Rail Services who kept D9016 at Barrow Hill for a year with the intention of a full overhaul but these plans never surfaced. The locomotive was sold one year later to Beaver Sports (Yorks) Ltd. and it was based at East Lancashire Railway with 55 022.&lt;br&gt;The aim was to return D9016 to mainline condition once again. D9016 donated one of its two engines to 55 022 in April 2010 to replace one of 55 022&#x27;s engines, a former marine example that had been temporarily fitted to 55 022 following an earlier engine failure. During 2014 D9016 left the East Lancashire Railway for the Great Central Railway. In January 2015 the locomotive moved to the Washwood Heath site of Boden Rail, for bodywork repairs. D9016, along with classmate 55 022, were later purchased by Locomotive Services Limited. D9016 required a cosmetic overhaul, owing to damaged areas. With the main intention being to return 55 022 to service first parts were taken off D9016 for use on 55 022 and after being given a cosmetic touchup. 16 was returned to its original BR Green with its pre-TOPS number, D9016. The engine would later be moved to Margate for static display at LSL&#x27;s new museum at the Hornby factory.
* D9019 (55 019) &quot;Royal Highland Fusilier&quot; was purchased by the Deltic Preservation Society. Initially based at the North York Moors Railway, along with 55 009, the locomotive subsequently moved and spent several years at both the Great Central Railway and the East Lancashire Railway. It is now based at the Deltic Preservation Society depot at Barrow Hill. In April 2005 it became the first Deltic to be fitted with TPWS equipment.
Two cabs were saved after withdrawal:
* One cab from D9008 (55 008) &quot;The Green Howards&quot; was acquired when the locomotive was being scrapped at Doncaster Works in August 1982. 55 008 is mounted on a road trailer and has been fitted out with computer simulation equipment which allows anybody to take the controls. In October 2003, the cab was painted to masquerade as British Rail DP2.
* One cab from D9021 (55 021) &quot;Argyll &amp; Sutherland Highlander&quot; was acquired when the locomotive was scrapped at Doncaster Works in September 1982. It was privately purchased and positioned within sight of the Great Western Main Line at South Stoke, west of Reading. It was later sold to another private owner before being purchased by the Deltic Preservation Society. It has subsequently been sold on to the South Wales Loco Cab Preservation Group.

== Operations after BR withdrawal ==
Despite the ban on privately owned diesel locomotives operating on BR tracks, railway enthusiasts did not have to wait that long after the final withdrawal of the class to see a Deltic back on the mainline. Following participation in the hastily arranged &#x27;Farewell to the Deltics&#x27; open day at British Rail Engineering Limited&#x27;s Doncaster Works on 27 February 1982, 55 002 left Doncaster under its own power and ran back up the ECML to the National Railway Museum light engine; it was to be some years before a Deltic was officially allowed to run again on the mainline.

The next opportunity to see a Deltic back on the mainline and running under its own power was in April 1985 when D9000 was sent (at the request of ScotRail management) light engine from Haymarket depot to Perth for an open day. Following newspaper comments by ScotRail&#x27;s manager Chris Green around that time there was hope that D9000 might see regular work on ScotRail&#x27;s lines. Chris Green&#x27;s move to the management team at the newly created Network SouthEast in 1986 put paid to that. However, that did not end his involvement with D9000. He arranged for Network South East depots to provide accommodation for both D9000 and D9016 and when he moved on to head up Virgin Rail Group D9000 was used on summer Saturday Virgin CrossCountry services in the late 1990s.

With the changes taking place on Britain&#x27;s railways in the 1990s, the outlook changed for preserved diesel locomotives. In British Rail days no privately owned diesel locomotives were allowed to operate on its tracks. With privatisation came open-access railways—the track and infrastructure were owned and operated by Railtrack, who for a fee would allow approved locomotives and trains to operate on their track. Suddenly, the owners of preserved locomotives were on an equal footing with everyone else. In fact, the characteristics of the Deltic locomotives, powerful and capable of cruising at , enabled them to fit more easily onto the modern rail network than other, slower, preserved diesels.

In 1996 the Deltic 9000 Fund was incorporated as Deltic 9000 Locomotives Ltd (DNLL) with the objective of returning its locomotives to main-line service and on 30 November 1996 D9000 &quot;Royal Scots Grey&quot; hauled the &#x27;Deltic Deliverance&#x27; charter from Edinburgh to King&#x27;s Cross. This tour however ended prematurely at Berwick-upon-Tweed after a fire broke out in the loco&#x27;s engine room. D9000 went on to haul many charter trains and service trains for both Anglia Railways and Virgin CrossCountry until 2003. Subsequently, DNLL&#x27;s other Deltic, D9016 &quot;Gordon Highlander&quot; returned to main-line working (it was temporarily painted in a purple and grey livery based upon the house colours of Porterbrook, who helped finance the restoration), as did the Deltic Preservation Society&#x27;s D9009 &quot;Alycidon&quot; and 55 019 &quot;Royal Highland Fusilier&quot;. Between 1997 and 2003 all four main-line certified locomotives saw frequent charter and spot hire use, including on the Venice Simplon Orient Express. A highlight of this period was 22 May 1999, when D9000 &quot;Royal Scots Grey&quot;, D9009 &quot;Alycidon&quot; and 55 019 &quot;Royal Highland Fusilier&quot; were all in operation on the East Coast Main Line on the same day – D9000 running the &quot;George Mortimer Pullman&quot; British Pullman between London Victoria and Bradford Forster Square and the DPS Deltics working two charter trains between King&#x27;s Cross and York. On the return run from Bradford, D9000 was held in platform 1 at Doncaster, whilst 55 019 passed on the up through line. D9000 then followed 55 019 as far as Belle Isle, where it diverged for the run around London to Victoria.

In 2003, DNLL went into liquidation with the result that D9000 and D9016 were sold to private individuals. From July 2003 to March 2005 no Deltics hauled a train on the main line. After a brief return to the main line in 2005 the DPS withdrew their last Deltic (55 019) at the end of 2005, having run three tours during the year. D9015 &quot;Tulyar&quot; is currently undergoing a full overhaul at Barrow Hill, with the aim of main line operation, whilst 55 002 &quot;The King&#x27;s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry&quot; is currently painted in BR blue, main line certificated, and operates from the National Railway Museum. 55 019 remains in full working order along with D9009, whilst D9016 is currently able to operate on one engine only.

On 23 September 2006, 55 022 (D9000) &quot;Royal Scots Grey&quot; returned to the main line after a lengthy and extensive restoration at Barrow Hill, carried out on behalf of the owners by the DPS. It successfully hauled the SRPS &#x27;Moray Mint&#x27; railtour from Edinburgh to Inverness, via Perth on the outward trip and back via Aberdeen. On its second working two weeks later, severe damage occurred to the number 2 end engine. The engine suffered from &quot;a leg out of bed&quot;, a term which means the engine con-rod breaks out of the engine crankcase. This left &quot;Royal Scots Grey&quot; still able to operate but on one engine only. By January 2007, the faulty power unit was removed from 55 022, put into storage and replaced by an ex-marine Napier Deltic engine modified for rail use; work was completed by &quot;Royal Scots Grey&quot;&#x27;s restoration team in August 2007. After extensive testing at the East Lancs Railway the locomotive hauled its first tour since the previous engine malfunction on RTC&#x27;s &#x27;Autumn Highlander&#x27; with 50 049 and 40 145 in October 2007. 55 022 successfully hauled a number of charter tour services during 2008 but the replacement marine-sourced engine gave rise for concern following the discovery of oil in the coolant and at the end of August the locomotive was removed from future large railtour duties. The locomotive continued working mainline duty by visiting other preserved railway and moving other non-mainline registered locomotives.

In mid January 2007, an agreement was reached between heritage railway Peak Rail and the owner of D9016 &quot;Gordon Highlander&quot; which entailed the move of the locomotive from Barrow Hill to the preserved line for a period of three years. It had been thought that D9016 would receive certain maintenance and restoration while on the railway. However, the sale of the locomotive to the Harry Needle Railroad Company and subsequent announcements indicated that the weekend runs of 27 and 28 September 2008 might be its last prior to component recovery and eventual scrapping. Despite previous indications to the contrary, HNRC put the locomotive up for sale during the last week of September 2008 and although the Gordon Highlander Preservation Group submitted a substantial bid it was not accepted and the immediate future (and owner) of the locomotive was shrouded in some mystery.
Subsequently, in October 2008, DRS announced in a press release that it had acquired D9016 &quot;Gordon Highlander&quot; from Harry Needle Railroad Company (HNRC): &quot;The company is working with HNRC to return the locomotive to operational condition, although at the time of writing (June 2009) the locomotive is still stored at Barrow Hill awaiting attention. While the locomotive is not planned for an immediate return to service, DRS is confident that the locomotive will be returned to mainline service in the future. DRS intends to retain the locomotive&#x27;s name&quot;. On 29 December 2009, it was announced that D9016 had been purchased by Beaver Sports (Yorks) Limited. It has subsequently operated (on one engine) on the East Lancashire Railway and the Great Central Railway, pending work to restore it to full working order.

In April 2011, 55 022 was hired in by GB Railfreight for bauxite freight working between North Blyth and the Lynemouth aluminium smelter. This hire was scheduled to last from April to July. From May 2013 to November 2015, 55 022 was chartered by GBRF to transfer First ScotRail EMU&#x27;s for refurbishment. These included the entire fleet of s, which were moved between Yoker and Kilmarnock. The route taken, partially to prevent false fire alarms in underground tunnels caused by the Deltic engine&#x27;s emissions, takes the train as far as Craigendoran on the north bank of the Clyde before turning round toward Kilmarnock.

On 29 November 2017 it was announced via the official Royal Scots Grey website that 55 022 and D9016, plus all spares, had been sold by Martin Walker to Locomotive Services Limited, with both making the trip to LSL&#x27;s Crewe Diesel TMD base in December 2017. It is intended that both locomotives will ultimately be repaired (55 022 currently has engine problems and D9016 is coming to the end of bodywork repairs) and operated on the mainline alongside Hosking&#x27;s sizable locomotive fleet. By June 2018, 55 022 was under repair while D9016 had been placed in store and was transferred, cosmetically restored, to Locomotive Storage Limited&#x27;s facility at Margate.

== Proposed Deltic locomotives ==

A Bo-Bo locomotive, using a single 18-cylinder Deltic engine, was proposed as an alternative to what became the British Rail Class 37 Type 3 locomotive introduced from 1960.

A Co-Co &quot;Super Deltic&quot; was proposed but not built. There were three potential designs between weighing between with a maximum axle load of . The locomotives would have looked very similar to the eventual Class 50s, though slightly longer. All three designs would have had two 18-cylinder turbocharged engines, based on the 9-cylinder turbocharged engine used in the British Rail Class 23 &quot;Baby Deltic&quot; and the locomotive would have been designated Class 51. The Class 55&#x27;s engines were not turbocharged, although they did have centrifugal scavenging blowers.

==Model Railways==
The first OO gauge model was produced by Hornby Dublo in two versions. D9012 &quot;Crepello&quot; was the two-rail version and D9001 &quot;St Paddy&quot; was the three-rail version. The second OO gauge model was produced by Lima, in two versions initially: D9003 &quot;Meld&quot; in BR Green; and 9006 &quot;The Fife &amp; Forfar Yeomanry&quot; in BR Blue. The same models were also released in N gauge (1:160 scale), however these did not last very long, as Lima eventually decided to concentrate its British outline output on OO gauge.

Bachmann have since released a new version of the &quot;Deltic&quot;, in both the OO gauge &quot;Branchline&quot; range and their N gauge &quot;Graham Farish&quot; range. Bachmann have also produced the &quot;Deltic Prototype&quot; in OO gauge (previously only available as a plastic kit from either Kitmaster or Dapol), however this had been commissioned by Locomotion Models – the model railways arm of the Nation Railway Museum – and was not generally available in model shops. A &quot;Graham Farish&quot; N gauge model is available, as a stand-alone model, and as part of the &quot;Merseyside Express&quot; train set.

In 2012 Hornby Railways launched a version of the BR Class 55, which is basic representation of the prototype as part of their Railroad range in BR Blue and BR Green in OO gauge. This model was essentially the old Lima tooling with a new chassis.

Accurascale announced a new range of OO gauge &quot;Deltics&quot;, in a wide variety of liveries, which were released in summer 2022.

In February 2023 Hornby announced a new diecast Dublo tooling in OO gauge of the Deltic prototype locomotive, English Electric DP1 &#x27;Deltic&#x27;, fitted with sound (R30297TXS).

<doc id="422776" wikidata="Q5251956" url="?curid=422776" title="That'll Be the Day">
<text>&quot;That&#x27;ll Be the Day&quot; is a song written by Buddy Holly and Jerry Allison. It was first recorded by Buddy Holly and the Three Tunes in 1956 and was re-recorded in 1957 by Holly and his new band, the Crickets. The 1957 recording achieved widespread success. Holly&#x27;s producer, Norman Petty, was credited as a co-writer, although he did not contribute to the composition.

Many other versions have been recorded. It was the first song recorded (as a demonstration disc) by the Quarrymen, a skiffle group from Liverpool that evolved into the Beatles.

The 1957 recording was certified gold (for over a million US sales) by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1969. It was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998. It was placed in the National Recording Registry, a list of sound recordings that &quot;are culturally, historically, or aesthetically important, and/or inform or reflect life in the United States&quot;, in 2005.

==Background==
In June 1956, Holly along with his older brother Larry as well as Allison and Sonny Curtis went to see the film &quot;The Searchers&quot;, starring John Wayne, in which Wayne repeatedly used the phrase &quot;that&#x27;ll be the day&quot;. This line of dialogue inspired the young musicians.

==Buddy Holly and the Three Tunes&#x27; version==
The song was first recorded by Buddy Holly and the Three Tunes for Decca Records at Bradley Studios in Nashville, on July 22, 1956. Decca, displeased with Holly&#x27;s previous two singles, did not issue recordings from this session. After the song was re-recorded by the Crickets in 1957 and became a hit, Decca released the original recording as a single (Decca D30434) on September 2, 1957, with &quot;Rock Around with Ollie Vee&quot; as the B-side. It was also the title track of the 1958 album &quot;That&#x27;ll Be the Day&quot;. Despite Holly&#x27;s newfound stardom, the single did not chart.

==The Crickets&#x27; version==
Holly&#x27;s contract with Decca prohibited him from re-recording any of the songs recorded in the 1956 Nashville sessions for five years, even if Decca never released them. To evade this restriction, the producer Norman Petty credited the Crickets as the artist on his re-recording of &quot;That&#x27;ll Be the Day&quot; for Brunswick Records. Brunswick was a subsidiary of Decca. Once the cat was out of the bag, Decca re-signed Holly to another of its subsidiaries, Coral Records, so he ended up with two recording contracts. Recordings with the Crickets were to be issued by Brunswick, and the recordings under Holly&#x27;s name were to be on Coral, although the Crickets played on several of them.

The second recording of the song was made on February 25, 1957, seven months after the first, at the Norman Petty studios in Clovis, New Mexico, and issued by Brunswick on July 27, 1957. This version is on the debut album by the Crickets, &quot;The &quot;Chirping&quot; Crickets&quot;, issued on November 27, 1957. The recording was made with everyone performing and without additional overdubs. The B-side of the record, &quot;I&#x27;m Looking for Someone to Love&quot; was recorded at the same session with the same backup singers.

The Brunswick recording of &quot;That&#x27;ll Be the Day&quot; is considered a classic of rock and roll. It was ranked number 39 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;.

===Chart performance===
The Brunswick single was a number-one hit on &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s Best Sellers in Stores chart in 1957. It went to number two on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s R&amp;B singles chart. The song peaked at number 1 in the UK Singles Chart in November 1957 and stayed in that position for three weeks.

On December 20, 1969, a reissue of the single by Coral Records was awarded a &quot;gold single&quot; by the RIAA.

On September 20, 1986, the song appeared on the UK Singles Chart at number 85 and left the chart a week later.

In Canada, her version peaked at number 2 on the singles chart and was the 35th biggest hit of 1976. It also made the adult contemporary charts in the United States and Canada. This recording is included on the album &quot;Linda Ronstadt&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot; (1976) and on the 2011 tribute album &quot;Listen to Me: Buddy Holly&quot;.

<text>James Nathaniel Toney (born August 24, 1968) is an American former professional boxer who competed from 1988 to 2017. He held multiple world championships in three weight classes, including the International Boxing Federation (IBF) and lineal middleweight titles from 1991 to 1993, the IBF super middleweight title from 1993 to 1994, and the IBF cruiserweight title in 2003. Toney also challenged twice for a world heavyweight title in 2005 and 2006, and was victorious the first time but was later stripped due to a failed drug test. Overall, he competed in fifteen world title fights across four weight classes.

Stylistically a defensive boxer, Toney utilized the shoulder roll technique taught to him by veteran trainer Bill Miller, who had once trained heavyweight champion Ezzard Charles. Toney was an exceptional counterpuncher and inside fighter, who often preferred to fight off the ropes. He possessed fast hand speed and respectable punching power throughout his career and is also noted for his toughness, having never lost any of his 92 professional bouts via stoppage.

In 1991 and 2003, Toney was voted Fighter of the Year by &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine and the Boxing Writers Association of America. In 2011, &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine ranked him as tenth on their list of the &quot;10 best middleweight title holders of the last 50 years.&quot; He has also made a one-time appearance in mixed martial arts, losing to Randy Couture at UFC 118. In 2001, Toney played the role of Joe Frazier in the movie &quot;Ali&quot; alongside Will Smith.

==Early life==
Toney was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, U.S. At around age 11, Toney first entered a boxing gym, but did not seriously pursue the sport until graduating high school. Growing up, Toney lived alongside the families of Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Buster Mathis Jr., and Toney&#x27;s father himself (who was absent for Toney&#x27;s upbringing) was a boxer. As a teen, Toney was often involved in street fighting and sold crack cocaine. Prior to his career in boxing, Toney was also a star football player; after high school he received scholarship offers from Western Michigan to play quarterback and from Michigan to play as a defensive back. But Toney said, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t a team player and wasn&#x27;t good at taking orders. So I went into boxing.&quot; Toney also lost a significant amount of weight to begin his boxing career, having weighed 205 lbs. Toney was supposedly involved in an altercation with future Pro Football Hall of Famer Deion Sanders while at a Michigan training camp.

==Amateur career==
Toney had a brief but relatively successful amateur career, compiling a record of 33 wins (32 KOs) and 2 losses. Toney had his first professional fight on October 26, 1988, beating Stephen Lee by a technical knockout in the second round. As a teenager, Toney was scouted and trained by Gregory Owens, who also was his trainer through the mid-nineties. His moniker of &quot;Lights Out&quot; was also given by either Gregory or his son. In his 7th pro fight, Toney&#x27;s manager, Johnny &quot;Ace&quot; Smith, was killed. Afterwards, Jackie Kallen was hired as his manager. Toney also employed the services of legendary Detroit-based trainer Bill Miller. Miller, a former boxer himself who worked in Detroit&#x27;s famed Kronk Gym and assisted hall-of-fame trainer Emanuel Steward at times, is credited with developing Toney&#x27;s famed &quot;old school&quot; or &quot;throwback&quot; style of fighting.

==Professional career==
===Middleweight===

Toney won the IBF and lineal middleweight titles by knocking out Michael Nunn in eleven rounds in May 1991. Toney, who entered as a 20-to-1 underdog, was down on all three judges&#x27; scorecards, but landed a left hook that put Nunn on the canvas in the eleventh round, and eventually scored a stoppage victory. The win also earned Toney the Ring Magazine Fighter Of The Year award. Toney continued a regular fight program over the next 18 months at middleweight, before outgrowing the division, where he made several successful yet disputed defenses. The most noteworthy was Toney&#x27;s split decision win over Dave Tiberi in a fight that many experts feel Toney lost. The decision was so controversial that it prompted United States Senator William Roth of Delaware to call for an investigation into possible corruption in the sport. Toney also won a split decision title defense against Reggie Johnson in June 1991, retained his title with a draw against former WBA champ Mike McCallum in December 1991, and again against McCallum, this time by a majority decision, in December 1992. The McCallum fight would be Toney&#x27;s last as a middleweight.

===Super middleweight===

On February 13, 1993, Toney challenged Iran Barkley for the IBF super middleweight title. After a dominating performance by Toney, the bout was stopped after 9 rounds by Barkley&#x27;s trainer, Eddie Mustafa Muhammad, due to Barkley suffering severe swelling around both eyes.

Toney won five fights throughout 1993, then defeated Tony &quot;The Punching Postman&quot; Thornton in his 1st title defense in October, via a landslide points victory. In his second defense, Toney beat the 24–0 Tim Littles by a 4th-round KO. During this bout, Toney suffered a bad cut which caused the referee and ringside doctor to intervene before round 4, allowing him one more round to try to end the fight. His next defense was against former IBF Light Heavyweight champion Prince Charles Williams. Despite having a point deducted for hitting Williams after the bell in one round and having his left eye completely swollen shut, Toney knocked Williams out in the 12th and final round. This win paved the way for his fight with undefeated 1988 Olympic silver medalist Roy Jones Jr.

====Toney vs. Jones Jr.====

Jones won a landslide decision over Toney, an upset at the time, briefly flooring Toney for the first time with a flash knockdown in the 3rd round. Jones used one of his &quot;cockfighting&quot; feints to lure Toney in, and as Toney mocked Jones, Toney got caught with a leaping left hook. After the fight Toney blamed making the weight for his flat performance and the loss of his cherished unbeaten record. It was his last fight at the weight.

===Light heavyweight===

His next fight saw him lose to Montell Griffin at light heavyweight in February 1995. After then winning a series of fights at light heavyweight, cruiserweight, and even heavyweight, he again faced Montell Griffin in December 1996 and once again lost a close decision. He beat old foe Mike McCallum in February 1997, but then lost to journeyman Drake Thadzi in his next fight.

===Cruiserweight===

After taking some time off from the ring, Toney came back in 1999, seemingly focused on reclaiming his status as an elite fighter. He defeated former title holders and title contenders Adolpho Washington, Steve Little, Ramón Garbey, Saul Montana, Sione Asipeli, Courtney Butler, and Michael Rush. In August 2002, Toney beat Jason Robinson in an IBF Cruiserweight title elimination fight. This set up a fight between Toney and the champion, Vassiliy Jirov. After a postponement, the fight happened on April 26, 2003. Going into the 12th and final round, with the scores fairly even and the fight in the balance, Toney knocked the undefeated Jirov down in the 12th. The Kazakh rose from the canvas to go to the distance, but Toney got the judges verdict and was now a three-weight World Champion.

For Toney&#x27;s performance he was awarded comeback of the year and named fighter of the year. The fight itself was named &quot;Fight Of The Year&quot; by &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine. Immediately afterward, Toney moved up to heavyweight, where he campaigned for the next 7 years.

===Heavyweight===

As far back as Toney&#x27;s middleweight years, he insisted that he would one day be the heavyweight champion of the world. His October 4, 2003, victory over aging former heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield was Toney&#x27;s entry into the heavyweight division. After a shaky first round, Toney picked apart Holyfield with shots to the body and head before stopping him in the 9th round. After the fight Toney declared he was &quot;undestructable&quot;, that he &quot;got milk baby&quot; and didn&#x27;t want any &quot;bad ass questions&quot; from announcer Jim Gray.

On September 23, 2004, Toney faced off with Rydell Booker. Although Toney injured his left arm, he was still able to defeat the clearly outmatched Booker, getting a 12-round unanimous decision for the fringe IBA heavyweight title.

On April 30, 2005, he defeated John Ruiz by a unanimous decision in a 12-round match for the World Boxing Association (WBA) heavyweight Championship. However, Toney failed his post-fight drug test, testing positive for the anabolic steroid stanozolol. This led to the New York Athletic Commission changing the bout&#x27;s official outcome to a &quot;no-contest&quot;, deducting the win from Toney&#x27;s career record and banning him from boxing for 90 days. The WBA ordered that Ruiz be reinstated as its champion and that Toney be ineligible for another WBA Heavyweight title shot for two years. Toney defended himself by claiming that the steroids were given to him by a doctor to treat the arm injury he suffered during the Rydell Booker fight.

In his bout after the Ruiz fight, Toney won a unanimous decision victory over former heavyweight contender Dominic Guinn. Toney next fought against Hasim Rahman on March 18, 2006, for the WBC Heavyweight title. The result was a twelve-round majority draw.

Toney&#x27;s next two outings were losses to Samuel Peter. The first fight was held in Los Angeles, California, on September 2, 2006. Toney lost by split decision. The return bout was held in Hollywood, Florida, on January 6, 2007, and Toney once again lost to Peter, this time by unanimous decision. Both fights were WBC eliminator bouts for the belt held by Oleg Maskaev.

Toney&#x27;s next bout came on December 13, 2008, against Fres Oquendo. Oquendo was penalized one point in round eight for a rabbit punch, which would prove to be the deciding factor in the fight. Toney won a close, controversial split decision. On September 12, 2009, James fought heavyweight fighter Matthew Greer (12–5–0 11KO) at the Pechanga Resort &amp; Casino. James won via TKO victory in round two.

On February 24, 2011, Toney made his return to boxing and won a ten-round unanimous decision against Damon Reed. All three judges scored the bout 100–90. For this bout Toney weighed in at a career high of 257 lbs.

===Return to cruiserweight===
After stepping back down to Cruiserweight, on November 4, 2011, Toney stepped into the ring at 199 lbs, the lowest he has been since 2003 against Russian star Denis Lebedev in Russia for the interim WBA World cruiserweight title. Toney was never competitive throughout the bout after encountering problems with his left knee during round two, and the judges all had it 120–108 for Lebedev. A week after the fight it was revealed Toney needed surgery to repair his knee.

===Return to heavyweight===
On April 7, 2012, Toney fought Bobby Gunn and won by a fifth round stoppage due to a hand injury sustained by Gunn. This was recognized as a world title by the International Boxing Union, a minor boxing organization.

Toney travelled to Australia in April 2013 to face Lucas Browne for the WBF heavyweight title. Toney lost the fight by wide unanimous decision. Seven months later on November 14, Toney travelled to London, England to compete in the heavyweight Prizefighter Series held at the famous York Hall venue. It was a special UK vs USA tournament with six fighters facing off in three round bouts. In the quarter-final, Toney faced English journeyman Matt Legg, and won by TKO in the third round, advancing to the semi-finals. In the semi-final, he faced fellow American Jason Gavern and lost by majority decision, and was eliminated from the tournament.

Toney&#x27;s final bout came on May 13, 2017, at the age of 48. He defeated Mike Sheppard by sixth round stoppage; winning the WBF heavyweight title. After a career spanning 29 years and 92 professional bouts, Toney has confirmed he is officially retired.

== Exhibition bout ==
Toney made a comeback to the ring at age 55 on November 11, 2023, when he fought 59-year-old Donovan Ruddock, a former top ranked heavyweight contender, in Kingston, Jamaica. The fight went all six rounds and was scored a draw, with the first two rounds being a standard three minutes, while the later four were shortened to two minutes. Both men were criticized for their lousy athletic appearances and sluggish slow pace, as both were clearly showing their senior age. Nevertheless, the fight went the distance.

==Fighting style==
Toney is well known for his &quot;old school&quot; or &quot;throwback&quot; style of boxing, which consisted of frequent head movement and shoulder rolls to avoid punches, as well as his ability to fight off the ropes using slick upper body movement and in-fighting. As such, he is said to have possessed a very high ring IQ. Although Toney was considered a defensive fighter by many, he still applied pressure to his opponents and usually forced his style against them; in some ways he could be considered a defensive pressure fighter. Because of his experience, defensive skills and extremely durable chin, he was never stopped in his 29-year professional career and was rarely knocked down.

==Mixed martial arts career==
Toney was spotted in attendance at UFC 108 on January 2, 2010, which led to talks between him and UFC President Dana White regarding fighting in the organization. On March 3, it was confirmed by White that the two had agreed and signed a multi-fight deal with the company, at the age of 42.

To help his transition into MMA, Toney was coached by trainer Juanito Ibarra. Toney was later coached by Trevor Sherman.

===Toney vs. Couture, UFC 118===
His debut fight was against UFC Hall of Famer and former UFC Heavyweight and Light Heavyweight champion Randy Couture at UFC 118 on August 28, 2010. Couture scored a takedown against Toney early in the first round, and went on to submit him with an arm-triangle choke. Toney was subsequently released from his contract with the UFC. The match achieved notoriety, though it drew criticisms of being a freak show fight, among them by UFC President Dana White himself. Toney&#x27;s purse was around $500,000 opposed to Couture&#x27;s $250,000.

=== Cancelled bout with Ken Shamrock ===
In the aftermath of his loss and release from the UFC, Toney stated he would &quot;100 Percent&quot; compete in MMA again, saying he would fight regardless if it was not in the UFC. He would later be attached to a mix rules venture bout against MMA pioneer and UFC veteran Ken Shamrock scheduled for November 2011. In October 2011, the event was cancelled and the bout never materialized beyond that. UFC 118 remains Toney&#x27;s sole appearance in mixed martial arts.

<doc id="422786" wikidata="Q1071077" url="?curid=422786" title="Primorial">
<text>In mathematics, and more particularly in number theory, primorial, denoted by &quot;&quot;, is a function from natural numbers to natural numbers similar to the factorial function, but rather than successively multiplying positive integers, the function only multiplies prime numbers.

The name &quot;primorial&quot;, coined by Harvey Dubner, draws an analogy to &quot;primes&quot; similar to the way the name &quot;factorial&quot; relates to &quot;factors&quot;.

== Definition for prime numbers ==
For the th prime number , the primorial is defined as the product of the first primes:

:formula_1,

where is the th prime number. For instance, signifies the product of the first 5 primes:

:formula_2

The first five primorials are:

:2, 6, 30, 210, 2310 .

The sequence also includes as empty product. Asymptotically, primorials grow according to:

:formula_3

where is Little O notation.

== Definition for natural numbers ==
In general, for a positive integer , its primorial, , is the product of the primes that are not greater than ; that is,

:formula_4,

where is the prime-counting function , which gives the number of primes ≤ . This is equivalent to:

:formula_5

For example, 12# represents the product of those primes ≤ 12:

:formula_6

Since , this can be calculated as:

:formula_7

Consider the first 12 values of :

:1, 2, 6, 6, 30, 30, 210, 210, 210, 210, 2310, 2310.

We see that for composite every term simply duplicates the preceding term , as given in the definition. In the above example we have since 12 is a composite number.

Primorials are related to the first Chebyshev function, written according to:

:formula_8

Since asymptotically approaches for large values of , primorials therefore grow according to:
:formula_9

The idea of multiplying all known primes occurs in some proofs of the infinitude of the prime numbers, where it is used to derive the existence of another prime.

== Characteristics ==

* Let and be two adjacent prime numbers. Given any formula_10, where formula_11:
:formula_12
* For the Primorial, the following approximation is known:
:formula_13.

Notes:

# Using elementary methods, mathematician Denis Hanson showed that formula_14
# Using more advanced methods, Rosser and Schoenfeld showed that formula_15
# Rosser and Schoenfeld in Theorem 4, formula 3.14, showed that for formula_16, formula_17

* Furthermore:
:formula_18
:For formula_19, the values are smaller than , but for larger , the values of the function exceed the limit and oscillate infinitely around later on.

* Let formula_20 be the -th prime, then formula_21 has exactly formula_22 divisors. For example, formula_23 has 2 divisors, formula_24 has 4 divisors, formula_25 has 8 divisors and formula_26 already has formula_27 divisors, as 97 is the 25th prime.
* The sum of the reciprocal values of the primorial converges towards a constant
:formula_28
:The Engel expansion of this number results in the sequence of the prime numbers (See )

*According to Euclid&#x27;s theorem, formula_29 is used to prove the infinitude of the prime numbers.

== Applications and properties ==

Primorials play a role in the search for prime numbers in additive arithmetic progressions. For instance, 
 + 23# results in a prime, beginning a sequence of thirteen primes found by repeatedly adding 23#, and ending with . 23# is also the common difference in arithmetic progressions of fifteen and sixteen primes.

Every highly composite number is a product of primorials (e.g. 360 = ).

Primorials are all square-free integers, and each one has more distinct prime factors than any number smaller than it. For each primorial , the fraction is smaller than for any lesser integer, where is the Euler totient function.

Any completely multiplicative function is defined by its values at primorials, since it is defined by its values at primes, which can be recovered by division of adjacent values.

Base systems corresponding to primorials (such as base 30, not to be confused with the primorial number system) have a lower proportion of repeating fractions than any smaller base.

Every primorial is a sparsely totient number.

The -compositorial of a composite number is the product of all composite numbers up to and including . The -compositorial is equal to the -factorial divided by the primorial . The compositorials are
:1, 4, 24, 192, 1728, , , , , , ...

== Appearance ==

The Riemann zeta function at positive integers greater than one can be expressed by using the primorial function and Jordan&#x27;s totient function :

<text>Sir Philip Hoby (also Hobby or Hobbye) PC (1505 – 31 May 1558) was a 16th-century English Ambassador to the Holy Roman Empire and Flanders.

==Early life==
He was born probably at Leominster, England, the son of William Hoby of Leominster by his first wife, Catherine Forster. He was the elder half-brother of Sir Thomas Hoby, father of Edward and Thomas Posthumous Hoby.

Hoby became a diplomat, largely thanks to the support he gave to the Protestant Reformation during the reign of King Henry VIII.

==Career==
He travelled to Spain and Portugal in the royal service. On 10 March 1538 he arrived at Brussels with the painter Hans Holbein the younger. Thomas Cromwell had sent them to make a portrait of Christina, Duchess of Milan for Henry VIII. The English resident in Brussels, John Hutton, had already obtained a portrait, but realising this portrait was not as perfect as one made by &quot;Master Haunce&quot;, &quot;a man very excellent in makyng of phisanymies,&quot; he recalled his messenger. Hoby was introduced to a courtier of the Regent of the Netherlands, Lord Benedict Court, and they spoke together in Italian. Benedict, who was Grand Master of the Duchess&#x27; house, then made the arrangements for Holbein to have a sitting of three hours with the Duchess, where he &quot;proved himself the master of his science.&quot; Hoby and Holbein departed the same night taking leave of the Duchess, (making a formal farewell), but not to the Lady Regent. Henry received the portrait of Christina on 18 March 1538 and was delighted.
On a second trip to France, Hoby and Holbein painted the Princess Margaret of France, and perhaps Mary of Bourbon, then they arrived at Joinville in France at the end of August 1538. They wanted a portrait of Louise de Guise, daughter of Antoinette, Duchess of Guise. Hoby mentioned that they had been to Nancy. Antoinette guessed they had obtained the portrait of Anna of Lorraine there, and joked with her daughter, the Queen of Scotland, that soon either her sister or her cousin would become her neighbour by marrying Henry VIII.

By 1542, he was a gentlemen usher of the King&#x27;s Privy Chamber, and was involved in the persecution of Jews. In 1543, however, Hoby was briefly held in the Fleet Prison on suspicion of heretical beliefs. Following the Siege of Boulogne, Hoby was knighted and received gifts of property, including some of the profits from the Dissolution of the Monasteries. In 1545, he became Master of the Ordnance in the North, and in 1547, Master-General of the Ordnance, a post he held until 1554. In 1547 he replaced John Cock as MP for Cardiff Boroughs when Cock resigned to sit for Calne. In 1548, he succeeded Bishop Thomas Thirlby as ambassador to the court of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. During this period, he helped plot the downfall of the Lord Protector, Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset.

In 1551, Hoby was involved in attempts to negotiate a marriage between King Edward VI and Elizabeth, the daughter of King Henry II of France. He was also trusted to negotiate loans with from merchants in Antwerp, and was involved in a diplomatic mission to Flanders. He was admitted to the Privy Council in March 1552. The manor of Bisham Abbey in Berkshire was given to him, at the expense of the former queen, Anne of Cleves.

In 1553, Hoby was again at the court of Charles V, trying to negotiate a peace between him and Henry II of France. Shortly afterwards, he became ambassador to Flanders. During the brief reign of Lady Jane Grey, Hoby appears to have supported her. He was recalled by Queen Mary on her accession, but he managed to retain her favour. In June 1554, he was sent to Brussels on a diplomatic mission, but was allowed to travel to Liege and Pau for his health. In June 1555, he was staying with Sir John Cheke at Padua, and went on from there to visit Sir John Masone, the English ambassador at Antwerp. He returned home in 1556.

==Personal life==
By 1540 he had married Elizabeth Stonor, daughter of Sir Walter Stonor of Stonor, Oxfordshire, widow of Sir William Compton and of Walter Walshe (d. 1538). They had no children.

Sir Philip died at his house in Blackfriars, London and was buried in Bisham Church where there is a fine effigial monument to him and his brother.

<doc id="422791" wikidata="Q6848224" url="?curid=422791" title="Mike O'Brien (British politician)">
<text>Michael O&#x27;Brien KC (born 19 June 1954) is a British lawyer and former Labour Party politician who was Member of Parliament (MP) for North Warwickshire from 1992 to 2010, serving in a number of ministerial posts.

==Early life==
Mike O&#x27;Brien attended state schools, a Roman Catholic primary school, St George&#x27;s and then later Blessed Edward Oldcorne School in Worcester. He studied for a BA in History and Politics at North Staffordshire Polytechnic, then gained a PGCE. From 1977 to 1980, he was a trainee solicitor, then trained as a teacher from 1980 to 1981. He lectured on business law at Colchester College of Further and Higher Education from 1981 to 1987. From 1987 to 1992, he practised as a solicitor specialising in criminal law, including cases of murder and City fraud, and acted for a major defendant in the Knightsbridge Security Deposit robbery. He became a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 2007. He now practises as a barrister at No5 Chambers in Birmingham.

==Parliamentary career==
O&#x27;Brien contested Ruislip Northwood in 1983, and North Warwickshire in 1987. He was elected as the Member of Parliament for the West Midlands constituency of North Warwickshire at the 1992 general election, defeating the Conservative incumbent Francis Maude.

He served on the Home Affairs Select Committee from November 1992 to May 1993 focusing on reports on Youth Justice and the defence of provocation in murder cases involving a spouse.

He was a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee which opened up scrutiny of the intelligence services by Parliament. This led to the first meeting of MPs and the head of MI5, then Stella Remington, and this later led to wider parliamentary scrutiny of the intelligence services.

The Home Affairs Committee also did a report on Domestic Violence, which focused on the extent of the problem. One of the strongest recommendations of the report was: &quot;The first priority for government action on domestic violence should be the establishment of a central, co-ordinated policy for refuge provision throughout the country. We believe that this could well be the single greatest cost-saving measure that could be taken&quot;. This led to an expansion in the number of refuges in the following decade. The report also focused on the effect of immigration law on victims of domestic violence and has been credited with supporting a feminist perspective on domestic violence. Influenced by evidence from Southall Black Sisters the report also raised awareness of the problems of domestic servants who faced deportation if they complained about being abused and this later led to changes in the immigration rules when Mike O&#x27;Brien became Immigration Minister.

Mike O&#x27;Brien introduced a Private Members Bill on 21 April 1993, the Criminal Justice Amendment (No.2) Bill, to allow previous convictions to be taken into account when sentencing a convicted person. This sought to amend the Criminal Justice Act 1991. The Government then accepted the principle and later amended the law.

In May 1993 he became the first Labour Parliamentary Adviser to the Police Federation of England and Wales in 20 years. He opposed cuts in Police Funding, criticising the then Home Secretary Michael Howard saying, &quot;I am appalled at how badly the Home Secretary …has handicapped the police and the fight against crime&quot;.

O&#x27;Brien subsequently transferred to the Treasury Select Committee where he worked on a report into the collapse of Barings Bank and other reports on City Fraud and Independence of the Bank of England

He clashed with Sir Robin Butler when the Treasury Select Committee investigated the impartiality of the civil service. He criticised the cabinet secretary for allowing himself to be used to investigate whether a Minister Secretary Jonathan Aitken had stayed at a Paris Hotel. &quot;Sir Robin was, at best, ill qualified to undertake any such investigation, as he did not in any previous incarnation have experience of being a policeman, a private investigator or a barrister trained in interrogation. He had none of the qualifications for playing the detective… Sir Robin Butler should not allow himself to be dragged into the gutter of partisan politics, nor should any civil servant. Some members of the Select Committee fear that impartiality has been undermined, and that should never happen again.&quot;

Mike O&#x27;Brien raised concerns in Parliament after the Matrix Churchill manufacturing plant in Coventry closed, calling on the government to &quot;ensure that those workers and their families are compensated for the loss of their livelihood&quot;.

As a member of Treasury Select Committee, he called for the director of the Serious Fraud Office &quot;to go&quot; and for an inquiry into the case of Roger Levitt.

In the May 2010 general election, O&#x27;Brien lost his North Warwickshire constituency to Dan Byles, the Conservative Party candidate by 54 votes.

===Minister of State for Immigration===
Mike O&#x27;Brien served as Parliamentary Under Secretary Minister of State for Immigration in the Home Office from 1997 till May 1999. 
Mike O&#x27;Brien, said that the last Conservative government left the immigration system in &quot;&quot;a complete shambles&quot; and it could take two years or more to process an application for asylum and &quot;we need to speed up the system. The deportation system is manifestly slow and cumbersome and produces inequity&quot;.&quot;

O&#x27;Brien described to a colleague the chaos he discovered in the department on being appointed as Immigration Minister: &quot;Once, on a visit to IND, he opened a cupboard and found it full of unanswered mail, having just been assured there were no more outstanding letters. A hapless junior official was summoned. His explanation? &#x27;We put them there so that the Minister wouldn&#x27;t see them&#x27;&quot;.

In October 1997, after consulting with lawyers from Stonewall, Mike O&#x27;Brien announced a change in UK immigration law allowing citizens to sponsor unmarried partners in 1997, including same-sex couples in this group. &quot;Under this concession, a couple must show that they have been living together for four years or more and intend to continue to live together permanently. Once admitted they will have to show that the relationship has subsisted for a further year before being granted settlement&quot;. In 1999, again consulting with Stonewall, he announced this was improved by reducing the required length of relationship to two years. This was the first step taken by the New Labour government toward equality for the LGBTQ community.

As a Home Office Minister responsible for race relations, Mike O&#x27;Brien worked with Jack Straw to set up the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry, meeting with the Lawrence family and their lawyers. He later endorsed the Macpherson Report in a book called &quot;Institutional Racism and the Police: Fact or Fiction?&quot; saying that, &quot;The Report is about securing the commitment of all of us to tackling racism, whether open or unwitting throughout our society, not just in the police force... The important thing for all of us is that Britain is a multiracial society. We have a choice whether to succeed as one or not. Racism in all its guises endangers and undermines the future success of our society; that is why to be racist in today&#x27;s multi-racial Britain is to be &#x27;un-British&#x27;.&quot;

Since 1992, the trend for net migration to the UK had been rising and continued till 1999. In 1997, annual net immigration stood at 56,000 but by 2001 net immigration had risen to 191,500.

In March 1998, Mike O&#x27;Brien told Parliament that in 1994, the previous administration had scrapped the &quot;embarkation checks for passengers travelling from ferry ports and small ports to destinations within the European Union; so, for four years, 40 per cent. of departing passengers have not been seen by an immigration officer…We inherited an embarkation control which serves little purpose in the tracking down of immigration offenders&quot; and therefore Mike O&#x27;Brien described the procedure of checking passports as &quot;routine and unproductive&quot; and said that &quot;Enhanced technology, such as closed circuit television, combined with close liaison between the border agencies, port operators and airlines, will create a stronger deterrent than the current immigration departure checks.&quot; The Immigration Service Union criticised the move, saying the changes made it harder to ensure that illegal immigrants ordered out of the country actually left.

In May 1998, Mike O&#x27;Brien announced that inhabitants of the island of Montserrat, which had been hit by volcanic eruptions, were able to stay in Britain indefinitely. O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s time as Minister of State for Immigration saw him deal with the late 1990s administrative problems including delays in officials giving clearance to NHS doctors and backlogs in processing applications for passports. The delays in issuing passports made national headlines and resulted in the UK Passport Agency being stripped of its Charter Mark for customer service.

Mike O&#x27;Brien also took through major reforms in the Immigration and Asylum Act, including introducing fines for hauliers found to have illegal migrants in their lorry, whether or not the haulier knew of their presence.

Responding to a debate on forced marriage on 10 February 1999, Mike O&#x27;Brien told MPs that &quot;…&quot;multicultural sensitivity is no excuse for official silence or moral blindness. We long ago abolished laws that treated women as chattels. We cannot shelter or tolerate bad practices under the guise of sensitivity&quot;.&quot; He announced a national dialogue on how to deal with forced marriage which led to the forced marriage unit run jointly by the Foreign Office and the Home Office.

Mike O&#x27;Brien developed the procedures for the creation of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (also known by the acronym SIAC) as a superior court of record in the United Kingdom established by the Special Immigration Appeals Commission Act 1997. SIAC deals with appeals from persons deported by the Home Secretary for reasons of national security or terrorism. It allows the security service to disclose confidential intelligence information to the court without disclosing its sources. Information and the source is disclosed to a special advocate who acts for the person but cannot disclose the source of information to either the person or their main lawyers. Speaking at the close of the committee stage of the bill, O&#x27;Brien said the law had, &quot;been governed by the terms of the European Court of Human Rights judgment in the case of Chahal. It is about creating the right balance between the liberty of the individual and the safety of the state.&quot;

====Hinduja affair====
Whilst serving as Minister of State for Immigration, O&#x27;Brien had to deal with the 2001 Hinduja affair. His testimony that Peter Mandelson had telephoned him on behalf of S P Hinduja, who was at the time seeking British citizenship, led to Mandelson&#x27;s resignation. An independent enquiry by Sir Anthony Hammond came to the conclusion that Mike O&#x27;Brien had acted correctly and neither Mandelson nor anyone else had acted improperly.

===Minister for Constitutional Affairs===
On 10 May 1999, Mike O&#x27;Brien became the Minister for Constitutional Affairs, taking through the Commons the Freedom of Information Act, The Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, two Representation of the People Acts and introduced a White Paper on Alcohol Licensing Reform.

As the Minister responsible for Race Relations, he developed the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 which placed obligations on all public bodies to promote good race relations. He also worked to develop closer links between the Government and the Muslim community, something he continued to work on over the next decade, particularly after 9/11.

He regularly spoke at Muslim community events and as the Minister for Race Relations in the Home Office he was responsible for building a dialogue between Muslim Groups and the Home Office. Later after becoming a Foreign office Minister and in the aftermath of 9/11, &quot;the FCO, led by Mike O&#x27;Brien, try to strengthen its relationship with the British Muslim community&quot; and this included sponsoring the British Haj delegation.
At a ministerial meeting, O&#x27;Brien joined Chris Mullin in warning the Prime Minister that his education reforms were &quot;hectoring&quot; teachers.

Mike O&#x27;Brien changed the rules so that cosmetics could not be tested on animals, but considered resigning after the Home Secretary refused to have an inquiry into animal rights complaints about Huntingdon Life Sciences.
In July 2000, Mike O&#x27;Brien became a &quot;have a go hero&quot; after he intercepted an alleged shoplifter being chased by a security guard, by sticking his leg out to trip him up as he ran past. Although the man ran off after a scuffle, he had dropped his car keys when he fell and police traced and arrested him. Mike O&#x27;Brien had broken his leg, but despite this went straight on to conduct a television interview. He was on crutches for six weeks. He said, &quot;It is something anyone would have done…they caught the man… so I was able to have some small sense of satisfaction.&quot;

On 21 December 2000 in the Deregulation (Sunday Dancing) Order 2000, Mike O&#x27;Brien ended the ban on any public dancing on a Sunday which had existed since the Sunday Observance Act 1780. He faced opposition to the move from the then Conservative MPs Theresa May and Philip Hammond. Scrapping the ban, O&#x27;Brien said: &quot;Our proposals will give freedom of choice for people as well as remove an unnecessary regulation on business. Be it line dancing, square dancing, ballroom or disco, it is plainly daft to have a ban on dancing because it is a Sunday.&quot;

In 2001 when the Government proposed to introduce ID cards, O&#x27;Brien wrote a pamphlet for &quot;Liberty&quot; attacking ID cards saying, &quot;Identity cards were abolished in the early fifties for good reasons. They were unreliable in proving identity and damaged the relationship between the public and the police. When it comes to fighting terrorism and serious crime, there are more effective things to spend our money on&quot;.

===Minister for the Middle East===
At the Foreign Office from 2002 to 2003 he was Minister for the Middle East. He went to Libya to hold the first meeting of a British Minister with Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi which opened the way to better relations between Gaddafi&#x27;s Libya and the West and helped lead to cooperation on ending controversial Libyan weapons research programmes.

In the run up to the Iraq War, he addressed parliament stating the Government&#x27;s position, saying: &quot;&quot;The body of evidence that Saddam Hussein possesses a fearsome range of weapons of mass destruction is substantial. The evidence comes from the UN reports, from Dr Blix, from our own intelligence and indeed from Saddam Hussein himself, who last night, oddly, admitted that the Iraqis had found a biological bomb and wanted to show us. Let us be clear: Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction and he is a threat to his people, his neighbours and ultimately the middle east and the wider world.&quot; &quot;The UN Security Council is in no doubt about that. That is why its resolution 1441 gave Saddam Hussein a final opportunity to comply with a string of legally binding obligations imposed on him over the past 12 years. Nearly four months later, Saddam Hussein has not taken that final opportunity. I cannot put the matter more crisply than Dr. Blix. He has reported that Iraq &quot;&quot;appears not to have come to a genuine acceptance . . . of the disarmament which was demanded of it&quot;. Before adding &quot;If we have to undertake military action and American and British troops are committed and have to go into Baghdad, I suspect that the Iraqi people will be the first to cheer.&quot;

Chris Mullin says that privately when Mullin asked for advice about what to say to Blair at an NEC meeting Mike O&#x27;Brien said, &quot;Tell him not to make any more promises to George Bush. Somewhere along the line he&#x27;s promised Bush that we will be there with him and now he can&#x27;t back down because his integrity is at stake&quot;.

In May 2003, Chris Mullin says Mike O&#x27;Brien intended to resign as a Foreign Office Minister over Iraq, &quot;Because I don&#x27;t believe what I am being asked to say about the existence of weapons of mass destruction. The Security Service is still saying they will be found, but I don&#x27;t believe them.&quot; Mullin, who opposed the war, convinced him to &quot;stay put&quot; because it was unnecessary &quot;self immolation&quot; to resign. Mike O&#x27;Brien was not criticised in the various reports into the Iraq war.

He was the first Western government minister into Baghdad after the Iraq War and worked on relationships with Iran, Syria and Afghanistan during this period.

O&#x27;Brien was sent by Tony Blair to meet President Assad in Damascus, to secure the release of two SAS soldiers picked up by Syrian security crossing the border, and was credited with the success.

Mike O&#x27;Brien was the Foreign Office Minister charged with negotiating Britain&#x27;s rapprochement with Libya in 2002 which led to Libya admitting responsibility for Lockerbie and paying compensation for victims, ending financial support for terrorism and an extensive chemical and nuclear weapons programme. &quot;…the Americans thought it was entirely pointless exercise. We took the view that it would produce beneficial results… it was a calculated risk… are MI6 people did a tremendous job and the foreign office deserves a lot of credit… The Americans were absolutely stunned by this.&quot;

Concerned by the abuse of human rights by the military leadership in Myanmar/Burma, O&#x27;Brien successfully ran a campaign to get British American Tobacco to withdraw its investments.

In December 2002, concerned by the human rights violations in Zimbabwe, O&#x27;Brien called upon the England Cricket Board to cancel the participation of the England team in the World Cup match in that country; but he rejected demands for compensation for the cost of cancellation. He said, &quot;We cannot order the ECB not to go to Zimbabwe, but we have asked them not to go&quot;. In February 2003, the England team confirmed it would not go to Zimbabwe.

===Minister of State for Trade and Industry===
He was then appointed Minister of State for Trade and Industry, dealing with talks with the WTO as part of the Doha Round and helping to write the 2004 Trade White Paper.

===Minister of State for Energy and e-Commerce===
Following a reshuffle, O&#x27;Brien became Minister of State for Energy and e-Commerce at the Department of Trade and Industry on 9 September 2004.

===Solicitor General for England and Wales===
Following the 2005 general election, O&#x27;Brien replaced Harriet Harman as Solicitor General for England and Wales.
Mike O&#x27;Brien had worked closely with the UK Jewish community to set up the first Holocaust Memorial Day in January 2001 and later in June 2005 he was asked to lead the British delegation to the OSCE Cordoba Conference on Anti-Semitism. Speaking at the conference he recalled, &quot;&quot;As Race Equality Minister I helped introduce national Holocaust Memorial Day each year which demonstrates our commitment to eternal vigilance against the rise of intolerance&quot;.&quot; and added that, &quot;The British Government has also promoted an inclusive concept of citizenship. It allows people to be British but to be individuals and express their cultural identity. Our aim is integration, not assimilation. We welcome migrants and expect them to integrate, but on the basis of respect for their own identity.&quot;

===Minister of State for Pensions===
On 29 June 2007, O&#x27;Brien was appointed as Minister of State for Pension Reform in the Department for Work and Pensions under Secretary of State Peter Hain. Referring to the long running Pensions Action Group campaign and speaking on the BBC Radio 4 &quot;Moneybox&quot; programme on the day compensation was announced, pensions expert Ros Altmann, credited Peter Hain and O&#x27;Brien with &quot;having been very different to deal with than their predecessors and ... willing and eager to engage and find a way to sort this out.&quot; The Pensions Act 2008 completed its major stages whilst O&#x27; Brien was minister and received Royal assent in November 2008.

===Minister of State for Energy and Climate Change===
On 5 October 2008, O&#x27;Brien became Minister of State at the new Department of Energy and Climate Change. He took through Parliament two Energy Acts making reforms to take account of the Climate Change debate and to enable the building of new nuclear power stations.

===Minister of State for Health===
In June 2009, he became the Minister of State for Health.
Through administrative reforms of the NHS in two Acts of Parliament he firmly rejected a study commissioned from consultancy firm McKinsey and Company by his ministerial predecessor, which had recommended 137,000 jobs would need to go to make NHS efficiency savings.

Mike O&#x27;Brien introduced priority NHS treatment for former service personnel injured in the line of duty and negotiated a settlement of compensation for the victims of thalidomide. Harold Evans, the former editor of the &quot;Observer&quot; who had helped expose the thalidomide scandal, said Mike O&#x27;Brien was one of the &quot;heroes for Justice&quot; in the thalidomide story, adding, &quot;On 14 January 2010 O&#x27;Brien made a dramatic announcement in Parliament. He apologised to the victims and their parents, but he also committed the government to give £20m to the Thalidomide Trust.&quot;

==After Parliament==
O&#x27;Brien was re-selected as Labour&#x27;s candidate in North Warwickshire for the 2015 general election in June 2013, but lost to the Conservative Party candidate Craig Tracey.

In June 2019, O&#x27;Brien unsuccessfully sought nomination as the Labour candidate in the 2020 election for West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner. There were four candidates on the Labour shortlist: himself, former Lord Mayor and Deputy West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner Yvonne Mosquito, a specialist housing and anti-social behaviour law solicitor Simon Foster, and a former assistant chief executive at Sandwell Council Melanie Dudley. Foster was chosen as Labour candidate and went on to win the election, which was deferred to 2021 owing to the covid pandemic.

<doc id="422792" wikidata="Q2301245" url="?curid=422792" title="Toronto Sun">
<text>The Toronto Sun is an English-language tabloid newspaper published daily in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The newspaper is one of several &quot;Sun&quot; tabloids published by Postmedia Network. The newspaper&#x27;s offices are located at Postmedia Place in downtown Toronto. 

The newspaper published its first edition in November 1971, after it had acquired the assets of the defunct &quot;Toronto Telegram&quot;, and hired portions of its staff. In 1978, Toronto Sun Holdings and Toronto Sun Publishing were consolidated to form Sun Publishing (later renamed Sun Media Corporation). Sun Publishing went on to form similar tabloids to the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; in other Canadian cities during the late 1970s and 1980s. The &quot;Sun&quot; was acquired by Postmedia Network in 2015, as a part of the sale of the &quot;Sun&quot;″s parent company, Sun Media.

== History ==

=== 20th century ===
In 1971, the Toronto Sun Publishing was created and purchased the syndication operations and newspaper vending boxes from the &quot;Toronto Telegram&quot;, which ceased operations in the same year. The Toronto Sun also recruited staff from the former &quot;Telegram&quot; conservative broadsheet newspaper, and published its first edition on 1 November 1971.

Publisher Doug Creighton was originally going to name the new newspaper the &quot;Toronto News&quot; but Andy Donato, who was asked to design the paper&#x27;s first front page and decided to call the paper the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; instead. Creighton decided it was too late to change it and renamed the paper.

The &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; was originally published out of leased space at the Eclipse White Wear Company Building at 322 King Street West. In 1975, the newspaper moved into the Toronto Sun Building at 333 King Street East which was eventually expanded to six storeys to house all of the newspaper&#x27;s operations. In 2010, the building was sold to property development company First Gulf, and the Sun consolidated its operations onto the second floor. It remained in the building until it relocated offices in 2016.

In 1978, Toronto Sun Holdings and Toronto Sun Publishing were consolidated to form Sun Publishing. The corporation expanded its tabloid footprint, having established its second tabloid, the &quot;Edmonton Sun&quot; through a partnership agreement with Edmonton Sun Publishing in 1978. The &quot;Albertan&quot; was acquired in 1980 and made into the company&#x27;s third tabloid, the &quot;Calgary Sun&quot; in 1980. 

In 1988, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described the &quot;Sun&quot; as an example of tabloid journalism.

=== 21st century ===
In 2004, the &quot;Sun&quot; began its annual George Gross/Toronto Sun Sportsperson of the Year award. By the mid-2000s, the word &quot;The&quot; was dropped from the paper&#x27;s name and the newspaper adopted its current logo.

The paper acquired a television station from Craig Media in 2005, which was renamed SUN TV. It was later transformed into the Sun News Network until its demise in 2015. 

As of the end of 2007, the &quot;Sun&quot; had a Monday through Saturday circulation of approximately 180,000 papers and Sunday circulation of 310,000.

The &quot;Sun&quot; was acquired by Postmedia in 2015, with its purchase of Sun Media from Quebecor. Following the acquisition the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; staff and operations moved to 365 Bloor Street East, the same building that houses the &quot;National Post&quot;, in March of 2016. However, the two newspapers maintain separate newsrooms.

== Circulation ==

The &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; has seen—like most Canadian daily newspapers—a decline in circulation. Its total circulation dropped by percent to 121,304 copies daily from 2009 to 2015.

He was formerly a Member of the United Kingdom Parliament (MP), representing Eddisbury. He was first elected in a by-election in July 1999, after Alastair Goodlad was made British High Commissioner in Australia by Tony Blair and thus had to leave Parliament. A member of the Conservative Party, within the Conservative-Liberal Democrat Coalition he was appointed as the Parliamentary Undersecretary of State in the Department for International Development. In September 2013 he became the Prime Minister&#x27;s Envoy to the Sahel, encompassing nine countries across North and West Africa.

==Early life==
He was born in Mtwara, Tanganyika Territory, and educated at Loretto School in Mombasa, at the Handbridge School (Chester), the Heronwater School (Abergele), Sedbergh School and Emmanuel College, Cambridge. At Cambridge, he gained an MA in Law in 1979, then obtained an MA from the College of Law in Chester in 1980. After two years, he qualified as a solicitor in 1983 and practised until 1988 at solicitors Freshfields (City of London). From 1988 to 1998, he was Group secretary and Director of Strategic and Corporate Affairs at Redland plc. He was the Executive Director of Redland Clay Tile in Mexico from 1994 to 1998. O&#x27;Brien is a former member of the Social Democratic Party (SDP).

==Parliamentary career==
He was Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development from May 2010 to September 2012. Prior to the May 2010 elections he was a Shadow Minister for Health. From May to December 2005, he served as the Shadow Minister for Skills. From November 2003 to 2005, he was Shadow Secretary of State for Industry. Previously, he held the post of Shadow Paymaster General and prior to that Shadow Financial Secretary. Before that, he was appointed an Opposition Whip in September 2001. From September 2000 to September 2001, he was Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Chairman of the Conservative Party, the Rt Hon Michael Ancram QC MP. From February to September 2000, he was Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Rt Hon Francis Maude MP.

O&#x27;Brien has also served as a member of the House of Commons Select Committee on Education and Employment and on the Education sub-Committee.
In addition, he has served as Secretary of the Conservative Northern Ireland Committee and Secretary of the Conservative Trade &amp; Industry Committee.

In 2001, he was appointed an Associate of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body. Prior to joining the Government, he was Chairman of the All Party Group on Malaria, also of Tanzania and Vice-Chairman of the All Party Aid Trade &amp; Debt Group.

In 2000, he introduced a Private Member&#x27;s Bill for Honesty in Food Labelling (country of origin and standards of production). From 1999, O&#x27;Brien has served on the Conservative Party&#x27;s National Membership Committee. Between 1995 and 1999, O&#x27;Brien was Chairman of the Public and Parliamentary Affairs Committee of BMP (National Council of Building Materials Producers, latterly the Construction Products Association) and sat on BMP&#x27;s Committee of Management and Strategy sub-committee. He was a trade member of the 1994 mission to Argentina and Brazil with the Rt Hon Sir Richard Needham MP (Minister for Trade). O&#x27;Brien was elected a member of the South East Regional Council of the CBI, serving between 1995 and 1998, and sat on the CBI&#x27;s International Investment Committee and Working Parties on Anti-Corruption (pan-European) and Corporate Governance (UK).

On 7 March 2013 O&#x27;Brien was appointed to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom.

== UN career ==
O&#x27;Brien was appointed Undersecretary General for Humanitarian Affairs, the top position at OCHA, on 9 March 2015.

In January 2016, 112 doctors, humanitarian workers, and civil society members in Syria addressed an open letter to O&#x27;Brien criticizing OCHA for failing to meet urgent humanitarian needs created by the Syrian Civil War, citing a report by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon which stated that the combined food, medical aid (insulin), and non-food items to successfully delivered to besieged areas in Syria in 2015 was enough for only 0.7% of the UN&#x27;s estimated 212,000 people living under siege.

O&#x27;Brien said in a note to correspondents that his office pledged to engage besieged populations and would continue to work tirelessly to bring lifesaving aid to those in need in Syria.

In March 2016, O&#x27;Brien assumed management of the upcoming World Humanitarian Summit, an initiative of the Secretary-General. In an op-ed about the summit, O&#x27;Brien wrote: &quot;To end need, we must stop thinking about relief and development as a sequence. Instead, we must find new ways to comprehensively reduce vulnerability and risk while in tandem meeting pressing humanitarian needs in line with humanitarian principles.&quot;

O&#x27;Brien was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 2017 Birthday Honours for services to the United Nations and humanitarian affairs.

==Personal life==
He married Gemma Townshend, a nurse, on 30 August 1986 in Bromley, Kent. They have two sons (born July 1988 and August 1990) and a daughter (born January 1993). They live near Tarporley.

==Early life==
Born in the historic market town of Pontefract, West Riding of Yorkshire, O&#x27;Brien was previously a miner from 1946 to 1983 and local councillor on Wakefield Council from 1973 to 1983. He stood unsuccessfully for the post of Secretary for the Yorkshire region of the National Union of Mineworkers in 1973, losing to Owen Briscoe from the Yorkshire Left group.

<text>William O&#x27;Brien (2 October 1852 – 25 February 1928) was an Irish nationalist, journalist, agrarian agitator, social revolutionary, politician, party leader, newspaper publisher, author and Member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. He was particularly associated with the campaigns for land reform in Ireland during the late 19th and early 20th centuries as well as his conciliatory approach to attaining Irish Home Rule.

==Family, education==

William O&#x27;Brien was born at Bank Place in Mallow, County Cork, as the second son of James O&#x27;Brien, a solicitor&#x27;s clerk, and his wife Kate, the daughter of James Nagle, a local shopkeeper. On his mother&#x27;s side, he was descended from the distinguished Norman family of Nagles, long settled in the vicinity of Mallow giving their name to the nearby Nagle Mountains. He was also linked through his mother with the statesman Edmund Burke&#x27;s mother&#x27;s family, as well as with the poet Edmund Spenser&#x27;s family. The Nagles however, no longer held the status or prosperity they once had. In the same month thirty-eight years earlier Thomas Davis was born in Mallow. O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s advocacy of the cause of Irish Independence was to be in the same true tradition of his esteemed fellow townsman. Following in his footsteps he acknowledged the existence of many strands of Irishness.

O&#x27;Brien shared his primary education with a townsman with whom he was later to have a close political connection, Canon Sheehan of Doneraile. He enjoyed his secondary education at the Cloyne diocesan college, which resulted in his being brought up in an environment noted for its religious tolerance. He greatly valued having had this experience from an early age, which strongly influenced his later views on the need for such tolerance in Irish national life.

==Early journalism==
Financial misfortune in 1868 caused the O&#x27;Brien family to move to Cork City. A year later his father died, and the illness of his elder and younger brother and his sister resulted in him having to support his mother and siblings. Always a prolific writer, it quickly earned him a job as a newspaper reporter, first for the &quot;Cork Daily Herald&quot;. This was to be the primary career which first attracted attention to him as a public figure. He had begun legal studies at Queen&#x27;s College, later University College Cork, but although he never graduated, he held a lifelong attachment to the institution, to which he bequeathed his private papers.

==Political origins==
From an early age O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s political ideas, like most of his contemporaries, were shaped by the Fenian movement and the plight of the Irish tenant farmers, his elder brother having participated in the rebellion of 1867. It resulted in O&#x27;Brien himself becoming actively involved with the Fenian brotherhood, resigning in the mid-1870s, because of what he described in &#x27;Evening Memories&#x27; (p. 443–4) as &quot;the gloom of inevitable failure and horrible punishment inseparable from any attempt at separation by force of arms&quot;.

As a journalist, his attention was attracted in the first place to the suffering of the tenant farmers. Now on the staff of the &quot;Freeman&#x27;s Journal&quot;, after touring the Galtee Mountains around Christmas 1877 he published articles describing their conditions. They are generally acknowledged as the earliest example of investigative journalism in Ireland. They later appeared in pamphlet form. With this action, he first displayed his belief that only through parliamentary reform and with the new power of the press that public opinion could be influenced to pursue Irish issues constitutionally through open political activity and the ballot box. Not least of all, responding to the hopes of the new Irish Home Rule movement.

==United Ireland Editor==

In 1878 he met Charles Stewart Parnell MP at a Home Rule meeting. Parnell recognised his exceptional talents as a journalist and writer, influencing his rise to becoming a leading politician of the new generation. He subsequently appointed him in 1881 as editor of the Irish National Land League&#x27;s journal, &quot;United Ireland&quot;. His association with Parnell and the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) led to his arrest and imprisonment with Parnell, Dillon, William Redmond and other nationalist leaders in Kilmainham Gaol that October.

During his imprisonment until April 1882 he drafted the famous Land War &quot;No Rent Manifesto&quot; – a rent-withholding scheme personally led by O&#x27;Brien, escalating the conflict between the Land League and Gladstone&#x27;s government.

==Agitator and MP==
From 1883 to 1885 O&#x27;Brien was elected MP for Mallow. Following the abolition of that constituency he represented Tyrone South from 1885 to 1886, North East Cork from 1887 to 1892, and Cork City from 1892 to 1895 and from 1901 to 1918, in the House of Commons. There were three periods of absence: 1886–7, from 1895 to 1900, and eight months in 1904. Amid the turmoil of Irish politics in the late 19th century he was frequently arrested and imprisoned for his support for various Land League protests.

In 1884, through the newspaper &quot;United Ireland&quot; he incited a sensational homosexual scandal involving officers at Dublin Castle.

In 1887 O&#x27;Brien helped to organise a rent strike with John Mandeville during the Plan of Campaign at the estate of Lady Kingston near Mitchelstown, County Cork. On 9 September, after an 8,000-strong demonstration led by John Dillon MP, three estate tenants were shot dead, and others wounded, by police at the town&#x27;s courthouse where O&#x27;Brien had been brought for trial with Mandeville on charges of incitement under a new Coercion Act. This event became known as the Mitchelstown Massacre. Later that year, thousands of demonstrators marched in London to demand his release from prison and clashed with police at Trafalgar Square on Bloody Sunday (13 November).
Even in prison, O&#x27;Brien continued his protests, refusing to wear prison uniform in 1887. Being left without clothes, a Blarney tweed suit was smuggled in. He occasionally wore this much-publicised suit in the Commons when confronting his incarcerator, Arthur Balfour. His imprisonment also inspired protests – notably the 1887 &#x27;Bloody Sunday&#x27; riots in London. In 1889 he escaped from a courtroom but was sentenced &quot;in absentia&quot; for conspiracy. He fled to America accompanied by Dillon who was on bail, then to France where both held negotiations with Parnell at Boulogne-sur-Mer over the leadership of the party. When these broke down, both returned to Folkestone giving themselves up, subsequently serving four months in Clonmel and Galway gaols. Here O&#x27;Brien began to reconsider his political future, having already been prosecuted nine times over the years, using the time to write an acclaimed novel, a Fenian romance with a land reform theme set in 1860: &quot;When We Were Boys&quot;, which was published in 1890.

==Marriage, reorientation==
In 1890 he married Sophie Raffalovich, sister of the poet Marc André Sebastian Raffalovich and the economist Arthur Raffalovich, and daughter of the Russian Jewish banker, Hermann Raffalowich, domiciled in Paris. It was to mark a major turning point in O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s personal and political life. His wife brought considerable wealth into the marriage, enabling him to act with political independence and providing finances to establish his own newspapers. His wife (1860–1960) who survived him by over 30 years, gave him considerable moral and emotional support for his political pursuits. Their relationship added to his life an abiding love for France and attachment to Europe, where he often retired to recuperate.

By 1891 he had become disillusioned with Parnell&#x27;s political leadership, although emotionally loyal to him he tried to persuade him to retire after the O&#x27;Shea divorce case. On Parnell&#x27;s death that year and the ensuing IPP split, he remained aloof from aligning himself with either faction, either the rump Parnellite Irish National League (INL) led by John Redmond MP or with the anti-Parnellite Irish National Federation (INF) group under John Dillon, although he saw the weight of strength in the latter. O&#x27;Brien worked hard in the 1893 negotiations leading to the passage by the Commons of Gladstone&#x27;s Second Home Rule Bill; however, the Bill was rejected by the Lords.

==United Irish League==
Distancing himself from the party turmoils, he retired from Parliament in 1895, settling for a while with his wife near Westport, County Mayo, which enabled him to experience at first-hand from his Mayo retreat the distressed hardship of the peasantry in the West of Ireland, trying to eke out an existence in its rocky landscape.

Believing strongly that agitational politics combined with constitutional pressures were the best means of achieving objectives, O&#x27;Brien established on the 16. January 1898 the United Irish League (UIL) at Westport, with Michael Davitt as co-founder and John Dillon present. It was to be a new grass-roots organisation with a programme to include agrarian agitation, political reform and Home Rule. It coincided with the passing of the revolutionary Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 which broke the power of the landlord-dominated &quot;Grand Juries&quot;, passing for the first time absolute democratic control of local affairs into the hands of the people through elected Local County Councils.

The UIL was explicitly designed to reconcile the various parliamentary fragments existing since the Parnell split, which proved very popular, its branches sweeping over most of the country organised by its general secretary John O&#x27;Donnell, dictating to the demoralised Irish party leaders the terms for reconstruction, not only of the party but the nationalist movement in Ireland. The movement was backed by O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s new newspaper &quot;The Irish People&quot;.

Around 1900 O&#x27;Brien, an unbending social reformer and agrarian agitator, was the most influential and powerful figure within the nationalist movement, although not formally its leader. His UIL was by far the largest organisation in the country, comprising 1150 branches and 84,355 members. The result of the rapid growth of his UIL as a national organisation in achieving unity through organised popular opinion, was to effect a quick defensive reunion of the discredited IPP factions of the INL and the INF, largely fearing O’Brien&#x27;s return to the political field. He can nevertheless be regarded as the architect of the settlement of 1900. The unity under John Redmond disturbed O’Brien, as it resulted in most of the ineffective party candidates being re-elected in the 1900 general election, preventing the UIL from using its power in the pre-selection of candidates. Within a few years, the IPP was, however, to tactically adjunct the UIL under its wing manoeuvering it out of O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s control.

==Land Act architect==
O&#x27;Brien next intensified the UIL agitation for land purchase by tenant farmers, pressing for compulsory purchase. He formed an alliance with constructive unionists which resulted in the calling of the December 1902 Land Conference, an initiative by moderate landlords led by Lord Dunraven for a settlement by conciliatory agreement between landlord and tenant. The tenant representation was led by O&#x27;Brien, the others were John Redmond, Timothy Harrington and T. W. Russell for the Ulster tenants. After six sittings all eight tenants&#x27; demands were conceded (one with compromise), O’Brien having guided the official nationalist movement into endorsement of a new policy of &quot;conference plus business&quot;. He followed this by campaigning vigorously for the greatest piece of social legislation Ireland had yet seen, orchestrating the Land Purchase (Ireland) Act 1903 through parliament, which effectively ended landlordism, solving the age-old Irish Land Question.

The Act&#x27;s agreement on land purchase between tenants and landlords resulted in a rush of landlords to sell and of tenants to buy. Though the Act was approved by Redmond, his deputy Dillon disliked the Act because he opposed any co-operation with landlords, while Michael Davitt objected to peasant proprietorship under the Act, demanding land nationalisation. Together with Thomas Sexton editor of the party&#x27;s &quot;Freeman&#x27;s Journal&quot;, all three campaigned against O’Brien, fiercely attacking him for putting Land Purchase and Conciliation before Home Rule. O&#x27;Brien appealed to Redmond to suppress their opposition but his call went unheeded. Declaring that he was making no headway with his policy, he resigned his Parliamentary seat in November 1903, closed down his paper the &quot;Irish People&quot; and left the party for the next five years. It was a serious setback for the party. It also turned once intimate friends into mortal enemies. His Cork electorate, however, insisted on pushing through his re-election eight months later in August 1904. O’Brien had failed in his intention of shocking the party to its senses.

During 1904 O&#x27;Brien had already embarked on advancing full-scale implementation of the Act in alliance with D. D. Sheehan MP and his Irish Land and Labour Association (ILLA) when they formed the Cork Advisory Committee to help tenants in their negotiations. Their collaboration became the new organisational base for O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s political activities. This new alliance aggravated the Dillonite section of the IPP further. Determined to destroy both of them &quot;before they poison the whole country&quot;, Dillon and the party published regular denunciations in the &quot;Freeman&#x27;s Journal&quot;, then coupéd O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s UIL with the appointment of its new secretary, Dillon&#x27;s chief lieutenant, Joseph Devlin MP, Grandmaster of the Ancient Order of Hibernians, Devlin eventually gaining organisational control over the entire UIL and IPP organisations.

O&#x27;Brien had in the meantime engaged with the Irish Reform Association, together with Sir Anthony MacDonnell, a Mayo Catholic originally appointed by Wyndham, and head of the Civil Service in Dublin Castle, anxious to do something for Ireland. MacDonnell helped the reform group to draft a scheme on the possible extension of the principle of self-government for Ireland. On 31 August 1904 the Reform Association released a preliminary report calling for the devolution of larger powers of local government for Ireland. The limited scheme was quickly and equally condemned by O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s opponents, who regarded it nevertheless as a step in the right direction.

==Macroom programme==
After the financing of tenant land purchase, tenant farmers were now proud proprietors largely in control of local government. The next issue was to provide extensive rural housing for the tens of thousands of migrant farm labourers struggling to survive in stone cabins, barns or mud hovels. This was a long-standing demand by the ILLA branches and D.D. Sheehan. In 1904 O&#x27;Brien then joined forces with Sheehan&#x27;s ILLA organisation, identifying himself with labourer&#x27;s grievances and Sheehan&#x27;s demand for agricultural labourers&#x27; housing, who up to then were dependent on limited provision of cottages by local County Councils or landowners at unfavourable terms.

Following large demonstrations addressed by O’Brien and his friends during 1904 which fought and won the field in Charleville and Macroom (County Cork), Kilfinane and Dromcolliher (County Limerick), Tralee and Castleisland (County Kerry), Scariff (County Clare), Goolds Cross (County Tipperary) and Ballycullane (County Wexford), a breakthrough occurred when a scheme was made public at &quot;the largest labour demonstration ever held in Ireland&quot; (&quot;Cork Examiner&quot;), a memorable rally in Macroom on Sunday 11 December 1904 addressed by William O&#x27;Brien. Preaching a gospel of social justice, his concepts became known as the &#x27;Macroom programme&#x27;. O&#x27;Brien grasped the prime importance of its principles and measures when during 1905 he pressed and negotiated together with support from Sir Anthony MacDonnell (the Under-Secretary for Ireland) for what was subsequently carried into law and after the January 1906 general election became the ground-breaking Bryce &quot;Labourers (Ireland) Act (1906)&quot;.

==Housing drive==

The second phase of the Labourers Acts (1906–1914) began after the 1906 Labourers Housing Act, long demanded by the ILLA, was implemented, for which both the Redmondite and O&#x27;Brienite factions were zealous in claiming credit. The labourer-owned cottages erected by the Local County Councils brought about a major socio-economic transformation, by simultaneously erasing the previous inhuman habitations. O&#x27;Brien saying that the Labourers Acts – &quot;were scarcely less wonderworking than the abolition of landlordism itself&quot;. In 1904 Davitt going so far as to declare the foreseen Labourers Act constituted – &quot;a rational principle of state Socialism&quot;. This Act had enormous positive long-term consequences for rural Irish society.

The so-called &#x27;Labourers Act&#x27; provided large-scale funding for extensive state-sponsored housing to accommodate rural labourers and others of the working classes. The programme financed and produced during the course of the next five years, the erection of over 40,000 working-class cottages, each on an acre of land, a complete &#x27;municipalisation&#x27; of commodious dwellings dotting the rural Irish countryside. This unique social housing programme unparalleled anywhere else in Europe brought about an unsurpassed agrarian revolution, changing the face of the Irish landscape, much to O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s expressed delight. 
Renewed publication of O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s newspaper &quot;The Irish People&quot; (1905–1909) exalting the cottage building, its editorials equally countermanding the IPPs&#x27; &quot;Dublin bosses&quot; attempts to curtail the programme, fearing settled rural communities would no longer be dependent on Party and Church. Munster took full advantage, erecting most of the cottages, and additional funding provided for a further 5,000 houses under Birrell&#x27;s . The bulk of the labourers&#x27; cottages were erected by 1916, resulting in a widespread decline of rampant tuberculosis, typhoid and scarlet fever.

==Turbulent times==
In the interest of political unity, O&#x27;Brien and other excluded MPs temporarily rejoined the Parliamentary Party when Redmond summoned a unity meeting in the Mansion House, Dublin in April 1908. Later that year, during negotiations for additional funding of land purchase under an amending bill, Redmond called a further UIL National Convention for 9 February 1909 in Dublin to regulate the issues, claiming the bill over-burdened the British Treasury and the ratepayers. Over 3000 delegates attended. Devlin had the hall filled in advance with forces of his &quot;militant Mollies&quot;, so that when O&#x27;Brien and his followers tried to speak in favour of the bill, they were battened into silence. The convention was then dubbed the &#x27;Baton&#x27; Convention by O&#x27;Brien. It was &quot;probably the stormiest meeting ever held by constitutional nationalists&quot;.

The bill eventually passed into law as Birrell&#x27;s &quot;Land Purchase Act (1909)&quot;, but fell far short in its financial provisions.

As an outcome of the &quot;Baton Convention&quot; O’Brien felt himself again driven from the party. He foresaw that the IPP, undermined by the AOH, was on a fatal radical path which would frustrate any All-Ireland Home Rule settlement. As a countermeasure, he set about establishing a new League, which was to build on the success his combined &quot;doctrine of conciliation&quot; with &quot;conference plus business&quot; achieved during the 1902 Land Conference with landlords and the ensuing 1903 Land Purchase Act. Following his engagement with the Irish Reform Movement 1904-5 and support of the 1907 Irish Council Bill which he viewed as a step in the right direction, or &quot;Home Rule by instalments&quot;, he firmly believed all moderate unionists could still be won over to All-Ireland Home Rule. For many nationalists on the other hand, the adoption of a conciliatory approach to the &quot;hereditary enemy&quot; involved too sharp a deviation from traditional thinking.

==All-for-Ireland League==
In March 1909 he inaugurated the All-for-Ireland League (AFIL) in Kanturk with James Gilhooly MP as Chairman and D. D. Sheehan Hon. Secretary. The AFIL&#x27;s political objective was the attainment of an All-Ireland parliament with the consent rather than by the compulsion of the Protestant and Unionist community, under the banner of the &quot;Three Cs&quot;, for Conference, Conciliation and Consent as applied to Irish politics. The League was supported by many prominent Protestant gentry, leading landlords and Munster business figures. The political activist Canon Sheehan of Doneraile was also a founder member and wrote in a very long editorial for the first issue of the League&#x27;s new newspaper its political manifesto.

Ill-health striking O’Brien, he departed for Florence, Italy to recuperate, returning for the January 1910 general election, in which the Cork electorate returned eight &quot;O&#x27;Brienite&quot; MPs. Throughout 1910 his AFIL movement opposed an Irish Party supported by the Catholic clergy. It returned eight independent AFIL MPs in the December 1910 general election to be O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s new political party. From July 1910 until late 1916 O’Brien published the League&#x27;s newspaper, the &quot;Cork Free Press&quot;. Election results published by it showed Independents throughout Ireland had won 30% of votes cast.

O’Brien saw it opportune for a cooperative understanding with Arthur Griffith&#x27;s moderate Sinn Féin movement, having in common – attaining objectives through &quot;moral protest&quot; – political resistance and agitation rather than militant physical-force. Neither O’Brien nor Griffith advocated total abstentionism from the Commons, and regarded Dominion Home Rule, modelled on Canada or Australia, as acceptable. Although Griffith favoured cooperation, a special Sinn Feín executive council meeting called to consider cooperation regretted it was not possible because its constitution would not allow it. In the following years O’Brien and his party continued to associate themselves with Griffith&#x27;s movement both in and out of parliament. In June 1918 Griffith asked O’Brien to have the writ moved for his candidacy in the Cavan-east by-election (moved by AFIL MP Eugene Crean) to which Griffith was elected with a sizeable majority.

==Home Rule stance==
On 2 November 1911 O&#x27;Brien proposed full Dominion status similar to that enjoyed by Canada, in an exchange of views with Asquith, as the only viable solution to the &quot;Irish Question&quot;. Home Rule became technically assured after a new Home Rule bill was introduced in 1912 with the IPP holding the balance of power at Westminster. During the 1913–14 Parliamentary debates on the Third Home Rule Bill, O&#x27;Brien, alarmed by Unionist resistance to the bill, opposed the IPP&#x27;s coercive &quot;Ulster must follow&quot; policy, and published in the &quot;Cork Free Press&quot; end of January 1914 specific concession, including a suspensory veto right, which would enable Ulster join a Dublin Parliament &quot;any price for an United Ireland, but never partition&quot;. William O&#x27;Brien resigned his seat as MP again for a fourth time in January and re-stood to test local support for his policies after the All-for-Ireland League suffered heavy defeats in the Cork City municipal elections.

After the opening of Parliament in February 1914 the threat of rebellion in Ulster gave O&#x27;Brien the opportunity to make an eloquent speech on 24 February calling for generous concessions towards Ulster, but warning he would &#x27;strenuously oppose exclusion&#x27;. When the Ulster Volunteers armed in April to resist likely &quot;Rome Rule&quot;, Redmond&#x27;s Irish Volunteers armed likewise to ensure enactment of all-Ireland self-government. During the final stages of the second reading and debate on the Third Home Rule Bill in the House of Commons, which was accompanied by Asquith&#x27;s guarantee that it would never be enforced without an Amending Bill enacting the exclusion of the six Ulster counties with a Protestant majority, O&#x27;Brien made a powerful lengthy speech on 1 April 1914 reiterating at length his proposals to enable Ulster to remain within an All-Ireland settlement, by means of a suspensory veto upon any bill passed by a Dublin Parliament, amongst other rights and protections. Stating &quot;I condemn and abhor with all my heart the preparations of the Ulster Volunteers for even the possibility of slaughter between Irishmen and Irishmen&quot;. Otherwise, Ireland once divided would remain divided and &#x27;the line on which you are presently travelling will never bring you anything except division and disaster&#x27;.

Opposing O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s proposals and initiatives, the Redmond-Dillon-Devlin (IPP-UIL-AOH) hardline alliance remained uncompromising with their standpoint – &quot;no concessions for Ulster&quot;. In the Commons on 25 May O&#x27;Brien stated that &quot;we are ready for almost any conceivable concession to Ulster that will have the effect of uniting Ireland, but we will struggle to our last breath against a proposal which will divide her, and divide her eternally, if Ireland&#x27;s own representatives are once consenting parties . . .&quot; O&#x27;Brien and his followers held true to their pledge and abstained from the final vote passing the Government of Ireland Act 1914, denouncing the bill as a &quot;ghastly farce&quot; and ultimately as a &quot;partition deal&quot; after Sir Edward Carson, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party forced through an amendment mandating the partition of Ireland. The Irish Nationalists&#x27; confrontation course with Ulster had ended in a fiasco.

With the outbreak and involvement on 4 August 1914 of Ireland in World War I, Asquith proposed a Suspensory Bill for the Home Rule Bill. It received Royal Assent simultaneously with its counterpart, the Government of Ireland Act 1914, on 18 September. Although the two controversial Bills had now finally reached the statute books, the Suspensory Act ensured that Home Rule would be postponed for the duration of the conflict. In the debate on 15 September in the House of Commons concerning the Suspensory Bill, O&#x27;Brien made it again clear &quot;that while we are prepared to pay almost any other price for a general national settlement, there is one price which some of us, at all events, will never in any possible circumstances consent to pay, and that is the dismemberment of our ancient Irish nation&quot;. He concluded by turning to &#x27;our fellow countrymen in Ulster&#x27; in proposing to secure for them a position of undiminished citizenship in this Empire under some projected scheme of federalism.

==Last crusade==
O&#x27;Brien saw the outbreak of World War I in August as an opportunity to undertake a last crusade to preserve at any price the unity of Ireland, by uniting the Green and Orange in a common cause, declaring himself on the side of the Allied and Britain&#x27;s European war effort. O&#x27;Brien was the first Nationalist leader to call on Irish Volunteers for the front. Towards the end of August, he had an interview with Lord Kitchener, Secretary of State for War, and laid before him a scheme for raising an Irish Army Corps embracing all classes and creeds, South and North. Kitchener (incidentally a Protestant and born in County Kerry) favoured the idea. O’Brien immediately summoned a meeting held in the Cork Town Hall under the auspices of the All-for-Ireland League on 2 September, the hall packed with an enthusiastic audience of men and women. In a speech that far exceeded Redmond&#x27;s in favour of its adherence to England&#x27;s cause, he said:- :

O&#x27;Brien later wrote: &quot;Whether Home Rule is to have a future will depend upon the extent to which the Nationalists in combination with Ulster Covenanters, do their part in the firing line on the fields of France&quot;. He stood on recruiting platforms with the other National leaders and spoke out encouragingly in favour of voluntary enlistment in the Royal Munster Fusiliers and other Irish regiments.

==Changing tides==
O&#x27;Brien, alarmed at the increased activity of Sinn Féin in 1915, predicted the danger of a potential republican eruption, culminating in the IRB 1916 Rebellion, in which however Sinn Féin were not involved. He was forced to cease publication of his &quot;Cork Free Press&quot; in 1916 soon after the appointment of Lord Decies as Chief Press Censor for Ireland. Decies warned the press to be careful about what they published. Such warnings had little effect when dealing with such papers as the &quot;Cork Free Press&quot;. It was suppressed after its republican editor, Frank Gallagher, accused the British authorities of lying about the conditions and situation of republican prisoners in the Frongoch internment camp.
O&#x27;Brien accepted the Rising and the ensuing changed political climate in 1917 as the best way of ridding the country of IPP and AOH stagnation. Home Rule had been lost in 1913, an inflexible IPP long out of touch with reality, reflected by Britain&#x27;s two failed attempts to introduce Home Rule in 1916 and again in 1917. O&#x27;Brien refused to participate in the Irish Convention after southern unionist representatives he had proposed were turned down. During the Convention Redmond belatedly adopted O’Brien&#x27;s policy of accommodating Unionist opposition both from the North and from the South. But it was ten years too late. Had he joined O’Brien earlier and carried the Irish Party with him, it is probable that Ireland&#x27;s destiny would have been settled by evolution. The Convention ended in failure as O&#x27;Brien predicted when Britain attempted to link the enactment of Home Rule with conscription.

During the anti-conscription crisis in April 1918 O&#x27;Brien and his AFIL left the House of Commons and joined Sinn Féin and other prominentaries in the mass protests in Dublin. Seeing no future for his conciliatory political concepts in a future election, he believed Sinn Féin in its moderate form had earned the right to represent nationalist interests. He and the other members of his All-for-Ireland League party stood aside putting their seats at the disposal of Sinn Féin, whose candidates returned unopposed in the December 1918 general elections. In an address to the election he had said: &quot;We cannot subscribe to a programme of armed resistance in the field, or even of permanent withdrawal from Westminster; but to the spirit of Sinn Féin, as distinct from its abstract programme, the great mass of independent single-minded Irishmen have been won over, and accordingly they ought now to have a full and sympathetic trial for enforcing the Irish nation&#x27;s right of self-determination.&quot;

O&#x27;Brien disagreed with the establishment of a southern Irish Free State under the Treaty, still believing that Partition of Ireland was too high a price to pay for partial independence. He wrote in 1923, &quot;It is now obvious enough that, had the Irish Council Bill been allowed to pass in 1907, the Partition of Ireland would never have been heard of.&quot; Retiring from political life, he contented himself with writing and declined Éamon de Valera&#x27;s offer to stand for Fianna Fáil in the 1927 general election. He died suddenly on 25 February 1928 while on a visit to London with his wife at the age of 75. His remains rest in Mallow, and one of the principal streets in the town bears his name to this day, as does Great William O&#x27;Brien Street in Cork. His head-bust overlooks the town Council&#x27;s Chamber Room and a portrait of O&#x27;Brien hangs in University College Cork. 

In 1920 Arthur Griffith said of O&#x27;Brien:&quot; &quot;The task of William O’Brien&#x27;s generation was well and bravely done, had it not been so the work we are carrying out in this generation would have been impossible. In that great work none of Parnell&#x27;s lieutenants did so much as William O’Brien.&quot; &quot;

<text>The G1 phase, gap 1 phase, or growth 1 phase, is the first of four phases of the cell cycle that takes place in eukaryotic cell division. In this part of interphase, the cell synthesizes mRNA and proteins in preparation for subsequent steps leading to mitosis. G1 phase ends when the cell moves into the S phase of interphase. Around 30 to 40 percent of cell cycle time is spent in the G1 phase.

== Overview ==

G1 phase together with the S phase and G2 phase comprise the long growth period of the cell cycle cell division called interphase that takes place before cell division in mitosis (M phase).

During G1 phase, the cell grows in size and synthesizes mRNA and protein that are required for DNA synthesis. Once the required proteins and growth are complete, the cell enters the next phase of the cell cycle, S phase. The duration of each phase, including the G1 phase, is different in many different types of cells. In human somatic cells, the G1 stage of the cell cycle lasts about 10 hours. However, in Xenopus embryos, sea urchin embryos, and Drosophila embryos, the G1 phase is barely existent and is defined as the gap, if one exists, between the end of mitosis and the S phase.

G1 phase and the other subphases of the cell cycle may be affected by limiting growth factors such as nutrient supply, temperature, and room for growth. Sufficient nucleotides and amino acids must be present in order to synthesize mRNA and proteins. Physiological temperatures are optimal for cell growth. In humans, the normal physiological temperature is around 37 °C (98.6 °F).

G1 phase is particularly important in the cell cycle because it determines whether a cell commits to division or to leaving the cell cycle. If a cell is signaled to remain undivided, instead of moving onto the S phase, it will leave the G1 phase and move into a state of dormancy called the G0 phase. Most nonproliferating vertebrate cells will enter the G0 phase.

== Regulation ==

Within the cell cycle, there is a stringent set of regulations known as the cell cycle control system that controls the timing and coordination of the phases to ensure a correct order of events. Biochemical triggers known as cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) switch on cell cycles events at the corrected time and in the correct order to prevent any mistakes.

There are three checkpoints in the cell cycle: the G1/S Checkpoint or the Start checkpoint in yeast; the G2/M checkpoint; and the spindle checkpoint.

===Biochemical regulators===
During G1 phase, the G1/S cyclin activity rises significantly near the end of the G1 phase.

Complexes of cyclin that are active during other phases of the cell cycle are kept inactivated to prevent any cell-cycle events from occurring out of order. Three methods of preventing Cdk activity are found in G1 phase: pRB binding to E2F family transcription factors downregulate expression of S phase cyclin genes; anaphase-promoting complex (APC) is activated, which targets and degrades S and M cyclins (but not G1/S cyclins); and a high concentration of Cdk inhibitors is found during G1 phase.

===Restriction point===

The restriction point (R) in the G1 phase is different from a checkpoint because it does not determine whether cell conditions are ideal to move on to the next phase, but it changes the course of the cell. After a vertebrate cell has been in the G1 phase for about three hours, the cell enters a restriction point in which it is decided whether the cell will move forward with the G1 phase or move into the dormant G0 phase.

This point also separates two halves of the G1 phase; the post-mitotic and pre-mitotic phases. Between the beginning of the G1 phase (which is also after mitosis has occurred) and R, the cell is known as being in the G1-pm subphase, or the post-mitotic phase. After R and before S, the cell is known as being in G1-ps, or the pre S phase interval of the G1 phase.

In order for the cell to continue through the G1-pm, there must be a high amount of growth factors and a steady rate of protein synthesis, otherwise the cell will move into G0 phase.

==== Conflicting research ====
Some authors will say that the restriction point and the G1/S checkpoint are one and the same, but more recent studies have argued that there are two different points in the G1 phase that check the progression of the cell. The first restriction point is growth-factor dependent and determines whether the cell moves into the G0 phase, while the second checkpoint is nutritionally-dependent and determines whether the cell moves into the S phase.

===The G1/S checkpoint===

The G1/S checkpoint is the point between G1 phase and the S phase in which the cell is cleared for progression into the S phase. Reasons the cell would not move into the S phase include insufficient cell growth, damaged DNA, or other preparations have not been completed.

At the G1/S checkpoint, formation of the G1/S cyclin with Cdk to form a complex commits the cell to a new division cycle. These complexes then activate S-Cdk complexes that move forward with DNA replication in the S phase. Concurrently, anaphase-promoting complex (APC) activity decreases significantly, allowing S and M cyclins to become activated.

If a cell does not clear to pass through to the S phase, it enters the dormant G0 phase in which there is no cellular growth or division.

==In cancer==

Many sources have linked irregularities in the G1 phase or the G1/S checkpoint to uncontrolled growth of tumors. In these cases where the G1 phase is affected, it is generally because gene regulatory proteins of the E2F family have become unrestrained and increase G1/S cyclin gene expression, leading to uncontrolled cell-cycle entry.

However, the cure for some forms of cancer also lies in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Many cancers including breast and skin cancers have been prevented from proliferating by causing the tumor cells to enter G1 cell cycle arrest, preventing the cells from dividing and spreading.

<text>Edward O&#x27;Hara (1 October 1937 – 28 May 2016) was a British Labour politician who became Member of Parliament (MP) for Knowsley South following the death of Sean Hughes.

He held the seat from 1990 until 2010 when the constituency was abolished. During this period his seat was considered the safest Labour seat in the country. He was chairman of the committee for technology and aerospace of the Western European Union and was succeeded in 2009 by the German politician Axel Fischer.

O&#x27;Hara left the House of Commons in 2010, after being defeated in the selection process to become Labour candidate for the new seat of Knowsley by fellow MP George Howarth.

==Early life==
O&#x27;Hara was born in Bootle, near Liverpool. He was educated at the direct-grant grammar Liverpool Collegiate School, then Magdalen College, Oxford, gaining an MA in Literae Humaniores, and the University of London. Before entering Parliament, O&#x27;Hara was a councillor in Knowsley and Chair of the Education Committee. 
A lifelong Liverpool FC supporter, he taught Latin and Greek at Perse School, Cambridge, and at Birkenhead School before lecturing at C.F. Mott College of Education (later Liverpool Polytechnic) from 1970 to 1975, at the City of Liverpool College of Higher Education from 1975 to 1985, and at Liverpool Polytechnic from 1985 to 1990.

==Personal life==
He married Lilian Hopkins on 11 September 1962 in Bootle; the couple had two sons and a daughter.

<doc id="422806" wikidata="Q4910396" url="?curid=422806" title="Bill Olner">
<text>William John Olner (9 May 1942 – 18 May 2020) was a British Labour Co-operative politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Nuneaton from 1992 until 2010. Previously, he led Nuneaton Borough Council (which later merged with Bedworth to form Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough Council).

==Education and early life==

Olner was educated at Nuneaton Technical College and trained as an engineer. He became a shop steward, and later area secretary for the AEEU (now Unite trade union).

==Political career==
Olner was a councillor for the Labour group on Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough Council for 21 years and was the council leader from 1982 to 1987. In 1987 he became Mayor of Nuneaton and Bedworth, serving a 1-year term.

Olner was first elected to the House of Commons in 1992 as the Member of Parliament for Nuneaton. He was re-elected in the 1997 general election (majority 13,540), 2001 general election (majority 7,535) and 2005 general election (majority 2,280).

He most frequently asked questions about: mercury, the European Union (public information), funerals, satellite dishes, and skills councils. He most frequently asked questions to, and received answers to questions from, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, the Department of Health, and the Department for Work and Pensions.

Olner declared his retirement as MP for Nuneaton on 25 March 2007; he served until the 2010 general election, where Labour&#x27;s new candidate, Jayne Innes, was defeated by Conservative Marcus Jones.

==Return to local politics==

Olner decided three years after leaving Parliament to stand in the 2013 Warwickshire County Council Elections for the Arbury and Stockingford constituency in Nuneaton. Olner won the seat with 2092 votes, keeping him in office until May 2017.

Following County Council boundary changes, Olner decided to stand in the new Nuneaton Abbey County Division in May 2017 and won the seat until his death in 2020. The division is currently the safest Labour seat in Warwickshire.

==Personal life==
Olner lived with his wife Gill, who has been a school governor in the past.

Olner died from complications of COVID-19, amid the pandemic in England, at George Eliot Hospital in Nuneaton on 18 May 2020, at age 78.

== Early life and career ==
He was educated at Trinity Academy, Edinburgh, at the time a selective state school, and then Heriot-Watt University, where he attained a BA in economics.

He married his wife Elaine Marjorie Samuel on 21 July 1973, with them going on to raise two sons together.

O&#x27;Neill was also a patron of Humanists UK, and was one of the fifty signatories to a letter published in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2010, which called for Pope Benedict XVI not to be given a state visit to the UK, and accused the Catholic Church of increasing the spread of AIDS and promoting segregated education.

<text>Diana Mary Organ (née Pugh; born 21 February 1952) is a British Labour Party politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Forest of Dean from 1997 to 2005.

==Early life==
Her father was Finance Controller of GKN. She went to the independent Edgbaston Church of England College for Girls in Edgbaston, Birmingham (which became the co-ed St. Georges School, Birmingham in 1999). At (then all female) St Hugh&#x27;s College, Oxford, she gained a BA in Geography in 1973. At the School of Education at the University of Bath, she gained a PGCE in 1974. From Bristol Polytechnic in 1981, she gained a Diploma in Special Education.

From 1974 to 1977, she was an assistant special needs teacher. She was deputy head of St Germans primary school near Saltash, Cornwall from 1977 to 1979. From 1979 to 1982, she was Head of a Special Needs Unit in Somerset. She worked on supply in special schools in Somerset from 1982 to 1988. She was an assistant English teacher in Somerset from 1988 to 1992. She worked as a political researcher for Oxfordshire County Council from 1992 to 1995.

==Parliamentary career==
Organ contested West Gloucestershire at the 1992 general election, but was not successful. In 1995 she was again selected to stand for Labour, this time through an all-women shortlist. She was Labour Party Member of Parliament for the re-created seat of Forest of Dean from the 1997 election until she stepped down at the 2005 election, citing changing family circumstances. During her time in Parliament, she voted against the Iraq War.

During the 2009 parliamentary expenses scandal, Organ was required to repay £15,964.01 in respect of falsely claimed expenses relating to mortgage interest payments.

==Personal life==
She married Richard in 1975. The couple have two daughters.

<doc id="422813" wikidata="Q453046" url="?curid=422813" title="Burt Rutan">
<text>Elbert Leander &quot;Burt&quot; Rutan (; born June 17, 1943) is a retired American aerospace engineer and entrepreneur noted for his originality in designing light, strong, unusual-looking, and energy-efficient air and space craft. He designed the record-breaking Voyager, which in 1986 was the first plane to fly around the world without stopping or refueling. He also designed the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer, which in 2006 set the world record for the fastest (342 mph/551 km/h in 67 hours) and longest (25,766 miles/41,466 km) nonstop non-refueled circumnavigation flight in history. In 2004, Rutan&#x27;s sub-orbital spaceplane design SpaceShipOne became the first privately funded spacecraft to enter the realm of space, winning the Ansari X-Prize that year for achieving the feat twice within a two-week period.

With his VariEze and Long-EZ designs, which first flew in 1975 and 1979 respectively, Rutan is responsible for helping popularize both the canard configuration and the use of moldless composite construction in the homebuilt aircraft industry, the latter a technique that was adopted in several production and commercial aircraft in the following decades. He is the founder or co-founder of multiple aerospace companies, including the Rutan Aircraft Factory, Scaled Composites, Mojave Aerospace Ventures, and The Spaceship Company.

Rutan has designed 46 aircraft throughout his career, been included in the &quot;Time&quot; 100 Most Influential People in the World list for the year 2004, been the co-recipient of both the Collier and National Air and Space Museum trophies on two occasions (each for his accomplishments with Voyager in 1986 and SpaceShipOne in 2004), received six honorary doctoral degrees, and has won over 100 different awards for aerospace design and development. In 1995, he was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame. Rutan has five aircraft on display in the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum: the VariEze, Quickie, Voyager, SpaceShipOne, and the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer. He is the younger brother of the late test pilot and United States Air Force fighter pilot Dick Rutan, who piloted many of Burt&#x27;s earlier original designs on class record-breaking flights.

==Life and career==
Burt Rutan was born in 1943 in Estacada, Oregon, near Portland, and raised in Dinuba, California. He was one of three children born to George (a dentist) and Irene Rutan. His sister, Nell Rutan, is a former flight attendant for American Airlines. He displayed an early interest in aircraft design. By the time he was eight years old, Rutan was designing and building model aircraft. His first solo flight piloting an airplane was in an Aeronca Champ in 1959, at age 16. In 1965, he graduated third in his class from the California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo) with a BS degree in aeronautical engineering.

From 1965 to 1972, Rutan was a civilian flight test project engineer for the U.S. Air Force at Edwards Air Force Base, working on nine projects including the LTV XC-142 VSTOL transport and spin tests of the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II fighter. He left to become Director of Development of the BD-5 aircraft for Bede Aircraft in Newton, Kansas, a position he held until 1974.

In June 1974, Rutan returned to California to establish the Rutan Aircraft Factory. In this business he designed and developed prototypes for several aircraft, mostly intended for amateur builders. His first design, executed while he was still at Bede, was the VariViggen, a two-seat pusher single-engine craft of canard configuration. The canard would become a feature of many Rutan designs, notably the very popular VariEze and Long-EZ. He is also known for using exotic and unconventional materials in his designs. He was the first to use moldless composite construction. According to him, he started his composite work by copying the concept used in the repair of molded European sailplanes. His innovation was the adoption of the method not for repair but to build an aircraft with hotwire wing cores and hand-carved foam for the fuselage box. This method allowed Rutan to build a plane without a mold.

In April 1982, Rutan founded Scaled Composites, LLC, which has become one of the world&#x27;s pre-eminent aircraft design and prototyping facilities. Scaled Composites is headquartered in Mojave, California, at the Mojave Air &amp; Space Port. That same year, Beechcraft contracted Rutan&#x27;s Scaled Composites to refine the design and build the prototype Beechcraft Starship.

In 1987, Rutan received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 1988, he was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum and in 1995, the National Aviation Hall of Fame at the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio. Rutan was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 1989 for leading the engineering, design, construction, and testing of a series of aircraft, including &quot;Voyager&quot;. In 2004, after SpaceShipOne flew, he was listed as one of &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Most Influential People in the World&quot; and as &quot;Inc.&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Entrepreneur of the Year&quot;. In 2005, he received the NAS Award in Aeronautical Engineering from the National Academy of Sciences. In the same year, he was awarded the Robert J. Collier Trophy, which he also obtained in 1986 for his design and development of the Voyager 15.

In 2007, Northrop Grumman became the sole owner of Rutan&#x27;s Scaled Composites.

In a 2010 Big Think interview, Rutan articulated his motivation for developing suborbital spaceflight technology projects with SpaceShipOne and SpaceShipTwo. In it he said, &quot;we can achieve some breakthroughs&quot;, making such flight &quot;orders of magnitude safer and orders of magnitude more affordable. I&#x27;m taking this step because I think achieving something that has never existed in manned spaceflight – and that is &quot;high volume&quot; and &quot;public access&quot; – I think it is important to do that and to do it as soon as possible.&quot;

He retired from Scaled Composites in April 2011. That same year, he received the Daniel Guggenheim Medal and became recognized as a Living Legend of Aviation, receiving the Bob Hoover Freedom of Flight Award from the Kiddie Hawk Air Academy. In 2012, Rutan spoke on &quot;Innovation and the Space Race&quot; to the World Affairs Council, as recorded on C-Span. &quot;Flying&quot; magazine ranked him at number 18 on their 2013 list, &quot;51 Heroes of Aviation&quot;. Rutan was also a recipient of the prestigious Wright Brothers Memorial Trophy in 2015. In 2021, he received his second eponymous Bob Hoover award with the AOPA&#x27;s R.A. &quot;Bob&quot; Hoover Trophy, given to &quot;people in the industry who have made major contributions over the course of their careers to key areas within general aviation.&quot;

In 2022, the Mojave Air and Space Port was given the name &quot;Rutan Field&quot; in honor of the Rutan brothers&#x27; contributions to the airport, its board stating that the Rutans&#x27; aviation achievements &quot;have played a key role in the evolution of the aerospace industry and the success of the Mojave Air &amp; Space Port organization.&quot;

Burt is married to Tonya Rutan and together they have two children.

==Aircraft designs==
In a 45-year career, many of Rutan&#x27;s designs have often been quite dissimilar from their predecessors. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said of his designs: &quot;His airplanes and spacecraft take on all types of sleek shapes and sizes, looking more like the work of a sculptor than an engineer. In all, Rutan has come up with 367 individual concepts—of which 45 have flown.&quot;

===Homebuilt aircraft===
VariViggen and VariViggen SP
In 1968, he began building his first design, the VariViggen, which first flew in April 1972. It had the rear wing, forward canard, and pusher configuration design elements which became his trademarks. In lieu of wind tunnel testing, Rutan developed aerodynamic parameters for the VariViggen using a model rigged atop his station wagon, and measured the forces while driving on empty roads.

The VariViggen was the Rutan model 27. A new set of outer wings, with winglets, was later developed by Rutan for the VariViggen, producing the VariViggen SP, Rutan model 32. The VariViggen was named in honor of the Saab 37 Viggen, a canard-configured fighter jet developed in Sweden. One VariViggen, built in France and named Micro Star, was powered by two Microturbo TRS-18 jet engines in lieu of the usual piston engine.

VariEze and Long-EZ

The VariViggen design led to the successful VariEze (pronounced &quot;very easy&quot;) homebuilt aircraft designs, in which he pioneered the use of moldless glass-reinforced plastic construction in homebuilts. The prototype, designated Model 31, made its public debut at the 1975 EAA Convention and Fly-In (now called AirVenture) in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. That same year, his brother Dick Rutan set a world distance record in the under-500 kg (1100 lb) class in the VariEze, and these aircraft went on to set other world records in this class.
They were also the first aircraft to fly with NASA-developed winglets.

Rutan later revised the VariEze design, providing more volume for fuel and cargo, resulting in the Rutan model 61 Long-EZ, designed to be powered by a Lycoming O-235, although some have used Lycoming O-320s or Lycoming O-360s. The Long-EZ had a range of , over twice that of the VariEze. The Long-EZ also has a revised wing spar design that is not subject to the 2.5 g positive, 1.5 g negative, maximum load factor limit applied to the VariEze after the discovery of problems with some VariEze wings.

Quickie

Rutan was approached by Gene Sheehan and Tom Jewett to develop a single-seat personal sport aircraft. Following a preliminary canard project (model 49), a tandem wing configuration was eventually designed, to be powered by an 18 hp Onan industrial engine. The prototype (Rutan model 54) was built in 1977 and registered as N77Q. After 5 months of testing, Quickie Aircraft marketed the aircraft as the Rutan model 54 Quickie in 1978.

Two derivatives of the Quickie were subsequently developed, both expanded to include two seats. Quickie Aircraft had Gary LaGare develop the Q2, while Viking Aircraft developed the Viking Dragonfly.

Solitaire

The 1982 Sailplane Homebuilders Association (Now the Experimental Soaring Association) opened a competition for a homebuilt, self-launching sailplane. Rutan designed the model 77 Solitaire for this competition, which it won. The sailplane was canard-configured, with a retractable engine ahead of the cockpit.

===Research aircraft===

Grizzly

Rutan designed the model 72 Grizzly to investigate the possibility of a STOL canard aircraft. It was retired after testing in 1982.

Lotus Microlight

Rutan was approached by Colin Chapman, the founder of Lotus Cars, to design a single-seat ultralight aircraft. Again, a canard configuration was developed, the Rutan model 91. Colin Chapman&#x27;s death in 1982 brought this project to an end, after the aircraft had flown.

Ames AD-1

In the 1980s NASA issued a contract to Ames Industrial Company of Bohemia, New York to develop a small, low-cost aircraft to investigate Robert T. Jones&#x27;s (a NASA researcher at NASA&#x27;s Ames Research Center) oblique wing concept. Ames turned to Rutan, who designed a small, fiberglass airframe, powered by two Microturbo TRS-18 jet engines. This was the Rutan model 35, the Ames AD-1. After completion of the test program, the AD-1 was retired in 1982 and is now on exhibit in the Hiller Aviation Museum in San Carlos, California.

ARES

The Scaled Composites ARES, also called the &quot;Mudfighter&quot;, is a full-size flying and shooting prototype of a lightweight low cost aircraft with a similar ground attack and support role as the A-10. The aircraft first flew in 1990.

Boomerang

A departure from the canard design was the 1996 Boomerang, perhaps one of the unconventional designer&#x27;s most unconventional aircraft. The aircraft, the Rutan model 202 Boomerang, is an asymmetric twin-engine tractor configuration aircraft with one engine on the fuselage and another mounted on a pod. A November 1996 &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; feature article said it &quot;looks more like a trimotor that lost its right boom and engine&quot;.

BiPod

The BiPod, Rutan&#x27;s latest design in association with his company Scaled Composites, is a hybrid flying car. Announced in July 2011, the twin-pod vehicle has a wingspan of 31 feet 10 inches; with the wings reconfigured (stowed between the pods), the car has a width of 7 feet 11 inches and fits in a single-car garage. The design has two 450 cc four-cycle engines, one in each pod, which power a pair of generators that in turn power the electric motors used for propulsion. &quot;Lithium-ion batteries in the nose of each pod will provide power during take off and an emergency backup for landing. With a cruising speed of , Scaled says the Model 367 BiPod would have a range of .&quot; The plane can fly at which reduces the range to . &quot;Out on the road, this roadable aircraft, which carries of fuel, is expected to have a driving range of 820 miles. It has a claimed electric-only range of 35 miles.&quot; Flight controls are in the right pod, road controls (steering wheel and brakes) in the left.

===Performance aircraft===

Amsoil Racer

The Rutan model 68 Amsoil Racer was a racing aircraft of Quickie configuration, built in 1981. It set several speed records, but crashed at the 1983 Reno Air Races and was unsalvageable.

Voyager

The Rutan model 76 Voyager was the first airplane to fly nonstop, without refueling around the world. Piloted by Rutan&#x27;s brother Dick and Jeana Yeager the airplane made the round the world flight over 9 days in December 1986. Around-the-world flights had been accomplished by military crews using in-flight refueling.

Burt developed a twin-engined (piston engines, one pusher and one tractor) canard-configured design. The pusher engine ran continuously, the tractor engine was used for take-off and initial climb to altitude, then was shut down.

The aircraft was first flown with two Lycoming O-235 engines. After development work, it was reengined with a Continental O-200 (modified to include liquid cooling) as the pusher engine and a Continental O-240 as the tractor engine.

As a proving flight the aircraft made a record setting endurance flight off the coast of California. In December 1986, they took off from Edwards Air Force Base in California and flew around the world (westward) in nine days, fulfilling the aircraft&#x27;s design goals and setting multiple world absolute flight distance records. The Voyager was retired and now hangs in the &quot;Milestones of Flight&quot; exhibit in the National Air and Space Museum (NASM) main exhibit hall, with the &quot;Wright Flyer&quot;, &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot; and Bell X-1.

Burt and Dick Rutan, along with Yeager, made headlines for their efforts as the &quot;Voyager&quot; team and received the 1986 Collier Trophy and Presidential Citizens Medal from President Ronald Reagan.

Catbird

The Scaled Composites Model 81 Catbird is a five-seat, single-engined pressurized airplane. The airplane was configured as a three-surface aircraft (canard, main wing, and tail) and first flew in 1988. After serving as Rutan&#x27;s personal airplane, it was retired. The Catbird is notable for winning the CAFE Challenge aircraft efficiency prize in 1993.

Pond Racer

The 1991 Pond Racer was an Unlimited Class racing airplane. Concerned about the dwindling numbers of World War II aircraft, with many being consumed by use as Unlimited Class racers at the Reno Air Races, Bob Pond contracted Rutan and Scaled to design and build an Unlimited Class racer. After design studies, a twin-engined, conventional configured layout was chosen. The aircraft was powered by two Electromotive-Nissan VG-30 3-liter GTP piston engines running on methanol. The aircraft was built and tested before delivery to the customer. It appeared at the Reno Air Races in 1991, 1992 and 1993. The aircraft was destroyed in a forced landing crash on September 14, 1993, killing pilot Rick Brickert.

Proteus

The Model 281 Proteus is a tandem-wing high-endurance aircraft designed by Rutan and built by Scaled Composites to investigate the use of aircraft as high altitude telecommunications relays. The aircraft&#x27;s requirements were designed by Angel Technologies and Broadband.com. Its first flights were in 1998. It holds several altitude records, set in 2000.

GlobalFlyer

On March 3, 2005, the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer, an aircraft similar to the Voyager design but built by Scaled using stiffer materials and a single jet engine, completed the first solo non-stop, non-refueled flight around the world with adventurer Steve Fossett as pilot. Reducing weight was critical to the design, and Rutan is quoted as facetiously telling his staff that when they finish building a part, they must throw it up in the air for a weight test, and &quot;If it comes down, it&#x27;s too heavy&quot;. Between February 7, 2006 and February 11, 2006, Fossett and the GlobalFlyer set a record for the longest flight in history: , the third absolute world record set with this aircraft before being flown to the NASM Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center. The Global Flyer is the sixth aerospace vehicle designed by Rutan in the NASM collection.

SkiGull

The SkiGull is an amphibious aircraft that was publicly announced at the 2015 EAA AirVenture gathering, post Rutan&#x27;s retirement. His most recent design, the aircraft is a two-seat composite/titanium aircraft equipped with a retractable ski undercarriage that can have wheels attached for water, snow or land operations, landing on around of surface but with a range to cross oceans. It has two electric motors with forward-folding reversible propellers to simplify docking and give optional takeoff power. The SkiGull is being developed and funded privately, and had its first test flight in November 2015.

===Contracted aircraft===

Triumph

The 1988 Scaled Composites Triumph was a twin-engine, business jet prototype designed and built for Beechcraft. The aircraft is a three lifting surface design, with both a small forward wing, and a small conventional horizontal stabilizer in a T-tail configuration.

Visionair Vantage

The VisionAire VA-10 Vantage is a prototype single-engined light business-jet (or &quot;very light jet&quot;, also known as VLJ) developed by VisionAire Jets Corporation. In 1996 Rutan designed the first prototype, a proof-of-concept aircraft intended to confirm the design&#x27;s handling, which resulted in several problems and a redesign of the aircraft in 1998.

V-Jet II

The Williams V-Jet II, which first flew in 1997, was a VLJ designed and built as a test bed and demonstrator aircraft for Williams International&#x27;s new FJX-1 turbofan engine. It served as the design inspiration for the Eclipse 500, and was retired in 2001.

Adam M-309

The Adam M-309 CarbonAero was a technology demonstrator six-seat civil utility aircraft designed by Rutan and built by Scaled Composites in the early 2000s. It developed into the A500, which is produced by Adam Aircraft Industries.

Stratolaunch

In 2011, Rutan and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen announced the Stratolaunch, a space launch carrier aircraft built by Scaled Composites for Allen&#x27;s Stratolaunch Systems to carry air launch to orbit rockets.

==Spacecraft designs==

SpaceShipOne
Rutan made headlines again in June 2004 with SpaceShipOne, which became the first privately built, flown and funded crewed craft to reach space. The project, named &quot;Tier One&quot; (later known as Tier 1b), was developed and flown by Mojave Aerospace Ventures, which is part-owned by Scaled Composites and was a joint venture between Paul Allen and Rutan, with an estimated development cost of US$25 million (provided entirely by Allen). On October 4, the SpaceShipOne team won the Ansari X Prize of US$10 million, completing two flights within two weeks, flying with the equivalent weight of 3 persons, and doing so while reusing at least 80% of the vehicle hardware. The two flights were piloted by Mike Melville and Brian Binnie respectively. The project team was honored with the 2004 Collier Trophy, awarded by the National Aeronautic Association for &quot;greatest achievement in aeronautics or astronautics in America&quot;. The craft embodies Rutan&#x27;s unique style, and is another of the &quot;icons of flight&quot; displayed in the NASM &quot;Milestones of Flight&quot; exhibit. As the first privately-funded spacecraft, it helped spur the beginning of the global private space race.

SpaceShipTwo Project
Virgin Galactic—an offshoot of businessman and investor Sir Richard Branson&#x27;s Virgin Group, and the parent company of Branson and Rutan&#x27;s 2005 spacecraft manufacturing startup The Spaceship Company—announced that it would begin space tourism flights in 2008 using craft based on the designs of SpaceShipOne. Dubbed SpaceShipTwo, these new craft, also designed by Rutan, are intended to allow six &quot;experience optimized&quot; passengers to glimpse the planet from 70 to 80 miles up in suborbital space. Production of the first of five planned SpaceShipTwo craft has started, but commercial flights did not begin in 2008 as planned. An explosion at the Scaled Composite factory at the Mojave Spaceport on July 26, 2007, which killed three engineers and seriously injured three others, may have contributed to the delay. They were testing components for SpaceShipTwo, but Scaled Composites remained dedicated to perfecting the design of SpaceShipTwo. Virgin continues to work on developing SpaceShipTwo, but it has stopped predicting when commercial spaceflights will begin. A further SpaceshipTwo accident on October 31, 2014 (VSS Enterprise tail number: N339SS) resulted in the death of copilot Michael Alsbury and injuries to the pilot.

Rutan was also working with t/Space in the mid-2000s on the development of an air launched, two-stage-to-orbit, crewed spacecraft. It was intended to have a taxi capacity to carry passengers to the International Space Station. In June 2005, air drop tests of quarter scale mockups verified the practicality of air release and rotation to vertical.
White Knight One and Two

On July 28, 2008, Richard Branson unveiled Scaled Composites White Knight Two &quot;Eve&quot;, at the Mojave Spaceport. The jet-powered cargo aircraft is based on SpaceShipOne&#x27;s successful mothership, White Knight One, which was designed by Rutan and based on Proteus. Flight tests were set to begin in September 2008. The launch customer of White Knight Two is Virgin Galactic, which will have the first 2 units, and exclusive rights to the craft for the first few years. In 2008, Branson predicted that the maiden space voyage would take place within 18 months: &quot;It represents ... the chance for our ever-growing group of future astronauts and other scientists to see our world in a completely new light.&quot; Virgin Galactic contracted Rutan to build the mothership and spacecraft.

==Retirement and post-retirement work==
On November 3, 2010, Scaled Composites announced the retirement of Rutan:

&quot;Burt Rutan, founder of aerospace research firm Scaled Composites in 1982, had announced his plans to retire in April 2011. He currently serves as Scaled&#x27;s chief technical officer and, following his retirement, Burt will assume the title of founder and chairman emeritus. Burt has worked in California&#x27;s Antelope Valley for more than 45 years, initially as flight test project engineer for the Air Force and in 1974 he founded the Rutan Aircraft Factory to develop experimental aircraft for homebuilders.&quot;

&quot;Burt is known worldwide as a legendary genius in aircraft design in the aviation world. I am very fortunate and proud to have worked by his side for the past 28 years&quot;, says President Douglas B. Shane. &quot;We wish Burt and his wife, Tonya, the very best the future holds for them.&quot;

On April 1, 2011, Rutan retired from Scaled Composites to his home in Coeur d&#x27;Alene, Idaho.

Rutan has continued working out of his home in retirement on various designs since stepping down from Scaled Composites in 2011. That year he said that he was working on one more innovative design.
In July 2011, this was revealed to be a hybrid flying car, the Model 367 BiPod.

In 2015 he began water and flight testing a prototype of a new amphibious aircraft, the Rutan SkiGull, intended to be capable of flying between Hawaii and California, cruising at , taking off or landing in about on challenging surfaces including rough terrain, seas, grass, snow, or ordinary runways, fueled by ordinary automotive or marine gasoline, and having small electric motors for power assists or emergency landing.

Rutan also advised on the design of the Paul Allen-funded Stratolaunch space launch carrier since retiring in 2011, which is the world&#x27;s largest airplane by wingspan, and in 2019 announced that he was working on a new eVTOL.

<doc id="422814" wikidata="Q332493" url="?curid=422814" title="George Osborne">
<text>George Gideon Oliver Osborne (born 23 May 1971) is a British retired politician and newspaper editor who served as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 2010 to 2016 and as First Secretary of State from 2015 to 2016 in the Cameron government. A member of the Conservative Party, he was Member of Parliament (MP) for Tatton from 2001 to 2017.

The son of the Osborne &amp; Little co-founder and baronet Peter Osborne, Osborne was born in Paddington and educated at Norland Place School, Colet Court and St Paul&#x27;s School, London before studying at the University of Oxford as an undergraduate student of Magdalen College, Oxford. After working briefly as a freelancer for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, he joined the Conservative Research Department in 1994 and became head of its political section. He went on to be a special adviser to Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Douglas Hogg and work for John Major at 10 Downing Street, including on Major&#x27;s unsuccessful 1997 general election campaign. In Opposition, he worked as a speechwriter and political secretary to Major&#x27;s successor as party leader, William Hague. Osborne was elected as MP for Tatton in 2001, becoming the youngest Conservative member of the House of Commons. He was appointed Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury by Conservative leader Michael Howard in 2004. The following year he ran David Cameron&#x27;s successful party leadership campaign, and was subsequently appointed Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer.

After the 2010 general election, Osborne was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Cameron–Clegg coalition. He succeeded Alistair Darling, inheriting a large deficit in government finances due to the effects of the 2007–2008 financial crisis. As Chancellor, Osborne&#x27;s tenure pursued considerably severe austerity policies, aimed at reducing the budget deficit and launched the Northern Powerhouse initiative. In 2012, Osborne significantly reduced taxes for the top rate of earners. After the Conservatives won an overall majority in the 2015 general election, Cameron reappointed him Chancellor in his second government and gave him the additional title of First Secretary of State. He was widely viewed as a potential successor to David Cameron as Leader of the Conservative Party; one Conservative MP, Nadhim Zahawi, suggested that the closeness of his relationship with Cameron meant that the two effectively shared power during the duration of the Cameron governments. Following the 2016 referendum vote to leave the European Union and Cameron&#x27;s consequent resignation, he was dismissed by Cameron&#x27;s successor, Theresa May.

Osborne served on the backbenches for a year before leaving public office at the 2017 general election. He was editor of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; from 2017 to 2020. He has been chair of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership (NPP) since 2016 and of the British Museum since 2021. Osborne&#x27;s chancellorship has been subject to critical assessment. His austerity measures are generally now viewed as having failed to reduce unemployment, lower interest rates, or stimulate growth, and have been linked to worsened inequality and poverty and a rise in political instability.

== Early life and education ==
Osborne was born in Paddington, London, as Gideon Oliver Osborne. His father is Sir Peter Osborne, 17th Baronet, co-founder of the firm of fabric and wallpaper designers Osborne &amp; Little. His mother is Felicity Alexandra Loxton-Peacock, the daughter of Hungarian-born Jewish artist Clarisse Loxton-Peacock (&quot;née&quot; Fehér). He is the eldest of four boys. He decided when he was 13 to be known by the additional first name of &#x27;George&#x27;. In an interview in July 2005, he said: &quot;It was my small act of rebellion. I never liked it [the name &#x27;Gideon&#x27;]. When I finally told my mother she said, &#x27;Nor do I&#x27;. So I decided to be George after my grandfather [Sir George Francis Osborne, 16th Baronet], who was a war hero. Life was easier as a George; it was a straightforward name.&quot; Osborne is to inherit his father&#x27;s baronetcy; he would thus become Sir George Osborne, 18th Baronet.

Osborne was educated at private schools: Norland Place School, Colet Court and St Paul&#x27;s School. In 1990 he started his undergraduate study at the University of Oxford where he was awarded a demyship at Magdalen College, Oxford, and in 1993, he received an upper second class (2:1) bachelor&#x27;s degree in Modern History. Whilst there, he was a member of the Bullingdon Club. He also attended Davidson College in North Carolina for a semester, as a Dean Rusk Scholar.

In 1993, Osborne intended to pursue a career in journalism. He was shortlisted for, but failed to gain a place on, &quot;The Times&quot;″ trainee scheme; he also applied to &quot;The Economist&quot;, where he was interviewed and rejected by Gideon Rachman. In the end, he had to settle for freelance work on the &#x27;Peterborough&#x27; diary column in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. One of his Oxford friends, journalist George Bridges, alerted Osborne some time later to a research vacancy at Conservative Central Office.

Osborne joined the Conservative Research Department in 1994, and became head of its Political Section. One of his first roles was to go to Blackpool and observe the October 1994 Labour Party Conference.

Between 1995 and 1997 he worked as a special adviser to Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Douglas Hogg (during the BSE crisis), and in the Political Office at 10 Downing Street. Osborne worked on Prime Minister John Major&#x27;s campaign team in 1997, in the run-up to the Tories&#x27; heavy election defeat that year. After the election, he again considered journalism, approaching &quot;The Times&quot; to be a leader writer, though nothing came of it.

Between 1997 and 2001 he worked for William Hague, Major&#x27;s successor as Conservative Party leader, as a speechwriter and political secretary. He helped to prepare Hague for the weekly session of Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions, often playing the role of Prime Minister Tony Blair. Under the subsequent leaderships of Michael Howard and David Cameron, he remained on the Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions team.

== Member of Parliament ==
Osborne was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Tatton, Cheshire, at the June 2001 election. He succeeded Independent MP Martin Bell, who had defeated the controversial former Conservative minister Neil Hamilton in 1997 but had kept his promise not to stand there at the following election. Osborne won with a majority of 8,611 over the Labour candidate, becoming (at that time) the youngest Conservative MP in the House of Commons. At the 2005 election he was re-elected with an increased majority of 11,731 (securing 51.8% of the vote), and in 2010 increased his majority still further to 14,487.

== Shadow Chancellor (2005–2010) ==
He was appointed in September 2004 by then Conservative leader Michael Howard to the Shadow Cabinet, as Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury.

Following the 2005 general election, Howard promoted him to Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer at the young age of 33. Howard had initially offered the post to William Hague, who turned it down. Press reports suggest that the second choice for the post was David Cameron, who also rejected the job, preferring to take on a major public service portfolio (he was made Shadow Secretary of State for Education). Thus, Howard seems to have turned to Osborne as his third choice for the role. His promotion prompted speculation he would run for the leadership of the Conservative Party when Howard stepped down, but he ruled himself out within a week. Osborne served as campaign manager for David Cameron&#x27;s leadership campaign, and kept the Shadow Chancellor&#x27;s post when Cameron became leader later that year.

When David Cameron was asked in 2009 whether or not he would be willing to sack a close colleague such as Osborne, he stated, &quot;With George, the answer is yes. He stayed in my shadow cabinet not because he is a friend, not because we are godfathers to each other&#x27;s children but because he is the right person to do the job. I know and he knows that if that was not the case he would not be there.&quot;

At this time Osborne expressed an interest in the ideas of &quot;tax simplification&quot; (including the idea of flat tax). He set up a &quot;Tax Reform Commission&quot; in October 2005 to investigate ideas for how to create a &quot;flatter, simpler&quot; tax system. The system then proposed would reduce the income tax rate to a flat 22%, and increase the personal allowance from £4,435 to between £10,000 and £15,500. However, the idea of a flat tax was not included in the 2010 Conservative Party manifesto.

=== Comments on Gordon Brown ===
During Osborne&#x27;s response to the Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown&#x27;s &quot;Pre-Budget Report&quot; on 5 December 2005, he accused Brown of being &quot;a Chancellor past his sell-by-date, a Chancellor holding Britain back&quot;. In an interview the same week, he also referred to Brown as &quot;brutal&quot; and &quot;unpleasant&quot;. Osborne was rebuked in October 2006 by Michael Martin, the Speaker of the House of Commons, when he attacked the Chancellor at Oral Questions by citing a comment attributed to the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions John Hutton, describing the Chancellor as likely to make an &quot;effing awful&quot; Prime Minister. It was widely suggested that Osborne was leading an assault on Brown that would allow the Conservatives to discredit him without damaging David Cameron&#x27;s public image. That month, Osborne faced criticism from some quarters for appearing to suggest that Brown was &quot;faintly autistic&quot;. After Osborne spoke in an interview about his own ability to recall odd facts, a host suggested to him that he may have been &quot;faintly autistic&quot;; he responded by saying that &quot;We&#x27;re not getting onto Gordon Brown yet&quot;.

=== Pledge to match Labour spending ===
In September 2007, ahead of the publication of the 2007 Comprehensive Spending Review, Osborne pledged that the Conservative Party would match Labour&#x27;s public spending plans for the next three years. He promised increases in public spending of 2% a year, and said Labour charges that the Conservatives would cut public spending were &quot;a pack of lies&quot;. He also ruled out any &quot;upfront, unfunded tax cuts&quot;.

=== Deripaska claim ===
Osborne&#x27;s school and university contemporary, financier Nathaniel Rothschild, said in October 2008 that Osborne had tried to solicit a £50,000 donation from the Russian aluminium magnate Oleg Deripaska, which would have been a violation of the law against political donations by foreign citizens. Rothschild had hosted Deripaska, Osborne, Peter Mandelson and others at a party in his villa in Corfu. The alleged solicitation of a donation occurred on Deripaska&#x27;s yacht during the party.

The Electoral Commission received a formal complaint initiated in a letter by the Liberal Democrats&#x27; Home Affairs spokesperson, Chris Huhne, urging them to investigate the allegations against Osborne. The Commission rejected the claims and said it saw &quot;no information&quot; suggesting an offence. The accusation was referred to by the press as &#x27;Yachtgate&#x27;. Osborne denied claims he had attempted to solicit a donation from Deripaska and said that he had &quot;made a mistake&quot; by meeting with him.

=== &quot;Run on the pound&quot; ===
On 14 November 2008, in an intervention described by the BBC&#x27;s Nick Robinson as &quot;pretty extraordinary&quot;, Osborne publicly warned that the more the government borrows, the less attractive sterling becomes to hold. He said: &quot;We are in danger, if the government is not careful, of having a proper sterling collapse, a run on the pound.&quot; Labelling Gordon Brown&#x27;s tactic a &quot;scorched-earth policy&quot; that a future Conservative government would have to clear up, Osborne continued: &quot;His view is he probably won&#x27;t win the next election. The Tories can clear this mess up after I&#x27;ve gone.&quot;

=== Expenses ===
In 2009 and 2012 Osborne was criticised for his expense claims, in particular for the claims for mortgage interest payments on his Cheshire properties. Osborne had funded the purchase of a country farmhouse and adjoining paddock in Cheshire before he became an MP in 2001 by way of a £455,000 extension of the mortgage on his London home. In 2003 he substituted a new £450,000 mortgage on the Cheshire property, which he then designated as his second home, or &quot;flipped&quot;. As a result, he was able to claim up to £100,000 in mortgage interest on the house and paddock between 2003 and 2010, when the regulations changed. In 2012 it was revealed that the paddock had been legally separate from the farmhouse.

The Liberal Democrats said he had a &quot;moral obligation&quot; to pay an estimated £55,000 in capital gains tax to the public purse which he had saved through the designation or &quot;flipping&quot; of his London property as his main home. He had previously paid back £1,193 spent on chauffeur fares and overpayments on his mortgage after a complaint from a Labour activist, and it also emerged that he had claimed £47 for two copies of a DVD of his own speech on &quot;value for taxpayers&#x27; money&quot;. The report of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards found that although Osborne had breached the rules, the offence was &quot;unintended and relatively minor&quot;. Osborne said he had received &quot;flawed&quot; advice and not benefited personally.

=== 2010 general election campaign ===
During the 2010 general election campaign Osborne was considered to have been sidelined, owing to his perceived unpopularity and the perception by both Liberal Democrat and Labour strategists that he was a &quot;weak link&quot;.

== Chancellor of the Exchequer (2010–2016) ==

Osborne was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer on 11 May 2010, and was sworn in as a Privy Counsellor two days later. On 4 October 2010, in a speech at the Conservative conference in Birmingham, Osborne announced a cap on the overall amount of benefits a family can receive from the state, estimated to be around £500 a week from 2013. He also announced that he would end the universal entitlement to child benefit, and that from 2013 the entitlement would be removed from people paying the 40% and 50% income tax rates.

In February 2011 Osborne announced Project Merlin, whereby banks aimed to lend about £190 billion to businesses in 2011, curb bonuses and reveal some salary details of their top earners; meanwhile, the bank levy would increase by £800 million. Osborne&#x27;s 2011 Autumn Statement was delivered to Parliament on 29 November 2011. It included a programme of supply-side economic reforms such as investments in infrastructure intended to support economic growth.

In 2012, Osborne cut the 50% income tax rate on top earners and figures from Her Majesty&#x27;s Revenue and Customs showed that the amount of additional-rate tax paid had increased under the new rate from £38 billion in 2012/13 to £46 billion in 2013/14, which Osborne said was caused by the new rate being more &quot;competitive&quot;, however HMRC predictions in March 2012 predicted that around £6.25 billion in tax revenue would be delayed from 2012/13 to 2013/14 due to the expected lower tax rate, possibly explaining much of the increased revenue, and that the change would cost around £2.4 billion in 2012, however this cost would decrease and was expected to be nullified by 2016/17. In October 2012, Osborne proposed a new policy to boost the hiring of staff, under which companies would be able to give new appointees shares worth between £2,000 and £50,000, but the appointees would lose the right to claim unfair dismissal and time off for training.

In February 2013, the UK lost its AAA credit rating—which Osborne had indicated to be a priority when coming to power—for the first time since 1978. His March 2013 budget was made when the Office for Budget Responsibility had halved its forecast for that year&#x27;s economic growth from 1.2% to 0.6%.

Osborne announced on 16 May that he would deliver a second Budget on 8 July, and promised action on tax avoidance by the rich by bringing in a &quot;Google tax&quot; designed to discourage large companies diverting profits out of the UK to avoid tax. The second Budget also increased funding for the National Health Service, more apprenticeships, efforts to increase productivity and cuts to the welfare budget. The July budget postponed the predicted arrival of a UK surplus from 2019 to 2020, and included an extra £18 billion more borrowing for 2016–20 than planned for the same period in March.

In Osborne&#x27;s 2016 budget he introduced a sugar tax and raised the tax-free allowance for income tax to £11,500, as well as lifting the 40% income tax threshold to £45,000. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Osborne was &quot;the driving force&quot; behind the BBC licence fee agreement which saw the BBC responsible for funding the £700 million welfare cost of free TV licences for the over-75s, meaning that it lost almost 20% of its income. &quot;The Guardian&quot; also noted Osborne&#x27;s four meetings with News Corp representatives and two meetings with Rupert Murdoch before the deal was announced. Following the UK&#x27;s vote to leave the European Union in June 2016, Osborne pledged to further lower corporation tax to &quot;encourage businesses to continue investing in the UK&quot;. Osborne had already cut the corporation tax rate from 28% to 20%, with plans to lower it to 17% by 2020.

=== Reception ===
Osborne&#x27;s chancellorship has been subject to much critical assessment. His austerity measures are generally now viewed as having failed to reduce unemployment, lower interest rates, or stimulate growth. Extensive cuts in his 2010 budget to benefits, meant to force beneficiaries into work, have been linked to a steep rise in inequality. While the Gini coefficient for disposable income in 2011–12 fell to 32.3 per cent, the lowest level since 1986, it quickly rose again. Reviewing his performance in July 2016, &quot;The Guardian&quot; said that the UK still had a budget deficit of 4%, a balance-of-payments (trade) deficit of 7% of GDP, and (apart from Italy) the worst productivity among the G7 nations. An Office for National Statistics graph including the period 2010–2016 shows a worsening balance-of-trade deficit. One study by the Progressive Economy Forum assessed that the United Kingdom lost £540 billion in public spending since George Osborne initiated austerity measures. The study claimed Osborne could have &quot;maintained historic rates of growth in public spending and still have reduced Britain&#x27;s government debt burden by 2019&quot;. Another by the New Economics Foundation claimed austerity had shrunk the British economy by £100 billion by 2019, due to its slower growth in every year since 2010. The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) issued a report in 2019 claiming that austerity was linked to 130,000 preventable deaths since 2012. That was the year of the 2012 United Kingdom budget– dubbed the &quot;omnishambles budget&quot; by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband – viewed as the nadir of Osborne&#x27;s political fortunes. Osborne reduced taxation for the wealthy, cutting the 50% income tax rate on top earners – which he said had been specially designated by his predecessor as &quot;temporary&quot; – to 45%.

Overall, Osborne&#x27;s policies have been linked to worsened inequality and poverty, a rise in political instability, and, allegedly, the decline of the NHS. After polling in 2012 revealed Osborne to be the least popular member of parliament, he was loudly booed by the crowd while presenting medals at the London Paralympics. In 2023, the magazine &quot;Prospect&quot; also described Osborne as the &quot;architect of austerity&quot; and described him as the worst chancellor in postwar British history, second perhaps only to Kwasi Kwarteng (who served 38 days).

== Political views ==

The &quot;Financial Times&quot; describes Osborne as &quot;metropolitan and socially liberal. He is hawkish on foreign policy with links to Washington neo-conservatives and ideologically committed to cutting the state. A pragmatic Eurosceptic&quot;. There is evidence of this commitment to cutting the state in his party&#x27;s manifesto, with Osborne and the Conservatives seeking to cut the deficit &quot;faster and deeper&quot; than any other main party as well as committing to various tax cuts such as inheritance tax and national insurance. According to an IFS report before the 2010 general election, the Conservatives needed to find more money from cuts beyond what they had outlined than any other major party, although the report was also critical of Labour and the Liberal Democrats. He has stated that the British economy must diversify away from London following the 2008 banking crisis, most notably in the form of the Northern Powerhouse policy proposals which aim to improve transport links and boost science and technology investment in the cities of the North in order to increase economic output.

After previously drawing parallels between Ed Miliband&#x27;s economic views and those of Karl Marx in &quot;Das Kapital&quot;, in a 2017 interview with former Treasury colleague Lord O&#x27;Neill, Osborne said Marx&#x27;s thesis in &quot;Das Kapital&quot; that capitalists would take an increasing share of wealth from the proceeds of economic production at the expense of workers could be argued as an accurate description of something that appeared to be occurring under the process of globalization, arguing that there was a need to &quot;democratise capital&quot; and ensure &quot;that people have more capital in capitalism&quot;, such as larger pensions and more opportunities for savings and home and share ownership.

===Brexit===
At the time of the 2016 referendum Osborne was prominently in favour of the UK remaining in the EU.

== Political relationships ==
Whilst David Cameron was prime minister, Osborne was widely viewed as a potential future leader of the Conservatives were Cameron to stand down and trigger a leadership contest, despite being seen as a relatively unpopular figure with the general public. Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi suggested that the closeness of his relationship with Cameron meant the two effectively shared power in the 2010–16 government, whilst commentators pointed to Osborne&#x27;s hand in Cabinet reshuffles. He worked hard on rebuilding his image after the much-criticised 2012 budget.

Michael Deacon of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; has described Osborne as &quot;the prince of the parliamentary putdown&quot; after, during one House of Commons debate, he managed to taunt both Ed Balls and Norman Baker in one sentence. Osborne denied rumours that he had referred to his colleague Iain Duncan Smith as &quot;not clever enough&quot;, which were published in Matthew d&#x27;Ancona&#x27;s book &quot;In It Together&quot;.

On 28 June 2016, Osborne ruled out standing as a candidate in that year&#x27;s party leadership election, stating he was &quot;not the person to provide the unity&quot; his party needed.

== Backbencher (2016–2017) ==
Osborne was sacked by Theresa May on 13 July 2016, following her appointment as Prime Minister. He returned to the backbenches and Philip Hammond replaced him as Chancellor. It was announced on 4 August 2016 that Osborne was to be made a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in the Resignation Honours list following David Cameron&#x27;s resignation. Unlike Cameron, Osborne intended to remain an MP and stand for Parliament again in 2020, although proposed boundary changes could have led to the abolition of his Tatton constituency.

In September 2016, he launched the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, a body bringing together business leaders and politicians to promote regional devolution.

By October 2016, he was writing a book called &quot;Age of Unreason&quot;; it is a diatribe against &quot;populist nationalism&quot;. Osborne&#x27;s lucrative speaking engagements for a range of financial institutions since his dismissal as Chancellor helped make him the highest earning MP in 2016. In February 2017 he started a new role as a part-time advisor to BlackRock, the world&#x27;s largest fund manager, for a salary of £650,000 for a one-day a week. The job was approved by the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments, which stated that during Osborne&#x27;s time as Chancellor &quot;there were no specific policy decisions ... that would have affected BlackRock&quot;, and the Permanent Secretary at the Treasury had &quot;no concerns&quot; about Osborne taking up the role.

In 2017, Osborne became the first Kissinger Fellow at the McCain Institute for International Leadership. While the institute is based in John McCain&#x27;s home state of Arizona, Osborne remained in the UK.

Osborne announced he would be standing down as MP for Tatton in April 2017, a day after the 2017 general election was declared. He did not rule out returning to the Commons at some point. &quot;It&#x27;s still too early to be writing my memoirs&quot;, he wrote in a letter to his constituency party, adding he did not &quot;want to spend the rest of my life just being an ex-chancellor. I want new challenges&quot;.

== Career after Parliament ==
=== &quot;Evening Standard&quot; editor ===
Then still an MP, Osborne was announced on 17 March 2017 as the next editor of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, a position which he assumed on 2 May. Critics of his appointment questioned his lack of journalistic experience and his intention to remain MP for Tatton during his tenure with the newspaper, which other MPs said would constitute a conflict of interest and devalued the role of an MP. He was also accused of breaking the post-ministerial employment rules of the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments by accepting the editorship without the committee&#x27;s approval.

&quot;Private Eye&quot; subsequently documented in detail the relationship between Osborne and &quot;Standard&quot; owner Evgeny Lebedev, who appointed Osborne as editor. During Osborne&#x27;s time as Chancellor of the Exchequer he regularly pledged Treasury money to &quot;Standard&quot; charitable campaigns, such as his offer in 2015 to match readers&#x27; donations by up to £1.5 million to the &quot;Standard&quot;″s Great Ormond Street Hospital appeal. In September 2015, the newspaper ranked Osborne in joint-first place on its annual &#x27;Progress 1000&#x27; list of the most influential people in London. It was also highlighted that, as Chancellor, Osborne failed to tackle the advantageous tax status for so-called non-doms, which Lebedev was understood to benefit from, while Lebedev&#x27;s paper strongly supported the Conservative Party in the 2015 general election and the Conservatives&#x27; candidate Zac Goldsmith in the 2016 London mayoral election.

After stepping down from politics, Osborne took on several engagements in addition to his work as editor. Among them was being named a distinguished visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution and a dean&#x27;s fellow at the Stanford Graduate School of Business in September 2017. He specialised in research on international politics and the global economy. He continued to advise the asset manager BlackRock and also began advising his brother&#x27;s firm 9Yards Capital. He joined 9Yards, a growth stage venture capital firm focused on financial technology and IT logistics investments, in 2018 as a partner and chairman.

In mid-2018, the &quot;Standard&quot; reported a loss of £10 million for the last year to the end of September. That year the paper dropped &#x27;London&#x27; from its title to reflect greater national and international ambitions as part of a relaunch. For 2018, the &quot;Standard&quot; reported a £11.5 million loss amid speculation of &quot;ad struggles&quot;.

In February 2020, questions were raised about Osborne&#x27;s future at the &quot;Standard&quot;. On 12 June it was announced that he would step down as editor to move to the role of editor-in-chief. He was succeeded as editor by the former deputy editor of British &quot;Vogue&quot; and sister-in-law of David Cameron, Emily Sheffield, on 1 July 2020.

=== Comment on Theresa May ===
In a profile of Osborne published by &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine in September 2017, it was said that he had commented to several staff at the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; that he would not be satisfied until Theresa May was &quot;chopped up in bags in my freezer&quot;. While Osborne had used macabre imagery about May in the past, he did not directly comment on the incident, although he was criticised for the alleged remark. An editorial in the &quot;Standard&quot;, published nearly a week later, was interpreted as Osborne&#x27;s apology to May. It said &quot;harsh words&quot; had been said in connection with the Prime Minister&#x27;s Brexit policy, but &quot;intemperate language, even when said in jest&quot; was inappropriate.

=== Attempts to return to politics ===
In 2018 Osborne was discussed as a potential candidate for Mayor of London in the election scheduled to be held in 2020. He said that as well as considering a bid, he would not rule out a return to Parliament. However, in an interview he said he would not stand for mayor as it would clash with his role as editor of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;.

In July 2019, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported that Osborne was seeking backing to replace Christine Lagarde as managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Osborne needed to be nominated by directors on the IMF&#x27;s executive board, who were elected by member countries, to enter the contest. Both European and British government sources said that Osborne, who backed Boris Johnson in the Conservative Party leadership election, would likely be the British nomination, due in part to Johnson&#x27;s accession to Prime Minister. Lagarde&#x27;s replacement was to be selected by the executive board, where the United States, Japan and China held the largest shares of the total vote. Several UK government figures, including Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid, endorsed Osborne for the role. Boris Johnson spoke to US President Donald Trump in a phone call to rally support for Osborne. On 6 September 2019, Osborne abandoned his IMF leadership attempt, and sources later confirmed that the chief executive of the World Bank, Kristalina Georgieva, had been put forward as the European Union&#x27;s nominee.

=== Career diversification ===
In August 2020, Osborne&#x27;s name was suggested as a possible candidate for chairman of the BBC as, according to the &quot;i&quot; newspaper, he had maintained &quot;good relations&quot; with Boris Johnson. In October &quot;The Telegraph&quot; reported that ministers had raised the salary cap to £160,000 a year for the role, and that they might have raised it further to £280,000 in order to tempt Osborne. Richard Sharp was later appointed.

Osborne left his roles at the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; and BlackRock in March 2021, and in April became an investment banker at Robey Warshaw.

In June 2021 it was announced that the trustees of the British Museum had unanimously elected Osborne as the museum&#x27;s chairman. He joined the museum&#x27;s board of trustees on 1 September 2021 and formally became chairman on 4 October.

On 25 September 2022, Osborne and Ed Balls became regular commentators on &quot;The Andrew Neil Show&quot; on Channel 4. Subsequently, on 14 September 2023, Osborne and Balls started hosting the economics-focused politics podcast &quot;Political Currency&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
Osborne was portrayed by Sebastian Armesto in the 2015 Channel 4 television film &quot;Coalition&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Osborne is heir apparent to his family&#x27;s Irish baronetcy, of Ballentaylor and Ballylemon in County Waterford. In 2009, he had an estimated personal fortune of around £4 million, as the beneficiary of a trust fund that owns a 15% stake in Osborne &amp; Little, the wallpaper-and-fabrics company co-founded by his father, Sir Peter Osborne.

Osborne married Frances Howell, author and elder daughter of Lord Howell of Guildford, a Conservative politician, on 4 April 1998. They have two children—Luke Benedict (born 15 June 2001) and Liberty Kate (born 27 June 2003)—who were both born in Westminster.

In July 2019, the couple announced that they were to divorce.

In May 2018, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that Osborne and his siblings had discovered &quot;with delight&quot; that their maternal grandmother Clarisse Loxton-Peacock (a Hungarian émigrée) was Jewish, and therefore that in Jewish law they are Jewish too.

In April 2021, Osborne announced his engagement to Thea Rogers after two years of dating. Rogers had been his special adviser and later Chief of Staff when he was Chancellor. The couple&#x27;s first child, a son named Beau, was born on 15 July 2021. Rogers gave birth to their second child, a son named Arthur, on 30 December 2022. Before their wedding in July 2023, a poison pen email was circulated. The couple were married on 8 July 2023. A protester, initially believed to be from the environmental group Just Stop Oil, threw orange confetti over them as they left the church following the wedding ceremony. Just Stop Oil denied responsibility for the incident.

== Honours ==
* 13 May 2010: appointed to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom, giving the honorific style of &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; for life.
* 4 August 2016: appointed Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in David Cameron&#x27;s Resignation Honours. This appointment granted him the Post Nominal Letters &quot;CH&quot; for Life.

<doc id="422817" wikidata="Q576175" url="?curid=422817" title="Sandra Osborne">
<text>Sandra Currie Osborne (née Clark, born 23 February 1956) is a Scottish Labour politician, who was the Member of Parliament for Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock from the 2005 to 2015 general elections. She was first elected as MP for the Ayr constituency in 1997, and resigned from a government job in 2003 over the Iraq War. She was a member of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee from 2005 to 2010 and again from 2013. She was a member of the Defence Select Committee 2010-13 and was a member of the Council of Europe.

==Before Parliament==
Osborne was born and brought up in the deprived Ferguslie Park district, in Paisley. She was educated at Camphill Secondary School in Paisley. She later attended evening classes before going on to Jordanhill College where she gained the Diploma in Community Education. After working as a community worker in Glasgow she moved to Ayrshire, where she spent fourteen years working as a counsellor with Women&#x27;s Aid, based in Kilmarnock. During that time, she also studied part-time at the University of Strathclyde where she graduated with a Master of Science in Equality and Discrimination. In 1997, she was one of the shortlisted finalists in the Scottish Woman of the Year Awards (&quot;Glasgow Evening Times&quot;) nominated for her work with abused women.

==Political career==
Osborne was the councillor for Whitletts on Kyle and Carrick District Council and South Ayrshire Council where she also served as Convener of Community Services (Housing and Social Work). She is a member of the trade union Unite (formerly TGWU) and has been active in the Labour Party since 1976, serving for a time as Ayr CLP Secretary. In 1983, she was a member of the Scottish contingent on the People&#x27;s March for Jobs who walked from Glasgow to London. She was selected as a Labour candidate in Ayr from an all-women shortlist. In May 1997, she was elected as MP for the Ayr constituency, becoming Ayr&#x27;s first-ever Labour MP and first ever female MP. She was re-elected at the 2001 general election.

Osborne served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Helen Liddell, the Secretary of State for Scotland, from June 2002 until she stepped down in March 2003 over her opposition to going to war with Iraq. She believed this should not have gone ahead without a second UN resolution. She had previously served as PPS to George Foulkes, Minister of State at the Scotland Office and to his predecessor in that post, Brian Wilson. She has served as Chair of the Scottish Group of Labour MPs and member of the Scottish Executive of the Labour Party. She has served as Chair of the All Party Group on Meningitis. She was a member of the Kerley Committee on the Renewal of Local Democracy, providing a minority report opposing proportional representation.

In June 2004, Osborne was selected as the Labour candidate for the new constituency of Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock, where she was returned at the 2005 general election with a majority of 9,997 votes. She served on the Foreign Affairs Select Committee from 2005 to 2010. She was also Secretary of the All Party Group on Colombia and the Women, Peace and Security Group. In 2006, then-Prime Minister Tony Blair appointed her as a member of the UK Delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). 

On 6 May 2010, Osborne was re-elected as MP for Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock with a majority of 9,911 votes. In 2010, she was elected Vice Chair of Labour&#x27;s backbench Foreign Affairs Committee and Chair of the All Party Equalities Group. In October 2010, she was appointed to the Defence Select Committee and the Council of Europe. In 2011, she was a member of the special Select Committee set up to scrutinise the Bill that became the Armed Forces Act 2011. In January 2011, the Speaker of the House of Commons appointed her to his Panel of Chairs. She was reappointed to the Foreign Affairs Select Committee in 2013.

==Family==
Her husband is Alastair Osborne, who was the Labour candidate in the same Ayr constituency in 1992 that Sandra Osborne gained for her party in 1997. The couple have two daughters and two granddaughters and live in Symington, Ayrshire.

<text>Sun Media Corporation was the owner of several tabloid and broadsheet newspapers in Canada and the 49% owner of the now defunct Sun News Network. It was a subsidiary of Quebecor Media.

On October 6, 2014, Quebecor Media announced the sale of the remaining English-language print assets of Sun Media to rival Postmedia. The sale included neither the Sun News Network, which subsequently closed when a buyer was not found, nor Quebecor&#x27;s French-language papers &quot;Le Journal de Montréal&quot; and &quot;Le Journal de Québec&quot;. The sale was approved by the federal Competition Bureau on March 25, 2015, and closed on April 13. Canoe Sun Media merged with Postmedia rather than being maintained as a separate division.

Quebecor had previously sold its community newspapers in Quebec to TC Transcontinental in June 2014, under a deal first announced in December 2013.

==History==
Sun Publishing was formed on February 4, 1978 through the amalgamation of Toronto Sun Holdings Ltd and Toronto Sun Publishing Ltd. The two companies had been formed in 1971 with the launch of the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; by former staffers of the defunct &quot;Toronto Telegram&quot;. On February 14, 1978, the &quot;Edmonton Sun&quot;, the second member of what would become the Sun chain, was announced through a partnership of Sun Media and Edmonton Sun Publishing Ltd. The paper was launched on April 2, 1978. In 1981, the outstanding shares of Edmonton Sun Publishing Ltd were acquired by Sun Media. The company purchased the &quot;Calgary Albertan&quot; on July 31, 1980 for $1.3 million and relaunched it days later as the &quot;Calgary Sun&quot;, with the same format and appearance as its sister papers.

In 1979, it purchased the United Press International&#x27;s Canadian subsidiary, the former British United Press. It ran the news agency for several years before selling it to Canadian Press in 1985.

In 1983, 50% of Sun Media was acquired by Maclean-Hunter for $55 million. That same year, Sun Media, with Maclean-Hunter&#x27;s backing, acquired the &quot;Houston Post&quot; for $100 million in an attempt to expand into the United States. It was sold for $150 million four years later. In 1987, Maclean-Hunter&#x27;s &quot;Financial Post&quot; weekly was sold to Sun Media for $46 million and was relaunched as a daily tabloid financial newspaper the following year. In 1988, Sun Media acquired the &quot;Ottawa Sunday Herald&quot; which it would relaunch as the daily &quot;Ottawa Sun&quot;.

In 1994, Maclean-Hunter was purchased by Rogers Communications. Two years later, on October 4, 1996, the management of the Sun chain under the leadership of Paul Godfrey purchased Rogers&#x27; share of the Sun Publishing and renamed the company Sun Media. In 1998, the &quot;Financial Post&quot; was sold to Southam Inc. in exchange for the &quot;Hamilton Spectator&quot;, the &quot;Kitchener-Waterloo Record&quot;, the &quot;Guelph Mercury&quot;, and the &quot;Cambridge Reporter&quot;. Also in 1998, Sun Media was purchased by Quebecor and maintained as a wholly owned subsidiary of it. Godfrey had sought out Quebecor as a &quot;white knight&quot; in order to frustrate an attempted hostile takeover by the Sun&#x27;s longtime rival, the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;. In 1999, Quebcor sold the four recently acquired southern Ontario newspapers to the owners of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; and became part of its Metroland Media Group. Southam, owned by Conrad Black, would relaunch the &quot;Financial Post&quot; as the &quot;National Post&quot;. In 2007, Sun Media acquired and absorbed the Osprey Media chain of small English language newspapers mostly based in Ontario. In 2014, after years of cuts and restructuring, Quebecor sold its Sun Media division to Postmedia which, ironically, had former Sun Media CEO Paul Godfrey as its chief executive. The sale was completed in April 2015 and Sun Media was dissolved with its newspapers being absorbed by the Postmedia chain.

<text>Sir Richard Geoffrey James Ottaway (born 24 May 1945) is a British Conservative Party politician and consultant. He was the Member of Parliament for Croydon South from 1992 to 2015. Ottaway also served as the MP for Nottingham North from 1983 to 1987.

==Early life==
Ottaway was born on 24 May 1945 in Sonning, Berkshire. He attended Backwell School, a secondary modern school in Backwell, North Somerset. He joined the Royal Navy as an artificer apprentice in 1961 and undertook officer training at the Britannia Royal Naval College in Dartmouth in 1965. He also served as the Royal Navy officer between 1965 and 1970 as a Lieutenant, deployed in HMS Beachampton, HMS Nubian, and the aircraft carrier HMS Eagle. He served as a lieutenant commander in the Royal Naval Reserve (RNR) from 1971 to 1980.

Ottaway studied law at Bristol University, graduating in 1974. He qualified as a solicitor in 1977, specializing in maritime and commercial law, and was a partner of William A. Crump &amp; Son in London in 1981–87. He was a director of Coastal States Petroleum (UK) Ltd in 1988–95.

==Parliamentary career==
Ottaway was Conservative MP for Nottingham North from 1983 to 1987. This was a safe Labour Party seat, which he won unexpectedly with a majority of 362 in the Conservative landslide following the Falklands War. Unsurprisingly the seat reverted to Labour in 1987, when he was defeated by Graham Allen. Ottaway re-entered Parliament in 1992 when he won the constituency of Croydon South.

On re-entering parliament in 1992, Ottaway served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Michael Heseltine MP and from October 1995 he was a Government Whip. In opposition from 1997, he was a Front Bench spokesman as Shadow Minister for London and Local Government, Shadow Defence Minister, Shadow Paymaster General and Shadow Secretary of State for the Environment.

Between 2005 and 2010 Parliament he was a member of the Intelligence and Security Committee, Vice Chairman of the 1922 Committee and a member of the Conservative Party. After the 2010 election, he became the first Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee to be elected by MPs from all parliamentary parties.

In 2011, he was declared &quot;The Week&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Backbencher of the Year&quot; based on his committee&#x27;s enquiry into Afghanistan that was highly critical of Government policy and urged the UK to do more to encourage the US to talk with the Taliban in pursuance of peace.

Ottaway chaired the All Party Parliamentary London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Group and was a member of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Population, Development and Reproductive Health. In 2012 he won the Population Institute&#x27;s Global Media Award for ground-breaking research into population growth. His report Sex, Ideology and Religion: 10 Myths about World Population won the Institute&#x27;s Best Essay category.

As a long-standing campaigner for the right of terminally ill people to die at home of their choosing, Ottaway tabled a historic backbench committee debate on assisted suicide in the House of Commons in March 2012. This resulted in Parliament agreeing for the first time that it is not in the public interest to prosecute people who compassionately help a loved one requesting assistance to die. However, assisting suicide is still illegal and the issue is controversial. He subsequently made the case for assisted dying – suicide with the help of medical professionals. In October 2012, he debated at the Oxford Union in favour of the motion: This House Would Legalise Assisted Dying, and won by 167 to 131 votes.

In October 2012, Ottaway announced his decision not to stand in 2015. He was appointed to the Privy Council in October 2013. On 12 November 2013, Chris Philp was selected to become the next Conservative parliamentary candidate for Croydon South.

Ottaway was knighted in the 2014 New Year Honours for parliamentary and political service.

===Foreign Affairs Select Committee===
After the 2010 General Election, Ottaway was elected the Chairman of the House of Commons Select Committee on Foreign Affairs. The Committee&#x27;s enquires included the Foreign and Commonwealth Office&#x27;s Human Rights work, the UK&#x27;s relations with Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, foreign policy implications of and for a separate Scotland, and the future of the EU. Through correspondence with Foreign Secretary William Hague, he raised concerns about the legality of arming rebels in Syria. He led an inquiry into the UK&#x27;s relationship with Hong Kong, a former British colony, 30 years after the Joint Declaration amid series pro-democracy protests.

Ottaway voted for the Iraq War based on evidence presented to Parliament but subsequently regretted his decision as he believed parliament and the country had been misled. Ottaway was a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee in 2003 when the committee took evidence from David Kelly, the former UN weapons inspector who revealed details of the dossier on weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. His questioning of Prime Minister Tony Blair on 4 February 2003 revealed that Blair had not appreciated that Iraq possessed only defensive battlefield or small-calibre weaponry rather than long-range weapons of mass destruction when he made his speech in the Iraq debate that led to the House of Commons voting in favour of war. Ottaway asserted that if that information had been conveyed to MPs “those weapons might not have been described as weapons of mass destruction threatening the region and the stability of the world”.

===Europe===
Ottaway was a founding member of the European Mainstream Group, formed in February 2013 to articulate a positive Conservative attitude to Europe as set out by David Cameron in his Bloomberg Speech.

As Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Ottaway presided over an inquiry into the Future of the EU and supported a referendum on EU Referendum Bill. On 15 May 2013, he made the economic case for staying in the EU in the Queen’s Speech debate on economic growth. He answered his main opponent on the day in an article in ConservativeHome.

===Scrap Metal Dealers Act 2013===
In 2013, Ottaway celebrated the passing of his Private Member’s Bill to crack down on metal theft and the desecration of war memorials by tighter regulation of scrap metal dealers. His interest in metal theft dated back to 2009, when thieves stole lead from a constituency parish church.

The Bill won overwhelming support in both Houses as well as from the Government. It was backed by organisations including The Royal British Legion, War Memorials Trust, Church of England, Network Rail, BT, the Energy Networks Association, the Institute of Directors, the Federation of Small Businesses, Arts Council England, Tate Galleries, the Henry Moore Foundation, the Local Government Association, British Transport Police and the British Metals Recycling Association. It received Royal Assent on 28 February 2013 and was implemented on 1 October 2013, in time for the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War.

===2009 expenses scandal===
During the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; expenses scandal it was revealed that Ottaway claimed for a second home nine miles south of the constituency, with another house minutes from Parliament. Ottaway apologised to constituents for his part in &#x27;allowing an indefensible system of allowances to develop&#x27; and announced he would let Croydon South party members decide his fate in a vote of confidence. The local association&#x27;s President, Lord Bowness, chaired the meeting, which ended in a secret ballot that Ottaway won.

Among his expenses claims between April 2004 and March 2008 were £59.99 on light bulbs and £48 for modifying a scarifier. He paid back £2,025 that he had claimed as half of the price of an orthopaedic bed and £1,400 for homeware and electrical goods. David Cameron&#x27;s Conservative head office scrutiny panel did not ask him to pay back any more.

===2014 incident with constituents===

It was reported that Ottaway called the police for &#x27;security&#x27; when a group of constituents – most of whom were of pension age – visited his office to hand in a petition against the &#x27;Gagging Law&#x27; (Transparency of Lobbying, non-Party Campaigning, and Trade Union Administration Bill) on 17 January 2014. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: &quot;Officers spoke to all parties. No offences were identified and the officers left.&quot; Ottaway, however, was reported as saying that he would do the same again.

==Personal life==
Ottaway married Nicky, a magistrate and former international television production executive, in 1982. He is also an enthusiastic amateur yachtsman, winning several regattas in Daring keelboat class in Cowes. He is a member of the Royal Thames Yacht Club, the Royal London Yacht Club, and the Island Sailing Club.

He is the nephew of the actor James Ottaway.

<text>Albert Owen (born 10 August 1959) is a Welsh Labour Party politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Ynys Môn from 2001 to 2019. He took the seat in the 2001 election from Plaid Cymru with a margin of exactly eight hundred votes and retained the seat at the four subsequent general elections. During his time in Parliament, he was a member of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Select Committee, Welsh Affairs Select Committee and the International Development Committee. He was also a member of the Speaker&#x27;s Panel of Chairs and vice-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on cancer.

==Early life==
Like most of his hometown Holyhead, including the Labour MEP Glenys Kinnock, he attended the Holyhead County Comprehensive School. He left when he was sixteen for a career in the Merchant Navy, and was a seaman until 1992. In 1995, he became an advisor in the Citizens Advice Bureau, specialising in welfare rights, and from 1997 to 2001 he managed the J. E. O&#x27;Toole Centre in Holyhead – a centre dedicated to the welfare, education and leisure of unemployed workers in Holyhead. In 1999, he unsuccessfully stood for the Labour party in the Welsh Assembly elections. From the University of York he gained a BA in politics in 1997.

==In Parliament==
During his Parliamentary career, Owen has rebelled against the Labour Party&#x27;s political whip on certain occasions including notably:

* voting against the government&#x27;s Higher Education Funding Bill introducing &quot;top up fees&quot; on 27 January 2004
* voting against the House of Lords amendment on foundation hospitals on 19 November 2003
* voting for an anti-war amendment during the Iraq crisis debate on 18 March 2003, though he was subsequently absent for a vote on requiring Security Council support for any further action
* voting against the Labour Party whip and for&#x27; an amendment tabled by members of The Independent Group for a second public vote on 14 March 2019.

He supported Owen Smith in the failed attempt to replace Jeremy Corbyn in the 2016 Labour Party (UK) leadership election.

He stood down at the 2019 election.

==Personal life==
He married Angela Margaret Magee. They have two daughters (born January 1985 and August 1986). He is a supporter of Everton Football Club. He said &quot;I have a passion for football. I remember, as a young man in the 1970s, watching Wales play Northern Ireland at Goodison Park, my favourite football team’s stadium.&quot;

<text>Montgomery &quot;Scotty&quot; Scott is a fictional character in the science fiction franchise &quot;Star Trek&quot;. First portrayed by James Doohan in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, Scotty also appears in the animated &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, 10 &quot;Star Trek&quot; films, the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Relics&quot;, and in numerous books, comics, and video games.

Simon Pegg has assumed the character and appeared in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; reboot (2009) and its sequels, &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot; (2013) and &quot;Star Trek Beyond&quot; (2016). In 2023, a young version of Scotty appeared in the final episode of the second season of &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot;, portrayed by Martin Quinn. Later in 2023, an animated version of Scotty was played by Carlos Alazraqui in a Very Short Treks episode.

== Development and portrayals ==
Doohan was cast as the &quot;Enterprise&quot; engineer for the second &quot;Star Trek&quot; pilot, &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot; (1966) on the recommendation of that episode&#x27;s director, James Goldstone, who had worked with him before. The character almost did not make it to the show after series creator Gene Roddenberry sent Doohan a letter informing him, &quot;We don&#x27;t think we need an engineer in the series&quot;. Only through the intervention of Doohan&#x27;s agent did the character remain.

Doohan tried a variety of accents for the part and decided to use a Scottish accent on the basis that he thought Scottish people make the best engineers. Doohan himself chose Scotty&#x27;s first name, Montgomery (Doohan&#x27;s own middle name), in honor of his maternal grandfather James Montgomery. In a third-season production memo, Roddenberry said Doohan &quot;is capable of handling anything we throw at him&quot; and that the &quot;dour Scot&quot; works better when being protective of the ship&#x27;s engines.

===Doohan depiction===
Scotty (the fictional Lt. Commander Montgomery Scott) spent part of his life in Aberdeen, but was born in Linlithgow Scotland. He wears Clan Scott&#x27;s tartan as part of his dress uniform. Doohan claimed to have based Scotty&#x27;s accent on an Aberdeen accent he once heard. During the events of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, Scotty holds the rank of lieutenant commander and serves as the &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s second officer and &quot;miracle worker&quot; chief engineer, commanding the ship and recording its log when both Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) and First Officer Spock (Leonard Nimoy) are not aboard. Scotty&#x27;s technical knowledge and skill allow him to devise unconventional and effective last-minute solutions to dire problems. Scotty&#x27;s identity is strongly connected to the &quot;Enterprise&quot; itself, and the character often takes a paternal attitude toward the ship. He is frequently the liaison between Captain Kirk&#x27;s ambitious tactical plans and what is technically feasible in the realm of the starship&#x27;s capabilities. Scotty asserts in the &quot;TNG&quot; episode &quot;Relics&quot; that he &quot;never wanted to be anything else but an engineer&quot;. In addition to his engineering abilities, Scotty is often shown to be a fairly heavy drinker but is only shown drunk twice, in &quot;By Any Other Name&quot; and &quot;Relics&quot;.

Scotty oversaw the &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s refit prior to the events of &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; (1979), and is part of the crew when the &quot;Enterprise&quot; confronts Khan Noonien Singh (Ricardo Montalbán) in &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot; (1982). Although not stated when this occurred in the original release of the film, Peter Preston – who was mortally wounded during the attack on the &quot;Enterprise&quot; by the USS &quot;Reliant&quot;, and dies with Scotty at his bedside – was Scotty&#x27;s nephew. After Scotty was promoted to captain of engineering of the USS &quot;Excelsior&quot; in &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; (1984), he sabotages the new ship and helps Kirk steal the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to rescue Spock. Scotty joins Kirk&#x27;s crew aboard the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-A at the end of &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot; (1986). In &quot;Star Trek V: The Final Frontier&quot; (1989), he helps Kirk, Spock and Dr. Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley) escape the brig and retake the hijacked &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Scotty kills Colonel West (René Auberjonois) before the latter can assassinate the Federation president (Kurtwood Smith) in &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot; (1991). Scotty joins Kirk and Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig) for the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-B&#x27;s maiden voyage in &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot; (1994), saving the ship through his technical expertise.

After serving aboard 11 starships in a career spanning 52 years and retiring at the age of 72 with the rank of Captain, Scotty was aboard a transport shuttle en route to a retirement colony when it crashed into a Dyson sphere; stranded, he set the transporter to cycle indefinitely and &quot;stored&quot; himself in the buffer for 75 years before being recovered by the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D crew in &quot;Relics&quot;. Even though he is no longer able to serve effectively as an engineer and struggles to get used to 24th-century life, Scotty nevertheless helps save the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D from being trapped within the sphere. At the end, the 147-year-old Captain Montgomery Scott is given an &quot;Enterprise&quot; shuttlecraft and left to explore space.

===Pegg depiction===

In September 2007, Paul McGillion auditioned for the Scotty role in the 2009 &quot;Star Trek&quot; reboot and received James Doohan&#x27;s son Chris&#x27;s endorsement. However, Simon Pegg&#x27;s casting was announced on October 11, 2007. Pegg&#x27;s portrayal in the 2009 &quot;Star Trek&quot; reboot has Scotty stuck working at an isolated outpost as punishment for beaming Admiral Jonathan Archer&#x27;s prized beagle from one planet to the next — and having no idea where it ended up. With assistance from Spock Prime and James Kirk, he joins the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew and becomes the ship&#x27;s chief engineer. Slate.com called Pegg&#x27;s performance of Scotty in the 2009 &quot;Star Trek&quot; reboot &quot;juicily comic&quot;. The character of Scotty has an expanded role in the film &quot;Star Trek Beyond&quot; (written by Pegg and Doug Jung), in which he meets an alien woman named Jaylah, who leads him to the crashed Federation starship, the USS &quot;Franklin&quot;. Working together, the two make the ship again flightworthy and Scotty helps Jaylah to see the value of working together with a crew.

===Early years===
A young Scotty, played by Scottish actor Martin Quinn, appears in the &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot; episode &quot;Hegemony&quot;. In that episode, Scotty holds the rank of Lieutenant junior grade and is the only survivor of a Gorn attack on his ship, the USS &quot;Stardiver&quot;. After escaping from the wrecked &quot;Stardiver&quot;, Scotty took a shuttlecraft and managed to reach a Federation colony on Parnassus Beta. He was then rescued by the &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

== Birthplace dispute ==
Following Doohan&#x27;s death, several Scottish towns campaigned to be named Scotty&#x27;s &quot;official birthplace&quot;. Scripts, production materials and Doohan&#x27;s family support
Aberdeen&#x27;s claim to being Scotty&#x27;s birthplace. In &quot;Wolf in the Fold&quot; (1967), Scotty says that he is &quot;an old Aberdeen pub crawler&quot;, as he grew up and spent some of his reprobate youth there. Notwithstanding that caveat, Aberdeen city leaders proposed plans to erect a monument to the actor and character.

== In popular culture ==
Scotty&#x27;s operation of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; transporter system inspired the catchphrase &quot;Beam me up, Scotty&quot;, which gained currency in popular culture beyond &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans (most notably by former U.S. Representative James Traficant), even though the exact phrase is not spoken in that way in the original series, it is used frequently in the animated series. In &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot;, Kirk says, &quot;Scotty, beam me up.&quot;

Doohan himself briefly reprised the role for a gag cameo in the action comedy &quot;Loaded Weapon 1&quot; (1993), as well as being Scotty in the movie &quot;Knight Rider 2000&quot; (1991), while parodies of Scotty or his accent appear in such media as &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; (2004), &quot;Spaceballs&quot; (1987),&quot;Tale Spin&quot;, &quot;Goof Troop&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Ace Ventura: Pet Detective&quot; (1994), &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot; and &quot;All That&quot;. Scotty also appeared in a &quot;Far Side&quot; comic, where he was in Hell.

In the song &quot;Boat Drinks&quot;, singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffett asks, &quot;Could you beam me somewhere, Mister Scott? Any old place, here on Earth or in space, you pick the century and I&#x27;ll pick the spot.&quot; Rap artists D4L have a song &quot;Scotty&quot; that uses his character and &quot;Star Trek&quot;, as do Relient K in their song &quot;Beaming&quot;.

==Reception==
In 2009, IGN rated Scotty the 16th best character of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, including the spin-off shows produced up to that time.

In 2016, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; rated Scotty as the 18th best character in &quot;Star Trek&quot; overall as presented in television and film up to that time, highlighting the character as someone who could get the Enterprise out of trouble, with phrases that added both tension and humor to the show. In 2016, Scotty was ranked as the 19th most important character of Starfleet within the &quot;Star Trek&quot; science fiction universe by &quot;Wired&quot; magazine.

In 2018, &quot;The Wrap&quot; placed Scotty as 12th out of 39 in a ranking of main cast characters of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise prior to &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;. In 2018, CBR ranked Scotty the ninth best Starfleet character of &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

In July 2019, Screen Rant ranked Scotty the 5th smartest character of all &quot;Star Trek&quot; (including later series).

<text>Kozy (German: &quot;Seiffersdorf, Seibersdorf, Kosy (1941–45)&quot;; Wymysorys: &quot;Zajwyśdiüf&quot;) is a large village with a population of 12,457 (2013) within Bielsko County, located in the historical and geographical south-west region of Lesser Poland, between Kęty and Bielsko-Biała, and about 65 kilometres south-west of Kraków and south of Katowice. It is the largest village in Poland (by comparison - the population of Opatowiec, the smallest town in Poland, is only 338). The village name translates to &#x27;Goats&#x27; in English, and has an area of 26,9 km2.

Since 1 January 1999, following Polish local government reforms adopted in 1998, Kozy has been part of the newly established Silesian Voivodeship (province); between 1975 and 1998 it was formerly part of the Bielsko-Biała Voivodeship. The village is well connected with the nearby city of Bielsko-Biała. It has a railway transport station, and lies on National Road No. 52. Kozy is the centre of the administrative district of Gmina Kozy.

==History==

Originally, these areas were part of Lesser Poland. The village settlement was first mentioned in 1326 under two names &quot;Duabuscapris seu Siffridivilla&quot; in Latin, translated as &quot;two goats or goats village&quot;, recorded in the parish Peter&#x27;s Pence list, deanery of Oświęcim, Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kraków.
In old Polish the village was known as &quot;Dwyekozy&quot; (&quot;Dwiekozie&quot;); &quot;two goats&quot;, and consisted of two settlements - &quot;Upper Kozy&quot; (&quot;Kozy Górne&quot;), and &quot;Lower Kozy&quot; (&quot;Kozy Dolne&quot;).

Kozy was historically located on lands held by the Silesian Piast since the end of 12th century, branch of the Polish royal Piast dynasty. The village was in the Duchy of Oświęcim. From 1327 the duchy was part of the Bohemian Crown lands (Kingdom of Bohemia). In 1457 the duchy was sold to the Polish king Casimir IV Jagiellon and returned to the Kingdom of Poland, and 
the village Kozy (and this area) again became part of Lesser Poland. In the accompanying document issued on 21 February the village was mentioned as &quot;Dwe Kozy&quot;. Kozy was a privately owned village, owned by such wealthy noble families as Mikołaj Szłop of Dębowiec during the 15th century and from the early 16th century became part of the House of Saszowski estates.

The village had a parish church, and castle fortification built during 1327–1330, which formed part of the Duchy defense system, surrounded by a rampart and moat, the castle had two wings and a bastion with 2–3 metre thick walls. The castle ruins remained visible until the mid-1930s, when it was sold and gradually dismantled for building materials, sporadic parts of the castle foundations remain. The first wooden church was built about 1326, and rebuilt during the 16th century after suffering fire damage. In 1559, the parish Catholic church was Reformed (to Calvinism), introduced to the parish by a member of the House of Saszowski, the nobleman and Burgrave of Kraków Jakub Saszowski of Gierałtowic. The church remained so until 1658, when during the Swedish Deluge, it was restored the Roman Catholic faith. The majority of village inhabitants, nevertheless, remained faithful to the Reforms. Although Kozy was in the Kingdom of Poland, the village community were mostly German-speaking, embraced the Protestant Reformation, and would thus come under persistent attack from the Catholic Church during and after the Counter-Reformation.

In the late 18th-century, the subsequent new village owners Jordanów, an affluent Polish burgher family from Kraków, started a strong local persecution of Protestants. In response, an exodus resulted, 64 families and 360 individual refugees with their belongings, crossed north-west from Kozy over the border at Dzieditz (Czechowice-Dziedzice) into Prussia controlled Upper Silesia, on the night of 25 April 1770, and there founded the village Anhalt (Holdynow/Hołdunów) near Pleß (Pszczyna). The escape route was secured by a Prussian Army cuirassier cavalry squadron escort under General Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz; the resettlement was supported by the King of Prussia, Frederick the Great, who asked only whether the refugees from Poland understood German. Thus came a 200-year end in the history of evangelicalism in Kozy. Only a few, undecided inhabitants, remained in Kozy, and were subjected to further reprisals by the Jordanów landowners.

A few years later, in the First Partitions of Poland (1772), the Duchy of Oświęcim and thus the almost deserted village of Kozy, was annexed by the Habsburg Austrian Empire, as part of the Austrian Partition. Until November 1918, the Duchy of Oświęcim remained part of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria crown-lands of Austria. During the 19th-century, Kozy revived once again as one of the most affluent villages of &quot;Oświęcim Land&quot;, famous for its skilled stonemasons, carpenters and loom weaving cloth makers. The 16th-century parish wooden church, was demolished in 1899, paving way for the new neo-Gothic style church. The 16th-century church ceiling murals, however, were preserved and transferred into the collections of the National Museum in Kraków.

According to an Austrian census in 1900, the population of Kozy was 3,693, 403 buildings, and an area of 1,358 hectare (13.58 km2); 3,646 residents were Roman Catholic, 1 Greek-Catholic, 40 Israelite, and 12 residents of other religion. 3,688 declared Polish- and 8 German-speaking, and 6 declared other language. In the Second Polish Republic (1918), the lands of Oświęcim and thus Kozy, were reincorporated into Poland&#x27;s Kraków Voivodeship at the end of World War I. During World War II, it was a local centre for the Polish resistance Armia Krajowa (Home Army). After the war, Kozy belonged to the administrative district (gmina) of Biała Wieś, and in 1954, it emerged as a separate administrative district Gmina Kozy.

===Papal visit===
In June 1979, Pope John Paul II&#x27;s papal visit to Poland encompassed various papal motorcade trails. One such trail planned with the Vatican, was from Kozy to Straconka (Bielsko-Biała), where Pope John Paul II began his journey from the Church of St. Simon and Jude Tadeusza in Kozy.

<text>A work unit or danwei () is the name given to a place of employment in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The term &quot;danwei&quot; remains in use today, as people still use it to refer to their workplace. Prior to Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s economic reforms, a work unit acted as the first step of a multi-tiered hierarchy linking each individual with the Chinese Communist Party infrastructure. Work units were the principal method of implementing party policy. The work unit provided lifetime employment and extensive socioeconomic welfare -- &quot;a significant feature of socialism and a historic right won through the Chinese Revolution.&quot;

== Background ==
The role of the &quot;danwei&quot; was modelled in part on the Soviet &quot;kombinat&quot;. Some scholars believe that the social, economic, and political functions of the &quot;danwei&quot; could be traced back to the pre-communist financial institutions in the 1930s, the labor movement between the 1920s and 1940s, and the rural revolutionary models of organization in the Yan&#x27;an period. In addition, some scholars propose that Chinese state planners borrowed heavily from the Soviet model of development, or state socialism, in the design of party and state organs as well as the management of state enterprises. To accelerate the pace of industrialization and to create a new urban working class, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) looked up to the Soviet experience and translated thousands of Soviet enterprise management literature. The CCP used basic principles of industrial organization and management from Soviet literature to draft its own industrial management system and create a new factory hierarchy of authority and administration. To follow the Soviet socialist economic model, which aimed to achieve full employment, the Chinese work unit system guaranteed permanent employment. This means that a factory could not easily fire its workers and the workers could not switch to another work unit unless they obtained special permissions. The physical design of &quot;danwei&quot; was also influenced by Soviet architecture.

== &quot;Danwei&quot; system ==
Institutions such as industrial factories, schools and hospitals, and government departments are all part of the &quot;danwei&quot; system. Among them, the heavy industrial work units, commonly viewed as the prototype of the socialist workplace, were granted priority for resources. During the Maoist era, the work unit served as multifunctional urban institutions that encompassed various aspects of urban livelihoods. &quot;Danwei&quot; contained facilities for work and daily living, including production facilities, offices, residential areas, social services, child-care facilities, dry goods stores, public toilets, bath houses, meeting rooms, clubs for retirees, and sports courts and fields. Larger &quot;danwei&quot; might have schools or in-patient healthcare clinics. Workers&#x27; benefits were only partly in the form of wages, with significant benefits coming in the form of state-provided services and the like. Therefore, work units provided essential social resources to its members when the market economy had not yet fully developed. The industrial &quot;danwei&quot; was a state institution.

Among the goals that state planners sought to advance through constructing &quot;danwei&quot; as part of China&#x27;s urbanization was the development of a socialist citizenry with a proletarian consciousness. In the &quot;danwei&quot;, urban Chinese lived and worked together in a collective and egalitarian environment.

== The political use of the &quot;danwei&quot; system ==
Briefly mentioned earlier, the late nineteenth century saw a surge of &quot;public social consciousness&quot; which brought the public&#x27;s attention to many social, political, moral, and sanitary dangers of urbanized areas. So when the CCP defeated the Kuomintang in 1949, they sought to consolidate urban rule quickly for their own interests and that of the general populations&#x27;. By 1957, over 90 percent of the urban population belonged to a &quot;danwei.&quot; The &quot;danwei&quot; became as much of a social and political tool as it was an economic one. The CCP&#x27;s creation of a &quot;danwei&quot; system that was based strictly on functionalism represented a break from the previous imperial China&#x27;s focus on Confucian principles of hierarchy and order. Thus, &quot;Danweis&quot; were themselves a product of socialist ideology but furthermore, they were &quot;key sites&quot; for the CCP-led government to promote their egalitarian ideology. As a result of &quot;danweis&quot; being such a socially enclosed and monitored environment, people became hyperaware of their behaviour and strived for absolute conformity which gave way for the &quot;penetration of the Leninist state in urban society.&quot; &quot;Danweis&quot; became successful vessels for political mobilization as the encouraged relations between employees were founded upon and channelled into political participation, often against an enemy. An example of this would be the massive workers&#x27; strikes during Mao Zedong&#x27;s Hundred Flowers Campaign where in the span of 6 months between 1956 and 1957, over 10,000 strikes had occurred nationwide in favour of Chairman Mao&#x27;s attack on bureaucratism.

== The disintegration of the &quot;danwei&quot; system ==
During the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976, both administrative agencies and production regulation in relation to &quot;danweis&quot; were extremely disrupted. In these years, people often led double lives; praising Mao Zedong and participating in the revolution while engaging in activities that the revolution rejected such as listening to forbidden music. Along with the emotional and physical devastation in China, this ultimately led to exhaustion of the labor force from endless attempted &quot;brainwashing&quot; in &quot;danweis&quot;. In the years during the Chinese economic reform beginning in 1976 and ending in 1989, led by Deng Xiaoping, the policies surrounding the permanency of the employee to the work unit became more lax, particularly in enterprise units (&quot;qiye danwei&quot;) where there was an increasing lack of a personnel dossier (&quot;dang an&quot;) system that prevented people from transferring or quitting. The &quot;danwei&quot; system only further weakened after 1978 when a market economy was put in place in lieu of a planned economy, and as the space became more heterogenous, it lost its once collective spirit and became more unstable. It was in 1978 that Chinese leadership suggested private housing and in 1980, the National Urban Housing and Residence Meeting granted workers permission to build and own property, as well as buy public housing units. Eventually, in 1988, the State Council stopped issuing the construction of new housing units and instead redirected those funds to support workers buying their own housing units. By the time the 1990s came around, urban social identity shifted when people began to identify themselves by their individual identity cards rather than their &quot;danwei&quot;, marking the ultimate dissolution of the &quot;danwei.&quot; The &quot;danwei&quot; lost its economic and social dominance in the lives of Chinese urban workers due to economic reform and changing social attitudes towards individuality and identity amidst political change. By 2000 much of the work unit&#x27;s power had been removed. In 2003, for example, it became possible to marry or divorce someone without needing authorization from one&#x27;s work unit.

== The &quot;danwei&quot; system as a failed means of economic recovery ==
Between 1962 and 1965, during the Mao era, Beijing&#x27;s leaders adopted emergency measures after the Great Leap Forward resulted in mass starvation and agricultural downturn. More than 20 million people who had settled in urban areas were forced back to the countryside to work when urban food and consumer goods were strictly rationed in the socially-controlled &quot;danweis&quot;. The CCP then put into place policies that &quot;had the effect of freezing people into their current work units.&quot; This often meant that many workers had little or no knowledge of what was going on outside of their unit and there was close to no mobility between units or residences. The &quot;danwei&quot; unit system in tandem with strict residence registration requirements, namely the Hukou system, prevented migration from rural areas to urban ones, essentially dividing China into two tiers: a privileged urban society and an exploited rural society.

<doc id="422837" wikidata="Q855385" url="?curid=422837" title="Vickers Vimy">
<text>The Vickers Vimy was a British heavy bomber aircraft developed and manufactured by Vickers Limited. Developed during the latter stages of the First World War to equip the Royal Flying Corps (RFC), the Vimy was designed by Rex Pierson, Vickers&#x27; chief designer.

Only a handful of Vickers Vimy aircraft had entered service by the time the Armistice of 11 November 1918 came into effect, so the type did not serve in active combat operations during the war, but the Vimy became the core of the Royal Air Force (RAF)&#x27;s heavy bomber force throughout the 1920s. The Vimy achieved success as both a military and a civil aircraft, the latter using the &quot;Vimy Commercial&quot; variant. A dedicated transport derivative of the Vimy, the Vickers Vernon, became the first troop-transport aircraft operated by the RAF.

During the interwar period the Vimy set several records for long-distance flights, the most celebrated and significant of these being the first non-stop crossing of the Atlantic Ocean, performed by John Alcock and Arthur Brown in June 1919. Other record-breaking flights were made from the United Kingdom to destinations such as South Africa and Australia. The Vimy continued to be operated until the 1930s in both military and civil capacities.

==Design and development==
===Background===
Throughout the First World War both the Allied Powers and the Central Powers made increasingly sophisticated use of new technologies in their attempts to break through the effective stalemate of trench warfare. One key advance made during the conflict was in the use of fixed-wing aircraft, which were at that time rapidly advancing in capability, for combat purposes. On 23 July 1917, in response to a bombing raid by German bombers on London, the Air Board, having determined that existing projects were not ambitious enough, decided to cancel all orders for experimental heavy bombers then underway. A week later, following protests from the Controller of the Technical Department, the Air Board placed an order for 100 Handley Page O/100 bombers, which was accompanied by orders for prototype heavy bombers being placed with both Handley Page and Vickers Limited.
On 16 August 1917 Vickers was issued with a contract for three prototype aircraft and Rex Pierson, chief designer of Vickers&#x27; aviation division, started designing a large twin-engine biplane bomber, to be powered by either a pair of RAF 4d or 200 hp (150 kW) Hispano Suiza engines. Pierson discussed the proposed aircraft with Major J. C. Buchanan of the Air Board to establish the rough configuration of the aircraft, which was expected to meet the requirement for a night bomber which could attack targets within the German Empire.

===Design===
The Vickers F.B.27 Vimy is an equal-span twin-engine four-bay biplane, with balanced ailerons on both upper and lower wings. The engine nacelles were positioned mid-gap and contained the fuel tanks. It has a biplane empennage with elevators on both upper and lower surfaces and twin rudders. The main undercarriage consists of two pairs of wheels, each pair carried on a pair of tubular steel V-struts. There is a tail-skid and an additional skid mounted below the nose of the fuselage to prevent nose-overs.

The aircraft was designed to accommodate a three-man crew and a payload of 12 bombs. In addition to the pilot&#x27;s cockpit, which was positioned just ahead of the wings, there were two positions for gunners, one behind the wings and the other in the nose, each with a pair of Scarff ring-mounted Lewis guns; the rear cockpit mounting was commonly not fitted during the interwar period. Provision for a maximum of four spare drums of ammunition were present in the nose position, while up to six drums could be carried in the rear position.

The majority of the Vimy&#x27;s payload of bombs were stowed vertically inside the fuselage between the spars of the lower centre section; a typical load consisted of 12 bombs. In some variants further bombs could be stowed externally for a total of 18 bombs, if the particular engine used provided enough power. For anti-surface warfare in the maritime environment, the Vimy could also be armed with a pair of torpedoes. To improve bombing accuracy, the Vimy was equipped with the High Altitude Drift Mk.1a bombsight. Standard equipment also included two Michelin-built Mk.1 flare carriers.

The Vimy was powered by a range of different engines. Owing to engine supply difficulties, the prototype Vimys were tested with a number of different engine types, including Sunbeam Maoris, Salmson 9Zm water-cooled radials, and Fiat A.12bis engines, before production orders were placed for aircraft powered by the 230 hp (170 kW) BHP Puma, 400 hp (300 kW) Fiat, 400 hp (300 kW) Liberty L-12 and the 300 hp (270 kW) Rolls-Royce Eagle VIII engines, with a total of 776 ordered before the end of the First World War. Of these, only aircraft powered by the Eagle engine, known as the Vimy IV, were delivered to the RAF. Due to the number of engine types used there are multiple conflicting official reports on the production numbers of each sub-variant of the Vimy.

Design and production of the prototypes was extremely rapid; the detailed design phase of what had become internally designated as the Vickers F.B.27 and the manufacture of the three prototypes was completed within four months.

===Prototypes===
By the time the first prototype had been completed the RAF 4D was not sufficiently developed, so it was fitted with the alternative Hispano Suiza engine. On 30 November 1917 the first prototype, flown by Captain Gordon Bell, made its maiden flight from Royal Flying Corps Station Joyce Green, Kent. In January 1918 the first prototype was dispatched to RAF Martlesham Heath, Suffolk, for the official trials of the type. Reportedly, the F.B.27 quickly made a positive impression: it was able to take off with a greater payload than the Handley Page O/400 despite having about half the effective engine power. The engines proved to be unreliable during these trials, leading to the aircraft&#x27;s return to Joyce Green on 12 April 1918.

The first prototype was extensively modified, receiving new Salmson water-cooled aero-engines in place of the Hispano Suizas; other changes included the adoption of an alternative exhaust stack configuration, a 3-degree dihedral on the mainplanes, and a modified tail unit. Following these modifications, the prototype was used for several years, surviving the war and being allocated a civil registration. In August 1919 the prototype was flown from Brooklands to Amsterdam in the Netherlands as part of Vicker&#x27;s exhibit at the Eerste Luchtverkeer Tentoonstelling Amsterdam.

During early 1918 the second prototype was completed. Unlike the first, it had plain elevators and ailerons which had an inverse taper; the tops of the wings and tailplanes also differed. The defensive armament was increased, giving the rear gunner two separate guns; these changes would be standardised on production aircraft. The second prototype was powered by a pair of Sunbeam Maori engines, which were found to have an unreliable cooling system during initial testing at Joyce Green. On 26 April 1918 the aircraft was dispatched to RAF Martlesham Heath for official tests, but testing was interrupted by its loss in a crash following an engine failure.

During the first half of the 1918 the third prototype was also completed. It was powered by a pair of 400 hp (300 kW) Fiat A.12 engines, and had a redesigned nose section and nacelles which were similar to production aircraft. On 15 August 1918 the third prototype was sent to RAF Martlesham Heath for performance tests; testing was delayed by the need to replace a cracked propeller. On 11 September 1918 it was lost when its payload of bombs detonated owing to a hard landing, the result of a pilot-induced stall.

It was decided to construct a fourth prototype to test the Rolls-Royce Eagle VIII engine. On 11 October 1918 this was flown from Joyce Green to Martlesham Heath to conduct official trials. Aside from being powered by the Eagle engine, it was identical to the earlier prototypes except for having a greatly increased fuel capacity and reshaped and enlarged rudders. By the time the fourth prototype commenced flying trials, mass production of the Vimy had already begun.

=== Production ===

Since the performance of the first prototype was satisfactory it was decided to start production before the evaluation of either of the other prototypes. On 26 March 1918 the first production contract, for 150 aircraft, was issued; these were built at Vickers&#x27; works in Crayford in the Bexley. Production of the type by additional manufacturers was envisaged early on; in May 1918 follow-up contracts were issued to Clayton &amp; Shuttleworth, Morgan &amp; Co, and the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE), in addition to a separate production line at Vickers&#x27; Weybridge complex. At one point over 1,000 aircraft had been ordered under wartime contracts. The type had received the official name of &quot;Vimy&quot;, after the Battle of Vimy Ridge.

By the end of 1918 a total of 13 aircraft had been completed by Vickers; 7 at Crayford and 6 at Weybridge. Production continued after the signing of the Armistice of 11 November 1918, which led to Vickers ultimately completing 112 aircraft under wartime contracts. The majority, if not all, of Vimys ordered from Morgan &amp; Co were completed, while Westland Aircraft manufactured 25 of the 75 units that they were contracted for. The numbers produced by the RAE are obscured by changes in serial number allocation and the apparent adoption of a piecemeal approach to manufacturing, which came into effect shortly after the end of the war; in February 1920, the RAE completed their final Vimy.

Production aircraft used several different types of engines, leading to various mark numbers being applied to the Vimy to distinguish between the emerging subtypes. The use of different engines was often because of availability; relatively few engines from Rolls-Royce Limited were used in the Vimy during 1918 owing to low output levels from that manufacturer, while other manufacturers also struggled to keep up with engine demand that year. At one point, there was considerable enthusiasm for powering the Vimy with American Liberty L-12 engines, because of their plentiful supply at the time, but all orders for the Liberty-equipped Vimy were terminated in January 1919 and no examples were ever completed. The BHP Puma was also intended for use on the Vimy, but it was cancelled without any aircraft being fitted with the engine.

Use of the Vimy extended beyond its original use as a bomber. A model with greater internal space was developed, known as the &quot;Vimy Commercial&quot; within the civil market. It saw service with the RAF; known as the Vickers Vernon, it became the first dedicated troop transport to be operated by the service. The Vimy was also used as an air ambulance for transporting wounded troops to medical facilities, while some examples were configured to perform record-breaking long-distance flights. From 1923 to 1925 limited production batches of the Vimy were manufactured by Vickers. Between 1923 and 1931, at least another 43 early production aircraft were reconditioned to extend their service lives; at least one Vimy was reconditioned four times.

By October 1918 only three aircraft had been delivered to the Royal Air Force (RAF), one of which had been deployed to France for use by the Independent Air Force. It had been envisioned that the Vimy would be able to conduct long-range bombing missions into Germany, having the ability to reach Berlin from bases in France, but the Armistice of 11 November 1918 brought an end to the conflict before the Vimy could be used on any offensive operations. After the war, the RAF rapidly contracted in size, which slowed the introduction of the Vimy. The Vimy only reached full service status in July 1919 when it entered service with 58 Squadron in Egypt, replacing the older Handley Page 0/400.

==Operational history==
===RAF service===


On 12 June 1918, according to &quot;Flight International&quot;, the Air Board were to initially deploy the first production Vimy units as maritime patrol aircraft, equipped for anti-submarine warfare, and once this requirement had been satisfied, subsequent aircraft would be allocated to performing night bombing missions from bases in France. This had been due to a recently introduced policy under which the number of land-based aircraft allocated to anti-submarine patrols was to be vastly expanded, from 66 landplanes in November 1917 to a projected force of 726 landplanes, in which the newly available Vimy would be a key aircraft due to its long-range capabilities. During August 1918, the application of floats to the Vimy was studied, but it is not known if any aircraft were ever so fitted.

Throughout the 1920s, the Vimy formed the main heavy bomber force of the RAF; for some years, it was the only twin-engine bomber to be stationed at bases in Britain. On 1 April 1924, No. 9 Squadron and No. 58 Squadron, equipped with the Vimy, stood up, tripling the home-based heavy bomber force. On 1 July 1923, a newly formed Night Flying Flight, based at RAF Biggin Hill, equipped with the Vimy, was formed; during the general strike of 1926, this unit performed aerial deliveries of the British Gazette newspaper throughout the country. Between 1921 and 1926, the type formed the backbone of the airmail service between Cairo and Baghdad. The Vimy served as a front line bomber in the Middle East and in the United Kingdom from 1919 until 1925, by which point it had been replaced by the newer Vickers Virginia.

Despite the emergence of the Virginia, which numerous Vimy squadrons were soon re-equipped with, the Vimy continued to equip a Special Reserve bomber squadron, 502 Squadron, stationed at Aldergrove in Northern Ireland until 1929. The Vimy continued to be used in secondary roles, such as its use as a training aircraft; many were re-engined with Bristol Jupiter or Armstrong Siddeley Jaguar radial engines. The final Vimys, used as target aircraft for searchlight crews, remained in use until 1938.

===Long-distance flights===
The most significant of the Vimy&#x27;s many pioneering flights was the first non-stop crossing of the Atlantic Ocean, made by Alcock and Brown in June 1919. An example was specially constructed for the attempt, with additional fuel tanks to extend its range and a revised undercarriage. Only one such aircraft was built; it is preserved and displayed in the London Science Museum.

In 1919, the Australian government offered £10,000 for the first All-Australian crew to fly an aeroplane from England to Australia. Keith Macpherson Smith, Ross Macpherson Smith and mechanics Jim Bennett and Wally Shiers completed the journey from Hounslow Heath Aerodrome to Darwin via Singapore and Batavia on 10 December 1919. Their aircraft G-EAOU is preserved in a purpose-built, climate-controlled museum in the grounds of the airport in Smith&#x27;s home town Adelaide, Australia; &quot;The trip from Darwin to Sydney took almost twice as long as the flight to Australia.&quot; Vickers Vimy Reserve in Northgate, a suburb of Adelaide, is named in honour of the place the plane landed on its return to South Australia in 1920.

In 1920 Lieutenant Colonel Pierre van Ryneveld and Major Quintin Brand attempted the first England to South Africa flight. They left Brooklands on 4 February 1920 in Vimy G-UABA, named &quot;Silver Queen&quot;. They landed safely at Heliopolis, but as they continued the flight to Wadi Halfa they were forced to land due to engine overheating with still to go. A second Vimy was lent to the pair by the RAF at Heliopolis, and named &quot;Silver Queen II&quot;. This second aircraft reached Bulawayo in Southern Rhodesia, where it was badly damaged when it failed to take off. Van Ryneveld and Brand then used a South African Air Force Airco DH.9 to continue the journey to Cape Town. The South African government awarded them £5,000 each.

===Vimy Commercial===


The Vimy Commercial was a civilian version with a larger-diameter fuselage (largely of spruce plywood), which was developed at and first flew from the Joyce Green airfield in Kent on 13 April 1919. Initially, it bore the interim civil registration &quot;K-107&quot;, later being re-registered as &quot;G-EAAV&quot;.

The prototype entered the 1920 race to Cape Town; it left Brooklands on 24 January 1920 but crashed at Tabora, Tanganyika on 27 February.

In 1919, the Chinese Government placed a large order for aircraft with Vickers, including 100 Vimy Commercials, which was cut to 40 Vimy Commercials when the final contract was signed in 1920. A Chinese order for 100 is particularly noteworthy; forty of the forty-three built were delivered to China, but most remained in their crates unused, and only seven were put into civilian use.

Five Napier Lion-powered air ambulance versions of the Vimy Commercial were built for the RAF as the Vimy Ambulance. Fifty-five more bomber-transport versions of the Vimy Commercial were built for the RAF as the Vickers Vernon.

====Role in the Second Zhili–Fengtian War====
After the First Zhili–Fengtian War, 20 Vimy Comercial were secretly converted into bombers under the order of the Zhili clique warlord Cao Kun, and later participated in the Second Zhili–Fengtian War.

During the war these bombers were initially highly successful due to the low-level bombing tactics used, with the air force chief-of-staff of the Zhili clique, General Zhao Buli (趙步壢) personally flying many of the missions. However, on 17 September, returning from a successful bombing mission outside Shanhai Pass, General Zhao&#x27;s aircraft was hit by ground fire from the Fengtian clique in the region of Nine Gates (Jiumenkou, 九門口) and had to make a forced landing. Zhao made a successful escape back to his base, but the bombers subsequently flew at much higher altitude to avoid ground fire, which greatly reduced their bombing accuracy and effectiveness.

After numerous battles between Chinese warlords, all of the aircraft fell into the hands of the Fengtian clique, forming its &quot;First Heavy Bomber Group&quot;. These were in the process of being phased out at the time of the Mukden Incident and therefore were subsequently captured by the Japanese, who soon disposed of them.

==Replicas==
A replica transatlantic Vimy cockpit section was built by Vickers for the London Science Museum in the early 1920s, and three full-size replicas have also been built. The first was a taxiable replica commissioned by British Lion Films from Shawcraft Models Ltd of Iver Heath, Bucks; the planned film about Alcock &amp; Brown&#x27;s transatlantic flight was never made, but the model was completed and paid for. Its fate remains a mystery although it appeared on static display at the Battle of Britain air display at RAF Biggin Hill in 1955 and may have been subsequently stored dismantled in East London until at least the late 1980s. The engine nacelles appear in the mine scene from the film &#x27;Daleks&#x27; Invasion Earth 2150 A.D.&#x27;, so it may not have been in good condition by then.

In 1969 an airworthy Vimy replica (registered G-AWAU) was built by the Vintage Aircraft Flying Association at Brooklands; this was first flown by D. G. &#x27;Dizzy&#x27; Addicott and Peter Hoar. It was badly damaged by fire and was displayed until February 2014 at the RAF Museum, Hendon, London). It is currently stored dismantled at the RAF Museum storage facility in Stafford.

A second flyable Vimy replica, NX71MY, was built in 1994 by an Australian-American team led by Lang Kidby and Peter McMillan, and this aircraft successfully recreated the three great pioneering Vimy flights: England to Australia flown by Lang Kidby and Peter McMillan (in 1994), England to South Africa flown by Mark Rebholz and John LaNoue (1999) and in 2005, Alcock and Brown&#x27;s 1919 Atlantic crossing was recreated by Steve Fossett and Mark Rebholz. The aircraft was donated to Brooklands Museum in 2006 and was kept airworthy in order to commemorate the 90th anniversaries of the Transatlantic and Australian flights, then retired in late 2009. Its final flight was made by John Dodd, Clive Edwards and Peter McMillan from Dunsfold to Brooklands on 15 November 2009 and four days later, in 18 hours, the aircraft was dismantled, transported the short distance to the museum and reassembled inside the main hangar by a dedicated volunteer team. Two days later a special Brooklands Vimy Exhibition was officially opened by Peter McMillan, and this unique aircraft is now on public display there.

<doc id="422838" wikidata="Q1191702" url="?curid=422838" title="Constructed writing system">
<text>A constructed writing system or a neography is a writing system specifically created by an individual or group, rather than having evolved as part of a language or culture like a natural script. Some are designed for use with constructed languages, although several of them are used in linguistic experimentation or for other more practical ends in existing languages. Prominent examples of constructed scripts include Korean Hangul and Tengwar.

==Constructed scripts and traditional &quot;natural&quot; writing systems==
All scripts, including traditional scripts ranging from Chinese to Arabic script, are human creations. However, scripts usually evolve out of other scripts rather than being designed by an individual. In most cases, alphabets are &quot;adopted&quot;, i.e. a language is written in another language&#x27;s script at first, and gradually develops peculiarities specific to its new environment over the centuries (such as the letters w and j added to the Latin alphabet over time, not being formally considered full members of the English (as opposed to Latin) alphabet until the mid-1800s). In the vast majority of cases, inventors of writing systems have been either literate themselves or familiar with the concept of writing (see History of writing). As such, constructed scripts tend to be informed by at least one older writing system, making it difficult in some cases to decide whether a new script is simply an adoption or a new creation (for example the Cyrillic and the Gothic alphabets, which are heavily influenced by the Greek alphabet but were nevertheless designed by individual authors).

In the rare cases where a script evolved not out of a previous script, but out of proto-writing (the only known cases being the Cuneiform script, Egyptian hieroglyphs, the Chinese script and the Mayan script, with ongoing debate as to whether the hitherto-undeciphered Indus script and Rongorongo are true writing or proto-writing), the process was nevertheless a gradual evolution of a system of symbols, not a creation by design.

==Overview of constructed writing systems==

===For previously unwritten languages===
Some scripts were invented for spoken languages that did not have adequate writing systems, including the Hangul, Cherokee, Canadian Aboriginal syllabics, N&#x27;Ko, Fraser, Goulsse alphabet, Tangut and Pollard scripts. Armenian, Georgian, and Glagolitic may fit in this category, though their origin is not known.

===For religious and mystical purposes===

Many scripts are created for religious or mystical purposes. Missionaries and religious scholars may be motivated to devise new scripts for previously-unwritten languages to facilitate the translation of religious writings, as was the case for several of the scripts mentioned in the previous section. Religious leaders may promulgate new writing systems among their followers for liturgical use and/or the promotion of cultural identity and unity, as with Sorang Sompeng, Medefaidrin and the script invented by the Zomi religious leader Pau Cin Hau, among many others.
Relatedly, some scripts are created for mystical or magical uses, such as communication with purported spiritual entities. Such is the case with John Dee and Edward Kelley&#x27;s Enochian language and alphabet, the various scripts (including Celestial, Malachim, Theban, and Transitus Fluvii) documented by Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa and his teacher Johannes Trithemius, and possibly the &quot;litterae ignotae&quot; devised by Hildegard of Bingen to write her Lingua Ignota.

Several of these scripts are described by their creators as having been revealed during or developed in response to visionary experiences.

===In fictional works===
The best-known constructed scripts dedicated to fictional languages are J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s elaborate Tengwar and Cirth, but many others exist, such as the pIqaD script for &quot;Star Trek&quot;&#x27;s Klingon language, and D&#x27;ni from the &quot;Myst&quot; series of video games.

Other works stop short of creating entire languages, and instead use constructed scripts as substitution ciphers or alternate orthographies for existing languages- English-language examples include the script of the Orokin language (referred to by members of the community as &quot;Tennobet&quot;, a portmanteau of &quot;Tenno&quot; and &quot;alphabet&quot;) from the video game &quot;Warframe&quot;, the unnamed New World script from &quot;Kirby and the Forgotten Land&quot;, Aurebesh from &quot;Star Wars&quot;, and the alien writing appearing in the television series &quot;Futurama&quot;.

===For technical purposes===
Several writing systems have been devised for technical purposes by specialists in various fields. One of the most prominent of these is the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), used by linguists to describe the sounds of human language in exhaustive detail. While based on the Latin alphabet, IPA also contains invented letters, Greek letters, and numerous diacritics. Other scripts, such as John Malone&#x27;s Unifon, Sir James Pitman&#x27;s Initial Teaching Alphabet, and Alexander Melville Bell&#x27;s Visible Speech were invented for pedagogical purposes. Yerkish, a communication system created for use by non-human primates, involves a system of lexigrams- visual symbols corresponding to various objects and ideas. Shorthand systems may be considered constructed scripts intended to facilitate speed and ease of writing.

===Language reform===
Some constructed scripts are intended to replace existing writing systems. In the mid-1800s, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints promoted the Deseret alphabet as an alternative writing system better suited to English phonology; roughly a century later, the estate of Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw commissioned the Shavian alphabet (later developed into Quikscript) to serve similar aims. Graphic Designer Bradbury Thompson&#x27;s Alphabet 26 represents a similar project. (see also: English-language spelling reform). Taking language reform further, various proposed philosophical or auxiliary languages- such as aUI, Solresol, and the language outlined in John Wilkins&#x27; 1668 &quot;An Essay Towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language&quot; have associated writing systems. Charles K. Bliss&#x27;s Blissymbols represent a proposed international auxiliary language whose primary mode is written rather than spoken.

===Other===
Several constructed scripts serve unique purposes not outlined above. Ong Kommandam&#x27;s Khom Script, in addition to serving a religious role, was used to conceal military communications during the Holy Man&#x27;s Rebellion. Around the turn of the 18th century, Frenchman George Psalmanazar invented a purported &#x27;Formosan&#x27; alphabet to further his fraudulent claims of being the first Taiwanese visitor to Europe; the Coelbren y Beirdd alphabet invented by Iolo Morganwg is another such example of linguistic forgery. Braille and most other tactile alphabets were invented to serve the needs of the visually impaired, or, in the case of Lewis Carroll&#x27;s Nyctography, of sighted people without access to light.

==Encoding==
Some neographies have been encoded in Unicode, in particular the Shavian alphabet and the Deseret alphabet. A proposal for Klingon pIqaD was turned down because most users of the Klingon language wrote it using the Latin alphabet, but both Tengwar and Cirth were under consideration in 2010. An unofficial project exists to coordinate the encoding of many constructed scripts in specific places in the Unicode Private Use Areas ( to U+F8FF and U+000F0000 to U+0010FFFF), known as the ConScript Unicode Registry.

Some of the scripts have identifying codes assigned among the ISO 15924 codes and IETF language tags.

<text>Sobieszewo Island (; ; formerly ) is an island on the Baltic Sea, between the Gdańsk Bay and the delta of Vistula river. The island is part of the territory of the city of Gdańsk, Poland.

==Location==
The northern border of the island is the waters of Gdańsk Bay, while its southern border is a branch of the Vistula river, called the Martwa Wisła. The western border was created in 1840 during the flooding and creation of a new mouth of the Vistula called Śmiała Wisła. The eastern border was dug in 1895 as a new, artificially created mouth of Vistula, called Przekop Wisły.

In Górki Wschodnie is located a bird reservation and a center for research on birds.

Sobieszewo Island is one of the 34 quarters of Gdańsk.

==Scouting and Guiding==
The island is the venue for the Polish Scouting and Guiding Association&#x27;s (ZHP) bid to host the 26th World Scout Jamboree in 2027. It was the venue of the European Jamboree 2020.

<doc id="422855" wikidata="Q1571749" url="?curid=422855" title="24/7 service">
<text>In commerce and industry, 24/7 or 24-7 service (usually pronounced &quot;twenty-four seven&quot;) is service that is available at any time and usually, every day. An alternate orthography for the numerical part includes 24×7 (usually pronounced &quot;twenty-four by seven&quot;). The numerals stand for &quot;24 hours a day, 7 days a week&quot;. Less commonly used, 24/7/52 (adding &quot;52 weeks&quot;) and 24/7/365 service (adding &quot;365 days&quot;) make it clear that service is available every day of the year.

Synonyms include around-the-clock service (with/without hyphens) and all day every day, especially in British English, and nonstop service, but the latter can also refer to other things, such as public transport services which go between two stations without stopping.

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (OED) defines the term as &quot;twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week; constantly&quot;. It lists its first reference to 24/7 to be from a 1983 story in the US magazine &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; in which Louisiana State University player Jerry Reynolds describes his jump shot in just such a way: 24-7-365.

==Examples==
===Commercial business===
24/7 service might be offered by a supermarket, convenience store, ATM, automated online assistant, filling station, restaurant, concierge services or a staffed datacenter, or a staffing company that specializes in providing nurses since often nurses cover shifts 24/7 at hospital which are open 24/7. 24/7 services may also include taxicabs, security services, and in densely populated urban areas, construction crews.

===Emergency services and transport===

Public 24/7 services often include those provided by emergency medical providers, police, fire and emergency telephone numbers, such as 9-1-1 in North America.

Transport services like airports, airlines, and ferry services, and in some cases trains and buses, may provide 24-hour service. Examples of public transport services operating 24/7 include the New York City Subway, Staten Island Railway, PATH, PATCO, the Copenhagen Metro, and the Red Line and Blue Line of the Chicago &quot;L&quot;.

===Industrial and utility services===
Industrial and manufacturing facilities—especially those that operate near or at capacity, or which depend upon processes (such as production lines) that are costly to suspend—often provide 24/7 services. Similarly, utilities generally must provide multiple 24/7 services. For instance, an electricity provider will handle outage reports 24/7 and dispatch emergency repair technicians 24/7, in addition to monitoring electrical infrastructure and producing electricity at all times. The same applies to telecommunications and internet service providers.

===Nonprofit and charity services===
Many crisis centers and crisis hotlines provide 24/7 services.

==Methods==
===Continuous operations===
Many 24/7 services operate continuously at all times with complete shift staff.

===Geographical alternation===
24/7 services that can utilize virtual offices, such as call centers, may employ daytime agents in alternating time zones.

==Service disruption==
In some cases, 24/7 services may be temporarily unavailable under certain circumstances. Such scenarios may include scheduled maintenance, upgrades or renovation, emergency repair, and injunction. 24/7 services which depend upon the physical presence of employees at a given location may also be interrupted when a minimum number of employees cannot be present due to scenarios such as extreme weather, death threats, natural disasters, or mandatory evacuation. 

Some 24/7 services close during major holidays.

===Redundancy and hardening===
24/7 services often employ complex schemes that ensure their resistance to potential disruption, resilience in the event of disruption, and minimum standards of overall reliability.

Critical infrastructure may be supported by failover systems, electric generators, and satellite communications. In the event of catastrophic disaster, some 24/7 services prepare entirely redundant, parallel infrastructures, often in other geographic regions.

===Long-term post-COVID disruption===
At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, many stores ended 24/7 operations, ostensibly on a temporary basis, in order to clean and sanitize their establishments. After the widespread availability of vaccines, however, many such businesses have not returned to 24-hour service for a variety of reasons. Some proprietors in the United States originally blamed pandemic unemployment benefits for a lack of workers, yet employers still struggled to resume pre-pandemic hours after these programs ended, citing continued staff shortages and demands for better working conditions among jobseekers. Many businesses that were once broadly open for 24/7 operations only resumed such service across some of their establishments or have ended 24/7 operations altogether, as in the case of Walmart.

==Criticism==

24/7 workplaces can put employees under conditions that limit their personal life choices and development. Calls for a rehumanisation of the 24/7 workplace have therefore been voiced. Some have also remarked on the &quot;collective mania&quot; especially in the US that takes a sort of pride in the &quot;work at all times&quot; attitude exemplified by the 24/7 concept.

In England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, the Sunday trading laws prevent many stores from truly opening 24/7, but they sometimes advertise as such. Some core services such as filling stations are exempt from the law requiring them to close. A campaign against changing the law was supported by many bodies, including the Church of England, the Church in Wales, and many secular bodies in an effort called Keep Sunday Special.

<doc id="422861" wikidata="Q142472" url="?curid=422861" title="Käthe Kollwitz">
<text>Käthe Kollwitz ( born as Schmidt; 8 July 186722 April 1945) was a German artist who worked with painting, printmaking (including etching, lithography and woodcuts) and sculpture. Her most famous art cycles, including &quot;The Weavers&quot; and &quot;The Peasant War&quot;, depict the effects of poverty, hunger and war on the working class. Despite the realism of her early works, her art is now more closely associated with Expressionism. Kollwitz was the first woman not only to be elected to the Prussian Academy of Arts but also to receive honorary professor status.

==Life and work==

===Youth===
Kollwitz was born in Königsberg, Prussia, as the fifth child in her family. Her father, Karl Schmidt, was a Social Democrat who became a mason and house builder. Her mother, Katherina Schmidt, was the daughter of Julius Rupp, a Lutheran pastor who was expelled from the official Evangelical State Church and founded an independent congregation. Her education and her art were greatly influenced by her grandfather&#x27;s lessons in religion and socialism. Her older brother Conrad became a prominent economist of the SPD.

Recognizing her talent, Kollwitz&#x27;s father arranged for her to begin lessons in drawing and copying plaster casts on 14 August 1879 when she was twelve. In 1885-6 she began her formal study of art under the direction of Karl Stauffer-Bern, a friend of the artist Max Klinger, at the School for Women Artists in Berlin. At sixteen she began working with subjects associated with the Realism movement, making drawings of working people, sailors and peasants she saw in her father&#x27;s offices. The etchings of Klinger, their technique and social concerns, were an inspiration to Kollwitz.

In 1888/89, she studied painting with Ludwig Herterich in Munich, where she realized her strength was not as a painter, but a draughtsman. When she was seventeen, her brother Konrad introduced her to Karl Kollwitz, a medical student. Thereafter, Kathe became engaged to Karl, while she was studying art in Munich. In 1890, she returned to Königsberg, rented her first studio, and continued to depict the harsh labors of the working class. These subjects were an inspiration in her work for years.

In 1891, Kollwitz married Karl, who by this time was a doctor tending to the poor in Berlin. The couple moved into the large apartment that would be Kollwitz&#x27;s home until it was destroyed in World War II. The proximity of her husband&#x27;s practice proved invaluable:

&quot;The motifs I was able to select from this milieu (the workers&#x27; lives) offered me, in a simple and forthright way, what I discovered to be beautiful... People from the bourgeois sphere were altogether without appeal or interest. All middle-class life seemed pedantic to me. On the other hand, I felt the proletariat had guts. It was not until much later...when I got to know the women who would come to my husband for help, and incidentally also to me, that I was powerfully moved by the fate of the proletariat and everything connected with its way of life... But what I would like to emphasize once more is that compassion and commiseration were at first of very little importance in attracting me to the representation of proletarian life; what mattered was simply that I found it beautiful.&quot;

===Personal health===
It is believed Kollwitz suffered anxiety during her childhood due to the death of her siblings, including the death of her younger brother, Benjamin. More recent research suggests that Kollwitz may have suffered from a childhood neurological disorder dysmetropsia (sometimes called &quot;Alice in Wonderland syndrome&quot;, due to its sensory hallucinations and migraines).

===&quot;The Weavers&quot;===
Between the births of her sons – Hans in 1892 and Peter in 1896 – Kollwitz saw a performance of Gerhart Hauptmann&#x27;s &quot;The Weavers&quot;, which dramatized the oppression of the Silesian weavers in Langenbielau and their failed revolt in 1844. Kollwitz was inspired by the performance and ceased work on a series of etchings she had intended to illustrate Émile Zola&#x27;s &quot;Germinal.&quot; She produced a cycle of six works on the weavers theme, three lithographs (&quot;Poverty&quot;, &quot;Death&quot;, and &quot;Conspiracy&quot;) and three etchings with aquatint and sandpaper (&quot;March of the Weavers&quot;, &quot;Riot&quot;, and &quot;The End&quot;). Not a literal illustration of the drama, nor an idealization of workers, the prints expressed the workers&#x27; misery, hope, courage, and eventually, doom.

The cycle was exhibited publicly in 1898 to wide acclaim. But when Adolph Menzel nominated her work for the gold medal of the Great Berlin Art Exhibition of 1898 in Berlin, Kaiser Wilhelm II withheld his approval, saying &quot;I beg you gentlemen, a medal for a woman, that would really be going too far . . . orders and medals of honour belong on the breasts of worthy men.&quot; Nevertheless, &quot;The Weavers&quot; became Kollwitz&#x27; most widely acclaimed work.

===&quot;Peasant War&quot;===
Kollwitz&#x27;s second major cycle of works was the &quot;Peasant War.&quot; The production of this series lasted from 1902 to 1908 due to many preliminary drawings and discarded ideas in lithography. It was inspired by the German Peasants&#x27; War of 1524–1525, when oppressed peasants in southern Germany took arms against the nobility and the Church. As with &quot;The Weavers&quot;, this body of work may have been influenced by a Hauptmann play, &quot;Florian Geyer&quot; (1895). However, the initial source of Kollwitz&#x27;s interest dated to her youth when she and her brother Konrad playfully imagined themselves as barricade fighters in a revolution. Not only did Kollwitz have a childhood connection, but an artistic connection as well. She was an advocate for those without a voice and liked to portray the working class in a way no one else saw. The artist identified with the character of Black Anna, a woman cited as a protagonist in the uprising. When completed, the &quot;Peasant War&quot; consisted of seven etchings: &quot;Plowing&quot;, &quot;Raped&quot;, &quot;Sharpening the Scythe&quot;, &quot;Arming in the Vault&quot;, &quot;Charge&quot;, &quot;The Prisoners&quot;, and &quot;After the Battle&quot;. &quot;After the Battle&quot; is described as eerily premonitory as it features a mother searching for her son&#x27;s body in the night. In all, the works were technically more impressive than those of &quot;The Weavers&quot;, owing to their greater size and dramatic command of light and shadow. They are Kollwitz&#x27;s highest achievements as an etcher.

Kollwitz visited Paris twice while working on &quot;Peasant War&quot; and took classes at the Académie Julian in 1904 to learn to sculpt. The etching &quot;Outbreak&quot; was awarded the Villa Romana Prize. This prize provided a year&#x27;s stay in 1907 in a studio in Florence. Although Kollwitz completed no work there, she later recalled the impact of early Renaissance art she experienced during her time in Florence. 
===Modernism and World War I===
After her return to Germany, Kollwitz continued to exhibit her work but was impressed by younger compatriots. Expressionists and (after the First World War) Bauhaus artists inspired Kollwitz to simplify her means of expression. Subsequent works such as &quot;Runover&quot;, 1910, and &quot;Self-Portrait&quot;, 1912, show this new direction. She also continued to work on sculpture.
Kollwitz lost her younger son, Peter, on the battlefield in World War I in October 1914. The loss of her child began a stage of prolonged depression in her life. By the end of 1914 she had made drawings for a monument to Peter and his fallen comrades. She destroyed the monument in 1919 and began again in 1925. The memorial, titled &quot;The Grieving Parents&quot;, was finally completed and placed in the Belgian cemetery of Roggevelde in 1932. Later, when Peter&#x27;s grave was moved to the nearby Vladslo German war cemetery, the statues were also moved.&quot;We [women] are endowed with the strength to make sacrifices which are more painful than giving our own blood. Consequently, we are able to see our own [men] fight and die when it is for the sake of freedom.&quot;In 1917, on her 50th birthday, the galleries of Paul Cassirer provided a retrospective exhibition of one hundred and fifty drawings by Kollwitz.

Kollwitz was a committed socialist and pacifist, who was eventually attracted to communism. She expressed her political and social sympathies in her woodcut print, &quot;memorial sheet for Karl Liebknecht&quot; and in her involvement with the &quot;Arbeitsrat für Kunst&quot;, a part of the Social Democratic government in the first few weeks after the war. As the war wound down and a nationalistic appeal was made for old men and children to join the fighting, Kollwitz implored in a published statement:

There has been enough of dying! Let not another man fall!
While working on the sheet for Karl Liebknecht, she found etching insufficient for expressing monumental ideas. After viewing woodcuts by Ernst Barlach at the Secession exhibitions, she completed the Liebknecht sheet in the new medium and made about 30 woodcuts by 1926.

In 1919 Kollwitz was appointed to the position of professor at the Prussian Academy of Arts, the first woman to hold that position. Membership entailed a regular income, a large studio, and a full professorship. In 1933, the Nazi government forced her to resign from this position.

In 1928 she was also named director of the Master Class for Graphic Arts at the Prussian Academy. However, this title would soon be stripped after the Nazi regime rose to power.

===&quot;War&quot; (&quot;Krieg&quot;)===
In the years after World War I, her reaction to the war found a continuous outlet. In 1922–23 she produced the cycle &quot;War&quot; in woodcut form, including the works &quot;The Sacrifice&quot;, &quot;The Volunteers&quot;, &quot;The Parents&quot;, &quot;The Widow I&quot;, &quot;The Widow II&quot;, &quot;The Mothers&quot;, and &quot;The People&quot;. Much of this art was inspired by pro-war propaganda which she and Otto Dix riffed on to create anti-war propaganda. Kollwitz wanted to show the horrors of living through a war to combat the pro-war sentiment that had begun to grow in Germany again. In 1924 she finished her three most famous posters: &quot;Germany&#x27;s Children Starving&quot;, &quot;Bread&quot;, and &quot;Never Again War (&quot;Nie Wieder Krieg&quot;)&quot;.

===&quot;Death&quot; Cycle ===
Working now in a smaller studio, in the mid-1930s she completed her last major cycle of lithographs, &quot;Death&quot;, which consisted of eight stones: &quot;Woman Welcoming Death&quot;, &quot;Death with Girl in Lap&quot;, &quot;Death Reaches for a Group of Children&quot;, &quot;Death Struggles with a Woman&quot;, &quot;Death on the Highway&quot;, &quot;Death as a Friend&quot;, &quot;Death in the Water&quot;, and &quot;The Call of Death.&quot;

=== &quot;Seed Corn Must Not Be Ground&quot; (1942) ===
When Richard Dehmel called for more soldiers to fight in World War I in 1918, Kollwitz wrote an impassioned letter to the newspaper he published his call in, stating that there should be no more war, and that &quot;seed corn must not be ground&quot; in reference to young soldiers who were dying in the war. In 1942, she made a piece by the same name, this time in reaction to World War II. The work shows a mother, arms cast over three young children to protect them. 

===Later life and World War II===
In 1933, after the establishment of the National-Socialist regime, the Nazi Party authorities forced her to resign her place on the faculty of the &quot;Akademie der Künste&quot; following her support of the &quot;Dringender Appell&quot;. Her work was removed from museums. Although she was banned from exhibiting, one of her &quot;mother and child&quot; pieces was used by the Nazis for propaganda.
&quot;They give themselves with jubilation; they give themselves like a bright, pure flame ascending straight to heaven.&quot;

In July 1936, she and her husband were visited by the Gestapo, who threatened her with arrest and deportation to a Nazi concentration camp; they resolved to commit suicide if such a prospect became inevitable. However, Kollwitz was by now a figure of international note, and no further action was taken.

On her 70th birthday, she &quot;received over 150 telegrams from leading personalities of the art world,&quot; as well as offers to house her in the United States, which she declined for fear of provoking reprisals against her family.

She outlived her husband (who died from an illness in 1940) and her grandson Peter, who died in action in World War II two years later.

She was evacuated from Berlin in 1943. Later that year, her house was bombed and many drawings, prints, and documents were lost. She moved first to Nordhausen, then to Moritzburg, a town near Dresden, where she lived her final months as a guest of Prince Ernst Heinrich of Saxony. Kollwitz died just 16 days before the end of the war. She was cremated and honoured with an Ehrengrab in Berlin&#x27;s Friedrichsfelde Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Kollwitz made a total of 275 prints, in etching, woodcut and lithography. Virtually the only portraits she made during her life were images of herself, of which there are at least fifty. These self-portraits constitute a lifelong honest self-appraisal; &quot;they are psychological milestones&quot;.

Her silent lines penetrate the marrow like a cry of pain; such a cry was never heard among the Greeks and Romans.

Dore Hoyer and what had been Mary Wigman&#x27;s dance school created &quot;Dances for Käthe Kollwitz&quot;. The dance was performed in Dresden in 1946.
Käthe Kollwitz is a subject within William T. Vollmann&#x27;s &quot;Europe Central&quot;, a 2005 National Book Award winner for fiction. In the book, Vollmann describes the lives of those touched by the fighting and events surrounding World War II in Germany and the Soviet Union. Her chapter is entitled &quot;Woman with Dead Child&quot;, after her sculpture of the same name.

An enlarged version of a similar Kollwitz sculpture, &quot;Mother with her Dead Son&quot;, was placed in 1993 at the center of Neue Wache in Berlin, which serves as a monument to &quot;the Victims of War and Tyranny&quot;.

More than 40 German schools are named after Kollwitz. A statue of Kollwitz by Gustav Seitz was installed in Kollwitzplatz, Berlin in 1960 where it remains to this day.

Four museums, in Berlin, Cologne and Moritzburg, and the Käthe Kollwitz Museum in Koekelare are dedicated solely to her work. The Käthe Kollwitz Prize, established in 1960, is named after her.

In 1986, a DEFA film &quot;Käthe Kollwitz&quot;, about the artist was made with Jutta Wachowiak as Kollwitz.

In 2012, an exhibition of her work was curated for the Weisman Art Museum at the University of Minnesota by the art historian Corinna Kirsch.

Kollwitz is one of the 14 main characters of the series &quot;14 - Diaries of the Great War&quot; in 2014. She is played by actress Christina Große.

In 2017, Google Doodle marked Kollwitz&#x27;s 150th birthday.

An exhibition, &quot;Portrait of the Artist: Käthe Kollwitz&quot; was held at the Ikon Gallery in Birmingham, England, from 13 September26 November 2017, and is intended to be shown subsequently in Salisbury, Swansea, Hull and London.

A retrospective exhibition of her work was held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2024.

<text>Arby&#x27;s is an American fast food sandwich restaurant chain with more than 3,300 restaurants. The flagship property of Inspire Brands, it ranked third in systemwide sales in the United States in the quick-service and fast-casual restaurant industries in 2012, behind Subway and Panera Bread. In October 2017, &quot;Food &amp; Wine&quot; called Arby&#x27;s &quot;America&#x27;s second largest sandwich chain (after Subway)&quot;.

Roark Capital Group acquired 81.5% of Arby&#x27;s Restaurant Group in July 2011 and is now a majority-owner of Inspire Brands. The Wendy&#x27;s Company held a minority stake of 18.5% in Arby&#x27;s after the acquisition by Roark Capital; that share was reduced to 12.3% upon the purchase of Buffalo Wild Wings, and was sold back to Inspire Brands on August 16, 2018, for $450 million, a 38 percent premium.

Arby&#x27;s is best known for selling roast beef sandwiches. Other menu items the chain is known for include gyros, wraps, chicken sandwiches, and milkshakes. Its headquarters are in Sandy Springs, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta that uses Atlanta mailing addresses.
In 2019, there were 3,472 restaurants. There are locations in seven countries outside the United States: Canada, Costa Rica, Egypt, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and Turkey.

==History==
Arby&#x27;s was founded in Boardman Township, Ohio, on July 23, 1964, by brothers Forrest (1922–2008) and Leroy Raffel (1927–2023), owners of a restaurant equipment business who thought there was a market opportunity for a fast food franchise based on a dish other than hamburgers. They wanted to call their restaurants &quot;Big Tex&quot;, but that name was already used by an Akron business. Instead, they chose the name &quot;Arby&#x27;s,&quot; a phonetic pronunciation of the letters R and B, short for &quot;Raffel brothers&quot;. Arby&#x27;s filed for reorganization with the United States bankruptcy court in February 1971, owing to a large number of debts accrued in expansion, as well as a nation-wide recession and relatively high price point compared to other fast-food chains of the time.

The Raffel brothers opened the first new restaurant in Boardman, Ohio, on July 23, 1964. They initially served only roast beef sandwiches, potato chips, and soft drinks. Hoping to attract a more upscale clientele, Arby&#x27;s interior design was purposely more luxurious in appearance than the typical fast food sandwich stand of the day. Arby&#x27;s offered their roast beef sandwiches for 69 cents at a time when hamburger stands were charging 15 cents for a hamburger. A year later, the first Arby&#x27;s licensee opened a restaurant in Akron, Ohio. Early Arby&#x27;s locations featured neon signage designed to resemble a cowboy hat, often bearing the text &quot;Arby&#x27;s roast beef sandwich is delicious&quot;. This sign was designed by the Peskin Sign Co.

During the 1970s, the expansion of Arby&#x27;s took place at a rate of 50 stores per year. During this time it created several menu items, including the Beef &#x27;n Cheddar, Jamocha Shakes, chicken sandwiches, curly fries, and two signature sauces: Arby&#x27;s Sauce and Horsey Sauce. Baked potatoes were added to the menu in 1985. Curly fries were initially introduced as Curly-Q Fries in 1988. It became the first restaurant in the fast food industry to offer a complete &quot;lite&quot; menu in 1991 with several sandwiches and salads under 300 calories and 94 percent fat-free.

The family-owned business tried converting into a public company in 1970 by offering the sale of stock, but the IPO never went through when the stock market subsequently fell. In 1976, the family sold the company to Royal Crown Cola Company for $18 million and Leroy Raffel remained as CEO until his retirement three years later.

In 1984, Victor Posner obtained Arby&#x27;s via a hostile takeover of its then parent Royal Crown through his DWG Corporation. Nine years later, with a new owner of DWG Corporation and a new name, Triarc Companies, Inc., a former PepsiCo executive, Don Pierce, was brought in to &quot;resurrect&quot; Arby&#x27;s. With $100 million additional funding, Pierce moved to a new &quot;Roast Town&quot; concept, similar in format to Boston Market, in 1996. The Roast Town concept received poor marks in market tests and was quickly discontinued. Pierce and his team left the company and it sold all of its 354 company-owned locations to RTM Restaurant Group, an existing Arby&#x27;s franchise, for $71 million. Another marketing concept that was tried was a dual-brand venture that was started in 1995 with ZuZu&#x27;s Handmade Mexican Grill. The marketing venture was a failure resulting in lawsuits being filed by each company against the other.

In 1992, Les Franchises P.R.A.G. Inc. opened the first Arby&#x27;s franchise in the Canadian province of Quebec. It was also the 100th location to open in Canada and joins other locations that were then operating in the provinces of Ontario, Alberta, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Manitoba, British Columbia, and Saskatchewan. The Quebec location also sold the uniquely French-Canadian dish called poutine.

In 2002, Arby&#x27;s returned to operating restaurants by purchasing the second largest Arby&#x27;s franchisee, Sybra Inc., with 293 locations out of bankruptcy outbidding RTM so as to prevent RTM from becoming too large. RTM was purchased by Arby&#x27;s on July 25, 2005.

In November 2002, Access Now filed a lawsuit against RTM, then a franchise of Triarc, that some 800 of their stores did not comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). The lawsuit had no liability damages except for lawyer fees. In August 2006, the court accepted the settlement between RTM and Access Now. The result was that every year, 100 of the RTM stores would be retrofitted to comply with the ADA. Accordingly, it was estimated that about $1.2 million would be spent to retrofit those stores each year.

In 2008, Triarc purchased Wendy&#x27;s, and changed its name to Wendy&#x27;s/Arby&#x27;s Group, to reflect their core businesses. In January 2011, it was announced that Wendy&#x27;s/Arby&#x27;s Group were looking into selling the Arby&#x27;s side of the business to focus on the Wendy&#x27;s brand. It was officially announced the companies would split on January 21, 2011. In 2009, the Wendy&#x27;s/Arby&#x27;s Group signed a franchise deal with the Al Jammaz Group of Saudi Arabia to open dual-branded Wendy&#x27;s/Arby&#x27;s through the Middle East with the first location opening in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates in May 2010. The Wendy&#x27;s/Arby&#x27;s Group also signed a similar franchise deal in June 2010 with Tab Gida Sanayi ve Ticaret to open dual-branded restaurants in Turkey. After the split, the former Wendy&#x27;s/Arby&#x27;s Group became The Wendy&#x27;s Company.

In 2010, Arby&#x27;s opened a restaurant at Ft. Bliss, their first location at an American military base under a deal that the Wendy&#x27;s/Arby&#x27;s Group had signed with the Army and Air Force Exchange Service to open restaurants at bases both in the United States and overseas. Only American military personnel and some of their guests can patronize the Arby&#x27;s locations situated on the military bases and operated by the Post Exchange.

There were two different attempts to operate franchises in the United Kingdom. GSR Restaurant Group opened their first Arby&#x27;s franchise location in London in 1992 followed by a second location the following year in Glasgow. These were also the first locations to open in Europe, but both were forced to close by 1994. In 2001, Barown Restaurants opened two Arby&#x27;s franchise locations in Southampton, Hampshire, and Sutton, London, but both were forced to close after operating for a few months.

On June 13, 2011, Wendy&#x27;s/Arby&#x27;s Group Inc. announced that it would sell the majority of its Arby&#x27;s chain to Roark Capital Group while maintaining an 18.5% stake in the company. At the time of the sale, Arby&#x27;s was experiencing an operating loss for the year of $35 million with 350 Arby&#x27;s franchisees more than 60 days late in royalty payments and 74 low performing franchised units and 96 company-owned units forced to close. Despite its cash flow problem, Arby&#x27;s also reported that it had six months of sales growth at established stores in the United States which it had attributed to its new turnaround plan that it had recently launched. The new owners turned the company around by closing more underperforming locations, changing the company&#x27;s marketing strategy, and by introducing new products on a regular basis. After four years, Arby&#x27;s was able to issue $300 million in dividends, which resulted in Wendy&#x27;s receiving $54.9 million for its minority stake with the remainder paid to Roark.

In February 2017, Arby&#x27;s reported that they were investigating a malware attack on their payment card system that had targeted thousands of customers&#x27; credit and debit cards. The malware was placed on point-of-sale systems inside Arby&#x27;s corporate-owned restaurants, not its locations owned by franchisees, and was active between October 25, 2016, and January 19, 2017. Eight credit unions and banks from Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Montana have filed suit since early February against Arby&#x27;s concerning the data breach.

In September 2017, Arby&#x27;s returned to Kuwait for the first time in two decades by the opening of an Arby&#x27;s franchise in Jabriya by Kharafi Global.

In November 2017, Arby&#x27;s announced it had negotiated a purchase for the restaurant chain Buffalo Wild Wings for $2.4 billion in cash. As part of this acquisition, the parent was renamed from Arby&#x27;s Restaurant Group, Inc. to Inspire Brands.

In October 2018, Arby&#x27;s expanded into the North African country of Egypt by opening three restaurants in the capital city of Cairo with the help of local franchise partner Vantage Egypt Tourism and Entertainment.

In January 2022, Arby&#x27;s announced launching in Saudi Arabia in an exclusive development agreement with Shahia Foods Limited Company, with the first restaurants expected to open in the capital city of Riyadh in late 2022. This agreement marks the brand&#x27;s first-ever entry into Saudi Arabia and largest expansion into the Middle East to-date.

==Products==
In addition to roast beef, deli style sandwiches, called &quot;Market Fresh Sandwiches,&quot; are sold at Arby&#x27;s. The original lineup of sandwiches included Roast Beef and Swiss, Roast Turkey and Swiss, Roast Ham and Swiss, and Roast Chicken Caesar. With the exception of the Chicken Caesar, all Market Fresh Sandwiches came with the standard toppings of spicy brown honey mustard, mayonnaise, red onion rings, green leaf lettuce, tomato slices and sliced Swiss cheese. Additions to the Market Fresh lineup included Roast Turkey Ranch and Bacon and the Ultimate BLT. Market Fresh Five-Star Club, served on Harvest White Bread, was introduced in 2003 for a limited time.

The Ultimate BLT was released for a limited time in 2002 and later in 2012.

In 2003, the line was again expanded to include other styles of specialty sandwiches that were served on baguettes that included the Italian Beef &#x27;n Provolone, French Dip &#x27;n Swiss, Philly Beef Supreme, and Pot Roast sandwiches.

Corned beef and turkey Reuben sandwiches were added to the menu in 2005.

In early 2006, Arby&#x27;s Restaurant Group signed a contract with Pepsi, making Pepsi the chain&#x27;s exclusive soft drink provider. Franchises which had contracts with Coca-Cola switched to Pepsi-Cola when their contracts with Coca-Cola expired. 

It was announced in August 2017, that Coca-Cola had won a contract to serve Coke products at all its restaurants, ending an almost 11-year association with Pepsi. The transition began in early 2018, and all Arby&#x27;s locations were serving Coca-Cola beverages by June 19, 2018. Arby&#x27;s promoted their announcement by breaking two Guinness World Records. The first record, &quot;world&#x27;s smallest advertisement&quot;, measured 38.3 microns by 19.2 microns on a sesame seed and was printed at Georgia Tech. The second record, &quot;largest advertising poster&quot;, took up approximately 5 acres of land and was placed in Monowi, Nebraska, America&#x27;s smallest town.

Toasted Subs, sandwiches served on a toasted ciabatta roll, were first introduced in September 2007. The initial line-up included the French Dip &amp; Swiss Toasted Sub, Philly Beef Toasted Sub, Classic Italian Toasted Sub, and Turkey Bacon Club. Three months later, the Toasted Subs product line was extended to include the Meatball Toasted Sub and the Chicken Parmesan Toasted Sub.

In October 2013, Arby&#x27;s introduced a Smokehouse Brisket sandwich.

In September 2014, Arby&#x27;s introduced gyros to its menu for a limited time. Gyros were previously offered in 2006. They have since become a permanent menu fixture on the menu in April 2016.

On an almost annual basis, Arby&#x27;s had offered some sort of a flatbread melt sandwich for a limited time. In 2007 and again in 2008, it was the Philly Cheesesteak and the Fajita Beef. The Beef Fajita returned with the new Chicken Fajita in 2009. After a six-year hiatus, Steak Fajita Flatbreads were offered for a limited time in 2015. The following year, Steak Fajita returned in 2016 with Chicken Fajita along with a choice between a hot and mild sauce.

After a nine-year hiatus, a pork-beef mixture meatball sandwich was reintroduced in July 2016.

In August 2015, Arby&#x27;s introduced a series of five small sandwiches called Sliders starting at $1.29, with prices varied by location. These new menu items led to an increase in sales at many locations. This is not the first time Arby&#x27;s tried to market miniature sandwiches. Two years earlier, Arby&#x27;s tried to sell a similar product called the Mighty Minis that were sold in pairs. During the first month of national sales, the firm was able to sell 1 million or a ton of sliders. To encourage additional sales outside normal lunch and dinner meal hours, began to offer sliders and small size drinks and sides at the reduced price of $1 between the hours of 2 and 5 p.m. starting in October 2015. Due to Arby&#x27;s great success in the increase of sales created by the introduction of this new product line, Nation&#x27;s Restaurant News awarded Arby&#x27;s its MenuMasters Award for 2016. The Turkey &#x27;n Cheese was initially offered as a limited time menu item in December 2016 but was shown to be popular enough to be retained on the regular menu. A Pizza Slider was introduced as a limited time menu item in May 2017.

In late August 2016, Arby&#x27;s introduced four chicken sandwiches that used a buttermilk-based breaded breast filet.

Arby&#x27;s debuted a new sandwich known as Smokehouse Pork Belly Sandwich in October 2016.

In October 2016, word leaked through social media that Arby&#x27;s was about to test a venison sandwich, which Arby&#x27;s confirmed, selecting 17 stores in Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Wisconsin (all major deer hunting states) to offer it during a four-day test during those states&#x27; respective hunting seasons. Prior to the start of the promotion, &quot;USA Today&quot; published the locations of all 17 participating restaurants. Both due to curiosity and heavy demand from hunters, the sandwiches sold out in all markets on the first day of the test. Another &quot;USA Today&quot; article reported that the farm-raised venison was imported from New Zealand. In the following year, Arby&#x27;s announced that the venison sandwich would return nationwide on October 21, 2017, also available in limited quantities.

In September 2017, Arby&#x27;s introduced the Chicken Pepperoni Parm sandwich, their version of a chicken parmigiana sandwich which also contains pepperoni slices.

In October 2017, Arby&#x27;s announced that three locations in Colorado, Montana, and Wyoming will offer an elk sandwich for a limited time. The farm-raised elk meat that was used to make the sandwiches was obtained from the same farm in New Zealand that provides the venison to Arby&#x27;s since many states, such as Montana, prohibit the raising of game animals on commercial farms.

The following October, Arby&#x27;s once again offered a featured wild game sandwich in 16 of its restaurants. This time, it would be a duck breast sandwich topped with a cherry sauce and crispy onions.

Some locations also serve breakfast, including at truck stop locations operated by Pilot Flying J and Love&#x27;s Travel Stops and Country Stores that are typically operating 24 hours.

==Advertising==
Since 2014, Ving Rhames has been the narrator of Arby&#x27;s commercials. The chain&#x27;s current slogan is &quot;Arby&#x27;s, We Have The Meats!&quot;

==Global locations==

Arby&#x27;s currently has locations in Canada, Costa Rica, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Mexico, South Korea, Turkey, and the United States (in every state except Rhode Island and Vermont). There are also Arby&#x27;s locations for service members in the Kadena Air Base and Camp Foster in Okinawa, Japan.

<doc id="422885" wikidata="Q199895" url="?curid=422885" title="Katorga">
<text>Katorga (, ; from medieval and modern ; and Ottoman Turkish: , ) was a system of penal labor in the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union (see Katorga labor in the Soviet Union). 

Prisoners were sent to remote penal colonies in vast uninhabited areas of Siberia and the Russian Far East where voluntary settlers and workers were never available in sufficient numbers. The prisoners had to perform forced labor under harsh conditions.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;katorga&quot; (Russian: ) originated from the Ottoman Turkish word &quot;kadırga,&quot; which means &quot;galley&quot; (a type of ship). This transition reflects the historical practice where, among others, Ukrainian and Russian slaves, were subjected to severe penal labor on galleys or in similar harsh conditions. In the Crimean Khanate and the Ottoman Empire, the practice of forcing slaves to work on galleys was common, and the suffering endured by these individuals was often depicted in Ukrainian dumas (songs).

In the Russian language, &quot;katorga&quot; evolved to denote a form of penal labor or a harsh prison system, transcending its initial maritime connotation. This semantic shift underscores the extreme nature of the punishment associated with &quot;katorga,&quot; which became synonymous with &quot;prison&quot; in Russian parlance, reflecting the severe conditions faced by those condemned to such labor.

==History==
&quot;Katorga&quot;, a category of punishment within the judicial system of the Russian Empire, had many of the features associated with labor-camp imprisonment: confinement, simplified facilities (as opposed to prisons), and forced labor, usually involving hard, unskilled or semi-skilled work.

Katorga camps were established in the 17th century by Tsar Alexis of Russia in newly conquered, underpopulated areas of Siberia and the Russian Far East—regions that had few towns or food sources. Despite the isolated conditions, a few prisoners successfully escaped to populated areas. From these times, Siberia gained its fearful connotation of punishment, which was further enhanced by the Soviet gulag system.

After the change in Russian penal law in 1847, exile and katorga became common punishments for participants in national uprisings within the Russian Empire. This led to increasing numbers of Poles sent to Siberia for katorga. These people have become known in Poland as &quot;Sybiraks&quot; (&quot;Siberians&quot;). Some of them remained there, forming a Polish minority in Siberia.

The most common occupations in katorga camps were mining and timber work. Another example involved the successful construction of the Amur Cart Road ().

In 1891 Anton Chekhov, the Russian writer and playwright, visited the katorga settlements on Sakhalin island in the Russian Far East and wrote about the conditions there in his book &quot;Sakhalin Island&quot;. He criticized the short-sightedness and incompetence of the officials in charge that led to poor living standards, waste of government funds, and decreased productivity.

Peter Kropotkin, while &quot;aide de camp&quot; to the governor of Transbaikalia in the 1860s, was appointed to inspect the state of the prison system in the area; he later described his findings in his book &quot;In Russian and French Prisons&quot; (1887).

==Soviet times==
After the Russian Revolution of 1917 the Russian penal system was taken over by the Bolsheviks, who eventually transformed the katorga into the Gulag labor camps.

In 1943 the &quot;katorga labor&quot; () as a special, severe type of punishment was reintroduced. It was initially intended for Nazi collaborators, but other categories of political prisoners (for example, members of deported peoples who fled from exile) were also sentenced to &quot;katorga labor&quot;. Prisoners sentenced to &quot;katorga labor&quot; were sent to gulag prison camps with the most harsh regime, and many of them died.

<text>Volos (; ) is a coastal port city in Thessaly situated midway on the Greek mainland, about north of Athens and south of Thessaloniki. It is the capital of the Magnesia regional unit of the Thessaly Region. Volos is also the only outlet to the sea from Thessaly, the country&#x27;s largest agricultural region. With a population of 85,803 (2021), the city is an important industrial centre, and its port provides a bridge between Europe and Asia.

Volos is the newest of the Greek port cities, with a large proportion of modern buildings erected following catastrophic earthquakes in 1955. It includes the municipal units of Volos, Nea Ionia and Iolkos, as well as smaller suburban communities. The economy of the city is based on manufacturing, trade, services and tourism. Home to the University of Thessaly, the city also offers facilities for conferences, exhibitions and major sporting, cultural and scientific events. Volos participated in the 2004 Olympic Games, and the city has since played host to other athletic events, such as the European Athletic Championships. Volos hosted the 7th International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics from 27 July to 5 August 2013.

== Location ==
Built at the innermost point of the Pagasetic Gulf and at the foot of Mount Pilio (Pelion, the land of the Centaurs). The city spreads in the plain on the foothills of Mount Pelion, bordering the town of Agria to the east and Nea Anchialos to the southwest. Volos&#x27; municipality includes both towns, along with many nearby villages, including Makrinitsa and Portaria.

Volos is a major commercial port of mainland Greece in the Aegean sea (after Piraeus and Thessaloniki), with connection by ferry and hydrofoil to the nearby Sporades Islands, which include Skiathos, Skopelos and Alonissos. There are also connections to Lemnos, Lesbos, Chios and Skyros.

==History==

===Antiquity===

Modern Volos is built on the area of the ancient cities of Demetrias, Pagasae and Iolcos. Demetrias was established in 293 BC by Demetrius Poliorcetes, King of Macedon. Iolcus, or Iolkos, was known in mythology as the homeland of the hero Jason, who boarded the ship Argo accompanied by the Argonauts and sailed in quest of the Golden Fleece to Colchis. To the west of Volos lie the Neolithic settlements of Dimini, with a ruined acropolis, walls, and two beehive tombs dating to between 4000 and 1200 BC, and Sesklo, with the remains of the oldest acropolis in Greece (6000 BC). The mound of Kastro/Palaia in western Volos is the site of a Bronze Age settlement, including a Mycenaean palace complex where a couple of preserved Linear B tablets have been found.

===Byzantine era===

Iolcus is still attested in the early Byzantine period but was eclipsed for most of the Middle Ages by Demetrias. The Slavic tribe of the Belegezites settled in the area during the 7th century.

Volos first appears again in 1333, as one of the cities captured by the Byzantine general John Monomachos in Thessaly, under the name &quot;Golos&quot; (Γόλος). The name is of Slavic origin, from &quot;golo&quot;, &quot;golъ&quot;, &quot;barren&quot;. Another theory derives the name from Slavic &quot;golosh&quot;, &quot;seat of administration&quot;. Two alternative theories allude to a Greek origin through the words βολή (throw), as fishermen threw their nets into the sea from that area, and βώλος (piece of land) but the Greek scholar G. Hatzidakis considers them to be paretymologies at best. The modern form of the name is first attested in 1540.

The walls of medieval Golos follow the traces of the fortifications of ancient Iolcus, and many remnants of the ancient city have been found in the medieval citadel.

Along with the rest of Thessaly, Volos fell under Serbian rule in 1348, governed by Gregory Preljub. After Preljub&#x27;s death Thessaly passed under the brief rule of Nikephoros II Orsini, followed by the Serbian rulers Simeon Uroš and John Uroš. After the latter&#x27;s death in 1373, Thessaly returned under Byzantine rule for twenty years, until its conquest by the Ottoman Empire under Sultan Bayezid I.

===Ottoman era===
Ottoman rule was not yet firm. The first period of Ottoman control lasted from 1393 to 1397, followed by another , but it was not until 1423 that Volos was definitively incorporated into the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman name of the city was . The Ottomans strengthened the town&#x27;s fortifications against a possible Venetian attack, and installed not only a garrison, but also Muslim settlers from Anatolia. The local Christian population in turn moved to the slopes of Pelion. From this time on, Volos became the chief settlement on the Pagasetic Gulf.

The city began to spread outside its walls in the late 16th/early 17th centuries, coinciding with a growth in commerce, helped by the city&#x27;s famed twice-weekly local fair and the first works at the waterfront harbour. The fortress was captured by the Venetians under Francesco Morosini in 1665, during the Cretan War, but recovered and refortified by the Ottomans.

In May 1821, at the beginning of the Greek Revolution, the Greek rebels of Mount Pelion tried to capture the fortress but failed. On 8 April 1827, the Greek fleet, under the command of the British philhellene Frank Abney Hastings, captured five Ottoman ships in the city&#x27;s harbour and forced the local garrison to evacuate the fortress. The provisional government of Greece claimed Volos as part of Greek national territory, but the Treaty of Constantinople (1832), which established a Greek independent state, set its northern boundary along a line running south from Arta to Volos. Volos was incorporated into the Greek Kingdom in November 1881 with the rest of Thessaly.

===Modern Volos===
After its incorporation into the Greek Kingdom, the town had a population of only 4,900, but grew rapidly in the next four decades as merchants, businessmen, craftsmen and sailors gravitated toward it from the surrounding area. In the 1920s a large influx of refugees to the settlement took place, especially from Ionia, but also from Pontus, Cappadocia and Eastern Thrace. In 1882, Andreas Syngros established the Privileged Bank of Epirothessaly, which the National Bank of Greece acquired in 1899 after its founder&#x27;s death. Volos was occupied by Ottomans on 8 May 1897, during the Greco Turkish War.

The city had a vibrant Jewish community in the early 20th century: from ≈500 in 1896, it rose to ≈2,000 in 1930, before falling drastically to 882 members in 1940, because of emigration to the great cities of Thessaloniki and Athens or abroad. During the Axis occupation of Greece, the prompt actions of the local chief rabbi, Moshe Pessach, and the Greek authorities saved about 700 of the local Jewish community from deportation to the Nazi death camps.

After an aerial attack by Italian troops in November 1940 and another by the Germans in 1941, many of the city&#x27;s inhabitants took refuge in the villages of Pelion. Abandoning Volos after Italy&#x27;s capitulation in September 1943, the Italians left storerooms full of food, arms and ammunition. Large quantities of this material was transported with the Pelion railway to the mountain village Milies and under the supervision of ELAS loaded onto mules and taken to secure hideaways. When the Germans set off a column to Milies an officer and a soldier were killed by resistance fighters. In reprisal nearly the whole village was burnt down by German occupation troops on 4 October 1943. According to the official report of the municipality the Germans executed 25 men, and three inhabitants died in their houses from the flames.

Volos is also well known for its assortment of mezedes and a clear alcoholic beverage known as &quot;tsipouro&quot;.

A street in a sister city, Rostov-on-Don, bears the name &quot;Улица Греческого Города Волос&quot; (Street of the Greek City of Volos), weaving through a mix of early 20th-century buildings with characteristic inner yards, tiered balconies and open iron stairs that lend the old Rostov its characteristic Mediterranean look.

In September 2023 the city of Volos was flooded by massive rain.

==Administration==
The municipality Volos was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following nine former municipalities, that became municipal units:
* Agria
* Aisonia
* Artemida
* Iolcos
* Makrinitsa
* Nea Anchialos
* Nea Ionia
* Portaria
* Volos

The municipality has an area of 385.614 km2, the municipal unit 108.6 km2.

===Province===
The province of Volos () was one of the provinces of the Magnesia Prefecture. Its territory corresponded with that of the current municipalities Volos, Rigas Feraios, South Pelion and Zagora-Mouresi. It was abolished in 2006.

==Geography==


Volos is the administrative centre of the Magnesia regional unit. Many of the city domains are separated through natural barricades, such as rivers.

Three main rivers/mountain torrents all rise from mount Pelion (with its peak at ), crossing the city to create a unique urban geography, before ending in the Pagasetic Gulf flowing west. The Anavros river, famous for Jason&#x27;s pass, divides the Nea Demetriada district from the rest of the urban area. Krafsidonas is the major river passing through the city and constitutes the natural lung of the urbanized area of Volos, as well as the boundary between the major municipalities of the metropolitan city, the municipalities of Volos and Nea Ionia. Xirias (Ξηριάς), is the largest torrent in the metropolitan urban area of Volos and passes through the Nea Ionia municipal area.

===Climate===

Volos experiences a &quot;Csa&quot; hot-summer Mediterranean climate, with neither particularly high nor extremely low temperatures throughout the year. Its climate is one of fairly low humidity, favorable for all kinds of activities. Measurable rainfall occurs on average around 89 days per year. Thunderstorms occur sparsely throughout the year, more often during the warmer months. Snow occurs more or less every year on a few occasions, though it usually doesn&#x27;t cause disruption to daily life. The Pelion mountain, with its own microclimate, affects the city&#x27;s weather, acting as a rain shadow to the north-easterly winds thus limiting the amount of precipitation the city receives in comparison to the eastern side of the mountain. Average temperature values, like in most regions, have slightly increased in more recent periods.
==Architecture==
Two of the most known churches of Volos, St Nicholas and St Constantine and Helen on the promenade, were designed by architect Aristotelis Zachos. Volos was once also characterised by a number of old mansions, the majority of which were destroyed after the earthquakes in 1955. Nowadays, only some of them have been saved, restored and have a new, mainly public, use.

The development of the new city coincided with the flourishing of neoclassicism. Public buildings conformed to this style and private buildings belonging to prosperous merchants were particularly sophisticated. Typical examples include:
* The 3-story Hotel de France, with its impressive decorative murals (1894, Iasonos and K. Kartali Street)
* Old Tobacco Factory of Matsaggos (1890)
* Yellow Tobacco Warehouse (1926)
* The National Bank, formerly the Privileged Bank of Epirothessaly (1895)
* The Bank of Athens (1903, today the library of University of Thessaly)
* The Achillopouleion Hospital (1901)
* The Archaeological Museum of Volos, Athanasakeio (1909)
* The Agricultural Bank (1909, formerly the Kosmadopoulos Bank)
* The Cine-theater Achilleion (1925)
* The Aegli Hotel, (1927), designed by Kassiopoulos
* The Building of the Air-force High officials Club near Agios Konstantinos Park, believed to have been designed by Le Corbusier
* The Bank of Greece building (1935)
* Municipal conservatory of Volos
* The old factory of Tsalapatas
* Tsikrikis Mansion 
* Kitsos Makris&#x27; house (today Kitsos Makris Folklore Centre)
* Volos City Hall
* The Railway Station of Volos, designed by Evaristo De Chirico
* The Averofeian Courthouse
* The family houses of Kartalis, Glavanis, Kastemis, Saratsis
* The Sarafopoulos Mansion (1927), today the Volos Club
* The well-preserved Regas house and its singular decorative murals, today the Lyceum of Greek women

==Economy==


Volos is one of the most industrialized provincial cities of Greece, because of its strategic location between the largest population centers of the country (Athens – Thessaloníki) and its port. Industry is intensely specialized in steel production and manufacturing. Three major steel producers (METKA, SIDENOR and Hellenic Steel Industry (Ελληνική Χαλυβουργία)) have production facilities in the industrial areas of Volos and nearby Almyros.
AGET Heracles, a member of the Lafarge group, operates one of the largest cement facilities in the world (with capacity exceeding 7,000,000 tn) with its own private port, next to the city. Volos is also active in the research sector, hosting the Institute of Bio-Economy and Agri-Technology (iBO), one of the five Institutes of the Center for Research and Technology – Hellas (CERTH).

==Port==

The port lies upon the ancient Thessalian settlement of Iolkos. According to Greek mythology, this was where the hero Jason built his trireme, Argo, and along with his oarsmen set course for Colchis, bringing back and marrying priestess Medea.

The new port was founded in 1893 and was the most significant element in the industrial development of the area. Today, Volos has the third-largest cargo port in Greece (after Piraeus and Thessaloniki), carrying agricultural and industrial products. In the past, it was home to a maritime link with Tartus, Syria.

Ferries and flying dolphins operate daily, connecting Volos to the Magnesia islands of the Sporades, (Skiathos, Skopelos, Alonissos). In addition, many cruise ships use the port of Volos as a destination. During the summers of 2015 and 2016, more than 100 cruises arrived in Volos, carrying more than 100,000 visitors.

Moreover, close by Volos, there are the ancient Dimitrias, a town built by Dimitrios Poliorkitis in 294-2 AC. Today, the ancient theatre of Dimitrias remains preserved. Also present are the archaeological areas of Goritsa hill, archaeological findings dating from the early Christian period in Nea Anchialos, and the wall of Volos&#x27;s old castle, which is open to visitors.

Volos consists of a city with diverse Greek trades, as its industrial development encouraged many people to move to the city. The city&#x27;s industrial and financial evolution also gradually resulted in cultural and social evolution, too; in 1894, Volos acquired its Municipal Theater and later its Gymnastics Club. In 1908, Volos became home to the first Labour Union in Greece.

After 1922, following the Asia Minor Catastrophe, Volos received a large number of people from the destroyed regions. This coexistence with the locals deeply influenced the culture of the city, leaving a mark still visible in the food, music, sports, entertainment and social life of the city today.

In modern times, there are plentiful museums and galleries to be visited throughout the city, but also in the wider region. Above all, Volos forms one of the most attractive and tourist-friendly cities in Greece because of its physical setting, combining the Pagasetic Gulf with Mount Pelion.

<text>A labor camp (or labour camp, see spelling differences) or work camp is a detention facility where inmates are forced to engage in penal labor as a form of punishment. Labor camps have many common aspects with slavery and with prisons (especially prison farms). Conditions at labor camps vary widely depending on the operators. Convention no. 105 of the United Nations International Labour Organization (ILO), adopted internationally on 27 June 1957, intended to abolish camps of forced labor.

In the 20th century, a new category of labor camps developed for the imprisonment of millions of people who were not criminals &quot;per se&quot;, but political opponents (real or imagined) and various so-called undesirables under communist and fascist regimes.

== Precursors ==

Early-modern states could exploit convicts by combining prison and useful work in manning their galleys.
This became the sentence of many Christian captives in the Ottoman Empire
and of Calvinists (Huguenots) in pre-Revolutionary France.

==20th century==

===Albania===
===Allies of World War II===
: The Allies of World War II operated a number of work camps after the war. At the Yalta Conference in 1945, it was agreed that German forced labor was to be utilized as reparations. The majority of the camps were in the Soviet Union, but more than one million Germans were forced to work in French coal-mines and British agriculture, as well as 500,000 in US-run Military Labor Service Units in occupied Germany itself. See Forced labor of Germans after World War II.

===Bulgaria===
===Burma===
:According to the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, Burmese military government operated, from 1962 to 2011, about 91 labour camps for political prisoners.

===China===
:The anti-communist Kuomintang operated various camps between 1938 and 1949, including the Northwestern Youth Labor Camp for young activists and students.
:The Chinese Communist Party has operated many labor camps for some crimes at least since taking power in 1949. Many leaders of China were put into labor camps after purges, including Deng Xiaoping and Liu Shaoqi. May Seventh Cadre Schools are an example of Cultural Revolution-era labor camps.

===Cuba===
: Beginning in November 1965, people classified as &quot;against the government&quot; were summoned to work camps referred to as &quot;Military Units to Aid Production&quot; (UMAP).

===Czechoslovakia===
: After the communists took over Czechoslovakia in 1948, many forced labor camps were created. The inmates included political prisoners, clergy, kulaks, Boy Scout leaders and many other groups of people that were considered enemies of the state. About half of the prisoners worked in the uranium mines. These camps lasted until 1961.
: Also between 1950 and 1954 many men were considered &quot;politically unreliable&quot; for compulsory military service, and were conscripted to labour battalions (Czech: &quot;Pomocné technické prapory (PTP)&quot;) instead.

===Communist Hungary===
:Following sentence, political prisoners were imprisoned. To serve this purpose, a large number of internment camps (e.g., in Kistarcsa, Recsk (Recsk forced labor camp), Tiszalök, Kazincbarcika and according to the latest research, in Bernátkút and Sajóbábony) were placed under the supervision of the State Protection Authority. The most notorious of these camps were in Recsk, Kistarcsa, Tiszalök and Kazincbarcika. 

===Italian Libya===
: During the colonisation of Libya the Italians deported most of the Libyan population in Cyrenaica to concentration camps and used the survivors to build in semi-slave conditions the coastal road and new agricultural projects.

===Germany===

: During World War II the Nazis operated several categories of &quot;Arbeitslager&quot; (Labor Camps) for different categories of inmates. The largest number of them held Jewish civilians forcibly abducted in the occupied countries (see Łapanka) to provide labor in the German war industry, repair bombed railroads and bridges or work on farms. By 1944, 19.9% of all workers were foreigners, either civilians or prisoners of war.
:The Nazis employed many slave laborers. They also operated concentration camps, some of which provided free forced labor for industrial and other jobs while others existed purely for the extermination of their inmates. A notable example is the Mittelbau-Dora labor camp complex that serviced the production of the V-2 rocket. See List of German concentration camps for more.

:The Nazi camps played a key role in the extermination of millions. The phrase (&quot;Work makes one free&quot;) has become a symbol of The Holocaust.

===Imperial Japan===
: During the early 20th century, the Empire of Japan used the forced labor of millions of civilians from conquered countries and prisoners of war, especially during the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Pacific War, on projects such as the Death Railway. Hundreds of thousands of people died as a direct result of the overwork, malnutrition, preventable disease and violence which were commonplace on these projects. 

===North Korea===
:North Korea is known to operate six camps with prison-labor colonies for political criminals (Kwan-li-so). The total number of prisoners in these colonies is 150,000 to 200,000. Once condemned as a political criminal in North Korea, the defendant and his/or her family are incarcerated for life in one of the camps without trial and cut off from all outside contact.

===Romania===
===Russia and the Soviet Union===

: Imperial Russia operated a system of remote Siberian forced labor camps as part of its regular judicial system, called katorga.

: The Soviet Union took over the already extensive katorga system and expanded it immensely, eventually organizing the Gulag to run the camps. In 1954, a year after Stalin&#x27;s death, the new Soviet government of Nikita Khrushchev began to release political prisoners and close down the camps. By the end of the 1950s, virtually all &quot;corrective labor camps&quot; were reorganized, mostly into the system of corrective labor colonies. Officially, the Gulag was terminated by the MVD order 20 of January 25, 1960.

: During the period of Stalinism, the Gulag labor camps in the Soviet Union were officially called &quot;Corrective labor camps&quot;. The term &quot;labor colony&quot;; more exactly, &quot;Corrective labor colony&quot;, (, abbr. &quot;ИТК&quot;), was also in use, most notably the ones for underaged (16 years or younger) convicts and captured &quot;besprizorniki&quot; (street children, literally, &quot;children without family care&quot;). After the reformation of the camps into the Gulag, the term &quot;corrective labor colony&quot; essentially encompassed labor camps.

====Russian Federation====
===Sweden===

: 14 labor camps were operated by the Swedish state during World War II. The majority of internees were communists, but radical social democrats, syndicalists, anarchists, trade unionists, anti-fascists and other &quot;unreliable elements&quot; of Swedish society, as well as German dissidents and deserters from the Wehrmacht, were also interned. The internees were placed in the labor camps indefinitely, without trial, and without being informed of the accusations made against them. Officially, the camps were called &quot;labor companies&quot; (Swedish: &quot;arbetskompanier&quot;). The system was established by the Royal Board of Social Affairs and sanctioned by the third cabinet of Per Albin Hansson, a grand coalition which included all parties represented in the Swedish Riksdag, with the notable exception of the Communist Party of Sweden.

: After the war, many former camp inmates had difficulty finding a job, since they had been branded as &quot;subversive elements&quot;.

===Turkey===
===United States===
:During the United States occupation of Haiti, the United States Marine Corps and their Gendarmerie of Haiti subordinates enforced a corvée system upon Haitians. The corvée resulted in the deaths of hundreds, and possibly thousands, of Haitians, with Haitian American academic Michel-Rolph Trouillot estimating that about 5,500 Haitians died in labor camps. In addition, Roger Gaillard writes that some Haitians were killed fleeing the camps or if they did not work satisfactorily.

===Vietnam===
===Yugoslavia===
: The Goli Otok prison camp for political opponents ran from 1946 to 1956.

==21st century==
===China===

: The Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, which closed on December 28, 2013, passed a decision on abolishing the legal provisions on reeducation through labor. However, penal labor allegedly continues to exist in Xinjiang internment camps.
===North Korea===

: North Korea is known to operate six camps with prison-labor colonies for political criminals (Kwan-li-so). The total number of prisoners in these colonies is 150,000 – 200,000. Once condemned as a political criminal in North Korea, the defendant and their families are incarcerated for lifetime in one of the camps without trial, and are cut off from all outside contact.
===United States===

:In 1997, a United States Army document was developed that &quot;provides guidance on establishing prison camps on [US] Army installations.&quot;

<text>Kensington High Street is the main shopping street in Kensington, London, England. The area is identified in the London Plan as one of 35 major centres in Greater London.

Kensington High Street is the continuation of Kensington Road and part of the A315. It starts by the entrance to Kensington Palace and runs westward through central Kensington. Near Kensington (Olympia) station, where the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea ends and London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham begins, it ends and becomes Hammersmith Road. The street is served by High Street Kensington underground station.

==History==
In 1682, Francis Barry purchased land in Kensington and began to develop houses.

From the 1690s to 1893, Kensington High Street was developed around a residential terrace, with large houses occupied by a number of distinguished residents. The Terrace was located roughly between present-day Wrights Lane and Adam and Eve Mews.

Residents have included:

* Sir Graham Berry, Premier of Victoria, Australia
* Sir Henry Cole, museum founder
* Reverend George Davys, tutor to Queen Victoria
* Kenelm Digby, writer
* Lady Christiana Gayer, daughter of Robert Bruce, 1st Earl of Ailesbury
* John Leech, cartoonist
* Sir David Wilkie, artist.

==Retail centre==

Kensington High Street is one of West London most popular shopping streets, with upmarket shops serving a wealthy area. From the late 19th century until the mid-1970s the street had three classic department stores: Barkers of Kensington, Derry &amp; Toms and Pontings. Barkers bought Pontings in 1906 and Derry &amp; Toms in 1920, but continued to run all three as separate entities. In a large building project, which started in 1930 and was not complete until 1958 (the Second World War halted the project), the company made Derry &amp; Toms and Barkers into Art Deco palaces. On top of Derry &amp; Toms, Europe&#x27;s largest roof garden area () was created, consisting of three different gardens with 500 species of plants, fountains, a stream, duck, flamingos and a restaurant – said to serve the best high tea in Kensington.

In 1957, House of Fraser bought the Barkers Group and started to dismantle it. Pontings was closed in 1971, Derry &amp; Toms in 1973, and a much condensed Barkers (from over seven floors to on less than four floors) was allowed to continue until January 2006, when the 135-year-old department store was closed for good.

Part of the Barker premises has now been taken over by American Whole Foods Market, which opened the UK&#x27;s first organic superstore there in June 2007. The rest was added to existing office space used by the headquarters of Associated Newspapers.

Kensington High Street was also the site of Biba in the 1960s and early 1970s. When Derry &amp; Toms closed, the iconic store took the building and accentuated its Art Deco style further. But the 1970s recession, coupled with idealistic business ideas, killed Biba in 1975. The Derry &amp; Toms roof gardens still remain, now known as the Kensington Roof Gardens which Richard Branson&#x27;s Virgin occupied as a tenant from 1981 to 2018.

Kensington Market opened on Kensington High Street in 1967. It was a three story building of contemporary fashion. It closed in 2000.

Kensington High Street&#x27;s future as a shopping street has been threatened by the large Westfield London, which opened a short distance away in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush in late 2008. However, these factors may be offset to some extent – or even outweighed – by recent changes to the road layout, intended to make the street a more pleasant place to shop. The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea decided to experiment with the concept of shared space, which deputy leader Daniel Moylan had studied abroad. Railings and pedestrian crossings were removed, thereby enabling pedestrians to cross the street wherever they choose. Bicycle racks were placed on the central reservation. The effect over two years was a reduction in accidents, down 44% against a London average of 17%.

Kensington High Street is also home to a large part of the British music industry, with the UK offices of major labels such as Universal Music Group, Sony Music, Warner Music Group and EMI all situated in the area.

Furthermore, the second Kahn Design boutique in London is also located on this street.

It is also the site of the former Roman Catholic Pro-Cathedral of England, Our Lady of Victories, now a parish church; Kensington Arcade; and a building housing the Consulate of Romania and the Embassy of Paraguay.

==Transport links==
Kensington High Street is served by bus routes 9, 23, 27, 28, 49, 52, 70, 328, 452, C1, night routes N9, N27, N28, N31 and Greenline routes 701 and 702. It is also served by High Street Kensington Underground station, on the Circle and District lines.

<text>USS &quot;F-1&quot; (SS-20) was an F-class submarine. She was named &quot;Carp&quot; when her keel was laid down by Union Iron Works of San Francisco, California, making her the first ship of the United States Navy named for the carp. She was launched on 6 September 1911 sponsored by Ms. J. Tynan, renamed &quot;F-1&quot; on 17 November 1911, and commissioned on 19 June 1912.

==Service history==
Assigned to the First Submarine Group, Pacific Torpedo Flotilla, &quot;F-1&quot; operated in the San Francisco, California area on trials and tests through 11 January 1913, when she joined the flotilla for training at sea between San Diego, California and San Pedro Submarine Base, San Pedro, California, then in San Diego Harbor. 
In late 1912, the boat — which then held the world&#x27;s deep diving record, descending to — slipped her mooring at Port Watsonville in Monterey Bay, California, and grounded on a nearby beach. While most of the crew of 17 safely evacuated, two men died in the incident.

From 21 July 1914 to 14 November 1915, the flotilla was based at Honolulu, Hawaii&#x27;s Naval Submarine Base Pearl Harbor for development operations in the Hawaiian Islands.

&quot;F-1&quot; was in ordinary from 15 March 1916 to 13 June 1917. When she returned to full commission, she served with the Patrol Force, Pacific, making surface and submerged runs to continue her part in the development of submarine tactics. Her base during this time was San Pedro, California. On 17 December 1917, while maneuvering in exercises off Point Loma, San Diego, California, &quot;F-1&quot; and collided, the former sinking in ten seconds, her port side torn forward of the engine room. Nineteen of her men were lost; the remaining three were rescued by the submarines with which she was operating.

<doc id="422892" wikidata="Q4096431" url="?curid=422892" title="Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart">
<text>Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart, fully Brigadier Sir Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart, generally referred to simply as the Brigadier, is a fictional character in the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, created by writers Mervyn Haisman and Henry Lincoln and played by Nicholas Courtney. He is one of the founders of UNIT (United Nations Intelligence Taskforce, later Unified Intelligence Taskforce), an international organisation that defends Earth from alien threats, and serves as commander of the British contingent. Presented at first as reluctant to accept the continuing aid of the Doctor, over time the Brigadier became one of the Doctor&#x27;s greatest friends and his principal ally in defending Earth.

As one of the series&#x27; most prominent recurring characters over its history, the Brigadier appeared in 23 stories during the original run of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, first appearing in the 1968 serial &quot;The Web of Fear&quot; opposite the Second Doctor (Patrick Troughton). The character made frequent appearances on the series following the introduction of the Third Doctor (Jon Pertwee) in 1970&#x27;s &quot;Spearhead from Space&quot;. His final appearance in the program was in 1989&#x27;s &quot;Battlefield&quot; opposite the Seventh Doctor (Sylvester McCoy). Nearly 20 years later, Courtney reprised the role in the DVD Special Feature called &quot;Liberty Hall&quot; in 2009 written by Karen Davies and directed by Brendan Sheppard in which the Brigadier was interviewed by a Times journalist. Then he finally appeared in the spin-off programme &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; in 2008, his last appearance prior to Courtney&#x27;s death in 2011. That year, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; later paid tribute to Courtney by announcing the Brigadier had died with a line of dialogue in &quot;The Wedding of River Song&quot;. Later still, a Cyberman avatar of the Brigadier also appears, and achieves some closure with the Twelfth Doctor (Peter Capaldi), in &quot;Death in Heaven&quot; (2014).

The 2012 episode &quot;The Power of Three&quot; introduced the Brigadier&#x27;s daughter, new UNIT chief Kate Stewart (Jemma Redgrave). The character was originally created in the unlicensed video spin-off &quot;Downtime&quot; in 1995, in which the Brigadier also appeared. Kate becomes a recurring character making appearances alongside every Doctor from the Tenth to the Fifteenth.

==Character history==

Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart&#x27;s ancestry goes back to Scotland, according to dialogue in &quot;Terror of the Zygons&quot; (1975). He first encounters the Second Doctor in &quot;The Web of Fear&quot; (1968), when Lethbridge-Stewart is a lieutenant-colonel in the Scots Guards commanding a British Army detachment sent to investigate the Yeti in the London Underground. By his next appearance in &quot;The Invasion&quot; (1968), he had been promoted to brigadier and was working with UNIT. When the Doctor was forcibly regenerated and exiled to Earth, Lethbridge-Stewart gave him a position as UNIT&#x27;s scientific advisor after he helped defeat the Auton invasion. Other military members of UNIT included Captain Mike Yates, Sergeant Benton and Royal Navy Lieutenant Harry Sullivan.

Most of the stories about the Third Doctor were set on Earth and feature UNIT and the Brigadier heavily. While not as ubiquitous in following years, he appeared alongside every subsequent Doctor in the original television series run, excluding the Sixth Doctor, with whom he appeared only in the 30th anniversary special, &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot; in 1993. Although Lethbridge-Stewart first met the Doctor in his second incarnation, he also met and worked with the First Doctor in the opening serial of the 10th anniversary season, &quot;The Three Doctors&quot; and again in the 20th-anniversary special, &quot;The Five Doctors&quot;. He eventually retired from the military to teach mathematics at an English public school in 1976, as seen in &quot;Mawdryn Undead&quot; (1983). The Brigadier and the Sixth Doctor, as well as later incarnations of the Doctor, have been paired in numerous spin-off productions (see Other appearances).

As one of the most popular recurring supporting characters in the television series, the Brigadier is often listed among the Doctor&#x27;s companions. He is listed as such by the BBC and is included in a book by John Nathan-Turner&#x27;s (a former producer of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;) discussing all the Doctor&#x27;s companions.

Lethbridge-Stewart&#x27;s last appearance in a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television episode was in 1989, in the Seventh Doctor serial &quot;Battlefield&quot;. Called out of retirement to deal with an other-dimensional invasion of armoured knights led by Morgaine, he found himself once again at the Doctor&#x27;s side. Lethbridge-Stewart served as his world&#x27;s champion as he faced down and killed the demonic Destroyer of Worlds armed only with his service revolver and a load of silver-tipped bullets. (&quot;Battlefield&quot; was stated to be a few years into Ace&#x27;s future but not a specific date. The Virgin New Adventures books place it in 1997.)

Little was shown of Lethbridge-Stewart&#x27;s life outside UNIT in the television series. &quot;Planet of the Spiders&quot; referred to a relationship with a woman called Doris. By &quot;Battlefield&quot;, he was married to her (played by Angela Douglas). It was Courtney&#x27;s own belief that the Brigadier had been in a previous marriage to a woman named Fiona, and that he and Doris were having an affair; his first marriage ended due to his work.

Although Lethbridge-Stewart never appeared in the revived series, the character is still alive during the Tenth Doctor&#x27;s tenure. In the spin-off programme &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; story &quot;Revenge of the Slitheen&quot;, Sarah Jane Smith says to &quot;give [her] love to the Brig&quot;. In the Tenth Doctor episode &quot;The Poison Sky&quot;, the Doctor mentions that he could use the help of &quot;the Brigadier&quot;. He is then told that &quot;Sir Alistair&quot; is &quot;stranded in Peru&quot;, indicating that the Brigadier has been knighted by this time. The first film footage from the classic era to appear in the revived era was his photograph displayed in the slow pan across Sarah Jane Smith&#x27;s attic in the opening scene of &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;″ première, &quot;Invasion of the Bane&quot;.

In 2008, Courtney again reprised the role in a &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; story, &quot;Enemy of the Bane&quot;, and confirmed his knighthood repeatedly: Major Kilburne and Sarah Jane each address him as &quot;Sir Alistair&quot; and he later introduces himself fully as &quot;Brigadier Sir Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart&quot; to Mrs. Wormwood. This episode refers back to the Peru mission as there is mention of him being de-briefed about it. Sarah Jane asks Lethbridge-Stewart to assist her in accessing UNIT&#x27;s &quot;Black Archive&quot;, a top secret alien artefact facility first alluded to by Douglas Cavendish to Sir Alistair&#x27;s daughter in &quot;Dæmos Rising&quot;. Sarah Jane prefers to avoid seeking official clearance, to avoid awkward questions about Luke, her artificially-grown son. In his old age, the Brigadier has developed a dislike for the new way UNIT works and often refers to events that happened in &quot;his day&quot;. He walks with a walking stick now, but is seen driving a Bentley T-series to UNIT&#x27;s &quot;Black Archive&quot;. His wife (presumably Doris) is mentioned in this episode. The Brigadier assists Sarah Jane and Rani in escaping UNIT and later confronts a Bane disguised as a UNIT officer, shooting him dead with a gun hidden within his cane.

In &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; story &quot;The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith&quot;, Clyde Langer tells Peter Dalton that the Brigadier cannot make it to the wedding because he is back in Peru. It had been intended by the production team that Lethbridge-Stewart would indeed appear in the story and meet the Tenth Doctor, but Courtney was recovering from a stroke and unable to take part. He is reported to be in Peru for a third time in &quot;Death of the Doctor&quot; (2010). Clyde describes him as being Sarah Jane&#x27;s oldest friend; Sarah Jane met both the Doctor and Sir Alistair in the first episode of the Third Doctor serial, &quot;The Time Warrior&quot; (1974).

In 2009, Courtney reprised the role for a final time in the short film &quot;Liberty Hall&quot;, an extra for &quot;Mawdryn Undead&quot;″s DVD release. The film is a seven-minute mockumentary where a fictional journalist interviews the Brigadier about his life. The Brigadier discusses his marriages with Fiona and Doris, and mentions his daughter Kate and grandson Gordon (referencing &quot;Downtime&quot;). He states that his most recent encounter with the Doctor took place in 2000, when he was on unofficial UNIT business in Malebolgia in the United States (referencing the Eighth Doctor audio drama &quot;Minuet in Hell&quot;). He concludes, &quot;So, now I&#x27;ve hung up my uniform for good... unless I hear that a blue police box has been found somewhere, and then, don&#x27;t you worry, I&#x27;ll be ready!&quot;

Sometime later, the Brigadier becomes ill and is moved into a nursing home. In 2011&#x27;s &quot;The Wedding of River Song&quot;, the Eleventh Doctor rings the nursing home to have the Brigadier made ready for a trip; a nurse regretfully informs him that the Brigadier died peacefully &quot;a few months ago&quot; and had spoken well of him often, insisting a glass always be kept ready for him in case he turned up. The Doctor is visibly shattered by the news, which forces him to realise that he can&#x27;t avoid his predestined death.

In the 2014 episode &quot;Death in Heaven&quot;, Missy (the regenerated female Master) resurrects the Earth&#x27;s dead as flight-capable Cybermen. The Brigadier&#x27;s daughter Kate is apparently killed falling from a plane during a Cybermen attack. Overcoming his programming, the converted Danny Pink commands the Cybermen to sacrifice themselves to thwart Missy&#x27;s plan. The Doctor prepares to execute Missy, but is preempted by a lone surviving Cyberman, who seemingly vaporizes her with a forearm-mounted ray-gun. Finding that the Cyberman has rescued Kate, the Doctor realizes it is the converted Brigadier, saying &quot;Of course! Earth&#x27;s darkest hour, and mine. Where else would you be?&quot; Overcome with emotion, the Doctor salutes him – something Kate said her father had always wanted – and the Brigadier fires his leg jets and flies away. What happens to him afterward is left unknown.

In the 2017 Christmas special &quot;Twice Upon a Time&quot;, the First and Twelfth Doctors unwittingly intervene when Testimony, an organization in the far future that collect memories from those about to die, retrieve a seemingly-innocuous captain in the First World War from the moment before his death, the temporal anomaly of the two Doctors resisting their imminent regenerations disrupting Testimony&#x27;s efforts to return the captain to his scheduled death. The Doctors are able to bend the rules and return the captain to a point a couple of hours after he was taken out of time, in time for his life to be saved by the Christmas truce. Before he returns to time, the captain reveals that his name is Archibald Hamish Lethbridge-Stewart, suggesting that he is a relative of the Brigadier. Although not confirmed on-screen, Gatiss later confirmed in an interview with Radio Times that the character is one of the Brigadier&#x27;s grandfathers.

==Other appearances==
The Brigadier and the Sixth Doctor were paired in the two-part charity special &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot; and the Big Finish audio play, &quot;The Spectre of Lanyon Moor&quot;. The Sixth Doctor also meets the Brigadier in the novel &quot;Business Unusual&quot;, also purporting to be the first meeting of the two characters, subsequently working together in &quot;The Shadow in the Glass&quot; to track down the newly discovered Fourth Reich; in the short story &quot;Brief Encounter: A Wee Deoch an..?&quot;, written by Sixth Doctor actor Colin Baker and published in &quot;Doctor Who Magazine Winter Special&quot;, 1991, they cross paths but neither realises it. The Brigadier has also appeared with the Eighth Doctor in the novel &quot;The Eight Doctors&quot; by Terrance Dicks (set after the events of the TV Movie and during moments of The Doctors&#x27; past lives) in audio plays and the novels &quot;The Dying Days&quot; and &quot;The Shadows of Avalon&quot;. The Tenth Doctor met the Brigadier in the &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; comic &quot;The Warkeeper&#x27;s Crown&quot;.

The Brigadier and his family have made several appearances in the spin-off media. The spin-off UNIT videos &quot;Downtime&quot; and &quot;Dæmos Rising&quot; feature Kate Lethbridge-Stewart, the Brigadier&#x27;s daughter from his marriage to his first wife, Fiona (first named in the Missing Adventure &quot;The Scales of Injustice&quot; by Gary Russell). Also appearing was Kate&#x27;s young son, Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart. Kate also played her UNIT role in the fiftieth anniversary episode, &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot; (2013).

The novels also gave Lethbridge-Stewart another offspring. While on duty in Sierra Leone as a young lieutenant, Lethbridge-Stewart met and was intimate with a local girl named Mariatu, the daughter of a village chief, and unknown to Lethbridge-Stewart, she had a son. This was first hinted at in Ben Aaronovitch&#x27;s novelisation of his 1988 serial &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot;, which featured quotes from a fictional history of UNIT (&quot;The Zen Military&quot;) written by a Kadiatu Lethbridge-Stewart (Mariatu&#x27;s granddaughter) in 2006. In the 1992 New Adventures novel &quot;Transit&quot; (also by Aaronovitch, and set in the 22nd Century), the Seventh Doctor meets the adopted daughter of General Yembe Lethbridge-Stewart, one of Mariatu&#x27;s descendants. This daughter, also named Kadiatu Lethbridge-Stewart, went on to become a recurring character in the New Adventures.

The novels have also fleshed out the Brigadier&#x27;s ancestry, establishing that he comes from a long-standing military family. In the New Adventures novel &quot;The Dying Days&quot; by Lance Parkin, he talks about three ancestors who reached the rank of general. One, William Lethbridge-Stewart, was in the retinue of James VI of Scotland and I of England. The other two fought at Naseby and Waterloo. &quot;The Scales of Injustice&quot; names the latter as Major-General Fergus Lethbridge-Stewart. The Brigadier also says in &quot;The Dying Days&quot; that his father died in World War II, fighting alongside Field-Marshal Montgomery in Africa.

The Past Doctor Adventures novel &quot;The Wages of Sin&quot; by David A. McIntee established that the Brigadier had an ancestor named Alastair Lethbridge-Stewart who worked for the British Government in 1916. &quot;Deadly Reunion&quot; by Terrance Dicks and Barry Letts establishes that the Brigadier was a Second Lieutenant serving in Army Intelligence in 1944, although this makes the Brigadier older than other stories would suggest.

In the novels, Lethbridge-Stewart emerged from retirement again during the events of &quot;The Dying Days&quot; where he dealt with an invasion of Ice Warriors from Mars in 1997. At the end of that novel he was promoted to General. Lethbridge-Stewart was subsequently rejuvenated with alien technology in &quot;Happy Endings&quot; by Paul Cornell, taking place in 2010. The rejuvenated Lethbridge-Stewart, widowed as a result of an accident at sea but back with the military, next appeared in the BBC Books Eighth Doctor Adventures novel &quot;The Shadows of Avalon&quot;, also by Cornell, where he still held the rank of General but preferred to be called &quot;the Brigadier&quot;. According to &quot;The King of Terror&quot; by Keith Topping, Lethbridge-Stewart eventually passes away in the early 2050s.

Courtney played the Brigadier in two BBC Radio 4 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; plays set during the Third Doctor&#x27;s era, &quot;The Paradise of Death&quot; (1993) and &quot;The Ghosts of N-Space&quot; (1996), alongside Pertwee and Elisabeth Sladen as Sarah Jane Smith. For Big Finish, he has played the part of Lethbridge-Stewart in several plays, with &quot;Minuet in Hell&quot; revealing that he played a role in the establishment of the Scottish Parliament and also that he does covert work for the UN as a plausibly deniable agent. He also played an alternate universe version of the Brigadier in the &quot;Doctor Who Unbound&quot; play &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot;, opposite David Warner as the Doctor and David Tennant (later cast as the Tenth Doctor) as Colonel Brimmecombe-Wood. At the conclusion of &quot;Sympathy&quot;, the alternate Brigadier- referred to as &#x27;Alistair&#x27;- joins Warner&#x27;s Doctor as his companion, but after an unspecified amount of time travelling together, they part ways in the later audio &quot;Masters of War&quot;, when the two arrive on Skaro and force the Daleks and the Thals to join forces to fight off an invasion by a race known as the Quatch, Alistair remaining once the Quatch are defeated to help the two sides maintain their new truce.

Courtney also voiced the Brigadier in the 2001 webcast &quot;Death Comes to Time&quot;.

In December 2004, Big Finish released the first of a series of UNIT-based audio plays, where General Sir Alistair Lethbridge-Stewart acted as a consultant to a new generation of officers and by series&#x27; end became UNIT&#x27;s new Scientific Advisor. If the events in this series are to be reconciled with the books, these plays would seem to take place between the events of &quot;The Dying Days&quot; and &quot;Happy Endings&quot;, as this version of Lethbridge-Stewart does not seem to be rejuvenated. Also, the public does not believe in existence of aliens, which would appear to place it before the events of &quot;The Christmas Invasion&quot;.

In the &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; comic strip story &quot;Warkeeper&#x27;s Crown&quot; (DWM #378–380), Lethbridge-Stewart made a reappearance alongside the Tenth Doctor after being kidnapped by Warlords as a tactical commander. He was an old officer stationed at Sandhurst.

A series of novels featuring the young Colonel Lethbridge-Stewart has been published by Candy Jar Books since 2015. The novels are licensed by the literary estate of co-creator Mervyn Haisman and endorsed by Henry Lincoln.

In 2017, &quot;The Third Doctor Adventures- Volume Five&quot; features Jon Culshaw acting as the Brigadier in a series of audios set during the Third Doctor&#x27;s era.

In &quot;The Legacy of Time&quot;, a special six-part audio to celebrate Big Finish&#x27;s twentieth anniversary of producing &quot;Doctor Who&quot;-related audios, the story &quot;The Sacrifice of Jo Grant&quot; sees Jo Grant and Kate Stewart of the present day being sent back to the 1970s by a series of temporal rifts, where they meet the Third Doctor as he investigates the anomalies in his time. While Kate attempts to avoid introducing herself to limit the risk of a paradox, the Doctor realizes her identity and convinces her to call her father, introducing herself as the commander of UNIT in the future without identifying herself by name, with the Brigadier (voiced by Jon Culshaw once again) telling her that he is assured that the future of UNIT is in good hands.

==References outside of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;==
The character also appears briefly in a cameo role at the end of writer Paul Cornell&#x27;s novelisation of the 1997 ITV science-fiction serial &quot;The Uninvited&quot;. Although the character is not named in the book, the description is that of Lethbridge-Stewart and Cornell later admitted that this was indeed his intention.

Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Excalibur&quot; featured an organisation called W.H.O. (the Weird Happenings Organisation) run by a Brigadier Alysande Stuart. Her twin brother Alistaire was WHO&#x27;s &quot;scientific advisor&quot; (the role the Doctor had in UNIT). A character named &quot;Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart&quot; had earlier appeared in three panels of &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #218, supervising the arrest of the Juggernaut in Edinburgh, where he also calls out to a &quot;Sergeant-Major Benton&quot; at one point.

The Sherlock Holmes novel &quot;Waters of Death&quot; by Kel Richards features a naval commander called Ralph Lethbridge-Stewart, alongside Captain Harry Sullivan and Lieutenant Philip Benton. It is set in the same fictional location as the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;Terror of the Zygons&quot;.

An unnamed army brigadier, who looks and acts very similar to Lethbridge-Stewart, appears in the comic strip &quot;Caballistics, Inc.&quot; He first appeared in the story &quot;Going Underground&quot;, where he is in charge of the army&#x27;s response following a demon invasion of the London Underground; a member of his SAS team refers to &quot;bloody robot yetis&quot; having been down there once. He shows up again in the story &quot;Ashes&quot;, in charge of the military response to a devastating attack on Glasgow. This character is one of several references to both the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; universe and other sci-fi/horror properties in &quot;Caballistics&quot;.

Although unnamed, two characters strongly resembling Lethbridge-Stewart and Sergeant Benton (who was specifically named) appear in the John M. Ford &quot;Star Trek&quot; novel &quot;How Much for Just the Planet?&quot; at a rather treacherous golf course on the planet Direidi.

Similarly to Alysande Stuart, the comic book &quot;Jack Staff&quot; includes Commander Liz Stewart of S.M.I.L.E. (Secret Military Intelligence Lethal Executive).

The Brigadier briefly appears in Kim Newman and Eugene Byrne&#x27;s &quot;Back in the USSA&quot;, supporting Britain&#x27;s involvement in an alternate Vietnam War.

The Brigadier was referenced in name in the ABC Family show &quot;The Middleman&quot;. In the episode &quot;The Clotharian Contamination Protocol&quot;, Wendy and The Middleman go to check out a returned Voyager probe. However, a nearby NASA listening station team also arrives. Using their random IDs, and due to the quick thinking of the Middleman, they are intimidated into leaving. As they go, the Middleman calls out the other team&#x27;s lead, &quot;Mr... Lethbridge-Stewart, if that is your real name!&quot;

<text>InterNorth Inc. was a large energy company headquartered at the Northern Natural Gas Building in Omaha, Nebraska, in the United States, specializing in natural gas pipelines but also a force in the plastics industry, coal and petroleum exploration and production. It was a predecessor to Enron Corporation.

InterNorth was founded in 1931 as Northern Natural Gas Company. Over the years, it acquired several other subsidiaries, such as Northern Liquid Fuels Company, Northern Petrochemicals Company, Northern Propane Gas Company, Northern Border Pipeline Company, and People&#x27;s Natural Gas. In March 1980, Northern Natural Gas reorganized as a holding company, InterNorth. They operated the largest natural gas pipeline in North America (approximately 36,000 miles of pipeline).

In 1980-81, the company launched an unsolicited takeover bid for Crouse-Hinds Company, which wound up being acquired by Cooper Industries the following year. The company continued to pursue expansion opportunities. In 1983, the company purchased the Belco Petroleum Company, a Fortune 500 oil exploration and development company founded by Arthur Belfer; and, in 1985, reached a deal, seen by some as overpriced, to acquire the smaller competitor Houston Natural Gas Company (HNG). InterNorth was an arbitrage target and acquired HNG as a poison pill.

Following its takeover of HNG, InterNorth was renamed to HNG/Internorth, a name it would keep for nine months before being rechristened Enron Corp. in April 1986.

Although intended to secure InterNorth&#x27;s independence, the HNG takeover proved a &quot;wag-the-dog&quot; transaction: despite an initial plan for dual headquarters in Omaha and Houston, with InterNorth CEO Samuel Segnar in control, the company soon was based entirely in Houston and run by HNG&#x27;s CEO, Ken Lay. Initially, Lay and his secretary were on board with design consultancy Lippincott &amp; Margulies’s pitched name, Enteron, due to the positive connotations of the words &quot;enter&quot; and &quot;on&#x27;, though it was soon discovered to be a medical term for the intestines. The markets reacted with hilarity and within a month the name up for vote was changed to Enron.

The merged company was a target of corporate raider Irwin Jacobs of Minneapolis. Lay &quot;borrowed&quot; over $400 million from the employee stock ownership program to buy back Jacobs stock, so he could keep his job and cover other financial losses of Enron as early as 1987. Lay then froze the ESOP for seven years except for retirement or death benefits.

The most valuable asset of Internorth had been Northern Natural Gas, which was at one time the largest natural gas distributor in North America. After the bankruptcy of Enron, Northern Natural Gas briefly became part of Dynegy Corp, whose chairman, Daniel Dienstbier, had been president of Northern before Ken Lay seized control of Internorth. Dynegy then sold Northern to Warren Buffett&#x27;s Berkshire Hathaway who moved it back to Omaha.

<text>Homero Rómulo Cristalli Frasnelli (January 20, 1912 – May 14, 1981), better known under the pseudonym J. Posadas or sometimes Juan Posadas, was an Argentine Trotskyist whose personal vision is usually described as Posadism. Originally a collective pen name of the leadership of the &quot;Grupo Cuarta Internacional&quot; in Argentina in the 1940s, it was also used by Dante Minazzoli initially. 
==Early life==
Born in Argentina to Italian immigrants from the Southern town of Matera, Cristalli grew up in intense poverty in Buenos Aires with at least nine siblings. After the death of his mother, he and his brothers and sisters had to beg from neighbours and do odd jobs for pennies in order to survive. Malnourishment left him with permanent health problems but also influenced his views of capitalism.

He gained fame playing football for in his youth. In the 1930s, he worked as a shoemaker and organised a shoemakers’ and leather workers’ union in Córdoba, Argentina.

During this period he stood as a candidate for election in Buenos Aires province for the . He then joined the Partido de la Revolución Socialista, which affiliated to the Fourth International in 1941 but the party quickly declined. In 1947, Cristalli and Dante Minazzoli founded the Grupo Cuarta Internacional (GCI) as a small circle of working class militants committed to Trotskyism.

==In the Trotskyist movement==
Posadas did initially organize the Latin America Bureau of the Fourth International for the International Secretariat faction of the Fourth International in the 1950s. Under his guidance, the movement gained some influence in the region, particularly among Cuban railway workers, Bolivian tin miners and agricultural workers in Brazil.

When the Fourth International split in 1953, Posadas and his followers sided with Michel Pablo and the International Secretariat of the Fourth International. By 1959, however, he and his followers were quarrelling with the leadership of the ISFI accusing them of lacking confidence in the possibility of revolution. They also differed over the issue of nuclear war with Posadas taking the view that &quot;War–Revolution&quot; would &quot;settle the hash of Stalinism and Capitalism&quot; and that nuclear war was inevitable as a socialist society would rise from the ashes.

With Luis Naguill, Posadas directed the &quot;subversive apparatus&quot; founded according to instructions from the Tri-Continental - the Peasant Workers Alliance in 1966.

Conflicts between Posadas and the ISFI started to get worse. The man Homero, who is known as Posadas today, received his new name as it was used as the penname for the letters written to the ISFI. In those letters, Posadas and his followers made bold criticisms such as Trotskyist movements worldwide were largely influenced by the &quot;Bureau of Latin America&quot; (BLA) of the Fourth International at that time, and that the Europeans had become a passive force. Despite the alleged efforts of both the BLA and ISFI to reconcile, in the April of 1962, Posadas made a daring move as he called for a congress and completely reorganized the executive committee of the ISFI, now led by BLA leaders. The ISFI responded to this action in June by suspending BLA from the Fourth International. Posadas and his international followers, who were concentrated in Latin America, decided to split from the ISFI in 1962 (prior to its reunification with the International Committee of the Fourth International which formed the United Secretariat of the Fourth International) and founded a new group.

==Posadista Fourth International==
The &quot;Posadists&quot; founded their own Fourth International in 1962 after having called an Emergency Conference. The first regular international meeting of the Posadists should only happen in March 1964. It was announced as the &quot;Seventh Congress of the Fourth International&quot;. Said Congress was - according to a post conference communique - held &quot;in Europe&quot; without giving further elaboration, and the communique claimed that &quot;delegates representing thirteen countries of Africa, Europe, and Latin America&quot; were in attendance. The new International only started using the name Fourth International (Posadist) at a later time (in the early 1970s).

The Posadist Fourth international developed a concept of its organizational nature, with changes that were introduced in 1966 which varied substantially from the rest of the Trotskyist movement. Posadas commented on their &quot;Tenth World Congress&quot; in 1975:

&quot;There was not a single dispute. It is the most homogeneous Congress, not because we put disputes aside, but because there was no room for disputes. [... I]f the movement is not monolithic and centralizedly monolithic, it leaves the condition open to insecurity, to doubt, to preoccupation with irrelevant problems or secondary problems: then it distracts attention.&quot;[sic]

==Atomic war==
At their 1964 &quot;Seventh World Congress&quot; the following resolution was adopted:

“We are preparing ourselves for a stage in which before the atomic war, we shall struggle for power, during the atomic war we shall struggle for power and we shall be in power, and immediately after the atomic war we shall be in power. There is no beginning, there is an end to atomic war, because atomic war is simultaneous. Simultaneity doesn&#x27;t mean the same day and the same hour. Great historic events should not be measured by hours or days, but by periods. The working class alone will maintain itself, will immediately have to seek its cohesion and centralization&quot;.

This stance was made more specific at a 1966 meeting of the International Secretariat, where a manifesto written by Posadas was adopted:

&quot;After destruction commences, the masses are going to emerge in all countries – in a short time, in a few hours. Capitalism cannot defend itself in an atomic war except by putting itself in caves and attempting to destroy all that it can. The masses, in contrast, are going to come out, will have to come out, because it is the only way to survive, defeating the enemy… The apparatus of capitalism, police, army, will not be able to resist… It will be necessary to organise the workers&#x27; power immediately.&quot;

One of the best-known positions of J. Posadas was his enthusiasm for nuclear war. More precisely, at the height of the Cold War, Posadas thought that nuclear war was inevitable. His idea was that rather than wait for the forces of capitalism, the nuclear-armed socialist states should launch a preemptive attack that would destroy the nuclear capabilities of capitalist countries. Additionally, he believed that this sort of catastrophe could spark the world revolution.

Posadas vocally opposed the Partial Test Ban Treaty signed in 1963 by the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, believing that a nuclear war between the US and the Soviet Union was inevitable and desirable, and would create the conditions for socialism, with the &quot;workers&#x27; states&quot; winning and resetting society.

== Outlook towards the Soviet-Bloc regimes ==
The Posadists held to mainstream Trotskyist notions of describing the Soviet Republics that were established with the end of World War 2 as &quot;deformed workers&#x27; states&quot; based on the existence of generally nationalized means of production, but unlike the rest of the Trotskyist movement, Posadas went further, declaring other Regimes (such as &quot;Syria, Egypt, Iraq, Mali, Guinea, Congo Brazzaville etc.&quot;) - sometimes with, sometimes without clarifying adjectives - to be &quot;workers&#x27; states&quot;.

The justifications for these classifications as well as the explanations for the supposed progressive role of these regimes were compiled into Posadas&#x27; 1969 book &quot;The Revolutionary State&quot;.

==Cuba==

The Posadist group in Cuba, the Revolutionary Workers&#x27; Party (Trotskyist) or POR(T), gained importance due to the Cuban Revolution, in which it had a minor role. Posadist guerrillas fought alongside Fidel Castro and Che Guevara in 1959. When the Posadists split from the Fourth International in 1962, they took the Cuban section with them, leaving no other Trotskyist group represented in Cuba in the 1960s.

In 1961 the POR(T) argued that the Cuban government should forcibly expel the American military base at Guantanamo Bay. According to state media, the Posadists organised workers in the town of Guantanamo to march on the nearby military base. The POR(T) denied the allegation, but it was repeated by the Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party in the US, which was pro-Castro and denounced the Posadists as ultra-left. Cuban officials affiliated with the Popular Socialist Party, then raided the headquarters of the Posadist group and smashed its printing press, which was in the process of printing an edition of Trotsky&#x27;s &quot;The Permanent Revolution&quot; (1930).

Guevara, when asked in an interview about this event, commented:

:&quot;That did happen. It was an error. It was an error committed by an official of second rank. They smashed the plates. It should not have been done. However, we consider the Trotskyist party to be acting against the revolution. For example, they were taking the line that the Revolutionary Government is petty bourgeois, and were calling on the proletariat to exert pressure on the government and even to carry out another revolution in which the proletariat would come to power. This was prejudicing the discipline necessary at this stage.&quot;

The Cuban Posadist section became increasingly militant and was banned by the government; Castro denounced them as &quot;pestilential&quot; at the Tricontinental Conference held in January 1966. Cuban Posadists went on to claim that Castro had Guevara killed when, it turned out, he was actually in Bolivia fighting with the guerrilla movement there. Conversely, after Guevara was executed by Bolivian authorities, Posadas claimed in 1967 that it was unclear how Che Guevara was killed.

== Extraterrestrial life ==
Beginning in 1968, Posadas also became known for his theories concerning UFOs and extraterrestrial life. If anything like UFOs existed, they could demonstrate the existence of agents able to master a very sophisticated technology, something that would be compatible with what in this planet was advocated by socialism. If UFOs existed, they could be allied in addressing some of the major problems in the earth.

One of his most well-known works is a 1968 pamphlet called &quot;Les Soucoupes Volantes, le processus de la matiere et de l&#x27;energie, la science et le socialisme&quot; (&quot;Flying Saucers, the process of matter and energy, science and socialism&quot;). Here, he connects the existence of extraterrestrial life and UFOs to communism. He argues that the UFOs being spotted at that time indicates the advancements of life in other planets and that can be only possible due to communist ideologies. He also writes that capitalism tends to make people self-centered and focus on profits, rather than work on the scientific and civilizational progress of mankind. Since extraterrestrial beings have developed technology advanced enough to visit other planets, this indicates that they have surpassed the bane of a capitalistic society. Along with that, they have also surpassed their impulsion—the need to kill or control to assert dominance. Posadas shows enthusiasm to collaborate with extraterrestrial beings. He writes, &quot;We must appeal to the beings on other planets, when they come here, to intervene and collaborate with Earth&#x27;s inhabitants in suppressing poverty.&quot; With his argument, Posadas defines communism as a civilizational progress rather than an alternative political system. Although this is a single work of Posadas on extraterrestrial life, this idea has gained much popularity among his followers and later Trotskyists.

Posadas remarks that aliens “have no aggressive impulse, they have no need to kill in order to live: they come only to observe. We can foresee the existence of such beings, even taking into account the fantasies that exist among the reports, stories, observations, and statements&quot;

==&quot;Long live Posadas!&quot;==
Posadist newspapers such as &quot;Red Flag&quot;, published by the Revolutionary Workers Party (Trotskyist) in Britain, ran headlines praising Soviet cosmonauts and the launching of Chinese rockets as well as articles on local industrial disputes.

Posadas was also thought to have a large ego as indicated by his habit of ending his articles by exclaiming &quot;Long live Posadas!&quot;

This actually stemmed from the way Posadas &quot;wrote&quot; his documents. They were usually the transcript of speeches delivered at party events, whether with a small group of closest collaborators, or larger activities. In the early years, after Posadas ended his speeches with &quot;&quot;¡Viva la Revolución Mundial!&quot; and &quot;¡Viva la Cuarta Internacional!&quot; (“Long live world revolution! Long live the Fourth International!”), someone else would traditionally yell &quot;¡Viva el camarada Posadas!&quot;&quot; (“Long live comrade Posadas!”)– all this would be duly reported in print. 

== Scholarly discourse on Posadism ==
Due to the radical nature of the Posadist theories and the egocentric administration of the Fourth International Posadist, there were many backlashes against it soon after its foundation. Joan Benevant, an Argentine militant, compared the organization to a church where Posadas acted as “the pope”. Several member nations quit, the prominent ones being Brazil and Argentina. With the loss of several members and lack of support from scholars, Posadas continued to practice his principles nonetheless. Many scholars during at that time viewed his work in a satirical way, as seen in Teresa Hayter’s autobiography &quot;Hayter of the bourgeoisie,&quot; where she describes Posadas as “the craziest of all deviators from Trotskyism.” A very recent work on Posadism was done by A. M. Gittlitz called &quot;I Want to Believe: Posadism, UFOs and Apocalypse Communism&quot;. The author reviews the history of Posadism and its ultimate collapse, and analyzes the significance of the current rise of interest on this topic. Taking the theme of approaching Posadism as a “crazy subfield” of Trotskyism like earlier scholars, Gittlitz expands on it by exploring the current thoughts on Posadism, how that has changed from its previous cult-like nature in the late 20th century.

<text>Michael Spindler (22 December 1942 – September 5, 2016) was a German businessman who was president and CEO of Apple from 1993 to 1996. Spindler was born in Berlin.

==Personal life==
From 1985 until his death in 2016, Spindler lived between Paris, France, and San Francisco, California, United States, with his wife Maryse and three kids Karen, Laurie, and John.

==Career==
Spindler graduated from engineering at Technical University in Cologne in 1964 and worked at DEC and Intel, before he moved to join Apple Computer. Having joined Apple in 1980 after Mike Markkula brought him over to help out with Apple&#x27;s European office; he rose through the ranks in Apple&#x27;s European operations as President of Apple Europe, then President of Apple International. Michael Spindler had built a reputation as a great strategist in business tactics. One of his most successful strategies that soared Apple&#x27;s global sales included giving Apple&#x27;s various territories more autonomy over their marketing strategies. In January 1990, then CEO of Apple, John Sculley, appointed Spindler to be Apple&#x27;s chief operating officer. He was nicknamed &quot;The Diesel&quot; due to his strong work ethic.

On October 15, 1993, Spindler was chosen to take over as Apple&#x27;s CEO when John Sculley was ousted by Apple&#x27;s board of directors. Spindler presided over several successful projects, such as the introduction of the PowerPC, as well as some major failures, including the Newton and the Copland operating system. Spindler shied away from the spotlight preferring instead to work on operational management and strategy without fanfare. After Spindler became CEO, he did not make a public appearance for four months. One of his first moves as CEO included massive cost cutting measures such as laying off workers, ending costly projects and cutting down on R&amp;D projects, freezing executive salaries. During his tenure the Apple board authorized merger discussions with IBM, Sun Microsystems and Philips, but when these went nowhere, he was replaced by Gil Amelio on February 2, 1996.

==Death==
Spindler died after a short illness on September 5, 2016. His longtime friend and business partner Jean-Louis Gassée stated, &quot;Mike was an original, highly cultured mind, with high-level geopolitical views of our industry.&quot;

<doc id="422903" wikidata="Q65934748" url="?curid=422903" title="New North Road, Islington">
<text>The New North Road is a road in northern central London, forming part of a link road from the A1 at Highbury into the City of London at Moorgate. It is in length and is part of the A1200. This link road consists of Canonbury Road and New North Road, before several smaller sections to the south leading into the city.

This part of the link begins at the Essex Road crossroads in the London Borough of Islington: Canonbury Road enters from the north-west, whilst New North Road continues in a south-easterly direction. It continues south-east and crosses into the London Borough of Hackney, passing to the west of Shoreditch Park. It bears to the south, and ends at a junction with Pitfield Street. A link road continues shortly before the end of New North Road, becoming East Road for a short distance, before meeting up with City Road near Moorfields Eye Hospital and Old Street station.

==History==
New North Road was built to provide a new route northwards from Old Street to Highbury, as outlined in a Local Act of parliament 52 Geo. 3. c. cliv (1812): &quot;An Act for making a Public Carriage Road from the present Turnpike Road, near the South End of &quot;Highbury Place&quot;, &quot;Islington&quot; to &quot;Haberdashers Walk&quot;, in the Parish of &quot;Saint Leonard&quot;, &quot;Shoreditch&quot;, in the County of &quot;Middlesex&quot;.

The road was completed in 1822 as one of several roads built to connect with the Great North Road. This was during a period of land development in south-east Islington. It was paid for by tolls which were abolished in 1864.

==Buildings==

* Rydon Arms, 225 New North Road, (formerly 2 Russell Place, New North Road) London N1 7BG. No longer a public house this is a Grade II Listed Building. It is on the junction with Arlington Avenue and was part of a development by Henry Rydon.

<doc id="422904" wikidata="Q1946861" url="?curid=422904" title="Moorfields Eye Hospital">
<text>Moorfields Eye Hospital is a specialist National Health Service (NHS) eye hospital in Finsbury in the London Borough of Islington in London, England run by Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. Together with the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, which is adjacent to the hospital, it is the oldest and largest centre for ophthalmic treatment, teaching and research in Europe.

==History==
Moorfields Eye Hospital was founded at Charterhouse Square in 1805 as the London Dispensary for curing diseases of the Eye and Ear, by John Cunningham Saunders, assisted by John Richard Farre. It moved to a site on the former Moorfields in 1822, before moving to its present site in 1899, and became part of the National Health Service in 1948. These anniversaries gave it the unique ability to celebrate a centenary in 1999 and a bicentenary in 2005.

The new Richard Desmond Children&#x27;s Eye Centre (RDCEC), was endowed by the publisher, Richard Desmond, and was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in February 2007. Its location is adjacent to the hospital&#x27;s main City Road building.

In December 2021, it was announced that the Moorfields building on City Road and adjacent building &quot;Kemp House&quot; had been sold to private developers, and that the hospital would relocate to a new facility near King&#x27;s Cross railway station at the St Pancras Hospital site in Camden 

==Teaching and research==
Moorfields Eye Hospital is a major centre for postgraduate training of ophthalmologists, orthoptists, optometrists, and nurses. It has also played a pivotal role in ophthalmic research. Sir Stewart Duke-Elder founded the Institute of Ophthalmology, formerly the Central London Ophthalmic Hospital in Gray&#x27;s Inn Road and (now an integral part of University College London), and Sir Harold Ridley, Charles Schepens, and Norman Ashton have carried out research at Moorfields and the Institute.

==Fundraising and associated charities==
Founded in 1963, The Friends of Moorfields Charity is an independent registered charity, raising funds for the benefit of the patients of Moorfields Eye Hospital. The primary aim of this charity is to provide supplementary services and equipment for the comfort and well-being of Moorfields&#x27; patients and their visitors. It contributes towards buying much needed technical items for professional use in the hospital&#x27;s clinics, satellite centres, operating theatres and research laboratories. The charity also promotes and manages a wide range of volunteers, supporting the work and service of the hospital.
Moorfields Eye Charity is an independent registered charity for Moorfields Eye Hospital. Moorfields Eye Charity raises funds, above and beyond those normally provided by the NHS, to support and promote the work and research of Moorfields Eye Hospital, for the benefit of patients and staff, by raising extra funds to enhance services, research, equipment and facilities including a major joint – Moorfields and Institute of Ophthalmology, UCL – new building project.
The Special Trustees of Moorfields Eye Hospital (charity number 228064) is a grant-giving body, which primarily supports research carried out at the hospital and research partners at the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, alongside a range of other projects.

<doc id="422907" wikidata="Q1319224" url="?curid=422907" title="JALways">
<text>, formerly , was an international airline registered in Shinagawa, Tokyo, Japan, with its headquarters and its main hub at Narita International Airport. The airline had a secondary hub at Osaka&#x27;s Kansai International Airport. Its operations included scheduled and non-scheduled international passenger services to 15 high-density low yield tourist destinations in nine countries using a fleet of Boeing only aircraft wet-leased from Japan Airlines.

JALways was founded as Japan Air Charter on October 5, 1990 and began charter operations with a McDonnell Douglas DC-10 on February 22, 1991. The airline obtained a license to operate scheduled services on July 30, 1999 and operated its first scheduled passenger service on October 1. On the same day, the airline changed its name to JALways. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 1999, JALways, together with its sister airlines within the JAL Group, carried over 32 million passengers and over 1.1 million tons of cargo and mail.

JALways was once a wholly owned subsidiary of Japan&#x27;s flag carrier, Japan Airlines, but on December 1, 2010 its operations were merged into those of its parent company.

== History ==

The airline was established on October 5, 1990, as Japan Air Charter Co., Ltd. (JAZ), an 80 percent-owned low-cost charter subsidiary of Japan Airlines (JAL), to operate leisure flights to Asia-Pacific resort destinations from regional airports in Japan; in response to a Ministry of Transport policy. JAZ obtained its aircraft from JAL; its cockpit crews were American contract pilots based in Hawaii and its cabin crews were hired and based in Bangkok, where it operates a cabin crew training centre. JAZ obtained license to operate non-scheduled services on February 22, 1991 and operated its first charter flight from Fukuoka to Honolulu with a McDonnell Douglas DC-10 on July 1. The airline celebrated its 100,000th passenger on July 9, 1993, in a ceremony held in Sendai.

During the 1990s, JAL was hit by the effects of Japan&#x27;s recession, increased foreign competition and the strengthening of the Japanese Yen, JAZ was given a new role to help reduce costs. The airline obtained the license to operate scheduled services on July 30, 1999 and would operate as a scheduled carrier on a wet-lease basis for JAL. It would operate on high-density low yield tourist routes in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly the Japan–Hawaii services; with a fleet of four McDonnell Douglas DC-10s and five Boeing 747s. On October 1, the airline changed its name to JALways Co., Ltd. and operated its first scheduled passenger service from Tokyo to Kona and Honolulu.

JALways became a wholly owned subsidiary of Japan Airlines on March 9, 2001 through an exchange of shares. The change in ownership enabled JAL to consolidate and improve management and operational efficiency in the JAL Group&#x27;s international passenger operations, part of the JAL Medium Term Corporate Plan 2000-2002. The airline introduced new uniforms for its cabin crew on April 1, 2005, and retired its last McDonnell Douglas DC-10 on October 31. JALways became an affiliate member of Oneworld on April 1, 2007, together with four of its sister airlines, in the alliance&#x27;s biggest expansion in its young history.

As part of the JAL Medium Term Corporate Plan for 2005–2007, announced on March 10, 2005, the JAL Group accelerated the retirement of older Boeing 747 aircraft. The airline operated its last Boeing 747-300 &quot;Classic Jumbo Jet&quot; as JALways Flight 73 from Honolulu to Tokyo on July 30, 2009; after 26 years of service to the airline group. The aircraft was draped in a giant Hawaiian lei before departure at Honolulu International Airport; and the day was declared as &quot;Japan Airlines Classic Jumbo Jet Day&quot; by the State of Hawaii Governor Linda Lingle and Lt. Governor Duke Aiona The aircraft was met on arrival in Tokyo by the &quot;Father of the 747&quot;, Mr Joseph F. &quot;Joe&quot; Sutter. A sell-out commemorative flight flew fans of the Boeing 747-300 &quot;Classic Jumbo Jet&quot; from Tokyo (Haneda) to Shimojishima on a round-trip day tour on July 5, 2009.

In May 2009, it was reported that the airline terminated the assignments of 130 American contract Hawaii-based Boeing 747 pilots and closed its Oahu office. Japan-based JAL cockpit crew now operates the five daily flights previously operated by the JALways crew.

== Corporate affairs ==
Prior to closing, its headquarters were on the third floor of the at Narita International Airport in Narita, Chiba Prefecture and its main hub at Narita International Airport.

Previously its headquarters were on the 23rd floor of the Spheretower Tennoz (スフィアタワー天王洲 &quot;Sufiatawā Tennōzu&quot;) in Higashi-Shinagawa, Shinagawa, Tokyo.

== Destinations ==
Until November 30, 2010, JALways operated scheduled services to 12 international and 3 domestic destinations in 9 countries in 3 continents.

== Fleet ==

JALways operated a fleet of Boeing 747-400, Boeing 767 and Boeing 777-200 aircraft, wet-leased from its parent, Japan Airlines.

=== Fleet history ===
Aircraft that has been in service with JALways are (in alphabetical order):
* Boeing 747-100 (JA8128)
* Boeing 747-200
* Boeing 747-300/SR
* McDonnell Douglas DC-10

== JAL Mileage Bank ==
JAL Mileage Bank (JMB) is the travel rewards program of JAL Group, including Japan Airlines, JALways, JAL Express, Japan Transocean Air, Japan Air Commuter, Hokkaido Air System and Ryukyu Air Commuter.

== Incidents and accidents ==
On August 12, 2005, JALways Flight 58 operated by a McDonnell Douglas DC-10 from Fukuoka to Honolulu experienced left-wing engine trouble shortly after takeoff. The aircraft immediately returned to Fukuoka Airport. Some engine parts fell on the Sharyo district of Fukuoka and several people were slightly injured and parked car windscreens damaged.

<doc id="422909" wikidata="Q423782" url="?curid=422909" title="James's flamingo">
<text>James&#x27;s flamingo (Phoenicoparrus jamesi), also known as the puna flamingo, is a species of flamingo that lives at high altitudes in the Andean plateaus of Peru, Chile, Bolivia, and northwest Argentina.

It is named for Harry Berkeley James, a British naturalist who studied the bird. James&#x27;s flamingo is closely related to the Andean flamingo, and the two species are the only members of the genus &quot;Phoenicoparrus&quot;. The Chilean flamingo, Andean flamingo, and James&#x27;s flamingo are all sympatric, and all live in colonies (including shared nesting areas). James&#x27;s flamingo had been thought to be extinct until a population was discovered in a remote area in 1956.

== Description ==

The James&#x27;s flamingo is smaller than the Andean flamingo, and is about the same size as the Old World species, the lesser flamingo. A specimen of the bird was first collected by Charles Rahmer, who was on a collecting expedition sponsored by Harry Berkeley James, (1846–1892, a manager of a Chilean saltpetre mine born in Walsall, England) after whom the bird was named. It typically measures about long and weighs about . James&#x27;s flamingos have a very long neck made up of 19 long cervical vertebrae, allowing for a large range of movement and rotation of the head. They are also distinctive for their long, thin legs. The knee is not externally visible: it is located at the top of the leg. The joint at the middle of the leg, which may be mistaken for the knee joint, is actually the ankle joint. Its plumage is very pale pink, with bright carmine streaks around the neck and on the back. When it is perched, a small amount of black can be seen in its wings; these are the &quot;flight feathers&quot;. They have bright red skin around their eyes, which in adults are yellow. Their legs are brick red and their bills are bright yellow with a black tip. 

The James&#x27;s flamingo is similar to most of the flamingo species in South America, but the Chilean flamingo is pinker, with a longer bill (which is not yellow), and the Andean flamingo is larger, with more black in the wings and bill, and with yellow legs. The easiest way to distinguish James&#x27;s flamingos is by their lighter-colored feathers and the bright yellow on their bills. A good method to distinguish the two &quot;Phoenicoparrus&quot; flamingo species from other flamingo species is to look at their feet. The two &quot;Phoenicoparrus&quot; species have three toes but no hallux. The feet of the other three species of flamingos have three forward-facing toes and a hallux.

=== Feathers ===
Newly hatched flamingos are gray or white. Their feathers acquire a pink color by the time they are around 2 or 3 years old, due to their carotene-rich diet. The chemicals that color their feathers are the terpenoids: alpha- and beta-carotenes (similar to carotene in carrots). An adult has 12 major feathers designed for flight on each wing. The body is covered in contour feathers, which protect the bird and also help with waterproofing (due to a secretion of oil at the base of the feathers). When the birds are roosting, they face into the wind so that the rain will not blow upwards and soak the underside of their feathers. 

Their plumage is pale pink, with bright carmine streaks around their necks and on their backs. When they are perching, a small amount of black can be seen in the wings; these are the flight feathers mentioned above. There are typically 12 to 16 tail feathers. James&#x27;s flamingos molt their wing- and body feathers according to their breeding schedule and the color of the new feathers depends on the nature of their diet. There is no difference in color between males and females.

=== Flight ===
All flamingo species are capable of flying. The flight feathers are easily distinguished in James&#x27;s flamingos as they are the only black feathers on the bird. To begin flying, they run a few steps and then begin to flap their wings. When they want to land, they repeat this process in reverse, and as they touch down to a surface, they continue to run as they decelerate and stop flapping their wings. When migrating in a flock, flamingos have been observed to fly at speeds of up to . But they may not reach this speed when traveling shorter distances.

== Ecology ==

=== Feeding ===

Both James&#x27;s and Andean flamingos feed their chicks through an esophageal secretion that is regurgitated from the crop of the bird. The difference between the two species lies in the composition of the prolactin secretion produced by each bird. Both male and female parents are able to feed the chick. Adult flamingos are the most developed filter feeders of the birds. Of the species, James&#x27;s flamingo has the finest filter-feeding apparatus. The flamingo feeds on diatoms and other microscopic algae. The shape of the bill is deeply keeled. To feed, the flamingos&#x27; long legs allow them to walk into the water and swoop their necks down into an S-shape to allow the beak to enter the water. The S-shape is effective because it allows the head to be placed upright and the bottom of the bill to be placed as shallow or as deep as it pleases. Only lowering the distal end of the bill into the water allows nostrils to remain above water. The water filled with small organisms floods the bill and filtration process begins. The lakes, from which the flamingo typically feeds, are Andean lakes which are mostly fresh water, but if salt water is encountered, the flamingos have salt glands in their nostrils where excess salt is secreted. 

The filtering process starts with the tongue, which is very soft and fleshy with channel-like features that direct the food and water to the filtering apparatus. The bill of James&#x27;s flamingo is the narrowest of its kind. Both the Andean and James&#x27;s flamingos have deep-keeled bills where the upper jaw is narrower than the lower. The gape of the bill is therefore on the dorsal side of the bill. The bill of James&#x27;s flamingo is smaller and has a narrower upper jaw. The proximal end of the bill is mostly horizontal, then has a curvature downward and the distal end finishes with a hook-like feature. The inner morphology of the beak is similar to that of the lesser flamingo, where the upper and lower jaws contain lamellae which filter the food. In both the upper and lower jaw, the proximal portion of the bill contains lamellae that are ridge-like with a curvature and distal end become more like hooks. Marginal and submarginal lamellae are found, and James&#x27;s flamingo has the greatest number of both, which also means a smaller intermarginal distance is seen between them. About 21 lamellae per cm are found in this species, which is more than twice the number found in other flamingos. When the upper and lower jaws close together, the lamellae mesh together to allow the bill to be closed fully. The sizes of the diatoms associated with this size filtering apparatus are about 21–60 μm. Diatoms this size are typically found close to the edge of the water; even in colonies of multiple species, James&#x27;s flamingos typically feed in the region closest to the edge of the water. The birds are able to use their webbed feet to help kick up microscopic algae if not enough are floating in the water column.

=== Breeding ===

Breeding cycles in flamingos begin at 6 years of age when fully matured. The frequency of breeding is irregular and may skip a year. The entire colony may participate in mating rituals at the same time. The males put on a show by vocalizing and sticking their necks and heads straight up in the air and turning their heads back and forth. The females initiate mating by walking away from the group and a male follows. The female then spreads her wings and the male mounts the female. The female lays one egg on a cone-shaped nest made from mud, sticks, and other materials in the area. The shape of the egg is oval, similar to that of a chicken. It is smaller in size (length and breadth) compared to the other species, including the closely related Andean flamingo. 

Both the male and female incubate the egg for 26–31 days before it hatches. The chick breaks through the shell using an egg tooth, which is not actually a true tooth, but is actually a keratinized structure, which falls off after fully hatching. When newly hatched, the chick&#x27;s bill is straight and red, but later develops a curve and the adult colors of beak. The feathers are white and grey and the legs are pink. The eyes of chicks are gray for their first year. The parents are able to distinguish their chick from others in the colony by appearance and vocalization.

== Conservation status ==

This species was determined to be near threatened by the IUCN in 2008, because the populations of the last three generations of this species have declined.

The greatest threat to the population of this species is human destruction of their habitat. In local culture, stealing the eggs from the nest and sell them was common practice, but since then, measures have been taken to control this. Environmental threats such as heavy rainfall may also have an effect on the breeding of the species. Threats the productivity of the diatoms also threaten the species if enough food is available for them to eat.
