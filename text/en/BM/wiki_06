<text>Courtship is the period wherein some couples get to know each other prior to a possible marriage or committed romantic, &quot;de facto&quot; relationship. Courtship traditionally may begin after a betrothal and may conclude with the celebration of marriage. A courtship may be an informal and private matter between two people or may be a public affair, or a formal arrangement with family approval. Traditionally, in the case of a formal engagement, it is the role of a male to actively &quot;court&quot; or &quot;woo&quot; a female, thus encouraging her to understand him and her receptiveness to a marriage proposal.

Courtship as a social practice is a relatively recent phenomenon, emerging only within the last few centuries. From the standpoint of anthropology and sociology, courtship is linked with other institutions such as marriage and the family which have changed rapidly, having been subject to the effects of advances in technology and medicine. 

In non-human animals, &quot;courtship&quot; refers to sexual behavior that precedes copulation. 

== History ==
In the past, marriages in most societies were arranged by parents and older relatives with the goal not being love but legacy and &quot;economic stability and political alliances&quot;, according to anthropologists. Accordingly, there was little need for a temporary trial period such as courtship before a permanent community-recognized union was formed between a man and a woman. While pair-bonds of varying forms were recognized by most societies as acceptable social arrangements, marriage was reserved for heterosexual pairings and had a transactional nature, where wives were in many cases a form of property being exchanged between father and husband, and who would have to serve the function of reproduction. Communities exerted pressure on people to form pair-bonds in places such as Europe; in China, society &quot;demanded people get married before having a sexual relationship&quot; and many societies found that some formally recognized bond between a man and a woman was the best way of rearing and educating children as well as helping to avoid conflicts and misunderstandings regarding competition for mates.
Generally, during much of recorded history of humans in civilization, and into the Middle Ages in Europe, marriages were seen as business arrangements between families, while romance was something that happened outside of marriage discreetly, such as covert meetings. The 12th-century book &quot;The Art of Courtly Love&quot; advised that &quot;True love can have no place between husband and wife&quot;. According to one view, clandestine meetings between men and women, generally outside of marriage or before marriage, were the precursors to today&#x27;s courtship.

From about 1700 a worldwide movement perhaps described as the &quot;empowerment of the individual&quot; took hold, leading towards greater emancipation of women and equality of individuals. Men and women became more equal politically, financially, and socially in many nations. In the early 20th centuries, women gradually won the right to vote starting in the first sovereign nation Norway in 1913, and to own property and receive equal treatment by the law, and these changes had profound impacts on the relationships between men and women and parental influence declined. In many societies, individuals could decide—on their own—whether they should marry, whom they should marry, and when they should marry in a &quot;courtship ritual where young women entertained gentleman callers, usually in the home, under the watchful eye of a chaperone&quot;, but increasingly, in many Western countries, it became a self-initiated activity with two young people going out as a couple in public together. Still, courtship varies considerably by nation, custom, religious upbringing, technology, and social class, and important exceptions with regards to individual freedoms remain as many countries today still practice arranged marriages, request dowries, and forbid same-sex pairings. Although in many countries, movies, meals, and meeting in coffeehouses and other places is now popular, as are advice books suggesting various strategies for men and women, in other parts of the world, such as in South Asia and many parts of the Middle East, being alone in public as a couple is not only frowned upon but can even lead to either person being socially ostracized.

The 1849 book &quot;The Whole Art of Polite Courtship; Or the Ladies &amp; Gentlemen&#x27;s Love Letter Writer&quot; exemplifies the importance of love letters in 19th century courtship with a goal of marriage. The book contains 31 love letter samples for men and women in different careers, presumably for readers to draw inspiration when writing their own romantic correspondences. Etiquette books, such as the 1852 &quot;Etiquette of Courtship and Matrimony,&quot; detail socially appropriate ways to meet lovers, court, arrange a wedding, honeymoon, and avoid arguments.

In the twentieth century, courtship was sometimes seen as a precursor to marriage but it could also be considered as an end-in-itself, that is, an informal social activity akin to friendship. It generally happened in that portion of a person&#x27;s life before the age of marriage, but as marriage became less permanent with the advent of divorce, courtship could happen at other times in peoples lives as well. People became more mobile. Rapidly developing technology played a huge role: new communication technology such as the telephone, Internet and text messaging enabled rendezvous to be arranged without face-to-face contact. Cars extended the range of courtship as well as enabled back-seat sexual exploration.

In the mid-twentieth century, the advent of birth control as well as safer procedures for abortion changed the equation considerably, and there was less pressure to marry as a means for satisfying sexual urges. New types of relationships formed; it was possible for people to live together without marrying and without children. Information about human sexuality grew, and with it an acceptance of all types of consensual sexual orientations is becoming more common. Today, the institution of courtship continues to evolve at a rapid rate with new possibilities and choices opening up particularly through online courtship.

Humans have been compared to other species in terms of sexual behavior. Neurobiologist Robert Sapolsky constructed a reproductive spectrum with opposite poles being tournament species, in which males compete fiercely for reproductive privileges with females, and pair bond arrangements, in which a male and female will bond for life. According to Sapolsky, humans are somewhat in the middle of this spectrum, in the sense that humans form pair bonds, but there is the possibility of cheating or changing partners. These species-particular behavior patterns provide a context for aspects of human reproduction, including courtship. However, one particularity of the human species is that pair bonds are often formed without necessarily having the intention of reproduction. In modern times, emphasis on the institution of marriage, traditionally described as a male-female bond, has obscured pair bonds formed by same-sex and transgender couples, and that many heterosexual couples also bond for life without offspring, or that often pairs that do have offspring separate. Thus, the concept of marriage is changing widely in many countries.

== Duration ==

The average duration of courtship varies considerably throughout the world. Furthermore, there is vast individual variation between couples. Courtship may be completely omitted, as in cases of some arranged marriages where the couple do not meet before the wedding.

In the United Kingdom, a poll of 3,000 engaged or married couples resulted in an average duration between first meeting and accepted proposal of marriage of 2 years and 11 months, with the women feeling ready to accept at an average of 2 years and 7 months. Regarding duration between proposal and wedding, the UK poll above gave an average of 2 years and 3 months.

== Traditions ==
Fairly casual in most European-influenced cultures, in some traditional societies, courtship is a highly structured activity with very specific formal rules.

In some societies, the parents or community propose potential partners and then allow limited courtship to determine whether the parties are suited. In Japan, there is such a type of courtship called Omiai, with similar practices called &quot;Xiangqin&quot; () in the Greater China Area. Parents will hire a matchmaker to provide pictures and résumés of potential mates, and if the couple agrees, there will be a formal meeting with the matchmaker and often parents in attendance. The matchmaker and parents will often exert pressure on the couple to decide whether they want to marry after a few meetings.

Courtship in the Philippines is one complex form of courtship. Unlike other societies, it takes a far more subdued and indirect approach. Its complexity involves stages, and it is considered normal for courtship to last a year or longer. It is common to see a man showing off by sending love letters and love poems, singing romantic songs, and buying gifts for a woman. The parents are also seen as part of the courtship practice, as their approval is commonly needed before courtship may begin or before the woman gives the man an answer to his advances.

In more closed societies, courtship is virtually eliminated by the practice of arranged marriages in which partners are chosen for young people, typically by their parents. Forbidding experimental and serial courtship and sanctioning only arranged matches is partly a means of guarding the chastity of young people and partly a matter of furthering family interests, which, in such cultures, may be considered more important than individual romantic preferences.

Throughout history, courtship has often included traditions such as exchanging valentines, written correspondence (facilitated by the creation of the postal service in the nineteenth century), and similar communication-based courting. Over recent decades, though, the concept of arranged marriage has changed or simply been mixed with other forms of courtship, including Eastern and Indian ones. Potential couples have the opportunity to meet and socialise with each other before deciding whether to continue the relationship.

==Courtship in social theory==
Courtship is used by a number of theorists to explain gendering processes and sexual identity. Scientific research into courtship began in the 1980s, after which time academic researchers started to generate theories about modern courtship practices and norms. Researchers have found that, contrary to popular beliefs, courtship is normally triggered and controlled by women, driven mainly by non-verbal behaviours, to which men respond. One of the functions of romantic love is courtship.

This is generally supported by other theorists who specialise in the study of body language. There are some feminist scholars, however, who regard courtship as a socially constructed (and male-led) process organised to subjugate women. Farrell reports, for example, that magazines about marriage and romantic fiction continue to attract a 98% female readership. Systematic research into courtship processes inside the workplace as well as two ten-year studies examining norms in different international settings continue to support a view that courtship is a social process that socialises &quot;both&quot; sexes into accepting forms of relationship that maximise the chances of successfully raising children.

===Commercial courtship services===
As technology has progressed, so too have the methods of courtship. In online courtship, individuals create profiles where they disclose personal information, photographs, hobbies, interests, religion and expectations. Then the user can search through hundreds of thousands of accounts and connect with multiple people at once which in return, gives the user more options and more opportunity to find what meets their standards. Online courtship has influenced the idea of choice. In &quot;Modern Romance: An Investigation&quot;, Aziz Ansari states that one third of marriages in the United States between 2005 and 2012 met through online courtship services.

Today there are hundreds of sites to choose from and websites designed to fit specific needs such as Match, eHarmony, OkCupid, Zoosk, and ChristianMingle. Mobile apps, such as Grindr and Tinder allow users to upload profiles that are then judged by others on the service; one can either swipe right on a profile (indicating interest) or swipe left (which presents another possible mate).

=== Technology ===

The Internet is shaping the way new generations meet; Facebook, Skype, WhatsApp, and other applications have made remote connections possible.

Online courtship tools are an alternate way to meet potential mates. Many people use smartphone apps such as Tinder, Grindr, or Bumble which allow a user to accept or reject another user with a single swipe of a finger. Some critics have suggested that matchmaking algorithms are imperfect and are &quot;no better than chance&quot; for the task of identifying acceptable partners. Others have suggested that the speed and availability of emerging technologies may be undermining the possibility for couples to have long-term meaningful relationships when finding a replacement partner has potentially become too easy.

== Worldwide ==

Courtship customs and habits vary considerably throughout the world. The average duration of courtship before proceeding to engagement or marriage varies considerably throughout the world.

=== Africa ===

==== Ethiopia ====
According to one source, there are four ways that marriage can happen among the Nyangatom people: (1) arranged marriage, when well-respected elders are sent to the girl&#x27;s family on behalf of the boy&#x27;s family; (2) courtship after a friendly meeting between boy and girl such as at a market place or holiday where there&#x27;s dancing; (3) abduction, such as during a blood feud between families; (4) inheritance.

==== North Africa ====
In North Africa like in many parts of the Middle East, sex without marriage is considered unacceptable. Courtship in North Africa is predominantly done under family supervision, usually in a public place.

=== Asia ===
Asia is a mix of traditional approaches with involvement by parents and extended families such as arranged marriages as well as modern courtship. In many cultural traditions, including some in South Asia, and the Middle East and to some extent East Asia, as in the case of Omiai in Japan and the similar &quot;Xiangqin&quot; (相親) practiced in the Greater China Area, a date may be arranged by a third party, who may be a family member, acquaintance, or professional matchmaker.

==== China ====

Patterns of courtship are changing in China, with increased modernization bumping into traditional ways.

A 2003 report in &quot;China Daily&quot; suggested that courtship for most Chinese university women was &quot;difficult&quot;, required work, stole time away from academic advancement, and placed women in a precarious position of having to balance personal success against traditional Chinese relationships. Many women were reported to have high standards for men they sought, but also worried that their academic credentials could &quot;scare away more traditional Chinese men&quot;. It was reportedly difficult finding places to have privacy, since many dormitory rooms had eight or more pupils in one suite, while courtship in restaurants tended to be expensive. One student remarked: &quot;American couples drink and dance together. But in China, we study together.&quot;

Romantic love is more difficult during times of financial stress, and economic forces can encourage singles, particularly women, to select a partner primarily on financial considerations. Some men postpone marriage until their financial position is more secure and use wealth to help attract women. One trend is towards exclusive matchmaking events for the &#x27;rich and powerful&#x27;; for example, an annual June event in Wuhan with expensive entry-ticket prices for men (99,999 RMB) lets financially secure men choose so-called &quot;bikini brides&quot; based on their beauty and education, and the financial exclusivity of the event was criticized by the official news outlet &quot;China Daily&quot;. Surveys though from 2015 to 2018 suggest that the majority of Chinese respondents (especially college students) would place the character and personality of their partners above material assets, with also increasing acceptance towards evenly splitting bills or going Dutch.

There have been conflicting reports on expatriate courtship in China&#x27;s capital city. One account in 2006 suggested the courtship scene in Beijing to be &quot;sad&quot; with particular difficulties for foreign women hoping to find romance. It was reportedly due to the cold, uninterested, or unappealing attitudes of the male expats and the shyness and cultural differences of the Chinese men, and another account in 2010 documented similar, if slightly improved results. A different report in 2010, though, suggested that some Chinese men preferred Western women, viewing them as less girlish and materialistic, and also more independent and straightforward than Chinese women. A 2016 survey of Chinese students abroad, however, imply there have been significant barriers to foreign courtship, and the intermarriage rate of Chinese women in Shanghai has been decreasing.

A new format of Internet &quot;QQ&quot; chat rooms is gaining ground against so-called &quot;traditional courtship agencies&quot; in Changsha (Hunan Province); the QQ rooms have 20,000 members, and service is much less expensive than courtship agencies which can charge 100 to 200 yuan ($13 to US$26) per introduction. Internet courtship, with computer-assisted matchmaking, is becoming more prevalent; one site supposedly has 23 million registered users. Speed dating has come to Shanghai and other cities. Worldwide online matchmakers have explored entering the Chinese market via partnerships or acquisitions.

Each year, November 11 has become an unofficial holiday known as China&#x27;s Singles&#x27; Day when singles are encouraged to make an extra effort to find a partner. Worried parents of unmarried children often arrange dates for their offspring on this day as well as others. Before the day approaches, thousands of college students and young workers post messages describing their plans for this day. In Arabic numerals, the day looks like &quot;1111&quot;, that is, &quot;like four single people standing together&quot;, and there was speculation that it originated in the late 1990s when college students celebrated being single with &quot;a little self-mockery&quot; but a differing explanation dates it back to events in the Roman Empire. For many, Singles&#x27; Day offers people a way to &quot;demonstrate their stance on love and marriage&quot;. In 2005, a government-sponsored agency called Shanghai Women&#x27;s Activities Centre (Chinese: Jinguoyuan) organized periodic matchmaking events often attended by parents.

There has been concern that young people&#x27;s views of marriage have changed because of economic opportunities, with many choosing deliberately not to get married, as well as young marrieds who have decided not to have children, or to postpone having them. Cohabiting relationships are tolerated more often. Communities where people live but do not know each other well are becoming more common in China like elsewhere, leading to fewer opportunities to meet somebody locally without assistance. Divorce rates are rising in cities such as Shanghai, which recorded 27,376 divorces in 2004, an increase of 30% from 2003.

Relationships between students preparing for college are frowned upon by many parents in China. There was a report that sexual relations among middle schoolers in Guangzhou sometimes resulted in abortions. There have been reports of scams involving get-rich-quick schemes; a forty-year-old migrant worker was one of a thousand seduced by an advertisement which read &quot;Rich woman willing to pay 3 million yuan for sperm donor&quot; but the worker was cheated out of his savings of 190,000 yuan (US$27,500).

The game show &quot;If You Are the One&quot;, titled after Chinese personal ads, featured some provocative contestants making sexual allusions and the show reportedly ran afoul of authorities and had to change its approach. The two-host format involves a panel of 24 single women questioning a man to decide if he will remain on the show; if he survives, he can choose a girl to date; the show gained notoriety for controversial remarks and opinions such as model Ma Nuo saying she prefer to &quot;weep in a BMW than laugh on a bike&quot;, who was later banned from making appearances.

==== India ====
The custom of Indian arranged marriages requires little courtship, although there are strong indications that the institution is undergoing change, and that &quot;love marriages&quot; are becoming more accepted as India becomes more intertwined with the rest of the world. In the cities at least, it is becoming more accepted for two people to meet and try to find if there is compatibility.
The majority of Indian marriages are arranged by parents and relatives, and one estimate is that 7 of every 10 marriages are arranged. Sometimes the bride and groom do not meet until the wedding, and there is no courtship or wooing before the joining. In the past, it meant that couples were chosen from the same caste and religion and economic status. There is widespread support for arranged marriages generally. Writer Lavina Melwani described a happy marriage which had been arranged by the bride&#x27;s father, and noted that during the engagement, the woman was allowed to go out with him before they were married on only one occasion; the couple married and found happiness. Supporters of arranged marriage suggest that there is a risk of having the marriage fall apart whether it was arranged by relatives or by the couple themselves, and that what&#x27;s important is not how the marriage came to be but what the couple does after being married. Parents and relatives exert considerable influence, sometimes posting matrimonial ads in newspapers and online. Customs encourage families to put people together, and discourage sexual experimentation as well as so-called &quot;serial courtship&quot; in which a prospective bride or groom meets but continually rejects possible partners, since the interests of the family are seen as more important than the romantic needs of the people marrying. Indian writers, such as Mistry in his book &quot;Family Matters&quot;, sometimes depict arranged marriages as unhappy. Writer Sarita Sarvate of &quot;India Currents&quot; thinks people calculate their &quot;value&quot; on the &quot;Indian marriage market&quot; according to measures such as family status, and that arranged marriages typically united spouses who often did not love each other. She suggested &quot;love&quot; was out of place in this world because it risked passion and &quot;sordid&quot; sexual liaisons. Love, as she sees it, is &quot;Waking up in the morning and thinking about someone.&quot; Writer Jennifer Marshall described the wife in an arranged marriage as living in a world of solitude without much happiness, and feeling pressured by relatives to conceive a son so she would not be considered as &quot;barren&quot; by her husband&#x27;s family; in this sense, the arranged marriage did not bring &quot;love, happiness, and companionship&quot;. Writer Vijaysree Venkatraman believes arranged marriages are unlikely to disappear soon, commenting in his book review of Shoba Narayan&#x27;s &quot;Monsoon Diary&quot;, which has a detailed description of the steps involved in a present-day arranged marriage. There are indications that even the institution of arranged marriages is changing, with marriages increasingly being arranged by &quot;unknown, unfamiliar sources&quot; and less based on local families who know each other. Writer Lavina Melwani in &quot;Little India&quot; compared Indian marriages to business deals:

Relationships in which courtship is undertaken by two people without parental involvement and sometimes carry on clandestine get-togethers, has become increasingly common. When this leads to a wedding, the resulting unions are sometimes called &quot;love marriages&quot;. There are increasing instances when couples initiate contact on their own, particularly if they live in a foreign country; in one case, a couple met surreptitiously over a game of cards. Indians who move abroad to Britain or America often follow the cultural patterns of their new country: for example, one Indian woman met a white American man while skiing, and married him, and the formerly &quot;all-important relatives&quot; were reduced to bystanders trying to influence things ineffectively. Factors operating worldwide, such as increased affluence, the need for longer education, and greater mobility have lessened the appeal for arranged marriages, and these trends have affected criteria about which possible partners are acceptable, making it more likely that pairings will cross previously impenetrable barriers such as caste or ethnic background. Indian Americans in the U.S. sometimes participate in &quot;Singles Meets&quot; organized by websites which happen about once a month, with 100 participants at each event; an organizer did not have firm statistics about the success rate leading to a long-term relationship but estimated about one in every ten members finds a partner through the site.

Courtship websites are gaining ground in India. Writer Rupa Dev preferred websites which emphasized authenticity and screened people before entering their names into their databases, making it a safer environment overall, so that site users can have greater trust that it is safe to meet others on the site. Dev suggested that such websites were much better than the anonymous chatrooms of the 1990s.

During the interval before marriage, whether it is an arranged or a love marriage, private detectives have been hired to check up on a prospective bride or groom, or to verify claims about a potential spouse made in newspaper advertising, and there are reports that such snooping is increasing. Detectives investigate former amorous relationships and can include fellow college students, former police officers skilled in investigations, and medical workers &quot;with access to health records&quot;.

Transsexuals and eunuchs have begun using Internet services in some states in India.

The practice of courtship runs against some religious traditions, and one particular Hindu group Sri Ram Sena threatened to &quot;force unwed couples&quot; to marry, if they were discovered courtship on Valentine&#x27;s Day; a fundamentalist leader said &quot;drinking and dancing in bars and celebrating this day has nothing to do with Hindu traditions.&quot; The threat sparked a protest via the Internet which resulted in cartloads of pink panties being sent to the fundamentalist leader&#x27;s office. as part of the Pink Chaddi Campaign (Pink Underwear/Panties Campaign). Another group, Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha, threatened to do the same, for which it was severely mocked online and on the day after Valentine&#x27;s Day, had protesters outside its Delhi headquarters, with people (mockingly) complaining that it did not fulfill its &quot;promise&quot;, with some having come with materials for the wedding rituals.

In India, parents sometimes participate in websites designed to match couples, with some offering to organize double or group socialising.

==== Japan ====
There is a type of courtship called &quot;Omiai&quot; in which parents hire a matchmaker to give resumes and pictures to potential mates for their approval, leading to a formal meeting with parents and matchmaker attending. If the couple has a few rendezvous, they are often pressured by the matchmaker and parents to decide whether or not to marry.

==== Korea ====
The reasons for courtship in Korea are various. Research conducted by &quot;Saegye Daily&quot; showed that teenagers choose to keep company for reasons such as &quot;to become more mature&quot;, &quot;to gain consultation on worries, or troubles&quot;, or &quot;to learn the difference between boys and girls&quot;, etc. Similarly, a news report in &quot;MK Daily&quot; showed that the primary reasons for courtship for workers of around ages 20–30 are &quot;emotional stability&quot;, &quot;marriage&quot;, &quot;someone to spend time with&quot;, etc. An interesting feature in the reasons for courtship in Korea is that many Koreans are somewhat motivated to find a partner due to the societal pressure that often views single persons as incompetent.

Present Korean courtship shows a changing attitude due to the influence of tradition and modernization. There are a lot of Confucian ideas and practices that still saturate South Korean culture and daily life as traditional values. Patriarchy in Korea has been grounded on Confucian culture that postulated hierarchical social orders according to age and sex. Patriarchy is &quot;a system of social structure and practices in which men dominate, oppress and exploit women” which is well reflected in the ways of courtship in Korea. Adding to it, there is an old saying that says a boy and a girl should not sit together after they have reached the age of seven. It is one of the old teachings of Confucianism and reveals its inclination toward conservatism.

Most Koreans tend to regard courtship as a precursor to marriage. According to a survey conducted by Gyeonggi-do Family Women&#x27;s Researcher on people of age 26–44, 85.7% of respondents replied as ‘willing to get married’. The market for marriage agencies are growing continuously. DUO and Gayeon are one of the major marriage agencies in Korea. Also, &quot;Mat-sun&quot;, the blind date which is usually based on the premise of marriage, is held often among ages of late 20s to 30s. But the late trend is leaning towards the separation between courtship and marriage unlike the conservative ways of the past. In the survey conducted by a marriage agency, of 300 single males and females who were asked of their opinions on marrying their lovers, about only 42% of the males and 39% of the females said yes. There are also cases of courtship without the premise of marriage. However, the majority still takes getting into a relationship seriously.

Courtship in Korea is also considered a necessary activity supported by society. Korean adults are constantly questioned whether or not they are courting by the people around them. During family gatherings on holidays one of the questions that people hate getting asked the most is related to marriage. According to a survey it was the highest ranked at 47.3 percent.

College students in their sophomore to junior year who have not been in a relationship feel anxious that they are falling behind amongst their peers. Most of them try &quot;sogaeting&quot;, going out on a blind date, for the first time to get into a relationship. Courtship is a duty that most people feel they must take on to not seem incompetent.
In recent trends, even dramas such as “”Shining Romance” (“빛나는 로맨스”), and “Jang Bo-ri is Here!” (“왔다 장보리”), and in a variety show called, “Dad! Where Are We Going?” (“아빠 어디가?”) there are elementary children confessing their love.

courtship has also been depicted to be an activity of fun and happiness. There are Korean TV programs that film celebrities together as married couples supporting this depiction of courtship such as “We Got Married” (“우리 결혼했어요”), “With You” (“님과 함께”) and “The Man Who Gets Married Daily” (“매일 결혼 하는 남자.”)

According to a survey by wedding consulting agency, men consider a physical relation as a catalyst of love, otherwise, women regard it as a confirmation of affection. Adding to it, both 79.2% of men and 71.0% of women stated that how deep their physical relation in courtship is concerned in the decision of whether to marry.

==== Pakistan ====
Marriages and courtship in Pakistan are influenced by traditional cultural practices similar to those elsewhere in the Indian subcontinent as well as Muslim norms and manners. Illegitimate relationships before marriage are considered a social taboo and social interaction between unmarried men and women is encouraged at a modest and healthy level. Couples are usually wedded through either an arranged marriage or love marriage. Love marriages are those in which the individuals have chosen a partner whom they like by their own choice prior to marriage, and usually occur with the consent of parents and family. Arranged marriages on the other hand are marriages which are set and agreed by the families or guardians of the two individuals where the couple may not have met before. In either cases and in consistency with traditional marital practices, individuals who marry are persuaded to meet and talk to each other for some time before considering marrying so that they can check their compatibility.

==== Singapore ====
Singapore&#x27;s largest courtship service, SDU, Social Development Unit, is government-run. The original SDU, which controversially promoted marriages among university graduate singles, no longer exists today. On 28 January 2009, it was merged with SDS [Social Development Services], which just as controversially promoted marriages among non-graduate singles. The merged unit, SDN Social Development Network seeks to promote meaningful relationships, with marriage touted as a top life goal, among all resident [Singapore] singles within a conducive network environment of singles, relevant commercial and public entities.

==== Taiwan ====

One report suggested that in southern Taiwan, &quot;traditional rules of courtship&quot; still apply despite the influence of popular culture; for example, men continue to take the initiative in forming relationships. A poll in 2009 of students at high schools and vocational schools found that over 90% admitted that they had &quot;no clear idea of how to approach someone of the opposite sex who interested them&quot;. What caused relationships to break up? 60% said &quot;changes of heart&quot; or &quot;cheating&quot;. Courtship with more than one person at a time was not permissible, agreed 70%.

==== Iran ====
Legally people of different sexes are not allowed to &quot;mix freely&quot; in public. Since 1979, the state has become a religious autocracy, and imposes Islamic edicts on matters such as courtship. Clerics run officially sanctioned internet courtship agencies with strict rules. Prospective couples can have three meetings: two with strict supervision inside the center, and the third being a &quot;brief encounter on their own&quot;; afterwards, they can either (1) choose to marry or (2) agree to never see each other again. This has become the subject of a film by Iranian filmmaker Leila Lak. Iran has a large population of young people with 70 percent of the 83-million population being under the age of thirty. However, economic hardship discourages marriage, and divorce rates have increased in Tehran to around a quarter of marriages, even though divorce is taboo. While the Iranian government &quot;condemns courtship and relationships&quot;, it promotes marriage with (1) online courses (2) &quot;courtship classes&quot; where students can &quot;earn a diploma&quot; after sitting through weekly tests and &quot;hundreds of hours of education&quot; (3) &quot;marriage diplomas&quot; (4) matchmaking and arranged marriages. Authorities push a conservative approach and shun unmarried romantic relationships and encourage &quot;traditional match-making&quot;. But young people have disobeyed the restrictions; one said &quot;It is wiser to have different relationships&quot; and believed in defying religious rules which suggest &quot;short-term illegitimate relationships harm dignity&quot;. Adultery can be punished by death. While youths can flout selected restrictions, there are almost no instances in which unmarried people move in together. There have been efforts to promote &quot;Sigheh&quot; (temporary marriage).

Whilst the practice of so-called &quot;white marriage&quot; (cohabitation) is trending, it is illegal.

==== Israel ====
In Israel, in the secular community, courtship is very common amongst both heterosexual and homosexual couples. However, because of the religious community, there are some religious exceptions to the courtship process. In the Haredi and Chasidic communities (Ultra-Orthodox Judaism) most couples are paired through a matchmaker. 

==== Lebanon ====
One report suggests courtship is hampered by &quot;the weight of family demands upon individual choice&quot; and that there were difficulties, particularly for people seeking to marry across religious lines, such as a Christian seeking to marry a Muslim.

=== North America ===
==== United States====

One report suggested the United States as well as other western-oriented countries were different from the rest of the world because &quot;love is the reason for mating&quot;, as opposed to marriages being arranged to cement economic and class ties between families and promote political stability. Courtship–known there as &#x27;dating&#x27;–by mutual consent of two single people, is the norm. British writer Kira Cochrane, after moving to the U.S., found herself grappling with the American approach to courtship. She wondered why it was acceptable to juggle &quot;10 potential partners&quot; while weighing different attributes; she found American-style dating to be &quot;exhausting and strange&quot;. She found courtship in America to be &quot;organized in a fairly formal fashion&quot; with men approaching women and asking point blank for a date; she found this to be &quot;awkward&quot;. She described the socially constructed “third date rule&quot; which was that women were not supposed to have sex until the third date even if they desired it, although men were supposed to try for sex. She wrote: &quot;Dating rules almost always cast the man as aggressor, and the woman as prey, which frankly makes me feel nauseous.&quot; Canadian writer Danielle Crittenden, chronicling female angst, criticized a tendency not to take courtship seriously and suggested that postponing marriage into one&#x27;s thirties was problematic:

Journalist Emily Witt in 2016 wrote that while &quot;social mores had changed to accept a wider range of sexual practices&quot;, there was still much &quot;loneliness and anxiety&quot;. She traveled to San Francisco and began dating a lot, using Internet dating services and apps, and sometimes going to singles&#x27; bars alone, only to find that the &quot;romantic-comedy concept of love&quot; with a &quot;perfect, permanent, tea-for-two ending&quot; was not going to happen to her.

There is evidence that couples differ in the pace and timing with which they initiate sex in their relationships. Studies show that approximately 50% of premarital young adult couples become sexually involved within the first month of dating, while 25% initiate sex one to three months after beginning to date and a small proportion of couples wait until marriage before initiating sexual relations.

Teenagers and college-aged students tend to avoid the more formal activity of dating, and prefer casual no-strings-attached experiments sometimes described as &#x27;s&#x27;. It permits young women to &quot;go out and fit into the social scene, get attention from young men, and learn about sexuality&quot;, according to one report by sociologists. The term &quot;hookup&quot; can describe a wide variety of behavior ranging from kissing to non-genital touching; according to one report, only about one third of people had sexual intercourse. A contrary report, however, suggested there has been no &quot;sea change&quot; in sexual behavior regarding college students from 1988 onwards, and that the term &quot;hookup&quot; itself continued to be used to describe a variety of relationships, including merely socializing or passionate kissing as well as sexual intercourse.

Muslims living in the United States can choose whether to use traditional Islamic methods, or date American-style; Muslims choosing to stick to Islamic tradition can &quot;only marry another Muslim&quot;, according to one Malaysian account. Mosques have been known to try to bring people together––one in California has a dating service for Muslims.

=== Europe ===

==== United Kingdom ====

In Britain, if two people are &#x27;going out together&#x27; their relationship has normally advanced to a relatively long-standing and sexual boyfriend-girlfriend relationship although they are not cohabiting. Writer Kira Cochrane advises to &quot;get out there and meet people&quot; while noting a trend of temporary suspension of marriage until an individual reaches his or her thirties. She sees a trend for developing new ways of meeting people. In contrast, writer Bibi van der Zee found etiquette rules to be helpful, and found that supposedly liberated advice such as &quot;just be yourself&quot; to be the &quot;most useless advice in history&quot;. She expresses frustration following fruitless sexual relationships, and that her mid twenties saw relationships with partners who were less willing to return phone calls or display interest in long-term commitment. She felt &quot;clueless and unwanted&quot;, she wrote, and found advice books such as &quot;The Rules&quot; helpful. British writer Henry Castiglione signed up for a &quot;weekend flirting course&quot; and found the experience helpful; he was advised to talk to and smile at everyone he met. Emailing back-and-forth, after meeting on a website, is one way to get to know people in Britain, and elsewhere.

In the UK, one estimate from 2009 was that 15 million people are single, and half of these are seeking a long-term relationship; three-quarters of them have not been in a relationship for more than 18 months. A Pew study in 2005 which examined Internet users in long-term relationships including marriage, found that many met by contacts at work or at school. In a twelve-month period, the average number of assignations that a single person will have is four. When courting, 43% of people &#x27;google&#x27; potential partners ahead of time. Almost five million Britons used websites in the past twelve months. A third admitting to lying on their profile. A fifth of married individuals between 19 and 25 met their spouse online. One poll in 2009 of 3,000 couples suggested that the average duration of their courtship period, between first meeting to the acceptance of a marriage proposal, was three years. In 2017 Britain online fraud victim numbers were at record high. According to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau, there were 3,889 victims of so-called romance fraud in 2016. who handed over a record £39m. Online safety in the UK is a concern for authorities and individuals.

==== German-speaking countries ====

While analysts such as Harald Martenstein and others suggest that it is easier for persons to initiate contact in America, many Germans view the American dating habits as &quot;unspontaneous&quot;, &quot;ridiculous&quot; and &quot;rigid&quot;. Until the 1960s, countries such as Germany, Switzerland and Austria had a more formal approach for first contacts that was eased during seasonal festivals like carnival and festivals and funfairs like the Oktoberfest, which allowed for more casual flirts.

Membership in voluntary associations is relatively high in German-speaking countries and these provided further chances for possible partners to meet. Strolling on Esplanades and Promenade walkways such as the one in Hamburg called the Jungfernstieg (maidens way), have been another venue for introductions as early as the 19th century. Analyst Geoffrey Gorer described &#x27;dating&#x27; as an American idiosyncrasy focusing on youth of college age and expressed in activities such as American &#x27;proms&#x27;. In contrast German speaking countries and the longstanding musical tradition there provided ample opportunity of persons of varying ages enjoying social dances, such as the Vienna Opera Ball and other occasions.

Romantic encounters were often described with French terms like or . The German term of &quot;Stelldichein&quot; (as translated by Joachim Heinrich Campes) is used to signify courtship when the age of consent to marriage was relatively high. German traditions to signify lovers who met in hiding were described with terms like &quot;Fensterln&quot; (windowing) or &quot;Kiltgang&quot; (dawn stroll) used in Bavaria and Switzerland. Analyst Sebastian Heinzel sees a major cultural divide between American courtship habits and European informality, and leads to instances in which European expatriates in cities such as New York keep to themselves.

Today, most German couples in long-term relationships get to know each other through mutual friends, at work or while going out at night; the first few months of courtship often involve sexual intercourse, but are still rather casual and do not imply a serious wish to get married.

==== Italy ====
Italians maintain a conservative approach to courtship. Also, inviting friends or relatives during a rendezvous is not uncommon. More modern approaches such as &#x27;blind dates,&#x27; &#x27;speed dating&#x27; and websites are not as popular as abroad, and are not considered very effective by the majority of the population.

=== Oceania ===

==== Australia ====
A study revealed that 50% of Australians agreed it was permissible to request to &#x27;go out&#x27; via a text message but not acceptable to break up this way. Flirting while texting, dubbed &quot;flirtext&quot;, was more likely to be done by girls after a relationship was started. A survey of newspaper readers suggested it was time to abandon the &quot;old fashioned rule&quot; of men paying for the first outing, based on women&#x27;s greater earning capacity.

=== South America ===

==== Brazil ====
In Brazil there is a longer time interval before children move out of the house, which affects courtship. As a result, parents offer advice about courtship although it may not be heeded.

== LGBT+ ==
Courtship behavior of non-heterosexual individuals does not always reflect their self-ascribed sexual orientation. Some of them recognized from early age that they are attracted to the same sex or both/all sexes, but may initially adhere to heterosexual norms in their courtship behaviors. Some individuals who identify as LGBT+ in one way or another but are questioning or have not come out to their peers and family may wait years before they start courting their preferred sex.

According to a &quot;Psychology Today&quot; report, men who identify as homosexual recognize their same-sex attraction in their late teens or early twenties, and they tend to care more about physical attractiveness than the status of a prospective partner. Men who identify as homosexual, on average, tend to have more sexual partners, while women who identify as lesbian tend to form steadier one-on-one relationships, and tend to be less promiscuous than heterosexual women.

In India, transgender individuals and eunuchs have used internet dating to help them find partners, but there continue to be strong societal pressures which marginalize them.

== Matchmakers ==

People can meet other people on their own or the get-together can be arranged by someone else. Matchmaking is an art based entirely on hunches, since it is impossible to predict with certainty whether two people will like each other or not. &quot;All you should ever try and do is make two people be in the same room at the same time&quot;, advised matchmaker Sarah Beeny in 2009, and the only rule is to make sure the people involved want to be set up. One matchmaker advised it was good to match &quot;brains as well as beauty&quot; and try to find people with similar religious and political viewpoints. They added that finding like-minded people results in more matches, although acknowledged that opposites sometimes attract.

=== Friends as matchmakers ===
Friends remain a common way for people to meet. However, the Internet promises to overtake friends in the future, if present trends continue. A friend can introduce two people who do not know each other, and the friend may play matchmaker and send them on a .

=== Family as matchmakers ===
Parents, via their contacts with associates or neighbors or friends, can introduce their children to each other. In India, parents often place matrimonial ads in newspapers or online, and may post the resumes of the prospective bride or groom.

=== Matchmaking systems and services ===
Matchmaking systems can be systematic and organized ways to improve matchmaking by using rules or technology. The meeting can be in-person or &quot;live&quot; as well as separated by time or space such as by telephone or email or chat-based. The purpose of the meeting is for the two persons to decide whether to go out together in the future.

<text>Uslar (; Eastphalian: &quot;Üsseler&quot;) is a town and a municipality in southern Lower Saxony, Germany, in the south-western part of the district of Northeim, and in the south of the hills of Solling forest which are part of the Weser Uplands.

Uslar is located on the German Timber-Frame Road.

== Geography ==
Uslar lies close to the borders of Hesse and North Rhine-Westphalia.
Hanover is to the north, Hesse&#x27;s biggest city Frankfurt am Main is to the south, and Berlin is to northeast.

=== Division of the municipality ===
The municipality of Uslar consists of 19 towns and villages: Ahlbershausen, Allershausen, Bollensen, Delliehausen, Dinkelhausen, Eschershausen, Fürstenhagen, Gierswalde, Kammerborn, Offensen, Schlarpe, Schönhagen, Schoningen, Sohlingen, Uslar, Vahle, Verliehausen, Volpriehausen and Wiensen.
== Transport ==
Uslar can be reached by car via the Landstraße (state&#x27;s route) L554 from Göttingen.
Through Uslar passes the Bundesstraße (federal route) B241 out of direction of Beverungen to Northeim.
The closest Autobahns are the A7 (from Ausfahrt (Exit) Nörten-Hardenberg) and A44 (Ausfahrt Warburg).
The nearest international airports are Hanover (IATA-Code: HAJ; ICAO EDDV), Paderborn-Lippstadt (IATA-Code: PAD) and Kassel-Calden.
1NM western the city center is a gliding airfield by the local soaring association LSV Solling e. V.
Furthermore, Uslar can be reached by the Solling Railway via Northeim.
From Göttingen, Uslar can be reached by bus route 210 direction Uslar, from Holzminden, bus route 510.

== History ==
Uslar was first mentioned in 1006/1007.
In the second half of the 12th century, the Welfen-dynasty started to rule Uslar until the 19th century.
In 1599, the castle of Freudenthal was built, which burned down in 1612.
In 1819 big parts of the town of Uslar burned down.

== Economy and business ==

In the 20th century, Uslar&#x27;s furniture industry (Ilse-Möbel company, approx. 2000 employees in the 1950s) was world-famous.
Nowadays, only tourism plays an important role in the area of Uslar (&quot;Uslarer Land&quot;).
There is also the Privatbrauerei Haffner, which brews the Bergbräu family of beers, bottled in pop-top bottles much like Schleswig-Holstein&#x27;s Flensburger beer and Holland&#x27;s Grolsch.

The municipality Uslar is highly indebted.
For example, the local swimming pool had to close in May 2011 and could only be re-opened in November 2012, with the help of a local initiative. Since 2005 the population has been steadily decreasing, averaging at 168 people per year.

<text>Alexander Friedrich Ladislaus Roda Roda (13 April 1872 – 20 August 1945) was an Austrian writer and satirist. 

==Biography==
Roda Roda was born as Šandor Friedrich Rosenfeld in Drnowitz, Moravia, Austria-Hungary (now Drnovice, Czech Republic). His sister was the physician Gisela Januszewska. As a child, he moved with his family to Slavonia. He Germanized his name from Šandor to Alexander, and his surname from Rosenfeld to Roda Roda. Roda is the Croatian word for stork. He chose his new surname because storks nested on the chimney of his house in Esseg (today Osijek).

In 1894, Roda Roda converted from Judaism to Catholicism. In 1902, Roda Roda quit the military career and became a journalist (during World War I he was war correspondent); he contributed to the German satirical magazine &quot;Simplicissimus&quot;. In 1938, he emigrated to the US. He wrote many comedies (&quot;Der König von Crucina&quot;, 1892; &quot;Bubi&quot;, 1912, with Gustav Meyrink), tales and novels (&quot;Soldatengeschichten&quot;, 2 volumes, 1904; &quot;Der Ehegarten&quot;, 1913, &quot;Der Schnaps, der Rauchtabak und die verfluchte Liebe&quot;, 1908; &quot;Die Panduren&quot;, 1935), and autobiographical books (&quot;Irrfahrten eines Humoristen 1914–1919&quot;, 1920; &quot;Roda Rodas Roman&quot;, 1925). He died in New York City.

In 1911 Roda Roda published a series of articles for the &quot;Neue Freie Presse&quot;, one of Austria&#x27;s most respected newspapers. Between 1914 and 1917, he produced nearly 700 articles as war correspondent for the paper as well as the German-language newspaper published in Budapest, &quot;Pester Lloyd&quot;. In the 1920s, Roda Roda&#x27;s humorous and satirical book publications were largely successful. He appeared in cabarets, traveled extensively, and had contact with dozens of authors, actors, filmmakers, and other artists of his milieu. His work was part of the literature event in the art competition at the 1936 Summer Olympics.

Roda Roda&#x27;s ashes are buried at Feuerhalle Simmering.

Roda Roda was also a passionate chess player and often played in the Munich coffee house Café Stefanie. Here he found inspiration for his humorous text that discusses chess, &quot;Das Pensionistengambit&quot; (The Pensioners&#x27; Gambit), originally the chapter &quot;Schach&quot; in his 1932 collection &quot;Roda Roda und die vierzig Schurken&quot;.

In 1952, Vienna&#x27;s city district Floridsdorf (the 21st district) named a street, Roda-Roda-Gasse, after the author. The city of Osijek, Croatia, also boasts a bust of Roda Roda in front of the library building in Europska avenija.

In the 20th century, the city&#x27;s economy was built on machine-building, leather-making, typography and design, and the automobile and pharmaceutical industries.

==History==
The first documented reference to a suburb of Offenbach appears in 770. In a document of the Holy Roman Emperor Otto II dating to 977 exists the first mention of the place of Offenbach. During the Middle Ages Offenbach passed through many hands. Only in 1486 could the Count Ludwig of Isenburg finally take control of city for his family, and 1556 Count Reinhard of Isenburg relocated his Residence to Offenbach, building a palace, the Isenburger Schloß (Isenburg Palace), which was completed in 1559. It was destroyed by fire in 1564 and rebuilt in 1578.

In 1635, Offenbach was given to the Landgraves of Hesse-Darmstadt, but it was returned to the Isenburg-Birstein Count (later Prince) in 1642. It remained in that principality until 1815, when the Congress of Vienna gave the city to the Austrian Emperor, Francis I. A year later it was given to the Grand Duchy of Hesse-Darmstadt.

Always very close to the city centre of Frankfurt, Offenbach was a popular location for business. The town has its own trade fair, and many companies have opened facilities here because there are fewer restrictions and no closed businesses. French Protestants (Huguenots) came in the 17th century and settled in Offenbach and contributed to making Offenbach a prosperous city, e.g., bringing knowledge of tobacco with them and turning Offenbach into a centre for rolling cigars. The town was more cosmopolitan than Frankfurt; famous people such as Goethe and Mozart visited it several times.

The Rumpenheim Palace and its park were a popular destination for monarchs in the 19th century. The city was thereafter ruled by Grand Dukes of Hesse and by Rhine until the monarchy was abolished in 1918. Offenbach became the center of the traditional design with figures such as the architect Hugo Eberhardt, the typographer Rudolf Koch, the bookbinder and designer Ignatz Wiemeler and Ernst Engel and the painter Karl Friedrich Lippmann.

During the Second World War, a third of the city was destroyed by Allied bombing, which claimed 467 lives. With the new district Lauterborn the city was expanded to the south in the 1960s. On the border with Frankfurt, the office district Kaiserlei was built. Offenbach is a so-called &quot;Sozialer Brennpunkt&quot; (deprived area) because of unemployment, poverty, gang related crime and migration.

Before its eradication in the Holocaust, the city had a Jewish population. Jews settled in the city as late as the late 16th century, and it is believed that out of the 871 residents of the town as of 1829, the 40 Jewish families accounted for nearly a quarter of the town&#x27;s population. They also established their own cemetery.
==Geography==
===Subdivision===
The inner city area of Offenbach is quite large and consists of the historic center of the city and its expansions of the 1800s. Three formerly independent suburbs were incorporated in the first half of the 20th century: Bürgel being the first in 1908, then Bieber and Rumpenheim in 1938 and 1942.

South of the inner city area are the suburbs Lauterborn, Rosenhöhe and Tempelsee. Kaiserlei is a commercial district in the far west of the city bordering Frankfurt. In the west Waldheim is a residential neighborhood on the city limits with &quot;Mühlheim am Main&quot;. In 2010 the eastern part of the city center was officially named Mathildenviertel, as the area was already unofficially called by the locals.

Unlike most larger cities in Germany, Offenbach was not completely divided into districts. Only the nine neighborhoods mentioned above were officially districts, leaving the largest parts of the city officially unnamed. Although specific names for neighborhoods and areas were already in use among the locals and residents.

In June 2019, the city council approved a new act that subdivides the city&#x27;s area entirely into 21 districts. The nine existing districts largely remained the same, most of them were even expanded. The new districts were laid out after the already by locals commonly known neighborhoods, such as the Westend, the Nordend or Buchhügel. A completely new name was only needed to be found for one neighborhood south of the city center, which never had commonly used name before: Lindenfeld. The name derived from an old name of a land lot in this area, when it was still fields in agricultural use prior to the 1800s.

As of July 2019, there are the following 21 districts:

*Bieber
*Bieberer Berg
*Buchhügel
*Buchrain
*Bürgel
*Carl-Ulrich-Siedlung
*Hafen
*Kaiserlei
*Lauterborn
*Lindenfeld
*Mathildenviertel
*Musikerviertel
*Nordend
*Offenbach-Ost
*Rosenhöhe
*Rumpenheim
*Senefelderquartier
*Tempelsee
*Waldheim
*Westend
*Zentrum
===Climate===
Offenbach experienced a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;). The summer time was subtropical, ranging from 21 °C to about 23 °C in average. Spring time and autumn were warm-temperate, with averages between about 13 °C and 18 °C. The winter was cool-temperate, with daily means from 6 °C to 9 °C. Due to its location in the Upper Rhine Plain, the whole Rhein-Main Metropolitan Region generally experienced one of the warmest climates in Germany, making it possible to grow plants from the subtropics such as vineyards, palm trees and olive trees. 
==Governance==
=== Mayor ===

The current mayor of Offenbach is Felix Schwenke of the Social Democratic Party (SPD). He was first elected in 2017, and was re-elected for a second term in 2023.

==Population history==

Until the end of the 17th century, Offenbach remained a small town with less than a thousand inhabitants. With the coming into power of the count Johann Philipp in 1685, the city began to develop and the population rose steadily. In the 19th century the city became industrialized and the population increased even tenfold. 
Offenbach is one of the German cities where Germans without migrant background make up a minority of the population. As of 31 December 2012, approx. 44.3% of residents or 55,047 people had no foreign background. In contrast to that, there were 55.7% or 69,214 people with at least one non-German grandparent. The largest of those groups are:



==Economy==

Until the early 1970s, Offenbach was dominated by the machine-building and leather industries. The city hosts the German Association for Electrical, Electronic and Information Technologies to this day. The Deutscher Wetterdienst, commonly abbreviated as DWD, (translated from German as German Meteorological Service), residing in the Westend district.

Offenbach was also the European center of typography, with Gebr. Klingspor and Linotype (inventors of Optima or Palatino typeface) moving to nearby Eschborn in the 1970s and MAN Roland printing machines still a major employer today. Typography and design still remain important with a cluster of graphic design and industrial design companies, as well as the university level Hochschule für Gestaltung Offenbach am Main (HfG) design school and the Klingspor Museum.

In recent years Offenbach has become a popular location for a wide array of services, especially from the transport sectors. Offenbach is the host to the European headquarters of Honda, Hyundai Motors and Kumho Tires.

==Transport==

===Roads===
The streets of central Offenbach are usually congested with cars during the rush hour. Some areas, especially around the shopping streets, are pedestrian-only streets. There are numerous car parks located throughout the city. The Offenbacher Kreuz is an Autobahn interchange where the Autobahnen A 3 (Cologne-Würzburg) and A 661 meet. The A661 crosses the A 3 (Cologne-Würzburg) and A 5 (Basel-Hannover).

===Public transport===

The city is connected by a major line of the S-Bahn railway system to Frankfurt. The station in the city center is &quot;Marktplatz&quot;. In general, six stations are located in Offenbach: &quot;Offenbach-Kaiserlei&quot;, &quot;Offenbach-Ledermuseum&quot;, &quot;Offenbach-Marktplatz&quot;, &quot;Offenbach-Ost&quot;, &quot;Offenbach-Bieber&quot;, &quot;Offenbach-Waldhof&quot;. Trains run every 5–10 minutes between Offenbach and Frankfurt. A 24 hours Service between both cities was introduced in 2013. The journey from Offenbach Marktplatz to Frankfurt Main Station takes 15 minutes, Frankfurt Airport can be reached within 26 minutes.
Suburban trains run underground in downtown Offenbach. The city tunnel was opened in 1996. Services split up at Offenbach-Ost Station to Hanau (S8 and S9 trains), Rödermark (S1) and Dietzenbach (S2).
An often-addressed problem is that there is no direct interchange between regional and suburban trains in Offenbach, since the lines were separated when the tunnel was built. Therefore, residents and city officials have proposed several times that platforms for regional trains should be added to the Offenbach-Ost Station.

The city&#x27;s municipal public transportation services are operated by the &quot;Offenbacher Verkehrsbetriebe&quot; (OVB) and its subcontractors.
Nine routes (numbered 101–108 and 120) connect all boroughs with the major train stations at Marktplatz, Offenbach-Ost and Kaiserlei as well as the Central Station. The bus network has very good coverage and frequency of service. All routes except for number 102 and number 107 busses stop at Marktplatz station, making it the most important transit hub in the city. Buses usually run with a 15-minute headway on working days and a 30-minute headway on Sundays, public holidays and after 8:00 pm.
Exemptions are routes 103, 107 and 120 which run every 30 minutes. Number 103 and 120 buses share most of their route, creating a 15-minute headway on the shared section in downtown Offenbach. Those two routes also connect the city of Offenbach with its surrounding towns, Frankfurt am Main, Mühlheim am Main and Obertshausen.
Out of all municipal bus services the number 101 bus is the most frequented route. It runs every 7 or 8 minutes Mondays through Fridays. Service on the other most frequented routes (104 and 105) is also increased to a 7/8-minute headway during rush hours.
In addition to the municipal bus services there are regional buses that serve the city. Two express bus routes connect Offenbach to the city of Langen (route X83) and Bad Vilbel (X97). Other services are the number OF-30 bus to Heusenstamm, the 41 bus to Fechenheim as well as the 551 to Gravenbruch, Enkheim and Bad Vilbel.

Regional trains stop at the Offenbach Central Station in the city&#x27;s center. The station is on the Frankfurt-Hanau main line which is one of railway with the most traffic in Germany. Mostly hourly service for Wächsersbach, Fulda, Würzburg and Erbach call at the Offenbach Central Station.
There is no long-distance train service at central station, although many high-speed trains pass through on their way from Frankfurt to Munich, Berlin or Hamburg.
The station lost most of its importance when the suburban trains were re-routed through the newly build tunnel beneath Berliner Straße. Nonetheless a train ride from Offenbach Central Station to Frankfurt Central Station takes only ten minutes.

===Frankfurt Airport===
The city is accessed from around the world via the Frankfurt Airport, (Flughafen Frankfurt am Main) which is located from Offenbach. The airport can be reached by car or bus and has two train stations, one for regional and one for long-distance traffic. The S-Bahn lines S8 and S9 (direction &quot;Offenbach Ost or &quot;Hanau&quot;), departing from the regional traffic station, take 25 minutes from the airport to get to Offenbach.

<text>Candida albicans is an opportunistic pathogenic yeast that is a common member of the human gut flora. It can also survive outside the human body. It is detected in the gastrointestinal tract and mouth in 40–60% of healthy adults. It is usually a commensal organism, but it can become pathogenic in immunocompromised individuals under a variety of conditions. It is one of the few species of the genus &quot;Candida&quot; that cause the human infection candidiasis, which results from an overgrowth of the fungus. Candidiasis is, for example, often observed in HIV-infected patients.
&quot;C. albicans&quot; is the most common fungal species isolated from biofilms either formed on (permanent) implanted medical devices or on human tissue. &quot;C. albicans&quot;, &quot;C. tropicalis&quot;, &quot;C. parapsilosis&quot;, and &quot;C. glabrata&quot; are together responsible for 50–90% of all cases of candidiasis in humans. A mortality rate of 40% has been reported for patients with systemic candidiasis due to &quot;C. albicans&quot;. By one estimate, invasive candidiasis contracted in a hospital causes 2,800 to 11,200 deaths yearly in the US. Nevertheless, these numbers may not truly reflect the true extent of damage this organism causes, given studies indicating that &quot;C. albicans&quot; can cross the blood–brain barrier in mice.

&quot;C. albicans&quot; is commonly used as a model organism for fungal pathogens. It is generally referred to as a dimorphic fungus since it grows both as yeast and filamentous cells. However, it has several different morphological phenotypes including opaque, GUT, and pseudohyphal forms. &quot;C. albicans&quot; was for a long time considered an obligate diploid organism without a haploid stage. This is, however, not the case. Next to a haploid stage &quot;C. albicans&quot; can also exist in a tetraploid stage. The latter is formed when diploid &quot;C. albicans&quot; cells mate when they are in the opaque form. The diploid genome size is approximately 29 Mb, and up to 70% of the protein coding genes have not yet been characterized.
&quot;C. albicans&quot; is easily cultured in the lab and can be studied both &quot;in vivo&quot; and &quot;in vitro&quot;. Depending on the media different studies can be done as the media influences the morphological state of &quot;C. albicans&quot;. A special type of medium is CHROMagar &quot;Candida&quot;, which can be used to identify different &quot;Candida&quot; species.

==Etymology==
&quot;Candida albicans&quot; can be read as tautological. &quot;&quot; comes from the Latin word &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;shining white&quot;. &quot; itself is the present participle of the Latin word &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;becoming white&quot;. This leads to one possible interpretation as the redundant phrase &quot;pure white becoming white&quot;.

It is often shortly referred to as thrush, candidiasis, or candida.
More than a hundred synonyms have been used to describe &quot;C. albicans&quot;.
Over 200 species have been described within the candida genus. The oldest reference to thrush, most likely caused by &quot;C. albicans&quot;, dates back to 400 BC in Hippocrates&#x27; work &quot;Of the Epidemics&quot; describing oral candidiasis.

==Genome==


The genome of &quot;C. albicans&quot; is almost 16Mb for the haploid size (28Mb for the diploid stage) and consists of 8 sets of chromosome pairs called chr1A, chr2A, chr3A, chr4A, chr5A, chr6A, chr7A and . The second set (&quot;C. albicans&quot; is diploid) has similar names but with a B at the end. Chr1B, chr2B, ... and chrRB. The whole genome contains 6,198 open reading frames (ORFs). Seventy percent of these ORFs have not yet been characterized. The whole genome has been sequenced making it one of the first fungi to be completely sequenced (next to &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; and &quot;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&quot;). All open reading frames (ORFs) are also available in Gateway-adapted vectors. Next to this ORFeome there is also the availability of a GRACE (gene replacement and conditional expression) library to study essential genes in the genome of &quot;C. albicans&quot;. The most commonly used strains to study &quot;C. albicans&quot; are the WO-1 and SC5314 strains. The WO-1 strain is known to switch between white-opaque form with higher frequency while the SC5314 strain is the strain used for gene sequence reference.

One of the most important features of the &quot;C. albicans&quot; genome is the high heterozygosity. At the base of this heterozygosity lies the occurrence of numeric and structural chromosomal rearrangements and changes as means of generating genetic diversity by chromosome length polymorphisms (contraction/expansion of repeats), reciprocal translocations, chromosome deletions, Nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms and trisomy of individual chromosomes. These karyotypic alterations lead to changes in the phenotype, which is an adaptation strategy of this fungus. These mechanisms are further being explored with the availability of the complete analysis of the &quot;C. albicans&quot; genome.

An unusual feature of the genus &quot;Candida&quot; is that in many of its species (including &quot;C. albicans&quot; and &quot;C. tropicalis&quot;, but not, for instance, &quot;C. glabrata&quot;) the CUG codon, which normally specifies leucine, specifies serine in these species. This is an unusual example of a departure from the standard genetic code, and most such departures are in start codons or, for eukaryotes, mitochondrial genetic codes. This alteration may, in some environments, help these &quot;Candida&quot; species by inducing a permanent stress response, a more generalized form of the heat shock response. However, this different codon usage makes it more difficult to study &quot;C. albicans&quot; protein-protein interactions in the model organism &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot;. To overcome this problem a &quot;C. albicans&quot; specific two-hybrid system was developed.

The genome of &quot;C. albicans&quot; is highly dynamic, contributed by the different CUG translation, and this variability has been used advantageously for molecular epidemiological studies and population studies in this species. The genome sequence has allowed for identifying the presence of a parasexual cycle (no detected meiotic division) in &quot;C. albicans&quot;. This study of the evolution of sexual reproduction in six &quot;Candida&quot; species found recent losses in components of the major meiotic crossover-formation pathway, but retention of a minor pathway. The authors suggested that if &quot;Candida&quot; species undergo meiosis it is with reduced machinery, or different machinery, and indicated that unrecognized meiotic cycles may exist in many species. In another evolutionary study, introduction of partial CUG identity redefinition (from &quot;Candida&quot; species) into &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; clones caused a stress response that negatively affected sexual reproduction. This CUG identity redefinition, occurring in ancestors of &quot;Candida&quot; species, was thought to lock these species into a diploid or polyploid state with possible blockage of sexual reproduction.

==Morphology==
&quot;C. albicans&quot; exhibits a wide range of morphological phenotypes due to phenotypic switching and bud to hypha transition. The yeast-to-hyphae transition (filamentation) is a rapid process and induced by environmental factors. Phenotypic switching is spontaneous, happens at lower rates and in certain strains up to seven different phenotypes are known. The best studied switching mechanism is the white to opaque switching (an epigenetic process). Other systems have been described as well. Two systems (the high-frequency switching system and white to opaque switching) were discover by David R. Soll and colleagues. Switching in &quot;C. albicans&quot; is often, but not always, influenced by environmental conditions such as the level of CO2, anaerobic conditions, medium used and temperature.
In its yeast form &quot;C. albicans&quot; ranges from 10 to 12 microns. Spores can form on the pseudohyphae called chlamydospores which survive when put in unfavorable conditions such as dry or hot seasons.
===Yeast-to-hypha switching===

Although often referred to as dimorphic, &quot;C. albicans&quot; is, in fact, polyphenic (often also referred to as pleomorphic). When cultured in standard yeast laboratory medium, &quot;C. albicans&quot; grows as ovoid &quot;yeast&quot; cells. However, mild environmental changes in temperature, CO2, nutrients and pH can result in a morphological shift to filamentous growth. Filamentous cells share many similarities with yeast cells. Both cell types seem to play a specific, distinctive role in the survival and pathogenicity of &quot;C. albicans&quot;. Yeast cells seem to be better suited for the dissemination in the bloodstream while hyphal cells have been proposed as a virulence factor. Hyphal cells are invasive and speculated to be important for tissue penetration, colonization of organs and surviving plus escaping macrophages. The transition from yeast to hyphal cells is termed to be one of the key factors in the virulence of &quot;C. albicans&quot;; however, it is not deemed necessary. When &quot;C. albicans&quot; cells are grown in a medium that mimics the physiological environment of a human host, they grow as filamentous cells (both true hyphae and pseudohyphae). &quot;C. albicans&quot; can also form chlamydospores, the function of which remains unknown, but it is speculated they play a role in surviving harsh environments as they are most often formed under unfavorable conditions.

The cAMP-PKA signaling cascade is crucial for the morphogenesis and an important transcriptional regulator for the switch from yeast like cells to filamentous cells is EFG1.

===High-frequency switching===

Besides the well-studied yeast-to-hyphae transition other switching systems have been described. One such system is the &quot;high-frequency switching&quot; system. During this switching different cellular morphologies (phenotypes) are generated spontaneously. This type of switching does not occur en masse, represents a variability system and it happens independently from environmental conditions. The strain 3153A produces at least seven different colony morphologies. In many strains the different phases convert spontaneously to the other(s) at a low frequency. The switching is reversible, and colony type can be inherited from one generation to another.
Being able to switch through so many different (morphological) phenotypes makes &quot;C. albicans&quot; able to grow in different environments, both as a commensal and as a pathogen.

In the 3153A strain, a gene called &quot;SIR2&quot; (for silent information regulator), which seems to be important for phenotypic switching, has been found. &quot;SIR2&quot; was originally found in &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; (brewer&#x27;s yeast), where it is involved in chromosomal silencing—a form of transcriptional regulation, in which regions of the genome are reversibly inactivated by changes in chromatin structure (chromatin is the complex of DNA and proteins that make chromosomes). In yeast, genes involved in the control of mating type are found in these silent regions, and &quot;SIR2&quot; represses their expression by maintaining a silent-competent chromatin structure in this region. The discovery of a &quot;C. albicans SIR2&quot; implicated in phenotypic switching suggests it, too, has silent regions controlled by &quot;SIR2&quot;, in which the phenotype-specific genes may reside. How &quot;SIR2&quot; itself is regulated in &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; may yet provide more clues as to the switching mechanisms of &quot;C. albicans&quot;.

===White-opaque switching===

Next to the dimorphism and the first described high-frequency switching system &quot;C. albicans&quot; undergoes another high-frequency switching process called white-opaque switching, which is another phenotypic switching process in &quot;C. albicans&quot;. It was the second high-frequency switching system discovered in &quot;C. albicans&quot;. The white-opaque switch is an epigenetic switching system. Phenotypic switching is often used to refer to white-opaque switching, which consists of two phases: one that grows as round cells in smooth, white colonies (referred to as white form) and one that is rod-like and grows as flat, gray colonies (called opaque form). This switch between white cells and opaque cells is important for the virulence and the mating process of &quot;C. albicans&quot; as the opaque form is the mating competent form, being a million times more efficient in mating compared to the white type. This switching between white and opaque form is regulated by the WOR1 regulator (White to Opaque Regulator 1) which is controlled by the mating type locus (MTL) repressor (a1-α2) that inhibits the expression of WOR1. Besides the white and opaque phase there is also a third one: the gray phenotype. This phenotype shows the highest ability to cause cutaneous infections. The white, opaque, and gray phenotypes form a phenotypic switching system where white cells switch to and from the opaque phase, white cells can irreversibly switch to the gray phase, and both white and gray cells can switch to and from the opaque/an opaque-like phase, respectively. Since it is often difficult to differentiate between white, opaque and gray cells phloxine B, a dye, can be added to the medium.

A potential regulatory molecule in the white to opaque switching is &quot;Efg1p&quot;, a transcription factor found in the WO-1 strain that regulates dimorphism, and more recently has been suggested to help regulate phenotypic switching. &quot;Efg1p&quot; is expressed only in the white and not in the gray cell-type, and overexpression of &quot;Efg1p&quot; in the gray form causes a rapid conversion to the white form.

===Environmental stress===

Glucose starvation is a likely common environmental stress encountered by &quot;C. albicans&quot; in its natural habitat. Glucose starvation causes an increase in intracellular reactive oxygen. This stress can lead to mating between two individuals of the same mating type, an interaction that may be frequent in nature under stressful conditions.

===White-GUT switch===
A very special type of phenotypic switch is the white-GUT switch (Gastrointestinally-IndUced Transition). GUT cells are extremely adapted to survival in the digestive tract by metabolic adaptations to available nutrients in the digestive tract. The GUT cells live as commensal organisms and outcompete other phenotypes. The transition from white to GUT cells is driven by passage through the gut where environmental parameters trigger this transition by increasing the WOR1 expression.

==Role in disease==

&quot;Candida&quot; is found worldwide but most commonly compromises immunocompromised individuals diagnosed with serious diseases such as HIV and cancer. &quot;Candida&quot; are ranked as one of the most common groups of organisms that cause hospital-acquired infections. Especially high-risk individuals are patients that have recently undergone surgery, a transplant or are in the Intensive Care Units (ICU), &quot;C. albicans&quot; infections is the top source of fungal infections in critically ill or otherwise immunocompromised patients. These patients predominantly develop oropharyngeal or thrush candidiasis, which can lead to malnutrition and interfere with the absorption of medication. Methods of transmission include mother to infant through childbirth, people-to-people acquired infections that most commonly occur in hospital settings where immunocompromised patients acquire the yeast from healthcare workers and has a 40% incident rate. People can become infected after having sex with a woman that has an existing vaginal yeast infection. Parts of the body that are commonly infected include the skin, genitals, throat, mouth, and blood. Distinguishing features of vaginal infection include discharge, and dry and red appearance of vaginal mucosa or skin. &quot;Candida&quot; continues to be the fourth most commonly isolated organism in bloodstream infections. Healthy people usually do not suffer (severely) from superficial infections caused by a local alteration in cellular immunity as seen by asthma patients that use oral corticosteroids.

===Superficial and local infections===

It commonly occurs as a superficial infection on mucous membranes in the mouth or vagina. Once in their lives around 75% of women will suffer from vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) and about 90% of these infections are caused by &quot;C. albicans&quot;. It may also affect a number of other regions. For example, higher prevalence of colonization of &quot;C. albicans&quot; was reported in young individuals with tongue piercing, in comparison to unpierced matched individuals, but not in healthy young individuals who use intraoral orthodontic acrylic appliances. To infect host tissue, the usual unicellular yeast-like form of &quot;C. albicans&quot; reacts to environmental cues and switches into an invasive, multicellular filamentous form, a phenomenon called dimorphism. In addition, an overgrowth infection is considered a superinfection, the term usually applied when an infection becomes opportunistic and very resistant to antifungals. It then becomes suppressible by antibiotics. The infection is prolonged when the original sensitive strain is replaced by the antifungal-resistant strain.

Candidiasis is known to cause gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms particularly in immunocompromised patients or those receiving steroids (e.g. to treat asthma) or antibiotics. Recently, there is an emerging literature that an overgrowth of fungus in the small intestine of non-immunocompromised subjects may cause unexplained GI symptoms. Small intestinal fungal overgrowth (SIFO) is characterized by the presence of an excessive number of fungal organisms in the small intestine associated with gastrointestinal symptoms. The most common symptoms observed in these patients were belching, bloating, indigestion, nausea, diarrhea, and gas. The underlying mechanism(s) that predisposes to SIFO is unclear. Further studies are needed; both to confirm these observations and to examine the clinical relevance of fungal overgrowth.

===Systemic infections===

Systemic fungal infections (fungemias) including those by &quot;C. albicans&quot; have emerged as important causes of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients (e.g., AIDS, cancer chemotherapy, organ or bone marrow transplantation). &quot;C. albicans&quot; often forms biofilms inside the body. Such &quot;C. albicans&quot; biofilms may form on the surface of implantable medical devices or organs. In these biofilms it is often found together with &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;. Such multispecies infections lead to higher mortalities. In addition hospital-acquired infections by &quot;C. albicans&quot; have become a cause of major health concerns. Especially once candida cells are introduced in the bloodstream a high mortality, up to 40–60% can occur.

Although &quot;Candida albicans&quot; is the most common cause of candidemia, there has been a decrease in the incidence and an increased isolation of non-albicans species of &quot;Candida&quot; in recent years. Preventive measures include maintaining a good oral hygiene, keeping a healthy lifestyle including good nutrition, the careful use of antibiotics, treatment of infected areas and keeping skin dry and clean, free from open wounds.

===Role of &quot;C. albicans&quot; in Crohn&#x27;s disease===
The link between &quot;C. albicans&quot; and Crohn&#x27;s disease has been investigated in a large cohort. This study demonstrated that members of families with multiple cases of Crohn&#x27;s disease were more likely to be colonized by &quot;C. albicans&quot; than members of control families. Experimental studies show that chemically induced colitis promotes &quot;C. albicans&quot; colonization. In turn, &quot;C. albicans&quot; colonization generates anti-&quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; antibodies (ASCA), increases inflammation, histological scores and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression.

===Diagnosis===
A United States study in 2022 showed that most cases of candidiasis are treated empirically (without culture, pending culture or by symptoms in cases where culture did not show candida), thus not knowing whether the subtype is &quot;Candida albicans&quot; or any other candida species. For subtyping of candidiasis, a fungal culture can be performed, followed by a germ tube test in which a sample of fungal spores are suspended in animal serum and examined by microscopy for the detection of any germ tubes. Colonies of white or cream color on fungal culture having a positive germ tube test is strongly indicative of &quot;Candida albicans&quot;.
===Treatment===
There are relatively few drugs that can successfully treat Candidiasis. Treatment commonly includes:
* amphotericin B, echinocandin, or fluconazole for systemic infections
* nystatin for oral and esophageal infections
* clotrimazole for skin and genital yeast infections
Similarly to antibiotic resistance, resistance to many anti-fungals is becoming a problem. New anti-fungals have to be developed to cope with this problem since only a limited number of anti-fungals are available. A general problem is that in contrast to bacteria, fungi are often overlooked as a potential health problem.

===Economic implications===
Given the fact that candidiasis is the fourth- (to third-) most frequent hospital acquired infection worldwide it leads to immense financial implications. Approximately 60,000 cases of systemic candidiasis each year in the USA alone lead up to a cost to be between $2–4 billion. The total costs for candidiasis are among the highest compared to other fungal infections due to the high prevalence. The immense costs are partly explained by a longer stay in the intensive care unit or hospital in general. An extended stay for up to 21 more days compared to non-infected patients is not uncommon.

=== Role of GSDMD in C.albicans infection ===
Gasdermin D (GSDMD) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the GSDMD gene and is a known target of the inflammasome and acts as an effector molecule of programmed cell death known as pyroptosis. This protein determines cell lysis to prevent pathogen replication and results in the release of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) into the extracellular space to recruit and activate immune cells at the site of infection. Inflammasome activation due to C.albicans infection triggers the release of a cytokine storm necessary to fight the pathogen. Excessive release of these pro-inflammatory mediators has been shown to exaggerate systemic inflammation leading to vascular injury and damage to vital organs. Unfortunately, Candida albicans therapy is often ineffective despite the availability of many antifungal drugs, mainly because of resistance phenomena. During conventional pyroptosis controlled by the inflammasome-GSDMD axis is hijacked by C. albicans to facilitate escape from macrophages through unfolding of hyphae and candidalysin, a fungal toxin released from hyphae. It has been shown that disruption of GSDMD in macrophages infected with Candida albicans reduces the fungal load. In addition, the presence of hyphae and candidalysin are key factors in the activation of GSDMD and the release of Candida from macrophages. Also using Candida-infected mice, inhibition of GSDMD has been shown to paradoxically improve prognosis and survival, indicating that this protein may be a potential therapeutic target in C. albicans-induced sepsis.

==Biofilm development==

===Biofilm formation steps===
The biofilm of &quot;C. albicans&quot; is formed in four steps. First, there is the initial adherence step, where the yeast-form cells adhere to the substrate. The second step is called Intermediate step, where the cells propagate to form microcolonies, and germ tubes form to yield hyphae. In the maturation step, the biofilm biomass expands, the extracellular matrix accumulates and drug resistance increases. In the last step of biofilm formation, the yeast-form cells are released to colonize the surrounding environment (dispersion). Yeast cells released from a biofilm have novel properties, including increased virulence and drug tolerance.
===Zap1===
Zap1, also known as Csr1 and Sur1 (zinc-responsive activator protein), is a transcription factor required for the &quot;C. albicans&quot; hypha formation in biofilms. Zap1 controls the equilibrium of yeast and hyphal cells, the zinc transporters and zinc regulated genes in biofilms of &quot;C. albicans&quot;.
===Zinc===
Zinc (Zn2+) is important for cell function of &quot;C. albicans&quot; and Zap1 controls the Zinc levels in the cells through the zinc transporters Zrt1 and Zrt2. The regulation of zinc concentration in the cells is important for the cell viability and if the zinc levels get too high, it is toxic for the cells. The Zrt1 is transporting the zinc ions with high affinity and the Zrt2 is transporting the zinc ions with low affinity.

==Mechanisms and proteins important for pathogenesis==

===Filamentation===
The ability to switch between yeast cells and hyphal cells is an important virulence factor. Many proteins play a role in this very complex process. The formation of hyphae can for example help &quot;Candida albicans&quot; to escape from macrophages in the human body. Moreover, &quot;C. albicans&quot; undergo yeast-to-hyphal transition within the acidic macrophage phagosome. This initially causes phagosome membrane distension which eventually leads to phagosomal alkalinization by physical rupture, followed by escape.

===Hwp1===

Hwp1 stands for Hyphal wall protein 1. Hwp1 is a mannoprotein located on the surface of the hyphae in the hyphal form of &quot;C. albicans&quot;. Hwp1 is a mammalian transglutaminase substrate. This host enzyme allows &quot;Candida albicans&quot; to attach stably to host epithelial cells. Adhesion of &quot;C. albicans&quot; to host cells is an essential first step in the infection process for colonization and subsequent induction of mucosal infection.

===Slr1===
The RNA-binding protein Slr1 plays a role in instigating hyphal formation and virulence in &quot;C. albicans&quot;.

===Candidalysin===
Candidalysin is a cytolytic 31-amino acid α-helical peptide toxin that is released by &quot;C. albicans&quot; during hyphal formation. It contributes to virulence during mucosal infections.

===PRA1===
During vaginal infections PRA1 (pH-regulated antigen) gene is up-regulated. Its expression correlates with the concentration of proinflammatory cytokines. 
==Genetic and genomic tools==

Due to its nature as a model organism, being an important human pathogen and the alternative codon usage (CUG translated into serine rather than leucine), several specific projects and tools have been created to study &quot;C. albicans&quot;. The diploid nature and the absence of a sexual cycle make the organism difficult to study, but in the last 20 years, many systems have been developed to observe its genetics.

===Selection markers===
The selection markers most used in &quot;C. albicans&quot; are the CaNAT1 resistance marker (confers resistance against nourseothricin) and MPAr or IMH3r (confers resistance to mycophenolic acid).
Next to the above-mentioned selection makers a few auxotrophic strains were generated to work with auxotrophic makers. The URA3 marker (URA3 blaster method) is an often-used strategy in uridine auxotrophic strains; however, studies have shown that differences in URA3 position in the genome can be involved in the pathogeny of &quot;C. albicans&quot;. Besides the URA3 selection one can also use the histidine, leucine and arginine autotrophy. The advantage of using those autotrophies lies in the fact that they exhibit wild-type or nearly wild-type virulence in a mouse model compared to the URA3 system. One application of the leucine, arginine and histidine autotrophy is for example the candida two-hybrid system.

===Full sequence genome===

The full genome of &quot;C. albicans&quot; has been sequenced and made publicly available in a Candida database. The heterozygous diploid strain used for this full genome sequence project is the laboratory strain SC5314. The sequencing was done using a whole-genome shotgun approach.

===ORFeome project===

Every predicted ORF has been created in a gateway adapted vector (pDONR207) and made publicly available. The vectors (plasmids) can be propagated in &quot;E.coli&quot; and grown on LB+gentamicin medium. This way every ORF is readily available in an easy to use vector. Using the gateway system it is possible to transfer the ORF of interest to any other gateway adapted vector for further studies of the specific ORF.

===CIp10 integrative plasmid===

Contrary to the yeast &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; episomal plasmids do not stay stable in &quot;C. albicans&quot;. In order to work with plasmids in &quot;C. albicans&quot; an integrative approach (plasmid integration into the genome) thus has to be used. A second problem is that most plasmid transformations are rather inefficient in &quot;C. albicans&quot;; however, the CIp10 plasmid overcomes these problems and can be used with ease to transform &quot;C. albicans&quot; in a very efficient way. The plasmid integrates inside the RP10 locus as disruption of one RP10 allele does not seem to affect the viability and growth of &quot;C. albicans&quot;. Several adaptations of this plasmid have been made after the original became available.

===Candida two-hybrid (C2H) system===

Due to the aberrant codon usage of &quot;C. albicans&quot; it is less feasible to use the common host organism (&quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;) for two-hybrid studies. To overcome this problem a &quot;C. albicans&quot; two-hybrid (C2H) system was created. The strain SN152 that is auxotrophic for leucine, arginine and histidine was used to create this C2H system. It was adapted by integrating a HIS1 reporter gene preceded by five LexAOp sequences.
In the C2H system the bait plasmid (pC2HB) contains the &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; LexA BD, while the prey plasmid (pC2HP) harbors the viral AD VP16. Both plasmids are integrative plasmids since episomal plasmids do not stay stable in &quot;C. albicans&quot;. The reporter gene used in the system is the &quot;HIS1&quot; gene. When proteins interact, the cells will be able to grow on medium lacking histidine due to the activation of the &quot;HIS1&quot; reporter gene. Several interactions have thus far been detected using this system in a low scale set up. A first high-throughput screening has also been performed. Interacting proteins can be found at the BioGRID.

===Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC)===

Besides the C2H system, a BiFC system has been developed to study protein-protein interactions in &quot;C. albicans&quot;. With this systems protein interactions can be studied in their native sub cellular location contrary to a C2H system in which the proteins are forced into the nucleus. With BiFC one can study for example protein interactions that take place at the cell membrane or vacuolar membrane.

===Microarrays===
Both DNA and protein microarrays were designed to study DNA expression profiles and antibody production in patients against &quot;C. albicans&quot; cell wall proteins.

===GRACE library===

Using a tetracycline-regulatable promoter system a gene replacement and conditional expression (GRACE) library was created for 1,152 genes. By using the regulatable promoter and having deleted 1 of the alleles of the specific gene it was possible to discriminate between non-essential and essential genes. Of the tested 1,152 genes 567 showed to be essential. The knowledge on essential genes can be used to discover novel antifungals.

===CRISPR/Cas9===

CRISPR/Cas9 has been adapted to be used in &quot;C. albicans&quot;. Several studies have been performed using this system.

==Application in engineering==
&quot;C. albicans&quot; has been used in combination with carbon nanotubes (CNT) to produce stable electrically conductive bio-nano-composite tissue materials that have been used as temperature-sensing elements.

<doc id="411679" wikidata="Q498596" url="?curid=411679" title="Duderstadt">
<text>Duderstadt () is a city in southern Lower Saxony, Germany, located in the district of Göttingen.

It is the centre and the capital of the northern part of the Eichsfeld (&quot;Untereichsfeld&quot;). It was once the private wealth of the Roman Catholic archbishop of Mainz.

The earliest documentary mention of Duderstadt was in 929 AD, and the city celebrates its anniversaries counting from that year.

It is located on the German Timber-Frame Road.

==Architecture==
The city contains many historical buildings in the half-timber style, most notably along the Market Street, which stretches from the St. Cyriakuskirche (Catholic, built 1250–1490), also called &quot;Oberkirche&quot; (upper church), down to the St. Servatiuskirche (Protestant, built 1370–1520), also called &quot;Unterkirche&quot; (nether church).

Built in 1343, the Westerturm is one of at least eight gate towers and peels of the city&#x27;s fortress wall, it burned down in 1424 and was rebuilt over the course of 12 years. The Westerturm has a very distinctive twisted roof. Though not the only tower in Germany with a twisted roof, its execution was particularly successful. There are a number of folk tales to explain the twist: one tale claims that an unoiled weather vane caused the wind to twist the roof. Another claims that when the devil was driving the men of Duderstadt to drink, the women drove him away, but not before he grabbed the tower and twisted it while passing over the wall, making his escape.

Construction of the Rathaus (city council building) began in 1302, with additional wings and components added until 1674. It was completely restored in the 1980s and most recently in 2002. At particular hours, a carillon plays from one of the towers as a bust of the &quot;Anreis&quot; (also: &quot;Anreischke&quot;) comes out and nods.

==The &quot;Anreischke&quot;==
The city &quot;Innenstadt&quot; is surrounded by a long earthen wall which was constructed by a traveling master fortress builder named Andreas. The city council (&quot;Rat&quot;) of Duderstadt contracted with Andreas in 1506 to build the wall. Since the surrounding farmers were also to be protected by the wall, the &quot;Rat&quot; conscripted them to work on the construction of the wall. Andreas was reportedly a cruel taskmaster, and the farmers detested him. They soon also blamed the citizens of Duderstadt for their woes, and took to calling all of them &quot;Anreischke&quot;, after Andreas, which was pronounced &quot;Anreis&quot; in the &quot;platt&quot; (low) German spoken by the farmers.

The citizens of Duderstadt, in turn, had a wooden bust of Andreas constructed and attached to a clockwork. Every two hours since then, the wooden &quot;Anreischke&quot; would come out and nod to the farmers coming to market, to remind them of the detested Andreas, and of their dependency on the city.

That wooden Anreischke nods until this day from the Rathaus tower at 9 am, 11, 1 pm, 3, 5 and 7.

==Otto Bock==
A Duderstadt-headquartered company is the Otto Bock corporation, named after its founder. Otto Bock produces state-of-the-art prosthetic limbs and other health products. Though now an international company, it is still headquartered in Duderstadt. Revenue in 2003 was 355.5 million euros. Otto Bock was a significant contributor to economic growth in the region in the postwar period.
==Culture==
The Duderstadt Heimatmuseum has a collection of locally significant artifacts. Exhibitions include temporary ones and a room with a glass floor installed in the late twentieth century so that visitors can see the original stone wall construction underneath the building.

Not far from Duderstadt, the Borderland Museum Eichsfeld in Teistungen addresses various aspects of the inner-German border, the German division and the history of the GDR. The museum area also includes a circular hiking trail along the former Iron Curtain.

==Notable people==
* Georg von Kopp (1837–1914), Cardinal of the RC Church; Bishop of Fulda (1881–1887) and Prince-Bishop of Breslau (1887–1914).
* Theodor Barth (1849–1909), politician, member of the Reichstag 
* Angela Zigahl (1885–1955), teacher and politician, died locally
* Tilo Medek (1940–2006), a German classical composer, musicologist and music publisher; died locally

<doc id="411680" wikidata="Q439681" url="?curid=411680" title="Ban Gu">
<text>Ban Gu (AD32–92) was a Chinese historian, poet, and politician best known for his part in compiling the &quot;Book of Han&quot;, the second of China&#x27;s 24 dynastic histories. He also wrote a number of &quot;fu&quot;, a major literary form, part prose and part poetry, which is particularly associated with the Han era. A number of Ban&#x27;s &quot;fu&quot; were collected by Xiao Tong in the &quot;Wen Xuan&quot;.

==Family background==
The Ban family was one of the most distinguished families of the Eastern Han dynasty. They lived in the state of Chu during the Warring States period but, during the reign of the First Emperor, a man named Ban Yi ( or &quot;Bān Yī&quot;) fled north to the Loufan ( &quot;Lóufán&quot;) near the Yanmen Pass in what is now northern Shanxi Province. By the early Han Dynasty, Ban Gu&#x27;s ancestors gained prominence on the northwestern frontier as herders of several thousand cattle, oxen, and horses, which they traded in a formidable business and encouraged other families to move to the frontier. Ban Biao later moved the family to Anling (near modern Xianyang, Shaanxi).

Ban Gu&#x27;s great-aunt Consort Ban was a scholar and poet, and his father Ban Biao was a prominent historian. He took over from his father responsibility for writing a history of the former Han dynasty, a book known in modern times as the &quot;Hanshu&quot; or &quot;Book of Han&quot;. However, his work was interrupted by political problems, as his association with the family of Empress Dowager Dou led to his imprisonment and death (either by execution or torture). A few volumes of his book in 13–20th (eight chronological charts) and 26th (astronomical biography), however, was completed by his younger sister, Ban Zhao, and became a model for many other works about later dynasties.

Ban Gu&#x27;s grandmother on the paternal side was Xiongnu and was a descendant of the Xiongnu king Xiutu. The partly Xiongnu origins of Ban Gu might help explain his skills in matters related to China&#x27;s history and foreign relations.

Ban&#x27;s twin brother Ban Chao was a famous military leader and explorer of Central Asia. His sister, Ban Zhao, was one of the most famous female scholars in Chinese history, and contributed to the &quot;Han Shu&quot;, after Ban Gu&#x27;s imprisonment and subsequent death.

==Life==
Ban&#x27;s father, Ban Biao, died in AD54 when Ban was twenty-two. After his father&#x27;s death, Ban spent a period of time pondering what path he should pursue in life, eventually composing a long &quot;fu&quot; on his situation entitled &quot;&quot;Fu&quot; on Communicating with the Hidden&quot; (), which is famous as one of the earliest known &quot;fu&quot; used to discuss philosophical questions. Ban did not immediately begin an official career, but remained in the Ban family home in Anling to work on the completion of his father&#x27;s historical sequel to Sima Qian&#x27;s &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;.

Around AD60, rumors were reported to Emperor Ming of Han that Ban was &quot;privately revising the national history&quot;, which caused the imperial court to become concerned about the type of account Ban would write of the fall of the Western Han and the rise of the Eastern Han. Ban was subsequently arrested and the Ban family library confiscated, though Ban&#x27;s brother Ban Chao was able to intercede on his behalf and secure Ban&#x27;s release. Ban was assigned to compile the annals of Emperor Guangwu of Han, the first Eastern Han emperor, and in AD64 was assigned to the collation of books in the imperial library and promoted to the rank of gentleman. Emperor Ming was so impressed with the quality of Ban&#x27;s work that in AD66 he gave him permission to resume his work on the history of the Western Han, which he worked on for the rest of his life.

Ban continued to serve in the imperial library and at the imperial court throughout the second half of the 1st century AD. During the reign of Emperor Zhang of Han, Ban was promoted to the position of &quot;Marshal of the Black Warrior Gate&quot;. Ban later served as a high-ranking literary official under Dou Xian, the brother of Emperor Zhang&#x27;s empress. Although Dou won prestige for two successful campaigns against the Xiongnu, in AD92 he was suspected by Emperor He of Han of plotting a rebellion and forced to commit suicide. Immediately thereafter, Ban was dismissed from office and arrested by an old rival, Chong Jing, who was serving as the prefect of Luoyang. Ban died in prison that same year at 61 years old.

==Legacy==

The modern historian Hsu Mei-ling states that Ban Gu&#x27;s written work in geography set the trend for the establishment of geographical sections of history texts, and most likely sparked the trend of the gazetteer in ancient China.

The tendency of both Chinese and Western scholars to view China&#x27;s history in a dynastic framework is thought to be a direct result of Ban Gu&#x27;s decision to write the Book of Han in the manner in which he did.

<doc id="411682" wikidata="Q659584" url="?curid=411682" title="Molluscum contagiosum">
<text>Molluscum contagiosum (MC), sometimes called water warts, is a viral infection of the skin that results in small raised pink lesions with a dimple in the center. They may become itchy or sore, and occur singularly or in groups. Any area of the skin may be affected, with abdomen, legs, arms, neck, genital area, and face being the most common. Onset of the lesions is around seven weeks after infection. They usually go away within a year without scarring.
The infection is caused by a poxvirus called the &quot;molluscum contagiosum virus&quot; (MCV). The virus is spread either by direct contact, including sexual activity, or via contaminated objects such as towels. The condition can also be spread to other areas of the body by the person themselves. Risk factors include a weak immune system, atopic dermatitis, and crowded living conditions. Following one infection, it is possible to get re-infected. Diagnosis is typically based on the appearance of the lesions.
Prevention includes hand washing and not sharing personal items. While treatment is not necessary, some may wish to have the lesions removed for cosmetic reasons or to prevent spread. Removal may occur with freezing, laser therapy, or opening up the lesion and scraping the inside. Scraping the lesion can, however, result in scarring. The oral medication cimetidine, or podophyllotoxin cream applied to the skin, may also be used for treatment.
Approximately 122 million people globally were affected by molluscum contagiosum as of 2010 (1.8% of the population). It is more common in children between the ages of one and ten years old. The condition has become more common in the United States since 1966. Having an infection is not a reason to keep a child out of school or daycare.
==Signs and symptoms==

Molluscum contagiosum lesions are flesh-colored, dome-shaped, and pearly in appearance. They are often 1–5 mm in diameter, with a dimpled center. Molluscum lesions are most commonly found on the face, arms, legs, torso, and armpits in children. Adults typically have molluscum lesions in the genital region and this is considered to be a sexually transmitted infection; because of this, if genital lesions are found on a child, sexual abuse should be suspected. These lesions are generally not painful, but they may itch or become irritated. Picking or scratching the bumps may lead to a spread of the viral infection responsible for molluscum contagiosum, an additional bacterial infection, and scarring. In some cases, eczema develops around the lesions.

Individual molluscum lesions may go away on their own within two months and generally clear completely without treatment or scarring in six to twelve months. Mean durations for an outbreak are variously reported from eight to about 18 months, but durations are reported as widely as six months to five years, lasting longer in immunosuppressed individuals.

==Transmission==
As the name implies, molluscum contagiosum is extremely contagious. Transmission of the molluscum contagiosum virus can occur many different ways including direct skin contact (e.g., contact sports or sexual activity), contact with an infected surface (fomite), or autoinoculation (self-infection) by scratching or picking molluscum lesions and then touching other parts of the skin not previously affected by the virus. Children are particularly susceptible to autoinoculation and may have widespread clusters of lesions. The viral infection is limited to a localized area on the topmost layer of the superficial layer of the skin.

==Diagnosis==
Histologically, molluscum contagiosum is characterized by &quot;molluscum bodies&quot; (also known as Henderson-Patterson bodies) in the epidermis, above the &quot;stratum basale&quot;, which consist of cells with abundant large granular eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusion bodies (accumulated virions) and a small nucleus that has been pushed to the periphery.

==Management==
Because molluscum contagiosum usually resolves without treatment and treatment options can cause discomfort to children, initial recommendations are often to simply wait for the lesions to resolve on their own. Of the treatments available, a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials suggested that there is no difference between treatments in short term improvement, and no single treatment is significantly better than natural resolution of the condition.

Bumps located in the genital area may be treated in an effort to prevent them from spreading. When treatment has resulted in the elimination of all bumps, the infection has been effectively cured and will not reappear unless the person is reinfected.

===Medications===
For mild cases, over-the-counter topical medication, such as potassium hydroxide may provide a modest benefit. There is limited evidence for other topical agents including salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and tretinoin, but none of these agents are recommended above the others to shorten infection duration.

Studies have found cantharidin to be an effective and safe treatment for removing molluscum contagiosum. This medication is usually well tolerated though mild side effects such as pain or blistering are common.
There is no high-quality evidence for cimetidine. However, oral cimetidine has been used as an alternative treatment for the pediatric population as it is generally well tolerated and less invasive.

====Imiquimod====
Imiquimod is a form of immunotherapy initially proposed as a treatment for molluscum based on promising results in small case series and clinical trials. However, two large randomized controlled trials, specifically requested by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act both demonstrated that imiquimod cream applied three times per week was no more effective than placebo cream for treating molluscum after 18 weeks of treatment in a total of 702 children aged 2–12 years. In 2007, results from those trials—which remain unpublished—were incorporated into FDA-approved prescribing information for imiquimod, which states: &quot;Limitations of Use: Efficacy was not demonstrated for molluscum contagiosum in children aged 2–12.&quot; In 2007, the FDA also updated imiquimod&#x27;s label concerning safety issues raised in the two large trials and an FDA-requested pharmacokinetic study (the latter of which was published). The updated safety label reads as follows:
* Potential adverse effects of imiquimod use: &quot;Similar to the studies conducted in adults, the most frequently reported adverse reaction from 2 studies in children with molluscum contagiosum was application site reaction. Adverse events which occurred more frequently in Aldara-treated subjects compared with vehicle-treated subjects generally resembled those seen in studies in indications approved for adults and also included otitis media (5% Aldara vs. 3% vehicle) and conjunctivitis (3% Aldara vs. 2% vehicle). Erythema was the most frequently reported local skin reaction. Severe local skin reactions reported by Aldara-treated subjects in the pediatric studies included erythema (28%), edema (8%), scabbing/crusting (5%), flaking/scaling (5%), erosion (2%) and weeping/exudate (2%).&quot;
* Potential systemic absorption of imiquimod, with negative effects on white blood cell counts overall, and specifically neutrophil counts: &quot;Among the 20 subjects with evaluable laboratory assessments, the median WBC count decreased by 1.4*109/L and the median absolute neutrophil count decreased by 1.42 L−1.&quot;

===Surgery===
Surgical treatments include cryosurgery, in which liquid nitrogen is used to freeze and destroy lesions, as well as scraping them off with a curette. Application of liquid nitrogen may cause burning or stinging at the treated site, which may persist for a few minutes after the treatment. With liquid nitrogen, a blister may form at the treatment site, but it will slough off in two to four weeks. Cryosurgery and curette scraping can be painful procedures and can result in residual scarring.

===Laser===
A 2014 systematic review of case reports and case series concluded that the limited available data suggest pulsed dye laser therapy is a safe and effective treatment for molluscum contagiosum and is generally well tolerated by children. Side effects seen with pulsed dye laser therapy included mild temporary pain at the site of therapy, bruising (lasting up to 2–3 weeks), and temporary discoloration of the treated skin (as long as 1–6 months). No cases of permanent scarring have been reported. As of 2009, however, there is no evidence for genital lesions.

==Prognosis==
Most cases of molluscum contagiosum will clear up naturally within two years (usually within nine months). So long as the skin growths are present, there is a possibility of transmitting the infection to another person. When the growths are gone, the possibility of spreading the infection is ended.

Unlike herpesviruses, which can remain inactive in the body for months or years before reappearing, molluscum contagiosum does not remain in the body when the growths are gone from the skin and will not reappear on their own.

==Epidemiology==
As of 2010, approximately 122 million people were affected worldwide by molluscum contagiosum (1.8% of the population).

<doc id="411683" wikidata="Q145273" url="?curid=411683" title="Polyamide">
<text>A polyamide is a polymer with repeating units linked by amide bonds.

Polyamides occur both naturally and artificially. Examples of naturally occurring polyamides are proteins, such as wool and silk. Artificially made polyamides can be made through step-growth polymerization or solid-phase synthesis yielding materials such as nylons, aramids, and sodium polyaspartate. Synthetic polyamides are commonly used in textiles, automotive industry, carpets, kitchen utensils and sportswear due to their high durability and strength. The transportation manufacturing industry is the major consumer, accounting for 35% of polyamide (PA) consumption.

==Classification==
Polymers of amino acids are known as polypeptides or proteins.

According to the composition of their main chain, synthetic polyamides are classified as follows:

All polyamides are made by the formation of an amide function to link two molecules of monomer together. The monomers can be amides themselves (usually in the form of a cyclic lactam such as caprolactam), α,ω-amino acids or a stoichiometric mixture of a diamine and a diacid. Both these kinds of precursors give a homopolymer. Polyamides are easily copolymerized, and thus many mixtures of monomers are possible which can in turn lead to many copolymers. Additionally many nylon polymers are miscible with one another allowing the creation of blends.

==Polymerization chemistry==
Production of polymers requires the repeated joining of two groups to form an amide linkage. In this case this specifically involves amide bonds, and the two groups involved are an amine group, and a terminal carbonyl component of a functional group. These react to produce a carbon-nitrogen bond, creating a singular amide linkage. This process involves the elimination of other atoms previously part of the functional groups. The carbonyl-component may be part of either a carboxylic acid group or the more reactive acyl halide derivative. The amine group and the carboxylic acid group can be on the same monomer, or the polymer can be constituted of two different bifunctional monomers, one with two amine groups, the other with two carboxylic acid or acid chloride groups.

The condensation reaction is used to synthetically produce nylon polymers in industry. Nylons must specifically include a straight chain (aliphatic) monomer. The amide link is produced from an amine group (alternatively known as an amino group), and a carboxylic acid group. The hydroxyl from the carboxylic acid combines with a hydrogen from the amine, and gives rise to water, the elimination byproduct that is the namesake of the reaction. 

As an example of condensation reactions, consider that in living organisms, amino acids are condensed with one another by an enzyme to form amide linkages (known as peptides). The resulting polyamides are known as proteins or polypeptides. In the diagram below, consider the amino-acids as single aliphatic monomers reacting with identical molecules to form a polyamide, focusing on solely the amine and acid groups. Ignore the substituent R groups – under the assumption the difference between the R groups are negligible:

For fully aromatic polyamides or &quot;aramids&quot; e.g. Kevlar, the more reactive acyl chloride is used as a monomer. The polymerization reaction with the amine group eliminates hydrogen chloride. The acid chloride route can be used as a laboratory synthesis to avoid heating and obtain an almost instantaneous reaction. The aromatic moiety itself does not participate in elimination reaction, but it does increase the rigidity and strength of the resulting material which leads to Kevlar&#x27;s renowned strength.

In the diagram below, an aramid is made from two different monomers which continuously alternate to form the polymer chain. Aramids are aromatic polyamides:

Polyamides can also be synthesized from dinitriles using acid catalysis via an application of the Ritter reaction. This method is applicable for preparation of nylon 1,6 from adiponitrile, formaldehyde and water. Additionally, polyamides can be synthesized from glycols and dinitriles using this method as well.

<doc id="411687" wikidata="Q1416773" url="?curid=411687" title="Granuloma inguinale">
<text>Granuloma inguinale is a bacterial disease caused by &quot;Klebsiella granulomatis&quot; (formerly known as &quot;Calymmatobacterium granulomatis&quot;) characterized by genital ulcers. It is endemic in many less-developed regions. It is also known as donovanosis, granuloma genitoinguinale, granuloma inguinale tropicum, granuloma venereum, granuloma venereum genitoinguinale, lupoid form of groin ulceration, serpiginous ulceration of the groin,ulcerating granuloma of the pudendum, and ulcerating sclerosing granuloma. Oral manifestations are also notably seen. The lesions of oral cavity are usually secondary to active genital lesions.

The disease often goes untreated because of the scarcity of medical treatment in the countries in which it is found. In addition, the painless genital ulcers can be mistaken for syphilis. The ulcers ultimately progress to destruction of internal and external tissue, with extensive leakage of mucus and blood from the highly vascular lesions. The destructive nature of donovanosis also increases the risk of superinfection by other pathogenic microbes.

==Symptoms and signs==

Small, painless nodules appear after about 10–40 days of contact with the bacteria. Later, the nodules burst, creating open, fleshy red ulcers with rolled edges that have a tendency to bleed on contact. The infection spreads, mutilating the infected tissue. The infection will continue to destroy the tissue until treated, lesions can spread by autoinoculation. Inguinal spread can lead to the formation of pseudobubo without the involvement of the inguinal lymph nodes. The lesions frequently occur at the region of contact typically found on the shaft of the penis, the labia, or the perineum, and in the oral region due to oral intercourse. Rarely, the vaginal wall or cervix is the site of the lesion. At least one case in India led to partial autoamputation of the penis. The patient tested positive for HIV-2 and had been infected for six years.
Genital elephantiasis can occur because of the blockage of the lymphatic channels due to scarring of the ulcers. There is concern that there is a linkage between donovanosis and squamous cell carcinoma.

==Mechanism==
The microorganism spreads from one host to another through contact with the open sores.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis is based on the patient&#x27;s sexual history and on physical examination revealing a painless, &quot;beefy-red ulcer&quot; with a characteristic rolled edge of granulation tissue. In contrast to syphilitic ulcers, inguinal lymphadenopathy is generally mild or absent. Tissue biopsy and Wright-Giemsa stain are used to aid in the diagnosis. The presence of Donovan bodies in the tissue sample confirms donovanosis. Donovan bodies are rod-shaped, oval organisms that can be seen in the cytoplasm of mononuclear phagocytes or histiocytes in tissue samples from patients with granuloma inguinale.

They appear deep purple when stained with Wright&#x27;s stain. These intracellular inclusions are the encapsulated Gram-negative rods of the causative organisms. They were discovered by Charles Donovan.

===Classification===
The first known name for this condition was &quot;serpiginous ulcer&quot;, which dates to 1882. The proper clinical designation for donovanosis is &quot;granuloma inguinale&quot;. A granuloma is a nodular type of inflammatory reaction, and inguinale refers to the inguinal region, which is commonly involved in this infection. The disease is commonly known as donovanosis, after the Donovan bodies seen on microscopy, which are a diagnostic sign.

The causative organism, &quot;Klebsiella granulomatis&quot;, was called &quot;Calymmatobacterium granulomatis&quot;, and some sources still use this classification, from the Greek &quot;kalymma&quot; (a hood or veil), referring to the lesions that contain the bacteria. Prior to this, it was called &quot;Donovania granulomatis&quot;, named after the Donovan bodies.

The specific name &quot;granulomatis&quot; refers to the granulomatous lesions. The organism was recently reclassified under the genus &quot;Klebsiella&quot;, a drastic taxonomic change since it involved changing the organism&#x27;s phylum. However, polymerase chain reaction techniques using a colorimetric detection system showed a 99% similarity with other species in the genus &quot;Klebsiella&quot;. The clinical appearances of this lesion orally are classified into three types: Ulcerative, exuberant, cicatricial.

==Prevention==
The disease is effectively treated with antibiotics, therefore, developed countries have a very low incidence of donovanosis; about 100 cases are reported each year in the United States. However, sexual contact with individuals in endemic regions dramatically increases the risk of contracting the disease. Using condoms, sexually transmitted infection testing before beginning a sexual relationship, and avoidance of these sexual contacts are effective preventative measures for donovanosis.

==Treatment==
Recommended regimen is azithromycin 1 gram oral/IV once per week, alternatively doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day or ciprofloxacin 750 mg orally twice a day or erythromycin base 500 mg orally four times a day or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole one double-strength (160 mg/800 mg) tablet orally twice a day. All antibiotic regimens should last for at least 3 weeks and until all lesions have completely healed. Association with gentamicin is sometimes used in severe cases, specially in cases of AIDS. Normally, the infection will begin to subside within a week of treatment, but the full treatment period must be followed to minimize the possibility of relapse.
Sporadic surgical ressection of the lesions has been used in extensive perineal fistulae refractory to pharmacological 
intervention.
The CDC 2015 guidelines give azithromycin as the antibiotic of choice.

<doc id="411692" wikidata="Q1277793" url="?curid=411692" title="Myotonia">
<text>Myotonia is a symptom of a small handful of certain neuromuscular disorders characterized by delayed relaxation (prolonged contraction) of the skeletal muscles after voluntary contraction or electrical stimulation, and the muscle shows an abnormal EMG.

Myotonia is the defining symptom of many channelopathies (diseases of ion channel transport) such as myotonia congenita, paramyotonia congenita and myotonic dystrophy. 

Brody disease (a disease of ion pump transport) has symptoms similar to myotonia congenita, however, the delayed muscle relaxation is pseudo-myotonia as the EMG is normal. Other diseases that exhibit pseudo-myotonia are myositis, glycogen storage diseases, hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, root disease, anterior horn cell disorders, Isaacs syndrome, and Hoffmann syndrome. 

Generally, repeated contraction of the muscle can alleviate the myotonia and relax the muscles thus improving the condition, however, this is not the case in paramyotonia congenita. This phenomenon is known as the &quot;warm-up&quot; reflex and is not to be confused with warming up before exercise, though they may appear similar. Individuals with the disorder may have trouble releasing their grip on objects or may have difficulty rising from a sitting position and a stiff, awkward gait.

Myotonia can affect all muscle groups; however, the pattern of affected muscles can vary depending on the specific disorder involved.

People with disorders involving myotonia can have life-threatening reactions to certain anaesthetics called anaesthesia-induced rhabdomyolysis.

==Causes==
Myotonia may present in the following diseases, with different causes related to the ion channels in the skeletal muscle fiber membrane (sarcolemma).

===Myotonic dystrophy===
Two documented types, DM1 and DM2 exist. In myotonic dystrophy a nucleotide expansion of either of two genes, related to type of disease, results in failure of correct expression (splicing of the mRNA) of the ClC-1 ion channel, due to accumulation of RNA in the cytosol of the cell. The ClC-1 ion channel is responsible for the major part of chloride conductance in the skeletal muscle cell, and lack of sufficient chloride conductance may result in myotonia, (see myotonia congenita). When the splicing of the mRNA was corrected in vitro, ClC-1 channel function was greatly improved and myotonia was abolished.

===Myotonia congenita===
(Congenital myotonia) of which two types called Becker&#x27;s disease and Thomsen&#x27;s disease exist. Both diseases are caused by mutations in the gene CLCN1 encoding the ClC-1 ion channel. More than 130 different mutations exist in total, and a large phenotypic variation is therefore present in this disease. The mutations are loss-of-function mutations that render the ClC-1 ion channel dysfunctional to varying degrees, with reduced chloride conductance as a result. Reduced chloride conductance may result in myotonia, due to accumulation of potassium in the transverse-tubules in skeletal muscle (see myotonia congenita). This is the same genetic disease that makes certain strains of North American goats faint when scared.

Symptoms of myotonia (documented in myotonia congenita) are more frequently experienced in women during pregnancy.

Myotonia could be caused by genetic mutations in the SCN4A gene that encodes the skeletal muscle sodium channel subtype 4 (Nav1.4). Some studies have suggested that changes in physiological pH could have modulatory effects on Nav1.4 sodium channels, which could have manifestations in myotonic phenotypes.

===Paramyotonia congenita===
This disease results from mutation in the gene encoding the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.4 in skeletal muscle fiber membrane. Mutations may alter the kinetics of the channel, such that the channel fails to inactivate properly, thus allowing spontaneous action potentials to occur after voluntary activity has terminated, prolonging relaxation of the muscle, or can result in paralysis if the relaxation is severely prolonged (see SCN4A). This inability of muscles to relax worsening with exercise is often termed &quot;paradoxical myotonia.&quot; Paramyotonia also frequently triggered by exercise, cold, and potassium.

=== Potassium-aggravated myotonia ===
Potassium-aggravated myotonia (PAM) results from in a mututation of the &quot;SCN4A&quot; gene that causes skeletal muscles to be unable to relax after contracting in bouts, typically following the consumption of potassium rich food. It is debated if potassium-aggravated myotonia is a distinct disease from Paramyotonia Congenita, and recent academic papers have classified it both ways.

=== Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis ===
Also known as HyperKPP. Similar to Paramyotonia Congenita, where potassium exacerbates myotonia in many phenotypes, Hyperkalemic Periodic Paralysis is another disorder of the SCN4A gene where high blood potassium levels result in muscle weakness, muscle paralysis (through weakness or through over excitation preventing movement), and sometimes myotonia. Many phenotypes of HyperKPP result in issues regulating blood potassium levels, often cause it to be high or causing hyperkalemia, further exacerbating the condition.

=== Hypokalemic periodic paralysis ===
Also known as HypoKPP. Similar to HyperKPP above, except that it&#x27;s triggered by (and often causes) low potassium levels and hypokalemia. It too can result in myotonia, in addition to weakness and paralysis (from both lack of and excess signal to muscles). It also has been found to occur due to gene mutations in the calcium channel gene CACNA1S and, less frequently, in the SCN4A gene.

=== Neuromyotonia ===
Neuromyotonia (also known as Isaac&#x27;s Syndrome or NMT) causes peripheral nerve hyperexcitability that causes spontaneous muscular activity resulting from repetitive motor unit action potentials of peripheral origin. 100-200 cases have been reported.

=== Other ===
Myotonia occurs also in certain types of limb-girdle muscular dystrophies, myofibrillary myopathies, distal myopathies, and inclusion body myopathies. Other channelopathies may cause it as well. It is also associated with Schwartz–Jampel syndrome.

<text>The Congress of the Union (, ), formally known as the General Congress of the United Mexican States (&quot;Congreso General de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos&quot;), is the legislature of the federal government of Mexico. It consists of two chambers: the Senate of the Republic and the Chamber of Deputies. Its 628 members (128 senators and 500 deputies) meet in Mexico City.

== Structure ==

The Congress is a bicameral body, consisting of two chambers: the Senate of the Republic and the Chamber of Deputies. Its structure and responsibilities are defined in the Third Title, Second Chapter, Articles 50 to 79 of the 1917 Constitution. The upper chamber is the Senate, &quot;Cámara de Senadores&quot; or &quot;Senado&quot;. It comprises 128 seats: 96 members are elected by plurality vote, with three members being elected in each state (two seats are awarded to the winning party or coalition and one to the first runner-up); the other 32 members are elected by proportional representation in a single country-wide constituency. Senators serve six-year terms.

The lower house is the Chamber of Deputies, or &quot;Cámara de Diputados&quot;. It has 500 seats; 300 members are elected by plurality vote and the other 200 members are elected according to proportional representation (PR), through a system of regional lists (one for each of the five constituencies established for the election by law). Deputies serve three-year terms.

The 200 PR seats are distributed generally without taking into account the 300 plurality seats (parallel voting). Since 1996, however, a party cannot get more seats overall than 8% above its result for the PR seats (a party must win 42% of the votes for the PR seats to achieve an overall majority).

There are two exceptions to that rule. A party can lose only PR seats by that rule (not plurality seats). Also, a party cannot get more than 300 seats overall (even if it has more than 52% of the votes for the PR seats).

== Powers ==
The powers invested in Congress are defined in article 73 of the Constitution. Among its powers, Congress can admit new States into the Union, alter the allocation of powers granted to the federal government, lay and collect taxes, declare war (upon request of the Government), provide for and maintain the Union&#x27;s armed forces, and coordinate economic activities.

Article 74, 75 and 76 of the Constitution state that each Chamber can address specific matters. In fact, some powers are reserved either to the Chamber of Deputies or to the Chamber of Senators, making the Congress of the Union an example of imperfect bicameralism. For example, the former can approve the federal budget submitted by the Government, while the latter has the power to analyze the foreign policy of the Government, approve or dismiss the Presidential nominations of the Attorney General, Supreme Court Justices, diplomatic agents, general consuls, and senior civil and military officials.

==Permanent Committee==
The &quot;&quot;, translated variously as the Permanent Committee or Standing Committee, is a body of 19 deputies and 18 senators that is responsible for tasks relating to the Congress when it is in recess.

==Term==
It is conventional to refer to each Legislature by the Roman numeral of its term. Thus, the current Congress (whose term lasts from 2024 to 2027) is known as the &quot;LXVI Legislature&quot;; the previous Congress (whose term lasted from 2018 to 2021) was the &quot;LXIV Legislature&quot;, and so forth. The I Legislature of Congress was the one that met right after the Constituent Congress that enacted the 1857 Constitution.

Early in the 20th century, the revolutionary leader Francisco I. Madero popularized the slogan &quot;Sufragio Efectivo – no Reelección&quot; (&quot;Effective suffrage, no reelection&quot;). In keeping with that long-held principle, and until 2014, the 1917 Constitution stated that &quot;Deputies and Senators could not be reelected for the next immediate term&quot;.

===Reelection===
On February 10, 2014, Article 59 of the Mexican Constitution was amended to allow reelection to the legislative bodies for the first time. Starting with the general election of 2018, deputies and senators are allowed to run for reelection. Members of the Chamber of Deputies may serve up to four terms of three years each while members of the Senate may serve two terms of six years each; in total, members of both houses will be allowed to remain in office for a total of 12 years.

<text>Endemol B.V. (stylized in all lowercase) was a Dutch-based media company that produced and distributed multiplatform entertainment content. The company annually produced more than 15,000 hours of programming across scripted and non-scripted genres, including drama, reality TV, comedy, game shows, entertainment, factual and children&#x27;s programming.

Endemol, a global network of operations in more than 30 countries, worked with over 300 broadcasters, digital platforms and licensees worldwide. The business covered development, production, marketing, distribution, franchise management and multi-platform initiatives including digital video, gaming and apps.

Endemol was merged with Shine Group to form Endemol Shine Group (a joint-venture between The Walt Disney Company and Apollo Global Management) and headquartered in the Netherlands in 2015. Since the merger, Endemol is an in-name-only unit of Endemol Shine Group, and in the next years, Endemol&#x27;s iconic eye logo was replaced with Endemol Shine Group&#x27;s wordmark-only logo in the closing credits of most of the shows that it licensed. Endemol created and ran reality, talent and game show franchises worldwide, including &quot;Big Brother&quot;, &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;, &quot;Fear Factor&quot;, &quot;Wipeout&quot;, &quot;The Money Drop&quot;, &quot;Family Feud&quot;, and &quot;Your Face Sounds Familiar&quot;. The company also has a portfolio of drama and comedy series including titles such as &quot;The Fall&quot;, &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot;, &quot;Hell on Wheels&quot;, &quot;Benidorm&quot;, &quot;Ripper Street&quot;, &quot;Black Mirror&quot;, &quot;Bad Education&quot;, &quot;My Mad Fat Diary&quot;, &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot;, &quot;Kirstie&quot;, &quot;Leverage&quot;, &quot;Home and Away&quot;, &quot;Death Comes to Pemberley&quot; and &quot;The Crimson Field&quot;.

== History ==
Endemol was founded in 1994 by a merger of television production companies owned by Joop van den Ende and John de Mol, the name deriving from the combination of their surnames.

On 23 June 1998, Endemol Entertainment had announced that they&#x27;ve entered the British market by acquiring a 50% majority stake in London-based production company Broadcast Communications from the Guardian Media Group.

Endemol has specialised in formatted programming that can be adapted for different countries around the world as well as different media platforms. One notable success has been the &quot;Big Brother&quot; reality television show, with versions in many countries after the initial Dutch version. Other examples include &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; (sold to over 75 countries), &quot;The Money Drop&quot; (sold in over 50 countries), &quot;Fear Factor&quot; (sold in 30 countries) and &quot;Wipeout&quot; (sold in over 30 countries). From 2011 till its absorption by Endemol Shine Group, the company expanded its English language drama output with shows such as &quot;The Fall&quot;, &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot;, &quot;Ripper Street&quot; and &quot;Black Mirror&quot; in the UK and &quot;Hell on Wheels&quot; in the US. In November 2013 the company launched Endemol Beyond, an international division specialising in original content for digital video platforms such as YouTube.

In 2000, Endemol was sold to the Spanish telecom and media corporation Telefónica for €5.5 billion. In November 2005, 25% of Endemol was taken public, and since was listed on the Euronext Amsterdam exchange under the stock symbol EML.

On 30 September 2003, Endemol announced that they had acquired a 51% majority stake in New York-based American reality independent production company True Entertainment with the company continued to be operated and placed with Endemol&#x27;s US division with the latter expanding their international operations.

On 8 December 2006, Endemol announced that they would reacquire their French division Endemol France from their former parent Telefonica. By 9 January 2007, the Dutch-based European entertainment company had made a deal with their former parent company Telefonica to buy back their French outfit which would become a division of the reunited Dutch-based entertainment giant.

On 14 May 2007 the remaining 75% of Endemol shares were bought by a consortium, Edam Acquisition, led by Mediaset, the company controlled by Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s family, and including the investment company Cyrte, in which the original co-founder John de Mol has shares. The consortium announced on 6 August 2007 that it now owned 99.54% of Endemol shares, after an offer to buy the remaining shares went through on 3 August 2007; it asked the Euronext bourse for a delisting of Endemol.

In December 2009, Endemol announced that their German division Endemol Germany had entered drama production by launching a joint-venture with Germany&#x27;s Wiedemann &amp; Berg Film being named Wiedemann &amp; Berg Television with W&amp;B Film founders Quirin Berg and Max Wiedemann overseeing the management and will focus on scripted television series.

It was reported in 2010 that the company was $3 billion in debt. Then in 2011, it was reported that the debt had grown to $4.1 billion.

On 9 August 2010, Endemol announced that they acquired a majority stake in Los Angeles-based American reality production company Authentic Entertainment expanding their operations in the USA.

A loan restructure was planned for 2011 when Endemol was expected to breach its debt covenants. On 30 June, the debt covenants were breached at the same time that CEO Ynon Kreiz left the company and Endemol&#x27;s UK subsidiary failed to file its annual accounts. On 23 March 2012, Endemol&#x27;s debt was converted into shares by US private-equity firm Apollo Global Management. On 3 April 2012, Mediaset sold its majority stake in Endemol to Apollo and Dutch asset manager Cyrte, and Endemol restructured the bulk of its debt. The current CEO is Just Spee. On 15 May 2014, Apollo and 21st Century Fox announced a joint venture to combine 21st Century Fox&#x27;s Shine Group and Apollo&#x27;s Endemol and CORE Media Group. The deal closed October 2014.

Over the years Endemol has expanded its international presence either by starting up operations in new markets or by acquiring existing production companies. Most recently, in December 2013, Endemol became a shareholder in Israel&#x27;s Channel 2 franchisee Reshet, following the acquisition in April of a controlling share in the Israeli independent producer Kuperman, which is now Endemol Israel.

On 17 December 2014, Endemol&#x27;s parent company Apollo Global Management announced that they&#x27;ve completed their merger of Endemol with fellow Apollo subsidiary Core Media, producer of &quot;American Idol&quot;, and 21st Century Fox&#x27;s British-based entertainment production and distribution company Shine unit, with the resulting &#x27;mega-indie&#x27; adopting the name &quot;Endemol Shine Group&quot;, which was a 50:50 joint venture by both parent companies. The name took effect on 1 January 2015. 21st Century Fox&#x27;s predecessor company, Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation, had in 2011 bought Shine (founder and chairperson until the 2015 merger: Murdoch&#x27;s daughter Elisabeth) for $673 million.

<text>The 29th Division, known as the &quot;Incomparable Division&quot;, was an infantry division of the British Army, formed in early 1915 by combining various Regular Army units that had been acting as garrisons around the British Empire. Under the command of Major-General Aylmer Hunter-Weston, the division fought throughout the Gallipoli Campaign, including the original landing at Cape Helles. From 1916 to the end of the war the division fought on the Western Front in Belgium and France.

According to the published divisional history (see reference below), &#x27;The total casualties of the 29th Division amounted to something like 94,000. Gallipoli alone accounted for 34,000. This must be, if not a record, among the highest totals in any division … The number of Victoria Crosses won by members of this division was 27 (12 at Gallipoli). This constitutes a record&#x27;. A large commemorative Portland stone obelisk, built in 1921 to remember the Division&#x27;s review by King George V before they were sent to Gallipoli, is located on a roundabout on the A45 just north of Stretton-on-Dunsmore, Warwickshire. A memorial to the 29th Division is located in Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial. Lieutenant-General Beauvoir De Lisle, wartime commander of the 29th British Division, unveiled the monument the morning of the official opening of the site on 7 June 1925.

== Unit history ==

=== Gallipoli ===

The 29th Division served on the Gallipoli peninsula, a point in the strategic Dardanelles straits between the Black Sea and the Aegean Sea (and thus the Mediterranean). The division was there for the duration of the ill-fated campaign. It made the first landings as part of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force in April 1915. On the morning of 25 April 1915 the Battle of Gallipoli began when battalions from the division&#x27;s 86th and 87th Brigades landed at five beaches around Cape Helles at the tip of the peninsula under the command of Major-General Aylmer Hunter-Weston. Three of the landings faced little or no opposition but were not exploited. The two main landings, at V and W Beaches on either side of the cape, met with fierce Turkish resistance and the landing battalions were decimated.

The original objectives of the first day of the campaign had been the village of Krithia and the nearby hill of Achi Baba. The first concerted attempt to capture these was made by the division three days after the landings on 28 April. In this First Battle of Krithia an advance up the peninsula was made but the division was halted short of its objective and suffered around 3,000 casualties. The attack was resumed on 6 May with the launch of the Second Battle of Krithia. On this occasion the 88th Brigade attacked along Fig Tree Spur and, after two days of fighting without significant progress, it was relieved by the New Zealand Infantry Brigade. On 24 May Major-General Beauvoir De Lisle took over command of the division.

On 4 June the 88th Brigade was once more required to make an advance along Fig Tree Spur in the Third Battle of Krithia. In the subsequent counter-attacks, Second Lieutenant G.R.D Moor of the 2nd Hampshires was awarded the Victoria Cross for shooting four of his own men who attempted to retreat.

The division finally saw successful fighting at Helles during the Battle of Gully Ravine on 28 June when the 86th Brigade managed to advance along Gully Spur. As a prelude to the launch of the August Offensive, a &quot;diversion&quot; was carried out at Helles on 6 August to prevent the Turks withdrawing troops. In what became known as the Battle of Krithia Vineyard, the 88th Brigade made another costly and futile attack along the exposed Krithia Spur.

At Suvla, the Battle of Scimitar Hill on 21 August was the final push of the failed August Offensive. The 29th Division had been moved from Helles to Suvla to participate. The 87th Brigade was briefly able to capture the summit of the hill but was soon forced to retreat.

The division was evacuated from Gallipoli on 2 January 1916 and moved to Egypt before being sent to France in March.

=== Somme ===
Passing through the Mediterranean port of Marseilles the 29th Division arrived in the rear of the Somme battle front from 15 to 29 March 1916. From this time the division was put into the British Front in the area north of the Ancre River, near to the German-held village of Beaumont Hamel. For the following three months the battalions in the division spent their time doing tours of trenches and training behind the lines to prepare for the large British offensive against the German position planned for the end of June. Following a 7-day artillery bombardment of the German front and rear areas, the battalions of the 29th Division were in position in their Assembly Trenches in the early hours of Saturday 1 July.

At 07:20 hours the huge Hawthorn mine was blown on the left of the division&#x27;s position. The leading battalions in the attack left the British front line trench at 07:30 hours. The British casualties were severe, with many men never reaching the German front line. The men of the Newfoundland Regiment moved forward at about 09:00 hours to follow on behind the leading battalion in the advance of 88th Brigade. Many of them were shot down trying to clamber overground to cover the few yards from where they were in the rear of the British front line to start their advance down the hill.

<text>South Glamorgan () is a preserved county of Wales.

It was originally formed in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, as a county council area. It consisted of the county borough of Cardiff along with the southern part of the administrative county of Glamorgan, and also the parish of St Mellons from Monmouthshire.

These areas were divided between two districts: Cardiff and Vale of Glamorgan. Of the counties created in the Act, this was an unusually low number of districts, with the Isle of Wight in England being the only other county with two. As well as Cardiff, the county included the main towns of Barry, Cowbridge, Llantwit Major and Penarth.

Local government of the county was shared, sometimes in conflict, between South Glamorgan County Council, Cardiff City Council and the Vale of Glamorgan Borough Council.

Following the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994, South Glamorgan was abolished on 1 April 1996, with both district councils becoming unitary authorities. These new authorities each also included small parts of Mid Glamorgan, with Wick, St Brides Major, and Ewenny transferred to the Vale of Glamorgan from the Ogwr district, while Pentyrch and Creigiau (from the Taff-Ely district) became part of Cardiff. At the same time the administrative county was abolished, it became a preserved county which subsequently incorporated the areas that both Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan received from Mid Glamorgan and its boundaries remained unchanged since its formation in 1996.

South Glamorgan continues in existence as a preserved county for purposes such as lieutenancy, and as such includes those communities.

<text>Mid Glamorgan () is a preserved county of Wales. From 1974 until 1996 it was also an administrative county with a county council.

Mid Glamorgan was formed in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. It consisted of part of the former administrative county of Glamorgan and the county borough of Merthyr Tydfil, along with the parishes of Penderyn and Vaynor from Brecknockshire and the urban districts of Bedwas and Machen, Rhymney and part of Bedwellty, from Monmouthshire.

It was divided into six districts:

*Cynon Valley
*Ogwr
*Merthyr Tydfil
*Rhondda
*Rhymney Valley
*Taff-Ely

Mid Glamorgan and its component districts were abolished in 1996 and the area split into the unitary authorities of Bridgend, Merthyr Tydfil, Rhondda Cynon Taf and part of Caerphilly as a result of the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994.

The communities of Wick, St Brides Major, Ewenny (from the Ogwr district) became part of the Vale of Glamorgan county borough, while Pentyrch (from the Taff-Ely district) was added to the Cardiff unitary authority area. Because of this, they became part of the preserved county of South Glamorgan. In 2003 the ceremonial borders were further adjusted, placing the entire Caerphilly county borough in the ceremonial county of Gwent.

The Mid Glamorgan County Council&#x27;s offices were located in the Glamorgan Building (the former headquarters of Glamorgan County Council) in Cathays Park, Cardiff and also in nearby Greyfriars Road, both outside the Mid Glamorgan boundaries.

The county council&#x27;s coat of arms was very similar to that of the previous council of Glamorganshire : &quot;Or, three chevronels gules between two clarions of the last in chief, and in base a Tudor rose barbed and seeded proper&quot;. The crest, as with Glamorganshire, was the same Welsh dragon rising from flames, only this time supporting a flag bearing three chevronels from the arms of Iestyn ap Gwrgant, the last ruler of the old Kingdom of Morgannwg. The coalminer and steel worker were retained as the supporters of the arms, but with their positions reversed. The motto &quot;A Ddioddefws A Orfu&quot; or &quot;He Who suffered, conquered&quot; was also retained from Glamorganshire.

<doc id="411723" wikidata="Q855658" url="?curid=411723" title="Chihuahuan Desert">
<text>The Chihuahuan Desert (, ) is a desert ecoregion designation covering parts of northern Mexico and the southwestern United States. It occupies much of far West Texas, the middle to lower Rio Grande Valley and the lower Pecos Valley in New Mexico, and a portion of southeastern Arizona, as well as the central and northern portions of the Mexican Plateau. It is bordered on the west by the Sonoran Desert, the Colorado Plateau, and the extensive Sierra Madre Occidental range, along with northwestern lowlands of the Sierra Madre Oriental range. Its largest, continual expanse is located in Mexico, covering a large portion of the state of Chihuahua, along with portions of Coahuila, north-eastern Durango, the extreme northern part of Zacatecas, and small western portions of Nuevo León. With an area of about , it is the largest hot desert in North America. The desert is fairly young, existing for only 8000 years.

==Geography==
There are several larger mountain ranges in the Chihuahuan Desert, including the Sierra Madre, the Sierra del Carmen, the Organ Mountains, the Franklin Mountains, the Sacramento Mountains, the Chisos Mountains, the Guadalupe Mountains, and the Davis Mountains. These create &quot;sky islands&quot; of cooler, wetter, climates adjacent to, or within the desert, and such elevated areas have both coniferous and broadleaf woodlands, including forests along drainages and favored exposures. The lower elevations of the Sandia–Manzano Mountains, the Magdalena–San Mateo Mountains, and the Gila Region partly border the Chihuahuan Desert and partly border other ecoregions that are not deserts.

There are few urban areas within the desert: the largest is Ciudad Juárez with almost two million inhabitants; Chihuahua, Saltillo, and Torreón; and the US cities of El Paso and Albuquerque. Alamogordo, Alpine, Benson, Carlsbad, Carrizozo, Deming, Fort Stockton, Fort Sumner, Las Cruces, Marfa, Pecos, Roswell, and Willcox are among the other communities in this ecoregion. Safford and Benson in Arizona are located in low elevations of the western edges of the Chihuahuan Desert, but in an ecotone with the Sonoran Desert.

According to the World Wide Fund for Nature the Chihuahuan Desert may be the most biologically diverse desert in the world as measured by species richness or endemism. The region has been badly degraded, mainly due to grazing. Many native grasses and other species have become dominated by woody native plants, including creosote bush and mesquite, due to overgrazing and other urbanization. The Mexican wolf, once abundant, was nearly extinct and remains on the endangered species list.

==Climate==
The desert is mainly a rain shadow desert because the two main mountain ranges which bound the desert, the Sierra Madre Occidental to the west and the Sierra Madre Oriental to the east, block most moisture from the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, respectively. Climatically, the desert mostly has an arid, mesothermal climate with one rainy season in the late summer and smaller amounts of precipitation in early winter, the mean daily temperature of the coldest month warmer than . The majority of rain falls between late June and early October during the North American Monsoon when moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and the Sea of Cortez penetrates into the region, or much less frequently, when a tropical cyclone moves inland and stalls. 

Owing to its inland position and higher elevation than the Sonoran Desert to the west, mostly varying from in elevation, the desert has a slightly milder climate in the summer (though usually daytime June temperatures are in the range of ), with mild to cool winters and occasional to frequent freezes. The hottest temperatures in the desert occur in lower elevation areas and valleys, including near the Rio Grande from south of El Paso into the Big Bend, and the Bolson de Mapimi. A subtropical temperature regime describes lower elevations in the Texas Big Bend region up to the Presidio and Candelaria areas, then southward into similar elevations, while a warm temperate temperature regime describes higher elevations and further north. The average annual temperature in the desert varies from about , depending on elevation and latitude. 

The mean annual precipitation for the Chihuahuan Desert is with a range of approximately , although it receives more precipitation than most other warm desert ecoregions. Nearly two-thirds of the arid zone stations have annual totals between . Snowfall is scant except at the higher elevation edges. Northern and eastern portions have more definite winters than southern and western portions, receiving a portion of winter precipitation as snowfall most winters.

==Flora==

The creosote bush (&quot;Larrea tridentata&quot;) is the dominant plant species on gravelly and occasional sandy soils in valley areas within the Chihuahuan Desert. The other species found with creosote bush depend on factors including the soil type, elevation, and degree of slope. Viscid acacia (&quot;Vachellia vernicosa&quot;), fourwing saltbush (&quot;Atriplex canescens&quot;), and tarbush (&quot;Flourensia cernua&quot;) are common in the desert scrub communities of northern portions, while broom dalea (&quot;Psorothamnus scoparius&quot;) occurs on sandy soils in western portions. &quot;Yucca&quot; and numerous &quot;Opuntia&quot; species are abundant on slopes and uplands in most areas, while Arizona rainbow cactus (&quot;Echinocereus polyacanthus&quot;) and Mexican fire-barrel cactus (&quot;Ferocactus pilosus&quot;) inhabit portions near the US–Mexico border.

Trees are less common than in nearby mountainous regions or the Sonoran Desert, due to greater aridity and less favorable precipitation seasons, but there are several common species in arroyos, floodplains, and mountain edges or canyons. Trees are often smaller in stature than in wetter areas, but those most common in Chihuahuan Desert arroyos include desert willow or mimbre (&quot;Chilopsis linearis&quot;), honey mesquite(&quot;Prosopis torreyana&quot;), netleaf hackberry (&quot;Celtis reticulata&quot;), and whitethorn (&quot;Vachellia constricta&quot;). Riparian floodplains in the ecoregion include rio grande cottonwood (&quot;Populus deltoides ssp. wislizeni&quot;), western cottonwood (&quot;Populus fremontii&quot;), and velvet ash (&quot;Fraxinus velutina&quot;); tornillo or screwbean mesquite (&quot;Prosopis pubescens&quot;) is limited to a few major river drainages such as the Rio Grande, and mostly in the floodplains.

Herbaceous plants, such as bush muhly (&quot;Muhlenbergia porteri&quot;), blue grama (&quot;Bouteloua gracilis&quot;), gypsum grama (&quot;B. breviseta&quot;), and hairy grama (&quot;B. hirsuta&quot;), are dominant in desert grasslands and near the mountain edges including the Sierra Madre Occidental. Lechuguilla (&quot;Agave lechuguilla&quot;), honey mesquite (&quot;Prosopis glandulosa&quot;), &quot;Opuntia macrocentra&quot; and &quot;Echinocereus pectinatus&quot; are the dominant species in western Coahuila. Ocotillo (&quot;Fouquieria splendens&quot;), lechuguilla, and &quot;Yucca filifera&quot; are the most common species in the southeastern part of the desert. Candelilla (&quot;Euphorbia antisyphilitica&quot;), &quot;Mimosa zygophylla&quot;, &quot;Acacia glandulifera&quot; and lechuguilla are found in areas with well-draining, shallow soils. The shrubs found near the Sierra Madre Oriental are exclusively lechuguilla, guapilla (&quot;Hechtia glomerata&quot;), Queen Victoria&#x27;s agave (&quot;Agave victoriae-reginae&quot;), sotol (&quot;Dasylirion&quot; spp.), and barreta (&quot;Helietta parvifolia&quot;), while the well-developed herbaceous layer includes grasses, legumes, and cacti.

Desert or arid grasslands comprise 20% of this desert and are often mosaics of shrubs and grasses. They include purple three-awn (&quot;Aristida purpurea&quot;), black grama (&quot;Bouteloua eriopoda&quot;), and sideoats grama (&quot;Bouteloua curtipendula&quot;). Early Spanish explorers reported encountering grasses that were &quot;belly high to a horse&quot;; most likely these were big alkali sacaton (&quot;Sporobolus wrightii&quot;) and tobosa (&quot;Pleuraphis mutica&quot;) along floodplain or bottomland areas.

The United Nations Environment Programme reported in 2006 that nearly half of the bird, mammal, and butterfly species in the Chihuahuan Desert are expected to be replaced by other species by 2055 due to climate change.

==Protected areas==
A 2017 assessment found that , or 7%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas. Protected areas include Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge in Arizona; Janos Biosphere Reserve, Médanos de Samalayuca Natural Protected Area and Cañón de Santa Elena Flora and Fauna Protection Area in Chihuahua; Cuatro Ciénegas Basin, Ocampo Flora and Fauna Protection Area, and part of Maderas del Carmen Biosphere Reserve in Coahuila; Mapimí Biosphere Reserve and Cañón de Fernández State Park in Durango; Bitter Lake National Wildlife Refuge, Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge, Carlsbad Caverns National Park, Carrizozo Malpais, Oliver Lee Memorial State Park, Organ Mountains–Desert Peaks National Monument, Petroglyph National Monument, Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, and White Sands National Park in New Mexico; and Big Bend National Park, Big Bend Ranch State Park, Black Gap Wildlife Management Area, Franklin Mountains State Park, and part of Guadalupe Mountains National Park in Texas.

<text>West Glamorgan () is a former administrative county in South Wales. It is now a preserved county.

West Glamorgan was one of the divisions of the ancient county of Glamorgan. It was created on 1 April 1974, by the Local Government Act 1972 from the county borough of Swansea, the municipal boroughs of Neath and Port Talbot, the urban districts of Glyncorrwg and Llwchwr, Gower Rural District, Pontardawe Rural District, and all of Neath Rural District except the parish of Rhigos. From 1982, the main offices of West Glamorgan County Council were located in County Hall, Swansea.

West Glamorgan had four districts, as follows:
*Swansea – Swansea CB and Gower RD
*Lliw Valley – Llwchwr and Pontardawe RD
*Neath – Neath and Neath RD
*Port Talbot – Port Talbot and Glyncorrwg

Following the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994, West Glamorgan and its component districts were abolished on 1 April 1996, the area being divided into the two unitary authorities of Swansea and Neath and Port Talbot (later changed to &quot;Neath Port Talbot&quot;). Lliw Valley was partitioned between the two authorities. A West Glamorgan preserved county was created for the limited functions of Lieutenancy and High Shrievalty.

==Coat of arms==
The arms of West Glamorgan were: &quot;Argent three chevronels gules, between in chief two pine cones vert dimidiating as many gouttes sable, and in base a lozenge sable.&quot; The crest is a Welsh Dragon holding a Tudor rose in its forepaws, rising above four gold cogwheels. The supporters are an osprey and a heron, both with a fish in their beaks, and wearing a chain round their necks. The osprey is standing on water, and the heron on a ploughed field. The motto is (Welsh: &#x27;The just are strong&#x27;). The chevronels derive from the arms of the de Clare family; the pine cones represent forestry; the black drops (gouttes) the oil industry; and the black lozenge, coal. The four cogwheels above the shield stand for the four districts and their industries; the chains around the supporters&#x27; necks, the steel and aluminium industries; the water and the fish, fishing; and the ploughed field, agriculture.

<doc id="411726" wikidata="Q434121" url="?curid=411726" title="Jack Kingston">
<text>John Heddens Kingston (born April 24, 1955) is an American businessman, lobbyist, and politician who served as U.S. representative for in southeast Georgia, serving from 1993 to 2015. He is a member of the Republican Party and was part of the House leadership (2002–06) when he served as vice-chair of the Republican Conference. In 2014, he ran for the U.S. Senate seat occupied by retiring senator Saxby Chambliss and advanced beyond the May 20 primary to the July 22 runoff, where he was defeated by David Perdue. 
==Early life and education==
Kingston was born on April 24, 1955, in Bryan, Texas. He is the son of Martha Ann (née Heddens) and Albert James Kingston Jr., a widely published university professor, who co-founded the National Reading Conference. His father was born in Brooklyn and his mother in Los Angeles. As a child, Kingston lived briefly in Ethiopia. He grew up in Athens, Georgia. Kingston received a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from the University of Georgia in 1978, where he also joined Lambda Chi Alpha and the Demosthenian Literary Society. He is an Episcopalian.

== Early career ==
He has lived in Savannah since 1977. Before entering politics in 1982, he sold insurance and worked in agribusiness throughout southeastern Georgia. He was vice president of Palmer, Cay and Carswell from 1979 to 1992.

===Georgia House of Representatives===

====Elections====
In 1984, Kingston defeated Democratic candidate Bobby Phillips 62%–38%. He won re-election in 1986, 1988, and 1990 all unopposed.

====Committee assignments====
* House Committee on Ways and Means

==U.S. House of Representatives (1993–2015)==

===Elections===
In 1992, Kingston gave up his seat in the state house to pursue a congressional run in Georgia&#x27;s 1st congressional district after five-term Democratic incumbent Lindsay Thomas announced his retirement. The district had been one of the first areas of Georgia where the old-line conservative Democratic Party voters had begun splitting their tickets and voting Republican at the national level. While conservative Democrats represented much of this area in the state legislature well into the 1990s, the district has only supported a Democratic nominee for president once since 1960, when Jimmy Carter swept every county in the state during his successful run for the presidency in 1976.

Kingston won the election with 58% of the vote, becoming the first Republican to represent this district since Reconstruction, and the first to win an undisputed election in the district in 118 years. Kingston was helped by the 1990s round of redistricting, which significantly altered the district. The 1st had been based in Savannah for over a century. However, redistricting shifted most of Savannah&#x27;s African-American residents to the newly created 12th District.

Kingston was reelected 10 times, never dropping below 63% of the vote and even running unopposed in 1998 and 2004. Even when the district included all of Savannah (as was the case from 1996 to 2002 and again after the 2010s round of redistricting), Kingston was reelected without serious difficulty.

===Tenure===
From 2003 through the end of 2006, Kingston served as vice-chairman of the House Republican Conference, the sixth-ranking post among House Republicans. An early attempt to become chair of the influential House Appropriations Committee in the 112th Congress (2011–2013) was unsuccessful. Kingston was an early supporter of earmark reforms and spending reductions. Throughout his tenure, Kingston has received over 40 awards on a diversity of issues from various interest groups.

====Taxes====
Kingston signed the Taxpayer Protection Pledge by the Americans for Tax Reform, and in 2009 he was named a &quot;Taxpayer Hero&quot; by the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste for his votes to reduce government spending and taxes.

In 2010 Kingston signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes.

====Healthcare====
Kingston is a supporter of Medicare prescription drug coverage. He has voted to allow HMOs to be sued, and also to limit damages and shorten time limits for medical lawsuits. In 2010, he voted against the Affordable Care Act, asserting the bill would raise premiums, taxes, and cut Medicare.

====Energy====
Kingston has voted to bar the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases, and voted to add pollutants to the Clean Water Act. He has voted against tax incentives for renewable energy and in favor of opening the Outer Continental Shelf to oil drilling.

====Gun control====
Kingston voted to loosen restrictions on interstate gun purchases and to allow veterans to register unlicensed guns acquired abroad.

====Clinton impeachment====
In November 1997, Kingston was one of eighteen Republicans in the House to co-sponsor a resolution by Bob Barr that sought to launch an impeachment inquiry against President Bill Clinton. The resolution did not specify any charges or allegations. This was an early effort to impeach Clinton, predating the eruption of the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal. The eruption of that scandal would ultimately lead to a more serious effort to impeach Clinton in 1998. On October 8, 1998, Kingston voted in favor of legislation that was passed to open an impeachment inquiry. On December 19, 1998, Kingston voted in favor of all four proposed articles of impeachment against Clinton (only two of which received the needed majority of votes to be adopted).

====Savannah Harbor Expansion Project====

Kingston sponsored legislation in 1999 to authorize the expansion of the Savannah harbor in order to accommodate larger vessels.

====Washington work week====
Regarding the extension of the House work week from 3 days to 5 in 2006, Kingston commented, &quot;Keeping us up here eats away at families. Marriages suffer. The Democrats could care less about families – that&#x27;s what this says.&quot; He added, &quot;Time away from Washington is just as important to being an effective member of Congress as time spent in the Capitol. When I&#x27;m here, people call me Mr. Congressman. When I&#x27;m home, people call me &#x27;Jack, you stupid SOB, why did you vote that way?&#x27; It keeps me grounded.&quot;

====School Lunch Program====
In an address to the Jackson County Republican Party, on December 14, 2013, Kingston, who is on the House Agricultural Committee, which oversees the federal school lunch program for the underprivileged, commented that it may be beneficial for students to &quot;...sweep the floor in the cafeteria&quot; to promote a work ethic and &quot;instill in them that there is, in fact, no such thing as a free lunch.&quot;

Kingston has said he was not &quot;allegedly&quot; advocating that poor children be singled out but rather that all children should perform chores to learn work ethic but emphasised those students specifically that were getting free lunches as the ones that should be working. &quot;This is not targeted to any one group. It would be very helpful for kids in any socio-economic group to do chores and learn the work ethic. Those kids aren&#x27;t there because of any fault of their own and I never suggested that they were,&quot; Kingston said on CNN.

Kingston has sponsored 103 bills and resolutions, including:

A modified version of this bill that restricted purchases to 2013 was introduced in the 111th Congress as H.R. 621, and was signed into law October 29, 2009.

====111th Congress (2009–2010)====

Kingston works as a public policy principal at the firm of Squire Patton Boggs in Washington. Since August 2015, he has been chairman of the Georgia Republican Party Foundation, the fundraising arm of the Georgia GOP. In 2016, he endorsed Ted Cruz for president, but later he served as senior advisor and spokesperson for the Donald Trump campaign. In 2017, he became a CNN political commentator. He was dropped from the network in February 2019.

=== Comments on Stoneman Douglas High School shooting ===
On February 18, 2018, four days after the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting which left 17 people dead, in an interview with CNN, Kingston suggested that the survivors of the massacre, who had organized to oppose gun violence, were being taken advantage of by &quot;left wing activists&quot; and funded by George Soros. His comments angered the survivors of the shooting who described them as &quot;despicable&quot; and called on Kingston to apologize.

<doc id="411727" wikidata="Q116191" url="?curid=411727" title="Toilet seat">
<text>A toilet seat is a hinged unit consisting of a round or oval open seat, and usually a lid, which is bolted onto the bowl of a toilet used in a sitting position (as opposed to a squat toilet). The seat can be either for a flush toilet or a dry toilet. A toilet seat consists of the seat itself, which may be contoured for the user to sit on, and the lid, which covers the toilet when it is not in use – the lid may be absent in some cases, particularly in public restrooms. 

== Usage ==

Toilet seats often have a lid. This lid is frequently left open. The combined toilet seat and lid may be kept in a closed position when a toilet is not in use, making it so—at a minimum—the lid must be raised prior to use. It can be closed to prevent small items from falling in, reduce odors, or provide a chair in the toilet room for aesthetic purposes. Some studies show that closing the lid prevents the spread of aerosols on flushing (&quot;toilet plume&quot;), which might be a source of disease transmission.

Depending on the sex of the user and type of use (urination or defecation) the seat itself may be left either up or down. The issue of whether the seat and lid should be placed in the closed position after use is a perennial topic of discussion and light humor (usually across gender lines), with it often being argued that leaving the toilet seat &quot;up&quot; is more efficient for men, while putting it &quot;down&quot; is more considerate for women. The &quot;right answer&quot; seems to depend on factors ranging from the location of the toilet (public or private), the population of the users (e.g. a sorority house vs frat house) and/or personal or family values, opinions, preferences, agreements or toiletry habits.

Toilet seats often rest not directly on the porcelain or metal body of the toilet itself but upon the hinges and upon tabs/spacers affixed at a few spots. Similarly, lids do not rest directly in uniform contact with the seat but are elevated while above it by the hinges and tabs/spacers affixed at a few spots. This is a possible area where effluent aerosols can be spread when shut.

== Variations ==
Toilet seats are manufactured in a range of different styles and colors, and they may be furnished matching the style of the toilet itself. They are usually built to fit the shape of the toilet bowl: two examples of this being the elongated bowl and the regular bowl. Some toilet seats are fitted with slow-closing hinges to reduce noise by preventing them from slamming against the bowl.

Some seats are made of various types of wooden materials, like oak or walnut, and others are made soft for added comfort. Seats with printed multi-colored designs, such as floral or newsprint, have been fashionable at times. Other designs are made of transparent plastic, encapsulating small decorative items such as seashells or coins. The price of toilet seats varies quite considerably.

Decorative textile covers for the toilet seat lid have gone in and out of fashion. Advocates claim that they allow the toilet to be used as a more comfortable seat and provide another way of decorating a bathroom. At the same time, critics view them as a sanitation problem which creates unnecessary work.

Some metal toilets, such as those in many jails and prisons, have built-in toilet seats that cannot be removed, so that an inmate cannot fashion it into a weapon, shield or escape tool.

=== Open front toilet seats ===

The International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials&#x27; Uniform Plumbing Code, section 409.2.2, requires that &quot;all water closet seats, except those within dwelling units or for private use, shall be of the open front type&quot;. There is an exception for toilets with an automatic toilet-seat cover dispenser. The code is followed by most public authorities, so many public toilets feature open front toilet seats (also called &quot;split seats&quot;).

The purpose for this seat design is to prevent genitals contacting the seat. It also omits an area of the seat that could be contaminated with urine and avoids contact for easier wiping.

===Modern design, electronic integration, and function===
====Slow-close====
A slow-close seat uses special hinges to prevent the seat from slamming down. Special hinges provide resistance, allowing the seat to lower slowly.

====Warming====
High-tech toilet seats may include many features, including a heated seat, a bidet, and a blow drier. High-tech seats are most common in Japan, where a seat with integrated bidets is colloquially called a Washlet, after a leading brand. Electrically heated toilet seats have been popular in Japan since the 1970s. Since Japanese bathrooms are often unheated, the toilet seat sometimes doubles as a space heater. Integrated bidets date from around 1980, and have since become very popular in Japan, and are becoming more common in most other developed countries.

Water-heated seats were in use in royal homes in Britain in the twentieth century. The first electrically heated toilet seat was manufactured by Cyril Reginald Clayton at St Leonard&#x27;s on Sea in Sussex. A UK patent was applied for on 5 January 1959, filing on 4 January 1960 and granted in August 1963 (UK patent no. 934209). The first model, the &#x27;Deluxete&#x27;, was made of fiberglass with a heating element in the lid triggered by a mercury switch that warmed the seat when the lid was down. Subsequent improvements were made and another UK patent applied for, this time for a deodorizing model with integral fan on 20 May 1970. It was granted on 17 May 1972 (UK patent no. 1260402). At first marketed as the &#x27;Deodar&#x27;, this model was later sold as the &#x27;Readywarm&#x27;. Among the early users of the &#x27;Deluxete&#x27; was racing driver Stirling Moss. With the permission of Reginald Clayton, the electrically heated seat was further developed by the Japanese firm Matsushita. In 1993, Matt DiRoberto of Worcester, Massachusetts invented the padded toilet seat, an early 1990s fad.

=== Seatless toilet ===
A seatless toilet has no toilet seat. It may be much cleaner and easier to clean than toilet seats, while the structurally sound and hard rim of a porcelain toilet bowl still allows sitting. Users not aware of the possibility to sit on this type of toilet may hover over.

==Disposable covers==
A disposable piece of paper, shaped like the toilet seat itself and known as a disposable toilet seat cover or toilet sheet, can be placed on the seat. Its purpose is to make the toilet user feel more reassured that they are protected from germs. The first known patented model of the toilet seat cover dispenser dates back to 1942 and was invented by J.C. Thomasa. 

While toilet seat covers give public toilet users a sense of cleanliness, studies have shown they are not needed as there are few germs on a toilet seat, and infections such as salmonella are spread via the hands, not the buttocks.

== Society and culture ==

===Humor===
The toilet seat functions as a comic standby for sight gags relating to toilet humor. The most common is someone staggering out of a toilet room after an explosion with a toilet seat around his neck. In the television show &quot;Dead Like Me&quot;, George Lass, the main character, is killed when a zero-G toilet seat from space station Mir re-enters the atmosphere.

===US Navy&#x27;s &quot;$600 Toilet Seat&quot;===
The P-3C Orion antisubmarine aircraft went into service in 1962. Twenty-five years later, in 1987, it was determined that the toilet shroud, the cover that fits over the toilet, needed replacement. Since the airplane was out of production this would require new tooling to produce. These on-board toilets required a uniquely shaped, molded fiberglass shroud that had to satisfy specifications for vibration resistance, weight, and durability. The molds had to be specially made, as it had been decades since their original production. The price reflected the design work and the cost of the equipment to manufacture them. Lockheed Corporation charged $34,560 for 54 toilet covers, or $640 each.

President Ronald Reagan held a televised news conference in 1987, where he held up one of these shrouds and stated: &quot;We didn&#x27;t buy any $600 toilet seat. We bought a $600 molded plastic cover for the entire toilet system.&quot; A Pentagon spokesman, Glenn Flood stated, &quot;The original price we were charged was $640, not just for a toilet seat, but for the large molded plastic assembly covering the entire seat, tank and full toilet assembly. The seat itself cost $9 and some cents.… The supplier charged too much, and we had the amount corrected.&quot; The president of Lockheed at the time, Lawrence Kitchen, adjusted the price to $100 each and returned $29,165. &quot;This action is intended to put to rest an artificial issue,&quot; Kitchen stated.

<doc id="411730" wikidata="Q1067984" url="?curid=411730" title="Clwyd">
<text>Clwyd ( , ) is a preserved county of Wales, situated in the north-east corner of the country; it is named after the River Clwyd, which runs through the area. To the north lies the Irish Sea, with the English ceremonial counties of Cheshire to the east and Shropshire to the south-east. Powys and Gwynedd lie to the south and west respectively. Clwyd also shares a maritime boundary with Merseyside along the River Dee. Between 1974 and 1996, a slightly different area had a county council, with local government functions shared with six district councils. In 1996, Clwyd was abolished, and the new principal areas of Conwy County Borough, Denbighshire, Flintshire and Wrexham County Borough were created; under this reorganisation, &quot;Clwyd&quot; became a preserved county, with the name being retained for certain ceremonial functions.

This area of north-eastern Wales has been settled since prehistoric times; the Romans built a fort beside a ford on the River Conwy, and the Normans and Welsh disputed the territory. They built their castles at strategic locations as they advanced and retreated, but in the end England prevailed, and Edward I conquered the country in 1282. The Laws in Wales Act 1535 incorporated Wales under the English Crown and made it subject to English law.

Traditionally, agriculture was the mainstay of the economy of this part of Wales, but with the Industrial Revolution, the North Wales Coalfield was developed and parts of eastern Clwyd around the Dee estuary and Wrexham became industrialised. The advent of the railway running from Chester along the North Wales coast in the mid-19th century made it easy for urban dwellers from Lancashire and Cheshire to visit the seaside towns of North Wales.

==History==
North Wales has had human settlements since prehistoric times. By the time the Romans reached Britain, the area that is now Clwyd was occupied by the Celtic Deceangli tribe. They lived in a chain of hill forts running through the Clwydian Range and their tribal capital was Canovium, at an important crossing of the River Conwy. This fell to the Romans, who built their own fort here, in about AD 75; and the whole of Wales was soon under their control. After the Roman departure from Britain in AD 410, the successor states of Gwynedd and Powys controlled the area. From about 800 onwards, a series of dynastic marriages led to Rhodri Mawr inheriting the kingdoms of Gwynedd and Powys. After his death, this kingdom was divided among his three sons and further strife followed: not only Welsh battles were fought, but there were also many raids by Danes and Saxons.
The Normans conquest of England at first had little effect on North Wales. This was to change as the city of Chester on the River Dee became the base for successive campaigns against the country in the 13th century. The coastal plain of Clwyd was the main invasion route, and a number of castles were built there to assist these advances. The castles at Flint and Rhuddlan date from this period, and were the first to be built by Edward I of England in North Wales during his successful conquest in 1282. After this, the rule of the Welsh princes was at an end and Wales was annexed to England. This area was known as the Principality of Wales from 1216 to 1536. From 1301, the Crown&#x27;s lands in north and west Wales formed part of the appanage of England&#x27;s heir apparent, who was given the title &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;. Under the Laws in Wales Act 1535, Wales became permanently incorporated under the English Crown and subject to English law.
Although the Industrial Revolution did not much affect the rural parts of the area, there was considerable industrial activity in the North Wales Coalfield, particularly around Wrexham. The Bersham Ironworks at Bersham, in the same area, was at the forefront of technological advances and was most famous for being the original working site of the industrialist John Wilkinson who invented new processes for boring cannons. The Williams-Wynn family of Wynnstay had become rich after the dissolution of the monasteries and owned vast estates in Clwyd with resources including lead, tin and copper as well as corn and timber.

==Geography==
Clwyd is in the northeastern corner of Wales. It is bounded by the Irish Sea to the north, the Welsh preserved counties of Gwynedd to the west and Powys to the south, and the English ceremonial counties of Shropshire and Cheshire to the southeast and east respectively; much of the eastern boundary follows the course of the River Dee and its estuary. Other large rivers in the area include the River Alyn, a tributary of the Dee, the River Clwyd and the River Conwy in the west. The northern coastal strip is heavily developed for tourism and has many resorts, including Llandudno, Colwyn Bay, Colwyn, Abergele, Rhyl and Prestatyn. In the northeast lies Deeside, the coastal plain beside the Dee estuary, and this part of Clwyd is heavily developed for industry. The area around Wrexham and the commuter settlements close to Chester are also heavily built up.
To the west of this is a ridge of mountains with a steep scarp slope to the west, the Clwydian Range. The highest point of these hills is Moel Famau at . The north-central part is the broad Vale of Clwyd, and the best agricultural land lies here. To the south of this, the land is much higher and more rugged, the Denbigh Moors and the Berwyn range are here. The central and western parts are much more rural than the coastal area and the east, with part of the Snowdonia National Park lying in the western part. The population as of 2007 is estimated at 491,100, based on figures for the four component unitary authority areas.

Since the 2003 boundary changes, its coastline has extended from the Dee Estuary in Flintshire through to Llanfairfechan.
Clwyd consists of the whole of the historic county of Flintshire, and most of Denbighshire. Since 2003 it has also included the former district of Aberconwy, which lies in the historic county of Caernarfonshire, and also the former Edeyrnion Rural District in the historic county of Merionethshire.

==Economy==

The land uses of any region depend on the underlying geology which influences the soil types. In the Clwydian Range, lead and spar minerals have been mined in the past, and limestone quarried from Llantysilio Mountain, Ruabon Mountain and Minera Mountain near Wrexham. The Minera Limeworks were once the largest lime workings in North Wales. Later, road building stone was extracted but the quarries closed in 1992. Coal mining in the North Wales Coalfield ceased in the second half of the twentieth century but used to be a large source of employment in the area. The main products being manufactured in industrial east Clwyd include aircraft components (Airbus), engines (Toyota), paper (Shotton Paper) and steel processing, and the port of Mostyn builds and supports offshore windfarms.

Agriculture, largely based on livestock, has traditionally been the main occupation in the central and western parts. There are a mix of large and small farm businesses, and a thriving dairy sector in the Vale of Clwyd. Many of the towns have livestock markets and the farming industry supports farm machinery merchants, vets, feed merchants, contractors and all the ancillary trades connected with agriculture. With their incomes on the decline, farmers have found opportunities in tourism, rural crafts, specialist food shops, farmers&#x27; markets and value-added food products.
The upland areas with their sheep farms and small, stone-walled fields are attractive to visitors, and redundant farm buildings are often converted to self-catering accommodation while the farmhouses themselves supply bed-and-breakfast opportunities. The arrival of the railway on the coast in the mid-nineteenth century opened up travel from Merseyside and caused a boom in tourism, with guesthouses in seaside towns offering board and lodging for the urban visitors. More recently caravan sites and holiday villages have blossomed and there has been an increase in the ownership of &quot;second homes&quot;.

Various initiatives designed to boost the economy of North Wales are being attempted in 2016. These include the Northern Gateway project on the former Sealand RAF site on Deeside, and a redevelopment project for the former Rhyl seafront and funfair.

==Administrative history==
The Local Government Commission for Wales set up in 1958 was the first to recommend wholesale amalgamation of the administrative counties outside Glamorgan and Monmouthshire, with extensive boundary changes; however the then Minister of Housing and Local Government Sir Keith Joseph decided not to accept the report, noting that county amalgamations in England had been highly unpopular when proposed.

In 1967, after a change of government, the Secretary of State for Wales Cledwyn Hughes published a white paper which revived the idea of amalgamation, but instead of the boundary changes proposed in the previous report, treated each county as a whole. The report recommended a single new &quot;Gwynedd&quot; incorporating Denbighshire, Flintshire, Caernarfonshire, Merionethshire and Anglesey. The white paper stated that &quot;the need for early action is particularly urgent in Wales&quot;, and so the issue was not referred to a Royal Commission as in England. Opponents criticised the proposed new council for being too large, and in November 1968 a new Secretary of State announced that Gwynedd would be divided into two.

This revised proposal was continued in a further white paper in March 1970, although this proposed that the councils be unitary authorities which would have no district councils below them. The incoming Conservative government resurrected two-tier local government in a consultative document published in February 1971, again with the same upper-tier boundaries. Some minor changes having been made to the existing boundaries due to special local factors, the Local Government Act 1972 duly created Clwyd as a merger of Flintshire with most of Denbighshire, along with the Edeyrnion Rural District from Merionethshire. The 1970 white paper had introduced the name of Clwyd by reference to the River Clwyd and the Clwydian range of hills; Clwyd was the only new Welsh county which did not take its name from an ancient kingdom.

For second-tier local government purposes, Clwyd was divided into six districts: Alyn and Deeside, Colwyn, Delyn, Glyndŵr, Rhuddlan and Wrexham Maelor, each being operated by a district or borough council. These were abolished, along with the county itself, on 1 April 1996. Clwyd County Council&#x27;s coat of arms was granted in December 1974. The design of the shield, crest and motto includes elements taken from the arms of the former councils of Flintshire and Denbighshire. The green and white wave represents the Vale of Clwyd and the Clwydian Range lying between the two parts. The cross and choughs come from Flintshire&#x27;s shield, which itself incorporated the traditional arms of Edwin of Tegeingl, while the black lion of the Princes of Powys Fadog is taken from Denbighshire&#x27;s shield. The motto, &quot;Tarian Cyfiawnder Duw&quot; can be translated as &quot;The shield of Justice is God&quot;.

Clwyd County Council and its districts were abolished by the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994, and local government would be replaced by the four unitary authorities of Flintshire, Wrexham County Borough, Denbighshire, and parts of Conwy (along with some smaller communities moving to Powys). The Act also abolished the County, and states the term &quot;county&quot; would be synonymous with the &quot;principal areas&quot; created by the 1994 Act. However the Act then created a further set of &quot;preserved counties&quot;, which were based on the eight created by the 1972 Act. These Preserved Counties, similar in respect to English Ceremonial counties, would be retained for a variety of purposes, including lieutenancy and shrievalty.

Clwyd County Council and its six districts ceased operations at midnight on 1 April 1996, and local government was immediately transferred to the new principal areas of Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire and Wrexham. However, although bearing the same names, the boundaries of Flintshire and Denbighshire were substantially different from those of the historic counties. As it happened, the county records for historic Flintshire had been retained at the Hawarden branch of the Clwyd Records Office while those for historic Denbighshire had continued to be held at the Ruthin branch, so there was no problem in segregating the records.

The Preserved County of Clwyd came into effect on the same day that Clwyd County Council was abolished. The preserved county was almost identical to the 1974–96 county, but had a few minor changes in line with changes to local government boundaries, the communities of Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant, Llansilin and Llangedwyn being transferred from Clwyd to Powys.

==2003 boundary review==

In 2003, the borders of Clwyd were changed to cover the remainder of Conwy (which had previously been part of Gwynedd), which was part of a Wales-wide re-organisation of the preserved counties, so that boundaries of the preserved counties would contain whole current principal areas only.

This led to some areas, such as the Aberconwy district, moving to a preserved county it had never been administered by in the past, and therefore these moves went generally unreported due to the preserved county&#x27;s limited status. The Boundary Commission proceeded to retain the eight preserved counties, and modified their borders in 2003 to match with the incumbent principal area boundaries. The 2003 arrangement brings towns such as Llandudno and Conwy into the preserved county of Clwyd.

==Legacy==
Some local organisations still make use of the word &quot;Clwyd&quot; in their name, often because their membership covers a wider area than their present unitary authority. These organisations include the Theatr Clwyd, which is based in Mold and is the largest producing arts centre in Wales. It provides young people the opportunity to get involved in drama. The Clwyd Family History Society can help its members to access many historical documents concerning northeastern Wales, and the Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust is one of four archaeological trusts covering the whole of Wales. The Clwyd County Darts Association organises tournaments and takes part in inter-county matches. The Clwyd East Football League was created in 2011 to represent the North East Wales area at the fifth tier of Welsh Football. It has subsequently changed its name to the North East Wales Football League. The Clwyd Pension Fund is the Local Government pension scheme inherited from Clwyd County Council, now providing pension schemes for Wrexham, Flintshire and Denbighshire unitary authorities and former districts.

The position of Lord Lieutenant of Clwyd also continues as the Monarch&#x27;s personal representative, as with the other seven preserved counties of Wales. The current Lord Lieutenant is Henry George Fetherstonhaugh, who was appointed in 2013.

==Landmarks==

The Pontcysyllte Aqueduct was built by Thomas Telford in 1805 and is the largest aqueduct in the United Kingdom; it carries the Llangollen Canal over the River Dee and is a World Heritage Site, being considered a masterpiece of civil engineering. The Clwydian Range and Dee Valley constitute an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, one of just five in the whole of Wales. Denbigh, Colwyn and Ruthin are historic towns and Llangollen hosts the Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod in July each year.

The Gop is a Neolithic mound, the second largest such structure in Britain being only superseded by Silbury Hill. Caer Drewyn is one of many Iron Age hill forts in Clwyd that attest to human occupation of this area for millennia. Maen Achwyfan Cross is a carved 10th century wheel cross depicting Celtic and Viking symbols. The castles of Rhuddlan and Flint were built by the Normans during their invasion of North Wales and Castell Dinas Brân was a Welsh fortress of the same period. St Asaph Cathedral also dates from the thirteenth century as does the medieval Cistercian abbey of Valle Crucis.

Bodnant Garden is a formal garden in a landscaped setting, and Erddig Hall is a stately home, both owned by the National Trust. Other fine country houses in Clwyd include Trevor Hall and Faenol Fawr, Bodelwyddan, while Plas Mawr and Aberconwy House are historic town houses in Conwy. Also in Conwy is the Conwy Suspension Bridge, one of the first such bridges in the world.

==Transport==

The North Wales Coast Line is the railway line from Crewe to Holyhead, served by Transport for Wales and Avanti West Coast services. Trains leaving Crewe pass through Chester, cross the River Dee into Wales, and continue through stations such as: Shotton, Flint, Prestatyn, Rhyl, Colwyn Bay, Llandudno Junction, Conwy and Bangor, to Holyhead, from where there is a ferry service to Ireland. Passengers can change at Shotton for the Borderlands Line, which links Wrexham with Bidston on the Wirral Peninsula in England. The Conwy Valley Line links Llandudno Junction to Blaenau Ffestiniog via Betws-y-Coed and was constructed mainly for use as a freight line for the transport of slate to the quay at Deganwy for export by sea. It is a scenic route with a number of request stops. The Shrewsbury–Chester line connects , northwards to Chester and southwards to other stations in the present-day county borough and to .

There are no motorways in Clwyd. The A55 dual carriageway road passes from Chester through St Asaph to the North Wales coast at Abergele, after which it runs parallel to the railway line through Conwy and Bangor to terminate at Holyhead. The A483 connects Wrexham northwards to Chester, and southwards to Ruabon and Chirk. The A548 passes from Chester to Abergele through Deeside and along the coast, before leaving the coast and terminating at Llanrwst. The main road from London is the A5 which enters Clwyd at Chirk and passes northwestwards through Llangollen, Corwen and Betws-y-Coed to join the A55 and terminate at Bangor. The A543 crosses the Denbigh Moors from southeast to northwest, and the A525 links Ruthin with St Asaph. There are local bus services between the main centres of population. Several services by Arriva Buses Wales run along the main coast road between Chester and Holyhead, linking the coastal resorts. Other routes include: Llandudno to Llanrwst and Betws-y-Coed via Conwy and Dolgarrog; Rhyl to Denbigh; Wrexham to Chester; and Wrexham to Mold.

<text>Sanford Dixon Bishop Jr. (born February 4, 1947) is an American lawyer and politician serving as the U.S. representative for since 1993. He became the dean of Georgia&#x27;s congressional delegation after the death of John Lewis. A member of the Blue Dog Coalition, he belongs to the moderate faction of the Democratic Party. His district is in southwestern Georgia and includes Albany, Thomasville, and most of Columbus and Macon.

==Early life, education, and legal career==
Bishop was born in Mobile, Alabama, to Minnie B. Slade and Sanford Dixon Bishop, the first president of Bishop State Community College. Bishop obtained a B.A. degree from Morehouse College in 1968, majoring in political science and minoring in English, and a J.D. degree from Emory University School of Law in 1971. At Morehouse, he was a classmate of Herman Cain. He served in the United States Army between 1969 and 1971. Bishop subsequently operated a law firm in Columbus, Georgia.

Bishop has received the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award from the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), given to Eagle Scouts for distinguished career achievement. He is a member of BSA&#x27;s Order of the Arrow (OA) and as a youth was on the OA ceremonies team. He is a resident of Albany, Georgia, where he is a member of the Mount Zion Baptist Church. Bishop is a Life Member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity, initiated at Morehouse&#x27;s Pi chapter. He is a Shriner and 33° Mason.

Bishop is married to Vivian Creighton, who served from 1993 to 2021 as Municipal Clerk of Columbus.

==Georgia legislature==
Bishop was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives in 1977, where he remained until being elected to the Georgia Senate in 1990.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
====1992====
After only one term in the state senate, he ran for the 2nd district in 1992, which was held by six-term U.S. Congressman Charles Hatcher, a white moderate Democrat. The 2nd had been reconfigured as a black-majority district during congressional apportionment following the 1990 Census. Bishop finished second behind Hatcher in a crowded six-way primary. Hatcher failed to reach the 50% threshold, and was forced into a runoff election. During the campaign Bishop attacked Hatcher for bouncing 819 checks in the House banking scandal. Bishop defeated him 53%–47%. In the general election, he defeated Republican Jim Dudley 64%–36%.

====1994====
In the Democratic primary, he defeated James Bush 67%–33%. In the general election, he won reelection to a second term with 66%.

====1996====
In 1995, a 5–4 majority of the Supreme Court ruled that the redistricting of Georgia had violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The 2nd district was thus redrawn. The newly redrawn district was 60% white. Nonetheless, Bishop won reelection to a third term with 54% of the vote.

====1998====
Bishop won reelection to a fourth term against Republican Joseph F. McCormick with 57% of the vote. During the campaign, Bishop received twice the campaign financing that his opponent raised.

====2000====
Bishop defeated Dylan Glenn, a young black Republican who received strong backing from many national Republican leaders. The vote was 53%–47%.

====2002====
Bishop won reelection to a sixth term unopposed.

====2004====
Bishop won reelection to a seventh term with 67% of the vote.

====2006====

He won reelection to an eighth term with 68% of the vote.

====2008====

Bishop won reelection to a ninth term with 69% of the vote.

====2010====

Bishop won reelection to a tenth term against Republican State Representative Mike Keown, 51%–49%, the closest margin of his career. In a year where the Democrats lost the majority in the House, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Bishop&#x27;s reelection odds seemed slim because he was an &quot;incumbent in an anti-Washington year&quot;, because he was a black man in a majority white district (49% White, 47% Black), and because of a scholarship scandal at his nonprofit.

====2012====

After redistricting, the 2nd district became a black-majority district. Notably, it added most of Macon, previously the heart of the 8th district. Bishop was heavily favored in the general election as a result. He defeated Republican John House with 63% of the vote.

===Tenure===

Bishop is a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, as well as the Blue Dog Democrats, a group of moderate to conservative House Democrats. Due to his willingness to work across the aisle, Bishop was ranked the 16th most bipartisan member of the 114th Congress. The ranking was part of the Bipartisan Index put forth by The Lugar Center in collaboration with Georgetown University. As of 2022, Bishop has voted with President Joe Biden 100% of the time, according to FiveThirtyEight.

Serving a primarily agricultural district, Bishop has fought to preserve the federal price supports for peanuts, southwest Georgia&#x27;s most important crop. &quot;The New York Times&quot; quoted the chairman of the agency that administers federal farm programs in Georgia as saying, &quot;It&#x27;s questionable whether it would have survived without the votes [Bishop] brought to it&quot;. In 1997, Bishop caused considerable controversy within his own party by cosponsoring a bill by U.S. Representative Ernest Istook to introduce a constitutional amendment to protect religious expression on public property, known as the H. J. Res, 78, the Religious Freedom Amendment. The wording of the amendment allowing the practice of religion on public property, most notably public schools:

To secure the people&#x27;s fight to acknowledge God according to the dictates of conscience: The people&#x27;s right to pray and to recognize their religious beliefs, heritage and traditions shall not be infringed. The Government shall not require any person to join in prayer or other religious activity, prescribe school prayers, discriminate against religion, or deny equal access to a benefit on account of religion ... The people&#x27;s right to pray and to recognize their religious beliefs, heritage, or traditions on public property, including schools, shall not be infringed. 
On October 10, 2002, Bishop was one of only four of 36 Congressional Black Caucus members to vote for the joint resolution authorizing the Iraq War. The other three Congressional Black Caucus members who voted for the resolution are no longer members of Congress: Bill Jefferson, Albert Wynn, and Harold Ford Jr.

On September 10, 2007, Bishop endorsed Barack Obama for President and co-chaired the Georgia for Obama campaign; his wife, Vivian Creighton Bishop, a municipal court clerk in Columbus, co-chaired the Georgia Women for Hillary committee.

Bishop serves on the Appropriations Committee, and chairs the Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies.

Bishop voted to provide Israel with funding in the 2023 Gaza-Israel conflict.

In 2025, Bishop was one of 46 House Democrats who joined all Republicans to vote for the Laken Riley Act.

===Controversies===
In September 2010, the Associated Press reported that Bishop had, between 2003 and 2005, directed scholarships and awards funded by the Congressional Black Caucus to ineligible persons, including his stepdaughter, Aayesha Owens Reese; his niece, Emmaundia J. Whitaker; and other people with close ties to his family, threatening to turn the program into a political problem for the party. Ashton McRae released a statement by Bishop&#x27;s office: &quot;It is our understanding that the CBC Foundation in 2008 revisited the guidelines and processes for its scholarship programs, and as such, included language to clarify that CBC family members are not eligible to receive the scholarships. These scholarships ... were awarded prior to 2008.&quot; Ultimately Bishop&#x27;s spokesman said he would repay the scholarship fund for any awards he made in violation of the rules. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington mentioned Bishop in its annual Most Corrupt Members of Congress report in 2011.

In 1997, the &quot;Pigford v. Glickman&quot; lawsuit came out of legislative discrimination against black farmers. The case was led by Timothy Pigford and 400 black farmers. &quot;The Washington Times&quot; reported that by the end of the case in 1999, over 94,000 claims were filed in conjunction with the original case, &quot;even though the U.S. Census Bureau never counted more than 33,000 black farmers in America during the years in question.&quot; In February 2011, three farmers brought allegations of fraud to Bishop, including Eddie Slaughter, vice president of the Black Farmers and Agriculturalists Association. Bishop told &quot;The Albany Herald&quot; that he was aware of fraud in the program, but that the settlement&#x27;s anti-fraud provisions would prevent disbursement of funds to those who didn&#x27;t qualify. Interviews with Slaughter have circulated online and criticism has been raised about his comments about fraud allegations leading to the end of the program.

In 2020, the Office of Congressional Ethics released a report alleging Bishop misused over $90,000 of campaign funds to cover personal expenses like fuel, golf expenses, meals, travel, tuition and entertainment. A full House Ethics Committee investigation was subsequently launched.

<text>James Creel Marshall (born March 31, 1948) is an American attorney who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from 2003 to 2011. Marshall, a Democrat from Georgia, represented a district based in Macon that also included much of rural Central Georgia. His district was numbered the from 2003 to 2007 and the from 2007 to 2011.

Marshall served as president of the United States Institute of Peace from September 2012 to January 2014. In 2013, British Advocacy organization Action on Armed Violence listed Marshall as one of the 100 more influential people in the world for armed violence reduction.

==Early life, education, and early career==

The son and grandson of army generals, Marshall was born in Ithaca, New York, but moved frequently during his childhood and graduated from the McGill Institute (which later merged with Bishop Toolen to form McGill-Toolen Catholic High School) in Mobile, Alabama. He entered Princeton University in 1966, but left college in 1968 to enlist in the United States Army. He served in Vietnam as an Airborne Ranger reconnaissance platoon sergeant and earned two Bronze Stars (with &quot;V&quot; devices for valor) and a Purple Heart.

On June 29, 2006, Marshall was inducted into the U.S. Army Ranger Hall of Fame. He returned to Princeton in 1970 and graduated in 1972 with an A.B. in politics after completing a senior thesis titled &quot;A Review of Tanzania and the Economics of Underdevelopment.&quot; Marshall worked various jobs for two years before entering law school at Boston University, where he earned his J.D. in 1977.

After clerking for two federal district court judges, Marshall was appointed a professor at Mercer University&#x27;s Walter F. George School of Law in Macon, teaching in the areas of property, commercial, insurance, creditor&#x27;s rights, insolvency, reorganization, and small business law. He was minority recruiter and advisor to the Black Law Student Association at Mercer. From 1987 to 1995, he not only taught at Mercer but also developed a commercial litigation and business insolvency consulting practice, and became involved in civic affairs. Among other things, he served as president of Leadership Macon and the Macon Bar Association. He was also chairman of the Macon Housing Authority. It was during this period that Marshall first became active in politics. He co-chaired the 1990 gubernatorial campaign of former U.S. Congressman and U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., and then as the current mayor of Atlanta, Andrew Young. Young was defeated in a primary run-off against Zell Miller. Marshall also chaired the successful state senate campaign of Robert Brown, the first African American since reconstruction to be elected to that body from outside the Atlanta metro area.

==Mayor of Macon==

From 1995 to 1999, Marshall served as Mayor of Macon. During his tenure, the City of Macon increased its reserves, decreased its debt, lowered its property taxes and acquired a new public safety communications system. Marshall received national news attention for running down (on foot) a felon and encouraging Macon citizens to voluntarily house thousands of refugees from Hurricane Hugo. He was elected to the Advisory Board of the U.S. Conference of Mayors and co-chaired the National Democratic Mayors Conference.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
;2000

Marshall first ran for Congress in 2000 as the Democratic candidate for the 8th District. He was defeated by incumbent U.S. Representative Saxby Chambliss, 59% to 41%. Notably, during his years in Congress, Marshall formed a close working relationship with Chambliss.

;2002

After the 2000 Census, the state legislature carved away much of the heavily Republican southern portion of the old 8th, including Chambliss&#x27; home in Moultrie. They replaced it with some more rural, Democratic-leaning territory around Macon and renumbered it the 3rd District. Marshall defeated Republican Bibb County Commissioner Calder Clay in a race that was expected to be very close. Marshall was hampered by voter anger over Warner Robins being cut out of the district. The reconfigured 3rd included all of Houston County except for a long gash where Warner Robins had been drawn into the 1st District. Marshall also had to contend with the presence of Sonny Perdue (a Houston County resident) atop the ballot as the Republican candidate for governor.

Marshall defeated Clay 51%–49%. Marshall thus became the only white Democrat in Georgia&#x27;s House delegation, and the first since Nathan Deal switched parties in 1995.

;2004

Marshall defeated Clay in their 2004 rematch, winning 63% of the vote, even as George W. Bush won the district with 56% of the vote.

;2006

Early in 2005, the Georgia state legislature, now controlled by Republicans, approved a new map of congressional districts. The Macon-based district was significantly redrawn and renumbered once again as the 8th. The reconfigured 8th was considerably more Republican than its predecessor, even though it included 60% of Marshall&#x27;s former territory as well as all of Macon.

The new district closely resembled the area Chambliss represented for eight years. Had the district existed in 2004, President Bush would have carried it with 61% of the vote.

Marshall&#x27;s Republican opponent was former U.S. Congressman Mac Collins. Collins had represented a district in the southern Atlanta suburbs during his first stint in Congress, but moved back to his native Butts County after it was drawn into the reconfigured 8th. Collins benefited from two visits by President Bush, massive amounts of national party and PAC funding and Perdue&#x27;s presence atop the ticket.

Marshall defeated Collins 51%–49%. It was the second-closest any Democratic incumbent came to losing his seat to a Republican in the 2006 elections. The closest election that year was Georgia Democratic U.S. Congressman John Barrow. As a result, the 8th became one of the most Republican districts in the nation to be represented by a Democrat.

;2008

In 2008, Marshall faced Rick Goddard, who was a retired Air Force major general and the former commander of Warner Robins Air Logistics Center. This race was initially viewed as one of the few where a Republican had a realistic chance of defeating a Democrat. However, Marshall won with 57% of the vote, the same winning percentage that the district gave Republican Presidential nominee John McCain.

;2010

In a landslide year for Republicans, Marshall was defeated 53%–47% by Republican State Representative Austin Scott, a resident of Chambliss&#x27; former base in the district&#x27;s southern portion. Despite Marshall&#x27;s moderate position, Scott successfully painted Marshall as a &quot;Pelosicrat&quot;, accusing him of voting with Nancy Pelosi 80% of the time.

Since Marshall&#x27;s defeat, the Democrats have only nominated a candidate in the 8th twice, both of whom have failed to clear 40 percent of the vote.

===Tenure===

Marshall was a member of the Blue Dog Coalition, a group of conservative congressional Democrats. The National Journal analyzed his voting record as right-of-center, leaning a bit toward the Republican side.

On social issues, Marshall generally voted in line with the conservative bent of his very rural Southern district. He voted to restrict access to legal abortions and supported a constitutional amendment defining marriage as a union between one man and one woman.

On economic issues, Marshall compiled a pro-business record. He was a prominent supporter of the TARP bailout legislation, declaring that he would give up his seat by voting for the bill, which he believed to be essential to avoid a second Great Depression. This issue became a centerpiece of both Marshall&#x27;s successful 2008 re-election and his unsuccessful 2010 campaign. As a senior Democrat on the Agriculture subcommittee regulating futures and derivatives, Marshall was a moderating voice in the regulation of derivatives during the formulation of the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation. Marshall was a consistent supporter of the Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution, and in 2010 he co-founded the Balanced Budget Amendment Caucus. 

Due to his military background, Marshall became a prominent voice on defense matters early in his first term when he won partial repeal of &quot;the Disabled Veterans Tax&quot; (also known as &quot;concurrent receipt&quot;). Marshall&#x27;s one-man campaign brought disabled veterans their first victory on the issue in 19 years, leading the Retired Enlisted Association&#x27;s TREA affiliate to name him legislator of the year for 2003.

In December 2005, Marshall was the sole Democrat to vote against &quot;HR 2863&quot;. This defense appropriations bill, which passed 308–122 with 107 Republicans in support, included language supporting increased protections for detainees held in U.S. custody.

In February 2007, he and Gene Taylor from Mississippi were the only Democrats to vote against &quot;H CON RES 63&quot;, which expressed opposition to a troop surge in the Iraq War. Marshall opposed the non-binding resolution H CON RES 63 because he believed that the only tangible affect it might have was a negative one on troop morale for those charged with executing the surge, as he explained in remarks to Congress.

Along with 38 other Democrats, Marshall voted against the Affordable Health Care for America Act, and explained his reasons to do so in an article in the National Review.

In May 2013, Marshall was named by U.S. Rep. Adam Smith (D-WA) to the National Defense Panel, which assesses the Department of Defense&#x27;s Quadrennial Defense Review.

Marshall was a visiting professor at Princeton University, where he taught in 2011. In February, 2011, he joined the Board of the National Futures Association.

==Personal life==
Marshall lives in Macon with his wife Camille Hope, the daughter of National Hurricane Center meteorologist John Hope, and for whom Hurricane Camille was named. They have two children, Mary and Robert, both of whom attended his alma mater, Princeton University. His great-great-great-grandfather is former U.S. Congressman and famed inventor Hezekiah Bradley Smith.
His grandfather Brigadier General James C. Marshall was the first District Engineer of the Manhattan Engineer District in World War II and as such was the initial commander of the atomic bomb project. His brother Mike Marshall was the long time editor of the Mobile Press-Register.

<doc id="411737" wikidata="Q45380" url="?curid=411737" title="John Lewis">
<text>John Robert Lewis (February 21, 1940 – July 17, 2020) was an American civil rights activist and politician who served in the United States House of Representatives for from 1987 until his death in 2020. He participated in the 1960 Nashville sit-ins and the Freedom Rides, was the chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) from 1963 to 1966, and was one of the &quot;Big Six&quot; leaders of groups who organized the 1963 March on Washington. Fulfilling many key roles in the civil rights movement and its actions to end legalized racial segregation in the United States, in 1965 Lewis led the first of three Selma to Montgomery marches across the Edmund Pettus Bridge where, in an incident that became known as Bloody Sunday, state troopers and police attacked Lewis and the other marchers.

A member of the Democratic Party, Lewis was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1986 and served 17 terms. The district he represented included most of Atlanta. Due to his length of service, he became the dean of the Georgia congressional delegation. He was one of the leaders of the Democratic Party in the House, serving from 1991 as a chief deputy whip and from 2003 as a senior chief deputy whip. He received many honorary degrees and awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011.

== Early life and education ==
John Robert Lewis was born near Troy, Alabama, on February 21, 1940, the third of ten children of Willie Mae (née Carter) and Eddie Lewis. His parents were sharecroppers in rural Pike County, Alabama, of which Troy was the county seat. His great-grandfather, Frank Carter, had been born enslaved in the same county in 1862, and lived until Lewis was seven years old.

As a boy, Lewis aspired to be a preacher, and at age five, he preached to his family&#x27;s chickens on the farm. As a young child, Lewis had little interaction with white people, as his county was majority black by a large percentage and his family worked as farmers. By the time he was six, Lewis had seen only two white people in his life. Lewis recalls &quot;I grew up in rural Alabama, very poor, very few books in our home.&quot; He describes his early education at a little school, walking distances from his home. &quot;A beautiful little building, it was a Rosenwald School. It was supported by the community, it was the only school we had.&quot; &quot;I had a wonderful teacher in elementary school, and she told me &#x27;read my child, read!&#x27; And I tried to read everything. I loved books. I remember in 1956, when I was 16 years old, with some of my brothers and sisters and cousins, going down to the public library, trying to get a library card, and we were told the library was for whites only and not for coloreds.&quot; As he grew older, he began taking trips into Troy with his family, where he continued to have experiences of racism and segregation. Lewis had relatives who lived in northern cities, and he learned from them that in the North, schools, buses, and businesses were integrated. When Lewis was 11, an uncle took him to Buffalo, New York, where he became acutely aware of the contrast with Troy&#x27;s segregation.

In 1955, Lewis first heard Martin Luther King Jr. on the radio, and he closely followed King&#x27;s Montgomery bus boycott later that year. At age 15, Lewis preached his first public sermon. At 17, Lewis met Rosa Parks, notable for her role in the bus boycott, and met King for the first time at the age of 18. In later years, Lewis also credited evangelist Billy Graham, a friend of King&#x27;s, as someone who &quot;helped change me&quot;. Lewis also stated that Graham inspired him &quot;to a significant degree&quot; to fulfill his aspirations of becoming a minister.

After writing to King about being denied admission to Troy University in Alabama, Lewis was invited to meet with him. King, who referred to Lewis as &quot;the boy from Troy&quot;, discussed suing the university for discrimination, but he warned Lewis that doing so could endanger his family in Troy. After discussing it with his parents, Lewis decided instead to proceed with his education at a small, historically black college in Tennessee.

Lewis graduated from the American Baptist Theological Seminary in Nashville, Tennessee, and was ordained as a Baptist minister. He then earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in religion and philosophy from Fisk University, also a historically black college. He was a member of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity.

== Student activism and SNCC ==
=== Nashville Student Movement ===

As a student, Lewis became an activist in the civil rights movement. He organized sit-ins at segregated lunch counters in Nashville and took part in many other civil rights activities as part of the Nashville Student Movement. The Nashville sit-in movement was responsible for the desegregation of lunch counters in the city&#x27;s downtown. Lewis was arrested and jailed many times during the nonviolent activities to desegregate the city&#x27;s downtown businesses. He was also instrumental in organizing bus boycotts and other nonviolent protests to support voting rights and racial equality.

During this time, Lewis said it was important to engage in &quot;good trouble, necessary trouble&quot; in order to achieve change, and he held to this credo throughout his life.

While a student, Lewis was invited to attend nonviolence workshops held at Clark Memorial United Methodist Church by the Rev. James Lawson and Rev. Kelly Miller Smith. Lewis and other students became dedicated to the discipline and philosophy of nonviolence, which he practiced for the rest of his life.

=== Freedom Riders ===
In 1961, Lewis became one of the 13 original Freedom Riders. The group of seven blacks and six whites planned to ride on interstate buses from Washington, D.C. to New Orleans to challenge the policies of Southern states along the route that had imposed segregated seating on the buses, which violated federal policy for interstate transportation. The &quot;Freedom Ride&quot;, originated by the Fellowship of Reconciliation and revived by James Farmer and the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), was initiated to pressure the federal government to enforce the Supreme Court decision in &quot;Boynton v. Virginia&quot; (1960), which declared segregated interstate bus travel to be unconstitutional. The Freedom Rides revealed the passivity of the local, state, and federal governments in the face of violence against law-abiding citizens. The project was publicized and organizers had notified the Department of Justice about it. It relied upon the Alabama police to protect the riders, even though the state was known for notorious racism, and did not undertake actions except assigning FBI agents to record incidents. After extreme violence broke out in South Carolina and Alabama, the Kennedy Administration called for a &quot;cooling-off&quot; period, with a moratorium on Freedom Rides.

In the South, Lewis and other nonviolent Freedom Riders were beaten by angry mobs and arrested. At age 21, Lewis was the first of the Freedom Riders to be assaulted while in Rock Hill, South Carolina. When he tried to enter a whites-only waiting room, two white men attacked him, injuring his face and kicking him in the ribs. Two weeks later Lewis joined a Freedom Ride bound for Jackson, Mississippi. Near the end of his life, Lewis said of this time, &quot;We were determined not to let any act of violence keep us from our goal. We knew our lives could be threatened, but we had made up our minds not to turn back.&quot; As a result of his Freedom Rider activities, Lewis was imprisoned for 40 days in the notorious Mississippi State Penitentiary in Sunflower County.

In an interview with CNN during the 40th anniversary of the Freedom Rides, Lewis recounted the violence he and the 12 other original Freedom Riders endured. In Birmingham, the Riders were beaten by an unrestrained mob including KKK members (notified of their arrival by police) with baseball bats, chains, lead pipes, and stones. The police arrested them, and led them across the border into Tennessee before letting them go. The Riders reorganized and rode to Montgomery, where they were met with more violence at the local Greyhound station. There Lewis was hit in the head with a wooden crate. &quot;It was very violent. I thought I was going to die. I was left lying at the Greyhound bus station in Montgomery unconscious&quot;, said Lewis, remembering the incident.

When CORE gave up on the Freedom Ride because of the violence, Lewis and fellow activist Diane Nash arranged for Nashville students from Fisk and other colleges to take it over and bring it to a successful conclusion.

In February 2009, 48 years after the Montgomery attack, Lewis received a nationally televised apology from Elwin Wilson, a white southerner and former Klansman.

Lewis wrote in 2015 that he had known the young activists Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman from New York. They, along with James Chaney, a local African-American activist from Mississippi, were abducted and murdered in June 1964 in Neshoba County, Mississippi, by members of the Ku Klux Klan including law enforcement.

=== SNCC Chairman ===

In 1963, when Charles McDew stepped down as chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), Lewis, a founding member, was elected to take over. Lewis&#x27;s experience was already widely respected. His courage and tenacious adherence to the philosophy of reconciliation and nonviolence had enabled him to emerge as a leader. He had already been arrested 24 times in the nonviolent movement for equal justice. As chairman of SNCC, Lewis was one of the &quot;Big Six&quot; leaders who were organizing the March on Washington that summer. The youngest, he was scheduled as the fourth to speak, ahead of the final speaker, Dr. Martin Luther King. Other leaders were Whitney Young, A. Philip Randolph, James Farmer, and Roy Wilkins.

Lewis had written a response to Kennedy&#x27;s 1963 Civil Rights Bill. Lewis and his fellow SNCC workers had suffered from the federal government&#x27;s passivity in the face of Southern violence. He planned to denounce Kennedy&#x27;s bill for failing to provide protection for African Americans against police brutality, or to provide African Americans with the means to vote; he described the bill as &quot;too little and too late&quot;. Advance copies of the speech were distributed on August 27 but encountered opposition from the other chairs of the march who demanded revisions. James Forman rapidly re-wrote the speech, replacing Lewis&#x27;s initial assertion &quot;we cannot support, wholeheartedly the [Kennedy] civil rights bill&quot; with &quot;We support it with great reservations.&quot;

After Lewis, Dr. King gave his now celebrated &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech. Historian Howard Zinn later wrote of this occasion:
In 1964, SNCC opened Freedom Schools, launched the Mississippi Freedom Summer for voter education and registration. Lewis coordinated SNCC&#x27;s efforts for Freedom Summer, a campaign to register black voters in Mississippi and to engage college student activists in aiding the campaign. Lewis traveled the country, encouraging students to spend their summer break trying to help people vote in Mississippi, which had the lowest number of black voters and strong resistance to the movement.

In 1965 Lewis organized some of the voter registration efforts during the 1965 Selma voting rights campaign, and became nationally known during his prominent role in the Selma to Montgomery marches. On March 7, 1965 – a day that would become known as &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot; – Lewis and fellow activist Hosea Williams led over 600 marchers across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. At the end of the bridge and the city-county boundary, they were met by Alabama State Troopers who ordered them to disperse. When the marchers stopped to pray, the police discharged tear gas and mounted troopers charged the demonstrators, beating them with nightsticks. Lewis&#x27;s skull was fractured, but he was aided in escaping across the bridge to Brown Chapel, a church in Selma that served as the movement&#x27;s headquarters. Lewis bore scars on his head from this incident for the rest of his life.

Lewis served as SNCC chairman until 1966, when he was replaced by Stokely Carmichael.

== Field Foundation, SRC, and VEP (1966–1977) ==
In 1966, Lewis moved to New York City to take a job as the associate director of the Field Foundation of New York. He was there a little over a year before moving back to Atlanta to direct the Southern Regional Council&#x27;s Community Organization Project. During his time with the Field Foundation, he completed his degree from Fisk University.

In 1970, Lewis became the director of the Voter Education Project (VEP), a position he held until 1977. Though initially a project of the Southern Regional Council, the VEP became an independent organization in 1971. Despite difficulties caused by the 1973–1975 recession, the VEP added nearly four million minority voters to the rolls under Lewis&#x27;s leadership. During his tenure, the VEP expanded its mission, including running Voter Mobilization Tours.

== Early work in government (1977–1986) ==

In January 1977, incumbent Democratic U.S. Congressman Andrew Young of Georgia&#x27;s 5th congressional district resigned to become the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. under President Jimmy Carter. In the March 1977 open primary, Atlanta City Councilman Wyche Fowler ranked first with 40% of the vote, failing to reach the 50% threshold to win outright. Lewis ranked second with 29% of the vote. In the April election, Fowler defeated Lewis 62%–38%.

After his unsuccessful bid, Lewis accepted a position with the Carter administration as associate director of ACTION, responsible for running the VISTA program, the Retired Senior Volunteer Program, and the Foster Grandparent Program. He held that job for two and a half years, resigning as the 1980 election approached.

In 1981, Lewis ran for an at-large seat on the Atlanta City Council. He won with 69% of the vote, and served on the council until 1986.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==
=== Elections ===
==== 1986 ====

After nine years as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Wyche Fowler gave up the seat to make a successful run for the U.S. Senate. Lewis decided to run for the 5th district again. In the August Democratic primary, where a victory was considered tantamount to election, State Senator Julian Bond ranked first with 47%, just three points shy of winning outright. Lewis finished in second place with 35%. In the run-off, Lewis pulled an upset against Bond, defeating him 52% to 48%. The race was said to have &quot;badly strained relations in Atlanta&#x27;s black community&quot; as many Black leaders had supported Bond over Lewis. Lewis was &quot;endorsed by the Atlanta newspapers and a favorite of the white liberal establishment&quot;. His victory was due to strong results among white voters (a minority in the district). During the campaign, he ran advertisements accusing Bond of corruption, implying that Bond used cocaine, and suggesting that Bond had lied about his civil rights activism.

In the November general election, Lewis defeated Republican Portia Scott 75% to 25%.

==== 1988–2018 ====
Lewis was reelected 18 times, dropping below 70 percent of the vote in the general election only once in 1994, when he defeated Republican Dale Dixon by a 38-point margin, 69%–31%. He ran unopposed in 1996, 2004, 2006, and 2008, and again in 2014 and 2018.

He was challenged in the Democratic primary just twice: in 1992 and 2008. In 1992, he defeated State Representative Mable Thomas 76%–24%. In 2008, Thomas decided to challenge Lewis again; Markel Hutchins also contested the race. Lewis defeated Hutchins and Thomas 69%–16%–15%.

=== Tenure ===
==== Overview ====

Lewis represented Georgia&#x27;s 5th congressional district, one of the most consistently Democratic districts in the nation. Since its formalization in 1845, the district has been represented by a Democrat for most of its history.

Lewis was one of the most liberal congressmen to have represented a district in the Deep South. He was categorized as a &quot;Hard-Core Liberal&quot; by On the Issues. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described Lewis in 1998 as &quot;a fiercely partisan Democrat but ... also fiercely independent&quot;. Lewis characterized himself as a strong and adamant liberal. &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; said Lewis was the &quot;only former major civil rights leader who extended his fight for human rights and racial reconciliation to the halls of Congress&quot;. &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; also said that to &quot;those who know him, from U.S. senators to 20-something congressional aides&quot;, he is called the &quot;conscience of Congress&quot;. Lewis cited Florida Senator and later Representative Claude Pepper, a staunch liberal, as being the colleague whom he most admired. Lewis also spoke out in support of gay rights and national health insurance.

Lewis opposed the 1991 Gulf War, and the 2000 U.S. trade agreement with China that passed the House. He opposed the Clinton administration on NAFTA and welfare reform. After welfare reform passed, Lewis was described as outraged; he said, &quot;Where is the sense of decency? What does it profit a great nation to conquer the world, only to lose its soul?&quot; In 1994, when Clinton considered invading Haiti, Lewis opposed armed intervention. After a non-violent transition of power was negotiated, Lewis supported the presence of U.S. troops in Haiti as part of Operation Uphold Democracy, calling the operation a &quot;mission of peace&quot;. In 1998, when Clinton was considering a military strike against Iraq, Lewis said he would back the president if American forces were ordered into action. In 2001, three days after the September 11 attacks, Lewis voted to give President George W. Bush authority to use force against the perpetrators of 9/11 in a vote that was 420–1; Lewis called it probably one of his toughest votes. In 2002, he sponsored the Peace Tax Fund bill, a conscientious objection to military taxation initiative that had been reintroduced yearly since 1972. Lewis was a &quot;fierce partisan critic of President Bush&quot;, and an early opponent of the Iraq War. The Associated Press said he was &quot;the first major House figure to suggest impeaching George W. Bush&quot;, arguing that the president &quot;deliberately, systematically violated the law&quot; in authorizing the National Security Agency to conduct wiretaps without a warrant. Lewis said, &quot;He is not king, he is president.&quot;

Lewis drew on his historical involvement in the Civil Rights Movement as part of his politics. He made an annual pilgrimage to Alabama to retrace the route he marched in 1965 from Selma to Montgomery – a route Lewis worked to make part of the Historic National Trails program. That trip became &quot;one of the hottest tickets in Washington among lawmakers, Republican and Democrat, eager to associate themselves with Lewis and the movement. &#x27;We don&#x27;t deliberately set out to win votes, but it&#x27;s very helpful&quot;, Lewis said of the trip&#x27;.&quot; In recent years, however, Faith and Politics Institute drew criticism for selling seats on the trip to lobbyists for at least $25,000 each. According to the Center for Public Integrity, even Lewis said that he would feel &quot;much better&quot; if the institute&#x27;s funding came from churches and foundations instead of corporations.

On June 3, 2011, the House passed a resolution 268–145, calling for a withdrawal of the United States military from the air and naval operations in and around Libya. Lewis voted against the resolution.

In a 2002 op-ed, Lewis mentioned a response by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to an anti-Zionist student at a 1967 Harvard meeting, quoting &quot;When people criticize Zionists they mean Jews, you are talking anti-Semitism.&quot; In describing the special relationship between African Americans and American Jews in working for liberation and peace, he also gave other statements by King to the same effect, including one from March 25, 1968: &quot;Peace for Israel means security, and we must stand with all our might to protect its right to exist, its territorial integrity. I see Israel as one of the great outposts of democracy in the world, and a marvelous example of what can be done, how desert land can be transformed into an oasis of brotherhood and democracy. Peace for Israel means security and that security must be a reality.&quot;

Lewis &quot;strongly disagreed&quot; with the movement for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) against Israel and co-sponsored resolution condemning the pro-Palestinian group, but he supported Representatives Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib&#x27;s House resolution opposing U.S. anti-boycott legislation banning the boycott of Israel. He explained his support as &quot;a simple demonstration of my ongoing commitment to the ability of every American to exercise the fundamental First Amendment right to protest through nonviolent actions&quot;.

==== Protests ====
In January 2001, Lewis boycotted the inauguration of George W. Bush by staying in his Atlanta district. He did not attend the swearing-in because he did not believe Bush was the true elected president. Later, Lewis joined 30 other House Democrats who voted to not count the 20 electoral votes from Ohio in the 2004 presidential election.

In March 2003, Lewis spoke to a crowd of 30,000 in Oregon during an anti-war protest before the start of the Iraq War. In 2006 and 2009 he was arrested for protesting against the genocide in Darfur outside the Sudanese embassy. He was one of eight U.S. Representatives, from six states, arrested while holding a sit-in near the west side of the U.S. Capitol building, to advocate for immigration reform.

==== 2008 presidential election ====

At first, Lewis supported Hillary Clinton, endorsing her presidential campaign on October 12, 2007. On February 14, 2008, however, he announced he was considering withdrawing his support from Clinton and might instead cast his superdelegate vote for Barack Obama: &quot;Something is happening in America and people are prepared and ready to make that great leap.&quot; Ben Smith of &quot;Politico&quot; said that &quot;it would be a seminal moment in the race if John Lewis were to switch sides.&quot;

On February 27, 2008, Lewis formally changed his support and endorsed Obama. After Obama clinched the Democratic nomination for president, Lewis said &quot;If someone had told me this would be happening now, I would have told them they were crazy, out of their mind, they didn&#x27;t know what they were talking about ... I just wish the others were around to see this day. ... To the people who were beaten, put in jail, were asked questions they could never answer to register to vote, it&#x27;s amazing.&quot; Despite switching his support to Obama, Lewis drew criticism from his constituents for his support of Clinton for several months. One of his challengers in the House primary election set up campaign headquarters inside the building that served as Obama&#x27;s Georgia office.

In October 2008, Lewis issued a statement criticizing the presidential campaign of John McCain and his running mate Sarah Palin and accusing them of &quot;sowing the seeds of hatred and division&quot; in a way that brought to mind the late Gov. George Wallace and &quot;another destructive period&quot; in American political history. McCain said he was &quot;saddened&quot; by the criticism from &quot;a man I&#x27;ve always admired&quot;, and called on Obama to repudiate Lewis&#x27;s statement. Obama responded to the statement, saying that he &quot;does not believe that John McCain or his policy criticism is in any way comparable to George Wallace or his segregationist policies&quot;. Lewis later issued a follow-up statement clarifying that he had not compared McCain and Palin to Wallace himself, but rather that his earlier statement was a &quot;reminder to all Americans that toxic language can lead to destructive behavior&quot;.

On an African American being elected president, he said:After Obama&#x27;s swearing-in ceremony as president, Lewis asked him to sign a commemorative photograph of the event. Obama signed it, &quot;Because of you, John. Barack Obama.&quot;

==== 2016 firearm safety legislation sit-in ====

On June 22, 2016, House Democrats, led by Lewis and Massachusetts Representative Katherine Clark, began a sit-in demanding House Speaker Paul Ryan allow a vote on gun-safety legislation in the aftermath of the Orlando nightclub shooting. Speaker &quot;pro tempore&quot; Daniel Webster ordered the House into recess, but Democrats refused to leave the chamber for nearly 26 hours.

==== National African American Museum ====
In 1988, the year after he was sworn into Congress, Lewis introduced a bill to create a national African American museum in Washington. The bill failed, and for 15 years he continued to introduce it with each new Congress. Each time it was blocked in the Senate, most often by conservative Southern Senator Jesse Helms. In 2003, Helms retired. The bill won bipartisan support, and President George W. Bush signed the bill to establish the museum, with the Smithsonian&#x27;s Board of Regents to establish the location. The National Museum of African American History and Culture, located adjacent to the Washington Monument, held its opening ceremony on September 25, 2016.

==== 2016 presidential election ====

Lewis supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries against Bernie Sanders. Regarding Sanders&#x27; role in the civil rights movement, Lewis remarked &quot;To be very frank, I never saw him, I never met him. I chaired the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee for three years, from 1963 to 1966. I was involved in sit-ins, in the Freedom Rides, the March on Washington, the March from Selma to Montgomery ... but I met Hillary Clinton&quot;. Former Congressman and Hawaii Governor Neil Abercrombie wrote a letter to Lewis expressing his disappointment with Lewis&#x27;s comments about Sanders. Lewis later clarified his statement, saying &quot;During the late 1950s and 1960s when I was more engaged, [Sanders] was not there. I did not see him around. I have never seen him in the South. But if he was there, if he was involved someplace, I was not aware of it ... The fact that I did not meet him in the movement does not mean I doubted that Senator Sanders participated in the civil rights movement, neither was I attempting to disparage his activism.&quot;

In a January 2016 interview, Lewis compared Donald Trump, then the Republican front-runner for the presidential nomination, to former Alabama Governor George Wallace: &quot;I&#x27;ve been around a while and Trump reminds me so much of a lot of the things that George Wallace said and did. I think demagogues are pretty dangerous, really ... We shouldn&#x27;t divide people, we shouldn&#x27;t separate people.&quot;

On January 13, 2017, during an interview with NBC&#x27;s Chuck Todd for &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, Lewis stated: &quot;I don&#x27;t see the president-elect as a legitimate president.&quot; He added, &quot;I think the Russians participated in having this man get elected, and they helped destroy the candidacy of Hillary Clinton. I don&#x27;t plan to attend the inauguration. I think there was a conspiracy on the part of the Russians, and others, that helped him get elected. That&#x27;s not right. That&#x27;s not fair. That&#x27;s not the open, democratic process.&quot; Trump replied on Twitter the following day, suggesting that Lewis should &quot;spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to [...] mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results&quot;, and accusing Lewis of being &quot;All talk, talk, talk – no action or results. Sad!&quot; Trump&#x27;s statement about Lewis&#x27;s district was rated as &quot;Mostly False&quot; by PolitiFact, and he was criticized for attacking a civil rights leader such as Lewis, especially one who was brutally beaten for the cause, and especially on Martin Luther King weekend. Senator John McCain acknowledged Lewis as &quot;an American hero&quot; but criticized him, saying: &quot;this is not the first time that Congressman Lewis has taken a very extreme stand and condemned without any shred of evidence for doing so an incoming president of the United States. This is a stain on Congressman Lewis&#x27;s reputation – no one else&#x27;s.&quot;

A few days later, Lewis said that he would not attend Trump&#x27;s inauguration because he did not believe that Trump was the true elected president. &quot;It will be the first (inauguration) that I miss since I&#x27;ve been in Congress. You cannot be at home with something that you feel that is wrong, is not right&quot;, he said. Lewis had failed to attend George W. Bush&#x27;s inauguration in 2001 because he believed that he too was not a legitimately elected president. Lewis&#x27;s statement was rated as &quot;Pants on Fire&quot; by PolitiFact.

==== 2020 presidential election ====
Lewis endorsed Joe Biden for president on April 7, 2020, a day before Biden effectively secured the Democratic nomination. He recommended Biden pick a woman of color as his running mate.

=== Committee assignments ===

Lewis served on the following Congressional committees at the time of his death:
* Committee on Ways and Means
** Subcommittee on Oversight (Chair)
* United States Congress Joint Committee on Taxation

=== Caucus memberships ===
Lewis was a member of over 40 caucuses, including:
* Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Caucus (Co-Chair)
* Congressional Structured Settlements Caucus (Co-Chair)
* Congressional Black Caucus
* Congressional Progressive Caucus
* Congressional Brazil Caucus
* Congressional Arts Caucus

In 1991, Lewis became the senior chief deputy whip in the Democratic caucus.

== Biographies ==

Lewis&#x27;s 1998 autobiography &quot;Walking with the Wind: A Memoir of the Movement&quot;, co-written with Mike D&#x27;Orso, won the Robert F. Kennedy Book Award, the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award, the Christopher Award and the Lillian Smith Book Award. It appeared on numerous bestseller lists, was selected as a &quot;New York Times&quot; Notable Book of the Year, was named by the American Library Association as its Nonfiction Book of the Year, and was included among &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2009 list of &quot;50 Books For Our Times&quot;. It was critically acclaimed, with &quot;The Washington Post&quot; calling it &quot;the definitive account of the civil rights movement&quot; and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; proclaiming it &quot;destined to become a classic in civil rights literature&quot;.

His life is also the subject of a 2002 book for young people, &quot;John Lewis: From Freedom Rider to Congressman&quot;. In 2012, Lewis released &quot;Across That Bridge&quot;, written with Brenda Jones, to mixed reviews. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;s review said, &quot;At its best, the book provides a testament to the power of nonviolence in social movements ... At its worst, it resembles an extended campaign speech.&quot;

=== &quot;March&quot; (2013)===
In 2013, Lewis became the first member of Congress to write a graphic novel, with the launch of a trilogy titled &quot;March&quot;. The &quot;March&quot; trilogy is a black and white comics trilogy about the Civil Rights Movement, told through the perspective of civil rights leader and U.S. Congressman John Lewis. The first volume, &quot;March: Book One&quot; is written by Lewis and Andrew Aydin, illustrated and lettered by Nate Powell and was published in August 2013, the second volume, &quot;March: Book Two&quot; was published in January 2015 and the final volume, &quot;March: Book Three&quot; was published in August 2016.

In an August 2014 interview, Lewis cited the influence of a 1958 comic book, &quot;Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story&quot;, on his decision to adapt his experience to the graphic novel format. &quot;&quot; became a number one &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller for graphic novels and spent more than a year on the lists.

&quot;March: Book One&quot; received an &quot;Author Honor&quot; from the American Library Association&#x27;s 2014 Coretta Scott King Book Awards, which honors an African American author of a children&#x27;s book. &quot;Book One&quot; also became the first graphic novel to win a Robert F. Kennedy Book Award, receiving a &quot;Special Recognition&quot; bust in 2014.

&quot;March: Book One&quot; was selected by first-year reading programs in 2014 at Michigan State University, Georgia State University, and Marquette University.

&quot;March: Book Two&quot; was released in 2015 and immediately became both a &quot;New York Times&quot; and &quot;Washington Post&quot; bestseller for graphic novels.

The release of &quot;March: Book Three&quot; in August 2016 brought all three volumes into the top 3 slots of the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list for graphic novels for 6 consecutive weeks. The third volume was announced as the recipient of the 2017 Printz Award for excellence in young-adult literature, the Coretta Scott King Award, the YALSA Award for Excellence in Nonfiction, the 2016 National Book Award in Young People&#x27;s Literature, and the Sibert Medal at the American Library Association&#x27;s annual Midwinter Meeting in January 2017.

The &quot;March&quot; trilogy received the Carter G. Woodson Book Award in the Secondary (grades 7–12) category in 2017.

=== &quot;Run&quot; (2018)===
In 2018, Lewis and Andrew Aydin co-wrote another graphic novel as a sequel to the &quot;March&quot; series entitled &quot;Run&quot;, which documents Lewis&#x27;s life after the passage of the Civil Rights Act. The authors teamed with illustrator Afua Richardson for the book, which was originally scheduled to be released in August 2018, but was later rescheduled. It was released on August 3, 2021, a year after his death, as it was one of his last endeavours before he died. Nate Powell, who illustrated &quot;March&quot;, also contributed to the art.

== Personal life ==
===Marriage and family===
Lewis met his future wife Lillian Miles at a New Year&#x27;s Eve party hosted by Xernona Clayton. Lillian worked for the library of Atlanta University at the time. The two of them married one year later in 1964. In 1966, they had a son, who also works in politics. Lillian died on December 31, 2012, the 45th anniversary of the couple&#x27;s meeting. He has a grandson who lives in Paris.

=== Illness and death ===
On December 29, 2019, Lewis announced that he had been diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer. He remained in the Washington D.C. area for his treatment. Lewis stated: &quot;I have been in some kind of fight – for freedom, equality, basic human rights – for nearly my entire life. I have never faced a fight quite like the one I have now.&quot;

On July 17, 2020, Lewis died in Atlanta at the age of 80, on the same day in the same city as his friend and fellow civil rights activist C.T. Vivian. Lewis had been the final surviving &quot;Big Six&quot; civil rights icon.

Then-president Donald Trump ordered all flags to be flown at half-staff in response to Lewis&#x27;s death. Condolences also came from the international community, with Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven, French President Emmanuel Macron, Irish President Michael D. Higgins among others, all memorializing Lewis.

=== Funeral services ===
Public ceremonies honoring Lewis began in his hometown of Troy, Alabama at Troy University, which had denied him admission in 1957 due to racial segregation. His casket was then taken for a memorial held at the historic Brown Chapel AME Church in Selma, Alabama. Calls to rename the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, in Lewis&#x27;s honor grew after his death. On July 26, 2020, his casket, carried in a horse-drawn caisson, traveled the same route over the bridge that he walked during the Bloody Sunday march from Selma to Montgomery, before his lying in state at the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery.

United States House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that Lewis would lie in state in the United States Capitol Rotunda on July 27 and 28, with a public viewing and procession through Washington, D.C. He is the first African-American lawmaker to be so honored in the Rotunda; in October 2019 his colleague, representative Elijah Cummings, lay in state in the Capitol Statuary Hall. Health concerns related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic led to a decision to have his casket displayed outdoors on the East Front steps during the public viewing hours, rather than the usual line of people in the Rotunda filing past the casket to pay their respects. On July 29, 2020, Lewis&#x27;s casket left the U.S. Capitol and was transported back to Atlanta, Georgia, where he lay in state at the Georgia State Capitol.

Among the distinguished speakers at his final funeral service at Atlanta&#x27;s Ebenezer Baptist Church were former U.S. Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama, who gave the eulogy. Former President Jimmy Carter, unable to travel during the COVID-19 pandemic due to his advanced age, sent a statement to be read during the service. The then-current President Donald Trump did not attend the service. Lewis was buried at Atlanta&#x27;s historic South-View Cemetery.

Lewis penned an op-ed to the nation that was published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on the day of his funeral. In it, he called on the younger generation to continue the work for justice and an end to hate.

== Honors ==

Lewis was honored by having the 1997 sculpture by Thornton Dial, &quot;The Bridge&quot;, placed at Ponce de Leon Avenue and Freedom Park, Atlanta, dedicated to him by the artist. In 1999, Lewis was awarded the Wallenberg Medal from the University of Michigan in recognition of his courageous lifelong commitment to the defense of civil and human rights. In that same year, he received the Four Freedoms Award for the Freedom of Speech.

In 2001, the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation awarded Lewis the Profile in Courage Award &quot;for his extraordinary courage, leadership and commitment to civil rights&quot;. It is a lifetime achievement award and has been given out only twice, John Lewis and William Winter (in 2008). The next year he was awarded the Spingarn Medal from the NAACP.
 In 2004, Lewis received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member James Earl Jones.

In 2006, he received the U.S. Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards for Public Service. In September 2007, Lewis was awarded the Dole Leadership Prize from the Robert J. Dole Institute of Politics at the University of Kansas.

Lewis was the only living speaker from the March on Washington present on the stage during the inauguration of Barack Obama. Obama signed a commemorative photograph for Lewis with the words, &quot;Because of you, John. Barack Obama.&quot;

In 2010, Lewis was awarded the First LBJ Liberty and Justice for All Award, given to him by the Lyndon Baines Johnson Foundation, and the next year, Lewis was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama.

In 2016, it was announced that a future United States Navy underway replenishment oiler would be named . Also in 2016, Lewis and fellow Selma marcher Frederick Reese accepted Congressional Gold Medals which were bestowed to the &quot;foot soldiers&quot; of the Selma marchers. The same year, Lewis was awarded the Liberty Medal at the National Constitution Center. The prestigious award has been awarded to international leaders from Malala Yousafzai to the 14th Dalai Lama, presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton and other dignitaries and visionaries. The timing of Lewis&#x27;s award coincided with the 150th anniversary of the 14th amendment. In 2020, Lewis was awarded the Walter P. Reuther Humanitarian Award by Wayne State University, the UAW, and the Reuther family.

Lewis gave numerous commencement addresses, including at the School of Visual Arts (SVA) in 2014, Bates College (in Lewiston, Maine) and Washington University in St. Louis in 2016, Bard College and Bank Street College of Education in 2017, and Harvard University in 2018.

Lewis was recognized for his involvement with comics with the 2017 Inkpot Award.

On July 30, 2018, the Atlanta City Council voted to rename Atlanta&#x27;s Freedom Parkway &quot;John Lewis Freedom Parkway&quot;. On November 5, 2020, the Metropolitan Council of Nashville and Davidson County voted to rename an extensive part of Nashville, Tennessee&#x27;s 5th Avenue &quot;John Lewis Way&quot;.

On June 23, 2020, the Fairfax County Public School Board voted to change the name of Robert E. Lee High School to John R. Lewis High School which is located in Springfield, Virginia. A program called John Lewis Now was created in his vision to provide students with in-school curriculum and out-of-school experiences in leadership and government utilizing the nearby Washington D.C. area.

Lewis&#x27;s death in July 2020 has given rise to support for renaming the historically significant Pettus bridge in Lewis&#x27;s honor, an idea previously floated years ago. After his death, the Board of Fairfax County Public Schools announced that Robert E. Lee High School in Springfield, Virginia would be renamed John R. Lewis High School.

Following his death, Troy University announced that the main building on its flagship campus would bear the name of John Lewis. The building, which was the oldest on campus, was previously named after Bibb Graves, a former governor of Alabama and high-ranking officer of the Ku Klux Klan.

On August 1, 2020, a statue of Lewis was revealed by sculptor Gregory Johnson. The statue was commissioned by Rodney Mims Cook Jr. and was installed at Cook Park in Atlanta, Georgia, in April 2021.
On February 21, 2021, President Joe Biden marked Lewis&#x27;s late birthday on Twitter, urging all Americans to &quot;carry on his mission in the fight for justice and equality for all.&quot; He tweeted, &quot;While my dear friend may no longer be with us, his life and legacy provide an eternal moral compass on which direction to march. May we carry on his mission in the fight for justice and equality for all.&quot;

On October 27, 2021, the University of California, Santa Cruz named one of its residential colleges, formerly known as College Ten, John R Lewis College.
On August 16, 2024, a statue of Lewis by Basil Watson was installed in Decatur, Georgia, in the place where an obelisk monument to the Confederacy was put by the United Daughters of the Confederacy in 1908; the obelisk was removed in 2020.

Lewis was portrayed by Stephan James in the 2014 film &quot;Selma&quot;. He made a cameo appearance in the music video for Young Jeezy&#x27;s song &quot;My President&quot;, which was released in the month of Obama&#x27;s inauguration. In 2017, John Lewis voiced himself in the &quot;Arthur&quot; episode &quot;Arthur Takes a Stand&quot;. Lewis&#x27;s life was chronicled in the 2017 PBS documentary &quot;John Lewis: Get in the Way&quot; and the 2020 CNN Films documentary &quot;John Lewis: Good Trouble&quot;.

Lewis appeared in the 2019 documentary &quot;Bobby Kennedy for President&quot;, in which Lewis commends Robert F. Kennedy especially in regards to his support for civil rights throughout his time as a senator for New York and during Kennedy&#x27;s 1968 presidential campaign. Lewis also recounted his deep sorrow following the 1968 assassinations of Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.

Lewis appeared alongside Amandla Stenberg to present &quot;Green Book&quot; as a nominee for Best Picture at the 91st Academy Awards that took place on February 24, 2019.

Lewis attended comics conventions to promote his graphic novel, most notably San Diego Comic-Con, which he attended in 2013, 2015, 2016, and 2017. During the 2015 convention, Lewis led, along with his graphic novel collaborators Andrew Aydin and Nate Powell, an impromptu simulated Selma civil rights march arm in arm with children, during which he wore the same clothes as he did on Bloody Sunday, garnering thousands of con goers to participate. The event became so popular it was repeated in 2016 and 2017.

<text>John Hardy Isakson (December 28, 1944 – December 19, 2021) was an American businessman and politician who served as a United States senator from Georgia from 2005 to 2019. A member of the Republican Party, he previously served in the Georgia legislature and the United States House of Representatives.

Born in Atlanta, Georgia, Isakson served in the Georgia Air National Guard (1966–1972) and graduated from the University of Georgia. He opened a real estate branch for Northside Realty and later served 22 years as the company&#x27;s president. After a failed bid for the Georgia House of Representatives in 1974, he was elected in 1976. He served seven terms, including four as minority leader. Isakson was the Republican candidate for governor of Georgia in 1990, but lost. Two years later, he was elected to the Georgia Senate and served one term. He unsuccessfully ran in the Republican primary in the 1996 U.S. Senate election.

After 6th District Congressman and Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich resigned, Isakson ran in the February 1999 special election to succeed him, winning by a 40-point margin. He ran for the U.S. Senate in 2004 after Democratic incumbent Zell Miller opted not to run for re-election. With the backing of much of Georgia&#x27;s Republican establishment, he won both the primary and general elections by wide margins. He became the senior senator from Georgia when Saxby Chambliss retired in 2015. On December 31, 2019, midway through his third Senate term, Isakson resigned from the Senate due to health concerns and was succeeded by fellow Republican Kelly Loeffler who was appointed by Brian Kemp, the Republican Governor of Georgia, to fill the vacant seat. He died two years later on December 19, 2021.

==Early life, education, and real estate career==
Isakson was born on December 28, 1944, in Atlanta, Georgia, the son of Julia (&quot;née&quot; Baker) and Edwin Andrew Isakson, a Greyhound bus driver, who later established an Atlanta real estate firm. His paternal grandparents were of Swedish descent, and his paternal grandfather was born in Östersund. His mother was of mostly British ancestry, and her family has been in the American South since the colonial era.

Isakson served in the Georgia Air National Guard from 1966 to 1972, leaving service as a staff sergeant. Isakson enrolled at the University of Georgia, where he became a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon social fraternity. Shortly after graduating from UGA, he opened the first Cobb County office of Northside Realty, a prominent Atlanta-area real estate firm that his father, Ed, helped to establish. Isakson became company president in 1979, a post he held for 22 years, during which Northside became the biggest independent real estate company in the Southeast and one of the largest in the United States.

==Early political career (1974–1998)==
===Georgia House of Representatives===
In 1974, Isakson first ran for the Georgia House of Representatives in an eastern Cobb County district and lost. He ran again in 1976 and won. He served seven terms in the House. He won re-election unopposed in 1984 and 1988. In his last four terms (1983–1990), he was the Republican Minority leader. In 1988 and 1996, he was co-chair for U.S. Senator Bob Dole&#x27;s presidential primary campaigns.

===1990 gubernatorial election===
Isakson was the Republican candidate for Governor of Georgia in 1990. He won the Republican primary with 74% of the vote in a four candidate field. In the general election, he was defeated by Democratic Lieutenant Governor Zell Miller 53%–45%. His campaign was managed by Jay Morgan while Miller&#x27;s campaign was managed by James Carville. Miller ran on a pledge to start a state lottery and use the revenue for public schools. Isakson proposed a ballot referendum on the lottery.

===Georgia Senate===

In 1992, Isakson was elected to the Georgia Senate.

===1996 U.S. Senate election===

In 1996, Isakson ran in the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by retiring Democratic U.S. Senator Sam Nunn. During his campaign, Isakson expressed his support for abortion rights in a campaign advertisement. Isakson finished second in the primary election with 35% of the vote, but the winner Guy Millner, a millionaire businessman, failed to get a majority of the vote (receiving only 42%). Therefore, per Georgia law, he was forced into a primary runoff election. Millner defeated Isakson in the runoff 53%–47%. Millner lost the general election to Democrat Max Cleland.

In December 1996, Isakson was appointed head of the State Board of Education by Gov. Zell Miller.

==U.S. House of Representatives (1999–2005)==

===Elections===
;1999
In November 1998, 6th District U.S. Congressman and Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich faced a revolt in his caucus after the Republicans lost five seats in the midterm elections. Amid the turmoil, Gingrich announced on Friday after the Tuesday elections not only that he would not run for a third term as Speaker, but he would also not take his seat for an eleventh term beginning in January 1999. Isakson ran for the seat in a special election in February. He won the election with 65% of the vote, forty points ahead of the second-place finisher Christina Fawcett Jeffrey.

;2000
Isakson won re-election to his first full term with 74.75% of the vote.

;2002
Isakson won re-election to his second full term with 79.87% of the vote. 

===Tenure===
During his tenure in the House of Representatives, Isakson served on the Committee on Education and the Workforce, aiding President Bush in passing the No Child Left Behind Act. As a Representative, Isakson sponsored 27 bills. He was a member of the U.S. House Education Committee. In October 2002, Isakson voted in favor of the authorization of force against the country of Iraq.

==U.S. Senate (2005–2019)==

===Elections===

==== 2004 ====

In early 2003, conservative Democratic U.S. Senator Zell Miller—who had been appointed to fill out the term of the late Republican Senator Paul Coverdell and elected to the post in his own right in 2000—declared his intention not to run for a full term in the Senate in 2004. Isakson immediately entered the race. He faced 8th District U.S. Congressman Mac Collins and businessman Herman Cain in the primary.

It was initially thought Isakson would face a difficult primary since many socially conservative Republicans still felt chagrin at Isakson&#x27;s declared support for abortion rights in 1990. However, he won the Republican primary with 53%, with Cain a distant second and Collins third, averting the need for a runoff. In the general election, he easily defeated the Democratic candidate, 4th District Congresswoman Denise Majette, by 18 points. Isakson&#x27;s election marked the first time in Georgia&#x27;s history that both of the state&#x27;s U.S. Senate seats had been held by Republicans, as Saxby Chambliss had won the other seat by defeating Nunn&#x27;s successor, Max Cleland, two years earlier.

==== 2010 ====

In 2010, Isakson was unopposed in the primary. He won re-election with 58.3% of the vote in 2010, defeating State Commissioner of Labor Mike Thurmond.

==== 2016 ====

Isakson was re-elected to a third term in 2016 with 54.8% of the vote.

===Tenure and legislation===
As a senator, Isakson sponsored or co-sponsored 130 bills, just 8 of which became law.

In 2010, Isakson apologized for referring to voters as &quot;the unwashed&quot; in off-hand comments, saying he &quot;didn&#x27;t mean anything derogatory by it.&quot;

Isakson resigned from the Senate for health reasons on December 31, 2019. He is the longest serving Republican senator in the history of Georgia.

===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Finance
**Subcommittee on International Trade, Customs and Global Competitiveness
**Subcommittee on Social Security, Pensions and Family Policy
**Subcommittee on Taxation and IRS Oversight
*Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions
**Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety (Chairman)
*Committee on Veterans&#x27; Affairs (Chairman)
*Select Committee on Ethics (Chairman)
*Committee on Foreign Relations
**Subcommittee on African Affairs
**Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs

== Political positions ==
When compared to his Republican peers in the Senate, Isakson was close to center of his party; he was neither significantly more conservative nor liberal than his peers.

===Abortion===
During his campaign for U.S. senator in 1996, Isakson expressed his support for abortion rights in a campaign advertisement. In 2005, Isakson reportedly identified himself as pro-life with exceptions. In March 2017, Isakson—who was recovering from back surgery—came to the U.S. Capitol in a wheelchair to vote to repeal an Obama administration rule that had made it unlawful for states to bar abortion providers from receiving Title X funding. The Senate vote on the bill was 50–50, and Vice President Mike Pence cast a tie-breaking vote that allowed the bill to pass.

=== Agriculture ===
In July 2019, Isakson was one of eight senators to introduce the Agricultural Trucking Relief Act, a bill that would alter the definition of an agricultural commodity to include both horticultural and aquacultural products and promote a larger consistency in regulation through both federal and state agencies as part of an attempt to ease regulatory burdens on trucking and the agri-community.

===Gun laws===
In 2017, Isakson said that while he did support concealed carry nationwide, he did not support campus carry and stated that it is &quot;not the appropriate thing to do.&quot;

In February 2018, in response to the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Isakson said, &quot;We have to do everything we can within our powers to make sure it never happens again.&quot;

===Healthcare===
Isakson voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and voted more than 60 times to repeal it.

===Immigration===
In 2019, Isakson voted to support President Donald Trump&#x27;s national emergency declaration regarding border security.

==Personal life==
Isakson and his wife, Dianne, were married in 1968, and had three children. His wife is a watercolor artist, and served as honorary co-chair for Marietta&#x27;s Theatre in the Square playhouse in 2007.

===Health and death===
In June 2015, Isakson disclosed that he had been diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease, but added that the diagnosis would not affect his 2016 re-election plans. He continued his campaign and was elected in November 2016 to serve a third six-year term in the Senate. On August 28, 2019, however, Isakson announced that he would resign his Senate seat for health reasons on December 31, 2019.

Isakson died at his home in Atlanta on December 19, 2021, nine days short of his 77th birthday.

<text>Greg the Bunny is an American television sitcom that originally aired on Fox in 2002. It starred Seth Green and a hand puppet named Greg the Bunny, a character originally created by the team of Sean Baker, Spencer Chinoy and Dan Milano. Milano and Chinoy wrote and co-produced the Fox show with Steven Levitan. The show was spun off from &quot;The Greg the Bunny Show&quot;, a series of short segments that aired on the Independent Film Channel, which were based on the public-access television cable TV show &quot;Junktape&quot;. A spin-off show, called &quot;Warren the Ape&quot;, premiered on June 14, 2010, on MTV.

==Plot==
In the FOX show, Greg was the co-star of a children&#x27;s television show called &quot;Sweetknuckle Junction&quot;. Like &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, &quot;Greg the Bunny&quot; treated puppets as though they were real creatures within the reality of the show. Although in this show, they were treated as a racial minority (who prefer to be called by the politically correct term &quot;fabricated Americans&quot;), sometimes struggling against second-class citizenship.

==Characters==
===Humans===
* Gilbert &quot;Gil&quot; Bender (played by Eugene Levy) – The overwhelmed TV producer and director of &quot;Sweetknuckle Junction&quot; and the father of Jimmy Bender. He expects Jimmy to succeed in his life.
* Jimmy Bender (played by Seth Green) – The human roommate of Greg the Bunny and the son of Gil Bender. He was a former pool man before he started working with his father where he hooked Greg up for a part on &quot;Sweetknuckle Junction&quot;. After Greg lands the part on the show, Jimmy becomes the production assistant to his father. In &quot;SK-2.0,&quot; Jimmy temporarily became a creative consultant to help modernize the show. He went back to his production assistant job after &quot;SK-2.0&quot; caused the test audience children to have seizures and the network getting lawsuits from the parents of the children.
* Alison Kaiser (played by Sarah Silverman) – The network executive that Gil Bender works for. She used to work at PBS.
* Jack Mars (played by Bob Gunton) – An actor and Vietnam War veteran who plays Junction Jack, the railroad engineer host of &quot;Sweetknuckle Junction&quot;. Even though he has a distaste for puppets off-camera, Jack is the drinking buddy of Warren DeMontague and Count Frederick Blah. In &quot;SK-2.0,&quot; Jimmy&#x27;s filming of the alter-ego of &quot;Sweetknuckle Junction&quot; called &quot;SK-2.0&quot; had Junction Jack converted to a cyborg named Cybo-Jack who also wears a rocket pack. After the viewing of &quot;SK-2.0&quot; by the test audience children caused them to have seizures and their parents to file lawsuits against the network, Jack started playing Junction Jack again. In &quot;Jewel Heist,&quot; it is revealed that Jack grew up on a farm where his job was to castrate the bull cattle. In &quot;Surprise,&quot; it is revealed that Jack can shoot better when he dresses like a woman. In &quot;Sock Like Me,&quot; Jack&#x27;s reason for his puppet distaste is because his mother had an affair with a puppet while he was a child. This led to Jack&#x27;s mom leaving Jack and his dad where she ran off with the puppet.
* &quot;Dottie&quot; Sunshine (played by Dina Waters) – An actress who is the beautiful human co-host of &quot;Sweetknuckle Junction&quot;. She is more comfortable around most puppets than any other person. In &quot;SK-2.0&quot;, Dottie wore a sexy outfit. When &quot;SK-2.0&quot; fails to pan out where it caused the children test audience to have seizures and the network getting lawsuits from the parents of the children, Dottie goes back to her original outfit. In &quot;Jewel Heist,&quot; it is revealed that Dottie is allergic to bees. In &quot;Greg Gets Puppish,&quot; it is revealed that Dottie had a puppet best friend growing up where Dottie later confesses that the puppet in question was her maid growing up.

===Puppets===
Many puppets have been used on the show. The ones exclusive to the show have been designed and built at Animated Engineering McAvene Designs. Several that appeared on the FOX show were reused from the children&#x27;s direct-to-video series &quot;The Adventures of Timmy the Tooth&quot;, such as some members of the Gingivitis Gang appearing as background crew members.

* Greg the Bunny (performed by Dan Milano) – A rabbit who is the title character of the show. Greg underwent many changes throughout the course of his career. The original Greg had buttons for eyes and did not have a mouth. In the Fox series, he was given a moving mouth and plastic eyes for the later episodes. When Greg the Bunny returned to IFC, his button eyes were restored and he lost his moving mouth. On the show, he acts mostly as comic relief, and jokes are made at his expense (particularly by Warren) about how he cannot act and that he&#x27;s just there to look cute. In the IFC series, he lives with Spencer and Sean. In the Fox series, he lives with Jimmy Bender. Jimmy was the one who got his father Gil to give Greg a job on &quot;Sweetknuckle Junction&quot; where he portrayed himself as the nephew to the former character Rochester Rabbit co-starring alongside Junction Jack, Dottie, Count Blah, and Warren DeMontague. In &quot;SK-2.0,&quot; the &quot;Sweetknuckle Junction&quot; alter-ego &quot;SK-2.0&quot; had Greg the Bunny playing &quot;G. the B.&quot; When &quot;SK-2.0&quot; fails to pan out where it caused the children test audience to have seizures and the network getting lawsuits from the parents of the children, he becomes Greg the Bunny again. In &quot;Greg Gets Puppish,&quot; Greg gets the Puppish name of Bizzleburp from Hurbada Hymena. In the MTV series spin-off &quot;Warren the Ape,&quot; Greg makes an appearance when Warren spends time with him to become sexually abstinent. However, it ends up with the clueless Greg being arrested as a pedophile and losing his virginity while in jail.
* Warren DeMontague (performed by Dan Milano) – A helmet-wearing ape who is the second main character on the show later starring in his own series &quot;Warren the Ape&quot;. He is the only character who uses a separate character name on &quot;Sweetknuckle Junction&quot; playing Professor Ape. He portrays himself as a veteran stage actor trying to make a new name for himself while having several substance-related vices. He initially despises working with Greg the Bunny because of his lack of stage experience. Warren has an agent named Maury who Warren tends to call up for any acting opportunities. In &quot;SK-2.0,&quot; there were fat jokes made about Warren which caused him to strangle the test audience child that insulted him enough for Gil and Alison to break it up. Jimmy&#x27;s plans for the alter-ego of &quot;Sweetknuckle Junction&quot; called &quot;SK-2.0&quot; had him telling Warren to shed some pounds. During the filming of &quot;SK-2.0&quot; under Jimmy&#x27;s supervision, Warren had to operate as &quot;Prof Meister Ape&quot; with Gil eventually telling him to say his lines with feeling or else he&#x27;ll rip the stitches that were placed in his rear and suck out the fat with an industrial vacuum. When &quot;SK-2.0&quot; fails to pan out where it caused the children test audience to have seizures and the network getting lawsuits from the parents of the children, he portrays Professor Ape again. In &quot;Jewel Heist,&quot; it is revealed that Warren had a relationship with Farrah Fawcett.
* Fredrick &quot;Count Blah&quot; Blah (performed by Dan Milano in the IFC show, Drew Massey on the FOX show) – A vampire who is another actor that had worked with Warren DeMontague many years ago. He is a parody of Count von Count of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; fame, although he regularly claims that Count von Count stole his act and took away his fame. In the IFC series, Spencer often asks Blah when directing to stop saying &quot;Blah.&quot; This makes Blah very upset, as he insists that Blah is his gimmick. Blah was another puppet who underwent changes between series. In the IFC series, he has lighter skin and smaller eyes than he does on the Fox show and his hands are those of the assistant puppeteers.
* Tardy Turtle (performed by Victor Yerrid) – A turtle exclusive to the FOX show. He is portrayed as slow (hence his name), in the sense that he is regularly late as well as likely being mentally handicapped and often saying non sequiturs (&quot;Crayons taste like purple,&quot; &quot;... the green ones make me horny,&quot; &quot;... drumsticks can also be chicken&quot;) in a similar manner of Ralph Wiggum from &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Tardy also ends some of his sentences or when he is frightened with a high-pitched squeal much like Leonardo DiCaprio&#x27;s character in &quot;What&#x27;s Eating Gilbert Grape&quot;. In the opening credits, it&#x27;s said that he graduated from Harvard at the head of his class, indicating that there is a possibility that he is a savant. When FOX cancelled the series, the puppet was &quot;stolen&quot; and FOX claimed copyright to it. A puppet that resembles Tardy makes an appearance in one of the pre-episode audio introductions on the IFC DVD.
* Susan Monster (performed by James Murray) – A full-bodied furry purple monster with six breasts and a male voice who is exclusive to the FOX series. She works as an office worker at the network where &quot;Sweetknuckle Junction&quot; is filmed. In &quot;Welcome to Sweetknuckle Junction,&quot; Susan was among the puppets who auditioned for Rochester Rabbit&#x27;s part. In &quot;Surprise,&quot; Susan is revealed to have a habit of eating stray cats. When FOX cancelled the series, they claimed copyright to Susan Monster&#x27;s puppet.
* Rochester Rabbit (performed by James Murray) – A gruff rabbit born in 1946 who was the previous puppet host of &quot;Sweetknuckle Junction&quot; for 15 years until he was fired due to forgetting his lines at his age and was replaced by Greg the Bunny. He is mentioned to have 43 kids. After Greg the Bunny landed Rochester&#x27;s part on &quot;Sweetknuckle Junction&quot; as Rochester&#x27;s nephew, Rochester crashed the filming of the show and threatened to cut him up with scissors only for him to be knocked out by Jimmy during the on-set skirmish between Warren and Jack. In &quot;Rabbit Redux,&quot; Greg&#x27;s recurring nightmares of Rochester burying him alive causes Greg to want to patch things up with him. Greg and Jack find Rochester selling Stars Maps with Jack hoping to get back the meatloaf pan that Rochester borrowed from him. Rochester rants about how Greg stealing his part on &quot;Sweetknuckle Junction&quot; caused him to lose his home and go broke. Greg convinced Gil to rehire Rochester which resulted in Rochester behind hired as a janitor. Greg even fakes an injury so that Rochester can get a part on the Thanksgiving episode of &quot;Sweetknuckle Junction&quot;, where he dances during one of the musical numbers until he suddenly dies from a heart attack. During the memorial service/roast, some jokes are made about Rochester followed by a presentation where Rochester got hurt during each episode. When it came to Warren&#x27;s talk about Rochester, the cigar that was placed in Rochester&#x27;s dead mouth started to burn Rochester&#x27;s dead body.
* Cranky (performed by Victor Yerrid) – A crew member who is often annoyed at things. He is a recycled version of Cavity Goon from &quot;The Adventures of Timmy the Tooth&quot;.
* Dr. Aben Mitchell (performed by Drew Massey) – The leader of the Pro-Puppet Movement and an advocate on Puppet Rights. Being a Live-Hand Puppet, Massey is assisted in performing him by James Murray.
* Gay Bear (performed by Drew Massey) – A bear that acts gay. He was among the puppets that auditioned for Rochester Rabbit&#x27;s part on &quot;Sweetknuckle Junction&quot; in the episode &quot;Welcome to Sweetknuckle Junction&quot;.
* Mr. Hygiene (performed by Victor Yerrid)
* Hurbada Hymena (performed by Drew Massey) – The leader of the militant puppet group called International Puppets Alliance.
** Mushma and Ratagaba (performed by James Murray and Drew Massey) – Two members of the International Puppets Alliance that work for Hurbada. Mushma is a furry one-eyed monster and Ratagaba is a tall-headed goat-like creature.
* Crippled Writer (performed by Victor Yerrid) – A leg brace-wearing writer at the network who is exclusive to the FOX series. In &quot;The Singing Mailman,&quot; the Crippled Writer&#x27;s forearm crutches were once stolen by Leo Kornelly after he had a fall and nobody has come to help the Crippled Writer up.
* Jamaican Guy (performed by James Murray) – A Jamaican puppet who provides the piano music for &quot;Sweetknuckle Junction&quot;. Similar to Count Blah saying &quot;Blah,&quot; Jamaican Guy says &quot;Mon&quot; at the end of his sentences as seen in &quot;Dottie Heat&quot; during their card game with Warren, Jack, a dog puppet, and an unnamed crew member.
* The Wumpus (performed by Dan Milano) – A monster exclusive to the IFC show. He is a parody of the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; Monsters and is very clumsy. The Wumpus, created by Chris Bergoch, first appeared in the early nineties in a Bergoch short.
* Pal Friendlies (performed by Dan Milano) – A character exclusive to the IFC show. He is the talent agent for all the puppets who work on the show, albeit a very ineffective one. He also doubles as a lawyer in some episodes.
* Elephant Man (performed by Paul McGinnis) – A puppet character modeled after Joseph Merrick, exclusive to the IFC show.

==Background and production==
&quot;Junktape&quot; was a half-hour, bi-weekly public access series created by Sean S. Baker, Spencer Chinoy, and Dan Milano. Airing on New York City&#x27;s Manhattan Neighborhood Network, Monday nights at 11:30 pm, the show eventually got the attention of the Independent Film Channel and was given its own series of regular segments starring one of the main characters from &quot;Junktape&quot;, Greg the Bunny. &quot;The Greg the Bunny Show&quot; on IFC involved Greg and other characters introducing independent films being screened by using skits that parodied the films.

The Fox show made its debut in March 2002 and its last episode aired in August 2002, with two episodes unaired. Its failure was largely ascribed to the showrunner and networks&#x27; seeming cluelessness as to the direction they wanted the show to take. The network promoted &quot;Greg the Bunny&quot; as a puppet show for adults, but within the show itself, they insisted on toning down its edgier aspects. The creators felt these changes caused the show to lose something, and gave it much more of a traditional sitcom feel. The showrunner and the network also wanted to focus the show more on the human cast, while the creators maintained that the puppets were the heart of the show. Despite these problems, the series acquired a significant cult following, and was eventually released on DVD in 2004.

In August 2005, the series returned to IFC, in a series of short segments, spoofing both old and new films, including &quot;Annie Hall&quot;, &quot;Miller&#x27;s Crossing&quot;, &quot;Barton Fink&quot;, &quot;Fargo&quot;, &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;, &quot;Easy Rider&quot; and &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. The cast for these segments primarily features puppets Greg and Warren Demontague, with appearances from Count Blah, new character Pal Friendlies, and returning character The Wumpus. Howver, Tardy the Turtle and Susan were unable to appear, as they belong to FOX.

* Peter Griffin mentions &quot;Greg the Bunny&quot; at the beginning of the &quot;Family Guy&quot; comeback episode &quot;North by North Quahog&quot;, when he lists the shows that &quot;Family Guy&quot; was cancelled to &quot;make room for&quot; (roughly shows that were cancelled and their entire run was between the original cancellation and return of &quot;Family Guy&quot;). As he says &quot;Greg the Bunny&quot;, he moves his head toward Chris, referencing the fact that Seth Green, one of the stars in &quot;Greg the Bunny&quot;, is also Chris&#x27; voice actor.
* An original Greg the Bunny short was created by Dan Milano for the 100th episode of the podcast &quot;Star Wars Action News&quot;. While no other puppets were featured, the skit showed Greg playing with his favorite Star Wars action figures. Creator Dan Milano also was featured in a second, separate, video segment.
*Footage of the show can be seen in Sean Baker&#x27;s &quot;Starlet&quot; and &quot;The Florida Project&quot;.

<doc id="411742" wikidata="Q1626247" url="?curid=411742" title="John Linder">
<text>John Elmer Linder (born September 9, 1942) is an American politician who was a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1993 to 2011. His district was numbered the from 1993 to 1997, the from 1997 to 2003, and the from 2003 until 2011. He is a member of the Republican Party.

Linder announced that he would retire from Congress at the end of the 111th Congress. In March 2019, he was announced as President Donald Trump&#x27;s nominee to be the next United States Representative to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations; Linder was not confirmed and his nomination expired at the end of the Trump administration.

==Early life, education, and career==
He was born in Deer River, Minnesota, was educated at the University of Minnesota Duluth, served in the United States Air Force, was a dentist and businessman, president of a lending institution, and a member of the Georgia House of Representatives where he served for seven terms.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Committees assignments===
* Committee on Ways and Means
** Subcommittee on Oversight
** Subcommittee on Income Security and Family Support (Ranking Member)
** Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures

===Party leadership===
* Republican Steering Committee

Linder chaired the National Republican Congressional Committee, the campaign funding arm of House Republicans, during the 105th Congress. He was defeated for a second term as chairman after a poor showing in the 1998 mid-term elections.

In the 109th and 110th Congresses, Linder took a leadership role in the effort to enact fundamental tax reform. His legislation, the &quot;Fair Tax Act, 2005&quot; () and the &quot;Fair Tax Act, 2007&quot; (), was a proposal for changing United States tax laws to replace all federal personal income taxes, payroll taxes, corporate taxes, capital gains taxes, self-employment taxes, gift taxes and inheritance taxes with a national retail sales tax and monthly tax rebate to households of citizens and legal resident aliens.

In 2006, he voted against renewal of the Voting Rights Act.

==Fair Tax Act==
Linder is coauthor of &quot;The FairTax Book&quot; with radio talk show host Neal Boortz, which spent time atop the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list. The book discusses H.R.25 , also known as the &quot;Fair Tax Act&quot;, which Linder sponsored. They released a follow-up book &quot;&quot; in 2008.

Linder first introduced the legislation in July 1999 to the 106th United States Congress. He has reintroduced substantially the same bill in each subsequent session of Congress. While the proposed bill has yet to have a major effect on the tax system, the &quot;Fair Tax Act&quot; has the highest number of cosponsors among tax reform proposals (attracting 76 in the 110th United States Congress), gathering much stronger support than popular flat tax legislation. A number of congressional committees have heard testimony on the FairTax; however, it has not been voted on in either Chamber. The bill is cosponsored by former Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert, but has not received support from the Democratic leadership. Matching legislation has been introduced into the Senate by Georgia Republican Senator Saxby Chambliss.

==Interest groups==
Linder has worked with interest groups such as Americans for Fair Taxation as well as National Taxpayers Union. Since 1996 Linder has backed the National Right to Life Committee 100 percent of the time. Since 1996 Linder has backed the U.S. Chamber of Commerce at least 90 percent of the time except in 2005 where he backed them 75 percent of the time. Throughout his career he has supported groups like National Small Business Association, National Association of Manufacturers, National Restaurant Association, and Small Business &amp; Entrepreneurship Council. He also has backed the interests of the NRA throughout his career.

==Campaign finance==
A former dentist, Linder has received $40,100 from health professionals as well as $57,900 from the health sector as a whole. He also ran his own lending firm so he receives backing from the Insurance and Finance sector amounting to $86,839 as 12/31/2008. He has received $25,401 from the Construction industry and $25,300 from the Energy and Natural Resources industry. Overall in the 2008 cycle he has a total income of $581,976 of which he spent $375,540, and by the end of the cycle he had accumulated no debt at all.

==Voting record==
Linder opposes abortion and has voted for anti-abortion legislation.

Linder voted against a minimum wage increase in 2007. Linder voted against the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

He voted in favor of the Military Commissions Act of 2006. He voted in favor of reauthorizing the PATRIOT Act in 2005. He opposed transferring prisoners from the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.

Linder voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the related Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. He voted against the 2008 Medicare bill that was vetoed by George W. Bush. He voted against the re authorization of the State Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) in 2007, and voted against the Family and Medical Leave Act in 1993.

He voted against reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act in 2006.

In 2006, he co-sponsored a measure to repeal the estate tax.

Linder voted in favor of the &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell&quot; Amendment in 1993, and voted against the Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell Repeal Act of 2010. He voted against the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007. In 2006, Linder voted in favor of the Federal Marriage Amendment (H.J. Res. 88), proposing an amendment to the United States Constitution to ban same-sex marriage.

Linder voted against legislation to limit the federal government&#x27;s authority to prosecute medical marijuana users in states where medical marijuana is legal.

Linder voted against the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 and voted against the American Clean Energy and Security Act (H.R. 2454), which would have established a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions. He voted against measures to shield the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge from drilling. He voted against the Water Resources Development Act of 2007. He voted against establishing the Sedona-Red Rock National Scenic Area and expanding the Casa Grande Ruins National Monument.

Linder voted against the DREAM Act, which would benefit undocumented youth who were brought to the United States as children. He voted in favor of Secure Fence Act of 2006, legislation to create a fence along the U.S.-Mexico border. He voted in favor of the Real ID Act of 2005. In 1996, he voted to designate English as the official national language.

In 1997, Linder voted for an amendment calling for the U.S. to withdraw from the United Nations; the amendment was rejected in a 54–369 vote.

==Criticisms==

===FairTax presentation===
Some have criticized Linder, Neal Boortz, and Americans For Fair Taxation for the way they have presented the FairTax plan, a tax reform that replaces all federal income taxes with a single national sales tax on personal consumption above poverty level. The most common critique is the method of presenting the FairTax rate as a 23% sales tax. Under the plan, consumers would pay to the government $23 out of every $100 (referred to as &quot;tax inclusive&quot;): items priced at $100 would contain $23 of taxes. American sales taxes have historically been expressed as a percentage of the original sale price (referred to as &quot;tax exclusive&quot;): items produced at $77 pre-tax, cost $100 with the tax added (30% on top of $77). Congressman John Linder has stated that the FairTax would be implemented as an inclusive tax, which would include the tax in the retail price, not added on at checkout—an item on the shelf for five dollars would be five dollars total. The receipt would display the tax as 23 percent of the total. Linder states the FairTax is presented as a 23 percent tax rate for easy comparison to income tax rates (the taxes it would be replacing). Proponents believe it is both inaccurate and misleading to say that an income tax is 23 percent and the FairTax is 30 percent as it implies that the sales tax burden is higher, when in fact the burden of the two taxes is precisely the same. The plan&#x27;s opponents call the semantics deceptive. FactCheck called the presentation misleading, saying that it hides the real truth of the tax rate.

The FairTax has also been questioned by Social Security groups which believe the economic assumptions of the FairTax are unsound. The basis of the FairTax is that taxes affect economic decisions. The FairTax would remove all payroll taxes. Yet, the impact analysis of Social Security done by the FairTax supporters claims that the FairTax will not change the number of beneficiaries under existing law. Under economic principles normally applied by the Linder and Boortz, removing the cost of participation would increase not only the number of beneficiaries but the size of claims.

===Non-disclosed travel===
Linder has also been criticized for omitting a trip paid for by a client of lobbyist Jack Abramoff from travel disclosure forms, even though he declared it on his personal income filings. According to John Byrne and Ron Brynaert of The Raw Story, &quot;Linder should have filed a travel form shortly after his trip and could have corrected it when he belatedly filed for other trips last year. Failing to properly report sponsored travel is a violation of House rules.&quot;

==Political campaigns==

Linder was first elected to Congress from the newly created 4th District in 1992, defeating state senator Cathey Steinberg by 2,600 votes. He would never face another general election contest anywhere near that close. His district was renumbered as the 11th District in 1997 after Georgia&#x27;s previous congressional map was thrown out as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.

Georgia gained two seats after the 2000 census, but the Georgia state legislature produced a map intended to produce a congressional delegation of seven Democrats and six Republicans. Linder and fellow Republican Bob Barr were drawn into a heavily Republican district that, while retaining Barr&#x27;s district number (the 7th), contained more of the territory Linder had represented for a decade. Linder handily defeated Barr in the 2002 Republican primary, all but assuring him of a sixth term. Linder ran unopposed in 2004. In 2006, he was re-elected with 70.9% of the vote.

<doc id="411747" wikidata="Q2355855" url="?curid=411747" title="History of Chechnya">
<text>The history of Chechnya may refer to the history of the Chechens, of their land Chechnya, or of the land of Ichkeria.

Chechen society has traditionally been organized around many autonomous local clans, called taips. The traditional Chechen saying goes that the members of Chechen society, like its taips, are (ideally) &quot;free and equal like wolves&quot;.

==Prehistoric and archeological finds==
The first known settlement of what is now Chechnya is thought to have occurred around 12500 BCE, in mountain-cave settlements, whose inhabitants used basic tools, fire, and animal hides. Traces of human settlement go back to 40000 BCE with cave paintings and artifacts around Lake Kezanoi.

The ancestors of the Nakh peoples are thought to have populated the Central Caucasus around 10000–8000 BCE. This colonization is thought by many (including E. Veidenbaum, who cites similarities with later structures to propose continuity) to represent the whole Eastern Caucasian language family, though this is not universally agreed upon. The proto-language that is thought to be the ancestor of all Eastern Caucasian (&quot;Alarodian&quot;) languages, in fact, has words for concepts such as the wheel, so it is thought that the region had intimate links to the Fertile Crescent (many scholars supporting the thesis that the Eastern Caucasians originally came from the Northern Fertile Crescent, and backing this up with linguistic affinities of the Urartian and Hurrian languages to the Northeast Caucasus). According to Johanna Nichols, &quot;the Nakh–Dagestanian languages are the closest thing we have to a direct continuation of the cultural and linguistic community that gave rise to Western civilization.&quot;

===Kura-Araxes culture===

Towns were built in the area that is now Chechnya as early as 8000 BCE. Pottery, too, came around the same time, and so did stone weaponry, stone utensils, stone jewelry items, etc. (as well as clay dishes). This period was known as the Kura-Araxes culture. Amjad Jaimoukha notes that there was a large amount of cultural diffusion between the later Kura-Araxes culture and the Maikop culture. The economy was primarily built around cattle and farming.

===Kayakent culture===
The trend of a highly progressive Caucasus continued: as early as 3000–4000 BCE, evidence of metalworking (including copper) as well as more advanced weaponry (daggers, arrow heads found, as well as armor, knives, etc.). This period is referred to as the Kayakent culture, or Chechnya during the Copper Age. Horseback riding came around 3000 BCE, probably having diffused from contact with Indo-European-speaking tribes to the North. Towns found in this period are often not found as ruins, but rather on the outskirts of (or even inside) modern towns in both Chechnya and Ingushetia, suggesting much continuity. There is bone evidence suggesting that raising of small sheep and goats occurred. Clay and stone were used for all building purposes. Agriculture was highly developed, as evidenced by the presence of copper flint blades with wooden or bone handles.

===Kharachoi culture===
The term Kharachoi culture denotes the Early Bronze Age of Chechnya. Clay jugs and stone grain containers indicate a high level of development of trade and culture. Earlier finds show that extensive hunting was still practiced. There was a lack of pig bones, demonstrating that the domestication of pigs hadn&#x27;t yet spread into the region. Iron had replaced stone, bronze and copper as the main substance for industry by the 10th century BCE, before most of Europe or even areas of the Middle East.

===Koban culture===

The Koban culture (the Iron Age) was the most advanced culture in Chechnya before recorded history, and also the most well-known.
It first appeared between 1100 and 1000 BCE. The most well-studied site was on the outskirts of Serzhen-Yurt, which was a major center from around the eleventh to the seventh centuries BCE.

The remains include dwellings, cobble bridges, altars, iron objects, bones, and clay and stone objects. There were sickles and stone grain grinders. Grains that were grown included wheat, rye and barley. Cattle, sheep, goats, donkeys, pigs and horses were kept. There were shops, where artisans worked on and sold pottery, stone-casting, bone-carving, and stone-carving. There is evidence of an advanced stage of metallurgy. There was differentiation of professionals organized within clans. Jaimoukha argues that while all these cultures probably were made by people included among the genetic ancestors of the Chechens, it was either the Koban or Kharachoi culture that was the first culture made by the cultural and linguistic ancestors of the Chechens (meaning the Chechens first arrived in their homeland 3000–4000 years ago). However, the majority of historians disagree, holding the Chechens to have lived in their present-day lands for over 10000 years.

==Theories on origins==
===Migration from the Fertile Crescent c. 10000–8000 BCE===
Johanna Nichols holds that the Nakh were descended from extremely ancient migrations from the Fertile Crescent to the Caucasus, perhaps due to population or political pressures back in the Fertile Crescent. 

==Ancient==
Georgian historian Giorgi Melikishvili posited that although there was evidence of Nakh settlement in the Southern Caucasus areas, this did not rule out the possibility that they also lived in the North Caucasus.

===Invasion of the Cimmerians===
In the 6th and 7th centuries BCE, two waves of invaders—first the Cimmerians, who then rode south and crushed Urartu, and then the Scythians, who displaced them—greatly destabilized the Nakh regions. This became a recurring pattern in Chechen history: invasion from the north by highly mobile plains people, met with fierce and determined resistance by the Chechens, who usually started out losing but then reversed the tide.

===Invasion of the Scythians===
The Scythians started to invade the Caucasus in the 6th century BCE, originally coming from Kazakhstan and the Lower Volga region. The Cimmerians had already pushed the Nakh south somewhat off the plains, and the Scythians forced them into the mountains. Vainakh presence in Chechnya on the Terek almost completely vanished for a while, and Scythians penetrated as far south as the Sunzha. Considering that the Nakh were extremely dependent on the rivers for their very survival, this was a very desperate situation. However, soon, Vainakh settlement reappeared on the Terek in Chechnya. In some areas, the Scythians even penetrated into the mountains themselves. In the 5th century BCE, Herodotus noted that the Scythians were present in the Central North Caucasus.

After the first wave of Scythian assaults, the Nakh began returning to the fertile lowland plains and ousting the invaders, but new waves of Scythians (Sarmatians) arrived, pushing them back into the mountains. Some of the names of tributaries of the Sunzha and Terek rivers make reference to the fierce conflict for control of the rivers: the Valerik (or the Valarg) meant &quot;the dead&quot; in Nakh and the Martan came from a Sarmatian root and meant &quot;the river of the dead&quot;.

It is not known whether this was the first dominant presence of the Ossetians in their modern territory or whether the primary population was still Zygii/Nakh and that it was only after the later Sarmatian invasion that Scythian people became dominant. Amjad Jaimoukha, notably, supports the hypothesis that the Ossetians were the product of multiple migrations. Thus, if this is the case, then the Scythians settled roughly North Ossetia, effectively cutting the Zygii nation in half (Herodotus noted that Zygii were still present west of the Scythians in the Caucasus). The eastern half, then, became the Vainakhs. In other areas, Nakh-speaking peoples and other highlanders were eventually linguistically assimilated by the Alans and merged with them, eventually forming the Ossetian people.

There were various periods of good relations between the Scythians and the Nakh, where there was evidence of extensive cultural exchange. The Nakh were originally more advanced in material culture than the Sarmatians/Scythians, the latter having not known of the potter&#x27;s wheel or foundry work, while the Sarmatians/Scythians originally had superior military skills and social stratification.

Even after the invasion of the Scythians, the Nakh managed to revitalize themselves after it receded. However, they were now politically fractured, with multiple kingdoms, and modern Ossetia, consistent with the theory that they were largely displaced and that Scythians had become dominant there. The Nakh nations in the North Caucasus were often inclined to look south and west for support to balance off the Scythians. The Vainakh in the east had an affinity to Georgia, while the Malkh Kingdom of the west looked to the new Greek kingdom of Bosporus on the Black Sea coast (though it may have also had relations with Georgia as well). Adermalkh, king of the Malkh state, married the daughter of the Bosporan king in 480 BCE. Malkhi is one of the Chechen tukkhums.

Hostilities continued for a long time. In 458 CE, the Nakh allied themselves with Georgian King Vakhtang Gorgasali as he led a campaign against the Sarmatians, in retribution for their raids.

Eventually, relations between the Sarmatians and the Nakh normalized. The Alans formed the multi-ethnic state of Alania, which included many Nakh tribes despite its center being Sarmatian-speaking.

===Durdzuks in the Georgian Chronicles and the Armenian Chronicles===
Ancestors of the modern Chechens and Ingush were known as Durdzuks. Before his death, Targamos [Togarmah] divided the country amongst his sons, with Kavkasos [Caucas], the eldest and most noble, receiving the Central Caucasus. Kavkasos engendered the Chechen tribes, and his descendant, Durdzuk, who took residence in a mountainous region, later called &quot;Dzurdzuketia&quot; after him, established a strong state in the fourth and third centuries BC. Among the Chechen teips, the teip Zurzakoy (:ru:Зурзакой), consonant with the ethnonym Dzurdzuk, live in the Itum-Kale region of Chechnya. In 1926, on the Vashndar river in the Argun gorge of Chechnya, there was a Chechen aul (rural settlement) Zurzuk, now a tract southeast of the village of Ulus-Kert.

&quot;The Armenian Chronicles&quot; mention that the Durdzuks defeated Scythians and became a significant power in the region in the first millennium BC. They allied themselves with Georgia, and helped Georgian King Farnavaz, the first king of Iberia (Kartli) consolidate his reign against his unruly vassals. The alliance with Georgia was cemented when King Farnavaz married a Durdzuk princess.

==Medieval==
During the Middle Ages, the majority of the ancestors of the modern Vainakh are thought to have mostly lived along rivers and in between ridges, in their current ethnic territory. All the valleys in the upper reaches of the Argun, Assa, Darial and Fontanga saw the construction of complex stone architectures such as castles, shrines, churches, burial vaults and towers.

The main body of various Nakh tribes were surrounded by Georgians to the south, Alans to the north and west with Khazars beyond them, and various Dagestani peoples to the east. Those Nakh peoples who were in Georgia assimilated into Georgian society. The Nakh on the northern side of the Greater Caucasus mountains, ancestors of the Chechens and Ingush, saw some southern tribes adopt Christianity due to Georgian influence in the fifth and sixth centuries, but they remained separate from Georgia. Instead, the areas that now make up Ingushetia and Chechnya were either ruled by Khazars, by Alans, or ruled by independent Vainakh states such as Durdzuketia and Simsir.

===Politics and trade===

By the early medieval ages, Vainakh society had become stratified into a feudal order, with a king and vassals. The Vainakh state was variously called Durdzuketia (or Dzurdzuketia) by the Georgians or Simsir by others, though they may not have been exactly similar. The origin of the more modern egalitarianism among the Vainakh is much later, after the end of the conflict with the Mongols, when the Vainakh eventually grew tired of the excesses of their feudal rulers and overthrew them (see Ichkeria section), establishing what Turkic peoples called Ichkeria.

At various times Vainakh came under the rule of the Sarmatian-speaking Alans to their west and Khazars to their north, in both cases as vassals or as allies depending on time period. In times of complete independence, they nonetheless tried to have strong bonds of friendship with these countries both for trade and military purposes. The Vainakh also forged strong links with Georgia for mutual protection as well as trade, and these were initially in the context of the threat of an Arab invasion (as happened to Caucasian Albania) in the 8th century. The contribution of the Vainakh to fending off Arab designs on the Caucasus was critical.

The Vainakhs were also engaged in much trade as per their geographical position with long range trade partners (long range for the time period). Excavations have shown the presence of coins and other currency from Mesopotamia in the Middle East, including an eagle cast in Iraq (found in Ingushetia) and buried treasure containing 200 Arabian silver dirhams from the 9th century in northern Chechnya.

===Religion===
Until the 16th century, Chechens and Ingush were mostly pagans, practicing the Vainakh religion, with a sizable minority of Orthodox Christians. From the 8th to 13th centuries (i.e., before Mongol invasions of Durdzuketia), there was a mission of Georgian Orthodox missionaries to the Nakh peoples. Their success was limited, though a couple of highland teips did convert (conversion was largely by teip). However, during the Mongol invasions, these Christianized teips gradually reverted to paganism, perhaps due to the loss of trans-Caucasian contacts as the Georgians fought the Mongols and briefly fell under their dominion.

===Durdzuketia and Simsir===

During the Middle Ages, two states evolved in Chechnya that were run by Vainakhs. The first was Durdzuketia, which consisted of the highlands of modern Chechnya, Ingushetia, the Prigorodny District of North Ossetia, and parts of central Chechnya and Ingushetia. It was allied to Georgia, and had heavy Georgian influence, permeating in its writing, in its culture and even in religion. Christianity was introduced from Georgia in the 10th century and became, briefly, the official religion, despite the fact that most of the people remained pagan. Georgian script was also adopted, though this has been mostly lost by now. Durdzuketia was destroyed by the Mongol invasions.

Simsir was a principality, and unlike Durdzuketia, it frequently switched around its alliances. Despite common ethnic heritage with Durdzuketia, it was not always linked to its southern neighbor, although it was in certain periods. It was located roughly where today&#x27;s Gudermes and Nozhay-Yurt district are situated, on, along and around the Sunzha and Terek rivers. One should note that northwest Chechnya and northern Ingushetia were never part of its dominion, or of Durdzuketia&#x27;s, but were in fact ruled by the Alans. It originally also had lands in southeast Chechnya as well, but over the course of its existence, it became more and more focused on the Sunzha river as the core of its statehood. It soon allied itself with the Golden Horde and adopted Islam afterwards. However, this proved to be a mistake as the alliance bound it to war with Tamerlane, who invaded and destroyed it.

==Mongol invasions==

During the 13th century, the Mongols and their Turkic vassals launched long and massive invasions of the territory of modern Chechnya (then the Georgian allied Vainakh kingdom of Durdzuketia). They caused massive destruction and human death for the Durdzuks, but also greatly shaped the people they became afterward. The ancestors of the Chechens bear the distinction of being one of the few peoples to successfully resist the Mongols, not once, but twice, but this came at great cost to them, as their state was utterly destroyed.

These invasions are among the most significant occurrences in Chechen history, and have had long-ranging effects on Chechnya and its people. The determination to resist the Mongols and survive as Vainakh at all costs cost much hardship on the part of ordinary people. There is much folklore on this among the modern Chechen and Ingush. One particular tale recounts how the former inhabitants of Argun and the surrounding area held a successful defense (waged by men, women, and children) of the slopes of Mount Tebulosmta during the First Mongol Invasion, before returning to reconquer their home region.

Fierce resistance did not prevent the utter destruction of the state apparatus of Durdzuketia, however. Pagan sanctuaries as well as the Orthodox Churches in the south were utterly destroyed. Under the conditions of the invasion, Christianity (already originally highly dependent on connections with Georgia) was unable to sustain itself in Durdzuketia, and as its sanctuaries and priests fell, those who had converted reverted to paganism for spiritual needs. Historical documents were also destroyed in mass amounts. Within a few years of the invasion, Durdzuketia was history– but its resistant people were not. Even more disastrously, the Mongols successfully established control over much of the Sunzha river– thus posing an existential threat to the Durdzuk people due to their need for the Sunzha&#x27;s (as well as the Terek&#x27;s) agriculture to support their population. The feudal system of vassals and lords also fell into shambles.

The utter destruction of the Vainakh&#x27;s statehood, their lifestyle (and in the south, their religion), and much of their knowledge of history caused them to rebuild their culture in many ways. The population developed various methods of resistance and much of their later lifestyle during the resistance to the Mongols and in between the two wars. The clan system mapped onto battlefield organization. Guerrilla tactics using mountains and forests were perfected. It was during the Mongol invasions that the military defense towers that one associates today with the Vainakh population (see Nakh architecture) came into being. Many served simultaneously as homes, as sentry posts, and as fortresses from which one could launch spears, arrows, etc. The contribution of men, women, and children of all classes, paired with the destruction of the feudal system during the war, rich and poor, also helped the Vainakh develop a strong sense of egalitarianism, which was one of the major causes of the revolt against their new lords after the end of the Mongol invasions.

==Modern era==

===Post-Mongol era transition===
After defending the highlands, the Vainakh attacked Mongol control of the lowlands. Much of this area still had nominal Vainakh owners (as per the clan system which acknowledges the ownership of a piece of land by a certain teip), even after generations upon generations of not living there. Much territory was retaken, only to be lost again due to the Second Mongol Invasion. After that, the Vainakh managed to take most (but not all) of their former holdings on the Sunzha, but most of the Terek remained in Kipchak hands. The conflicts did not stop, however, as there were clans that had ownership of lands now inhabited by Turkic peoples, meaning that if they did not retake the lands, they would lack their own territory and be forever reliant on the laws of hospitality of other clans, doing great damage to their honor. Conflicts between Vainakh and Turkic peoples originated from the Mongol invasions when Chechens were driven out of the Terek and Sunzha rivers by Turco-Mongolian invaders and continued as late as the 1750s and 1770s. After that, the conflict was with newer arrivals in northern Chechnya: the Cossacks.

The large-scale return of Vainakh from the mountains to the plains began in the early 15th century (i.e., right after the end of the Second Mongol Invasion) and was completed at the beginning of the 18th century (by which point the invasion of Chechnya by Cossacks was approaching). The Nogais were driven north, and some of those who stayed behind (as well as some Kumyks) may have been voluntarily assimilated by the Chechens, becoming the Chechen clans of Turkic origin.

Although the Chechens now reoccupied the northern Chechen plains, the lords of the Kumyks and Kabardins sought to rule over their lands just as they had attempted to do (with varying success) with the Nogais in the area. The Kabardins established rule over the Ingush clans, but the Kumyks found the plains Chechens to be very rebellious subjects, who only grudgingly acknowledged their rule. In the lands of central and southern Chechnya, Chechens from around the Sunzha, who had advanced socially, economically and technologically much more than their highland counterparts, established their own feudal rule. The feudal rulers were called byachi, or military chieftains. However, this feudalism, whether by Kumyks, Avars, Kabardins or Chechens, was widely resented by the Chechens, and the spread of gunpowder and guns allowed for a massive revolution to occur.

===Ichkeria===

The name (Ičkérija) comes from the river Iskark in south-eastern Chechnya. The term was mentioned first as &quot;Iskeria&quot; in a Russian document by Colonel Pollo from 1836.

The &quot;illesh&quot;, or epic legends, tell of conflicts between the Chechens and their Kumyk and Kabardin overlords. The Chechens apparently overthrew both their own overlords and the foreign ones, using the widespread nature of the guns among the populace to their advantage. As Jaimoukha puts it, &quot;based on the trinity of democracy, liberty and equality&quot;, feudalism was abolished and the &quot;tukkhum-taip&quot; legal system was put into place, with the laws of adat introduced. The &quot;tukkhum-taip&quot; system had democratic aspects with the strong role of local courts and teips (roughly, clans) functioning as provinces, with representatives being elected by teip as well as by region.

==Ottoman-Persian rivalry and the Russian Empire==
The onset of Russian expansionism to the south in the direction of Chechnya began with Ivan the Terrible&#x27;s conquest of Astrakhan. Russian influence started as early as the 16th century when Ivan the Terrible constructed a fort in Tarki in 1559 where the first Cossack army became stationed. The Russian Terek Cossack Host was secretly established in lowland Chechnya in 1577 by free Cossacks resettled from Volga River Valley to the Terek River Valley. With the new Cossack hosts settled in the proximity of the North Caucasian peoples and with the rivaling Ottoman and Persian empires from the south, the region would for the next few centuries be contested between the three, with Russia emerging as victorious only in the late 19th century, after multiple victorious wars against Iran, Turkey, and the native Caucasian peoples later on.

=== Ottoman-Safavid and later Ottoman-Persian-Russian rivalry in the Caucasus ===
Beginning in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, the Ottoman and Safavid empires started to fight for influence over the Caucasus. Many Caucasian peoples grew wary of both sides and attempted to play one side off against the other. The rivalry was embodied by both the struggle between Sunni and Shia Islam and the regional conflict of the two empires. Originally, relations with Russia were seen as a possible balance to the Ottoman and Safavid empires, and a pro-Russian camp in Chechen politics formed (there were also pro-Ottoman and pro-Persian camps; each viewed their favored empire as the least bad of the three). In reality, the most favored empire from the beginning was the Ottoman Empire, but that did not mean the Chechens were not wary of a potential Ottoman attempt at conquering them. Any hope toward positive relations with Russia ended in the late 18th and early 19th centuries when tensions with the Cossacks escalated and Russia began trying to conquer the Caucasus, starting with Georgia. After this point, many Chechens sealed, forever, their preference towards Istanbul against Isfahan and Moscow by converting to Sunni Islam in an attempt to win the sympathy of the Ottomans. However, they were too late – the Ottoman Empire was already well into its period of decline and collapse, and not only was it no longer willing to assist Muslims (especially newly converted people, who were viewed as &quot;less Muslim&quot; than peoples with a long Islamic heritage), but it was no longer able to even maintain its own state. Hence, the rivalry between Turkey and Persia became more and more abstract and meaningless as the threat of conquest by Russia and being pushed out of their lands or even annihilated by the Cossacks grew and grew.

====Arrival of the Cossacks====
The Cossacks, however, had settled in the lowlands just a bit off from the Terek river. This area, now around Naurskaya and Kizlyar was an area of dispute between the Mongols&#x27; Turkic vassals and their successors (the Nogais) and the Chechens. The mountainous highlands of Chechnya were economically dependent on the lowlands for food produce, and the lowlands just north of the Terek river were considered part of the Chechen lowlands. The Cossacks were much more assertive than the Nogais (who quickly became vassals to the Tsar), and they soon replaced the Nogais as the regional rival. This marked the beginning of Russo-Chechen conflict, if the Cossacks are to be considered Russian. The Cossacks and Chechens would periodically raid each other&#x27;s villages, and seek to sabotage each other&#x27;s crops, though there were also long periods without violence.

Nonetheless, the Chechen versus Cossack conflict has continued to the modern day. It was a minor theme in the works of Leo Tolstoy (who managed to be sympathetic both to the Chechens and to the Cossacks). While the Chechens and Ingush primarily backed the anti-Tsarist forces in the Russian Revolution, because of this, and the threat to the Decossackization policies of the Bolsheviks, the Terek Cossacks almost universally filed into the ranks of Anton Denikin&#x27;s anti-Soviet, highly nationalistic Volunteer Army.

The habit of raids done by the Chechens (and to a lesser extent Ingush) against Cossacks, by the 20th century, had more or less become a cultural tradition. Both hatred of the oppressor (Chechens generally failed to see the distinction between Russian and Cossack, and to this day they may be used as synonyms) and the need to either fill the mouths of hungry children and to regain lost lands played a role. The Chechen raiders, known as &quot;abreks&quot;, were the focal point of this conflict and are almost symbolic of the two different viewpoints. The Russian view of the &quot;abreks&quot; is that they were simple mountain bandits, a typical example of Chechen barbarism (often compared to Russian &quot;civilization,&quot; with general colonialist racist vocabulary); they were depicted as rapists and murderers by Russian authors. The Chechen view is that they were heroes of valor, much like Robin Hood. As Moshe Gammer points out in his book &quot;Lone Wolf and Bear&quot;, Soviet ideology fell somewhere in between the two views- and notably, one such &quot;abrek&quot;, Zelimkhan, was deified.

===Russo-Persian Wars and Caucasian Wars===

As Russia set off for the first time to increase its political influence in the Caucasus and the Caspian Sea at the expense of Safavid Persia, Peter I launched the Russo-Persian War (1722-1723), in which Russia succeeded in taking much of the Caucasian territories from Iran for several years. 

As the Russians took control of the Caspian corridor and moved into Persian ruled Dagestan, Peters&#x27; forces ran into mountain tribes. Peter sent a cavalry force to subdue them, but the Chechens routed them. In 1732, after Russia already ceded back most of the Caucasus to Persia, now led by Nader Shah, following the Treaty of Resht, Russian troops were ambushed by Chechen rebels near a village called Chechen–Aul along the Argun River. The Russians were defeated again and withdrew, but this battle is responsible for the apocryphal story about how the Nokhchiy came to be known as &quot;Chechens&quot; – the people ostensibly named for the place the battle had taken place at. The ethnonym Chechen was, however, already in use as early as 1692.

In 1783, Russia and the eastern Georgian kingdom of Kartl-Kakheti signed Treaty of Georgievsk. Kartli-Kakheti, led by Erekle II, seeing that Persia was trying to put Georgia again under Persian rule, urged for the treaty which he hoped would guarantee Russian protection in the future. However, this did not prevent Persia which had been ruling Georgia intermittently since 1555, now led by Agha Mohammad Khan of the Qajar dynasty, from sacking Tbilisi in 1795, and regaining full control over Georgia. This act gave Russia the direct option to push deeper into the Caucasus per the signed treaty with Georgia.

The spread of Islam was largely aided by Islam&#x27;s association with resistance against Russian encroachment from the 16th to the 19th centuries.

===Conquest===
In order to secure communications with Georgia and other future regions of the Transcaucasia, the Russian Empire began spreading its influence into the Caucasus mountains. The Chechens were actually first drawn into conflict with Russia when Russia attacked the Kumyks (and established the fort of Kizlyar), whom the Chechens were allied to. Russia&#x27;s Cossacks became imperial extensions and Russia sent its own soldiers to meet the escalating conflict (which was no longer simply between Russian and Kumyk). It soon met with fierce resistance from the mountain peoples. The Russians incorporated a strategy of driving the Chechens into the mountains, out of their lowland (relative) food source, thus forcing them to either starve or surrender. They were willing to do neither. The Chechens moved to retake the lowlands: in 1785, a holy war was declared on the Russians by Sheikh Mansur, who was captured in 1791 and died a few years later. Nonetheless, expansion into the region, usually known at this point as Ichkeria, or occasionally Mishketia (probably coming from Kumyk or Turkish; also rendered Mitzjeghia, etc.), was stalled due to the persistence of Chechen resistance.

Following the incorporation of neighbouring Dagestan into the empire after its forced ceding by Persia in 1803–1813 following the Russo-Persian War (1804–1813) and the outcoming Treaty of Gulistan, Imperial Russian forces under Aleksey Yermolov began moving into highland Chechnya in 1830 to secure Russia&#x27;s borders with Persia. Another successful Caucasus war against Persia several years later, starting in 1826 and ending in 1828 with the Treaty of Turkmenchay, and a successful war against Ottoman Turkey in 1828 enabled Russia to use a much larger portion of its army in subdueing the natives of the North Caucasus.

In the course of the prolonged Caucasian War, the Chechens, along with many peoples of the eastern Caucasus, united into the Caucasian Imamate and resisted fiercely, led by the Dagestani commanders Ghazi Mohammed, Hamzat Bek and Imam Shamil (for military details, see Murid War). While their program of united resistance to Russian conquest was popular, uniting Ichkeria/Mishketia with Dagestan was not necessarily (see Shamil&#x27;s page), especially as some Chechens still practiced the indigenous religion, most Chechen Muslims belonged to heterodox Sufi Muslim teachings (divided between Qadiri and Naqshbandiya, with a strong Qadiri majority), rather than the more orthodox Sunni Islam of Dagestan; and finally, the rule of Ichkeria by a foreign ruler not only spurred distrust, but also threatened the existence of Ichkeria&#x27;s indigenous &quot;taip-conference&quot; government structure. Thus, Shamil was regarded by many Chechens as simply being the lesser evil. Shamil was an Avar who practiced a form of Islam that was largely foreign to Chechnya, and in the end, he ended up happy in Russian custody, demonstrating furthermore his lack of compatibility with the leadership of the cause. Worse still, he presented his cause not as a fight for freedom, but also as a fight to purify Islam, and aimed many of his criticisms at fellow Avars as well as Chechen leaders and non-Avar Dagestani leaders. The Chechens, as well as many Dagestanis, fought on even after his defeat, undaunted. In addition to failing to win the sincere support of not only the Chechens, but also the Ingush, and many Dagestani peoples, Shamil also was thwarted in his goal of uniting east Caucasian and west Caucasian resistance (Circassians, Abkhaz, etc.), especially given the conditions of the Crimean War. A major reason for this failure was Russia&#x27;s success in convincing the Ossetes to take their side in the conflict, who followed the same religion (Orthodox Christianity) as them. The Ossetes, living right in between the Ingush and the Circassian federation, blocked all contacts between the two theaters of war.

Chechnya was finally absorbed into the Russian Empire in 1859 after Shamil&#x27;s capture. Imam Shamil, among modern Chechens, is alternately glorified and demonized: his memory is evoked as someone who successfully held off Russian conquest, but on the other hand, he ruled Ichkeria heavy-handedly, and was an Avar who worked mainly for the interest of his own people. Nonetheless, the name Shamil is popular among Chechens, largely due to his legacy.

The Russian generals had a special hatred of Chechens, the most bold and stubborn nation with the most aggravating (for the Russians) guerrilla battlefield tactics. Yermolov stated once that he would &quot;never rest until [only] one Chechen is left alive&quot;. In 1949, Soviet authorities erected a statue of 19th-century Russian general Aleksey Yermolov in Grozny. The inscription read, &quot;There is no people under the sun more vile and deceitful than this one&quot;. As Caucasian historian Charles King points, the methods used by the Russians would today be called genocidal warfare. An example of these tactics (in fact recorded in this case by a Russian officer) by the Russian army and the Cossacks went like this:

At this moment, General Krukovskii, with saber drawn, sent the Cossacks forward to the enemies&#x27; houses. Many, but not all, managed to save themselves by running away; the Cossacks and the militia seized those who remained and the slaughter began, with the Chechens, like anyone with no hope of survival, fought to their last drop of blood. Making a quick work of the butchery, the ataman [Cossack commander] gave out a cry and galloped on to the gorge, toward the remaining villages where the majority of the population was concentrated.

The long and brutal war caused a prolonged wave of emigration until the end of the 19th century, involving hundreds of thousands of Chechens. According to such estimates (Jaimoukha cites the earlier historian A. Rogov), there were as many as 1.5 million Chechens in the North Caucasus in 1847 (and probably many more before that, as there had already been much fighting and destruction by that point), but by 1861 there were only 140,000 remaining in the Caucasus. By 1867, after the wave of expulsions, there were only 116,000 Chechens. Hence, in those 20 years, the number of Chechens decreased by 1,384,000 (or 92.3%).

In the 1860s, Russia commenced with forced emigration as well to ethnically cleanse the region. Although Circassians were the main (and most notorious) victims, the expulsions also gravely affected other peoples in the region. Lowland Chechens as well were evicted in large numbers, and while many came back, the former Chechen Lowlands lacked their historical Chechen populations for a long period until Chechens were settled in the region during their return from their 1944–1957 deportation to Siberia. The Arshtins, at that time a (debatably) separate people, were completely wiped out as a distinct group: according to official documents, 1366 Arshtin families disappeared (i.e. either fled or were killed) and only 75 families remained. These 75 families, realizing the impossibility of existing as a nation of only hundreds of people, joined (or rejoined) the Chechen nation as the Erstkhoi tukkhum.

===Post-conquest===

As Chechens fled and were deported to Turkey, Terek Cossacks and Armenians settled in Chechnya. The presence of Cossacks in particular was resented deeply by the Chechens. Alongside another Russo-Turkish War, the 1877 &quot;Lesser Gazavat&quot; saw the 22-year-old Vainakh imam Ali Bek-Haji rise alongside a rebellion of Avars under Haji Mohammed in Daghestan. The main Chechen force was dispersed by Russian heavy artillery at Mayrtup on May 3 and the leadership was surrounded by November. In December, Ali Bek-Haji and his naibs surrendered upon Russian promises of amnesty but 23 of the 28 were hanged by March 1878. Georgian scholar George Anchabadze noted that this coincided with a major Abkhazian revolt, and is comparable to various earlier mass revolts in the South Caucasus by Georgians, Abkhaz, Transcaucasian Avars, Azeris, Talysh, and Lezghins. All these revolts drew their force from the mass opposition of the population to the brutality and exploitation of Russian colonialist rule (even among peoples like Georgians, Azeris and Talysh who had originally been incorporated relatively easily), and used similar guerrilla tactics. In the aftermath of the uprising, however, many Chechens were dispossessed or exiled to Siberia in favor of local collaborators such as the Cossacks. They subsequently abandoned open &quot;gazavat&quot; (&quot;jihad&quot;) until the 1917 revolutions.

By the end of the 19th century, major oil deposits were discovered around Grozny (1893) which along with the arrival of the railroad (early 1890s), brought economic prosperity to the region (then administered as part of the Terek Oblast) for the oil-mining Russian colonists. The immigration of colonists from Russia brought about a three-way distinction between Chechens and Ingush on one hand, Cossacks on a second, and &quot;other-towners&quot; (inogorodtsy), namely Russians and Ukrainians, who came to work as laborers. A debatable fourth group, including Armenian bankers and richer Russians, and even some rich Chechens (such as Chermoev), arose later.

===Emergence of European-styled nationalism===
During the late 1860s and 1870s (just 10 years after the incorporation of Chechnya into the Tsarist Empire), the Chechens underwent a national reawakening in the European sense of the term. The conflict with Russia and its final incorporation into the empire, however, brought about the formation of a modern, European, nationalist identity of Chechens, though it ironically solidified their separation, mainly over politics, from the Ingush. The nation was held to be all-important, trumping religion, political belief, or any other such distinction.
In 1870, Chakh Akhiev wrote a compilation of Chechen and Ingush fairy tales (called &quot;Chechen fairytales&quot;). In 1872, Umalat Laudaev, an early Chechen nationalist, recorded the contemporary customs of the Chechens. Following in his footsteps, Chakh Akhiev did the same for their &quot;brothers&quot;, the Ingush, the following year.

Other notable early Chechen nationalists included Akhmetkhan, Ibraghim Sarakayev, Ismail Mutushev. Later imperial Chechen nationalists include the five Sheripov brothers, among others. Akhmetkhan and Danilbek Sheripov were notably democratic-minded writers, while Danilbek&#x27;s younger brother, Aslanbek, would adopt communism.

===World War I===
During World War I, Chechens fought for the Imperial Russian Army. In 1916, members of the Checheno-Ingush Cavalry Regiment routed members of the German Iron Regiment, and received a personal thanks from Tsar Nicholas II.

In a report on 5 August 1914, the German Chief of Staff stressed the importance of inciting rebellions among Caucasian Muslims.

==Soviet Union==

===Post World War I chaos===

During the Russian Civil War, the Northern Caucasus switched hands several times between Denikin&#x27;s Volunteer Army, the Bolshevik Red Army and the Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus, which eventually allied with the Bolsheviks as they promised them greater autonomy and self-rule.

Initially, the Chechens, like many other Caucasians, looked very positively upon communism. The indigenous Chechen systems and culture led them to place a high value on equality, and communists promised an end to imperialism (and especially Tsarist rule), making them even more attractive. Furthermore, the majority of Chechens lived in poverty. As was also the case for many Georgians, the cultural tolerance and anti-imperialist rhetoric of communism was what made it so appealing to Chechens (and so terrifying for Cossacks). Many Sufi priests, despite communism&#x27;s contempt for religion, filed into the ranks of the communists as they felt that preserving the morals of their religion (including equality, which the communists stood for) was more important than its practice.

However, like other peoples, divisions arose among the Chechens. The differentiation between classes had by now arisen (or re-arisen) and notably, alliances between the Russians (and other &quot;inogorodtsy&quot;) were also splintered. This, combined with the ethnic division of Chechnya between the natives as well as other non-Christian minorities, the &quot;old colonists&quot; (i.e., Cossacks) and the &quot;recent colonists&quot; (non-Cossack Russians), and the political divisions among each group, led to a complicated conflict pitting many different forces against each other. At only one year into the conflict, five distinct forces with separate interests had formed with influence in Chechnya: the Terek Cossacks, the &quot;Bourgeois&quot; Chechens following Tapa Chermoev, the Qadiri Communist-Islamists under Ali Mitayev, the urban Russian Bolsheviks in Groznyi, and lastly, the relatively insignificant Naqshbandis with loyalties to Islamists in Dagestan.

In response to the February Revolution, the Bolsheviks seized power in the city of Grozny, their stronghold in Chechnya. Meanwhile, a &quot;Civil Executive Committee&quot; was formed in the Terek district by a group of native &quot;bourgeoisie&quot;. It notably included the Chechen oil-magnate Tapa Chermoev in its structures. The Civil Executive Committee was a multi-national organ and included people from many of the ethnic groups of the Caucasus. It nominally accepted the authority of the provisional government in Moscow, but explicitly stated its goal of securing autonomy. A third force, the Terek Cossacks, began organizing to resist the Bolsheviks who had taken control of Grozny (as well as some other cities in the Caucasus). To make matters even more confusing, a group of Naqshbandi Islamists in Dagestan organized under the sheikh and livestock breeder Najmuddin of Hotso and declared a muftiate of the North Caucasus in the summer of 1917, supposedly a successor state to Shamil&#x27;s Caucasus Imamate. The Chechen Qadiri sheikh, Ali Mitayev, a &quot;Communist-Islamist&quot; who believed that Communism was compatible with Qadiri-Sunni Islam, set up a Chechen National Soviet. Mitayev shared the communist ideals of the Russian Bolsheviks in Groznyi, but insisted on Chechen national autonomy as well. As the scenario progressed, Chermoev and the rest of the Civil Executive Committee would temporarily set aside their disdain for the Naqshbandi Islamists and persuade Najmuddin to serve in their government, which evolved from the Civil Executive Committee into a Mountain Republic.

At this point, the clash was between the Whites and the indigenous peoples who opposed them. The Ossetes and Cossacks sided with the Whites, whereas everyone else fought them. This therefore made Bolshevism the lesser evil or even a strong ally against the Whites. The originally reluctant support of the Bolsheviks soon became firm after the Whites began committing massacres against Chechen villages. Tapa Chermoev became the ruler of the Chechen constituent to the &quot;Mountain Republic&quot;. Chermoev ironically allied himself with the Cossacks against the inogorodtsy, who seized power briefly in early 1917. Chermoev and the other major figures among the Mountain Republic sought to incorporate the Cossacks (establishing what would have been essentially the first friendly relations between Chechens and Cossacks- unsurprisingly, the uneasy alliance soon gave way). A Chechen National Soviet was set up under Ali Mitayev. Dagestani Islamists tried to establish an emirate and incorporate the Chechens, but the Chechens wanted nothing to do with them – one of the few things all Chechens, which even the Islamists agreed on (most Chechens were Qadiri, meaning they viewed the Naqshbandi with contempt).

The alliance between the Caucasians and the Cossacks soon disintegrated as the threat posed by the inogorodtsy receded. Chechens and Ingush demanded a return of the lands they had been robbed of in the previous century, and the Chermoev government, increasingly revealed as without any control over its land, despite opposing this (and in doing so, losing the support of its main constituents), was powerless to stop them. Chechens stormed North to reclaim the northern parts of their homeland, and land-hungry, impoverished Chechens revived the practice of attacking the Cossack stanitsas in order to feed their children. As the Chermoev government collapsed, Chechens allied, at least vocally, with the Mensheviks in Georgia, while the Cossacks tried to ally with the Bolsheviks, who, appealing to the Cossacks, referred to the Chechen&#x27;s actions as being symptoms (unfathomably) of &quot;racist bourgeois nationalism&quot; (using bourgeois to refer to a practically impoverished people). However, the Cossacks did not have an affinity to the Bolsheviks, and when the Denikin&#x27;s Whites appeared on the scene, their appeal to Cossacks as Russian patriots, and their contempt for non-Russians resonated strongly with the Cossacks.

The civil war dragged on, and Chechen hopes in the Mensheviks soon were dashed as the Mensheviks became increasingly weakened and lost control of the Northern regions of their own country. The Whites, with their Cossack and Ossetian allies, massacred village after village of Caucasians (it was then that the Georgians of North Ossetia, previously 1-2% of the population, were forced to flee and the rest completely massacred, by the Ossete Whites and Cossacks). The Bolsheviks appealed to the Caucasians (except the Georgians, who remained loyal to the Mensheviks, who they viewed as slowly becoming Georgian patriots), arguing that they now realized that the Cossacks who they had appealed to previously were merely imperial tools, and that, knowing this, they would back Caucasian demands all the way. The Chechens were desperate for any sort of help against the Cossacks, and wanted to reverse the cause of their perennial poverty – the loss of Northern Chechnya to the Cossacks – so they joined the Reds by the thousand.

Originally, the advancing Bolsheviks (who were also mainly ethnically Russian, like the Whites they defeated) were viewed as liberators. However, less than half a year after their arrival, rebellion on the part of the Chechens against the Bolsheviks flared up again, because it was discovered by the Chechens that &quot;the Russian Bolsheviks were just a new kind of imperialist, in Communist disguise&quot;. Following the end of the conflict in 1921, the Chechnya-Ingushetia had been first made part of the Soviet Mountain Republic, and until it was disbanded in 1924 received the official status of an autonomous republic within the Soviet Union in 1936.

===Early inter-war period: the Spring of the 1920s===
===1930s: Stalinist period===
In the 1930s, Chechnya was flooded with many Ukrainians fleeing the great famine known as the Holodomor. Despite the threats from the Soviet government not to provide food and shelter to starving Ukrainians, the rebellious peoples did not follow Soviet orders. As the result many of the Ukrainians settled in Chechen-Ingush ASSR on the permanent basis and were able to survive the famine.

The broke out in early 1932 and was defeated in March.

On December 5, 1936, an Autonomous Soviet Socialist Chechen-Ingush Republic was proclaimed.

===Hassan Israilov&#x27;s rebellion and World War II===
Observing Finland&#x27;s fight against Russia (the Winter War) caused the Chechens to begin to believe that it was then the time to achieve their long-desired liberation from the Russian yoke.

By February 1940, Hasan Israilov and his brother Hussein had established a guerrilla base in the mountains of south-eastern Chechnya, where they worked to organize a unified guerrilla movement to prepare an armed insurrection against the Soviets. In February 1940 Israilov&#x27;s rebel army controlled territory in South and Central Checheno-Ingushetia. The rebel government was established in Galanchozh.

Israilov described his position on why they were fighting numerous times:

&quot;I have decided to become the leader of a war of liberation of my own people. I understand all too well that not only in Checheno-Ingushetia, but in all nations of the Caucasus it will be difficult to win freedom from the heavy yoke of Red imperialism. But our fervent belief in justice and our faith in the support of the freedom-loving peoples of the Caucasus and of the entire world inspire me toward this deed, in your eyes impertinent and pointless, but in my conviction, the sole correct historical step. The valiant Finns are now proving that the Great Enslaver Empire is powerless against a small but freedom-loving people. In the Caucasus you will find your second Finland, and after us will follow other oppressed peoples.&quot;

&quot;For twenty years now, the Soviet authorities have been fighting my people, aiming to destroy them group by group: first the &quot;kulaks&quot;, then the mullahs and the &#x27;bandits&#x27;, then the bourgeois-nationalists. I am sure now that the real object of this war is the annihilation of our nation as a whole. That is why I have decided to assume the leadership of my people in their struggle for liberation.&quot;

After the German invasion in the USSR in June 1941, the brothers organized large meetings in areas not yet taken to gather supporters. In some areas, up to 80% of men were involved in the insurrection. It is known that the Soviet Union used bombers against the rebels causing a large number of civilian casualties. In February 1942, Mairbek Sheripov organized rebellion in Shatoi, Khimokhk and tried to take Itum-Kale. Sheripov and Israilov joined forces soon and began taking control of areas of Western Dagestan. The insurrection caused many Chechen and Ingush soldiers of the Red Army to desert. Some sources claim that total number of deserted mountaineer soldiers reached 62,750, exceeding the number of mountaineer fighters in the Red Army.

The Germans made concerted efforts to coordinate with Israilov. Germany sent saboteurs and aided the rebels at times with Abwehr&#x27;s &quot;Nordkaukasische Sonderkommando Schamil&quot;, which was sent on the premise of saving the oil refinery in Grozny from destruction by the Red Army (which it accomplished). However, Israilov&#x27;s refusal to cede control of his revolutionary movement to the Germans, and his continued insistence on German recognition of Chechen independence, led many Germans to consider Khasan Israilov as unreliable, and his plans unrealistic. Although the Germans were able to undertake covert operations in Chechnyasuch as the sabotage of Grozny oil fieldsattempts at a German-Chechen alliance floundered.

That the Chechens actually were allied to the Germans is highly questionable and usually dismissed as false. They did have contact with the Germans. However, there were profound ideological differences between the Chechens and the Nazis (self-determination versus imperialism), neither trusted the other. The Germans also courted the Cossacks, who were traditionally enemies of the Chechens. Mairbek Sheripov reportedly gave the Ostministerium a sharp warning that &quot;if the liberation of the Caucasus meant only the exchange of one colonizer for another, the Caucasians would consider this [a theoretical fight pitting Chechens and other Caucasians against Germans] only a new stage in the national liberation war&quot;.

===Operation Lentil/Aardakh===

Operation Lentil began on October 13, 1943, when about 120,000 men were moved into the Republic of Checheno-Ingushetia by the Soviet government, supposedly for mending bridges. On February 23, 1944 (on Red Army day), the entire population was summoned to local party buildings where they were told they were going to be deported as punishment for their alleged collaboration with the Germans.

Some 40% to 50% of the deportees were children. Unheated and uninsulated freight cars were used. The inhabitants rounded up and imprisoned in Studebaker trucks and sent to Central Asia (Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan). Many times, resistance was met with slaughter, and in one such instance, in the aul of Khaibakh, about 700 people were locked in a barn and burned alive by NKVD general Gveshiani, who was praised for this and promised a medal by Lavrentiy Beria. Many people from remote villages were executed per Beria&#x27;s verbal order that any Chechen or Ingush deemed &#x27;untransportable should be liquidated&#x27; on the spot. 

By the next summer, Checheno-Ingushetia was dissolved; a number of Chechen and Ingush placenames were replaced with Russian ones; mosques and graveyards were destroyed, and a massive campaign of burning numerous historical Chechen texts was near complete (leaving the world depleted of what was more or less the only source of central Caucasian literature and historical texts except for sparse texts about the Chechens, Ingush, etc., not written by themselves, but by Georgians). Throughout the North Caucasus, about 700,000 (according to Dalkhat Ediev, 724,297, of which the majority, 479,478, were Chechens, along with 96,327 Ingush, 104,146 Kalmyks, 39,407 Balkars and 71,869 Karachais), died along the trip, and the extremely harsh environment of Central Asia (especially considering the amount of exposure) killed many more.

The NKVD gives the statistic of 144,704 people killed in 1944–1948 alone (death rate of 23.5% per all groups), though this is dismissed by many authors such as Tony Wood, John Dunlop, Moshe Gammer and others as a far understatement. Estimates for deaths of the Chechens alone (excluding the NKVD statistic), range from about 170,000 to 200,000, thus ranging from over a third of the total Chechen population to nearly half being killed in those 4 years alone (rates for other groups for those four years hover around 20%). Although the Council of Europe has recognized it as a &quot;genocidal act&quot;, no country except the self-declared, unrecognized Chechen Republic of Ichkeria officially recognizes the act as a genocide.

During the repression period (1944–1957), deported nations were not allowed to change places without special permit taken from local authority. Names of repressed nations were totally erased from all books and encyclopedias. Chechen-language libraries were destroyed, many Chechen books and manuscripts were burned. Many families were divided and not allowed to travel to each other even if they found out where their relatives were.

===Chechnya after the deportation===
The Checheno-Ingush ASSR was transformed into Grozny Oblast, which also included the Kizlyar District and Naursky raion from Stavropol Kray, and parts of it were given to North Ossetia (part of Prigorodny District), Georgian SSR and Dagestan ASSR. Much of the empty housing was given to refugees from war-raged Western Soviet Union. Abandoned houses were settled by newcomers, only Jews and Meskhetian Turks refused to settle in foreign houses, both of which groups had previously lived in the area. In 1949 Soviet authorities erected a statue of 19th-century Russian general Aleksey Yermolov in Grozny. The inscription read, &quot;There is no people under the sun more vile and deceitful than this one.&quot;

Some of Chechen settlements were totally erased from maps and encyclopedia. This was how the aul of Khaibakh was rediscovered, through archaeological finds in Ukraine. Archaeologists have found the bodies of Caucasian scouts who died doing the job in the rear of the Nazi lines. In their pockets were found letters inscribing the name of the aul Khaibakh. When the scientists decided to inform the families of heroes that they have found their relatives, they learned that such settlement in Chechnya no longer exists. Continuing their investigation, they discovered the bitter truth about when soldiers from Chechnya died on the front, the relatives of theirs were burned alive in their homes by Soviet soldiers.

Many gravestones were destroyed (along with pretty much the whole library of Chechen medieval writing in Arabic and Georgian script about the land of Chechnya, its people, etc., leaving the modern Chechens and modern historians with a destroyed and no longer existent historical treasury of writings) in places that were renamed to be given Russian names. Tombstones of Chechens with a history of hundreds of years have been used by Soviets for the construction of pedestrian footpasses, foundations of houses, pig pens, etc. In 1991, Dzhokhar Dudayev made political capital by, in a symbolic move, sending out officials to gather these lost gravestones, many of which had lost their original inscriptions, and construct out of them a wall. This wall was made to symbolize both Chechen remorse for the past as well as the desire to, in the name of the dead ancestors, fashion the best possible Chechen Republic out of their land and work hard towards the future. It bears an engravement, reading: &quot;We will not break, we will not weep; we will never forget&quot;; tablets bore pictures of the sites of massacres, such as Khaibakh. It has now been moved by the Kadyrov government, sparking mass controversy.

===Recognition of the deportation as a genocide===
Forced deportation constitutes an act of genocide according to the IV Hague Convention of 1907 and the &quot;Convention on the prevention and repression of the crime of genocide&quot; of the UN General Assembly (adopted in 1948) and in this case this was acknowledged by the European Parliament as an act of genocide in 2004.

===The return===
In 1957, four years after Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953, the Soviet of Ministers passed a decree allowing repressed nations to freely travel in the Soviet Union. Many exiled Chechens took this opportunity to return to their ancestral land. This caused talk of a restoration of Chechen autonomy in the Northern Caucasus, the first secretary of the Grozny Oblast CPSU committee, Alexander Yakovlev, supported this idea, but pushed for a temporary autonomy in Kazakhstan, citing the insufficient resources in the province to house the re-patriated peoples (most of the former Chechen houses were settled by refugees from western USSR).

Chechens and Ingush had already been returning to their homeland in the tens of thousands for a couple of years before the announcement; after Khruschev&#x27;s denunciation of Stalin, the rate of return increased exponentially. By 1959, almost all Chechens and Ingush had returned.

In 1957, the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was officially restored by a decree directly from Moscow, but in previous 1936 borders. For example, South Ossetia kept the Prigorodny District, instead the republic was &quot;compensated&quot; with ethnic Russian territory on the left-bank Terek, Naursky district and Shelkovsky Districts. Shelkovsky (Moxne in Chechen) in fact had a Chechen heritage before the invasion of the Cossacks, and Naursky (called Hovran in Chechen) also had Chechens in its Eastern regions before the Russian invasion, though the bulk of Naursky may have been instead Kabardins. Nonetheless, the Russian populace (especially the Cossacks) had come, over the years, to view the lands as being theirs, as they had not been dominantly Chechen (or anything besides Cossack) for well over a century at the time of the return of the Chechens.

In the 20th century, several territories of Chechnya changed their owners several times. After the Russian Civil War, lands populated by Terek Cossacks and Russian colonists were granted to Chechens and Ingush as a reward for their support of the Bolsheviks against the White movement. However, these were not lands foreign to Chechens and Ingush. Namely, they were the Chechen lowlands and East Prigorodny (or &quot;West Ingushetia&quot;, depending on point of view). The Chechen river lowlands were an integral and indeed, necessary from an economic perspective, part of the historical Chechen nation&#x27;s land—to the point that even while Cossack settlers had forced the native inhabitants out, the clans retained nominal ownership per the Chechen clan system, which they regained de facto after the revolution. Likewise, with East Prigorodny, it had simply had been transferred to Ossete rule (during the Caucasian War as a reward for the Ossete&#x27;s treachery of their neighbors) but was still populated mainly by Ingush, though in some areas the Ossetes had indeed forced the original population out or otherwise eradicated it. The return of these two regions angered the Ossetes and the Cossacks, despite the fact that their &quot;ownership&quot; of the regions was disputed not only by the clan land-ownership system of the Vainakh populace, but also by the fact that they had only lived there for barely half a century, as opposed to the multiple millennia of Vainakh habitation of the two regions. Ossete presence in East Prigorodny dated back only to the 19th century, when Ossete expansion was encouraged (and aided) by the Russian state at the expense of the Ingush (see Ossetian-Ingush conflict). Even the North Ossetian capital of Vladikavkaz (in Prigorodny) was actually built on the site of the Ingush town of Zaur. Likewise, as noted on this page, Vainakh presence in the Terek region is ancient in origin (despite a mass of conflicts with Turkic settlers originating with the Mongol Invasions), compared to Cossack presence which could only date back a few centuries, and even greater compared to the recent arrival of urban Russians. Later these lands were partially returned to the Russians or Ossetians, triggering wrath among the Vainakh populace (which was, in any case, being submitted to Aardakh and mass massacre by Stalin at that point). In addition, the easternmost region of Chechenia, Akkia, the land of the Akki Chechens, was taken from Chechnya, and given to Dagestan. Just as had happened in East Prigorodny, the Chechens were sent to Siberia and Central Asia, and their homes were filled (literally) with Laks and Avars, with whom they still dispute the lands of Akkia.

===Ethnic tensions===
When the Chechens and Ingush returned to their homeland, they found other peoples living, quite literally, in their houses and on their land. Unsurprisingly, the returnees viewed the other ethnicities—Ossetes, Russians, Laks, Kumyks, and Avars—that had been moved onto the lands that had been theirs before with hostility. In the case of the conflict between Ossetes and Ingush in Prigorodny, and between the Russians/Cossacks and Chechens in northern Chechnya, the conflicts simmered and threatened to boil over into violence many times (and actually did more than once). In the case of Akkia, there was more understanding between the Chechens on one side and the Laks, Kumyks and Avars on the other, not because of their historical contacts and shared religion, but rather because the Chechens knew that the Dagestanis had not moved onto their land by choice, but rather were forced to. However, the conflict over Akkia to this day is not resolved, despite efforts by both sides to find a middle ground.

Many returning Chechens were settled in the lowland steppe regions, and in Grozny itself rather than the historical mountainous districts. The goal of this (and, indeed, adding Shelkovskaya and Naursky to Checheno-Ingushetia) was to try to forcefully assimilate the Chechens by keeping them away from the mountains and reminders of &quot;their ancient struggles&quot;, and to keep them mixed in with supposedly more loyal Russians so they could not rebel without a counter-force present. Ultimately, the attempt to make Checheno-Ingushetia more multi-ethnic in order to weaken the potential for national awakening and uprising failed, however, due to the Vainakh&#x27;s much higher birthrate. It did however succeed in deepening and renewing ethnic conflict between Chechens and Russians. The Russians, angered by issues over land ownership (they had come to view the lands they had settled as &quot;theirs&quot;) and job competition, rioted as early as 1958. In the 1958 Grozny riots, the Russians seized the central government buildings and demanded either a restoring of Grozny Oblast, or a creation of a non-titular autonomy, re-deportation of the Chechens and Ingush, establishment of &quot;Russian power&quot;, mass search and disarming of the Vainakh, before Soviet law-enforcement dispersed the rioters. On August 27, 1958, Major General Stepanov of the Military Aviation School issued an ultimatum to the local Soviet government that the Chechens must be sent back to Siberia and Central Asia or otherwise his Russians would &quot;tear (them) to pieces&quot;. Although the riot was dispersed and it was denounced as &quot;chauvinistic&quot;, afterward, the republican government made special efforts to please the Russian populace, and mass discrimination against the Chechens aimed at preserving the privileged position of the Russians commenced (see below).

Chechens were greatly disadvantaged in their homeland even after being allowed to return. There were no Chechen-language schools in their own homeland until 1990, leading to the crippling effect of lack of education of the populace (which did not universally understand Russian). According to sociologist Georgi Derluguian, the Checheno-Ingush Republic&#x27;s economy was divided into two spheres, much like French settler-ruled Algeria: the Russian sphere had all the jobs with higher salaries, and non-Russians were systematically kept out of all government positions. Russians (as well as Ukrainians and Armenians) worked in education, health, oil, machinery, and social services. Non-Russians (excluding Ukrainians and Armenians) worked in agriculture, construction, and a long host of undesirable jobs, as well as in the so-called &quot;informal sector&quot; (i.e., illegal, due to the mass discrimination in the legal sector). Due to rapid population growth among the non-Russians, combined with unfavorable economic conditions, the non-Russian population frequently engaged in the practice known in Russian as &quot;shabashka&quot;, the unofficial migration of republic minorities for economic reasons. This diaspora often later engaged in organized crime partly due to poverty and job discrimination, and the justification that they were only regaining the money that was stolen from them by the Russian elite in their homeland by its institutionalized discrimination. Derluguian (see citation above) describes this further as one of the main causes of the rebirth of the concept of Chechen nationalism in a much more unity-oriented form (that is, unity between Chechens, and Ingush if they want to be part of it).

==Perestroika and post-Soviet Chechnya==

===The Gorbachev era nationalist revival===
The experience (in addition to previous memories of conflicts with the Russian state) of the starvation in the 1930s, of Aardakh in 1944 and of the ethnic conflict with the Russian populace after the return from exodus had, according to Derluguian, Wood and others, allowed for the unification of loyalties. Bridges were made between taip, vird, and the like, and relationships were forged with prisonmates, partners in crime, among members of Chechen mafias in Russia, among members of labour teams, while the importance of taip and vird diminished due to the pressures of modernization. The Chechen narrative increasingly took the stance of a united Chechen struggle to escape once and for all the perceived oppression by the Russian state and to escape future hardships. In 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev came to power as the leader in the Soviet Union, and pursued a policy of openness and non-censorship of controversial issues. This allowed all of these issues to come to the forefront, as Chechen organizations became less and less reserved in their rhetoric and began saying what they had thought the whole time: that Chechens were persecuted time and time again, and continued to be, and that the Russian state was at fault. And the &quot;Question&quot; was asked: how can the Chechen people once and for all escape future persecution?

The answer to this &quot;Question&quot; came as independence in the perestroika period when the first Caucasian nationalist movement (in fact, predating all other formalized movements in all parts of the USSR except the Baltic states and Georgia), named Kavkaz was established in 1987. Explicitly Chechen national movements were established a year later, notably including the Vainakh Democratic Party (VDP, though its goal of a unified Vainakh state ended in 1993 with Ingushetia&#x27;s secession), and its trade union, named (of all things) &quot;Bart&quot; (unity in Chechen), established in 1989. The first target for Chechen historians to handle was the Russian-fabricated myth of Chechens and Ingush voluntarily joining Russia.

Much of the ideology came directly from the Baltic (especially Estonia), where Chechens observed with increasing admiration the success of nationalist revival movements. The spark for the forming of Kavkaz, however, was not nationalist, but rather environmentalist concerns: there were plans to build a nuclear power plant in the vicinity. Chechen culture had always revered nature, and political environmentalism blossomed in this period, but became a component of Chechen nationalism. Kavkaz soon became a nationalist movement with saving nature only as a side goal to be pursued once the Chechen nation had achieved an independent state.

===Prelude to the 1991 Revolution===
In 1989, for the very first time, a non-Russian, a Chechen, was appointed to be the ruler of Checheno-Ingushetia – Doku Zavgayev. While this was first embraced by Chechen nationalist movements, Zavgayev turned out to be extremely corrupt. The Chechen nationalist movements began to act against Zavgayev; in 1990, the highly nationalistic former Soviet aviator Dzhokhar Dudayev was elected head of the All-National Congress of the Chechen People which became the mouthpiece of the Chechen opposition.

There were also some signs from Moscow that the Chechens – as well as others – read as a green light. One of the most significant of these was on April 26, 1990, when the Supreme Soviet declared that the ASSRs within Russia get &quot;the full plenitude of state power&quot;, and put them on the same levels as Union Republics, which had the (at least nominal) right to secession. In August 1990, while campaigning for presidency of the RSFSR, Boris Yeltsin famously told ASSRs to &quot;take as much sovereignty as [they] could stomach&quot; back from Russia.

On November 25, 1990, the first Chechen National Congress declared the &quot;rightful sovereignty&quot; of the &quot;Chechen Republic of Noxçi-ço&quot;. Two days later, on November 27, the Supreme Soviet declared its agreement with this by declaring Checheno-Ingushetia&#x27;s sovereignty and adding that it would negotiate with Russia on equal footing, raising Chechnya to the level of Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia – that is, a Union Republic. At this point, the Chechen Communists had begun supporting &quot;full sovereignty at a minimum&quot;, meaning utterly every major party in Chechnya that included Chechens – the VDP, the Greens, the Communists, the Islamic Path Party, and the secularist Popular Front of Checheno-Ingushetia (modeled off that of Azerbaijan) – supported sovereignty, if not full independence.

The decisive move came on August 22, 1991, three days after the beginning of the August Coup. Government buildings were stormed by political groups representing the broad swathe of Chechen politics with the sole exception of Zavgayev: the Greens, the Islamists, the Nationalists, the Liberals, and even some of the Communists. One person died, a government official who jumped trying to escape or was pushed out of a window. Zavgayev was forced to resign.

===Dissolution of the Soviet Union and afterwards===
After the demise of the Soviet Union, the situation in Chechnya became unclear. Below is the chronology of that time:
* On September 2, 1991, the Russian installed Islamic board of the Caucasus, claiming that the executive committee was not legitimate and that actions of the committee would inevitably lead to bloodshed.
* On September 6, 1991, the building of the Supreme Soviet was occupied by Dzhokhar Dudayev&#x27;s guards, who removed the puppet Zavgayev.
* On September 15, 1991, a last session of the Supreme Soviet of the Chechen-Ingush Republic took place, and it decided to dissolve itself (under the request of Dudayev&#x27;s guards).
* On October 1, 1991, some of the ex-deputies decided to divide the republic into the Chechen Republic and the Ingush Republic. This move was eventually supported by a majority (90%) of Ingush voters, and Dudayev opted to allow the peaceful division of Checheno-Ingushetia into Chechnya and Ingushetia.
* On October 27, 1991, a referendum on independence was held, with a large majority (72%) of the populace voting and a majority approval (over 90% of voters, meaning at least about 64% of the populace approved independence). Khasbulatov contested the results, claiming that the elections were un-democratic (despite the fact that he organized them, apparently).
* On November 1, 1991, Dudayev issued a decree of Chechen independence (Указ об &quot;Об объявлении суверенитета Чеченской Республики с 1 ноября 1991 г.&quot;) The International Committee on Human Rights did not report any violations, though Dunlop stated that though there probably were some flaws in the election, he cites the observer, anthropologist Arutyunov (who stated that roughly 60-70% of the population of Chechnya supported independence at the time) it could nonetheless &quot;be regarded as an expression of Chechen popular will.&quot;
* On November 2, 1991, the 5th Assembly of People&#x27;s Deputies of RSFSR (the Russian parliament of that time) took place. A resolution was issued stating that the Chechen Supreme Soviet and President were not legitimate.

The independence years of 1991–94 for the &quot;Chechen Republic of Ichkeria&quot; were marked by growing tension with Russia, a declining economy (due both to a Russian economic blockade and due to Dudayev&#x27;s poor economic policies- described as such even by his own economic minister), and an increasingly unstable and divided internal political scene, with parts of the opposition being armed by Russia (see below) while the government in Grozny resorting to more and more drastic measures. The economic situation in Chechnya rapidly deteriorated and the civil order broker down.
After coming to the power in late 1991 Dudayev began the construction of an &quot;autocratic Chechen state.&quot; Dudayev&#x27;s government armed male Chechens in late 1991 and early 1992 which contributed to abuses against non-Chechens. Many Chechens who could not find work in Chechnya and lost their seasonal work in Russia turned against Russians and other non-Chechens who did not have the benefit of kin protection. The attacks included physical violence, robberies and &quot;routine humiliations.&quot; Some homes were directly seized from Russians, in other case they were forced to sell their apartments at gunpoint. Ethnic Russians were removed from the economic administration and the organs of judicial and legislative power. Many other leading representatives of the Russian-language population were murdered, including the university rector Kan-Kalik, dean Udodov, judge Samsonova, cabinet of ministers employee Sanko and journalist Krikoryants. From June 1990 to June 1991 20,000 Russians and other non-Chechens left Chechnya while in the next year 50,000 moved out. Overall, about one-third of Russians who lived in Chechnya were expelled in 1991–1992.

Dudayev was criticized by much of the Chechen political spectrum (particularly in urban Grozny) for his economic policies, a number of eccentric and embarrassing statements (such as insisting that &quot;Nokhchi&quot; meant descendant of Noah and that Russia was trying to destabilize the Caucasus with earthquakes), and his connections to former criminals (some of which, such as Beslan Gantemirov defected to the Russian side and served under Russian-backed regional governments). However, this opposition did not oppose Chechnya&#x27;s independence from Russia; it simply opposed Dudayev. In 1995 (during the war), one of the major opposition figures of the independence era, Khalid Delmayev, stated that he believed that Chechen statehood could be postponed, but could not be avoided.

The Russian federal government refused to recognize Chechen independence and made several attempts to take full control of the territory of the Chechen Republic. Russia actively funded the Chechen opposition to Dudayev&#x27;s government, but nonetheless, even members the opposition stated that there was no debate on whether Chechnya should be separate from Russia; there was one option: secession, as reported in 1992 by an observer for &quot;Moscow News&quot;. The federal government supported a failed coup designed to overthrow Dudayev in 1994.

The covert Russian attempts of overthrowing Dudayev by a means of an armed Chechen opposition forces resulted in repeated failed assaults on the city. Originally, Moscow had been backing the political opposition of Umar Avturkhanov &quot;peacefully&quot; (i.e. not arming them and encouraging them to wage an attempted coup). However, this changed in 1994 when Russia started arming and assisting the opposition. In August 1994 Avturkhanov attacked Grozny, but was repelled first by Chechen citizens who were then joined by Grozny government troops and Russian helicopters covered his retreat. On September 28, one of these helicopters was indeed shot down and its Russian pilot was held as a prisoner-of-war by the Chechen government. The last one on 26 November 1994 ended with capture of 21 Russian Army tank crew members, secretly hired as mercenaries by the FSK (former KGB, soon renamed FSB); their capture was sometimes cited as one of the reasons of Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s decision to launch the open intervention. In the meantime, Grozny airport and other targets were bombed by unmarked Russian aircraft. Russia then decided to invade Chechnya to reestablish control by the federal government in Moscow.

==First Chechen War (1994–1996)==

Russian federal forces overran Grozny in November 1994. Although the forces achieved some initial successes, the federal military made a number of critical strategic blunders during the Chechnya campaign and was widely perceived as incompetent. Led by Aslan Maskhadov, separatists conducted successful guerrilla operations from the forested and mountainous terrain. By March 1995, Aslan Maskhadov became leader of the Chechen resistance.

Russia first appointed in early 1995 a government with Khadzhiyev as ruler and Avturkhanov as deputy. Gantemirov was also restored to his position as mayor of Grozny. However, later in the fall of that year, Khadzhiyev was replaced with Doku Zavgayev, the former head of the republic who had fled after the Dudayev-led revolution in 1990–1991. He was extremely unpopular not only among the Chechens, but also among even the Russian diaspora, who nicknamed him &quot;Doku Aeroportovich&quot; because he rarely ever left the Russian-run airbase in Khankala. By statistics given by the Russian government itself&#x27;s Audit Committee, he was allocated 12.3 trillion rubles in the first two months alone in a republic now impoverished by war and bloodshed.

Although at first, the Russians had the upper hand despite determined homegrown Chechen civilian resistance, halfway through the war, the separatist Chechen government released a statement calling for help. They received it both from the Islamic world (with numbers of Arabs streaming in), but more prominently from former Soviet states and satellites, with Baltic peoples, Estonians, Romanians, Azeris, Dagestanis, Circassians, Abkhaz, Georgians, Poles, Ukrainians, Belarusians, Hungarians, and even a few Russians streaming in to aid the so-called &quot;cause of freedom&quot; that the Chechen government professed. Diaspora Chechens also returned, as parallel to the First Nagorno-Karabakh War, to aid their &quot;daymokhk&quot; (fatherland). With the new troops also came new weaponry, and from this point forward, the tables were turned, with the Russian army becoming more and more mutinous and lacking of morale, while the anti-Russian side was growing stronger and more confident (see also: First Chechen War, on this phenomenon).
In June 1995, Chechen guerrillas occupied a hospital in the southern Russian town of Budyonnovsk (in Stavropol Krai), taking over 1,000 hostages. Federal forces attempted to storm the hospital twice and failed; the guerrillas were allowed to leave after freeing their hostages. This incident, televised accounts of war crimes and mass destruction, and the resulting widespread demoralization of the federal army, led to a federal withdrawal and the beginning of negotiations on March 21, 1996.

Separatist President Dudayev was killed in a Russian rocket attack on April 21, 1996, and the Vice-president Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev became president. Negotiations on Chechen independence were repeatedly finally tabled in August 1996, leading to the end of the war and withdrawal of federal forces.

In the later stages of the First Chechen War, a large exodus of non-Vainakhs occurred. In the case of the originally 200,000 strong Russian minority, this is usually cited as a result of growing anti-ethnic-Russian sentiment among the Vainakh populace, which had been suppressed during the rule of Dudayev, who in some cases supported Russia.

===Interwar period: 1996–1999===
In 1997, Aslan Maskhadov comfortably won the election, campaigning as a moderate who would unite the various factions within Chechen society, but establish Chechnya as an independent and secular state, aligning itself with the West more than with the Middle East, as well as keeping Ichkeria safe from another armed conflict with Russia by maintaining relatively positive relations. Yandarbiyev&#x27;s platform was an explicitly Islamic state with some implementation of sharia law, and a largely Islamophilic foreign policy. Basayev, finally, insisted on focusing less on gaining foreign support and recognition and more on rebuilding Ichkeria&#x27;s own military. Basayev, despite criticizing Yandarbiyev&#x27;s policy towards radical Islamic groups, stated that attacks on Russian territory outside Chechnya should be executed if it is necessary to remind Russia that Ichkeria was not a pushover. At the point of 1997, as evidenced from the election, Maskhadov&#x27;s policy of relative moderation and looking West for help was most popular, though he gained considerable following because of his status as a war hero. The results of the election were a 79.4% turnout, with 59.3% voting for Maskhadov, 23.5% voting for Basayev and 10.1% voting for Yandarbiyev.

Aslan Maskhadov became president in 1997, but was unable to consolidate control as the wartorn republic devolved into regional bickering among local teip leaders and factions. One major source of his unpopularity was the perception of him being &quot;weak&quot; in dealing with Russia, which was exploited by the more militaristic opposition.

Maskhadov sought to maintain Chechen sovereignty while pressing Moscow to help rebuild the republic, whose formal economy and infrastructure were virtually destroyed. Russia continued to send money for the rehabilitation of the republic; it also provided pensions and funds for schools and hospitals. However, much of this did not arrive, its disappearance being attributed to embezzlement by either Russian or Chechen officials/warlords (or both). Nearly half a million people (40% of Chechnya&#x27;s prewar population) had been internally displaced and lived in refugee camps or overcrowded villages. The economy was destroyed. Two Russian brigades were stationed in Chechnya and did not leave.

Chechnya had been badly damaged by the war and the economy was in shambles. Aslan Maskhadov tried to concentrate power in his hands to establish authority, but had trouble creating an effective state or a functioning economy. He attempted to attract foreign investment in Chechnya&#x27;s oil industry and reconstruction of Grozny.

The war ravages and lack of economic opportunities left numbers of armed former guerrillas with no occupation but further violence. Kidnappings, robberies, and killings of fellow Chechens and outsiders, most notably the killings of four employees of British Granger Telecom in 1998, weakened the possibilities of outside investment and Maskhadov&#x27;s efforts to gain international recognition of its independence effort. Kidnappings became common in Chechnya, procuring over $200 million during the three-year independence of the chaotic fledgling state, but victims were rarely killed. In 1998, 176 people had been kidnapped, and 90 of them had been released during the same year according to official accounts. There were several public executions of criminals. Caving to intense pressure from his Islamist foes in his desire to find a national consensus, Maskhadov allowed the proclamation of the Islamic Republic of Ichkeria in 1998 and the Sharia system of justice was introduced.

President Maskhadov started a major campaign against hostage-takers, and on October 25, 1998, Shadid Bargishev, Chechnya&#x27;s top anti-kidnapping official, was killed in a remote controlled car bombing. Bargishev&#x27;s colleagues then insisted they would not be intimidated by the attack and would go ahead with their offensive. Other anti-kidnapping officials blamed the attack on Bargishev&#x27;s recent success in securing the release of several hostages, including 24 Russian soldiers and an English couple. Maskhadov blamed the rash of abductions in Chechnya on unidentified &quot;outside forces&quot; and their Chechen henchmen, allegedly those who joined Pro-Moscow forces during the second war.

Some of the kidnapped (most of whom were non-Chechens) were sold into indentured servitude to Chechen families. They were openly called slaves and had to endure starvation, beating, and often maiming.

The years of independence had some political violence as well. On December 10, Mansur Tagirov, Chechnya&#x27;s top prosecutor, disappeared while returning to Grozny. On June 21, the Chechen security chief and a guerrilla commander fatally shot each other in an argument. The internal violence in Chechnya peaked on July 16, 1998, when fighting broke out between Maskhadov&#x27;s National Guard force led by Sulim Yamadayev (who joined pro-Moscow forces in the second war) and militants in the town of Gudermes; over 50 people were reported killed and the state of emergency was declared in Chechnya.

Maskhadov proved unable to guarantee the security of the oil pipeline running across Chechnya from the Caspian Sea, and illegal oil tapping and acts of sabotage deprived his regime of crucial revenues and agitated Moscow. In 1998 and 1999 Maskhadov survived several assassination attempts, blamed on the Russian intelligence services.

==Second Chechen War and its consequences==
In August 1999, renegade Chechen and Arab commanders led a large group of militants into Dagestan. Headed by Shamil Basayev and Amir Khattab (who were opposed vehemently by the government in Grozny, from which they had broken off allegiance), the insurgents fought Russian forces in Dagestan for a week before being driven back into Chechnya proper. On September 9, 1999, Chechens were blamed for the bombing of an apartment complex in Moscow and several other explosions in Russia.

These events were viewed by Russia&#x27;s new prime minister Vladimir Putin as a violation of the Khasav-Yurt Accord by the Chechen side. Thus, on October 1, 1999, Russian troops entered Chechnya. However, according to then-interior minister Sergei Stepashin, the invasion of Chechnya would have occurred even if these events had not occurred:

Much better trained and prepared than in the first war, by December all of the northern steppe regions were conquered, and Grozny was encircled, which finally surrendered in early February 2000. By late spring, all of the lowland, and most of the mountainous territory was successfully re-claimed by the federal forces.

After several years of military administration, in 2002, a local government was formed by Russian-allied Chechens headed by Akhmad Kadyrov. In 2003, referendum on constitution and presidential election were held. However, it was widely criticized, and in some cases, the vote recorded was not only vastly more than the actual population living there, but the majority of &quot;voters&quot; were Russian soldiers and dead Chechens (who of course were &quot;loyal&quot; pro-Russians, according to the results).

The Chechen separatists initially resisted fiercely, and several high-profile battles resulted in their victories such as the Battle of Hill 776 and Zhani-Vedeno ambush. Nonetheless, the success in establishing a Russian-allied Chechen militia and the actions of Russian Special Forces meant that in 2002 Putin announced that the war was officially over.

However, the Insurgency continued, and has spread to neighbouring regions with high-profile clashes such as the Battle of Nalchik and the Beslan School siege. After Beslan, there was a 4-5-year drought of major attacks by Chechens outside of Chechnya. According to some, this was due to an element of embarrassment and guilt on the part of the Chechen rebels over the deaths of children in Beslan.

The September 11 attacks on the United States caused a disaster for the Chechens, as much of the West went from passive sympathy to hostility as Russia was able to brand Chechen separatism as Islamist. As Amjad Jaimoukha puts it,

The al-Qaeda attacks on the US on 11 September 2001 resulted in a major setback to the Chechen cause and robbed the Chechens of the small modicum of sympathy they had had in the West. Russia played its cards right and quickly associated Chechen legitimate struggle for independence with Muslim extremism.

The raid on Beslan had, in fact, more to do with the Ingush involved than the Chechens, but was highly symbolic for both. The Ossetes and Ingush had (and have) a conflict over ownership of the Prigorodny District, which hit high points during the 1944 genocide, and the ethnic cleansing of Ingush by Ossetes (the Ossetes getting assistance from the Russian military) in 1992–3. At the time of the raid, there were still over 40,000 Ingush refugees in tent camps in Ingushetia and Chechnya. The Beslan school itself had been used against the Ingush- in 1992 the gym was used as a pen to round up Ingush for expulsion and/or massacre by the Ossetes. For the Chechens, the motive was revenge for the destruction of their homes and, indeed families: Beslan was the site from which missiles were launched at Chechnya. A large fraction (overwhelming majority) of the people involved in the hostage taking raid also direct victims of Russian abuse, including many who were victimized as children and/or, in the case of Khaula Nazirov, had their children ironically murdered by Russian troops during a raid of a school.

Once, however, it was broadcast that there were large amounts of children killed by a group that included Chechens, the Chechens were struck with a large amount of shame. One spokesman for the Chechen cause stated that &quot;Such a bigger blow could not be dealt upon us... People around the world will think that Chechens are monsters if they could attack children&quot;. He went on to state that the Russians had killed far more children, including in schools during their war in Chechnya, and that this had been deliberately ignored by the rest of the world. Nonetheless, largely for this reason, attacks ceased until 2008.

Both the federal and separatist armies have been widely criticized by human rights groups such as Amnesty International for alleged war crimes committed during the two Chechen wars, including accusations on both sides of rape, torture, looting, and the murder of civilians. The Russian military has been repeatedly reported to have used vacuum bombs and bombed white-flag bearing civilian vessels (see the Katyr-Yurt Massacre) by international charity groups. Dozens of mass graves (created by the Russian side) containing hundreds of corpses have been uncovered since the beginning of the Chechen wars in 1994. As of June 2008, there were 57 registered locations of mass graves in Chechnya. According to Amnesty International, thousands may be buried in unmarked graves including up to 5,000 civilians who disappeared since the beginning of the Second Chechen War in 1999. In 2008, the largest mass grave found to date was uncovered in Grozny, containing some 800 bodies from the First Chechen War in 1995. Russia&#x27;s general policy to the Chechen mass graves is to not exhume them.

The two wars have left millions of people living in poverty, up to half a million refugees, and most of the infrastructure destroyed. Kadyrov claims that since then Northern Chechnya and Grozny have been rebuilt. These claims have been refuted by most other sources (such as Tony Wood), who note that most of the revenue has gone to the construction of Kadyrov&#x27;s private mansion for his clan and his expensive birthday celebration.

<text>Frederick Paul Ott (1860 in New Jersey – October 24, 1936 in West Orange, New Jersey), skilled machinist, was a key employee of Thomas Edison&#x27;s laboratories from the 1870s until Edison&#x27;s death in 1931. His likeness appears in two of the earliest surviving motion pictures – the well-known &quot;Edison Kinetoscopic Record of a Sneeze&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Fred Ott&#x27;s Sneeze&quot;) and the little-seen &quot;Fred Ott Holding a Bird&quot; – both from 1894.

The former became an icon of cinema itself. Shot in medium close-up, the film shows Ott seemingly taking a pinch of snuff causing him to sneeze. Comic in format, &quot;The Sneeze,&quot; as it also came to be known, was made in early January 1894 at the request of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; magazine, which requested illustrations for an article about the Kinetoscope.

Ott began working with Edison in 1874 (at age 14) and became one of the inventor&#x27;s most valued employees and closest friends. Alongside his brother John F. Ott, he worked with Edison on many inventions, retiring shortly after the nearly-simultaneous deaths of Edison and John Ott in 1931. Ott died at his home in West Orange, New Jersey, on October 24, 1936.

<text>Knottingley is a town in the City of Wakefield in West Yorkshire, England on the River Aire and the old A1 road before it was bypassed as the A1(M). Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, it has a population of 13,503, increasing to 13,710 for the City of Wakefield ward at the 2011 Census. It makes up the majority of the Knottingley ward represented on Wakefield Council.

Until 1699, it was an important inland river port but, in that year, the Aire was made navigable as far as Leeds, which soon surpassed it. Knottingley continued as a centre for boat building into the 20th century. In the late 19th century, it started glass manufacturing. The town is served by Knottingley railway station.

After 1870, the town became known for glass manufacturing. In 1887, Bagley&#x27;s Glassworks purchased the rights to the first bottle-making machine, invented by a Ferrybridge postmaster. There is a Bagley&#x27;s Glass gallery in Pontefract Museum.

Close to Knottingley is Ferrybridge Power Station, which had the largest cooling towers of their kind in Europe. Three of these towers collapsed in high winds in 1965. The remaining towers, which could be seen for miles around, were demolished between 2019 and 2022.

The town was the last in the United Kingdom to have a working deep coal mine, Kellingley Colliery, until it closed in December 2015.

==History==

Knottingley means &quot;the clearing of Cnotta&#x27;s people&quot;, from the Old English personal name &quot;Cnotta&quot; meaning &quot;knot&quot;, describing a small, round man and -&quot;ingas&quot; &quot;people of&quot; + &quot;leāh&quot; &quot;wood, modern , not the same meaning as Leah (personal name)&quot;. The name was recorded as &quot;Cnotinesleahemm&quot; in 1128.

During the three Sieges of Pontefract Castle, Oliver Cromwell took residence in the town of Knottingley, believed to be in Wildbore House. The house was later demolished when its land was mined as a quarry for the limestone underneath.

Knottingley, inextricably linked with Ferrybridge, is a West Yorkshire town whose history is tied to river travel and industry. It has managed to retain certain elements of that industrial history as thriving enterprises today, providing employment for many of its combined population of some 17,000. It was originally an Anglo-Saxon settlement, though the ancient monument of Ferrybridge Henge shows it had significant indigenous habitation long before then.

The crossing over the Aire at Ferrybridge was of importance for many centuries. A bridge was built there in 1198, and another to replace it two centuries later. Located on the Great North Road linking London with York and Edinburgh beyond that, the town became an important staging place for the coach traffic on that route.

Knottingley was an inland port of some note, long the last navigable point on the Aire until the Aire and Calder Navigation, built in 1704 and widened in 1826, enabled barges to make it to Leeds. Its shipyards built and maintained both inland and seagoing vessels. Pottery was a significant industry for the town from the 19th century until as late as the 1940s, when the Australian Pottery, opened to cater to that country&#x27;s needs, finally closed.

Glass manufacturing continues to be important. The town had Kellingley Colliery operating until December 2015. The demand for coal was helped by the huge power station at Ferrybridge. Whilst most of the coal bound for Ferrybridge left by rail, some was transported up river using barges, the last of which was delivered in December 2002. The last miners, their families and many former miners marched from Knottingley Town Hall to the Social Club in December 2015.

==Sport==
A short lived greyhound racing track existed from 1940 to 1946 and again during 1947. The racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club) and was known as a flapping track, which was the nickname given to independent tracks. The venue could accommodate up to 3,000 people.

The town is home to a rugby union club, who meet on Marsh Lane.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Yorkshire and ITV Yorkshire. Television signals are received from the Emley Moor TV transmitter. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Leeds on 92.4 FM, Greatest Hits Radio Yorkshire (formerly Radio Aire and Ridings FM) on 96.3 and 106.8 FM, Hits Radio West Yorkshire on 102.5 FM, Heart Yorkshire on 106.2 FM, Capital Yorkshire on 105.1 and 105.8 FM and 5 Towns FM, a community radio station that broadcasts from Castleford. The town is served by the local newspapers, &quot;Wakefield Express&quot; and the &quot;Pontefract and Castleford Express&quot;.

==Education==
Knottingley has one high school, De Lacy Academy formerly called Knottingley High School and Sports College.

It has several primary schools: England Lane Academy, Willow Green Academy, Knottingley St Botolph&#x27;s C of E Academy, The Vale Primary Academy and Simpson&#x27;s Lane Academy.
Sixth-form colleges are located in nearby Pontefract, Wakefield and Selby.

<text>USS &quot;Halibut&quot; (SS-232), a submarine, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the halibut, a large species of flatfish.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Halibut&quot;′s keel was laid down by the Portsmouth Navy Yard at Kittery, Maine on 16 May 1941. She was launched on 3 December 1941, sponsored by Mrs. P. T. Blackburn, and commissioned on 10 April 1942 with Commander Philip H. Ross in command.

==War patrols==

===First and second patrols===
&quot;Halibut&quot; completed her outfitting and shakedown cruise 23 June 1942 and departed for the Pacific, arriving Pearl Harbor on 27 June. She departed Hawaii 9 August for the Aleutian Islands area for her first patrol. After searching Chichagof Harbor and the waters off Kiska Island, the submarine engaged in an indecisive gunnery duel with a freighter on 23 August. Finding few targets, she terminated her patrol at Dutch Harbor on 23 September.

Her second patrol was also off the Aleutians. She departed Dutch Harbor on 2 October 1942 and surfaced for a torpedo attack on what appeared to be a large freighter on 11 October. The ship, a decoy (Q-ship) equipped with concealed guns and torpedo tubes, attacked &quot;Halibut&quot; with high-explosive shells and a torpedo as the submarine took radical evasive action to escape the trap. After eluding her assailant she returned to Dutch Harbor on 23 October and Pearl Harbor on 31 October 1942.

===Third and fourth patrols===
&quot;Halibut&quot; departed Pearl Harbor 22 November 1942 for her third war patrol, off the northeast coast of Japan. She began stalking a convoy the night of 9 December and early the next morning closed for the attack. A hit amidships damaged the Japanese troop transport &quot;Uyo Maru&quot; (6,376 tons); &quot;Halibut&quot; put two torpedoes squarely into the cargo ship &quot;Gyokusan Maru&quot; (1,970 tons), sinking her on 12 December. On 16 December &quot;Halibut&quot; made two more attacks sinking the cargo ship &quot;Shingo Maru&quot; (4,740 tons) and running the cargo ship &quot;Genzan Maru&quot; (5,708 tons) aground, wrecking her and forcing her abandonment. Each ship was fully laden with war materials destined for Japan. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 15 January 1943.

The submarine sailed from Pearl Harbor again on 8 February 1943 on her fourth war patrol. Heading for the Japan-Kwajalein shipping lanes, she tracked a freighter the morning of 20 February and closed to sink troop transport &quot;Shinkoku Maru&quot; (3,991 tons) that night. While northeast of Truk on 3 March, she detected the naval auxiliary &quot;Nichiyu Maru&quot; (6,818 tons) and attacked, but was driven off by the fire of deck guns. (&quot;Nichiyu Maru&quot; reached Apra harbor under tow, but was deemed beyond repair and was consequently broken up.) &quot;Halibut&quot; terminated this patrol in Pearl Harbor 30 March.

===Fifth patrol===
&quot;Halibut&quot; began her fifth war patrol 10 June and made for the waters around Truk. She made her first attack 23 June. No hits were scored and the submarine was forced to wait out a severe depth charge attack. Halibut detected, tracked, and attacked a convoy bound for Truk from Kisarazu, Japan, putting a single torpedo (out of a spread of six) into the side of IJN troop transport &quot;Aikoku Maru&quot; (10,437 tons). &quot;Aikoku Maru&quot; was transporting ground personnel and equipment of the 201st NAG and suffered among its casualties 21 men. &quot;Halibut&quot; also attacked the escort carrier on 10 July while escorting the same convoy, and finally returned to Midway Island on 28 July 1943. No tonnage credit was given in the contemporaneous record or the postwar JANAC accounting, however. (Credit for the damage to the carrier was awarded to attacking later that same day.)

===Sixth patrol===
Ignatius J. &quot;Pete&quot; Galantin assumed command 11 August, and &quot;Halibut&quot; set out on her sixth patrol on 20 August. Together with and , she cruised towards her assigned patrol zone off the east coasts of Honshū and Hokkaido, including the Tsugaru Strait. On 29 August, she sighted a freighter with a &quot;Shigure&quot;-class escort; two torpedo attacks on the destroyer failed and &quot;Halibut&quot; was forced deep for eight hours to avoid the 43 depth charges expended by the destroyer and a second vessel. The attackers lost contact with &quot;Halibut&quot; in the early evening, allowing her to move away and resurface. The following day the sub headed into Iburi Wan; she sighted one convoy but was unable to close, but later sank the 6,581-ton freighter &quot;Taibun Maru&quot;, with three bow shots. Two small patrol boats saw the sinking and dropped 24 depth charges after &quot;Halibut&quot;, which escaped by unintentionally passing through a minefield.

After some days of poor weather, &quot;Halibut&quot; entered the approaches to the Tsugaru Strait. Firing on a freighter found by radar in foggy conditions, she expended six torpedoes with no results. Returning to the coast between Erimo Saki and Muroran, she closed on a radar contact around dawn on 6 September. The contact, the heavily loaded freighter &quot;Shogen Maru&quot; (3,362 tons), was sighted and sunk with four torpedoes. That night &quot;Halibut&quot; made radar contact with a vessel identified as a destroyer but later found to be the light cruiser , firing the submarine&#x27;s remaining aft torpedoes in a rough sea for no hits. (One torpedo actually hit but was a dud.) With only one torpedo remaining, she began her return trip to Midway on 7 September after eleven days in enemy waters. That night she traced radio transmissions to a small sampan she sank with her deck guns. &quot;Halibut&quot; stopped briefly at Midway for fuel and food before sailing to a full refit at Pearl Harbor, arriving on 16 September.

During her time refitting, &quot;Halibut&quot; was used for torpedo testing, firing torpedoes from her stern tubes into the cliffs at Kahoolawe – stern firing was a precaution against erratic or circular running torpedoes. Earlier tests had shown that one in three Mark 14 torpedoes failed to explode on impact; the crushing deformed the contact exploder before it could detonate the firing caps. The modified versions, made from Japanese aircraft propellers, that were tested by &quot;Halibut&quot; were almost three times better in testing (6 out of 7 detonations) and even more efficient in action. A short time later, while performing underwater training, &quot;Halibut&quot; was accidentally struck by a destroyer; the glancing blow damaged both periscopes (an incident which in peacetime would warrant a board of inquiry). The damage was repaired in hours, and there were no other repercussions.

===Seventh patrol===
&quot;Halibut&quot; sailed from Pearl Harbor on her seventh war patrol on 10 October 1943, headed for the approaches to the Bungo Suido. She reached Midway after four days travel and stopped briefly to top up her fuel tanks (having consumed 14,000 gallons already) and to repair a defective motor-generator for her new SJ radar. She reached Okinoshima on 25 October and quickly found her daylight activities constrained by a heavy fishing sampan presence. Over the early morning of 29 October she detected, tracked, and closed on a freighter and small anti-submarine warfare escort. &quot;Halibut&quot; was detected and the escort drove her off and held her at bay with fifteen depth charge attacks as the freighter fled. Resurfacing, a lookout noticed the smoke of a distant convoy. The submarine closed as the daylight faded, coming close enough to submerge for periscope observation on the morning of 1 November. The convoy consisted of seven freighters and three -type torpedo boats as escorts. &quot;Halibut&quot; launched three torpedoes from at 06:52 and made no hits; the freighters turned away and two torpedo boats closed but were ineffective in locating the submarine. Around midday, &quot;Halibut&quot; headed south after the convoy, surfacing as night fell. She was detecting curious &#x27;friendly&#x27; radar interference as, unknown to her, and were also chasing the convoy (sinking two ships each from the convoy as &quot;Halibut&quot; closed).

On the morning of 2 November &quot;Halibut&quot; caught up with two straggling freighters from the convoy. She launched three torpedoes at (4,653 tons) at 28-18N, 134-48E. Two torpedoes hit, but the sinking vessel bravely turned towards the submarine, forcing her to evade and lose range on the second freighter. (She would later sink taking her entire crew of 84 souls with her.) &quot;Halibut&quot; launched three torpedoes at long range but made no hits. She surfaced to increase her speed, but the freighter revealed she was armed with some accurate firing, forcing &quot;Halibut&quot; back under. The submarine shadowed the freighter and positioned herself for an attack using her stern tubes, firing six torpedoes in rough seas for no hits.

She went on to patrol the approaches to Van Diemen Strait just south of Kagoshima, before returning north when she received an Ultra message indicating a Japanese task force, including an aircraft carrier, near the Bungo Suido. A high-speed race put &quot;Halibut&quot; into position on the morning of 5 November, and she fired six torpedoes at the carrier (identified at the time as so as to conceal the source of the information; later properly identified as ). A single torpedo hit near the ship&#x27;s rudders, leaving the carrier unable to manoeuvre. When &quot;Halibut&quot; tried to fire her single remaining stern torpedo, it activated but failed to leave the tube. &quot;Halibut&quot; dove to more than to avoid attacks from three destroyer escorts; in the event, only thirteen depth charges were dropped. The submarine resurfaced after dark and set course for home, running seven days to Midway and then reaching Pearl Harbor on 17 November after thirty-eight days on patrol, a round trip of , of which only were actually &#x27;on station&#x27;.

===Eighth patrol===
On her eighth war patrol (beginning at Pearl Harbor on 14 December) &quot;Halibut&quot; formed a coordinated attack group, or &quot;wolf pack&quot;, with and . All three commanders were intensively trained for the patrol at &#x27;Convoy College&#x27; at Pearl Harbor. The very first USN wolf pack had left Midway on 1 October 1943 – , , and claimed five ships sunk and eight damaged (post-war analysis indicated only three sinkings). &quot;Halibut&quot; was part of the third wolf pack.

The group&#x27;s journey to the patrol area around the Mariana Islands was marked by very rough seas and gale force winds. On 26 December &quot;Halibut&quot; was attacked by an aircraft; three bombs were dropped but the submarine took no damage. The group reached its target area on 29 December, but over the following weeks made only fleeting, poor contacts with enemy vessels, including a missed contact with the battleship on 11 January (the battleship detected the search radars of the submarines and completely outmaneuvered them as daylight ended). A few days later they failed to sink an and were subjected to twenty-two depth charges. On 17 January &quot;Halibut&quot; broke from the wolf pack to return to Midway as her fuel reserves were depleted (both the other vessels were using their #4 ballast tank to store fuel and had begun the patrol with an extra 24,000 gallons).

Operating independently, &quot;Halibut&quot; patrolled Port Apra and Tanapag Harbor on her way home, observing a &quot;Katori&quot;-class cruiser near Saipan, and being attacked by aircraft and depth charges on 23 January while attempting a stealthy approach on the &quot;Unyō&quot; in Garapan Anchorage (the carrier had already been damaged by &quot;Haddock&quot;). &quot;Halibut&quot; was forced down to to avoid her attackers, and spent over thirteen hours submerged. She reached Midway on 1 February 1944 where she suffered storm damage to her ballast tanks while moored.

===Ninth patrol===
&quot;Halibut&quot; departed on her ninth war patrol 21 March 1944, her patrol area was off Okinawa, a by island-filled area called Nansei Shoto. Cruising between Amami O Shima and Tokuno Shima late on 12 April, the submarine encountered several enemy vessels outbound from Kagoshima, Kyushu for Naha, Okinawa; following them northwards, she spotted a south-bound freighter with three small escorts. She launched three torpedoes; one struck &quot;Taichu Maru&quot; (3,213 tons) squarely amidships and she quickly sank. The three escorts dropped eighteen depth charges, which did little more than test the newly fitted depth charge indicator. The sinking alerted the Japanese, and both sea and air anti-submarine patrols were intensified in the area, preventing &quot;Halibut&quot; from operating successfully for the next two weeks even as she expanded her patrol into the East China Sea.

Finally, on 26 April, the submarine found some action. She passed between Iheya Retto and Okinawa Jima in the very early morning of 26 April and detected three freighters with escorts. She closed the range over several hours and fired six torpedoes from , three each at two freighters. Two hit and the convoy was scattered. &quot;Halibut&quot; eluded the escorts and returned to the attack around dawn. Closing in on a ship separated from the group, she sank &quot;Genbu Maru&quot; with two torpedoes. Very soon afterwards she detected a small vessel using sonar and fired from to sink the coastal minelayer &quot;Kanome&quot;. The submarine was then forced into evasive action as a bomber arrived overhead; the aircraft and two patrol boats dropped some ninety depth charges without ever endangering &quot;Halibut&quot;. Later, off the northeastern shore of Kume Shima on 29 April, she fired fifty shells from her 4-inch deck gun at two warehouses and other buildings.

On 1 May she spotted a compact group of eighteen 250-ton sampans while east of Okinawa and trailed them southwards; after dusk she surfaced and closed the range to attack with her deck armaments from . Two sampans exploded violently but return fire and flying debris injured three of &quot;Halibut&quot;″s crew – one seriously. With concerns for the injured man, the sub left her patrol zone a day early to return to Midway. She rendezvoused with after six days travel, and a fully qualified doctor from Midway aboard the second sub was transferred to &quot;Halibut&quot; by boat.

When &quot;Halibut&quot; reached Midway on 11 May, it was decided to leave the injured man aboard and carry on to Pearl Harbor, which she reached on 15 May 1944. Again it was decided to leave the injured man aboard rather than risk moving him, and the submarine was refueled and restored before heading on to a major overhaul at the ship repair basin of Bethlehem Steel at Sixteenth Street in south San Francisco, California, with ninety days rest for the crew. She reached that port on 24 May and finally, after twenty-one days in his bunk, the injured man was transferred to a land hospital – Oak Knoll Naval Hospital. During her major overhaul, &quot;Halibut&quot; had some small changes. An automatic plotting table was added; the main electric power control cubicle was given shock-mountings; there was a new, more powerful, trim pump; another passive sonar set; and the 20 mm deck gun was replaced with a 40 mm rapid-fire gun. After testing, the submarine returned to Pearl Harbor on 20 September 1944, where Galantin received a promotion to commander.

===Tenth patrol===
On her tenth war patrol &quot;Halibut&quot; again joined a coordinated attack group, this time with &quot;Haddock&quot; and , under the overall command of John P. Roach. &quot;Halibut&quot; was given a loadout of the newer all-electric Mark 18 torpedo. The group departed Pearl on 8 October, bypassing Midway and taking a great circle route towards Tanapag, Saipan, which had been captured in June. The group replenished their stores there and after two days departed on 21 October to head for the patrol zone around the strait between Formosa and Luzon.

The group reached the Luzon Strait on 25 October, but mid-morning the submarines were ordered to set up scouting lines to intercept units of the Japanese fleet retiring after the Battle off Cape Engaño. Spread out east-west apart, the submarines moved rapidly until enemy ships (heavily engaged by USN dive bombers) were detected around 17:30. &quot;Halibut&quot; and the other subs had encountered the remnants of Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa&#x27;s force. She submerged at 17:45 while some away from a vessel she identified as the battleship (later found to be ). At 18:43 she fired six torpedoes from . While the torpedoes were &quot;en route&quot;, a maneuver by the Japanese vessels brought an escort into their path and a destroyer was sunk. JANAC later identified the sunken vessel as , but Galantin states that it was more likely , as Japanese records list the &quot;Akizuki&quot; being sunk by aerial attack earlier in the day. Even &quot;Hatsuzuki&quot; is unlikely, usually credited as having been sunk by a US cruiser-destroyer group. An hour after the attack, &quot;Halibut&quot; resurfaced and headed north chasing a radar contact, which she lost in the early morning of 26 October.

The submarine returned to the Luzon Strait, where she found the variable currents in the two main channels (Bashi Channel and Balintang Channel) made keeping trim very tricky. On 28 October she was attacked with no effect (beyond a little fright for her lookouts) by an anti-submarine aircraft. For the next two weeks, in constantly poor weather, &quot;Halibut&quot; found no enemy shipping except the hospital ship &quot;Hikawa Maru&quot;, which could not be attacked.

On 13 November &quot;Halibut&quot; noticed increasing air anti-submarine activity. In the early morning of 14 November she entered the Bashi Channel and around noon she detected a northbound convoy of four freighters with escorts. The submarine launched four torpedoes from . As &quot;Halibut&quot; submerged and turned away, the crew heard a &quot;loud, fast buzzing noise&quot; which was quickly followed by five explosions (apparently &quot;jikitanchiki&quot;-equipped Mitsubishi G3M aircraft). The submarine went down to as she detected the sonar of two escorts when a sudden near explosion severely damaged the conning tower, which had been abandoned. The escort was &quot;CD-6&quot;, which was alerted by the aircraft of the sub&#x27;s location. This blast was followed by another series of very close explosions which damaged equipment in the control room and yet another series of blasts over the forward battery compartment that damaged the torpedo room, forward battery room, and the main air bank, &quot;one of the most devastating [attacks] of the war&quot;. The attacks drove &quot;Halibut&quot; down to ; as air pressure rose to the crew were forced to seal off the afflicted section and slowly release the pressure into the rest of the ship.

No further attacks occurred and &quot;Halibut&quot; was able to move sluggishly up to around , her nominal test depth. The crew toiled with repairs, and when night came she resurfaced and headed towards her sister ships. The radar was repaired, although &quot;Halibut&quot; was without depth gauges, main compasses, gyros, radio, and a number of other systems. Most of the damage was actually to the hull and its fittings. At around 21:30 she encountered of the wolf pack that was working to the north of &quot;Halibut&quot;. After transferring a message to &quot;Pintado&quot; was ordered to escort &quot;Halibut&quot; the entire to Saipan. &quot;Halibut&quot; made a single brief dive during the journey; this was the last time she was ever submerged. At noon on 19 November she entered Tanapag Harbor.

The gallant submarine received the Navy Unit Commendation for her performance on this patrol. However, as a result of this action, damages incurred on her meant that she could no longer patrol for the rest of the war.

==Fate==
&quot;Halibut&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor on 1 December. It was quickly determined that her damage was too extensive to justify repair and thus was a constructive total loss. She was sent to New London, where she could be used as an alongside school ship. Her command was transferred to Guy Gugliotta and she left Pearl Harbor on 5 December arriving at San Francisco on 12 December.

She sailed 16 February 1945 for Portsmouth, New Hampshire. She was decommissioned 18 July 1945 and was sold for $23,123 (currently $) as scrap on 10 January 1947 to Quaker Shipyard and Machinery Company of Camden, New Jersey.

&quot;Halibut&quot; received seven battle stars for World War II service. She had steamed over , sunk twelve ships and damaged at least nine others. War patrols 3 through 7, 9 and 10 were designated successful.

==Legacy==
The battle flag of &quot;Halibut&quot;, along with photos of her crew and other artifacts, can be seen at the USS &quot;Bowfin&quot; Submarine Museum and park, next to the USS &quot;Arizona&quot; Memorial Visitor Center in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.

<doc id="411755" wikidata="Q2032759" url="?curid=411755" title="USS Halibut (SSGN-587)">
<text>USS &quot;Halibut&quot; (SSGN-587), a unique nuclear-powered guided missile submarine-turned-special operations platform, later redesignated as an attack submarine SSN-587, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named after the halibut.

==Operational history==
&quot;Halibut&quot;″s keel was laid down by Mare Island Naval Shipyard at Vallejo, California, on 11 April 1957. She was launched on 9 January 1959, sponsored by Vernice Holifield, wife of Congressman Chet Holifield of California, and commissioned on 4 January 1960.

===Regulus deterrence patrols, 1960 – 1965===

&quot;Halibut&quot; was originally designed under project SCB 137 as a diesel-electric submarine, but was completed with nuclear power under SCB 137A. She was the first submarine initially designed to launch guided missiles. Intended to carry the Regulus I and Regulus II nuclear cruise missiles, her main deck was high above the waterline to provide a dry &quot;flight deck.&quot; Her missile system was completely automated, with hydraulic machinery controlled from a central control station.

&quot;Halibut&quot; departed on her shakedown cruise 11 March 1960. On 25 March, underway to Australia, she became the first nuclear-powered submarine to successfully launch a guided missile. She returned to Mare Island Naval Shipyard on 18 June 1960, and after short training cruises sailed 7 November for Pearl Harbor to join the Pacific Fleet. During her first deployment she successfully launched her seventh consecutive Regulus I missile during a major Southeast Asia Treaty Organization weapons demonstration. Returning to Pearl Harbor on 9 April 1961, &quot;Halibut&quot; began her second deployment 1 May. During subsequent cruises, she participated in several missile firing exercises and underwent training.

&quot;Halibut&quot; deployed for the third time to the Western Pacific in late 1961, establishing a pattern of training and readiness operations followed through 1964. On 4 May 1964 &quot;Halibut&quot; departed Pearl Harbor for the last Regulus missile patrol to be made by a submarine in the Pacific. In total, between February 1961 and July 1964, &quot;Halibut&quot; undertook a total of seven deterrent patrols before being replaced in the Pacific by UGM-27 Polaris-equipped submarines of the Lafayette class. From September through December 1964, &quot;Halibut&quot; joined eight other submarines in testing and evaluating the attack capabilities of the &quot;Permit&quot;-class submarine.

According to the documentary &quot;Regulus: The First Nuclear Missile Submarines&quot; the primary target for &quot;Halibut&quot; in the event of a nuclear exchange would be to eliminate the Soviet naval base at Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. The patrols made by &quot;Halibut&quot; and its sister Regulus-firing submarines represented the first ever deterrent patrols in the history of the submarine navy, preceding those made by the Polaris missile firing submarines.

===Special operations missions, 1965 – 1976===
====Conversion for special operations (1965)====

In 1965, John P. Craven was recruited to Operation Sand Dollar by US Naval Intelligence to build a submarine that would &quot;... Hover in place [...] and dangle cameras miles down, deep enough to scout the ocean bottom for Soviet Treasures...&quot;.

Craven was provided with a selection of either USS &quot;Seawolf&quot; or USS &quot;Halibut&quot; to convert as the budget could not commission a new, purpose-built vessel. Preferring USS &quot;Halibut&quot;, he was awarded $70 million in February 1965 to &quot;...Out-fit her with electronic, sonic, photographic, and video gadgets...&quot;. &quot;Halibut&quot; entered Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for a major overhaul, and on 15 August was redesignated as an attack submarine with the hull classification symbol SSN-587.

====Chronology of special operations (1965–1976)====

She sailed from Pearl Harbor on 6 September for the West Coast, arriving at Keyport, Washington, on 20 September. On 5 October she departed Keyport for Pearl Harbor and, after an eight-day stop over at Mare Island, California, arrived 21 October. &quot;Halibut&quot; then began ASW operations in the area, continuing until August 1968 when she transferred to Mare Island for overhaul and installation of: side thrusters; hangar section sea lock; anchoring winches with fore and aft mushroom anchors; saturation diving (mixed gas) habitat; long and short range side-look sonar; video and photographic equipment; Sperry UNIVAC 1224 mainframe computer; induction tapping and recording equipment; port and starboard, fore and aft seabed skids (&quot;sneakers&quot;); towed underwater search vehicle (&quot;fish&quot;) and winch; and other specialized oceanographic equipment. She returned to Pearl Harbor in 1970 and operated with the Pacific Fleet and Submarine Development Group One (SubDevGruOne) out of Naval Submarine Support Facility San Diego (present day Naval Base Point Loma / Ballast Point) with attachment offices at Mare Island until decommissioning in 1976.
&quot;Halibut&quot; was used on underwater espionage missions by the US against the Soviet Union. Her most notable accomplishments include:
* The underwater tapping of a Soviet communication line running from the Kamchatka peninsula west to the Soviet mainland in the Sea of Okhotsk (Operation Ivy Bells)
* Surveying sunken Soviet submarine &quot;K-129&quot; in August 1968, prior to the CIA&#x27;s Project Azorian.

The latter mission is profiled in the 1996 book, &quot;Spy Sub – A Top Secret Mission to the Bottom of the Pacific&quot;, by Dr. Roger C. Dunham, although Dunham was required to change the name of &quot;Halibut&quot; to that of the non-existent USS &quot;Viperfish&quot; with a false hull number of SSN-655 to pass Department of Defense security restrictions for publication.

==Final disposition==
&quot;Halibut&quot; was decommissioned on 30 June 1976. She was &quot;mothballed&quot; at Keyport/Bangor Trident Base, Washington in 1976, struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 30 April 1986, and disposed of through the Ship-Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington, on 9 September 1994.

==Awards and commendations==

In April 1997, officers and men of &quot;Halibut&quot; and the other four US Navy submarines that conducted strategic deterrent patrols in the Western Pacific between 1959 and 1964 were awarded the right to wear the Navy&#x27;s SSBN Deterrent Patrol insignia.

===Presidential Unit Citation – 1968===

<doc id="411760" wikidata="Q1092481" url="?curid=411760" title="OpenRISC">
<text>OpenRISC is a project to develop a series of open-source hardware based central processing units (CPUs) on established reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles. It includes an instruction set architecture (ISA) using an open-source license. It is the original flagship project of the OpenCores community.

The first (and only) architectural description is for the OpenRISC 1000 (&quot;OR1k&quot;), describing a family of 32-bit and 64-bit processors with optional floating-point arithmetic and vector processing support.
The OpenRISC 1200 implementation of this specification was designed by Damjan Lampret in 2000, written in the Verilog hardware description language (HDL). The later mor1kx implementation, which has some advantages compared to the OR 1200, was designed by Julius Baxter and is also written in Verilog. Software simulators also exist which implement the OR1k specification. 

The hardware design was released under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), while the models and firmware were released under the GNU General Public License (GPL).

A reference system on a chip (SoC) implementation based on the OpenRISC 1200 was developed, named the &quot;OpenRISC Reference Platform System-on-Chip&quot; (ORPSoC). Several groups have demonstrated ORPSoC and other OR1200 based designs running on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and there have been several commercial derivatives produced.

Later SoC designs, also based on an OpenRisc 1000 CPU implementation, are minSoC, OpTiMSoC and MiSoC.

==Instruction set==
The instruction set is a reasonably simple traditional RISC architecture reminiscent of MIPS using a 3-operand load-store architecture, with 16 or 32 general-purpose registers and a fixed 32-bit instruction length. The instruction set is mostly identical between the 32- and 64-bit versions of the specification, the main difference being the register width (32 or 64 bits) and page table layout. The OpenRISC specification includes all features common to modern desktop and server processors: a supervisor mode and virtual memory system, optional read, write, and execute control for memory pages, and instructions for synchronizing and interrupt handling between multiple processors.

Another notable feature is a rich set of &quot;single instruction, multiple data&quot; (SIMD) instructions intended for digital signal processing.

==Implementations==
Most implementations are on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) which give the possibility to iterate on the design at the cost of performance.

By 2018, the OpenRISC 1000 was considered stable, so ORSoC (owner of OpenCores) began a crowdfunding project to build a cost-efficient application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) to get improved performance. ORSoC faced criticism for this from the community. The project did not reach the goal.

, no open-source ASIC had been produced.

===Commercial implementations===
Several commercial organizations have developed derivatives of the OpenRISC 1000 architecture, including the ORC32-1208 from ORSoC and the BA12, BA14, and BA22 from Beyond Semiconductor. Dynalith Systems provide the iNCITE FPGA prototyping board, which can run both the OpenRISC 1000 and BA12. Flextronics (Flex) and Jennic Limited manufactured the OpenRISC as part of an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). Samsung uses the OpenRISC 1000 in their DTV system-on-chips (SDP83 B-Series, SDP92 C-Series, SDP1001/SDP1002 D-Series, SDP1103/SDP1106 E-Series). Allwinner Technology are reported to use an OpenRISC core in their AR100 power controller, which forms part of the A31 ARM-based SoC.

Cadence Design Systems have begun using OpenRISC as a reference architecture in documenting tool chain flows (for example the UVM reference flow, now contributed to Accellera).

TechEdSat, the first NASA OpenRISC architecture based Linux computer launched in July 2012, and was deployed in October 2012 to the International Space Station with hardware provided, built, and tested by ÅAC Microtec and ÅAC Microtec North America.

===Academic and non-commercial use===
Being open source, OpenRISC has proved popular in academic and hobbyist circles. For example, Stefan Wallentowitz and his team at the Institute for Integrated Systems at the Technische Universität München have used OpenRISC in research into multi-core processor architectures.
The &quot;Open Source Hardware User Group&quot; (OSHUG) in the UK has on two occasions run sessions on OpenRISC, while hobbyist Sven-Åke Andersson has written a comprehensive blog on OpenRISC for beginners, which attracted the interest of &quot;Electronic Engineering Times&quot; (EE Times).
Sebastian Macke has implemented jor1k, an OpenRISC 1000 emulator in JavaScript, running Linux with X Window System and Wayland support.

==Toolchain support==
The OpenRISC community have ported the GNU toolchain to OpenRISC to support development in the programming languages C and C++. Using this toolchain the newlib, uClibc, musl (as of release 1.1.4), and glibc libraries have been ported to the processor. Dynalith provides OpenIDEA, a graphical integrated development environment (IDE) based on this toolchain. A project to port LLVM to the OpenRISC 1000 architecture began in early 2012.

GCC 9 released with OpenRISC support.

The OR1K project provides an instruction set simulator, or1ksim. The flagship implementation, the OR1200, is a register-transfer level (RTL) model in Verilog HDL, from which a SystemC-based cycle-accurate model can be built in ORPSoC. A high speed model of the OpenRISC 1200 is also available through the Open Virtual Platforms (OVP) initiative (see OVPsim), set up by Imperas.

==Operating system support==

===Linux support===
The mainline Linux kernel gained support for OpenRISC in version 3.1.
The implementation merged in this release is the 32-bit OpenRISC 1000 family (or1k). Formerly OpenRISC 1000 architecture, it has been superseded by the mainline port.

===RTOS support===
Several real-time operating systems (RTOS) have been ported to OpenRISC, including NuttX, RTEMS, FreeRTOS, and eCos.

==QEMU support==
Since version 1.2, QEMU supports emulating OpenRISC platforms.

<text>Kirkham aka Kirkam-in-[[Amounderness Hundred|Amounderness]] is a market town and civil parish in the Borough of Fylde in Lancashire, England, midway between Blackpool and Preston and adjacent to the town of Wesham. It owes its existence to Carr Hill upon which it was built and which was the location of a Roman fort. At the census of 2011, it had a population 3,304 (Kirkham South) plus 3,890 (Kirkham North), giving a total of 7,194. By the census of 2021 the total had risen to 3,217 (Kirkham South) plus 4,666 (Kirkham North), giving a total of 7,883.

==History==
In his 1878 &quot;History of the Fylde of Lancashire&quot;, John Porter described Kirkham as &quot;.. probably the earliest inhabited locality in the Fylde district.&quot; Remains found at Carleton in the 1970s of an elk with two harpoons embedded suggest that the Fylde was inhabited as long ago as 8,000 BC.

The town is pre-Roman in its origin with a name originating from the Danish &quot;kirk&quot; (church) and &quot;-ham&quot; (Saxon for settlement, or &quot;home&quot;). The town owes its existence to Carr Hill upon which it was built and which was the location of a Roman fort. It appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 under the name of &quot;Chicheham&quot; and is described as lying on the Roman road between Ribchester (Bremetennacum) and the River Wyre. The town&#x27;s market charter was granted in 1269–70 by King Henry III.

In the 15th and 16th centuries Kirkham remained a small market town. But from the late 17th century the town grew into a thriving textile centre. From 1830 sailcloth was being woven in cottages in the town and later at the Flax Mill, built in 1861 by John Birley. Kirkham Grammar School was founded in 1549 but the original building no longer exists.

In 1792 a Roman brass shield boss was discovered by local schoolmaster John Willacy, in the Dow Brook, in Mill Hill Field. Willacy sold the shield to a Scotsman, but it found its way to the Charles Townley collection in Burnley and from there to the British Museum. The oval shield, about in diameter, bore the representation of a human figure, seated, with an eagle to the left and an athlete at the side.

Horse racing took place at Carr Hill in Kirkham in March 1852 and again in March 1853. Point-to-point races were still being staged at Thornley-with-Wheatley, near Preston, by the Kirkham Hunt in the 20th century, including a meeting on Friday 6 April 1900. Races at Carr Hill continued up to the start of World War II, but it is uncertain whether they began again after the War had ended.

In 1887 a memorial was erected, at Town End, to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. The memorial was later moved to a site adjacent to the United Reformed Church.

Looms ran in the town from about 1850 until 2003. At one time the town had eleven mills, the last to be built being Progress Mill in 1915. On the lower part of Station Road &quot;The Last Loom&quot; of Kirkham is on permanent public display. This loom, a cross-rod type from the 1920s, with the use of tappets at the side, could produce an extensive range of fabrics including velvets, twills and Bedford cord.

In 1925, Church Street became the subject of a pencil on paper drawing by Pendlebury artist L. S. Lowry In his later &quot;A Lancashire Village, 1935&quot; he painted the scene again, but with a wider street full of people and a house in front of the church.

Due to an expansion of secondary education after the Second World War, Carr Hill Secondary Modern School (now part of an academy trust), was built in 1957 on the site of Carr Hill House and a former racecourse. It was officially opened in 1958 by the Duchess of Kent. Several housing developments have been built on the edge of the town since the late 20th century.

===Governance===
The town council for Kirkham is elected as a parish council, which has six elected councillors and operates under the name &quot;Kirkham Town Council&quot;. The council manages local services such as waste management, community spaces, planning permission and council tax among others.

The Lancashire County Council councillor is Stewart Jones. In the 2023 local elections the three Fylde Council seats were won by Edward Collins, Damian Buckley and Paul Hodgson (all Independent).

===Regeneration===
In 2022 Fylde Borough Council purchased Grade II listed &quot;Hillside&quot; on Preston Street and the former Lloyds Bank on Poulton Street, as part of the town&#x27;s £10m regeneration plan, Kirkham Futures. &quot;Hillside&quot; was a former restaurant and popular wedding venue, but both buildings had been empty for some years. The former bank, which was originally a Charity Girls School dating back to 1860, was hoped to be converted into a community cinema, but it was later decided to convert it to a hospitality venue.

Kirkham Futures is a four-year plan, led by Fylde Council&#x27;s regeneration team, in partnership with Lancashire County Council and Kirkham Town Council, which will use a £6.3m grant from the Government&#x27;s Future High Streets Fund (FHSF).

In January 2023, the town&#x27;s Market Square closed for up to 52 weeks for town centre improvements to be carried out. The Phase 1 Public Realm works for Kirkham will replace existing public realm and infrastructure, such as street furniture, in the area of Market Square and Poulton Street. Included in the contract is a five-year maintenance and repair commitment by the contractor, after which such upkeep would be included in existing revenue budgets. A lighting scheme to be implemented in Market Square will be maintained and repaired within the existing revenue budget provision. The contract was awarded to Eric Wright Civil Engineering Ltd following a successful procurement exercise.

In 2023 and 2024 a cooperative partnership funded a programme of events inspired by the former Roman presence in Kirkham and Wesham, allowing the community to participate in art and archaeology projects. Activities included a community archaeology project, a high street mural and a heritage-inspired art and lantern festival.

The improvement of the Market Square, following the £9.5M town centre regeneration plan, was completed in August 2024 and a ban on parking was introduced by Lancashire County Council. All on-street and off-street parking in the town is free and the council noted there were &quot;ample&quot; alternatives to the square, including the car parks at Eagles Court and Mill Street. The ban excluded vehicles needing access for the market and events.

==Education==
Kirkham has two secondary schools: Carr Hill High School a mixed comprehensive school, and Kirkham Grammar School, an independent school. Feeding into these two schools are the primary schools of Kirkham: Kirkham and Wesham Primary School, Kirkham Grammar Junior School, St John the Evangelist (also known as &quot;The Willows&quot;) Catholic Primary School and Kirkham St Michael&#x27;s C of E Primary School. Additionally, Pear Tree School offers special education for children and young people, aged 2-19, with severe and profound and multiple learning difficulties.

==Churches==
The Church of England parish church is St Michael&#x27;s whose minister is Fr Richard Dashwood.

The United Reformed Church on Poulton Street is a Grade II listed building and is an early example of the work of the architectural practice of Briggs &amp; Wolstenholme. It has a &quot;massing and prominent spire rising from a tall tower&quot; and was built in 1896. In 1995 a large single-storey rear extension, including a basement, was built to accommodate a youth centre, meeting rooms, kitchen and toilets. In about 2000 the vestibule was extended forward to the same level as the balcony above.

There is also a Roman Catholic church – St John the Evangelist, built in 1845, but known locally as &quot;The Willows&quot; – on the Ribby Road, and a Methodist church on Nelson Street.

Zion (Independent) Chapel was founded in 1818. Although the church has long since been demolished, the graveyard remains. Now associated with Kirkham United Reformed Church, but adjacent to the Manse Nursing Home in the centre of the town, this unusual isolated burial-ground is still well maintained.

==Location and amenities==
Kirkham lies at the centre of a relatively rich agricultural area. By the mid 18th century, however, the manufacture of sail cloth and the flax-weaving industry had become well established in the town. By 1876 there were several factories employing almost 1,000 workers in the cotton and other industries and by the end of the century the town had grown considerably in importance.

Kirkham and Wesham railway station was opened in 1840 as &quot;Kirkham Station&quot;, when the Preston and Wyre Railway and Harbour Company opened its line to Fleetwood. South of the town is Kirkham Prison, an open prison built on part of the site of the Royal Air Force base which closed in 1957.

The small library located on Station Road has been open since 1939 and has recently reopened following a major refurbishment.
Kirkham Club Day, an annual gala, is held in early June, jointly with Wesham. The day involves the various churches and their chosen &quot;Rose Queens&quot;, together with biblical tableau floats, civic dignitaries and brass bands, walking in procession through the town in the morning.

The town&#x27;s War Memorial is located in a small memorial garden on Barnfield.

The St George Hotel was situated at the bottom on Station Road, at Town End, but closed in 2011 and was demolished in 2012 to make way for a block of flats.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North West and ITV Granada. Television signals are received from the Winter Hill TV transmitter. 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Lancashire, Heart North West, Smooth North West, Capital Manchester and Lancashire, Greatest Hits Radio Lancashire and Central Radio North West, a community based station which broadcast from Preston. 

The town is served by its own free newspaper, the &quot;Kirkham and Wesham Advertiser&quot;. Both the &quot;Blackpool Gazette&quot; and the &quot;Lancashire Evening Post&quot; cover Kirkham news, as does the weekly &quot;Kirkham and Fylde Express&quot;.

==Sport==
Kirkham Swimming Baths, erected in 1914 by the bequest of William Segar Hodgson J.P. served Kirkham as a public swimming pool for over a century. In February 2008 a campaign was initiated to save the baths from closure which included a public march through Kirkham and Wesham attended by some 3,000 local supporters A local action group was subsequently formed to organise the longer term survival of the baths, and was successful in presenting a business plan to Fylde Borough Council. The baths, were run by the YMCA, having been re-branded as &quot;Rural Splash&quot;, but closed permanently after suffering significant structural damage caused by Storm Arwen in December 2021. In December 2024 it was announced that CIC Wave Reach had withdrawn from its role in acquiring and operating Kirkham Pool. On 30 January 2025, Fylde Borough Council approved approved plans to acquire the pool for the nominal sum of £1.

The town&#x27;s football club is AFC Fylde. The club was known as Kirkham and Wesham F.C until the end of the 2007–08 season, and was formed by the amalgamation of Kirkham Town F.C. and Wesham F.C. The change of name to AFC Fylde was made to try to encourage a broader fan-base from across the Fylde coast.

AFC Fylde is currently based north of Wesham on the Mill Farm complex and plays in the National League. The team won the FA Vase in the 2007–08 season, beating Lowestoft Town in the final at Wembley Stadium on 11 May 2008. They were also promoted to the North West Counties Football League Premier Division after finishing second in Division Two. In 2008–09 they were North West Counties Football League champions and so won promotion to the Northern Premier League Division One North.

In May 2022 the British Lawn Mower Racing Association staged a meeting at Sunfield Farm, off Freckleton Road, to help to raise money for the people of Ukraine.

==Twin towns==
Kirkham is twinned with both Ancenis in Loire-Atlantique, France and Bad Brückenau, a spa town in Bad Kissingen district, northern Bavaria which is situated in the Rhön Mountains in Germany. Kirkham has an active Twinning Association and has regular contact with both Ancenis and Bad Brückenau.

==Places of interest==

<doc id="411765" wikidata="Q767860" url="?curid=411765" title="Research Triangle">
<text>The Research Triangle, or simply The Triangle, are both common nicknames for a metropolitan area in the Piedmont region of the U.S. state of North Carolina. Anchored by the cities of Raleigh and Durham and the town of Chapel Hill, the region is home to three major research universities: North Carolina State University, Duke University, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, respectively. The &quot;Triangle&quot; name originated in the 1950s with the creation of Research Triangle Park located between the three anchor cities, which is the largest research park in the United States and home to numerous high tech companies. 

The nine-county region, officially named the Raleigh–Durham–Cary, NC [[Combined Statistical Area]] by the Office of Management and Budget, comprises the Raleigh–Cary, Durham–Chapel Hill, and Henderson, NC Metropolitan Statistical Areas. The 2020 census put the population of the area at 2,106,463, making it the second-largest combined statistical area in North Carolina, behind Charlotte. The Raleigh–Durham television market includes a broader 24-county area which includes Fayetteville, North Carolina, and has a population of 2,726,000 persons. Most of the Triangle is part of North Carolina&#x27;s first, second, fourth, ninth, and thirteenth congressional districts.

The region is sometimes confused with the Piedmont Triad, which is a North Carolina region adjacent to and directly west of the Triangle comprising Greensboro, Winston-Salem, and High Point, among other cities. Both the Research Triangle and the Piedmont Triad form part of the Piedmont Crescent, a heavily urbanized region of the state that includes the city of Charlotte.

== Definitions ==

Depending on which definition of the Research Triangle region is used, as few as three or as many as 16 counties are included as part of the region. The three core counties of Wake, Durham, and Orange are the homes of the three research universities for which the area is named.

=== Combined Statistical Area ===
As of September 14, 2018, the US Office of Management and Budget (OMB) delineated the Raleigh-Durham-Cary Combined Statistical Area as consisting of two metropolitan and one micropolitan statistical areas. Those three statistical areas in turn are defined as consisting of a total of nine counties. The MSAs and their constituent counties are:
* Durham-Chapel Hill MSA
** Chatham County
** Durham County
** Granville County
** Orange County
** Person County
* Henderson μSA
** Vance County
* Raleigh-Cary MSA
** Franklin County
** Johnston County
** Wake County

Prior to September 2018, the OMB had used the name Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill Combined Statistical Area and it included several additional counties. The Dunn Micropolitan Statistical Area (Harnett County) and Sanford Micropolitan Statistical Area (Lee County) were moved to the Fayetteville-Sanford-Lumberton Combined Statistical Area, while the Oxford Micropolitan Statistical Area (Granville County) was folded into the Durham-Chapel Hill Metropolitan Statistical Area. The Raleigh Metropolitan Statistical Area was also renamed the Raleigh-Cary Metropolitan Statistical Area.

The table below outlines the populations of the constituent counties of the Raleigh–Durham-Cary Combined Statistical Area as of the 2020 Census.
=== Regional partnerships ===
The members of the Research Triangle Regional Partnership are:
* Chatham
* Durham
* Franklin
* Granville
* Harnett
* Johnston
* Lee
* Nash
* Orange
* Person
* Wake
* Warren
* Wilson

All counties in North Carolina are in one of 16 regional councils which provide programs and services to local governments. The Triangle J Council of Governments includes Chatham, Durham, Johnston, Lee, Moore, Orange, and Wake Counties. The northern Triangle counties of Person, Granville, Franklin, Vance, and Warren are part of the Kerr-Tar Regional Council of Governments.

== Cities ==
The Triangle region, as defined for statistical purposes as the Raleigh–Durham–Cary CSA, comprises nine counties, although the U.S. Census Bureau divided the region into two metropolitan statistical areas and one micropolitan area in 2003. The Raleigh-Cary metropolitan area comprises Wake, Franklin, and Johnston Counties; the Durham-Chapel Hill metropolitan area comprises Durham, Orange, Chatham, Granville, and Person Counties; and the Henderson micropolitan area comprises Vance County.

Some area television stations define the region as Raleigh–Durham–Fayetteville. Fayetteville is more than from Raleigh, but is part of the Triangle television market.
== Education ==
Public secondary education in the Triangle is similar to that of the majority of the state of North Carolina, in which there are county-wide school systems (the exception is Chapel Hill-Carrboro City Schools within Orange County but apart from Orange County Schools). Based in Cary, the Wake County Public School System, which includes the cities of Raleigh and Cary, is the largest school system in the state of North Carolina and the 15th-largest in the United States, with average daily enrollment of 159,949 as of the second month of the 2016–17 school year. Other larger systems in the region include Durham Public Schools (about 33,000 students) and rapidly growing Johnston County Schools (about 31,000 students).

=== Institutions of higher education ===

* Campbell University
* Central Carolina Community College
* Duke University
* Durham Technical Community College
* ECPI University, Raleigh campus
* Louisburg College
* Meredith College
* Montreat College&#x27;s School of Professional and Adult Studies
* North Carolina Central University

== Sports ==

=== College sports ===
With the significant number of universities and colleges in the area and the relative absence of major league professional sports, NCAA sports are very popular, particularly those sports in which the Atlantic Coast Conference participates, most notably basketball.

The Duke Blue Devils (representing Duke University in Durham), NC State Wolfpack (representing North Carolina State University in Raleigh), and North Carolina Tar Heels (representing the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) are all members of the ACC. Rivalries among these schools are very strong, fueled by proximity to each other, with annual competitions in every sport. Adding to the rivalries is the large number of graduates the high schools in the region send to each of the local universities. It is very common for students at one university to know many students attending the other local universities, which increases the opportunities for &quot;bragging&quot; among the schools. The four ACC schools in the state, Duke, North Carolina, North Carolina State, and Wake Forest University (the last of which was originally located in the town of Wake Forest before moving to Winston-Salem in 1956), are referred to as Tobacco Road by sportscasters, particularly in basketball. All four teams consistently produce high-caliber teams . Each of the Triangle-based universities listed has won at least two NCAA Basketball national championships.

Three historically black colleges, including recent Division I arrival North Carolina Central University and Division II members St. Augustine College and Shaw University also boost the popularity of college sports in the region.

Other colleges in the Triangle that field intercollegiate teams include Campbell University, Meredith College, and William Peace University.

The Triangle will host the World University Summer Games in 2029.

=== Professional sports ===

The region has only one professional team of the four major sports, the Carolina Hurricanes of the National Hockey League, based in Raleigh. Since moving to the Research Triangle region from Hartford, Connecticut, they have enjoyed great success, including winning a Stanley Cup. The North Carolina Courage began play in the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League in 2017 after the owner of North Carolina FC bought the NWSL franchise rights of the Western New York Flash and relocated the NWSL franchise to the Triangle. The team has achieved broad success in the league, winning 2 NWSL championships and 3 NWSL Shields in the first five years in the Triangle. With limited top-level professional sports option, minor league sports are quite popular in the region. The Durham Bulls in downtown Durham are a AAA Minor League baseball affiliate of the Tampa Bay Rays, and the Carolina Mudcats, based in Zebulon, are the Advanced-A affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers. In Cary, North Carolina FC plays in the second-tier USL Championship

The area also had a team in the fledgling World League of American Football – however, the Raleigh–Durham Skyhawks, coached by Roman Gabriel, did not exactly cover themselves in glory; they lost all 10 games of their inaugural (and only) season in 1991. The team folded after that, being replaced in the league by the Ohio Glory, which fared little better at 1–9, ultimately suffering the same fate – along with the other six teams based in North America – when the league took a two-year hiatus, returning as a six-team all-European league in 1995. The Orange County Speedway in Rougemont hosts stock car racing events including the Pro All Stars Series, the CARS Super Late Model Tour and the CARS Late Model Stock Tour.

== Economy ==

The region&#x27;s growing high-technology community includes such companies as IBM, Lenovo, SAS Institute, Cisco Systems, NetApp, Red Hat, EMC Corporation, and Credit Suisse First Boston. In addition to high-tech, the region is consistently ranked in the top three in the U.S. with concentration in life science companies. Some of these companies include GlaxoSmithKline, Biogen Idec, BASF, Merck &amp; Co., Novo Nordisk, Novozymes, and Pfizer. Research Triangle Park and North Carolina State University&#x27;s Centennial Campus in Raleigh support innovation through R&amp;D and technology transfer among the region&#x27;s companies and research universities (including Duke University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill).

The area fared relatively well during the late-2000s recession, ranked as the strongest region in North Carolina by the Brookings Institution and among the top 40 in the country. The change in unemployment during 2008 to 2009 was 4.6% and home prices was 2%. The Greensboro metropolitan area was listed among the second-weakest and the Charlotte area among the middle in the country.

== Transportation ==

=== Freeways and primary designated routes ===

The Triangle proper is served by four major interstate highways: I-40, I-42, I-85, and I-87 along with their spurs: I-885, I-440, and I-540, and seven U.S. Routes: 1, 15, 64, 70, 264, 401, and 501. US Highways 15 and 501 are multiplexed through much of the region as US 15-501. I-95 passes 30 miles east of Raleigh through Johnston County, with I-87 connecting I-95 at Rocky Mount, NC to Raleigh via the US 64–264 Bypass.

The two interstates diverge from one another in Orange County, with I-85 heading northeast through northern Durham County toward Virginia, while I-40 travels southeast through southern Durham, through the center of the region, and serves as the primary freeway through Raleigh. The related loop freeways I-440 and I-540 are primarily located in Wake County around Raleigh. I-440 begins at the interchange of US 1 and I-40 southwest of downtown Raleigh and arcs as a multiplex with US 1 northward around downtown with the formal designation as the Cliff Benson/Raleigh Beltline (cosigned with US 1 on three-fourths of its northern route) and ends at its junction with I-40 in southeast Raleigh. I-540, sometimes known as the Raleigh Outer Loop, extends from the US 64–264 Bypass to I-40 just inside Durham County, where it continues across the interstate as a state route (NC 540), prior to it becoming a toll road from the NC 54 interchange to the current terminus at I-40 and I-42 near Garner. I-95 serves the extreme eastern edge of the region, crossing north–south through suburban Johnston County.

U.S. Routes 1, 15, and 64 primarily serve the region as limited-access freeways or multilane highways with access roads. US 1 enters the region from the southwest as the Claude E. Pope Memorial Highway and travels through suburban Apex where it merges with US 64 and continues northeast through Cary. The two highways are codesignated for about until US 1 joins I-440 and US 64 with I-40 along the Raleigh–Cary border. Capital Boulevard, which is designated US 1 for half of its route and US 401 the other is not a limited-access freeway, although it is a major thoroughfare through northeast Raleigh and into the northern downtown area.

North Carolina Highway 147 is a limited-access freeway that connects I-85 with Toll Route NC 540 in northwestern Wake County. The older, toll-free portion of the four-lane route—known as the Durham Freeway or the I.L. &quot;Buck&quot; Dean Expressway—traverses downtown Durham and extends through Research Triangle Park to I-40. The Durham Freeway is often used as a detour or alternate route for I-40 through southwestern Durham the Chapel Hill area in cases of traffic accident, congestion or road construction delays. The tolled portion of NC 147, called the Triangle Expressway—North Carolina&#x27;s first modern toll road when it opened to traffic in late 2011—continues past I-40 to Toll NC 540. Both Toll NC 147 and Toll NC 540 are modern facilities which collect tolls using transponders and license plate photo-capture technology.

=== Public transit ===
A partnering system of multiple public transportation agencies currently serves the Triangle region under the joint GoTriangle branding. Raleigh is served by GoRaleigh (formerly Capital Area Transit) municipal transit system, while Durham has GoDurham (formerly the Durham Area Transit Authority). Chapel Hill is served by Chapel Hill Transit, and Cary is served by GoCary (formerly C-Tran) public transit systems. However, GoTriangle, formerly called Triangle Transit, works in cooperation with all area transit systems by offering transfers between its own routes and those of the other systems. Triangle Transit also coordinates an extensive vanpool and rideshare program that serves the region&#x27;s larger employers and commute destinations.

Plans have been made to merge all of the area&#x27;s municipal systems into GoTriangle, and GoTriangle also has proposed a regional rail system to connect downtown Durham, downtown Cary and downtown Raleigh with multiple suburban stops, as well as stops in the Research Triangle Park area. The agency&#x27;s initial proposal was effectively cancelled in 2006, however, when the agency could not procure adequate federal funding. A committee of local business, transportation and government leaders currently are working with GoTriangle to develop a new transit blueprint for the region, with various modes of rail transit, as well as bus rapid transit, open as options for consideration.

===Air===

====Raleigh–Durham International Airport (RDU)====

Raleigh–Durham International Airport (RDU) has nonstop passenger service to 68 destinations with over 450 average daily departures, including nonstop international service to Canada, Europe, and Mexico. It is located near the geographic center of The Triangle, northeast of the town of Morrisville in Wake County. The airport covers 5,000 acres (2,023 ha) and has three runways.

In 1939 the General Assembly of North Carolina chartered the Raleigh–Durham Aeronautical Authority, which was changed in 1945 to the Raleigh–Durham Airport Authority. The first new terminal opened in 1955. Terminal A (now Terminal 1) opened in 1981. American Airlines began service to RDU in 1985.

RDU opened the runway, 5L-23R, in 1986. American Airlines opened its north–south hub operation at RDU in the new Terminal C in June 1987, greatly increasing the size of RDU&#x27;s operations with a new terminal including a new apron and runway. American brought RDU its first international flights to Bermuda, Cancun, Paris and London.

In 1996, American Airlines ceased its hub operations at RDU due to Pan Am and Eastern Airlines. Pan Am and Eastern were Miami&#x27;s main tenants until 1991, when both carriers went bankrupt. Their hubs at MIA were taken over by United Airlines and American Airlines. This created a difficulty in competing with US Airways&#x27; hub in Charlotte and Delta Air Lines&#x27; hub in Atlanta, Georgia for passengers traveling between smaller cities in the North and South. Midway Airlines entered the market, starting service in 1995 with the then somewhat novel concept of 50-seat Canadair Regional Jets providing service from its RDU hub primarily along the East Coast. Midway, originally incorporated in Chicago, had some success after moving its operations to the midpoint of the eastern United States at RDU and its headquarters to Morrisville, NC. The carrier ultimately could not overcome three weighty challenges: the arrival of Southwest Airlines, the refusal of American Airlines to renew the frequent flyer affiliation it had with Midway (thus dispatching numerous higher fare-paying businesspeople to airlines with better reward destinations), and the significant blow of September 11, 2001. Midway Airlines filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy on August 13, 2001, and ceased operations entirely on October 30, 2003.

In February 2000, RDU was ranked as the nation&#x27;s second fastest-growing major airport in the United States, by Airports Council International, based on 1999 statistics. Passenger growth hit 24% over the previous year, ranking RDU second only to Washington Dulles International Airport. RDU opened Terminal A south concourse for use by Northwest and Continental Airlines in 2001. The addition added and five aircraft gates to the terminal. Terminal A became designated as Terminal 1 on October 26, 2008. In 2003, RDU also dedicated a new general aviation terminal. RDU continues to keep pace with its growth by redeveloping Terminal C into a new state-of-the-art terminal, now known as Terminal 2, which opened in October 2008. 

As of June 2022, the airport will have international flights to Cancun, London, Montreal, Paris, Reykjavik and Toronto. Cancun and London service is provided by American, Frontier and JetBlue, while the Canada flights are provided by Air Canada, Paris by Delta, and Reykjavik by Icelandair. Icelandair is the first international carrier outside of Air Canada to service the airport. Delta Air Lines currently considers the airport to be a &quot;focus city&quot;, or an airport that is not a hub, but is of importance to the carrier. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly shrunk the operation, but by September 2022, Delta will be serving 21 destinations on aircraft ranging from the CRJ700 to the 767.

==== Public general-aviation airports ====
In addition to RDU, several smaller publicly owned general-aviation airports also operate in the metropolitan region:

<text>Emperor Min of Jin (; 300 – February 7, 318), personal name Sima Ye (司馬鄴 or 司馬業), courtesy name Yanqi (彥旗), was an emperor of the Jin dynasty and the last of the Western Jin.

Emperor Min surrendered in 316 to Liu Yao, a general of the Xiongnu state Han-Zhao, and was later executed by Liu Cong, the emperor of Han, in 318 – like his uncle Emperor Huai had been in 313.

== Prior to becoming emperor ==
Sima Ye was a son of Sima Yan (司馬晏), Prince Xiao of Wu, a son of Jin&#x27;s founding emperor Emperor Wu, and Lady Xun, a daughter of Xun Xu. However, he was made the heir of his uncle Sima Jian (司馬柬) the Prince of Qin (and the only full brother of Emperor Hui to live to adulthood), who died on 23 October 291, about nine years before his birth; Sima Ye inherited the title of Prince of Qin from Jian&#x27;s immediate successor, who was killed by Sima Lun.

The years following Sima Ye&#x27;s birth saw an increase in the intensity of the struggle among the Jin imperial princes to become Emperor Hui&#x27;s regent (War of the Eight Princes). By the time Sima Ye was seven, Emperor Hui had died, Sima Yue continued to be regent under Emperor Huai&#x27;s nominal rule and Jin imperial authority had been greatly weakened.

When the Jin capital Luoyang fell to Han-Zhao forces on 13 July 311, Prince Ye&#x27;s uncle Emperor Huai was captured; his father Prince Yan and eldest brother (whose name was unrecorded), as well as his cousin Sima Quan the crown prince, were killed. Prince Ye himself, at age 11, was able to escape from Han forces, and he got to Mi (密縣, in modern Zhengzhou, Henan) when he encountered his uncles, the Jin officials Xun Fan and Xun Zu (荀組), who decided to support him as their leader. Later that year, the general Yan Ding tried to escort Prince Ye into the Guanzhong region (modern central Shaanxi), where he thought the central government could be rebuilt, but on the way, most of the supporters and troops deserted them—including Prince Ye&#x27;s uncles. Eventually, however, Yan and Prince Ye were able to arrive in Guanzhong. They were supported by the general Jia Ya, and Jia was able to capture Chang&#x27;an in 312, allowing Prince Ye to enter and set up his headquarters there. On 19 October 312, Jia and Yan offered Prince Ye the title of crown prince, and they then organized a provisional government.

== Reign ==
In spring 313, the captured Emperor Huai was executed by the Han emperor Liu Cong. The news, however, took three months to get to Chang&#x27;an. Once it did, Crown Prince Ye held an official mourning for his uncle and then ascended the throne as emperor. At that time, the city of Chang&#x27;an was so poor that it had less than a hundred households, and there were only four wagons available. The officials lacked official uniforms and seals. The military matters were largely entrusted to the generals Qu Yun and Suo Chen. Emperor Min issued an edict ordering Sima Bao, the Prince of Nanyang, who still had a sizable force in Qin Province (秦州, modern eastern Gansu), and Sima Rui, the Prince of Langya, who held large portions of territory near and south of the Yangtze River, to come to his aid, but both Sima Bao and Sima Rui only paid nominal allegiance to him and failed to actually provide any assistance. Around the new year of 314, Han made a surprise attack on Chang&#x27;an, and while that attack was thwarted that time, it showed that the Jin regime under Emperor Min lacked the power to defend itself. Only Zhang Gui, the governor of Liang Province (涼州, modern central and western Gansu), sent small detachments and supplies periodically to Chang&#x27;an. In 315, Sima Bao considered coming to Emperor Min&#x27;s aid, but ultimately did not do so, and Suo subsequently refused a plan to send the emperor to Sima Bao, reasoning that Sima Bao would then use the emperor as a puppet.

In fall 316, the Han general Liu Yao, the Prince of Zhongshan, made a major attack against Emperor Min&#x27;s territory. After he captured the Beidi Commandery (北地, roughly modern Tongchuan, Shaanxi), the other Jin cities in Guanzhong collapsed. Two relief forces arrived but were hesitant to engage Liu Yao. Liu Yao therefore was able to besiege Chang&#x27;an, and after the food supply ran out, Emperor Min resolved to surrender. He was delivered by Liu Yao to the Han capital Pingyang (平陽, in modern Linfen, Shanxi).

== After capture by Han-Zhao ==
Liu Cong initially created the former Jin emperor the Marquess of Huai&#x27;an. In early 318, at a feast, he had the marquess serve as butler, and a number of former Jin officials could not control themselves and cried out loud at their former emperor&#x27;s humiliation. Furthermore, around this time, there were a number of uprisings against Han, each claiming to want to capture Han&#x27;s crown prince Liu Can to exchange him for the former Jin emperor. Liu Can therefore recommended that Sima Ye be executed, and Liu Cong agreed, executing him after receiving Liu Can&#x27;s report.

<text>The Kremlin Arsenal () is a former armory built within the grounds of the Moscow Kremlin in Russia. Initially constructed in 1736, it has been rebuilt several times. It remains in military use to date, unlike the Kremlin Armoury, another arsenal within the walls of the Moscow Kremlin, which is now a museum. The building is off-limits to tourists. 

==Building==
The Kremlin Arsenal is a large elongated trapezoid two-storey building with a large courtyard. It occupies most of the northern corner of the Moscow Kremlin.

==History==

In the Middle Ages, the spot was occupied by granaries. After they burnt down in the last years of the 17th century, Peter the Great engaged a team of Russian and German architects to construct the Kremlin Arsenal, designed to be one of the largest buildings in Moscow at the time. Construction started in 1702, but was interrupted due to lack of funds during the Great Northern War with Sweden, and was only completed in 1736, under supervision of Field-Marshal Burkhard Christoph von Münnich. The new building was gutted by a fire in 1737, and only restored from 1786-1796.

During Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Russia, the retreating French soldiers had the central part of the building blown up. It was restored between 1816 and 1828 to a Neoclassical design in order to house a museum dedicated to the Russian victory over Napoleon.

<doc id="411772" wikidata="Q12721" url="?curid=411772" title="Monocle">
<text>A monocle is a type of corrective lens used to correct or enhance the visual perception in only one eye. It consists of a circular lens placed in front of the eye and held in place by the eye socket itself. Often, to avoid losing the monocle, a string or wire is connected to the wearer&#x27;s clothing at one end and, at the other end, to either a hole in the lens or, more often, a wire ring around its circumference.

==Origins==
The Prussian antiquarian Philipp von Stosch wore a monocle in Rome in the 1720s, in order to closely examine engravings and antique engraved gems, but the monocle did not become an article of gentlemen&#x27;s apparel until the 19th century. The dandy&#x27;s &quot;quizzing glass&quot; of the 1790s was an article of high fashion, which differs from the monocle in being held to one&#x27;s eye with a handle in a fashion similar to a lorgnette, rather than being held in place by the eye socket itself.

== Styles ==

There are three additional styles of the monocle. The first style consists of a simple loop of metal with a lens that was slotted into the eye orbit. These were the first monocles worn in England and could be found from the 1830s onwards. The second style, which was developed in the 1890s, was the most elaborate, consisting of a frame with a raised edge-like extension known as the &quot;gallery&quot;. The gallery was designed to help secure the monocle in place by raising it out of the eye&#x27;s orbit slightly so that the eyelashes would not jar it. Monocles with galleries were often the most expensive. The wealthy would have the frames custom-made to fit their eye sockets. A sub-category of the galleried monocle was the &quot;sprung gallery&quot;, where the gallery was replaced by an incomplete circle of flattened, ridged wire supported by three posts. The ends were pulled together, the monocle was placed in the eye orbit, and the ends were released, causing the gallery to spring out and keep the monocle in place.
The third style of monocle was frameless. This consisted of a cut piece of glass, with a serrated edge to provide a grip and sometimes a hole drilled into one side for a cord. Often the frameless monocle had no cord and would be worn freely. This style was popular at the beginning of the 20th century as the lens could be cut to fit any shape eye orbit inexpensively, without the cost of a customized frame.

If customized, monocles can be worn securely with little effort. However, periodic adjustment is common for monocle wearers to keep the monocle from popping. Often only the rich could afford to have a monocle custom-fabricated, while the poor had to settle for ill-fitting monocles that were less comfortable and less secure. In popular perception, a monocle could easily fall off with the wrong facial expression. A once-standard comedic device exploits this: an upper-class gentleman affects a shocked expression in response to some event, and his monocle falls into his drink or smashes to pieces on the floor.

== Wearers ==

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the monocle was generally associated with wealthy upper-class men. Combined with a morning coat and a top hat, the monocle completed the costume of the stereotypical 1890s capitalist. Monocles were also accessories of German military officers from this period, especially from World War I and World War II. German military officers known to have worn a monocle include Helmuth Weidling, Hans Krebs, Werner von Fritsch, Erich Ludendorff, Walter Model, Walter von Reichenau, Dietrich von Saucken, Wilhelm Keitel, Dietrich von Choltiz, Hans von Seeckt, and Hugo Sperrle.

Monocles were most prevalent in the late 19th century, but are rarely worn today. This is due in large part to advances in optometry which allow for better measurement of refractive error, so that glasses and contact lenses can be prescribed with different strengths in each eye.

The monocle did, however, gain a following in the stylish lesbian circles of the early 20th century, when lesbians would wear a monocle for effect. Such women included Una Lady Troubridge, Radclyffe Hall, and Weimar German reporter Sylvia von Harden; the painting &quot;Portrait of the Journalist Sylvia Von Harden&quot; by German expressionist painter Otto Dix depicts its subject wearing a monocle.

Monocle wearers have included British politicians Joseph Chamberlain, his son Austen, Henry Chaplin, and Angus Maude. Percy Toplis (The Monocled Mutineer), Astronomer and The Sky at Night Presenter Sir Patrick Moore, founder of Pakistan Mohammad Ali Jinnah, Portuguese President António de Spínola, filmmakers Fritz Lang and Erich von Stroheim, 19th-century Portuguese writer Eça de Queiroz, Soviet writer Mikhail Bulgakov, actor Conrad Veidt, Dadaists Tristan Tzara and Raoul Hausmann, esoteric-fascist Julius Evola, French collaborationist politician Louis Darquier de Pellepoix, Poet laureate Alfred Lord Tennyson, singer Richard Tauber, diplomat Christopher Ewart-Biggs (a smoked-glass monocle, to disguise his glass eye), Major Johnnie Cradock, actors Ralph Lynn, George Arliss and Martyn Green, and Karl Marx. In another vein, G. E. M. Anscombe was one of only a few noted women who occasionally wore a monocle. Abstract expressionist painter Barnett Newman wore a monocle mainly for getting a closer look at artworks. Richard Tauber wore a monocle to mask a squint in one eye. The Irish poet William Butler Yeats wore them at times too. The English author, Evelyn Waugh, used a monocle when he was in the Army during World War II and needed to focus his vision using a rifle at a shooting range during his initial training.

<text>The Book of Commandments is the earliest published book to contain the revelations of Joseph Smith Jr. Text published in the Book of Commandments is now considered scripture by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) as part of the larger Doctrine and Covenants.

== History of the Book of Commandments ==
The Book of Commandments was planned as a compilation of Joseph Smith Jr.&#x27;s early prophecies. Smith, leader of the Latter Day Saint movement, gathered several of his revelations for a High Priests council in November 1831. The ten-man council voted to print 10,000 copies, but the actual number of prints was reduced to between three and five thousand.

W. W. Phelps, publisher of the book, ran a press in Independence, Missouri. A faithful Mormon, Phelps also edited an historically important Mormon periodical, &quot;The Evening and Morning Star&quot; from September 1831 to July 1833. Most revelations in the Book of Commandments had been previously published by Phelps in the &quot;Star&quot;.

On July 20, 1833 an anti-Mormon and pro-slavery mob destroyed the press. The mob, purportedly frightened of Mormon political power, was incensed by an editorial in Phelps&#x27;s &quot;Evening and Morning Star&quot; perceived to be abolitionist. Breaking down the door, they razed Phelps&#x27;s home and business. At that point, 65 revelations of the Book of Commandments, about two thirds the total, were already printed. Totaling 160 pages, most of the uncut and unbound sheets were destroyed in the ensuing fire. However, some neighbors including teenage sisters Caroline and Mary Elizabeth Rollins saved remnants of nearly 100 copies.

Fewer than 30 are known to exist today, including several incomplete versions. Further enhancing the book&#x27;s scarcity, several copies of the &quot;Book of Commandments&quot; are held in permanent collections. For example, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and the Community of Christ have multiple copies, and the rare books divisions of the University of Utah Marriott Library, Brigham Young University Harold B. Lee Library, The Library of Congress, and the New York Public Library each own a copy. When sold on the open market, the book regularly fetches over $100,000. An incomplete copy changed hands for $200,000 in 2001, and a complete volume sold at auction for $391,000. Rare books dealer Ken Sanders claims a copy was sold privately in Utah for $500,000.

== Content of the Book of Commandments ==

Many of the revelations in the Book of Commandments were also printed in the official church newspaper &quot;Evening and Morning Star&quot;, with relatively superficial and typographical edits.

A much more ambitious revision was made in 1835, when all the revelations contained in the Book of Commandments were edited for inclusion in a larger text of Mormon scriptures called the Doctrine and Covenants. In addition to many superficial changes, this latter work contains significant redactions, deletions, and additions of new material to the older revelations, and the nature of these changes has been controversial, in part because these changes are not widely known by Mormon adherents, and in part because the changes have been used by secular Mormon scholars to support a hypothesis that Mormon theology developed gradually, and underwent theological reversals and significant changes. Apologetic scholars tend to minimize the significance of these changes, or to read the two editions of scripture in a way that makes them roughly consistent.

For example, mention of biblical apostles Peter, James, and John imparting Joseph Smith Jr. with the Priesthood is in section 27 of the Doctrine and Covenants, but is omitted from the equivalent chapter in the Book of Commandments.

Secular Mormon scholars argue that these changes reflect the changing doctrines of Joseph Smith, but Mormon apologetic scholars are more likely to hold that the changes are elaborations or clarifications of previously revealed doctrine. For example, a scripture often cited by Mormon critics says,

:&quot;...and he has a gift to translate the book and I have commanded him that he shall pretend to no other gift, for I will grant him no other gift.&quot; — Book of Commandments 4:2

This passage refers to Joseph Smith in third person. However, the re-numbered Doctrine and Covenants reads:

:&quot;...and this is the first gift that I bestowed upon you; and I have commanded that you should pretend to no other gift until my purpose is fulfilled in this; for I will grant unto you no other gift until it is finished.&quot; — Doctrine and Covenants 5:4

== Book of Commandments chapters and Doctrine and Covenants sections ==
Note that the units of the Book of Commandments are chapters, while the Doctrine and Covenants has sections. Chapters of the book correspond exactly to modern D&amp;C sections except for the revisions discussed above.

<text>A soil test is a laboratory or in-situ analysis to determine the chemical, physical or biological characteristics of a soil. Possibly the most widely conducted soil tests are those performed to estimate the plant-available concentrations of nutrients in order to provide fertilizer recommendations in agriculture. In geotechnical engineering, soil tests can be used to determine the current physical state of the soil, the seepage properties, the shear strength and the deformation properties of the soil. Other soil tests may be used in geochemical or ecological investigations.

== Agricultural soil tests ==
In agriculture, a soil test commonly refers to the analysis of a soil sample to determine nutrient content, composition, and other characteristics such as the acidity or pH level. A soil test can determine fertility, or the expected growth potential of the soil which indicates nutrient deficiencies, potential toxicities from excessive fertility and inhibitions from the presence of non-essential trace minerals. The test is used to mimic the function of roots to assimilate minerals. The expected rate of growth is modeled by the Law of the Maximum.

Labs, such as those at Iowa State and Colorado State University, recommend that a soil test contains 10-20 sample points for every of field. Tap water or chemicals can change the composition of the soil, and may need to be tested separately. As soil nutrients vary with depth and soil components change with time, the depth and timing of a sample may also affect results.

Composite sampling can be performed by combining soil from several locations prior to analysis. This is a common procedure, but should be used judiciously to avoid skewing results. This procedure must be done so that government sampling requirements are met. A reference map should be created to record the location and quantity of field samples in order to properly interpret test results.

=== Geographic distribution of samples for precision agriculture ===
In precision agriculture, soil samples may be geolocated using GPS technology in order to estimate the geospatial distribution of nutrients in the sampled area. The geolocated samples are collected using a distribution and resolution that allows for the estimation of the geospatial variability of the soil area where the crop will be grown. Many different distributions and resolutions are used, depending upon many factors including the goals of the geospatial nutrient analysis and cost of sample collection and analysis.

For example, in the United States corn and soybean growing regions a grid distribution with a resolution of 2.5 acres per grid (one sample for each 2.5 acre grid) is offered by many precision agriculture soil test service providers. This is generally referred to as grid soil testing.

=== Storage, handling, and moving ===
Soil chemistry changes over time, as biological and which chemical processes break down or combine compounds over time. These processes change once the soil is removed from its natural ecosystem (flora and fauna that penetrate the sampled area) and environment (temperature, moisture, and solar light/radiation cycles). As a result, the chemical composition analysis accuracy can be improved if the soil is analyzed soon after its extraction — usually within a relative time period of 24 hours. The chemical changes in the soil can be slowed during storage and transportation by freezing it. Air drying can also preserve the soil sample for many months.

===Lab testing===

Soil testing is often performed by commercial labs that offer a variety of tests, targeting groups of compounds and minerals. Laboratory tests often check for plant nutrients in three categories:
* Major nutrients: nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium
* Secondary nutrients: sulfur, calcium, magnesium
* Minor nutrients: iron, manganese, copper, zinc, boron, molybdenum, chlorine

The amount of plant-available phosphorus is most often measured with a chemical extraction method, and different countries have different standard methods. Just in Europe, more than 10 different soil phosphorus tests are currently in use and the results from these different tests are not directly comparable.

Do-it-yourself kits usually only test for the three &quot;major nutrients&quot;, and for soil acidity or pH level. Do-it-yourself kits are often sold at farming cooperatives, university labs, private labs, and some hardware and gardening stores. Electrical meters that measure pH, water content, and sometimes nutrient content of the soil are also available at many hardware stores. Laboratory tests are more accurate than tests with do-it-yourself kits and electrical meters. An example soil sample report is provided for reference by Wallace Laboratories LLC.

In order to avoid complex and expensive analytical techniques, prediction based on regression equations relating to more easily measurable parameters can be provided by pedotransfer functions. For instance, soil bulk density can be predicted using easily measured soil properties such as soil texture, pH and organic matter. 

Soil testing is used to facilitate fertilizer composition and dosage selection for land employed in both agricultural and horticultural industries.

Prepaid mail-in kits for soil and ground water testing are available to facilitate the packaging and delivery of samples to a laboratory. Similarly, in 2004, laboratories began providing fertilizer recommendations along with the soil composition report.

Lab tests are more accurate and often utilize very precise flow injection technology (or Near InfraRed (NIR) scanning). In addition, lab tests frequently include professional interpretation of results and recommendations. Provisory statements included in a lab report may outline any anomalies, exceptions, and shortcomings in the sampling, analytical process or results.

Some laboratories analyze for all 13 mineral nutrients and a dozen non-essential, potentially toxic minerals utilizing the &quot;universal soil extractant&quot; (ammonium bicarbonate DTPA).

== Engineering soil testing ==
In geotechnical engineering, a soil test can be used to determine the physical characteristics of a soil, such as its water content, void ratio or bulk density. Soil testing can also provide information related to the shear strength, rate of consolidation and permeability of the soil. The following is a non-exhaustive list of engineering soil tests.
==Soil contaminants==
Common mineral soil contaminants include arsenic, barium, cadmium, copper, mercury, lead, and zinc.

Lead is a particularly dangerous soil component. The following table from the University of Minnesota categorizes typical soil concentration levels and their associated health risks.
The following is a non-exhaustive list of recommendations to limit exposure to lead in garden soils:
# Locate gardens away from old painted structures and heavily traveled roads
# Give planting preferences to fruiting crops (tomatoes, squash, peas, sunflowers, corn, etc.)
# Incorporate organic materials such as finished compost, humus, and peat moss
# Lime soil as recommended by soil test (a pH of 6.5 minimizes lead availability)
# Discard old and outer leaves before eating leafy vegetables; peel root crops; wash all produce
# Keep dust to a minimum by maintaining a mulched and/or moist soil surface
